         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is lately come forth a <hi>Coale</hi> from the <hi>Altar,</hi> and behinde it a Letter to the Vicar of Grantham: The Author of either of these is to me utterly unknowne. My speech therefore must needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, and my personall reflections none at all.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> is marked by the <hi>Coale</hi> to bee the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that Epistle: This man I knew well in <hi>Cambridge</hi> to have humanity-learning of his owne: And if I may know him by this Letter, then I am sure, hee hath taken his Divinity upon trust. Hereby he hath made a double forfeiture, of the Merchants faith, and of his owne, and laboured to his owne losse, and theirs that beleeve in him, if he make not both good.</p>
            <p>It is twenty yeares and upward, since he was translated from the body of <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge, to be made a member of a new bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy severed from the ancient Clergy of <hi>England</hi> (as King <hi>Iames</hi> of famous memory in his Directions speakes) to become neither Parson, Vicar, nor Curat; but Lecturer of <hi>Boston.</hi> It is therfore hard to determine, which of his Diocesans he doth personate in that Letter.</p>
            <p>Wherefore this <hi>Quaere</hi> we must leave, as the servants did the inquirie after him that had sowen tares, and was stept aside, to their Masters detection. Their Master told them it was the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious man that had done it, but named him not, whereby they perceived, that the apprehension of the malefactor concerned not them so much, as the plucking up of the tares.</p>
            <p>The case is ours; The tares which the pen-man hath brought out of his treasures of late writers misunderstood, the Authour of the <hi>Coale</hi> hath pluckt up. What he hath fetcht from their Elders, my endeavour, by Gods assistance, may in some part weede out. Thus having brought you acquainted with my scope, I betake my selfe, and you both, to God, and the working of his grace, <hi>farewell.</hi>

Take we then a view of the <hi>Christian Church</hi> in the Old Testament, and there we find the name and use of <hi>Altars</hi> is above eight hundred yeares more ancient, than the name of <hi>Tables</hi> in Gods Service. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, by the light of nature infused into them, without any direction or speciall command; or rather by inspiration of <hi>Christs blessed Spirit,</hi> who delighted to walk with the sonnes of men, erected <hi>Altars.

            <p>Whether the Church of God before <hi>Moses</hi> was called <hi>Christian,</hi> I will not dispute: but sure I am, that it had the same Christ that we have, for their

Saviour, and we are assured out of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> that it was <hi>Populus Christianus,</hi> it was a Christian Church, if it were a Church at all, which no Christian can doubt of.

            <p>WHereas it is said that Christians could have no <hi>Altars</hi> within two hundred yeares of Christ, because they had no Churches in all that space: This maketh as much for the overthrowing of <hi>Tables,</hi> as for the removing of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars.</hi> For if there were no Churches in all that time, then there was no Table. Then is not the <hi>name of Table two hundred yeares more ancient in the Christian Church, than the name of Altar,</hi> by that reason.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Those that first made this objection were Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, whose malicious speeches Christians should not make use of to the prejudice of their owne religion. Not <hi>Origen,</hi> but <hi>Celsus</hi> in <hi>Origen:</hi> nor <hi>Minutius Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> but <hi>Caecilius</hi> in him do object against Christians, <hi>Quod tanquam athei nulla haberent Templa, nec Deos, nec Altaria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Those Heathens that say we had no <hi>Altars,</hi> do not say we had Communion-Tables two hundred years before there were <hi>Altars</hi> in the Christian Church. Wherefore this authority borrowed from Heathens, will not furnish this man with a Table two hundred yeares before there were <hi>Altars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. It is true, Christians in the Primitive Church had no Temples, that is, such magnificent Temples, as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15180:10"/>
were dedicated to Heathen gods: but they had Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from the beginning of Christianity. Neither had they <hi>Altars</hi> to sacrifice beasts on, but they had <hi>Altars</hi> for the offering up of their Christian Sacrifices: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they worship Heathen gods, but a God that made Heaven and Earth. <hi>Deos vestros</hi> (saith <hi>Tertullian</hi>) <hi>colere des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>&amp;c. verbo quo jussit, ratione qua disposuit, virtute qua potuit, ex nihilo expressit, in ornamentum majestatis suae.</hi> The like answer is given in sundry places to <hi>Celsus</hi> by <hi>Origen.</hi> The Heathen therefore did them wrong to charge them with Atheisme, because they departed from their Idolatry, and renounced their <hi>Temples, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> and gods. For God they worshipped, and <hi>Altars</hi> they had, as both <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> before him, and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> before them both do plainly witnesse.</p>
            <p>Now that Christians had Churches, and <hi>Altars</hi> for Christian Sacrifices, from S. <hi>Pauls</hi> time, till the time of <hi>Constantine the Great</hi> (notwithstanding the many and bloudy persecutions raised against them,) is so cleere a truth, that I wonder any man of learning should deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the contrary. For what service they can doe the Church in maintaining an untruth, I cannot imagine.</p>
            <p>True it is, some Christians in the Apostles times, and after, till <hi>Constantines</hi> raigne, and when he was gone al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, were forced, first for feare of Heathens, and after for feare of Hereticks, were constrained sometime to meet in private houses, and vacant places: and as the Apostle saith,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.38.</note> wandred in Desarts, and Mountaines, and Dens, and Caves of the Earth: yet for all that the greatest part of Christians had both Churches and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> all this time. And their Churches were distinct

from private houses;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.22.</note> 
               <hi>Have yee not houses to eate and to drink? despise ye the Church of God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.23.</note> These Churches were common houses of great receipt.

Io. Ep. 10.</note> for he cast godly men out of the Church. These Churches had stocks of money belonging to them, which were dispensed by the direction of their Bishops to such as were admitted into the Church to be so relieved,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5 9, 14, 16.</note> as Widowes of 60. yeares of age;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 16.1.</note> but young and idle Widowes were not to have any such allowance.<note place="margin">Tit. 1.5.</note> There was in these dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous times a visible Church.<note place="margin">Act. 20.31.</note> There were Bishops and Presbyters to governe it.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.18.20.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe, with these Presbyters at <hi>Ephesus</hi> three yeeres together. And it is manifest, that they came together into one place to serve God, and this one place S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith is a Church. How can it then be said, that there was no Christian Church built in the Apostles time: but that they met only in private houses. I maintaine not the fabrick and endowment of those Churches to be all one with ours.</p>
            <p>Our Churches by God's mercy are a glory to our Religion; the fruits not of piety only, but of peace and plenty: are environed with Churchyards, are fairely built of Stone, covered with Lead, beautified with
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15180:11"/>
goodly Glasse-windowes, Pinnacles, Battlements, have their Porches, severall Iles, Belfreyes, Steeples, Bels. In the body of these Churches are placed Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, Seats, Pewes, and the Baptisterion or Font to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the West, together with the poore-mans-Box; To the Chancels belonged the Vestry, Lavatory, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pository, and Reclinatories for hearing confessions. Our Churches are endowed with Gleb-lands, Tythes, Houses, Gardens, and Orchards, for Parsons, Vicars, Prebendaries, Deans, and Bishops. Our Churches, with their Parishes, have their severall limits, bounds, and Precincts. Now to imagine the continuance of all these in this compleat and flourishing estate ever since the Apostles times, were to build Castles in the aire. The piety of Princes, and devotion of God's people in aftertimes gave beauty and wealth to Churches.</p>
            <p>But when I avouch the being and use of Churches in the Apostles times, I pray conceive, I meane true materiall Churches, but sutable to the condition of the Apostles, and Apostle-like men of those times. Those times had Woodden Chalices, but Golden Priests. The Churches were woodden, poore and base, but the Church-men were like polished Saphyrs. They were poore in earthly revenewes, but rich in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly treasure.</p>
            <p>But Churches, I am well assured, they had in the Apostles time, for the Saints of God to meet in at least every Lord's-day: made at first of private houses, dedicated by the Owners; and in such sort consecrated by the Apostles, and Bishops their successors, to the Lord's service, that they could never more returne to their former common use, to eat and drink, to lye down and sleepe in: but were imployed only for the worship
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15180:11"/>
of God, reading, and expounding of Scripture, singing of Psalmes; for supplications, prayers, and giving of thanks, and receiving the holy Eucharist.</p>
            <p>And all these holy offices were performed in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and reverend order, some in the first, and others in the second service.</p>
            <p>True it is, they were the houses of private men, which were at first converted into the Houses of God; and whether they were Chambers or Parlors, upper or lower roomes; whether covered with Thatch or Reed, Tyle or Slate: whether paved with Stone, or beaten plaine with the feet of the frequenters, I will not take upon me to define.</p>
            <p>But how ever they were made and prepared, none, I am sure, was so irreligious to come into the Lord's-house, as then it was, especially on the Lord's-day, without his oblation; which being then by the Priest collected, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d put into the Treasury, amounted to so good a famine, that therewith Captives, Prisoners, sick and needy persons were relieved, Widowes maintained, and the Elders that ruled well were doubly honoured.</p>
            <p>These poore and contemptible Churches were at the very first so distinguished, that <hi>Audientes, Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Believers,</hi> and <hi>Priests,</hi> yea, and <hi>Penit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nts,</hi> had their severall places to set them apart one from another. These poore Churches shined not with gold or preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous stones, but were illustrious and glorious by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of Priests, holinesse of <hi>Altars,</hi> where they alone waited; and the holinesse of the blessed Eucharist that was thereon, and could not elsewhere be consecrated.</p>
            <p>The maintenance, and Mansion-houses belonging to these Churches and Church-men, persecution made uncertaine to the chiefest of them, more than to the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15180:12"/>
rest. For unto this very day, <hi>We both hunger, &amp;c. thirst &amp;c. are naked, &amp;c. have no certaine dwelling place,</hi> saith he, that knew both how to abound, and how to want: how to enjoy the revenewes of devotion, and to endure the misery of persecution.</p>
            <p>The knees of Camels shewed well, that the practise of piety was then performed, in kneeling before their Saviour and Redeemer. The stooles they had were either none, or none but fall-stooles, to come <hi>and fall downe and kneele before the Lord their Maker.</hi> Ambition to step up into the highest roomes and seats, and there to inclose and inthronize themselves, was confined to Pharisaicall Feasts, or Synagogues: holy men had no such custome, sought no such state or ease; neither the Churches of God.</p>
            <p>It is plaine enough they had Churches for God's service, and as evident it is that they had <hi>Altars.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> sayes in plaine termes, <hi>We have an Alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The Bishops of those times were contented to yeeld themselves to be sacrificed, to keepe their Churches from ruine.

they duly exercised the power of the Keyes, casting out some, and receiving others into the Church; and if they had such a great number of Priests and Deacons in some one Church, it is to be thought that innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble multitude of Christians resorted to their service: all which being put together, it cannot be denied with reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that they had Churches to assemble in. <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> feared more the multitude, than the religion of the Christians.<note place="margin">Euseb. l. 7. c. 12.</note>

after delinquents had perfectly fulfilled their penance, they were reconciled to the Sacraments, and communicated. This distinction of places, in the Church, is very ancient: Therefore their mistake must needs be great, that say, there were no Churches built, till 200. yeares after CHRIST. That Churches had Portches, where Penitents humbled themselves, before the Canon was made, ascribed to <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Neocaesa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> appeareth plainly, because <hi>Origen,</hi> after his fall, cast himselfe downe there, and prayed all that came into the Church,<note place="margin">

               </note> to trample upon him, as unsavoury salt. <hi>Natalius</hi> also, who made himselfe Bishop of the heresie of <hi>Artemon,</hi> for a salary of 150<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. a moneth, did the like before <hi>Origen</hi> did his.

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:15180:19"/>There may also be found very good ground for the distinction of the other places in the Church before mentioned. It appeares out of S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit stood in an eminent place in the Church; yet in such a place where the whole multitude assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.

            <p>They that say there were no materiall Churches built till 200. yeares after Christ, are more injurious to the Church, and unjust to themselves, and to all true members of the Catholicke Church, than perhaps every one is aware. For if in all this time there were no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall Churches, then there could bee no materiall Chaire, wherein their Bishops were enthronized, and if no Chaire, then no reall inthronization, then no perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall succession from the Apostles, whereby the right faith was derived from God the Father, to his Sonne, whom he hath sent into the world out of his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, nor from the Sonne to his Apostles, nor from the

But who delivered them the keyes of the bottomlesse pit, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne whom they list?

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15180:23"/>
much as to tax the Dedication of Churches for a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of Iniquity. But some of all these sorts have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, commended, and practised the Dedication of Churches. Where then the Doctrine and Decrees of <hi>Popes,</hi> and of the first and best times, are confirmed by the doctrine and constant practice of the holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church, it seemes great boldnesse and impiety in three or foure men, to condemne and to brand their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the Mysterie of Iniquity. It appeareth by the testimonies of <hi>Eusebius, Athanasius, Basil, Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi> alledged by the Centurists <hi>Gent.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. and of <hi>S.

Ambrose, Greg. Magnus,</hi> and diverse others in all ages, that have approved, and with great devotion and piety practised the Dedication of Churches: O then that there should be a mouth opened to such blasphemy! But to let them stand to their owne Master; whether the worke were good or bad, it is confessed on all hands, that there were Churches dedicated within 200. yeares of Christ; therefore the Centurists will helpe to cry downe their opinion, that say there were none built in all that space.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> the use of the keyes, and the exercise of the discipline of the Church in excommunication, absten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, giving absolution, and receiving Penitens into the Church, all which were of famous and frequent use within 200. yeares after Christ, doe manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that there were Churches built within that space. For how Deliquents should be excommunicated out of Dens, Forrests, or private houses, or solemnely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into them againe, is beyond any common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding. If we cast our eyes upon the discipline
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:15180:24"/>
used in the Primitive Church in casting out, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men againe into the Church, we shall finde, that it was executed so solemnely, gravely, and impartially, yet with such pitty and fellow-feeling of humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, as made the same very awfull and reverend, and struck the mindes aswell of those that stood, as of such as had fallen, with griefe and terrour. None that had fallen into any notorious crime, to the publike scandall of their brethren, and to the wounding of weake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, were admitted againe into the Church, before they had done open penance in sackcloth and ashes, with fasting and prayer.<note place="margin">Euseb l. 3.23.</note> Thus was the Young-man, who had committed many notorious robberies, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againe into the Church by S. <hi>Iohn, Anno</hi> 100.

were built in all Bishops Sees, and Metropolitane Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and belonged to the Church? Can any man imagine then, that there were no Churches built within 200. yeares after Christ, for the Bishop, Clergy, and people of God to meet in? Since the only end, why these were built, was to fit men for Gods Service in the Church. In Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> time there was a Schoole,<note place="margin">Euseb. 3.23.</note> and Church neere unto <hi>Ephesus:</hi> for himselfe did commend a young man to the Arch-Bishop, to be brought up, <hi>Anno.</hi> 100.

In <hi>Rome</hi> there was both a Church and a Schoole. For <hi>Anthia</hi> brought <hi>Eleutherius</hi> thither to bee brought up under <hi>Anicetus,</hi>

And we may perceive by <hi>Tertullian</hi> and others, what the reason was why these Schooles were erected, namely for education of Youth and Converts in the Catechisme, and doctrine of the Church, that they might bee fitted to partake the Sacraments of the Church, and so in the end attaine to holy Orders, as they should bee thought worthy by the Governours of the Church.</p>
            <p>For we must know, that there were many degrees for men to passe through, before the Church would admit them to the Sacrament of Baptisme and Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, or receive them into holy Orders. And their Schooles and Libraries were of singular use to fit them for these purposes. First they sent their children, being come to yeeres of good discretion, and such also as took liking to Christian Religion, to these Schooles, to be brought up under Governors appointed for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:15180:27"/>
These Governours were called <hi>Catechistae,</hi> and entred early into the Church, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.4. Such an one was <hi>Origen,</hi> and those that were before him in the Church of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>

            <p>And now (I pray you) tell mee if M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cotton,</hi> or his <hi>Vmbra</hi> here have not spun a faire thread. There were
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15180:31"/>
no Churches within 200. yeares of Christ; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, there were no Schooles in all that time; and if no Schooles, then none of all these degrees, and distinction of places, names; no <hi>Educati, Audientes, Catechumeni, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petentes,</hi> no, not <hi>Fideles</hi> neither, and least of all <hi>Diaconi,</hi> and <hi>Sacerdotes.</hi> For Deacons and Priests, after long try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all were chosen out of the ranke of <hi>Fideles</hi>; and these must first of all be <hi>Neophyti</hi>; and these <hi>Competentes</hi>; and <hi>Competentes</hi> must first be <hi>Catechumeni</hi>; and these must be <hi>Audientes,</hi> and <hi>Educati.</hi> And if there were no Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, nor Priests for 200. yeares after Christ, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and derive power of Ordination and Consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Apostles, to their successors; I am sure there are none now. Then may M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cotton,</hi> by vertue of an extraordinary spirit, set up a Church of his owne: Then have some of our Lecturers rose of their right sides; for these may speak as long as their Lungs last, and never care for comming into Orders, as <hi>Origen</hi> did. I have often beene thinking, why the chiefe of this new Corporation have beene so loath to take Benefices, to read the Prayers of the Church, and to Administer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, as Deacons and Priests should doe; and my wit would never serve me to dive into the mystery, till this lucky man came with his open Letter in his hand, as <hi>Sanballat</hi> did, to disturbe the Church of the Iewes. And from him I understand the cause. For he saith like <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> the High Priest, You understand nothing; know you not that wee conforme our selves to the Primitive Church? And in the Primitive Church, and for 200. yeares after Christ there were no Churches. Why this is full, and satisfactory. For then every Child can conclude, if there were no Churches, there were neither Diocesse nor Parish belonging to them, nor Priests, nor
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:15180:32"/>
degrees, out of which those Priests and Deacons should be taken. I believe that in those times some did stand, and some did speak, and some did Lecture; and to doe these no orders are required: and hereunto these men conforme themselves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as they had Schooles and degrees, so likewise had they publike Libraries furnished with use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and necessary books, to fit such as were in the place of Auditors and others in time to be serviceable in the Church.<note place="margin">Euseb. 2.18.</note> 
               <hi>Eusebius</hi> tels us that <hi>Philo</hi> his bookes were chained up in the publike Library at <hi>Rome, Anno</hi> 39. The bookes also of <hi>Origen</hi> were placed in a publike Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary in <hi>Caesarea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euseb. 6.31.</note> after that of a Lecturer he took holy Orders. <hi>Alexander</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> built a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Library there,<note place="margin">Euseb. 6.20.</note> from whence <hi>Eusebius</hi> had his helpes for compiling of his History, <hi>Anno</hi> 197. And if they had publike Libraries to preserve bookes, and Schooles for Professors to read them, and Scholers to be trained up under them to do the Church service, and for no other end at all; can we imagine they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Churches for those to serve God in, whom they had fitted and inabled for that purpose? This were to imagine Mariners, Calkers, and Pilots, 200. yeares before there were any Ships. It were weaknesse to think, that their Persecutors would give leave to build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Schooles, and Libraries, but not of Churches; for they hated all alike: As appeareth by <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> who spared their bookes and Libraries, no more than he did their Churches, but burnt and destroyed all.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they had publike Treasuries to keepe the goods of the Church that came unto them by Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other revenues, whereby the members of the Church that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>If then this were true, which this unadvised man would make the <hi>Vicar</hi> believe, that there were no <hi>Altars,</hi> nor Churches neither within 200. yeares after Christ, it must needs follow that the holy <hi>Eucharist</hi> was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by any of the Holy Martyrs and blessed Saints of God in all the Primitive Church, or else that they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive some kinde of Sacrament that was not Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For <hi>Eucharistia in Altari Sanctificatur,</hi> is a ground on which he sets his rest, as the Fathers before him, and his successours ever did. I must needs therefore conclude, that if Schismaticks doe not build <hi>Altars</hi> in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of this man, for the good service hee hath done them, they are very ungratefull. For by outing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and driving them out of their Churches into Woods and solitary places to Administer the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in, hee hath set the very true Character of Schismaticks, and Hereticks upon the face of the holy Catholicke Church, that now you shall not know the one from the other; And what is lawfull for the one to doe, shall bee as lawfull for others. Neither can derive
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:15180:34"/>
their Succession, nor Ordination, nor power of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration from Christ and his Apostles. Therefore both Sacraments, and Sacramentalls may bee administred by all that list, and when they list, and where they list, and as they list; and they can shew as good evidence, and authority for their so doing, as the best of them all that shall controle them. And if any shall censure them, they must looke to have as good as they bring, censure for censure, and excommunication for excommunication. For in the Primitive Church for 200. yeares together, there was haile fellow well-met, all equalls, no <hi>Audien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> no <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> no <hi>Competentes,</hi> no <hi>Neophyti,</hi> no <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> no <hi>Priests,</hi> or if there were <hi>Deacons,</hi> or such Anti-christian names as Priests, there were no Sacraments for them to administer, no <hi>Eucharist</hi> to deliver; or if they delivered it, they gave it before it was Consecrated, for they had no Church, nor <hi>Altar</hi> to Consecrate the same upon, and <hi>Eucharistia in Altari Consecratur</hi>; wee are sure out of all antiquity, that the <hi>Eucharist</hi> must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated on an <hi>Altar.</hi> These then being the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which must necessarily follow if there were no Churches, nor <hi>Altars,</hi> within 200. yeares of Christ, I hope the Author will repeale his assertion, and yeeld un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Truth uncontrollable, that there were Churches and <hi>Altars</hi> not only within 200. yeares after Christ, but all those 200. yeares together, and were then, and ever since in the holy Christian Church. And so I have done with that point.</p>

            </head>
            <p>BY that which hath beene said, I conceive the Author of this Letter stands convinced in his understanding, that there were Churches, and <hi>Altars</hi> within 200. yeares after Christ. The next point to be enquired after, is, whether it did stand in the upper end of the Quire, or in the body of the Church. For where it did stand in the Primitive, there I suppose it ought to stand, if the Canons of our Church have not otherwise ordered it. To both these I shall speake briefly, and in order.</p>
            <p>Touching the first, how the <hi>Altar</hi> or Lords Board stood in the best times; whether in the Quire, or in the body of the Church, as this Author would have it, is in part manifest by that which hath beene already said. And the affinity, that the placing of the <hi>Altar</hi> hath with the being of <hi>Altars,</hi> and Churches within 200. yeares of Christ, will quit mee of the trouble of a long discourse touching that matter.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Altar</hi> did not, nor could stand in the Nave, or body of the Church, commonly called, <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium,</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:15180:35"/>
these reasons following seeme to be very strong. For then it should be exposed to such as were by the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Church <hi>abstenti,</hi> or Excommunicate, and to those, that were otherwise prohibited, as <hi>Poenitentes, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumeni</hi> and <hi>Audientes.</hi> Now all these were not only inhibited the use, and participation of the Holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, but also the very sight, and beholding of those my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries.</p>

Arcl. ca. 15.</note> But the Woman received it <hi>in Secreto,</hi> from whence the place was called <hi>Secretorium.</hi> This appeareth also by the History of <hi>Numerianus.</hi> The Emperour being entred into the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired onely <hi>per transennam inspicere mysteria Christiano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>; but <hi>Babylas</hi> Bishop there, resolutely withstood him, and told him plainly, that it was unlawfull for him that was defiled with Idols, to enter so boldly into the Church,<note place="margin">Nicep. l. 6. ca. 33.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Altar</hi> must needs stand in that place which was appointed for the Priests to Officiate in. Now the place appointed for them to wait and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister at, was not in the middest of the Chancell,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15180:36"/>

               <note place="margin">Decret. Vrban.</note> the Chaire, or Bishops Throne. This seat stood in such convenient distance from the <hi>Altar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Gangr. c. 7.8.</note> that the Bishop might see what Oblations were there offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the dispencing whereof belonged to his charge. Thirdly in the middest of the Quire kneeled the <hi>Laicks,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Cypr. l. 4. Epist. 2. &amp; lib. 2.

Fourthly, at the upper end of the Chancell was a place inclosed, and rayled in from the rest of the Chancell, whereunto none, neither Priests that were penitents,<note place="margin">Concil. Nic. 1. c. 14.</note> nor Deacons, were permitted to enter, and there to communicate and officiate in the consecration of the Eucharist, or in the administration thereof unto Priests, but they themselves. This place was called <hi>Sacrarium</hi>; here stood the <hi>Altar</hi> or Lord's-Table, and hitherto none might approach, but the Priests them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

Take this cleered in the History of <hi>Theodofius</hi> his offring: when the time came (saith <hi>Theodoret</hi>) <hi>quo ad Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mensam munera offerrentur, surrexit similiter plorans,</hi>

Communion Tables, according to <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop Iewel,</hi> stood in the Presbytery. The Presbytery is not the body of the Church.</head>
            <p>I Will speake first to the Rubricke, which all men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge for a Canon: then to the booke which the <hi>Vicar</hi> is bound to read, and commanded so to do. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rubricke; It is fit we expound one Rubricke by another, and what is briefly and obscurely set downe in one, to supply and expound out of another. The Table shall stand in the body of the Church, or Chancell, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> saith the Rubrick before the Communion: But the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick before Morning Prayer, seemes to put in a double exception, or Caution. 1. <hi>Except it shall be otherwise de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Ordinary of the place.</hi> 2. <hi>And the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:15180:38"/>
shall remaine, as they have done in times past.</hi> The place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of reading of Prayers, in the first part of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke, is left to the determination of the Ordinary of the place, and upon good reason, because some part of those prayers, as namely the First Service is to be read <hi>in Auditorio,</hi> or body of the Church; And some part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, namely the Second Service, ought to be read only in <hi>Sacrario</hi>; if the ancient practise of holy Church be enquired after. But the later part of the Rubrick, which concernes Chancels themselves, and so, by necessary consequence, the essential parts of the Chancell, as in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Churches, the Priests Stals, the Bishops Throne, and the Lords Table, or holy <hi>Altar,</hi> with the railes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is environed, to keep it from all manner of propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and to preserve it entire, and apart for the Priests to officiate in, these shall remaine as in times past. The ordering of these things, otherwise than they were in times past, is not referred (be it spoken under correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) to the determination of the Ordinary of the place, much lesse to any <hi>Vicar</hi> or Parson to make a <hi>Daedalus</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of the Lords Table, and so to set the Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Wheeles, and so to run it out of the pious, and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend practice of holy and unreproved Antiquity. The Rubricke allowes no such liberty. Let no man therefore invade the Churches right, or goe about to remove the ancient bounds in this particular, that hee bring not a curse upon himselfe. The Church (I confesse) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent enough to these fancifull, and popular men; yet it is to be hoped, she will not suffer her ancient Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markes to bee pluckt up, and throwne by, to please new fangled people withall. For <hi>hoc ratum &amp; fixum,</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels shall remaine as they have done in times past: which is not to bee understood of walls and windowes only,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:15180:39"/>
but of the fixing of the Lords Table, which is the maine part of the Chancell considerable in the service of God, the ordering whereof is determined in the Rubricke, when it is said, Chancels should remaine as in times past.</p>
            <p>Now if the <hi>Vicar</hi> will know from the Author, how Chancels have remained in times past, and how Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion Tables have stood in the midst of the Church, he must read a booke which he is bound to read, <hi>Iewell</hi> against <hi>Harding, and hee shall be satisfied.</hi> And so I am fallen upon the second point, which I have bound my selfe to speake unto, namely to the booke which the <hi>Vicar</hi> is commanded to read, and told that he is bound to read it.</p>
            <p>For the Injunction or command laid upon the <hi>Vicar,</hi> I thinke I may say thus much; that for any man to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a Priest, that is not under his Iurisdiction, what book to read, is a Prerogative and authority, that sideth with <hi>Archiepiscopall,</hi> or Regall rather. <hi>King Iames</hi> of happy memory, I wot well, sent us his directions to <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> (Doctor <hi>Cary</hi> being then Vicechancelor) for the reading of <hi>Peter Lombard, Thom. Aquinas,</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers, as may appeare in the Register of that Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity. Now if the Royall command of his Majesty, of happy memory, had beene as well observed by all Students of Divinity there, as it is doubtlesse safely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the Office, the <hi>Vicar</hi> needed not to bee sent to Schoole, and bidden to read a booke of this mans ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, to see how Communion Tables have stood in the body of the Church; for he had beene able en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to send his carefull instructer from the River to the Fountaine.</p>
            <p>But he biddeth him read no other book, than what he is bound to read, and that swelleth not up to the height of a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:15180:39"/>
command, but is confined within the precincts of a friendly advice, to have an eye to what hee is bound to read. Such Evangelicall Councell, I confesse, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Cotton</hi> much better, than to arrogate a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and execute his superintendency in that kind: For his advice then; So farre forth as Bishop <hi>Iewel, Bullinger, Erasmus,</hi> and the like doe explaine unto us the true, and Orthodoxe doctrine of our Church, we are bound in reason, as occasion serveth, not only to have them, but to read them: The like may be said for the reading of <hi>God and the King</hi>; And if some men read such bookes more, and some such as the other, lesse; I doubt not, but they did read such bookes as they are bound to read, as well as any of these.</p>
            <p>Well, in the <hi>Vicars</hi> behalfe, I have read the booke ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and therein have satisfied the Authors desire. Now I make bold to call upon him reciprocally to make good his ingagement, that undertaketh that the Reader shall bee satisfied out of Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> how Communion Tables stood in the body of the Church.</p>
            <p>How Communion Tables have stood in the body of the Church, I doe not finde in Bishop <hi>Iewell.</hi> But what I finde I will tell you, and then tell you me, if Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> doe not say, or prove at least, that the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Table or Altar did not stand in the body of the Church. According to Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> the Communion Table or Altar, (for he useth both words) stood in the Quire: The Quire was divided with rayles from the rest of the Church. This Quire so rayled in was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called of the Greeke <hi>Presbyterium.</hi> This <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> was especially appointed for Priests. It was shut up from all others for disturbing the holy Ministery. This appeareth notably in the story of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> who willed
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:15180:40"/>
the Emperour <hi>Theodosius</hi> himselfe to depart forth; And by <hi>Nazianzenus</hi> in the life of S. <hi>Basil:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Concil. Laod. ca. 19.</note> And for further proofe how the <hi>Alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> stood, Bishop <hi>Iewel</hi> referreth the Reader to the Councell of <hi>Laodicea, Can.</hi> 19. where it is thus determined; That the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> doe pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and that they be dismissed before the Penitents be admitted into the Church by imposition of hands: <hi>Tunc Fideles orare debent</hi>; When all these are dismissed, then the Faithfull are to performe their devotions. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis autem ministris Altaris liceat ingredi ad Altare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; ibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem communicare:</hi> The Ministers of the <hi>Altar</hi> may on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter within the lists of the <hi>Altar,</hi> and there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. Lastly, saith Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> it may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that at certaine times of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice that place was drawne with Curtaines.</p>
            <p>Now let all this be put together, and then resolve whether the Vicar may see out of Bishop <hi>Iewel,</hi> how <hi>Communion Tables have stood in the body of the Church.</hi> 1. The Presbytery was neither in the Greek, nor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Church, taken for the body of the Church, no more than Presbyter was taken for a Layman. 2. No Laiman, neither <hi>Catechumenꝰ nec Poenitens,</hi> neither <hi>Iew</hi> nor <hi>Gentile,</hi> Heathen man, or Heretick, much lesse any Christian Emperour was shut out of the body of the Church. 3. The body of the Church was never called <hi>Sacrariu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> into which none but Priests might enter and there Communicate. 4. The body of the Church was never the place set apart for Oblations to be made in. 5. The body of the Church was at no time of the Service drawne with Curtaines. Therefore the holy <hi>Altar,</hi> (that stood in a place that was sometimes drawne with Curtaines, that was at all times railed in from the rest, that was set a part only for Priests, that was ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:15180:40"/>
for Oblations, that was fixed in the Presbytery,) cannot, acccording to Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> be set in the body of the Church. If then the Vicar stand bound to read this book of Bishop <hi>Iewels,</hi> he is bound to believe the authorities which Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> bringeth, and not to mistake them, (as this Penman does,) but to understand them aright; and then he shall see, how Communion Tables have not stood in the midst of the Church, but in the higher part of the Church, wherein the Vicar hath the Authors assent already in opinion, though he settle it otherwise for the Men of <hi>Granthams</hi> sake.</p>

            <p>IN the next place I will examine the Authors out of which he saith, the <hi>Vicar</hi> may know how <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Tables</hi> stood in the body of the Church. And he shall give me leave to say, that whatsoever he can know out of any of these Authors, he shall never know how <hi>Communion Tables</hi> stood at all; much lesse how they stood in the body of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:15180:41"/>The word used in those Authors is <hi>Mensa Domini,</hi> or <hi>Altare,</hi> not <hi>Communionis mensa,</hi> the <hi>Communion Table.</hi> For though the word <hi>Communion Table</hi> be a fit and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient word, yet it came not in so soone, but it came in (I will not impeach the comming in thereof, nor speak so unreverently as he doth of <hi>Altars,</hi> and say it crept in) but it came in, long after the youngest of these Authors went out of the Church Militant, into the Church Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant. Therefore it will be hard to know out of them, how <hi>Communion Tables</hi> stood, which he shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver finde in any of them at all, nor in any before them, nor in the holy Scripture, nor in any after them, till <hi>Anno</hi> 1552. For in King <hi>Edwards Liturgie</hi> (saith the Author) of 1549. it is every where, but in that of 1552. it is no where called an <hi>Altar,</hi> but the Lord's board. From whence then we may gesse, when <hi>Communion Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> came in.</p>
            <p>But if out of these Authors he can make the Vicar know, how the <hi>Lord's board,</hi> or holy <hi>Altar</hi> stood in the body of the Church, the Vicar will not stand upon the name of <hi>Communion Table</hi> any longer.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to take his Authors in their order, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with <hi>Eusebius:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Euseb. l. 10. c. 4</note> his words are these, <hi>Absolu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> &amp; post omnia Sancto San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum,</hi> viz. <hi>Altari in medio constituto.</hi> Out of these words the Vicar must know how the <hi>Altar</hi> stood not at the upper end of the Quire, but in the middest of the Church among the people. This Church whereof <hi>Eusebius</hi> speakes, was the Church of <hi>Tyre</hi> built by <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus</hi> the Bishop there. And to this place I can give a speedy answer, by sending the Author, as he doth the Vicar, to a book which he may take himselfe bound to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:15180:41"/>
read and believe,<note place="margin">Cent. 4. c. 9. fol. 688.</note> (as some willing to be deceived do) and he shal be satisfied (the <hi>Centurists.</hi>) In this place <hi>Illyricus</hi> tels us, that <hi>Eustathius,</hi> who was <hi>Prolocutor</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Nice,</hi> and <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> was deposed in a Conventicle there, onely because hee approved the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> and opposed, and publikely repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Eusebius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and this <hi>Paulinus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and others, <hi>tanquam Arrianos,</hi> for <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> With this tale of the <hi>Centurists,</hi> I suppose the Author rests satisfied, that it is no good argument to say, the <hi>Altar</hi> stood in the midst of <hi>Arrian</hi> and <hi>Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Churches, therefore it ought so to stand in Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, or Orthodox and Christian Churches. But I will deale more favourably, and not cut him off so short; nor resolve <hi>Paulinus</hi> for an <hi>Arrian</hi> upon their informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I wish the Author could say as much, to quit some of the <hi>Centurists</hi> of <hi>Arrianisme,</hi> as may be said in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of <hi>Paulinus</hi> in that respect. If <hi>Paulinus</hi> before the decree of the Councel of <hi>Nice,</hi> did leane to <hi>Arrius,</hi> (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> appeares not but by the report of <hi>Arrius,</hi> who may lie;) yet after the Councell had determined against him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Arrius,</hi> nor any of his friends, embarke <hi>Paulinus</hi> in that frantick ship: but the Prolocutor himselfe, and <hi>Athanasius</hi> affirme, that all the Bishops (<hi>Theonas,</hi> and <hi>Secundus</hi> excepted) assented to the determination of that Councell, and condemned <hi>Arrius,</hi> whether in truth and sincerity of heart, or otherwise, it is hard to say. But of <hi>Paulinus</hi> we may be fully assured, that he gave his vote sincerely: for the Preacher, who made the Sermon at the Dedication of that Church, acknowledged our <hi>Saviour Iesus Christ</hi> to be the naturall and only Son of God, and God Himselfe, <hi>and to be the Creator, and not a Creature</hi> (as the <hi>Arrian</hi> Councell at <hi>Ariminum</hi> resolved) and made him equall in honour with God the Father.<note place="margin">S.

This truth, tending altogether to the confutation of <hi>Arrius,</hi> the Preacher might have forborne to deliver in that presence, if it had not sorted well enough with his Lord <hi>Paulinꝰ.</hi> But if we may give as much credit to <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylus</hi> a privat man, speaking of <hi>Illyricus</hi> a private man, (as some yeeld <hi>Illyricus</hi> against the testimony and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of all ancient Fathers, in more things than one) then was <hi>Illyricus</hi> in his opinion no better than a <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian.</hi> For <hi>hunc inter alia renovasse Arrii doctrinam,</hi>

All that the Preacher in <hi>Eusebius</hi> sayes is this; that when all the parts of the Church were finished, then the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> or holy <hi>Altar</hi> was set in the midst: not in the middest of the body of the Church among the people, that crosseth all antiquity, and is supplyed by a friendly hand to the Author: but as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop <hi>Iewell</hi> points us very truly, to the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:15180:42"/>
in the midst, that is, in the midst of the Presbytery it was set. And in reference to the Presbytery it may well be said to stand in the midst, though not in the very Centre of the Presbytery, but removed a good distance from it, and placed at the upper end of the Quire. Thus <hi>Ioshuah</hi> sayes of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi>

            <p>But were this granted, that the <hi>Altar</hi> stood in the midst of the Church of <hi>Tyre,</hi> yet shall the Author get nothing by the hand for his purpose. The Church of <hi>Tyre,</hi> as appeares by the Preachers Sermon, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived after the patterne of the Temple built by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and after by <hi>Zorobabel.</hi> And <hi>Paulinus</hi> in his stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture endeavoured, as much as lay in him, to conforme his building to that modell, and not to come behinde <hi>Besaleel</hi> himselfe in expressing the like art and cunning in his workmanship, that the <hi>Iewes</hi> their neighbours might happily take the better liking thereof, and be sooner wonne to Christiany.

               <note place="margin">Ioseph de bel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iudaico. l. 3. c. 2</note> was thought to stand in the midst of the earth; and the Psalmist favoureth that situation, <hi>Deus operatus est salutem in medio terrae, Psal.</hi> 73.12. and that the Temple stood in the midst of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> in the midst of the Temple, and the Arke of the Testimony in the midst of the <hi>Sanctum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum.</hi> That this may better appeare, and the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity also of <hi>Paulinus</hi> his Temple thereunto; let it be remembred, that to the Temple belonged these foure distinct places, and whatsoever was done in any of these, was said to be done in <hi>medio Ecclesia.</hi> 1.

This was called the Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle of the Congregation that is among the people. <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.16. And both <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> standing there, are said to praise the Lord <hi>in medio Ecclesiae. Ps.</hi> 22.22. 3. There was the Sanctuary or Tabernacle of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, on the North side whereof stood the golden Table of <hi>Shewbread, Exod,</hi> 40.22. and on the East, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Tent of the Congregation, and the <hi>Altar,</hi> stood the Laver, and his foot made of the Womens Looking-glasses, <hi>Exod.</hi> 38.8. &amp; 40.30.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:15180:43"/>
the Temple stood in the midst of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the oracle stood <hi>in medio Domus,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 6.19. and in the midst of that stood the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and the wings of the <hi>Cherubims</hi> touched one another in the midst of the house, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 19, 27. This is the place of which the Lord saies, <hi>I will dwell in the midst of my people,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now to returne to <hi>Paulinus</hi>; As no man will say, the Oracle or Propitiatory stood in the midst of the Church among the people (for the Priests themselves were not permitted to come into it, no nor the High Priest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but once a yeare, though it stood most punctually <hi>in medio Ecclesiae</hi>;) And as no man will say that the <hi>Altar</hi> of Incense, in the Sanctuary, stood in the midst of the Church among the people; (for it was not at all lawfull for the people to come in thither; nor for the Priests, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had washt themselves at the Laver; yet what they did and spake, was said and done <hi>in medio Ecclesiae</hi>;) so may no man say, that <hi>Paulinus</hi> his <hi>Altar,</hi> made and set after that patterne, was set in the midst of the Church among the people: For as the people were excluded from the <hi>Altar</hi> of incense, (they standing without, all the time the Priest was praying, and burning incense within, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.10.) so in like manner, the <hi>Altar</hi> built by <hi>Paulinus</hi> was <hi>in medio Constituta,</hi> set in the midst, not in the midst among the people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in the midst of the holy place, which did represent the Sanctuary, from which the people were utterly excluded. But whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was done where the people stood assembled (though themselves were excluded from the very place, where it was done,) was done <hi>in medio Ecclesiae,</hi> but not in the midst of the Church among the people. The people might see the Priest going into the Sanctuary, they might heare the noise of his Bells; himselfe, his gestures, his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:15180:44"/>
actions they saw not, yet all this was done <hi>in medio Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae,</hi> but not among the people in the outward or inward Court, whereunto onely the people were permitted to come. And when <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Salomon</hi> prayed upon a Scaffold set in the midst of the Tabernacle of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, before the <hi>Altar,</hi> they were said to pray, and Praise the Lord <hi>in medio Ecclesiae,</hi> because they did it, the whole Congregation standing by, and looking on; yet properly they were seated from the midst of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple where the holy <hi>Altar</hi> stood, and the Priests mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in their Order: and that place was likewise divided by a vaile from the Oracle, which stood properly, and punctually in the midst of the Temple. So that if the Author will argue from the placing of <hi>Paulinus</hi> his <hi>Altar,</hi> that the Table must stand as that did; then he must say, that it must not stand in the midst of the Church among the people, but in the midst of the Church, or Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rather, whither the people might not come. And thus much the <hi>Vicar</hi> is given to know out of <hi>Eusebius</hi>; which if the Pen-man had beene aware of, he would have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to some newer leafe, and have let this scape, as I now doe.</p>

            <p>Now let us take a view of what can be extracted out of S. <hi>Augustines</hi> speech; <hi>Mensa illius est illa in medio posita,</hi> his Table is set in the midst. The Author would make a Novice of the <hi>Vicar,</hi> and make him believe, that the Lords Table was set in the midst of the people, that all that would might come unto it, and that hee doth invite
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:15180:45"/>
all his Hearers hand over head to come unto it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth them for their slacknesse in not comming whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they were bidden; And that <hi>Audientes</hi> had no other sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, or distinction in those times, then now it hath, <hi>viz.</hi> that all sort of people that heare Gods Word, are allowed to come, and receive the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> But the case is cleane otherwise, as may appeare by that which hath beene said. For, 1. Had these Hearers beene never so willing to come to the Lords Table, yet they could not have beene admitted, because as yet they were no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, being not Baptized. 2. Hee doth invite them to come to that Table set before them, but exhorts them to take the benefit of that Feast of Easter, (which was the appointed time for Baptisme,) and give up their names to the Bishop, that so performing the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty belonging to <hi>Competentes,</hi> they might, after the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie taken, be Baptized: And being by Baptisme made <hi>Neophyti,</hi> new plants, and true members of the Church, they might draw neere, (as it is in our Liturgy,) and take that holy Sacrament to their comfort. 3. It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by that which hath been said, <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. and 12. that the Lords Table did not stand, where every one, of what ranke soever, might see it, and be partaker thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were Baptized. Now let any man that readeth Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> and understandeth what hee readeth, say whether the <hi>Vicar</hi> could know out of St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> that Communion Tables stood in the midst of the Church, among the people, whereunto <hi>Audientes,</hi> all sort of Hearers might resort; or rather, whether the cleane contrary doth not appeare out of him, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Audientes</hi> before they were made <hi>Catechumeni</hi>; not <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> before they were <hi>Competentes</hi>; nor <hi>Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes,</hi> before they were <hi>Neophyti,</hi> and <hi>Fideles,</hi> were

allowed to approach neere unto the place where the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Altar</hi> stood; or so much as see the mysteries belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that holy Sacrament.

Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> tels you the contrary; that the people were therefore excluded with rayles, left by standing about the Priest, they might disturbe the holy Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But <hi>S.

And this Decree whereby private Masses are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, taketh place at this howre in our Church, brought hither from <hi>S. Gregory</hi> by <hi>S.

of the English, as <hi>Beda</hi> stiles him. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> useth the like phrase of compassing the <hi>Altar, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundabo Altare</hi>; yet thereby is meant no more but the humble presenting of himselfe, and his prayers, and thanksgiving to God before the <hi>Altar, Psal.</hi> 26.6. and 28, 2 for it contained too many Cubits for him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe, or fathome it round about. So if these people had come about the <hi>Altar</hi> in due manner, it could have received no other interpretation, than <hi>Davids</hi> compassing the same.</p>
            <p>Lastly, can the Author, or any man of learning ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that in this Councell the Altar did stand in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church among the people, because they went about it in such sort, as hath been said? out of his own mouth issueth the mention of the <hi>Diptychs,</hi> and out of his owne mouth is he thereby condemned. The <hi>Dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychs</hi> are not Lessons, and Chapters; it were pity this, or any learned man should beguile himselfe, and others, with such a translation. Lessons and Chapters were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed read in the body of the Church among the people, out of the Readers Pew, or Tribunall, (as Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls it) and were part of the First Service, at which the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> were present.<note place="margin">Innocent. 1. ca. 2.</note> But the reading of <hi>Diptychs</hi> was part of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.

Prius oblationes sunt commendandae ac tunc eorum nomina, quorum sunt oblationes, edicenda, ut inter Sacra mysteria nominentur.</hi> Now neither oblations, nor holy mysteries were solemnized in the body of the Church among the people, but <hi>in Sacrario,</hi> in the Holy place upon the <hi>Altar,</hi> and there were the <hi>Diptychs</hi> read. So that if the Author will hold himselfe to his <hi>Diptychs,</hi> he must say the people ran round about the <hi>Altar</hi> where it stood, and where the <hi>Diptychs</hi> were read; and that is
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:15180:51"/>
not only in the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> but in <hi>sacrario,</hi> in the most holy place of all the Chancell, and not in the body of the Church among the people, which he would make us believe, by englishing <hi>Diptychs,</hi> by Lessons and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. This I am sure is not true; for lessons, and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were taken out of the word of God. But <hi>Diptychs</hi> contained the Catalogue of Generall Councells, or of such holy, and Catholicke Bishops who had derived themselves, their Faith and Religion from the Apostles, or Apostolicke men; that faithfull men who desired (as they in the Councell of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> make profession) <hi>iter ambulare Regium,</hi> to keep the King of Heavens hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

(though the Author tell us not so) <hi>divisit populum à Clero, cum celebraretur</hi>; hee divided the people from the Clergy in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi> He saith not, he was the first, that so divided them. This is put in by the Author, and is not true. For 300. yeares and upward, before <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> was borne, even in Saint <hi>Cyprians, Tertullians</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his time, they were so divided. And, if in 300. yeares a disorder crept into the Church; he did no more than his duty, in dividing the people from the Clergy when the Sacrament was Celebrated. In the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it may bee said in time to come, that our <hi>Diocesane</hi> divided the people from the Clergy, by setting a rayle to enclose the Lords Table; yet is not he the first in these
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:15180:52"/>
latter times, that began to conforme his Diocesse to the practice of the Primitive Church in that respect. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can ages to come reason in this sort, (as this man doth) that therefore the Quire was in his time in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church: For we know this is not so.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That which <hi>Platina</hi> reporteth of <hi>Boniface</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. was about <hi>Anno.</hi> 525. The people then were divided from the Clergy; and this was about 800. yeares before <hi>Durandus</hi> could examine causes of the Priests turning about. So that if the Author allow what <hi>Platina</hi> saies, he must disallow what himselfe saies, that the Quire was in <hi>Durands</hi> time in the body of the Church. For wee are sure out of <hi>Platina,</hi> that neere 800. yeares before <hi>Durandus</hi> was borne, the people were divided from the Clergy at the Celebration of the Sacrament. Therefore in all that time the Quire was not in the body of the Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly <hi>Boniface</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. was foure yeares before the particular Synod of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> under <hi>Menna</hi> and <hi>Agapetus,</hi> and almost twenty yeares before the fifth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councell of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> under <hi>Iohn</hi> the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch, and <hi>Vigilius</hi>; which Councell this Author brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth here, to prove that the <hi>Altar</hi> stood in the body of the Church among the people; because <hi>cucurrit omnis populus circum circa Altare.</hi> Now this Author assures us out of <hi>Platina,</hi> that <hi>Boniface</hi> had divided the people from the Clergy, <hi>Anno.</hi> 525. Therefore hee must needs confute himselfe, and tell us that in the fift Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of <hi>Constantinople, Anno.</hi> 545. the <hi>Altar</hi> did not then, nor 20. yeares before, stand in the body of the Church among the people; for <hi>Boniface</hi> made a separation twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares before. <hi>Haud commodè haec divisa sunt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poribus.</hi> Wherefore if this man will examine his owne
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:15180:52"/>
Authors, (as <hi>Durandus</hi> did the cause of the Priests tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about) hee must say that the Quire was not then in the body of the Church, when <hi>Durandus</hi> lived, nor for 800. yeares before that; and when he is come so high, S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and others will lift him up so much higher, that he may looke 300. yeares further, and never finde the <hi>Altar</hi> in the body of the Church among the people, but alwayes inclosed at the upper end of the Chancell, and the people ever divided from the Clergy, <hi>cum cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braretur,</hi> as himselfe tells us out <hi>Platina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Let it be granted, that the Priest turn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th himselfe about at the <hi>Altar,</hi> and that this reason is yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the same, <hi>In medio Ecclesiae aperui os meum</hi>; doth it therefore follow, that the Priest and the <hi>Altar</hi> stood in the body of the Church among the people? Could not the Priest turne himselfe about at the <hi>Altar,</hi> and say, <hi>I opened my mouth in the midst of the Congregation,</hi> but the <hi>Altar</hi> must needs thereupon stand in the midst of the Church? When supplication, intercession, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration, and giving of thanks unto God the Father, were finished by the Priest, with his face unto the East; and the next office to be performed, being to blesse the people, is it not fit he turne him (after reverence done towards the holy <hi>Altar</hi>), and with his face into the West, blesse the Congregation of the Lord, and doe it upon this ground, <hi>aperui os in medio Ecclesiae?</hi> but this Author will conclude, that therefore the Quire stood in the body of the Church among the people. <hi>David</hi> praised God <hi>In medio ecclesiae,</hi> yet no man can from thence inferre, that he stood in the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> where the Lord appeared, and spake in the midst of the people. The Bishop, we see daily in our Cathedrall Churches, standing in his Throne, turneth his face to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:15180:53"/>
the people, and dismisseth them with the blessing, is truly said to open his mouth <hi>in medio ecclesiae</hi>; as <hi>Aaron,</hi> when he did the like at the doore of the Tabernacle of the Congregation; yet doth his Throne stand in the Quire for all that, and did never stand in the body of the Church among the people, notwithstanding his, <hi>aperuios in medio ecclesiae.</hi> If this Author would stand to <hi>Durandus</hi> his determination of this matter, he should sooner finde the people shut out of the midst of the Quire, than the Quire shut up in the midst of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, (if <hi>Ordo Romanus</hi> be considered, which <hi>Durandus</hi> examined as exactly as any man else.)</p>
            <p>So that for a conclusion, I may say of this man, as the Steward does of those that make a Feast, <hi>They keep their worst wine till the last</hi>; so hath he kept his worst arguments till the last. If that which he brings out of <hi>Eusebius, S. Austin,</hi> and the fifth Councell of <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> will not save him from perishing in this cause; it will be bootlesse to catch at <hi>Durandus,</hi> or <hi>Platina</hi> either. Let him bring in these, and they will pluck <hi>Ordo Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> after them; and then has he ordered the matter wel, in his Lettered Institutions delivered to the Vicar. For certainly, if there be good reason, that <hi>Durandus</hi> carry a hard hand against the Vicar, if he be for the Penman; it is as good reason that the Penman feele it as hard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, if he speake for the Vicar. This Milstone of a consequence the Author has whelmed upon himselfe, under which I leave him (as <hi>Durandus</hi> himselfe was once left <hi>sub lapide duro,</hi>) and how he will quit himselfe, <hi>nescio, nec ego curo.</hi> But though this mans proofes bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed of antiquity, faile him for his project in taking away of <hi>Altars, Or setting them up in the body of the Church</hi> among the people; yet he may hope of better
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:15180:53"/>
successe from the Orders, and Articles of our owne Church. True: this is indeed his endeavour, but if he have the Father for enemy, it is a desperate assay to raise a party for him of his children. But I forbeare to censure him, and take leave to follow him, and behold the issue. Thus he writeth to the Vicar.</p>

            <p>THE purpose of this Author was, doubtlesse, to astonish the poore Vicar, and to cast him into a Trance, and to take away the use of his senses, that he should not understand nor see any difference, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene having an <hi>Altar,</hi> or setting the Lords Table Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarwise (as our Diocesane, and the Governours of our Church have ordered) &amp; the bringing in of that other Oblation, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Papists offer upon their <hi>Altars.</hi> What this other Oblation is he tels us not now, nor named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. One of the twaine sure, had beene requisite for him that meant to deale clearely. Thus (whether out of ignorance, or guile) he involves himselfe, and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the poore Vicar. For the good man finds himself metamorphosed into a Papist, he knowes not how: his intention made that other <hi>oblation</hi> God knowes
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:15180:54"/>
what: The <hi>Lords Table</hi> set Altar-wise, resolved a blasphemous figment, and a pernicious imposture: and all this done against himselfe, by no body but himself, under his owne hand, when he subscribed to the 31. Article. Here is a knack of art dexterously and swiftly performed, if it would hold. But God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, that any impostor should make a man what God never made him: Though what this man fetcheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nimbly and invisibly, in a refined way of giving satisfaction and advice, blunt malice practiseth daily with downright strokes. But that the Vicar may keepe his owne shape against all practises of transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, it stands him in hand to have a double guard alwaies about him, of the holy Fathers, and blessed Martyrs of the Primitive Church, and of the learned and godly Fathers of our owne Church. Against these two, Inchanters have no power, <hi>charme they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so wisely,</hi> or rudely. The first thing then to be done for the poore mans security, against mishapening of him into a Papist, is, to shew this; That in case he had prevailed in his desire to bring in an Altar, or to set the <hi>Lords board</hi> Altar-wise, (which, thanks be to God, is now done by our Bishops direction) yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his Altar, nor oblation, nor sacrifice would have been condemned for <hi>blasphemous figments,</hi> or <hi>dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous deceits</hi>; the ancient and holy Fathers and blessed Martyrs being Iudges.</p>
            <p>I hope there is no man but will reverence the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of these Fathers, and not cast any such imputation upon them, as to say in the censorious straine of our bold Centurists, that they spake not according to the custome of the Scriptures; or that they did obscure the true doctrine and right use of the Lords Supper; or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:15180:54"/>
that by their liberty and impropriety of speech, they brought diverse inconveniencies to Gods Church. Let such boldnesse be farre from good children, to teach their fathers to speake.<note place="margin">Kemnit. fol. 775. Can. 22 de concionat. 1571.</note> 
               <hi>Kemnitius</hi> teacheth them more modesty and goodnesse: <hi>Bonae mentes plurimum moven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur consensu &amp; testimonio antiquitatis:</hi> The Fathers of our Church testifie the like reverence, not allowing any Preachers doctrine, but such as the ancient Fathers have reaped, and gathered out of holy Scripture to his hand.</p>
            <p>Let therefore the Fathers themselves speak whether <hi>Altars,</hi> and all manner of Oblations, and Sacrifices, (praises, and thanksgiving excepted) were had in such abomination, that they were esteemed blasphemous figments, and dangerous deceits.</p>

            <p>S. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> also saith,<note place="margin">S.

            <p>It appeareth by that which hath beene said, that there were <hi>Altars,</hi> and Oblations, and Sacrifices which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers allowed; and if these be used as they ought to be, and as these holy Saints of God used them, this man ought not to score them up amongst blasphemous fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and dangerous deceits, without wronging the blessed Saints of God that continually behold his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, into whose society God grant both him, and me to come.</p>
            <p>To conclude, this constant doctrine of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers concerning <hi>Altars, Oblations,</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Canons of sundry Councels. And in these also we may observe some difference made of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. There we see Sacrifices which Lay-men might offer, as Sacrifices of Praise, Prayer, Almes-deeds, and the like; and there were Sacrifices, which neither they, nor Deacons neither might offer, and such were those Sacrifices whereof the Fathers make so often mention, that are offered at the Holy <hi>Altar.</hi> Of such the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell speaketh:<note place="margin">Concil.

            <p>The words of the 31.

            <p>It appeareth then by the resolution of this learned man, that the things which the Kings Majesty and our Church condemnes, are the celebration of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist without Communicants, the selling of private Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, making a gaine of the simplicity of ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and causing them to pay more than once or twice for, fetching of soules out of Purgatory, by vertue of the sacrifices of their Masses. This practise the King accounteth the dotage of men idlely and wickedly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and rejecteth as grosse and vile abuses, and such sacrifices of Masses as these, our Church condemneth <hi>as blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceits.</hi> To which purpose we have a very godly <hi>Caveat</hi> given in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.<note place="margin">Homil. p. 1.

The du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of well-minded men concerning Altars.</head>
            <p>IT appeareth by that which hath beene said, what <hi>Altars</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices</hi> the ancient Fathers allowed; and what the most learned of our owne Church condemneth in the 31. Article. Wherefore in my poore opinion, it is not well done for an understanding, and well meaning man, and a son of the Church, to turne and wrest the Canon of our Church from the face of her enemies, and against her minde, (God knowes) to levell it at the heart of her dearest children and best friends. <hi>Priests, Sacrifices, Oblations, Altar,</hi> the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Altar</hi> is not abolished. He that will cast out these out of the Christian Church, must with them cast out <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, with diverse of Mr. <hi>Foxes</hi> Martyrs, and some acts of Parliament in force. He must cast out the most learned, holy and blessed Martyrs of the Primitive Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nay he must cast out Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the very Church it selfe, or have a Church without a Priesthood, about which <hi>Cartwright</hi> and his
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:15180:60"/>
apprentises have beene hammering their heads more than a good while.</p>
            <p>For if there be no Christian <hi>Altar,</hi> there is no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian sacrifice; if no Christian Sacrifice, there is no Christian Priest; if there be no Christian Priest, away with the Book of Ordination of Priests and Deacons, away with the Rubrick, and the Book of Common Prayer, that directeth the Priest how to officiate, away with the authority of the Prince, or Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that confirme this Booke. And doubtlesse this and no other must be the scope of him, that sayes the name of <hi>Altar</hi> is abolished: that will goe about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, that is earnest for an <hi>Altar</hi> at the upper end of the Quire, that the Table ought to stand <hi>Altarwise,</hi> that the fixing thereof in the Quire is Canonicall, that it ought not to be removed into the body of the Church, by saying, that he which should erect any such <hi>Altar,</hi> his discretion will prove the only holocaust to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed thereon, that such doings are against the 31. Article: To what purpose else is this confused blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and jumbling of these things, (which the Vicar innocently desired) with that other Oblation which the Papists were wont to offer upon their <hi>Altars,</hi> but to make the simple deluded people believe, that all these are alike blasphemous figments, and pernicious impostures? And that the Church that now is, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an utter enemy to that it was in 62. and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther departed from the Faith, and Articles of Religion then held; therefore such Priests and Priesthood ought to be cast out, and their <hi>Altars</hi> or <hi>Tables</hi> set <hi>Altarwise,</hi> and their Oblations to be had in like abomination, with that other Oblation which the Papists were wont to offer on their <hi>Altars</hi>; all which are blasphemous fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:15180:61"/>
and pernicious impostures? This pernicious purpose must in reason be in the heart of this Scribe, otherwise it was utterly impertinent to scare the poore Vicar with such terrible and astounding words. And better had it beene to have kept such mortall bolts as these in store, and not to discharge them so soone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore discretion had brought him within eye-reach of the right marke. Had this man beene so wise as the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car was, to president himselfe by what he sees done in the Kings or Bishops Houses or Chappels, he would have kept these shafts in his Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In shooting after this blinde heedlesse fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, not the judgement only and learning, but the discretion and piety of the Archer, to his Mother the Church, and to all reverend antiquity, stands in greater hazzard of the shot, than the unremarkable actions of a simple Vicar.</p>
            <p>They are not <hi>Altars</hi> (which still stand in the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of sound Protestants, and may remaine in some of ours, or to make use of their Covers, and Ornaments, Tables may bee placed in their roomes of the same length and fashion the <hi>Altars</hi> were of, (as this Author tels us) with which practise he also concurreth in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) they are not <hi>Altars,</hi> I say, or Sacrifices, or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that true Christians and good Protestants have in execration, but the grosse and vile abuses of these.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:15180:61"/>
Against abuses onely good Christians protested, and from thence received they their names.

The Protestant hath the abuses and Novelties only (which are crept into the <hi>Romane</hi> Church) in detestation, not the things themselves: no, not the name of the very Masse it selfe. For as the same Reverend Bishop telleth the Cardinall in the Kings name; <hi>In missa si missa fiunt, quae sum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Those therefore were not well advised, nor through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed of the doctrine of our Church, and of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous antiquity, that by their violent and unlearned cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours incited the people unto that horrible out-rage committed in breaking downe of <hi>Altars,</hi> and caused them to boggle and spie umbrages and scandals at the things themselves, where none at all could have beene found, if these <hi>Arietes gregis</hi> had partaken as much of the mild temper of the sheep, as they did of the Rams horne.

            <p>For as much as the most ancient and holy Fathers of the Primitive Church, and the most learned and pious Fathers of our own Church, have Christian <hi>Altars</hi> and Sacrifices in due, honourable, and reverend estimation; there is no cause at all why a man not bigge with selfe love, nor made to kindle a faction, <hi>quae jam plus satis ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescit,</hi> should picke a quarrell first with them, then with their name, then with their comming in, by phrasing it so contemptuously in that terme of <hi>creeping,</hi> whereby is implyed their comming into the Church in some base,

But the case yee see is quite otherwise, they honour, reverence, and adore towards it, for his sake whose Sacrament is Consecrated thereon; And this is the first man that I can find, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But if <hi>Altars</hi> crept into the Church, I would but know how he and I came in. I will begin with my selfe. I had my Ordination from Bishop <hi>Dove:</hi> he had his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration from Archbishop <hi>Whitguift,</hi> and the Archbishop his from the undoubted successors of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and of our Saviour Christ: Here is no <hi>creeping</hi> in all this. And I perswade my selfe he crept not into his, if he had orders in the Church of England. If the Porter or Sexton had led him aside in the night into the Belfrey, and had put what belongs to his custody into his hand, and so he had stole up to the Chancell, this had beene <hi>Creeping.</hi> But Priests in our Church have their Ordination usually at the 4. <hi>tempora,</hi> they prepare or ought to prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with Fasting and Prayer three dayes before: and at the Ordination they kneel upon their knees before the holy <hi>Altar.</hi> The Bishop and they pray before the holy <hi>Altar,</hi> then is given imposition of hands before the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Altar,</hi> then the Bishop taketh the holy Gospels from
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:15180:65"/>
the holy <hi>Altar,</hi> and delivereth the same into the hands of him that is ordained, who maketh solemne prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station before Almighty God, meekely kneeling still upon his knees before the holy <hi>Altar,</hi> and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Bishop and the whole Congregation, that hee will read these holy bookes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here is no <hi>cree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi>; but this holy action is solemnely performed, and done openly before all <hi>Israel,</hi> and before this Sunne. But if the <hi>Altar</hi> had crept in, then the Bishop had crept in much more, (for no Bishop was enthronized before his <hi>Altar</hi> was Consecrated) and if the Bishop crept in, then I am sure, hee himselfe crept in; and if he crept in, the Sextons might doe well to shew him the way out. For without the Church militant, and triumphant; in earth, and in heaven, <hi>shall bee dogges, and whosoever ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, or telleth lyes.</hi> And with untruth this saying (that <hi>Altars crept into the Church</hi>) hath more affinity than I could wish, and more than all the water in his Well can wash off, if hee make not ignorance his refuge, and save himselfe under the shadow of her wings. And thus much of the manner of creeping in of <hi>Altars.</hi>

            <p>There is not any one ancient Father that ever I see, who doth not derive the polity of the Christian Church, and take their patterne in laying downe the platforme thereof from Gods Church among the Iewes, as well before <hi>Moses,</hi> as after: as well in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Rites and Ceremonies, as in the internall, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and essentiall parts of Gods service; I shall take as little paines for this rich and sure commodity, as the Author did for the ruine of his cause.

For what the Patriarchs and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Iewes practised by the law of nature, or the rule of right reason, or by inspiration of Gods Spirit many hundred yeares before the Ceremoniall, or Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Law was given, are not to be ranked among Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Ceremonies, which were fulfilled in our Saviour Christ, and were by him taken away, and nailed to his Crosse. The Councell of <hi>Aquisgrane,</hi> and the Fathers whom they follow, take us out another lesson: For then making of vowes, singing of Psalmes, and spirituall Songs, keeping of Feasts, observing of Fasts, dedicating of places for Gods Worship, ordayning, and maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Priests and Deacons, as well as <hi>Altars,</hi> should all be cast out from the face of this man, and his abettors, as <hi>Moses</hi> was from the presence of <hi>Pharaoh: beware thou see my face no more:</hi> thou art crept in among us that are the sons of the Church under a Vizard made of a kind of complying with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> whose Mosaicall ceremonies we renounce.

So hath it fared with this man from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning hitherto. The higher he built his hopes upon old writers, or new, the lower is he beaten with their fall upon his head? It is found by his owne Authors, that <hi>Altars</hi> were in the Christian Church, within lesse than 200. yeares after Christ: that they did not stand in the body of the Church: that they did not creepe in: that their complying confuteth their creeping. Hitherto wee are gone already; and now comes forth a reason against the setting of the Lords Table <hi>Altarwise</hi> made of such stuffe, that if he had studyed all his life long to honour <hi>Altars</hi> in the opinion of good Christians, and to fill his owne face with shame; he could not (I thinke) find any comparable to this fulsome, and nasty conceit of a <hi>Dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser.</hi> The Country people would suppose them <hi>Dressers.</hi>

            <p>I confesse unfainedly, that this speech was so scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and offensive to me, and I perswade my selfe it

And I cannot but wonder how any man, (I will not say in holy orders, meditating on the holy <hi>Eucharist,</hi> Consecrated upon the most holy <hi>Altar,</hi> standing no otherwise than it ever did in the holy Catholicke Church,) but any man of gentle extraction, liberall education, and virtuous disposition, could have so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed, and degenerate a thought come into his mind, fitter for <hi>Epicurus,</hi> or one of <hi>Bacchus</hi> Priests, than the Priest of the living God, that remembreth with Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that by his office he standeth and ministreth in the most holy place of all others under the Cope of heaven, and mixeth himselfe in his service, with those Ministring spirits, the blessed Angels, that with bended neckes give humble attendance of their Lord, and ours, <hi>circum circa Saecrosanctum Altare.</hi> Me thinkes that livery which <hi>Tertullian</hi> bestowes upon his <hi>Psychicus,</hi> will suite this yeoman of the Dresser well enough.<note place="margin">Tertul. de Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junio adversus Psychicos pag. 781.</note>

Zealous and fervent Prayer would have quencht this, and all such fiery darts of the Devill. And herein is all our hope, that we shall take no more hurt by it, and that the Author when hee le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s what prophanenesse he may kindle in innocent mens

            </p>
            <p>But for his <hi>Dresser.</hi> Can the Author, or any man of common parts in understanding imagine, that when the most holy and blessed Patriarch, and rest of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in the fifth Councell of <hi>Constantinople</hi>; that when the Princes, and Citizens of that Imperiall City, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed lowly reverence and adoration to the holy <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi>; that when S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> sayes, that the drawing by the Curtaines, that the holy <hi>Altar</hi> may be seene, did put them in minde of the opening of Heaven; that when holy <hi>Gorgonia</hi> in <hi>S. Nazianzene,</hi> when Penitents in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> when barbarous souldiers in S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> when S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> himselfe sayes, that he could be contented <hi>immolari pro Altaribus,</hi> if his fall might make them stand: to come home to our countrey, when the Author sees the Kings most sacred Majesty, and the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lords of the most noble Order of the Garter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme most low and humble reverence to the most holy <hi>Altar,</hi> the Throne in earth of that great Lord, from whom their honour proceedeth, that these, or any of these had that unworthy conceit come into their minds, to take the holy <hi>Altar</hi> for a loathsome Dresser? or that any of these would have taken it well, that any Buffon should have vented so scurrilous and prophane ascoffe against the sacred <hi>Altar,</hi> which all these thinke worthy of all reverence, and when they have done all they can, yet still thinke they have done too little. And so I leave him to his meditations, and follow him to another reason, wherein though he argue weakely, and like himselfe, against <hi>Altars</hi> in Christian Churches, yet
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:15180:72"/>
he reasoneth so like a Divine, that a Christian may heare him with patience, which his late rude scurrility and unsavoury language was enough to banish. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason the Author hath met with for the utter cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe of <hi>Altars,</hi> stand where they will, Church or Chancell: <hi>viz.</hi> that Christ himselfe instituted this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament upon a Table, and not upon an <hi>Altar,</hi> as Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> observes, and others.</p>
            <p>I will say somewhat concerning our Saviours first institution of this holy Sacrament, and then leave M. <hi>Beza</hi> to answer what he brings out of M. <hi>Fox</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Archbishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Touching our Saviours institution, I conceive, none that reade the story, reads it and takes it, as a rule to guide the Church to the worlds end in all circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and ceremonies, to be precisely observed in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring and delivering the blessed Eucharist. For then the Sacrament must not be administred on any day, but on <hi>Maundy thursday:</hi> nor in a Church, but in a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and delivered only to twelve at a time, and those twelve not Women, but Men, and those men not Lay persons, but Priests: and those Priests receiving the same, not standing, or kneeling, or sitting, but lying, and leaning one on anothers brest, or bosome, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the same not in a morning, but at night, and not fasting, but after meat, and that meat taken at a supper, and that Supper not the first Supper, but when that Supper is ended, and the Table taken away, and they all risen up; and after all this, the deliverer must gird himselfe with a Towell, and wash the receivers feet; and this done they must all couch them downe againe, and so receive the Sacrament. These and diverse Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies are to be observed, if our Saviours manner
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:15180:72"/>
of institution be our precise patterne. Now if no man will binde the Church to observe these and the like Ceremonies, why will the Author binde us to a Table rather than to an <hi>Altar?</hi> and why will he forbid the Vicar to call it an <hi>Altar,</hi> considering that the Author tels him, that <hi>Altars</hi> stand still in some orthodoxall Churches, and may remaine in ours still, for ought he knowes to the contrary? What abomination is the name like to receive in our Church, more than in <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi> Churches, which he honoureth as orthodox? And why will he forbid the Vicar to call it an <hi>Altar,</hi> since himselfe confesseth also, that we have an <hi>Altar,</hi> in <hi>regard of participation and communion?</hi> Have we it, and may we not call it as it is? Those that have Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendents, may call them Superintendents: and those that have Lay-Elders, may call them Lay-Elders; and shall not those that have <hi>Altars,</hi> obtaine his favour to call them <hi>Altars?</hi> Our Saviours institution at a Table, doth not binde us to have such a Table as we have, but such an one as he had, much lesse doth it binde us to the name of a Table. If our Saviour had said, doe not you call it an <hi>Altar</hi>; or the Church had ordered, and said, doe not you call it an <hi>Altar,</hi> he might have had some warrant for his Injunction, <hi>Doe not you call it an Altar.</hi> But our Saviours Table doth not restraine the Church from an <hi>Altar.</hi> An <hi>Altar</hi> we have, or the <hi>Lords Table</hi> set Altarwise, which is all one, and an <hi>Altar</hi> we may call it, his peremptory imperatives notwithstanding.</p>
            <p>The truth is this, the purpose of our Saviour Christ in his first institution of this holy Sacrament, was not to make his example our patterne in the circumstances of a Table, Times, Communicants, or the like. But when he departed, he gave his holy Spirit to his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:15180:73"/>
and to the holy Catholike Church, which is the pillar and ground of truth; and to the Church are we to resort, to heare the Church, to be guided by the the Church in all matters of comelinesse, and order. Other things will I set in order, when I come, sayes S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and in setting things in order, he crost the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der used by Christ, for he forbad them to take their Suppers before.

But let M. <hi>Beza</hi> answer the Authors authority, who concludes plainly out of <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus, Non sedebant, sed discumbebant,</hi> they did not sit at Table, but lye downe on Couches, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.20. and shewes the manner how they lay, in such sort, <hi>ut proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, quasi in priorem recumberet,</hi> that one lay upon his next fellow, <hi>Pedibus exterius repositis,</hi> with their feet layd outward, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.21.

For our Saviours plaine meaning in those words is, (as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe tels us) to fulfill the Scripture, and the words of <hi>David; He that sitteth at table with me, or eateth my bread, hath lift up his heele at me.</hi> This was not the principall scope of our Saviour Christ, to point us to a Table, as if without a joyned Table the Scripture could not have beene performed; but to signifie a place, where he and his familiars ate friendly together, one whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him, as <hi>Achitophel</hi> sought to betray <hi>David.</hi>

Now if the Author will tye the <hi>Vicar</hi> to a Table, and such a Table as our Saviour did administer his Supper at, and imagine that if he but bring him to a Table, there must be no kneeling then, which was used before <hi>Altars:</hi> but thinke that then the <hi>Vicar</hi> will be glad for his owne ease to bring a forme with him, to sit downe, and herein satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the longings of his brethren, whom no hunger drives to that Table, if state and ease be not provided for, he is utterly beside his cushion. For the <hi>Vicar</hi> led by this mans owne authority, must have such a Table, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did institute this Supper on: but Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> will tell him for his comfort, that that Table was no Table indeed, but in name only, or not a Table framed of wood, as he hath fancyed, and imployed the judicious Church-Wardens to provide; but it was the very plain floore, and nothing else, upon which they spread their skinnes, or clothes, and when all was made ready, then they lay down one in anothers lap. And now that Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> hath deprived the Author of his hopes of a Table; he will
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:15180:75"/>
bee glad, I believe, to catch hold on the hornes of the <hi>Altar</hi> for his safety, after his opposing the practise of our Church, and of our Diocesane, and of all pious anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and bee glad to say, not only as hee doth already, that wee have an <hi>Altar</hi> in regard of Participation, and communion granted to us, but tacke about for other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations also, if hee bee well put to it. I am sure hee will come off with for an <hi>Altar</hi> for Sanctuary and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and for oblation to offer thankes to God, that he that writes in this sort to controle present authority, and reverend antiquity, may scape with the biting of a flea, with the refutation of a poore <hi>Vicar.</hi> I believe also he will imbrace an <hi>Altar</hi> for vowes, that if he may thus come off, hee will be lesse peremptory in his commands hereafter, to say to the <hi>Vicar; Doe not you call it an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar: doe not you set the Table Altarwise, that your discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prove not the only Holocaust:</hi> but be glad to call it so himselfe in moe respects than one, or two: and not to affront the whole Church of God with his judgment, but seeke to reconcile his judgement to his opinion. And if the <hi>Vicar</hi> have his consent in <hi>opinion for setting the Lords Table</hi> in the highest place of the Quire, his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may not lead him down to the body of the <hi>Church,</hi> and there set it Tablewise, and choose to disquiet the whole Church, rather than to trouble the poore Towne of <hi>Grantham:</hi> who ought to have beene taught other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, than to take offence or Vmbrage at the practice of the Primitive Church, and the direction of our Bishop. For, as we were lately given to understand by our Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Diocesane, it was ordered in most Diocesses of this kingdome; that the Lords Table should bee inclosed, and set Altarwise, as we conceive it is in his owne Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. So farre was he, and the other Governours of our
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:15180:75"/>
Church from supposing, that the Country people would take them for <hi>Dressers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is one battering blow for a farewell lent <hi>Altars,</hi> or the Lords Table set Altarwise, out of <hi>Iohn Seton,</hi> or <hi>Peter Ramus,</hi> choose you whither, and that is this. The Lords Table must not in any hand stand Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarwise, <hi>sublato enim relativo formali, manet absolutum, &amp; materiale tantum.</hi> The Sacrifice therefore which relates to an <hi>Altar</hi> being taken away, the <hi>Altar</hi> is thereupon demolished, his name at least stands forfeited to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and now no more <hi>Altars,</hi> but Tables of stone, or timber. If this be a good and Scholler-like argument, then God be with the Lords Table too, so soone as the Communion is ended, and the Lords service finished, and the Priest, and people departed: For questionlesse <hi>relativum formale tollitur</hi> according to this mans owne declaration. For the use of an <hi>Altar</hi> is to Sacrifice upon, and the use of a Table is to eate upon; So that when the eating is done, hee will not deny but the formall refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is vanished; and the accidentall forme, or materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all essence onely remaineth. Then may you make the Lords Table a board for mony Changers, or a Chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping blocke, or a tressell to lay the Beer upon, as I have seene it used, or a Glas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ers board, and the Chancell his work-house, or an out room to lay up old rotten timber, and vile luggage.</p>
            <p>But I believe, when the Bishop or his officers come to question such matters as these, they will not be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered with Axioms out of <hi>Seton</hi> or <hi>Keckerman</hi> either, or take such metaphysicall coyne for good pay: but the offendors wil be glad to turne over a new leafe, and be made to see, that Canons Ecclesiasticall will make their Canons Logicall to flie: And that their acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:15180:76"/>
relations will not stand them in any absolute, and substantiall stead. For in those things that are dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and consecrated to God by the Bishop, or made Gods by vow, and oblation from his children, are his at all times, though they be not used at all times, nor scarce used at any time, as he allowes, and as those that vowed or dedicated them intended. As for example, in Tythes, and offerings, you may not alienate them, or take them away, except you will adde a fift part, and put a better in the roome; the Councell of <hi>Aquis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grane,</hi> and the Fathers whom they follow, will teach you that for good Divinity under the Gospell, aswell as it was under the Law Leviticall. For this law is founded upon nature and right reason. There is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that any man should take away anothers right, much lesse the Lords right, or his Priests right. The things then that are Gods, whether they be <hi>Altars</hi> or Tables, and things dedicated and consecrated upon them much more, as Tythes, and oblations, whether they be used, or not used, or used otherwise by those to whom in right they do belong; as if a Priest should use his tythes and maintenance belonging to the Church,<note place="margin">Concil.

mind; the good old workmen whom he affects, cannot easily shape him to this new cut, nor can it come into the mind of any pious and godly man, except he be prompted to it by this serviceable Logician, that the <hi>Relativam formale</hi> is <hi>sublatum:</hi> and the <hi>materiale</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remaines, which is all his brethren hawke after. And this is the fowle he puts into their hands in an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, cleanly, and thrifty way. The plot of setting up Lecturers in every good towne to worke this designe, is a chargeable, slow, and somtimes an uncertain way, and proves to be but a dull device of a foggie braine, and willing blunderer, that light upon it in a mist, wherein the brethren were at first involved, who truly meant well to their cause, but mist of his mark intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But let this Logicians nimble device be received, &amp; but one such Logick Lecturer be set up in a Diocesse, the work is done. All the rest may take their ease. For thus it is in a word. Sacrifices are taken away, which is <hi>relativum formale,</hi> and therefore <hi>Altars</hi> must needs be taken away, and nothing remaine but what is <hi>materiale tantum,</hi> tables of wood or stone, without any reference at all to the things they belonged unto. So in the same manner, <hi>tolluntur Sacerdotes, tolluntur ergo &amp; Sacerdota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia:</hi> Priests are taken away, therefore all reference that tythes and other maintenance belonging to Priests had, is taken away, and that which remaines is <hi>materiale tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> corne, or hay, or a fat Pig, and these having their cognizance pluckt off, and nothing remaining but their <hi>Materiale tantum,</hi> which they owe to the soile of some Landlord, whose should they be in true and legall right but his? So that now the kind patron that has an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of Meale to give his Priest, need not run both his hands over with birdlime, and then take it up, and give
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:15180:77"/>
it freely, for all is his, the whole <hi>materiall</hi> is his. The <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lativum formale</hi> fled, when the Priest was banished, and the Evangelicall Minister came in. He may keepe all with a good conscience moulded out of a Logick Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om. May not all sacrilegious persons blesse this Man, and wish Many a good Letter like this may he write, for this Letter is there writ, the cheapest, and gainful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest that ever was procured. Herewith they can seize upon all revenewes belonging to Priests, and in the end, if need be, arrest Heaven. Happy men, by thy boone, that hast done thus much for them.</p>
            <p>But shall I ring you another peale. Wretched Man that thou art! thou makest this people to trust in a lye. <hi>Thy Wine is of the Vine of Sodome,</hi> thy clusters are bitter: thou pleasest them with Apples of <hi>Sodome,</hi> and feedest them with ashes: thou leadest them by crooked paths, and the way of truth thou hast not made knowne unto them. Be not deceived, God will not be mocked, nor stript of his owne by a Logick Axiom, which I leave to the Moderator of Sophisters to canvasse, as nothing appertaining to this cause. The ground and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Church and Churchmen build upon for the revenues belonging to God, and to those that serve at his Altar, is laid upon a Rock Christ Iesus. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is, or was given, devoted, consecrated, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him, is his and his Priests, and he that takes away, or secretly with <hi>Achan</hi> purloines but a Priests garment, call them Babilonish garments if you will, or but a peece of gold, nay, but a shooe-latchet, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hath trespassed, and is become execrable in the sight of God, and doubtlesse his sin will finde him out. And there is not a sacrilegiously-disposed wretch in this Kingdome, but knowes or may know, that those coales
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:15180:77"/>
which their predecessors in that vice have stollen from Gods Altars, hath burnt the houses of most of them, and turned them to ashes, and layd them on ruinous heaps. And those that goe by and aske, why hath the Lord done thus to these noble and renowned houses, can receive no other answer, but that they have taken the houses of God in possession, and therefore God hath performed his word, and made them like unto a wheele, and turned them topsie turvey, so that there remaines not a stone upon a stone which is not cast downe.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let not the sound of that Logick Axiom mis-understood or mis-applyed, be heard in the eares, or taken into approbation of any good Christian. The Sacrifices which Papists offered upon their <hi>Altars,</hi> are taken away, and therefore <hi>Altars</hi> themselves, by taking away of <hi>Relativum formale,</hi> are also taken away, and nothing remaines, but <hi>materiale tantum,</hi> wood or stone, therefore doe not you call them any more <hi>Altars,</hi> saith he to the Vicar. O good Sir, remember, the abuse of a good thing, is not, nor ever was, or can be the <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum formale</hi> of a good matter. The Sacrifices of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists were abuses, and were not the <hi>formale relativum</hi> of <hi>Altars.</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> tels you, that the use of <hi>Altars</hi> is to sanctifie the Eucharist upon, and that without an <hi>Altar</hi> it cannot be consecrated, and that therefore Hereticks have no Sacraments among them, because they have no <hi>Altars.</hi> The consecration of the holy Eucharist by Gods owne Priests, who for this purpose doe, or did daily <hi>Assistere Altari,</hi> wait at his <hi>Altar,</hi> is rather the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lativum formale,</hi> than any thing else, this is not taken away (God be blessed for it) when the Sacrifices that Papists offered upon their <hi>Altars</hi> were taken away, and therefore <hi>Altars</hi> are not taken away. Therefore doe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:15180:78"/>
not you open a doore to let in all profanenesse and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, by forbidding Gods people to speake like the people of God, and by reading such a Logick Lecture as will assuredly (if it should be learned, which God forbid) undoe all the people of God, in the ruine of their <hi>Altars,</hi> Priests, and Churches.</p>
            <p>To conclude; For as much as God hath put into the hearts of the Governours of our Church, to restore the Lords Table to his ancient and true place it had in the Primitive Church, and also to the honour, and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which of right belongs unto it in regard of the presence of our Saviour, whose Chaire of State it is upon Earth, and to inclose it with Rayles, not only to keepe it at all times from all manner of profanation, but also (if it might be) to strike the minds of all beholders with some reverence and respect to keepe their true di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and to make a difference betweene place and place, person and person, holy and profane, that their preparations and dispositions may be suitable. Let no man then that hath the feare of God before his eyes, to whom God hath given wit, elocution, learning, place in Church or Common wealth, lend the Devill and his Imps, sacrilegious or factious persons, the service and use of these, to disturbe so holy and godly a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and so fully conformable to the beauty and awfull Majesty that the houses of God were in in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church.</p>

            <p>If a decree come from <hi>Augustus Caesar,</hi> that all the world shall be taxed, and if <hi>Tiberius</hi> after him, and their successors, Princes and Monarchs shall require taxes, and tollages, Carts and cariages, aydes, and subsidies of their subjects in never so gracious a manner for the necessary support of the Common-wealth, the Crowne and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; though this power doe belong to Monarchs, and that the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Iudah,</hi> from the first to the last, and all Emperours and Kings, heathen and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an exercised, and practised the same, and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> to prove himselfe, (as <hi>Theophylact</hi> sayes) to be no <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean,</hi>

            <p>Our Saviour Christ allowes of what is appointed by the edict of a heathen Prince, and setled only by right of Prerogative, and prescription, without requiring to have the same maintained <hi>rationibus cogentibus.</hi> And so
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:15180:80"/>
ought this author to doe, or destroy GODS Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>But I beseech you, consider what large, and spacious floud-gates this man sets wide open to let in a whole deluge of confusion, impiety and sacriledge into the Church, if the contents of his Letter in this particular, might obtaine, <hi>viz.</hi> that the constitutions, orders, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees appointed by Canon, or received by tradition of holy Church, be not of absolute authority, and require full obedience, but are to be scanned, and disputed, and not allowed, or received before they be maintained <hi>rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onibus cogentibus</hi>; You shall neither say nor read the Apostles Creed, much lesse the <hi>Nicene,</hi> and <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolitan</hi> Creed: for <hi>Arrius, Eutichus, Nestorius,</hi> and an 100.

            <p>Thus in three words this man hath laid a plot, in case it should be apprehended, and concealed from the Bishop of the Dioces and his Officers, to do more hurt than all his Predecessors did or could doe. For all our old dotards could not devise such an exquisite engine, to undoe Church and Common-wealth, as our acute and witty <hi>Dedalus</hi> hath found out. <hi>Cartwright</hi> with his heavie Volumes, <hi>Martin</hi> with his virulent tongue, <hi>Wigginton</hi> and <hi>Hacket</hi> with their extraordinary spirit, <hi>Dorrell</hi> with his miraculous power of possessing, dispos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:15180:82"/>
and repossessing, and trouncing of Devils up and downe, and those odde fellowes in a corner, with their spirit of prophesie, could never fetch about that which this man hath light on. All these did but set their mouth, and fill their cheeks with winde to blow out the light of the Moone, which so long as the Sunne lasteth, they will never be able to do. Some of these were divided one against another, <hi>Manasses</hi> against <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> against <hi>Manasses,</hi> and both agreed against <hi>Iudah.</hi> One allowes not the crosse, but the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice he esteemes as a fooles coat, so can be content to weare it, since it is the Kings pleasure to have it so. An other casts out that rag of Antichrist, but submits to the Crosse, as better agreeing with his disposition. An other passes not upon these, but his knees may not buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle to <hi>Baal,</hi> nor kneele at the Communion. An other having his back shored up with his seat, will stand at the Gospell, but it stands not with his ease in that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture to bow his knee at the name of IESVS. But this man allowes all, practiseth all this, and is so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne, and propitious to the Vicar as to approve his doings in all these. And sayes, <hi>It is well done, that you affect decency and comelinesse in officiating of Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, and that you doe the reverence appointed by the Canon to that blessed Name of IESVS.</hi> All this while the Vicar stands much beholden to him for his kinde approbation. Marry hee had need take heed, that he kill him not with his kindnesse. For there is a So or two: two or three limitations, which the Vicar must looke to observe, otherwise he loseth his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and exposeth himselfe to so much danger, as may be imagined in a Counterfeits censure. And if he avoide his censure, and win his approbation, he looseth
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:15180:82"/>
himselfe, and the cause of holy Church. He liketh well the reverence done to the Name of IESVS, so it be done humbly, and not affectedly; to procure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and not derision of the Parishioners, and so he doe not maintaine it <hi>rationibus non cogentibus.</hi> You will say, is not this very faire and plausible? Yes marry is it Sir; therefore I pray you tell me, whether it be in the Vicars power to hinder the Parishioners, that they shall not say that that is done affectedly, which he doth most humbly: or that which he heartily intendeth to move devotion, shall not move derision, both in the better, and worser sort of the Parishioners. Of the better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there will bee no great doubt, but they will bee apt enough to deride him, of whom (if this feigned Letter were to be regarded) they have complayned already as to a Diocesan. And the Vicar can looke for small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe against their derision, if the stroke were in such a mans hands, as the Author hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eigned himselfe to be, in regard that he findes him to commend some of them for discreet and modest men, who have complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against the poore man for doing well, as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himselfe confesseth, namely in presidenting him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>selfe in setting the Lords Table, with the forme in his Majesties Chappels, and the Quires of Cathedrall Churches.</p>
            <p>Those that will complaine of him for this, and goe away with his commendation and approbation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and have the Table setled (if this forged Letter were of any proofe) after their wils, and contrary to the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars good and approved desires, are not in all likelihood to receive a check for their derision and scorne cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the good man. The Vicar then sees by this time in what case he is. For if he do reverence to the Name
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:15180:83"/>
of IESVS, as he ought to doe, and they deride him, and complaine of him, what will become of the man trow ye? He must utterly forbeare to use any reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Name of IESVS, and conforme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe therein to this discreet and modest Alderman and his brethren; or be laught out of the Church for doing the same, as by Canon he is appoined: I pray you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tell me, whether this personating person had not said enough in this <hi>So</hi> of his, to keepe the Vicar that he should never doe the reverence appointed by Canon to that blessed Name of IESVS, if he must doe it with this hazard. Exposed he is to derision: to derision of his enemies: enemies that have appeared against him: enemies fleshed, countenanced, and graced against him: excluded also from all hope of reliefe. And now that he has set him in this crampe, he bids him doe his reverence on Gods name, as law appoints. Either he must be a profane <hi>Esau</hi> and flat Schismatick, and not do it, or be made a Holocaust indeed, a Confessor, or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr if he do it. Had this man railed against the Canon, and the makers thereof, in odious and ribald-like termes with <hi>Martin,</hi> or disputed against it with <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> with spitefull and venomous reasons, he could not have frustrated the execution thereof so speedily, and effectually, as he hath here done, with his artificiall and plausible dandling of the poore man, approving, commending, and bidding him do it: but in such a sort, that if he do it, he shall be sure to bring an old house on his head, for observing an old popish antiquated <hi>Canon.</hi> If there be laughing, jeering, and derision in the Church, and that raised in the judgement of the discreet, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest Alderman and his brethren, by reason of the <hi>Vicars</hi> bowing affectedly at the name of IESVS, I pray you
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:15180:83"/>
what will be come of the man? had not he a faire war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning given him? and see, he would not looke to it. The <hi>Item</hi> was seasonable Doe it: So, you do it not affectedly to procure derision of the Parishioners: And now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here are the best of the Parish make a generall complaint against you, that you have done it affectedly, and procured much derision. <hi>I see there are offences and Vmbrages taken by the Towne against you,</hi> whereof I gave you a timely caveat when I spake with you last; and that which I did not then suspect, is now come to passe. <hi>The Alderman, whom I have knowne this</hi> 17. <hi>or</hi> 18. <hi>yeares to bee a discreet, and modest man, and farre from any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Innovation, together with the better sort of the Towne, have complained against you.</hi> What is now to bee done? bad enough with the <hi>Vicar,</hi> I feare me; but that all this is but done in perspective, without realities: The Penman of the Letter would but let you see a device of his phansie. So I leave the <hi>Vicar</hi> but in a phantasticall danger.</p>
            <p>But what I pray you will become of the Church, if this lettered mans device should Cotton and take reall effect? For though he doe but play in counterfeiting his Ordinary, yet he playes as the Cat doth with the Mouse, for in the end he intends to ruine her, and to be the death of all her Canons. If the <hi>Centurion,</hi> or a meaner man, even this Penman himselfe say to his servant, goe, hee goeth, or bid him doe this, hee doth it. But the case is not so with the Church; her decrees constitutions, and Canons must be scanned, and disputed upon before any obedience bee yeelded them. Shee like a Mother com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and of right expects Obedience immediately from her sonnes. She saies ye shall all bowe, both Priest, and people at the blessed Name of <hi>Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:15180:84"/>But this man thinkes fit to demurre upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his mother and before he will performe, it or be a meanes (if his place require it) to exact obedience in others, he will have the matter disputed on, and dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before the good men of a Corporation. And then the disputer must use no inartificiall arguments, and say the Church so appoints; this perfit artificer, and <hi>Peter Ramus</hi> will not allow of that So; but he must first of all maintaine the decree of the Church with arguments, and reasons, and those must bee forcible too <hi>rationibus cogentibus</hi>; or else no bargaine: and that is as much in <hi>Vicars</hi> power, or any mans else, to force the approbation of his reasons upon wilfull, and dis-affected persons, as it is to avoyd the derision of his gestures.</p>
            <p>In the meane time the Authority of the Church stands at a weake stay, if the <hi>Vicar</hi> must lend his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to proppe it up with his <hi>rationibus cogentibus,</hi> that it reele not on his head; And it would be a merry world with the men of every good Towne, if they might bee allowed to piert upon the Canons of the Church, and crow over her authority, and bring her to the question before the common Councell, to know of CHRISTS Spouse, as they did of Christ Himselfe, <hi>by what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity doest thou these things</hi> (to make us bow at the Name of IESVS) and who gave thee this authority within our incorporation? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saies indeed, <hi>every knee shall bow,</hi> &amp;c. But we among our selves have concluded, that that place <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. is meant of the knees of the soule. What shall the <hi>Vicar</hi> doe in this case with his <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus cogentibus?</hi> If hee tell them the ancient Fathers expound it of the knees of the body, as well as of the knees of the soule, or of spirits, or divels: and that according to the plaine Text of Scripture, and doctrine
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:15180:84"/>
of antiquity, the Church hath ordered that the knees of your body shall bow, as well as the knees of your soule to that IESVS that is a Saviour of the body, as well as of the soule, this is new doctrine to them. Therefore now there is no remedy, but to take him along with them into <hi>Mars-street,</hi> and after they have benched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves say, <hi>May we not know what this new doctrine, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou speakest, is? for thou bringest certaine strange things to our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But thankes be to God, there is not a Corporation in this kingdome, I perswade my selfe, but hath more grace, piety, discretion, and good government, than to lend an eare to such idle <hi>Dreamers,</hi> that (as Saint <hi>Iude</hi> saies) <hi>defile the flesh,</hi>

They therefore in their discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and wisedome, will thinke fit in matters of the Church to guide themselves by what they see done in the Kings Majesties Chapels, and in Cathedral, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, and to order themselves humbly, and piously, according to the godly, and holesome Canons and constitutions of their Mother the Church; that so from her, and her Governours, and from the Kings most sacred Majesty, they may, to their comfort and commendation, receive the commendation of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, and discreet men, and such as are farre from any humour of Innovation: and let this subtile Innovator, with his popular devices, goe by, who with <hi>Iudas</hi> of

               <hi>Galile,</hi> and boasting <hi>Theudas</hi> seekes, with faigned words, and deceitfull speeches, to beguile simple, and well mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning soules, and to draw much people after him. But by reading of the holy Scriptures, which now (GOD be praised for it) almost every one with <hi>Timothy</hi> knowes of a childe, they understand what befell such seducers, and their followers, and therefore they have no list, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in piety or reason to follow them,<note place="margin">

            <p>To conclude; I desire to make any sober man, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with common reason, my judge, whether he would thinke that, the Lords Archbishops and Bishops, and the whole Convocation house, men of singular wisedome, piety and learning, (as their yeares, breeding, and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gives them,) should bee at so much trouble, and charge to sit so long together, to consider of the state of the Church, and to consult with the Kings Majesty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the same, as by the words in his Majesties Writ may appeare, and then to devise and frame Canons and lawes usefull, and necessary for the good, pious, and peaceable Government thereof, and that the Kings Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty also, according to his supreme power in all causes Ecclesiasticall as well as temporall, should give his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all assent under the broad seale of his kingdom for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of them, as all Princes, and Monarchs have done in the first sixe generall Councels; if after all this is done, all such their Lawes, and Canons so made, and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, should be turned into Tennis Balls for <hi>Vicars,</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and Parishioners to tosse, and bandy up and down, and question at their pleasure, and not to have them exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, nor allowed, before they be maintained <hi>rationibus cogentibus?</hi> I believe otherwise, but that I leave to whom it concernes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:15180:85"/>There is one thing more which I cannot choose but touch upon this Author for. For mee thinkes that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty and discretion, which he commended in the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Grantham,</hi> he hath not reserved for our commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in himselfe. For thus he twitteth the <hi>Vicar; The Communion, you (out of the Booke of fast</hi> 1. <hi>of the King) are pleased to call Second Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In my poore opinion, modesty and discretion might have taught him to have forborne such petulant lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Surely the man could not but know, but that the booke of Fast was not compiled, nor ordered to be read publikely in every Congregation, without the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, nor without his Majesties gracious directions, and royall Confirmation thereof; and if the <hi>Vicar</hi> having such au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for his warrant, doe call the <hi>Communion the second Service,</hi> me thinkes in common discretion, and ordinary civility, he ought not to have a Ieere cast upon him, by a bettter man, than this Secretary can bee: for the refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the jest and scorne <hi>(you are pleased) transcends the</hi> Vicars <hi>head quite and cleane,</hi> and strikes hie, and aloft upon the toppes of hills and mountaines, from whom hee may bee taught to learne to keepe better distance.</p>
            <p>Well, the <hi>Vicar</hi> is pleased, having so good authority, to call it the <hi>Second Service:</hi> but this man is not pleased. Truly I cannot but pitty the <hi>Vicar,</hi> that has met with a man so hard to please. When the poore man did presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent himselfe in his actions, <hi>and setting the Lords Table Altarwise, by the Kings Chappell, and Quires in Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dralls,</hi> the man is not pleased, hee will upon Vmbrages have it ordered otherwise, if this feigned Letter deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any credite: when the <hi>Vicar</hi> performes the reverence appointed by Canon to that blessed Name of <hi>Iesus</hi> he is
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:15180:86"/>
pleased, So it bee done So and So, with such limitations, and hedgings, and inclosures, as the canon never allowed or thought on, except it meant to build with one hand, and pull down with another: otherwise he is not pleased. Now he does but conforme his speech to such language, as he heares used by the chiefest and most eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage in all our Cathedrall Churches, and by the Kings Majesty, our supreme Governours in all things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in any wise appertaining to matters of the Church, whether they bee Rites or Ceremonies, words, or actions, and yet he is not pleased. He wil have his <hi>Vicar</hi> neither doe, nor so much as speak as they doe, but he will be displeased, and lend him a smart jerke for so doing.</p>
            <p>What, trow you, has put the mans mouth so out of taste, that he can in no sort rellish what was done by the Archbishop that then was, and what he did by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties authority that now is: <hi>whom God of his infinite mercy long preserve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I hope he hath more learning, than to conceive the</hi> Second Service <hi>to be a new thing, and so to be ashamed of the name.</hi> For besides the Liturgies of Saint <hi>Basil</hi> and Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi> and others used in the Greeke Church, and those that have beene used at all times in the Westerne Churches, wherein he sees with his eyes, both the First and Second Service distinct one from another: He may also observe the use hereof in the Primitive Church, if he please to consult with Saint <hi>Iustin Martyr, Tertullian, Origen,</hi> Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> Saint <hi>Augustine:</hi> or read a Councell, which hee will not deny but hee is bound to read,<note place="margin">Concil.
