         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOR Right or Wrong, ſo we Call all. Not that we Believe they will be ſo, but becauſe we would have them ſo. For when a Man hath been at no ſmall Paine (at leaſt as he thinks) for the Benefit of Others, he is very prone to expect, as his due, a Return of Ki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dneſs or Candour: But on the other Hand, He, who is at the trouble to Peruſe, takes it to be his Privilege to Judge; and ſo far he judgeth rigbt, if he proceed not further, thinking he cannot be a Judge, unleſs he be malicious; And that the Buſineſs of Reading a Book is to find or make more Faults then there is, not to make an honeſt Advantage of what may be found uſeful. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Score, he that Adventures on the Preſs, brings Himſelf like a Bear to a Stake, where though he may Fancy he Creates Others great Diverſion, yet He himſelf is ſure to be the Sufferer, and becomes liable to be Baited at every ones pleaſure. But be it as it will, I have wrote my Thoughts freely, and I Envy no Man the ſame freedom of ſpeaking his: Only I could wiſh all Men would Conſider, That ſometimes Men run down-Hill faſter, then is for their own Convenience, and that Liberty loſeth its Nature, when it degenerates into Licentiouſneſs, or becomes a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs: I will not waſte time in fruitleſs Apologies; For if this ſmall Tract hath nothing in it ſelf to Buoy it up, it muſt certainly Sink; for it is not all the Daubing and Flattery in the World, that will Perſwade Honeſt, Sober or Judicious Men, to embrace Senſeleſs Impertinence: And as for Others I deſire not the Scandal of their good Opinion.</p>
            <p>If this little thing ſhould be any whit taken Notice of in the World, I know it will be bitterly Objected, That I ſeem inclineable to the Exerciſe of a more ſevere Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, then hath (at leaſt of late) been Exerciſed amongſt us, or then this looſe Age will bear, in which perhaps there is too much Truth. But I could wiſh the Reader would ſuſpend his Cenſure, till he hath Conſidered theſe few things I ſhall Return in Anſwer. Firſt, that in an Age wherein all Men are Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe in this I am not Singular, but have not only the Judgement of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Practice of the Primitive Church, but the Conſtitutions of our own Church on my ſide, which (to Avoid Numerous Inſtances,) is evident from the Preface be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Commination Appointed to be Read on <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday.</hi> Thirdly, that the more ungrateful it may be to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n-governable tempers. So much the more neceſſary it is for the Safety and Peace of the Church, and perhaps alſo of the State. For, for want of this all things Run into Diſorder and Conſuſion, Diſcipline b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When in the late great Ferment of the Nation, <hi>Controverſial Pieces</hi> flew ſo thick about, this <hi>Firſt Part</hi> was then ready for the <hi>Preſs,</hi> but for a very Juſtifiable Reaſon then laid Aſide; Whether ever I ſhall be able to Finiſh the other <hi>Two Parts,</hi> which muſt Conſiſt of <hi>Particulars</hi> relating to the <hi>Doctrine and Government of the Church,</hi> God only knows; For in Order thereunto I muſt have Expended more Money then my mean Fortune will well bear, to purchaſe ſome Books which I have not by Me: But now by reaſon that I cannot Walk the ſame pace; which ſo many Men do, I fear I ſhall be Neceſſitated in a ſhort time to Sell thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ew Books I have, to Buy my Children Bread; And in ſuch a Condition a Man can have little Stomack, and leſs Opportunity or Leiſure to Write Controverſies. However, I think this may be ſufficient amongſt all ſober Men, to Vindicate Me from the Slanders of ſome Black Mouth'd <hi>Perſons,</hi> who Give a <hi>Reputation</hi> to the <hi>Roman Religion,</hi> by <hi>Repreſenting</hi> all us <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or (which we find by Experience is worſe) as <hi>Reputed Papiſts,</hi> or <hi>Popiſhly affected,</hi> who will not run into the ſame <hi>Exceſs of Riot</hi> with themſelves. I pray God give them more Grace and Sobriety then to proceed in ſuch Courſes, and Me more <hi>Patience</hi> under ſuch <hi>unjuſt Reproaches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But my Comfort is this, that my Share is inconſiderable in reſpect oſ my Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's, or his true Follower <hi>St Paul,</hi> who underwent the full Trial of all thoſe things, whereby he Teacheth us to Approve our Selves Miniſters of God, amongſt which I think I have ſome peculiar Intereſt in theſe, <hi>i. e. To have done it by honour and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour, by evil report and good report, as a deceiver and yet true. (2</hi> Cor. <hi>6. 8.)</hi> I never thought that Controverſies were to be written for Controverſies ſake, but rather what in us lay to put an End to them; And I ſhould not think my ſelf unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate under all the Calumnies and Sufferings in the World, if I could be in the leaſt Inſtrumental to Advance the Sincerity of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Promote the Peace of Gods Church:</hi> But if I may not be Capable of Endeavouring it to any purpoſe, I will never ceaſe to pray for it; And therein I doubt not to have the Concurrence of all good Men, whatſoever otherwiſe may be their Perſwaſions; And thus Proteſting my Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity before God, and freely leaving my ſelf to the Cenſure of all Men.</p>

SO Vehement and Implacable have been the Diviſions amongſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, Managed not only with Tongue-ſhot, Diſputations, and all manner of Calumnies and Reproaches, but even with baſe Arts, moſt bloody Wars, and barbarous and inhumane Cruelties, that it might move an Enemy of our Religion, yea, perhaps an inconſiderate Perſon amongſt our ſelves, to think, that that ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>I Come not to ſend Peace, but a Sword,</hi> (Mat. 10. 34.) was not deſigned to forewarn his true Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the Perſecutions they are to expect from the wickedneſs of others, but rather to inſtruct and animate them in Quarrels, and to live as Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throats amongſt one another; And whatever are their Pretences, yet by daily Experience we ſee, That this is too much the Practice of many, who are ſo devoted to their Factions, that they ſtartle at the Name of Peace; And we have been told of ſome, whoſe Furious Raptures have Inſpired them with ſuch a blaſphemous Impudence, as to affront God with their impious Prayers, <hi>That he would Heighten and Increaſe the Diviſions of the Church.</hi> Theſe and other ſuch like Extravagancies have moved Me in the firſt place to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Obligations to Unity Chriſtians Lye under, for if they Lye under no ſuch Obligations, it is moſt certain, That the Name of Schiſm can hardly be ſo much as a Theological Sc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Chriſtianity might make Men bethink themſelves, and abate their over-eager Propenſions, and obſtinate Adherence to their particular Parties; yet I ſhall be very brief, becauſe (unleſs it be ſome Religious Madmen, whoſe Brains are Heated with Enthuſiaſm beyond any Hope of Cure) even thoſe, who are too Active and too Guilty in promoting Diviſion, do yet upon any ſober Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe freely Acknowledge, That it is not only a good and a pleaſant thing for Brethren to dwell together in Unity, but alſo that it is a duty incumbent upon every Chriſtian in his Station, by all honeſt means to promote it, not only amongſt his own party, but with all Others, who have Given up their Names to Chriſt; And I wiſh they were as ſerious in their Practice, as they are free in their Acknowledgments, and would not amongſt themſelves Teach ſome private Tenets to Enſure their Partizans, whileſt they diſcourſe at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Rate with thoſe, whom they are too apt to Eſteem their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.</p>

And in the firſt place, If we Conſider the Nature of the Chriſtian Religion, what can be more evident, then that all its Principles and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as they are moſt inſeparably Knit together, and ſubſervient to each other, ſo they tend to Effect and Confirm the ſtrongeſt Unity amongſt the Profeſſors of it. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> beſeeching the <hi>Epheſians</hi> to <hi>Endeavor to Keep the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace,</hi> preſſeth them more particularly with this very Argument, <hi>There is</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Eph</hi> 4. 4. <hi>&amp;c.) one Body, and one Spirit, even as ye are Called in one Hope of your Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all;</hi> And in this Profeſſion we have all Engaged our ſelves to be the faithful Servants of God and of Chriſt, and therefore ought joyntly to Serve the Intereſt, and Maintain the Honour of our Gracious and common Maſter: Nay, we not only here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by become Servants, but have the Honour of being Friends of Chriſt, Adopted Sons of God, and are taken into the ſame Family and Houſhold; And of how heinous and inſufferable a Crime they are Guilty, who are troubleſome in this Family, and make Factions in this Houſhold, we may Learn from that Saying of our Saviour, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 3. 25.) <hi>If a Houſe be divided againſt it ſelf, that Houſe cannot ſtand.</hi>

But poſſibly it may deſerve our particular Conſideration, That the Holy Scriptures ſpeak of all Chriſtians as being incorporated into one Body, and that in ſuch a manner, that the Hopes of our common Salvation depends upon our being Members of that one Body. Hence in relation to our firſt Admiſſion or Inſition, we are ſaid to be <hi>all Baptized into one Body,</hi> and that <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we be Jews or Gentiles, bond or free,</hi> (1 Cor. 12. 13.) Hence alſo our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and Growth in Chriſtianity, is Attributed to that Nouriſhment, which as Members is Communicated to us by this Body, the Body it ſelf being Fitly Framed and Joyned together, by all parts drawing it from Chriſt the Head,

Hence the Church of God is ſaid <hi>to be his Body, (Col.</hi> 1. 24.) and this Church not to be many Bodies, but one, <hi>(Eph.</hi> 4. 4.) and that we might underſtand, That Salvation is not to be acquired, but by being Members of this Body; We are Taught, <hi>That Chriſt Works our Salvation by Reconciling us into one Body,</hi> (Eph. 2. 16.) And for this Reaſon the Apoſtle calls Him <hi>The Head of the Church, and the Saviour of the Body,</hi> (Eph. 5. 23.) from theſe and many other places of Scripture of the like Nature hath aroſe that common Axiom, <hi>Extra Eccleſiam non eſt Salus,</hi> Which the Ancient Fathers have upon occaſion Excellently Explicated, preſſed and proved againſt Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks; But I have no mind to make a Flouriſh with Citations in a matter ſo well known, though I wiſh it were better Heeded; Only before I paſs away, I ſhall take the boldneſs to leave theſe Remarks. 1. <hi>That all particular Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as Members of the ſame Body, are Reciprocally bound to each other, not only in the Common Offices of Juſtice, but even of Love, Kindneſs and Chriſtian Succours; So that if the Man live in</hi> England <hi>or</hi> Armenia, <hi>at</hi> Rome <hi>or</hi> Geneva, <hi>in the Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey or our own, if he be a Chriſtian, I ought to wiſh and pray for his good, and if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion be offered in no caſe to decline the Promoting the good of his Soul; And if Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will permit, of his Body and Eſtate alſo. Secondly, That Chriſts Church and his Body, being terms convertible, it muſt conſiſt not only of the Preſent, but of the paſt Ages, even of all that either have or expect Salvation by Chriſt; So that no Perſon, by any Endeavors whatſoever can in the ordinary way diely hope for Salvation, as being a Member uf this or that particular Church, otherwiſe then as that particular Church by a Succeſſion of Doctrine and Worſhip, and conſequently of Lawful Paſtors and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, (without whom ſuch Worſhip cannot be duly Performed) is united to, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied with the Catholick Church of God: for even the preſent Church diffuſed over the Face of the whole Earth, though it may be ſaid to be Catholick in reſpect of particular Churches, and of its Authority, as to the preſent living Perſons, yet in it ſelf it is not Catholick, otherwiſe then as deriving from, and united to the Church of the foregoing Ages, running up unto Chriſt their Head: Neither can any that comes after be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Catholick but as an acceſſion to the former; And this if well Weighed might be a means to make Men very ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But when he ſhould further ſee the open vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and unuſual Miſchiefs which the Diviſions in all places produce, he would ſurely Reſolve with himſelf, of all others to Fly that Religion; for when all's done, let us ſay what we can, Men will believe what we do. Mens Words and Actions are often too far aſunder; But they generally Act what they really think, and therefore moſt perſons think it ſafer (where they can) to judge of Men by their Actions rather then their Sayings, as being ſurer Indices of their Minds, and having a cloſer Correſpondence with their Hearts and Deſignes, ſo that if they ſee Chriſtians to be of a froward perverſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, they will judge no better of their Religion; So great Reaſon we may ſee had the Apoſtle to give us in Charge, <hi>to Walk in Wiſdom towards them that are without,</hi> (Col. 4. 5.) The Reſult of this Conſideration briefly amounts to thus much, That Diviſions not only produce many foul Irregularities, and inexcuſable Enormities amongſt our ſelves; but alſo miſrepreſent and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize our Religion, ſo as rather to affright others from it, then allure them to it; by which means the Practice of Chriſtians is debauched, the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Goſpel hindered, the Truth as unjuſtly as highly diſhonoured, and the whole deſign of Chriſtianity in a manner fruſtrated.

And yet there is ſtill ſomething further, and very conſiderable, to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in this Caſe; for nothing is more directly binding then a Precept; and nothing more ſtrongly binding then a Precept from him, who hath the whole Propriety in us, and abſolute Sovereignty over us. So that if the God of all Power, who hath Created us, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt, to whom he hath Given all Power, have expreſsly required this Unity, then the indiſpenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the duty on our part can be no longer a diſpute, nor can this be a doubt to any, who have but lightly peruſed the Holy Scriptures; for though it may be enough to any Conſiderate Perſon, That the whole Current of Scripture bears againſt all Diſorderlineſs, Unrulineſs and Unquietneſs; yet that our Mouths might be for ever ſtopped, the thing it ſelf is Commanded in as plain and expreſs terms, as can be deſired.

               <p n="1">I. THis Unity is a Thing that ſounds bravely in the Eares of all Perſons, and Meets with a General Applauſe and high Commendation in all Places; And indeed it cannot Receive more Praiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>p their Reſt in ſome dividing Principles, they do not fetch the Nature of Unity from the full Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Goſpel, which beſt Teach it, and the Practice of the Primitive Church which beſt Explains it, but Catching ſome Shreds of Scripture for pretence, they frame ſuch a Notion of Unity as may ſuit with their own Scheme, and rather then quit any of their darling Errours, they will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to Waſh a Blackmore white, I mean, to find out ſuch a Unity as ſhall be conſiſtent with Diviſion and Separation; But it is pity to fall out about
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34855:9"/>
Unity, and therefore leaving ſuch to their vain Imaginations, I ſhall diſcover my own Apprehenſions, wherein I think it Conſiſts: And if I fail in any part, I ſhall be highly obliged to that perſon, who ſhall bring Me to a clearer and fuller Underſtanding of its Nature; for certainly did we better underſtand what it was, we ſhould come nearer together, and better concur in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and Practice of it.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But before I can proceed, I muſt for my own Security, enter a <hi>Caveat</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pretences of extraordinary Caſes; And therefore do tell my Reader, that I ſhall limit my Diſcourſe to Gods ordinary Way and ſtanding Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, to which all Perſons ought to have Regard. I will not here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my ſelf upon what terms he may ſtand, who is faſt Lock'd in a Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, or caſt upon an uninhabited Coaſt, or made a Slave amongſt Infidels, or Lies Concealed in a Cave for fear of his Life, or any of the like Nature; I make no doubt, but that for extraordinary Caſes God hath extraordinary Mercies; but then this is not Applicable to what is common or ordinary: There can be nothing more perverſe and unnatural, then to judge of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Caſe of Things by the Exceptions from it; Or to Confound the common Condition of Mankind with that, which is rarely and only at ſome times the ſad Misfortune of ſome few; And it is not poſſible to Gueſs, whither thoſe Mens Errours will lead them, who in ſtead of obſerving what are the Exceptions from a General Rule, do frame to themſelves a General Rule from exempt Caſes, and ſo overthrow the common Standard; And I muſt Confeſs, that I have not been a little ſcandalized, to find this very thing done in a great Meaſure, by Men otherwiſe of Eminence, Learning and Piety.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Now though this Chriſtian Unity be a Harmony of many parts, many of which muſt concur to make it true, and all ought to meet to make it Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat; The firſt Bond in this Common Tye, or that from whence it takes its firſt Riſe and Beginning, is <hi>that Faith which was once delivered to the Saints;</hi> And he that doth unfeignedly embrace it, is ſo far forth united both to all thoſe, whoever heretofore received it; And all thoſe, who now live in Profeſſion of it; but yet we muſt go a great way further, or elſe we ſhall come ſhort Home.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. For though this Unity principally relates to the Catholick Church of God, Comprehending all Ages and places, which is that Body, whereof Chriſt is the Saviour, and to whom the great and precious Promiſes are primarily made; yet if we would ſpeak rather uſefully then magnificently, we are not ſo much to Conſider in this Caſe the Church we are united to, as the means whereby we are united to it, and therefore as Men on Earth we are to conſider our ſelves <hi>in ſtatu viatorum,</hi> as Men that are not only bound to believe, but to profeſs the Faith of Chriſt Crucified, (for our Bleſſed Saviour hath told us, <hi>That if we be Aſhamed of Him and his Words, He will be Aſhamed of us, when He</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:34855:10"/>
                  <hi>cometh into the Glory of his Father,</hi> Mark 8. 38.) as Men ſo indiſpenſeably bound to that Profeſſion, that they muſt not only hazard, but even Actually loſe all that is near and dear to them, rather then depart from it, (for the ſame Chriſt hath told us, <hi>That if a Man come to him, and hate not Father and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Brethren, and Siſters, yea, and his own Life alſo, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be his Diſciple,</hi> Luke 24. 26.) as Men, who are bound to embody in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fraternity and Society, that they may joyntly as well as openly make this Profeſſion, <hi>not forſaking the Aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is,</hi> (as the Apoſtle teacheth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25.) In a word, ſeeing we here live in expectation of the Promiſes, we muſt ſubmit to all the termes and conditions of the Covenant, upon which God hath made their Performance to depend; And being the whole tenure of the Goſpel, doth oblige us on Earth to joyn in a viſible Fraternity, to a viſible Profeſſion, to particular duties to viſible Profeſſors, and to a real not imaginary Obedience to them, who Rule over us and Watch for our Souls; I ſee not how we can Challenge the Name of Chriſtians, whileſt we caſt off all Care of theſe Duties. And hence it is Apparent, That we cannot be United to that great Catholick, Myſtical and Inviſible Church of God, but by becoming Members of his viſible Church on Earth, as being that part of his Church, wherein he hath placed, and to which the greateſt part of our Duties do particularly Relate. To Arrive to the ſtate of Glorified Saints and Angels, that Church without Spot or Wrinkle is our Hope and Endeavour; But whileſt we are on Earth, we are only on our Way towards it, and are particularly of that part of Gods Church, wherein grow Tares as well as Wheat, to be diſtinguiſhed and ſeparated in Gods good time: And by our faithful ſincere Obedience in this, we do through Chriſt Jeſus Require and Preſerve a Right and Title in time, to be made the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Members of the other.</p>
               <p n="5">V. This being our preſent ſtate and condition, our Unity ought certainly to be agreeable and ſuitable to it, and therefore muſt be viſible amongſt the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Profeſſoms of the Goſpel; and what that is, or wherein it conſiſts, is my preſent Buſineſs to deſcribe: But firſt from the foregoing Premiſſes I would make this Inference, That a Believer at large is only a Chriſtian in <hi>Fieri,</hi> his Faith alone without the other Duties and Accompliſhments, which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel preſcribes to all Chriſtians, is not ſufficient to give him the full Title of a Chriſtian; 'Tis true, he hath laid a good Foundation, but unleſs he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to build thereon, he can no more be ſaid to be a Chriſtian, then an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer can be ſaid to have Erected a fair Houſe, when he hath only laid the Ground-Work; And the Reaſon is plain, becauſe Faith in its own Nature doth not only incline, but oblige to Obedience; And I therefore not only more chearfully Obey Gods Commands, becauſe I believe Him faithful who hath promiſed, but I muſt condemn my ſelf as utterly inexcuſable, if I diſobey
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34855:10"/>
Him at the ſame time, that I pretend to believe in Him. Hence it is obſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, That the word Faith taken Objectively, is often in Scripture-phraſe uſed to Signifie not only Revealed Truths, but Precepts of Life, even the whole Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus, or the Law of Faith; And where it ſpeaks diſtinctly of it, yet it will have the other to follow it, Commanding us <hi>to add to our Faith Vertue,</hi> (2. Pet. 1. 5.) <hi>And to Shew our Faith by our Works</hi> (Jam. 2. 8.) And accordingly the firſt Converts to Chriſtianity, upon their Owning the Faith, thought themſelves Obliged to go on to what the Law of Faith Required. Thus the Eunuch, when Convinced by <hi>Philip,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt was the Son of God, doth not Acquieſce in that Faith, but proceeds as far as his preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances would permit, and of his own Accord beſpeaks <hi>Philip, See, here is Water, what doth hinder me to be Baptized?</hi> (Acts 8. 36.) And conſonantly, hereto it is Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, That the primitive Church did Vouchſafe the Title of <hi>Fideles</hi> to no Adult Perſons, but ſuch as were in full Communion; And did Men perſwade themſelves that their Faith did ſo indiſpenſeably oblige them to all Chriſtian Duties, that without their ſincere Endeavour even Faith it ſelf became defective, it would make a fair Advance towards Unity; And till they do ſo, I ſee no Reaſon to hope for it.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. But now to Return to the thing in Hand, As we are Men on Earth, and Probationers for Heaven, our Unity muſt be ſuch as is Required by this our ſtate, and conſequently muſt conſiſt in ſuch matters as Unites all the viſible Profeſſors of the Goſpel into ſuch a Body or Society, which God hath inſtituted and deſigned for his Worſhip on Earth; But then we are to Conſider, That as we are United to the Catholick inviſible Church of God, by being United to his viſible Catholick Church on Earth, ſo we are United to this viſible Catholick Church, by being United to ſome true part of it, or by becoming Members of ſome particular Church; for no Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber can be United to the Body all over, or to the whole immediately, but is United to the Body by being United to it in ſome part, <hi>For the Body is not one Member, but many,</hi> (1 Cor. 12. 14.) And as theſe fitly Framed alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make the whole, ſo by Vertue of this Union each Member hath a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the Whole. and is both capacitated to diſcharge his Duty to the Whole, and to Receive Supplies from, and claim an Intereſt in the Whole.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Now, being that our Belief in the Son of God, and that he is the Head of the Body his Church, (if conſidered Antecedently to, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately from other Chriſtian Duties) doth rather capacitate us to become Chriſtians, then denominate us ſo, it will follow, That to have the beneſit of our Belief, we muſt take care to be Admitted into that Body, which it qualifies us to be Members of. Now in all manner of Societies, of what Nature ſoever, Members are Admitted by ſome Signal Ceremony, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34855:11"/>
known Form of Proceedings, that thereby they may be known to Others to be Members of that Society, and may undiſturbedly do the Exerciſes and enjoy the Priviledges of that Society. Now this Formal Way of Admiſſion into the Chriſtian Body or Society, is by the Sacrament of Baptiſm; And that even by our Saviours own Command and Inſtitution; for when they are ſo well Inſtructed as to believe, he will have them Received by being Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized; <hi>Go ye,</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 19.) <hi>Teach all Nations, Baptizing them in the Name, &amp;c.</hi> And though Unbelief alone be ſufficient to put a Man into a ſtate of Condemnation; yet Belief alone without Baptiſm doth not ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily put a Man into the ſtate of Salvation. This is our Saviours own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>(Mark</hi> 16. 16.) <hi>He that Believeth and is Baptized, ſhall be ſaved; And he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> And the Reaſon is plain; for though Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, as rejecting the Covenant of Grace, and its Author, is alone able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude us ſrom all benefit of it; yet Belief, though it lay hold on the Covenant, is not able alone to ſecure to us the benefits of it, if conſidered abſtractedly and ſeparately from the other neceſſary Conditions of it; for he that expects the benefit of a part, muſt obſerve not one, but all the neceſſary termes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it; from hence it may appear, how neceſſary it is, that we be all Partakers of that one Baptiſm; And this Conſideration ought to Alarm thoſe Perſons to examine well the Grounds whereon they proceed, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from all other Chriſtians, making it the ſingular part of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to deny Baptiſm, even to the Children of Chriſtian Parents, for though God is not bound up to withhold his Mercy, where the default is not in the Perſons themſelves; yet we have no certain Rule to aſſure us, that he will afford ſuch Mercy out of the way, that he hath preſcribed; but it is purely in his good pleaſure; And if Baptiſm be ordinarily the Way of Admiſſion and Entrance into that Body, whereof Chriſt is the Saviour; then ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by denying them Baptiſm, do what in them lies to damn them, which doubtleſs is a very unchriſtian part. And though it be true in relation to Perſons out of the Covenant, that they muſt firſt be qualified not only with an actual but a profeſſed Faith, without which they are not capable of Admiſſion; yet in reference to Perſons in Covenant the Caſe is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, for the Covenant is not to them alone, but to their Seed; And the Childre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But I will proſecute this no ſurther, my buſineſs being rather with Adult Perſons then Children. For though their Salvation is by being of the Body, yet they have ſmall Infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

VIII. The Parts of our Chriſtian Unity are ſo cloſe Knit together, that they ſeem to Lead Us by the Hand from the one to the other; ſo that it may ſeem ſomewhat a wonder how Perſons ſhould for the Generality be ſo wofully miſtaken about them; For having thus laid the Foundation of Faith, and being Actually Admitted by the Sacrament of Baptiſm, it will (I ſuppoſe) be eaſily Agreed on all Hands, That Perſons are not only Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Priviledges and Benefits of the Society, but come under an Obligation to obſerve the Laws and do the Duties of the Society; for no Society whatſoever, whether Sacred or Civil, ever admitted any to their Priviledges, without Tying them up to their Rules; 'Tis true, that in ſome Societies there are certain Honorary or Titular Members; but it is indeed only a Title: For where they are excepted from duty, they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from benefit: But this is peculiar to the Chriſtian Religion, that it admits none ſuch; but whoever doth become a Member profeſſing it, muſt fall under an Obligation to perform the Duties it requires; And by this we may perceive what further Progreſs our Chriſtian Unity muſt make; for we muſt be United in the Conſent, Profeſſion and Practice of all thoſe things, which according to our ſeveral ſtations in that Society the Laws of Chriſtianity do require from us. Now theſe may have relation either to particular Chriſtians, or to them as embodied in particular Societies, or to them conſidered under the Notion of Subjects and Governours; Or laftly, to the Duty and Behaviour of Governours towards each other.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Every particular Chriſtian is bound to the Sincere and conſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Exerciſe of all thoſe Chriſtian Duties, which the Goſpel requires of every one in their ſingle Capacities, as Humility, Sobriety, Temperance, Patience, and the like; And their Concurrence in, and due Obſervance of theſe things, is not only very profitable and Comfortable to Themſelves, but very Honourable to their Society; But above all we are Commanded <hi>to Put on Charity,</hi> (Col. 3. 14.) and that not only for this Reaſon, that it Virtually conteins, and in its own Nature directs and provokes to the Practice of all other Chriſtian Duties, on which Account the Apoſtle in the following words ſtiles it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but alſo becauſe our Saviour himſelf hath made it the Character and Badge of his Followers. For (ſaith he, <hi>John</hi> 13. 35.) <hi>By this ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have Love one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">X. But here it is to be Conſidered, that theſe Vertues of particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have been, and may be ſo fairly Copied out, and handſomely Exerciſed by Heathens and Unbelievers, that to outward Appearance the one cannot be diſtinguiſhed from the other; And though the Vertues of Chriſtians are really diſtinguiſhable from the like in Heathens from their Principles and Ends, yet theſe Principles and Ends are things in themſelves not ſeen; And
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34855:12"/>
therefore that thoſe Vertues may appear to proceed from ſuch Chriſtian Principles and Ends, they muſt be practiſed in Conjunction with ſuch other Duties, as do apparently Teſtifie what Principles we own; And that Charity it ſelf may be a Mark of Chriſts Diſciples, it muſt carry them on to thoſe Exerciſes, which he hath Commanded his Worſhippers to joyn in. Now this cannot be done only by ſeparate well living, but by joyning in that Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Chriſtian Communion, which the Laws of Chriſt, and the Nature of that Church or Society he hath Inſtituted, doth Require; And in theſe we do moſt clearly own and profeſs our ſelves Chriſtians, and viſibly unite in the Body; And from hence it will follow, that all Chriſtians, under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of excluding themſelves from this Body, are bound to joyn in all the publick Offices of the Church, and to bear their part in all Acts and Duties of Chriſtian Communion, and therefore Attendance to Ordinances is not only the benefit, but the neceſſary duty of every Chriſtian; And as Members of the Society they muſt do their parts, joyning in the publick Prayers, Praiſes. Thankſgivings, Confeſſions, and the like; And eſpecially ought to be careful to be duely partakers of the Lords Supper, as being that Act whereby of all others, we are moſt ſtrongly, firmly and cloſely anited both to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hriſt our Head, and to each other. Hence it is by way of Eminence, ſometimes called, <hi>The Communion;</hi> And hence it is, That amongſt the primitive Chriſtians, though a Man had openly profeſſed the Chriſtian Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had been admitted by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, was not only an Auditor, but does Communicate in the Prayers of the Church, yet they did not Account him compleatly a Chriſtian, till he did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Lords Table; And there is the ſame Reaſon for this ſtill, and perhaps greater Reaſon now then ever to urge it, when the moſt weighty Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are moſt neglected, and People are ſo apt to ſet up their Reſt far ſhort of what our bleſſed Saviour hath made their Duties.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. That this Communion is maintained by Communicating with that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chriſtian Church, being neither Heretical nor Schiſmatical, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e every Chriſtian lives, ſeems to me out of doubt; For if he do not Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate there, it is not poſſible he ſhould actually Communicate any where elſe, and therefore whatſoever Preparations of Mind may be pretended, the wilful or careleſs neglect of this, ſeems to Amount to no leſs then a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation or Undervaluing of all Communion, which ſtrikes at the very Heart of the Chriſtian Religion. But yet for all this our Communion in that particular Church is Communion with the whole, whereof that is a part, by which we are United to the whole, in which we expreſs our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the whole, and by which we draw Supplies from the whole; For our Communion in particular Churches Ariſes from the Neceſſity of our Natures, and the Condition of Humane Beings, which are not capable of Communicating with the whole altogether, but only by parts: And
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34855:12"/>
though particular Churches in reſpect of particular Chriſtians, and the Offices and Authority therein Exerciſed are truly called Churches, yet in reſpect of the Catholick Church they are but Members, whereby we are United to the whole, and Communicate with the whole; Both the Name and Benefit of Chriſtianity comes to us from joyning in Communion with that Church, which is Chriſts Body: And that is the Catholick Church, and it is to that we deſire to be United, and in that to Communicate by joyning with ſome true part of it, which is all our Natures allow us to do, and in Act can Compaſs; But if any Man Unite himſelf to, or joyn in Communion with any particular Church, either in oppoſition to all others, or without any relation or obligation to any other Church; As to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Communion, he muſt ſuppoſe that particular Church to be that Body, whereof Chriſt is the Head and Saviour, or elſe he cannot Hope for Salvation in it and then (unleſs he have the Impudence to affirm, that there is no other true Church of God) he muſt make Chriſt have more Bodies then one, and in the immediate conſequence overthrow an Article of our Creed, which acknowledgeth but One Catholick Church. Our Communion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though in a particular, yet by means thereof is both in and with the Catholick Church; And hence it is, that the Members of particular Churches, have an equal Right all the World over to Communion in all other Chriſtian Churches; And when they come to other Churches, are then actually bound to Communicate with them; Upon this Ground it was, that the primitive Chriſtians proceeded; for though they did debarr Strangers from Communion, till they did produce their Communicatory Letters or Credentials, whereby it might appear, that they lived in ſome particular Church of Catholick Communion, (that they might not be impoſed upon by Hereticks and Schiſmaticks) yet when the Church they came to was ſatisfied in that particular, they were not only acknowledged to have the ſame right with their own Members, but alſo to lie under the ſame Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; And if very ſatisfactory Reaſons were not given of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, if they did not then actually Communicate they were Treated as Schiſmaticks, ſo that that Schiſmatical Diſtinction of ſuch an Occaſional Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as leaves Men at liberty where and when to Communicate, and that even in ſeparate and oppoſite Communions, was altogether unknown to the primitive Church, or if it had been ſtarted, would never have heen en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. From what hath been ſaid it may Appear, That in the Practical No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Unity, Uniformity and Communion, are words much of the ſame Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; The two latter only more clearly Explaining the Nature and Manner of the former; And if it be true, that our Unity conſiſts in our Communion in the Solemn Acts of Worſhip, and publick Offices and Duties
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34855:13"/>
the Chriſtian Church, it will then unavoidably follow, that we muſt be U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, and firmly adhere to the True and Lawful Paſtors of the Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom thoſe Offices cannot be Lawfully diſcharged, and for want of whoſe Support and Miniſtry the Solemn Worſhip and daily Sacrifice would fail; And the greater Reaſon have all Chriſtians to take Heed to this good Order of Men; both becauſe our Saviour hath Inveſted them with his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo far forth as is neceſſary for the Officiating in, and Governing of his Church, and alſo becauſe he hath made them a ſpecial Promiſe of his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the diſcharge of their Offices: in Relation to the firſt he thus Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionates his Diſciples, <hi>As my Father hath ſent Me, even ſo ſend I You,</hi> (John 20. 21.) In Reſpect to the latter he hath ſaid, <hi>I am with you alway, even unto the End of the World,</hi> (Matt 28. 20.) So that if not under the Law, much leſs under the Goſpel may any Man take this Honour to himſelf, but he that is Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

This Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of theirs is indeed of a ſpiritual Nature; They have no power of Coeroion, they cannot by force lay a Reſtraint upon any Mans Perſon; but yet their Authority is real, and in ſome ſenſe higher then theirs, who by Gods Commiſſion carry the Temporal Sword for the terrour of evil Doers, and Defence of thoſe who do well. For the ſame God who gave Authority to the Paſtors of his Church, hath Commanded the people to obey them, <hi>(Heb.</hi> 13. 17.) And doth interpret the diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34855:13"/>
who ſo often warns his diſciples <hi>to Beware of the Leaven of the Phariſces,</hi> yet Commands them to obey the ſame Men, ſo far forth as they ſatt in <hi>Moſes</hi> Chair; And doubtleſs he doth not Require leſs Obſervance of thoſe who Sit in his own Chair; And though People are very apt to begin the Quarrel here, yet methinks they ſhould be more fearful of breaking Communion with their Paſtors, if they did Conſider, That this is the Door, by which always Schiſm enters; for it is not Conceiveable how they ſhould forſake Chriſtian Communion, but by deſerting their Paſtors in their Paſtoral Office. Hence the Fathers, (eſpecially St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> then whom no man better underſtood or wrote of this Caſe upon all Occaſions) as they uſually deſcribe a particular Church by the Union of the Flock to their Paſtor, ſo they define Schiſm by a Separation from the Biſhop; Not that they meant it is no more, but that that is the Act which makes the Schiſmatick; and that by leaving his proper Biſhop, he forſakes not only the Communion of that particular Church, but of all other Churches, of whoſe Communion that Biſhop is; And Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Communion of the Catholick Church, if he be truly a Catholick Biſhop; And hence I think it may Appear, that for Maintaining Chriſtian Communion in Chriſts Body, the People muſt be United to their Paſtors, and that not only with Reſpect to Preaching the Word, publick Prayers and the Uſe of the Sacraments, but alſo with Regard to Matters of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Government, without which Order and Regular Proceedings in the Church, it cannot be upheld. Upon this Score the primitive Chriſtians were ſo Obſervant of the Rules, Orders and Cenſures of their Biſhop, That if any Man fell under the Sentence of Excommunication, they for ſo much as Related to them, vigorouſly put it in Execution, and not only would not ſuffer ſuch a One to joyn in Communion, but would not ſo much as Eat, Drink, Converſe, or ordinarily Traffick with Him; Which Practice ſeems to have had its Foundation from that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> (2 Theſ. 3. 14.) <hi>If any Man obey not our Word by this Epiſtle, Note that Man, and have no Company with him, that he may be Aſhamed.</hi> As alſo from that, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11.)) <hi>Now I have written unto you, not to keep Company, if any Man that is called a Brother be a Fornicator, or Covetous, or an Idolater, or a Railer, or a Drunkard, or an Extortioner, with ſuch an One, No, not to Eat.</hi>

But that a Firm Chriſtian Unity may be in the Church of God, it is not ſufficient, that the Flock continue in a due Subjection to, and ſteddy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with their Paſtor, unleſs the Paſtors themſelves Maintain a fair Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, and keep due Order one amongſt another, <hi>For if the Trumpet give an uncertain ſound, who ſhall Prepare himſelf to the Battel?</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 8.) how is it poſſible, that an Army ſhould be Unanimous in it ſelf, or Employ its full force againſt the Enemy, if the Commanders Agree not, but give out contrary Orders? Nor is it poſſible, That the Unity of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34855:14"/>
Church ſhould be preſerved, if the Paſtors Govern their Flocks, not in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, but Oppoſition to each other, and ſet up ſuch termes of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as other Churches cannot approve, but muſt withdraw from; It is indeed true, That every Biſhop in his particular Church, hath a kind of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Authority, and is to Govern his Flock <hi>Rationem Actûs, ſui Domino redi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turus,</hi> (as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> more then once phraſeth it,) Hence it is, That in ſome things a Chriſtian Man is bound to Obſerve the Orders of his own Church, and obey his own Biſhop, before any, if not all the Biſhops in the Chriſtian World; But then, this Authority muſt not be ſtretch'd beyond the Bounds of his own particular Church; And hence aroſe thoſe ſeveral different and often contrary Uſages and Cuſtomes in ſeveral Churches, which were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted againſt, becauſe they belonged to the Power of each particular Church, and conſiſted in ſuch things, That he that Communicated after the one Manner in one Church, might Lawfully Communicate after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in another. Of this Nature was that known different Uſage of old, between the Churches of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Millan;</hi> In the former they Faſted on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turdays, in the latter not. And therefore St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> who was truly as ſtout a Biſhop as ever the Church had, though he ſtrictly Required Obedience to the Orders of his own Church, yet at <hi>Rome</hi> was as Obſervant of theirs, and Adviſed St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Mother <hi>Monica</hi> to do the ſame. The Reaſon muſt be fetch'd from the Nature of the Things, which being indifferent in themſelves, might be Lawfully practiſed either Way, and therefore were in the Power of every Church to determine or not determine, as She found moſt for her good and Advantage; But when theſe Things are determined, Obedience put on the Nature of Duty, and Diſobedience of Sin: But though every Biſhop, in Reſpect of his particular Church or Flock, hath (according to the Old Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Language) his Throne, yet in Relation to the Catholick Church he is but a principal Member, who in Conjunction with Others of the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is to Share in care of the whole; And therefore in Matters which have an Influence on Catholick Communion, he is Accountable to his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues or Fellow Biſhops, and for any Miſdemeanour herein may by them be Suſpended, Depoſed or Cenſured, as they or a convenient part of them ſhall judge Meet, for the preſervation of the Churches Peace. And in this Caſe the Biſhops of other Churches did not only Exhort, but Require both the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Clergy and the People to Refuſe Communion with their Biſhop, though in all other Caſes the ſeparating from the Communion of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and the Erecting another Altar, or ſetting up a Conventicle againſt him, was Accounted the peculiar Signature of Schiſm. And the Reaſon is plain, for though they could not hold Communion with the Church, but by Maintaining Communion with their Biſhop, yet they did Communicate in that Church as a part of the whole; And if he did break off from the whole,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34855:14"/>
or was Injurious to the whole, if they ſhould Adhere to him therein, they muſt follow his Fate; And therefore here they might deſert him, and cleave to ſome other ſound part, and joyn in Communion Approved by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Biſhops. The Reaſon of the Biſhops abſolute Power in one reſpect, and his Subjection in another, ſeems to be briefly Couched in that ſhort Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of St. <hi>Cyprian, Epiſcopatus unus eſt, cujus à ſingulis in ſolidum par<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s tenetur. (do un,)</hi> for though he held but part of that Epiſcopacy, by which the whole Church <hi>(Concordi multorum Epiſcoporum numeroſitate)</hi> was Governed; yet holding that <hi>Parte in ſolidum,</hi> he had the full Epiſcopal Authority, and was a Catholick Biſhop, and his Orders according to their Nature ought to be Heeded by all Biſhops: But then what he held <hi>in ſolidum,</hi> being but <hi>Pars Epiſcopatûs unius,</hi> he was Bound to Exerciſe his Office in Conjunction with them, who were equal Sharers with him; And herein was Anſwerable to his Fellow-Biſhops ſor any detriment or injury done by him to their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Office and Common Charge. Hence a Biſhop was in ſome things Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious, even to the delebility and loſs of his Character, (as <hi>Spalato</hi> hath proved againſt the fond device of the Schools <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.) and was bound at his peril, not only to Preach the ſame Faith, but to Walk and Act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Cannons of the Church; And yet in other Things, his Act was ſufficient to Tye up all the Biſhops in the Chriſtian World; Both which Things are an invincible Evidence of the Senſe of Antiquity, of their Participation of the ſame Office, and of their Obligation to, and dependance upon each other in the diſcharge of it. Hence it was, that when a Biſhop was placed in any Vacant See, though he was never ſo Canonically Ordained yet he was bound to ſend abroad his Circular Epiſtles to other Biſhops, to Signifie his due Admiſſion to that great dignity, and withal to give in a Summary of his Faith, that they might Admit him to Catholick Communion, and upon occaſion might Communicate with him, and Aſſiſt him in the juſt diſcharge of his place: If he afterwards fell into Hereſie, or did any irregular Act, he was Tryable by his Peers, and might be Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured according to his demerits. On the other Hand, what wholeſome Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he made for the good of his own particular Church, thoſe, who came from any other Church thither, were bound to obſerve them; And if he juſtly put any Perſon under the Sentence of Excommunication, upon his Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying thereof with the Cauſe, all other Biſhops and all other Churches were bound to take that Perſon for Excommunicate, wherever he came, and to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him from their Communion; For in Caſes of this Nature, every Regular Act of Authority in one Church, was Regarded as the Act of the whole Church; And thus in all things particular Churches Acted in Relation to, and Communion with the Catholick, and Maintained their Unity Firm and Inviolable.</p>

XIV. My Deſign hath been to Write a Chapter, not a Treatiſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Unity, and therefore I may be excuſeable, if I have not Hit every thing; though I perſwade my ſelf, that had we theſe, the reſt would not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; But my fear is, that my Accuſation will rather Lye on the other Hand, That I have Iaid the Platform of ſuch a Unity as in all its parts is no where on Earth to be found; And though the more is the pity, yet poſſibly it is too true: But then this Objection Amounts to no more (though that, God knows, is too much) then to ſhew the deplorable ſtate of the Church, and the woful degeneracy of Chriſtians; For the Religion we profeſs Requires ſuch an Unity; And <hi>de facto</hi> it has been had and practiſed in the Church; And till it be Reſtored, I ſee little Hopes that Matters can be brought to Rights, and that they are not, they muſt Anſwer who are the true Cauſe: If any enquire, What particular Perſons in this Caſe are to do?

               </head>
               <p n="1">I. OUR Religion is ſo Unchangeable, <hi>That if an Angel from Heaven ſhould come and teach any other, then what we have already Received, he ought to be Accurſed;</hi> And therefore the nearer we come to the firſt Settlement, the ſurer we are to be in the Right; But ſome Men ſo doat on their fond Devices, and are ſo bewitched with the pleaſure of Coyning New Notions, that not content to delude themſelves, they labour all they can to perfwade others, that every thing that is old is ugly and to be Abominated. Thus that ſweet Harmony of the primitive Chriſtians, whereby they preſerved their Body Sound, againſt the Malice of Hereticks and Schiſmaticks, enjoyed free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in all Places, and were no where deſtitute of Comfortable Support and Aſſiſtance, whether Spiritual or Temporal, this (I ſay) has either been imputed to the folly of the firſt Converts, or the Tyranny of Hereticating Biſhops: But if there was any thing ill, and of Miſchievous conſequence to Religion, for this they became zealous Advocates, were ready to tell us, That the Devil is not ſo black as he is Painted, and ſo palliate the Matter, that at length they would draw it in to be uſeful. Amongſt Matters of this Nature nothing hath found more Patrons then Schiſm. Some have ſhuffled it to and fro, till they have loſt it; and ſome have Trick'd and Trimm'd, and Sett it out for ſuch a pretty harmleſs thing, as would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt tempt One to be in love with it. But being I have ſaid enough in the firſt Chapter to prove Schiſm a Sin of a deep Dye, I ſhall forbear to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt it, and Sett my Self rather to make a diſcovery of it, that the Rock appearing we may be the better able to avoid it.</p>
               <p n="2">II, Schiſm in its general Notion ſignifies any Rent, Rupture, Diviſion, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration or Solution of Continuity: But in an Eccleſiaſtical Senſe, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Church, it denotes ſome Breach or Separation among the Members or parts of that Body, growing ſo high as to cauſe Bandying into Parties, and ſetting up diſtinct and oppoſite Communions; or the like: But becauſe all Separation is not Schiſm, and that which is, is not always ſinful, therefore it may be convenient to enquire, by what means Separations are made, what Separation is Schiſm, and what Schiſm is ſinful.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Thoſe Perſons who are ſo far from any Communion in the Church, that they never did or would receive and embrace the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus, are really ſeparated and excluded from his Body the Church; But
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34855:16"/>
then in this they cannot properly be ſaid to depart from it. or make any Schiſm in it, becauſe they were never of it, nor any way Related to it. And therefore their Crime is not ſtiled Schiſm, but Infidelity; And the Perſons Infidels or Heathens, not Schiſmaticks.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Some Perſons have Profeſſed the Faith, and Lived in the Communion of the Church, but through the powerful Inſtigations of the Devil, the ſtrong temptations of Worldly Advantages, Senſe of Torments, dreadful Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Danger, or the like ill Motives, have Renounced not only the Communion of the Church, but the Faith of Chriſt; But theſe are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Schiſmaticks; for Schiſm doth import ſome Relation ſtill to the Church, though it ſuppoſe a diſorderly behaviour in it, and a Breach and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of its Peace and Unity: But theſe are wholly gone off, and their Crime is in it ſelf of a higher Nature, though many times not ſo Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous in its Effects; And it is commonly called Apoſtacy, and the Perſons Apoſtates, or in the Modern Language Renegado's,</p>
               <p n="5">V. There is a third Sort of Perſons who profeſs the Faith, and live in the Communion of the Church, but through Pride, Diſcontent, Wantonneſs, or the like Cauſes, are not careful to Attend to ſound Doctrine, but fall into Errours, and Entertain and deviſe Opinions prejudicial to the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the Salvation of Souls; But if th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now becauſe the Acts of this Unity conſiſt in Chriſtian Communion, and it cannot be otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and manifeſted but by ſuch Communion, therefore a Departure or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from that Communion muſt be that which we call Schiſm.

                  </gap>, which Signifies a Seceſſion or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. And hence it appears, That every Heat, Quarrel or Brabble, (how faulty ſoever it may otherwiſe be,) doth not Amount to Schiſm, unleſs it ſo influence the Communion as to make a breach in that; And therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Contention between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> nor that Conteſt between <hi>Polycarp</hi> and <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

had been his Auditors, nor that ſharp Conflict between the ſame <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> nor that long debate between <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Cyprian,</hi> were any of them to be Accounted or brought under the Notion of Schiſm; becauſe the Communion of the Church was ſtill kept up and Maintained by all the Parties; But when this Communion is violated and broken, then it comes to a direct and open Schiſm; And this may be done ſeveral wayes, all of them I pretend not to reach, and thoſe I ſhall mention I ſhall not dwell on.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Some there are, who forſake the Communion of the Charch, but go not ſo far as to ſet up any oppoſite Communion, not that they have any honour for, or regard to Church Communion, but that they think it unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, if not prejudicial. Theſe, though they ſeem not to Fly ſo high as others, in that they Vex not the Church with oppoſite Communions, yet they really overthrow all Communion, and deſtroy the whole publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, wherein his People are United for his glory and their own-benefit; And therefore theſe are nothing ſuch harmleſs Creatures as ſome think them; Amongſt theſe we may Reckon thoſe Rank Enthuſiaſts, who have overgrown Ordinances, and account themſelves far above all ſuch weak Helps and beggerly Elements.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. I ſhall further propoſe it as a Queſtion, whether ſome Men by their particular Opinions or Declarations may not make themſelves Schiſmaticks, even whileſt they continue in the Communion of a Church that is truly of Catholick Communion? for though the Paſtor and Officers of the Church walk never ſo Canonically, and Perform all Services with relation to, and dependance upon the Catholick Church; yet if any Member ſhall ſo awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly adhere to this particular Church, as to oppoſe it to all others, and condemn all others, and refuſe Communion with any other, he ſeems to Me to make himſelf a Schiſmatick; For though the Church be of Catholick Communion, yet he communicates in it upon Schiſmatical Principles, and makes it Schiſmatical to him. The Church indeed is in Communion with other Churches, but he communicates in it in oppoſition to other Churches; And this ſeems in ſome Meaſure to have been the Caſe of the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth; Paul,</hi> and <hi>Apollos,</hi> and <hi>Cephas</hi> were all Miniſters of the ſame Chriſt, great Maſter-Builders in his Church, and zealous Maintainers of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions; and yet ſeveral in the Communion of this Church, ſeems to have communicated upon narrower termes then the Conſtitution of it Required. For ſome were for <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſome for <hi>Apollos,</hi> and ſome for <hi>Cephas,</hi> and they that were for one were againſt the other two, and againſt all others, who did not joyn with them in the ſame quarrel. I will not ſay but that it might go higher, and that there might be oppoſite Communions; That St. <hi>Paul</hi> there Planting the Goſpel, might leave ſo many Congregations in that Church as the Number of Converts required; That <hi>Apollos</hi> coming after upon the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34855:17"/>
increaſe of Converts, might leave them more Church-Officers, and increaſe the Number of their Congregations; And the firſt might ſtand ſtiffly for <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other for <hi>Apollos:</hi> However, the firſt is not improbable, and indeed both might be true ſucceſſively; They might firſt claſh in the ſame Communion, and then break into oppoſite Communions. But this I leave to the further Conſideration and Cenſure of Others.</p>
               <p n="9">IX. Where there is ſuch a Renunciation of Communion, as to ſet up op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Communions, it may be Effected ſeveral Ways: Sometimes the Layety have forſaken their Paſtors, Congregated into Bodies, and of their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Raiſed diſtinct Communions; I will not here diſpute whether they deſerve that Name; but certainly this is the Height of Preſumption and Madneſs; for though it be true, which <hi>Corah</hi> ſaid, <hi>(Numb.</hi> 16. 3.) <hi>That all the Congregation are holy;</hi> yet the ſad Story that follows. aſſures us, That they are not therefore all Prieſts and Levites, and that they may not preſume to enter upon, and promiſcuouſly diſcharge that Sacred Office and Function. Sometimes Subject Presbyters, and other Church-Officers have forſaken their Biſhop, carried away many of the Members of his Church, and gathered Sheep from all Quarters out of the true Fold; And this is the more Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, as carrying along with it ſome Shew of Authority. Sometimes Biſhops and their Churches have Rejected the Communion of other Biſhops and their Churches; Sometimes in like manner Metropolitans have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Metrop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the Sehiſm is ever the more Miſchievous, according to the Conſiderableneſs of the Perſons concerned in it, or the Extent of their Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, or the Cauſe they divide upon. Too much of all this is in the preſent Diviſions of the Chriſtian World, which are managed with that Bitterneſs and Height, and have torn the Church ſo all-to pieces, that it is a Subject fitter for our Lamentation then Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="10">X. And yet after all it muſt be Acknowledged, that all Separation is not ſinful; for then wherever there was a Separation, they would be faulty on both Sides, as well they that made, as they that ſuffer by the Separation; Nay, if that ſhould be granted, a Man might be neceſſitated to Sin, which he never is or can be. For if unſufferable Corruptions or ſinful Uſages be brought into a Church, whereof any Perſon is a Member, and ſet up as termes of Communion; He cannot Communicate without Sin, nor can he Depart without Sin, but unavoidably muſt Split upon one of theſe two Rocks if all Separation be ſinful; And therefore to diſcover that Schiſm which is Sinful or Criminal, we maſt bring it not only a Phyſical but a Moral Conſideration. Such the Caſe may be, that the Separation may not only be lawful but neceſſary. It was Gods Command to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> concerning <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> (Jerem. 5. 45.) <hi>My People, Go ye out of thae midſt of her, and deliver ye</hi>

But being there ought to be no Separation, but upon the ſcore of Avoiding Obligations to Sin, and no further then may ſecure us in that matter, there can be no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration but there will be Sin on the one ſide or the other; And being the bare Separation may not only be lawful but duty, the Sin of Schiſm muſt Lie, where the cauſe and evil is found, and they are the Schiſmaticks who unjuſtly cauſe the Breach. And indeed ſimple Separation doth not include the whole Nature of Schiſm in an Eccl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For though thoſe, who depart from any true Church of God, as it is a part of the Catholick Church, do break off from the Body; yet thoſe, who depart upon juſt and warrantable Grounds, though they depart from the Schiſmaticks, yet they do not fo ſake the Church of God, but continue in its Communion, and are Members of that Body; and therefore cannot be Schiſmaticks: But I need not Diſcourſe this any further, becauſe (I think) it is Agreed on all Hands, that the Sin of Schiſm follows the Cauſe. Now from all that hath been ſaid, this or the like Definition of Schiſm may be Gathered, That it is an unjuſt Violation, Breach or Solution of the Unity of the Church: Or (to expreſs it more plainly) a Cauſeleſs Separation from Eccleſiaſtical Communion.</p>

Secondly, that ſuppoſing this to be otherwiſe, yet ſince the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration Matters have been decided by a General Council, <hi>(viz.</hi> That of <hi>Trent,)</hi> to which all ought to ſubmit. I ſhall Endeavor to give a fair Anſwer to both theſe Objections; But firſt muſt premiſe, That ſuppoſing, not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of either or both theſe Objections, yet of themſelves they do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

When <hi>Baſilides</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialis,</hi> two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Biſhops, juſtly depoſed, fled to <hi>Stephen</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> And

by Lyes and Flattery ſo prevailed with him, that he not only admitted them to Communion, but endeavored to reſtore them; St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſmartly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it, writes not only to the Biſhops, but even to the People there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Communion with them, Commends the Subſtituting two other Biſhops in their Room, and ſays, <hi>That the Faults of</hi> Baſilides <hi>in Endeavoring his Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution by</hi> Stephen's <hi>means, were Non tam abobita, quàm cumulata</hi> (Epiſt. 68. dd. Pam.) I could bring Inſtances enough of this kind, but this being a by-matter in this place, I will leave it and Return to the Objections.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Two Titles are ſet up the better to ſecure us; But the one is purely forged: and the other is crackt, weak and bad, and not able to ſupport the Claim which is Founded on it; It is hard to ſay, what Authority the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> doth not Challenge under the Notion of Chriſts Vicar; His Flatterers will ſcarce allow any Bounds to be Set to it, and Examine his Actions, and you will find that he Sets himſelf none, On this ſcore, not only we, but all the Chriſtian Churches in the World, which are not of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, are ſtigmatized for Schiſmaticks: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary I think, that there is no one thing that doth better Juſtify our Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, then the Challenge, and (what in him lies) Exerciſe of ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary and boundleſs Authority over all the Churches of God. Upon this Account this Matter will fall under a particular Conſideration, as one of the principal Grounds and Reaſons of our Separation; And therefore at preſent I will leave this great Vicar-General, and try if we can come to any better termes with the Weſtern Patriarch.</p>
               <p n="3">III. This latter Title, as leſs liable to Exception, hath been inſiſted upon of late by ſome, who would ſeem to be of more moderate Principles, and more tender both of the Liberty and Authority of particular Churches: nor is it to be denied, That the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had a Patriarchate in the Weſtern part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, but by what Authority he came by it, and how far it was extended, and whether he hath forfeited and juſtly fallen from it, and other Queſtions of the like Nature, will fall in of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Series of our Diſcourſe. In the mean time, I do think this Title to be ſet up at this time only as a Blind to Amuſe the more unwary and well Meaning Perſons, who are willing to ſubmit to Eccleſiaſtical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, though they deteſt all unjuſt, much more all inſolent and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Uſurpations; for if by a Charter from Chriſt he be his only Vicar, over the Univerſal Church, it is not only a Leſſening of his Holineſs, but a direct Aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ont to our Saviour, to Cope up his Deputy within Bounds, and to Give Him a limited Juriſdiction by Eccleſiaſtical Authority, when he is Inveſted with all by Original Right, and needs not any which they can Give; And it would certainly be much greater Satisfaction to the Chriſtian World, to prove his Authority to be of God, rather then Men. Beſides, I would gladly
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34855:19"/>
know, whether the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> will Acquieſce here, and Reſt Contented with the Title and Authority of the Weſtern Patriarch? For Patriarchal Authority is by Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitution, and was at firſt Suited to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the Empire, and the Grandeur of ſome principal Cities in it; And by the ſame Authority it was Given may be taken away, or placed elſewhere, as ſhall be judged moſt uſeful and beneficial to the Church of God. Now though all this may be eaſily proved, yet being applied to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> (and according to the preſent ſtate of the Queſtion, it is as applicable to him as any other Patriarch) I fear the whole College of Cardinals <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> would Cry out, <hi>Hereſie, damnable Hereſie.</hi> And therefore the ſtarting this Title at this time, I only look on as a Sly Device to let in the Cats Head, that ſhe may with greater Eaſe draw in her Body after.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. But be it as it will, without any regard to any ſuch ill Deſignes, which ſome Men may covertly Manage, let the Objection have its due force, and let us Examine, whether the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> as Weſtern Patriarch, (ſo called in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to other Patriarchates in the Empire of another Site) had any peculiar and proper Juriſdiction over the <hi>Britannick</hi> Churches, or whether they were any part of his Dioceſs, as the word in its largeſt Acception ſignifies, A Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion containing ſeveral Provinces? And this I think will be fully Anſwered: if I prove, That in Relation to the <hi>Britannick</hi> Church, either he had no ſuch Juriſdiction, or no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e by Right.</p>
               <p n="5">V. That the Government of the Church was left in the Hands of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, I ſhall prove hereafter. But for the more convenient and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous Management of the Churches Affairs, there began very early a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Deference, Reſpect and Obſervance to be paid to the Biſhop of the principal City, where the Secular Governour had his Reſidence. He at firſt was called <hi>Epiſcopus primae <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbis,</hi> or <hi>Sedis;</hi> Afterwards, a Metropolitan. But ſome overgrown Cities, whoſe Numbers, Wealth and Intereſt enabled them to overtop and oppreſs Others, as it were, Naturally Infuſed into their Biſhops a Spirit of Ambition to extend their Juriſdiction and Power, Anſwerably to the Grandeur of their City. Theſe Mens Encroachments were for a long time ſtoutly oppoſed, but Power naturally following Strength, Wealth and Intereſt, and an Advantage being given them by the New Diviſion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> they in the End prevail'd, and Graſp'd ſo large Juriſdiction as to have ſeveral Metropolitans under them, and obtained their firſt Ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> as our late Learned Biſhop of <hi>Oxford</hi> hath clearly proved. <hi>(Account of Church-Govern.)</hi> Theſe at firſt were called Exarchs, afterwards Patriarchs, and ſometimes Primates. Of this new Booty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fail, the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as Biſhop of the moſt Renowned City in the World, and the Ancient Seat of the Empire, carried away no ſmall Share; for he was always of Kin to the Lion in the Fable, who, when the Prey came to be
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34855:19"/>
divided, made the Beaſts that Hunted with him, Content with a very ſmall pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, if he was ſo gracious as to allow any thing: But yet this New Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant Power did not ſwallow up the whole Church, but in many Places they ſtill Lived in their Ancient Liberty, Governed by their Biſhops and Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans, without being ſubject to any Pratriarch; of which the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Churches are a famous Inſtance in the Eaſt, and I can yet ſee nothing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to think otherwiſe of the <hi>Britannick</hi> in the Weſt.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. Never any Succeſſion of Men have ſtood ſo conſtantly on their Guard, and have been ſo watchful, diligent and induſtrious upon all occaſions, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs others and Exalt themſelves, as the Biſhops of the <hi>Roman</hi> See: All was Fiſh that ever come to their Net; If they could at any time ſteal into a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, though never ſo unjuſtly, they would never quit it, or not without ſtrong Tugging and eternal Claiming. And therefore Conſidering this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per it were a fair Propoſal, that Setting aſide Flams and Impertinencies, they would produce any fair Footſteps of a proper Juriſdiction exerciſed by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> over the <hi>Britons,</hi> within the ſpace of a Hundred years after the Council of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> For when Men have always been ſo buſie in Acquiring, ſo tenacious in Keeping, ſo ſevere in Exerciſing Juriſdiction, and want no Records, (unleſs what themſelves have either falſifyed or abuſed); That theſe Men can produce no good Evidence for ſuch a Juriſdiction, to Me it ſeems a good Argument, that from the Beginning there was none. If bare Claims, (and thoſe coming after) were enough, no Man could live in Peace: And therefore he that will thruſt another out of poſſeſſion for his own benefit, muſt well and clearly prove his Title. Had theſe Iſlands belonged to the <hi>Roman</hi> Patriarch, there was no ſtrength in them to have kept out his Power, when it was back'd with the leaſt Shew of Right. If therefore it cannot be proved, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was in poſſeſſion of ſuch Juriſdiction, here, at or near the time that Patriarchates were ſetled, he may let his Suit fall; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he have more Hopes from force or fraud, then Right; In this Cafe, if in any, that Common Rule, <hi>Idem eſt non eſſe, &amp; non apparere,</hi> hold good; And the rather, becauſe the Canon that Confirms Patriarchates, ſuppoſeth the former Exerciſe of fuch Juriſdiction by Cuſtom. What by degrees he gained long after, may ſerve well enough to prove him an Uſurper, but can Create him no Right, as I ſhall prove Anon.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Now though it be all the Reaſon in the World, that if the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will pretend a Title, they ſhould prove it; yet I will not barely inſiſt upon Poſſeſſion on our part, without giving ſome Reaſons that may manifeſt our Right to it. If the Patriarchate of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was Confined to the Suburbicary Churches, it is moſt certain, that the <hi>Britons</hi> lay too far off to be Hook'd in by that Title; What other Evidence can be brought for the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Bounds of his Patriarchate, I cannot tell; I have met with no better:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34855:20"/>
And this having been plainly Aſſigned to him, it will concern them to bring their Proofs, who will extend it further, and therefore I will not longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on it. Yet this among other Reaſons moves me to think, that as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch he had no proper Juriſdiction either over the <hi>Gallican</hi> or <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Churches, and divers others, otherwiſe then as he might ſometimes interpoſe as an Honourary Arbitrator, or at other times upon a nicking Opportunity with the diligence of a watchful Uſurper, invade their Rights. That the <hi>French</hi> Churches came not under his Authority in the ſame way and manner, that ſome Others did, the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Churches ſo ſtoutly Maintained to this very day, are an irrefragable Inſtance; And perhaps that is almoſt the only Church of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion, which affords us any Hope, that the Cauſe may one day come to a more equal Hearing, and Matters be brought more to Rights in the Church of God. But as for our ſelves, if the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> never Exerciſed any ſuch Patriarchal Juriſdiction over the <hi>Bri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, who will Aſſert it; But if it were poſſible, that they could tell me Five Hundred Tales of Perſons ſent over hither by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> I ſhall not Value it one Ruſh. For if wherever he ſends one of an Errand, he Requires the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the place, as he hath the Privilege which never Man had; ſo if he hath not been very negligent and falſe to his own Intereſt, he might long ſince have gained the Juriſdiction of the whole World, and that is certainly too much for a Patriarch, which is our preſent diſpute. But though I am not bound to prove the Negative, yet to ſhew that he could have no ſuch Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, I ſhall produce two Arguments, the one taken from the different Rites and Uſages of the <hi>Britons</hi> from the <hi>Romans;</hi> The other from the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops downright diſclaiming ſuch Authority, and Aſſerting and Proving their Liberty.</p>

Doubtleſs it doth more Concern us to be truly thankful, that God hath Vouchſafed us the Light of his Goſpel, and to be careful to live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, then ſcrupulouſly to enquire after the preciſe time, when the <hi>Britons</hi> Received the Chriſtian Faith. But if Enquiry ſhould be made, (which in our preſent Caſe may not only be allowable but uſeful) I am prone to think it would appear, That the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Churches were ſo far from being the Slave, that they were the Elder Siſter of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> And if neither the Gift of Chriſt, nor the Canons of the Ancient Church have dealt her any hard Meaſure in this Matter, certainly the Prerogative of her Birth-right ought to inveſt Her with ſome Honour and Priviledge, at leaſt to Shield Her from

Truckling too much to the Power and Petulance of her younger Siſter: And the rather becauſe ſhe hath not been unfruitful, as having brought forth the firſt Chriſtian King, furniſhed the World with the firſt Chriſtian Emperour, afforded the firſt (call her as you pleaſe) Chriſtian Queen or Empreſs, and of all Others firſt ſo Received the Faith, that it was the publick, Allowed and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized Religion of the place, in which Reſpect ſhe hath ſometimes been Honoured with the Title of <hi>Primogenita Eccleſia;</hi> But to paſs by theſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourary Titles, it is generally Agreed, That the <hi>Britons,</hi> as in ſeveral other Matters, ſo eſpecially in the Obſervation of the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> did differ from the <hi>Romans:</hi> And to find out the true Reaſon of this, I think the beſt Way will be to look ſtill higher, even to the firſt times of Chriſtianity. Our bleſſed Saviour was ſo far from ſeparating from the Jewiſh Church, that he made them his particular Care and Charge, and ſeems to have ſo deſigned all his Labours for their Conviction and Reformation, that all Nations might have been Aggregated to them in his Name; And therefore he was generally ſhy towards Others, and being Urged with Arguments in favour of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Canaan,</hi> plainly Anſwers, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 15. 24.) <hi>I am not ſent, but unto the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael. This Honour towards the Jewiſh Church, (the only Church of God then on Earth) and Care that it might not be loſt, bat rather that the Wall of Separation being broken down, all Others might be let in to Her, continued with the Apoſtles and Diſciples of Chriſt, after his Death and Reſurrection, for they remained ſtill at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> preaching to the Jews. And when the Cruelty of <hi>Herod,</hi> and Malice of the Jews followed them ſo cloſe, that they were many of them forced to Fly out of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſave their Lives, yet their kindneſs to the Jews, and Hopes of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion ſtill ſtuck cloſe to them, in ſo much that thoſe, who were ſcattered upon the Perſecution of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and went as far as <hi>Phenice, Cyprus</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, Preached the Word to none but the Jews only,</hi> (Acts 11. 19.) And there was need of no leſs then a Miracle to perſwade <hi>Peter</hi> to go and inſtruct <hi>Cornelius</hi> a Gentile in the Way of Truth, <hi>(Acts</hi> 10.) and though he did go upon ſuch unanſwerable Motives, yet he was called to an Account for it: The going in unto Men Uncircumciſed was thought a Crime not to be ſuffered, unleſs extraordinary Reaſon could be given for it. And perhaps this Tenderneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Jews might be no ſmall cauſe of <hi>Peters</hi> Judaizing at <hi>Antioch.</hi> Now whileſt the Diſciples did Adhere ſo cloſe to the Jews, it is not only Reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that they Uſed their Cuſtomes and Rites; But we have Scripture Teſtimony of ſome Inſtances, wherein they did ſo, as in the matter of the Sabbath, (though they kept alſo the Lords Day) and Circumciſion, and ſome other things. And therefore it is likely, that they did obſerve with them their other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſts and Feaſts, eſpecially that which was Accounted the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, the Paſſeover. For as they look'd upon theſe things as in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

to be matters then indifferent, ſo tbey did hope to draw off the Jews by degrees, and to let the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> go off Honourably rather by Diſuſe then Contempt. And this Practice continued for ſome time after the Converſion of divers of the Gentiles by the Diſciples, who were diſperſed by the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> And therefore I take that Plea of <hi>Polycrates</hi> for his dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Obſervation of <hi>Eaſter</hi> from <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be a Teſtimony of the very early Converſion of thoſe <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Churches, and that they were of the Firſt fruits of Chriſtianity. But after that God, by beſtowing the Holy Ghoſt on the Gentiles, and other clear Signes and Indications of his Will, had Convinced all the Apoſtles and Miniſters of the Word, that it was not only lawful, but their Duty to make known the Words of Eternal Life unto the Gentiles, and the Gentiles upon their Preaching in all places did plentifully Flock into the Church, then in thoſe Gentile Churches Chriſtian Liberty began in a greater Meaſure to be Maintained againſt the Moſaical Rites. And now <hi>Paul,</hi> who Circumciſed <hi>Timothy,</hi> refuſed to Circumciſe <hi>Titus;</hi> yea, even the Council at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> disburthen of all thoſe Matters ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome few things, which the Neceſſity of the Times would not permit them to take off, unleſs they ſhould have utterly diſobliged the Jews, of whom they had ſome Hopes. And about this time it is probable began the ſtrict Obſervation of the Lords Day, with the Neglect of the Sabbath; And the Celebrating the Reſurrection, not on the preciſe time of the Jewiſh Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, but on the firſt day of the Week, (Called the Lords Day, from his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection on that day) next following the Fourteenth of the Moon.

And for this Reaſon amongſt Others, <hi>viz.</hi> That they might not Ground their Feſtival from any Jewiſh Rite, or becauſe they thought the Account not exact, they declined the Fourteenth of the Moon, and began that Feaſt on the Lords Day, reckoning from the Fifteenth to the One and Twentieth of the Moon. Now not to Run over the Stories of <hi>Simon Zelotes, Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea,</hi> and Others, who are Celebrated for the firſt Planters of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion in theſe Iſles: From theſe Premiſſes it is not irrational to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Churches, obſerving the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> after the Uſage which obtained before the Separation from the Jews, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church more exactly as was deviſed afterwards, the Goſpel in all probability muſt have been Preached and Received in <hi>Brittain,</hi> ſome time before any Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Church was Gathered at <hi>Rome;</hi> And being this Uſage continued for ſeveral Hundreds of Years, though the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were ſo far from ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it in, that they would ſcarce ſuffer it out of their Juriſdiction, it will follow, that theſe Churches were neither of <hi>Roman</hi> Converſion, nor <hi>Roman</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction.</p>

This Matter will be much clearer, if we now deſcend to Conſider the Debates, Behaviour and Actions of the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops towards <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk, who was ſent hither by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> for the Converſion of the <hi>Saxons.</hi> But firſt to prevent miſtakes I muſt tell you, that I have no deſign either to Vindicate the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops in the Obſervation of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the <hi>Roman;</hi> It Matters not to Me who was right or wrong; but it is the Difference and the Grounds whereon it was Maintained, which ſerves my Ends. The <hi>Britons</hi> were not <hi>Quartodecimani,</hi> as ſome have ſuppoſed; for thoſe kept the Feaſt on the Fourteenth of the Moon, on what day of the Week ſoever it fell; but the <hi>Britons</hi> expected the Lords Day.

unreaſonable that thoſe, who had no Juriſdiction over them, ſhould impoſe an Alteration upon them, and ſtill worſe to raiſe irreconcileable fewds, and make Diviſions in Gods Church for ſuch a matter; As if a Man could not be a good Chriſtian, without being an exact Aſtronomer, and Critically cunning in the Cuſtomes of other Nations.</p>

This much troubled the good Pope, who by all Circumſtances ſeems to have Set his Heart on this Work; And he had the greater Reaſon for it, becauſe it was already half done to his Hands; And therefore he gently Reproves theſe faint-hearted Souldiers, but takes greater pains to encourage them; And that they might want nothing to Fit them for the Work, he Sends and Recommends them to <hi>Etherius</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Firſt, That with a tender Care to expreſs their Communion with the Catholick Church, and their duty to all Chriſtians, they own no other Obedience to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> then as Chriſtians they owe to any other Foreign Biſhops and their Churches; And ſo the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> owed as much to Them as they to Him. Secondly, That the Authority which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> demanded, and the Power of any Foreign Biſhop to place him over them, was a thing utterly unknown and unheard of to them; ſo little were they Acquainted with the Patriarchate, which is now ſo Confidently Aſſerted. Thirdly, that they were ſo ſubject to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Caerleon,</hi> That they did not think him ſubject to the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of any other particular Biſhop whatſoever, but that he was over them next under God. And accordingly we never hear of any Appeals from him to any Superiour See; But if any thing concerned them in Common, or was too weighty for him, it was Tranſacted Synodically. And it is Obſerveable, That though the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Biſhops and Clergy Flockt to this Synod with their main ſtrength, yet the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Caerleon</hi> abſented himſelf, in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood either in indignation at <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Claim, or leſt his Appearance ſhould ſeem any ways in the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The Effects of this Synod were very unhappy, for the <hi>Britons</hi> went away ſo Enraged at <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Pride and Pretences, that they would not Afford the leaſt Aſſiſtance towards the Converſion of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> Nay, when they were Converted, it is Apparent, That they looked on them as Schiſmaticks, or worſe, and would have no Communion with them: And in this untoward Humour they perſiſted, even when the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But to Return to <hi>Laurentius;</hi> He was not only fruſtrated in his pious Defign by the <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but fell ſoon after into a great deal of trouble; For after the Death of <hi>Ethelbert</hi> Religion went backward amongſt the <hi>Saxont,</hi> the Pagan Worſhip and Wickedneſs got Ground daily, and a dreadful Storm ſeemed to grow up apace, and Hang over the Heads of the Chriſtians, in ſo much that <hi>Mellitus</hi> and <hi>Juſtus</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with their ill ſucceſs, and finding themſelves not ſafe, Retire into <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Laurentius</hi> was once Reſolv'd to follow them.

And thus he ought to have laid his Argument to make the Parallel run true to the Reality of the Caſes: But he was more Crafty then ſo, for that had been to Confute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Next, he triumphs over <hi>Fox,</hi> for ſaying, That <hi>Beda</hi> affirms this Cuſtom concerning <hi>Eaſter,</hi> to have been in <hi>Britain</hi> almoſt 1000 yeares after Chriſt: <hi>Whereas</hi> (ſaith he) Beda <hi>was a much older Author, and died in the Year</hi> 735.

(without one I know not how it could) and <hi>Beda</hi> ſhould appear almoſt 300 yeares after his Death to ſome drowſie Monk, and tell him this Tale? <hi>F. Parſons,</hi> if it had made for him would have Hugg'd ſuch a Revelation: But after all, it is only a miſtake, if not, a wilful One; though <hi>Fox</hi>'s heedleſs way of Expreſſion gave too much Occaſion for it; for his meaning is this, That <hi>Beda</hi> affirmeth <hi>Eaſter</hi> to be ſo kept by the <hi>Britons</hi> in his time, and that the ſame Cuſtom continued after his time amongſt them ſo long, as to be Practiſed almoſt 1000 yeares after Chriſts time; And all this is very true, as ſhall appear Anon.</p>
               <p n="21">XXI. To Revenge this Wrong (as he thinks) done to <hi>Beda,</hi> he falls foul upon the <hi>Magdeburgenſes,</hi> for making <hi>Jeoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmoutb</hi> to live about 700 years after Chriſt. <hi>Jeoffery</hi>'s Teſtimony indeed Gauled him ſorely, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was to be ſhuffled off by any means; Whether he hath done the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> Right in that thing, I neither know nor care. For their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour as to the time of <hi>Jeoffery</hi>'s Life doth nothing invalidate his Teſtimony. But if it were good before their miſtake, it is ſo ſtill, ſo that this is only Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing. Beſides, though <hi>Jeoffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> lived in the time of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> which is above 500 yeares ſince, and ſo is no Yeſterdays Author; yet the Work it ſelf is much older; For he was not the Author but Tranſlator of that Hiſtory, which was written Originally in the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> Language, and Accounted an Old Book before he was born, as <hi>Lambard</hi> and others have
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34855:28"/>
proved, and therefore the Teſtimony is more Conſiderable, and deſerves a better Anſwer after all the <hi>Magdeburgenſes</hi> Account, may Refer to the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Teſtimony, and Time when the thing was Tranſacted, not to <hi>Jeoffery</hi>'s Life; and then it will be too Modeſt and too favourable; To leſs purpoſe is his time ſpent in proving <hi>Jeoffery</hi> to be no Cardinal. I ſhould be prone to believe him, if I had no other Reaſon, but his Relating a Truth ſo prejudicial to the Intereſt of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> But if he was not a Cardinal, he might be as honeſt a Man; 'Tis certain he was a Biſhop, and as ſuch was a much better Man; eſpecially if the Pope would ſuffer them to be what Chriſt and his Apoſtles made them, and not Appropriate all that Authority to the <hi>Roman</hi> See, to a Share of which every Biſhop hath as good Right and Title as himſelf.</p>
               <p n="22">XXII. At length, after a deal of Shuffling, Lying and Rayling, he comes to the Matter of <hi>Jeoffery</hi>'s Teſtimony; And that he Anſwers eaſily, and ſo may any Man, who takes no Care to ſpeak Truth, but only what may ſerve his Turn; He ſays, <hi>There is not a Word in it of not Acknowledging the Pope</hi>

To Help out this, he tells us of Two more Popes, <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>John</hi> the fourth, who wrote to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> to reduce them from this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Hiſt. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 19.) it is clearly implied, that the whole Nation was involved in it, and ſo we have a Pope on our Side to ſet againſt him that follows. His Pope <hi>John</hi> was ſcarce Pope then, at Beſt he was but Elect; And the Letter ſeems to come, (as I may ſay) from the Chapter in the Vacancy of the See; and of thoſe many who joyn in Writing it. <hi>Hilarius</hi> the Arch-Presbyter, not <hi>John,</hi> is firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; but for once let <hi>John</hi> have the Credit of it, and he then will tell us, <hi>That this Hereſie</hi> (i. e. concerning <hi>Eaſter) was but lately ſprung up amongſt them, and only ſome few infected with it.</hi> But now how <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> will Agree about this, I cannot tell; For once I will be ſo kind to <hi>F.

The <hi>Brittiſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Uſage was in this Weſtern part of the World a great Singularity in thoſe days; Now if <hi>John</hi> had a Mind to draw them off from it, who can blame him from ſpeaking favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and repreſenting the Matter as inoffenſively as could be: The Way to Win Men is not to provoke them; and we ſometimes ſeem not to believe, that a Man is ſo bad as we know he is, becauſe we would not harden him with ſhame, but have a deſire to make him better.

ſtate, but by uncertain Relations; <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great himſelf, when he ſaw the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Children Sold in the Market, knew not whether their Nation was Chriſtian or Pagan. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> even for ſome time after his Coming hither, knew not the Uſage of the <hi>Britons,</hi> yea, even <hi>Laurentius</hi> his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor had much ſuch an opinion of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> as <hi>F.

               <p n="24">XXIV. But now comes the Knocking Argument to this Effect; That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Damianus,</hi> and others ſent by <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> nor St. <hi>German</hi> and his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, who came twice hither to oppoſe the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> make any mention of this Uſage, which they would have done and Amended it too, had they found it here, <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>both Pope</hi> Pius <hi>and Pope</hi> Victor <hi>had before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it for Heretical.</hi> I could thank the Jeſuite for this Argument, for it mortally Wounds his own Cauſe. I will not again diſpute the Miſſion of <hi>Damianus</hi> or <hi>Deruvianus,</hi> (or what other Names the Jeſuite will give Him,) nor will I inſiſt on it, that <hi>Germanus</hi> and <hi>Lupus</hi> were ſent by the <hi>French</hi> at the Requeſt of the <hi>Britons,</hi> and not by the Pope; But if that Uſage was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally practiſed by the <hi>Britttiſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and no good Inſtance appear, that it was ever otherwiſe, as I have already proved, and that it continued for a long time after; then it will unavoidably follow, that the <hi>Britons</hi> were not under the <hi>Roman</hi> Juriſdiction, nor thought themſelves bound to ſtand to the Popes Determination: Yea further, that theſe very Men, whom he ſaith the Pope ſent were of the ſame Mind, or elſe dealt very unfaithfully in making no ſtir about it. Nay, being the <hi>French</hi> Churches did Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate both with <hi>Brittiſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> at that time, when they not only Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this Uſage in oppoſition to <hi>Rome,</hi> but refuſed Communion with their Biſhops; It is an Argument, that they neither thought the Biſhop of <hi>Romes</hi> Decrees did bind the <hi>Britons,</hi> nor that the thing was ſo Heretical in it ſelf; For certainly they would never have ſo freely and Friendly Maintained Communion with them, had they ſtood in open oppoſition, and profeſſed diſobedience to their proper Patriarch. By this a Judgement may be made of the Reſt of <hi>F. Parſons</hi> Arguments; I ſhall follow him no further. It is not the Obſervation of <hi>Eaſter</hi> which we diſpute with <hi>Rome,</hi> but we urge the Practice of the <hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> to prove the Liberty of theſe Iſlands.</p>

                  </gap>, thoſe Ancient Cuſtomes, which they would have take place. They were ſuch, which were not only <gap reason="foreign">

And if theſe be they which muſt carry the Cauſe, I think the Churches of theſe Iſles are or ought to be as ſafe, as ever were the <hi>Cyprian.</hi> For theſe had not then ſo much as been Attempted, when the other were but a ſmall Matter from being quite Raviſhed, and had undoubtedly been ſwallowed up, had a General Councel been kept off but ſome few yeares longer. But that they might more effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Miſchiefs which Attend ſuch Encroachments, and the Detriment and Diſhonour done to Religion by them, the Holy Fathers give no leſs then three Reaſons for this their Conſtitution.

                  </gap>. That the Canons of the Fathers may not be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, it ſeems the Laws of the Church had been all along againſt it. But what of that? What are Canons to the Pope, who is ſubject to none. 'Tis pity he was not excepted: But the true Reaſon is, becauſe the Fathers thought he ought not. The <hi>Plenitudo Poteſtatis,</hi> now ſo much boaſted of, was not then thought of; Or if it was, durſt not appear abroad, leſt it ſhould have b<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

Popes themſelves in thoſe days pleaded the Canons, and were iudged by them: And this Canon hath a peculiar evil Aſpect upon him; for it is directly contrary to his declared Opinion and Determination in behalf of the Biſhop of <hi>Antioch.</hi> So that if the Popes now do not regard the Canons, it ſeems heretofore they as little regarded him. The ſecond Reaſon of the Canon is expreſſed thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That the Pride and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Secular Power may not enter the Church, under a pretence of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging the Miniſterial Function, which ſeems directly to point to that Saying of our Saviour to his Diſciples, <hi>(Matth.</hi> 20 25.

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Surely if theſe Fathers had not a Grudge at the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> they had a foreſight of his Progreſs. For put together what the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> now Acts, and what, he Claims; And if that <hi>Typhus Seculi,</hi> which the Antients all along ſo feared and bitterly inveighed againſt, be not brought into the Church by him; I will be bold to ſay, that all their Feares were Follies, and that it neither is nor ever can be brought in whileſt the World ſtands. The third Reaſon

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Leſt by degrees we loſe that Liberty, which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Redeemer of all Men hath purchaſed for us, (or beſtowed on us) with his Blood. If ſo, our Churches, in ſtead of being blamed, ought to be highly Commended for defending this Liberty: And as he, who ſhall invade it, ought at preſent to be diſcountenanced by all others, ſo it is to be feared, that he will have a ſad Account to make up in the day of the Lord Jeſus, though he pretend to be his Vicar. Now if Reaſon could prevail, here is ſufficient; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe oftentimes Men will not be Ruled by Reaſon, therefore the Fathers yet take a further Care to Compel them by Law, and determine in the ſame Canon, That <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. That if any Man ſhould produce a Conſtitution contrary to what is now determined, it ſhall be void, or of no Authority. Now if there be any Reverence for, or force in a Canon, ſo carefully penn'd, by ſo Venerable a Councel, then it is plain, That we have withdrawn no Obedience which the Pope could lawfully Claim, nor Caſt off any Authority that he was poſſeſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But when <hi>Leo</hi> heard of it at <hi>Rome,</hi> he fell a Roaring at no Rate, not that he had too little, but that the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had too much; He was in a bodily fear of ſuch a dangerous Competitour, who on a ſudden had from almoſt Nothing Riſen to ſuch Greatneſs, that he was able to Cope with Him; And by the Grandeur of his City, his Intereſt in the Clergy, and favour of the Emperour, might in a ſhort time be able to over-top Him. It is not unlikely, that <hi>Leo</hi> might think, that he could have ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled well enough for Himſelf without the Help of any ſuch Canon, and might poſſibly look on it as a Confinement.

extended over theſe Iſles; yet what Feats will this do for him? even under Patriarchates, (ſor they did not obtain in all places of the Empire) the power of Metropolitans was ſtill Reſerved; they ſtill Ordained the Biſhops of their Provinces; they did Convene and hold Provincial Synods, and determined Matters as formerly; Only whereas the Metropolitan was before Ordained in his Province by his Suffragans, now he was to be Ordained by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, or at leaſt with his Conſent, and there lay an Appeal from him and his Synod. In ſhort, the Power of a Patriarch Conſiſted in certain known Inſtances, but chiefly in Conjunction with the Biſhops of his Dioceſs or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archate. Now what a pitiful ſhrivel'd thing would the Pope think this, if it were offered him? How would he fret and ſtorm, if we ſhould thus Admit Him, and Tye his Hands behind Him? And yet as Patriarch this is all he can Claim; But to Claim that and ten times more, where he hath not ſo much as a Patriarchal Right, is ſuch a Piece of Impudence as none would be guilty of, but thoſe who can bluſh at nothing. And therefore it will be beſt not to truſt him, but hold our own as long as we can.</p>
               <p n="31">XXXI. Upon the ſame Suppoſition we may ſtill proceed further, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether a Patriarchal Power do Entitle a Man to all he can Graſp, or lay his Hands on? Are we ſo faſt bound, that there is no getting quit of Him, though he Command ſuch Matters as diſhonour God, diſturb the Church, miſlead Chriſtians out of the true Way, and does Actually Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over Mens Souls, Bodies and Eſtates? Patriarchal Authority was firſt Inſtituted for the good of the Church, that Order might be preſerved, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Religion ſecured, all Perſons contained in and held to their Duties, and Hereſies and Schiſms prevented.

That it has been and is abuſed by the Biſhop of <hi>Roms,</hi> contrary to all theſe Ends, might be fully proved by an Induction of Particulars, but that would lead Me into too large a Field; And I ſhall therefore Omit here, becauſe it will be done hereafter, when I ſhall inſiſt on thoſe particular Heads, which prove the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> guilty of the Schiſm.

And if he continue ſtubborn and obſtinate in the Right, perhaps the whole Kingdom ſhall be put under an Interdict; And ſo if your Purſes be not at the Popes ſervice, and your Perſons his Slaves, you ſhall not be ſuffered ſo much as to Worſhip God. Now is not this a fine Patriarch? And would it not be a great Sin to caſt Him off, and ſerve God whether he will or no?

the Limits of Juriſdiction in the Church followed the Diviſions of the State: Where the Governour of the Province had his Reſidence, there of courſe the Metropolitical Authority placed it ſelf, and the Biſhop of that City was he, whom the Apoſtles Canons, <hi>(Can.</hi> 35.) call the Firſt, to whom all the other Biſhops of the Province are to have ſuch a peculiar Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, that they are to Act nothing of Common Concern without his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence. And ſo after the Diviſion of the Empire into Dioceſſes, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly roſe up that Rank of Men ſince called Patriarchs. But by the way we muſt obſerve, that this did not take in all places. For in ſome Cities where the Vicars of the Empire Reſided, were not of Strength, Intereſt and Power ſufficient to Mount their Biſhops into Patriarchs. Beſides, the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the Church were exceeding jealous of this new ſtart-up Power, as ſavouring more of Worldly Pride, then Epiſcopal Care, and therefore kept it out wherever they could: And the wary <hi>African</hi> Biſhops made a Decree againſt ſo much as the Uſe of the Name; And great Reaſon they had for it, for it would be no hard Matter to prove, that by this means crept in thoſe Abuſes and Corruptions into the Church, which are now Maintained with a Pretence of Authority, and therefore the more Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dileſs. Moreover, as this new Honour was dangerous, ſo it was needleſs, for the Dioceſſes, though they ſeemed to ſwallow up, yet they did not deſtroy the Provinces; So that the Metropolitical Authority remained ſtill Suited to the Government of the State, and was much more ſafe and botter Fitted to keep out Secular Pride, Vanity and Worldly Pomp out of the Church; And though it was thought requiſite, that the Eccleſiaſtical ſhould Comply with the Civil Government, ſo far as to be uſeful in the State, yet it was never thought needful to run o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But however, if thoſe Laws of the Church, which Erected or Confirmed Metropolitical or Patriarchal Power, proceed upon this Grand Reaſon, That the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church might be Agreeable to the State, then it is Apparent, that they never did immoveably Fix ſuch Authority to any particular pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for Alteratio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

or Patriarchal Power was Erected, then thoſe very Laws themſelves, which firſt Erected it, do in their profeſſed Deſign, Reaſon and Intention, not only diſannul it, but direct the Governours of the Church to eſtabliſh or procure the Eſtabliſhment of ſuch other Limits of Juriſdiction, as may be more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory to the State, and beneficial to the Church. Indeed, all theſe Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent dignities, whereby one Biſhop was raiſed above another, were Erected either for he better Management of Affaires in the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, or for the Grandeur of it; Or elſe ſprang up by degrees for the benefit of thoſe Cities, which were of greateſt Power and Intereſt, in which thing <hi>Rome</hi> had the moſt advantage, as being the Imperial City, and giving Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the whole Empire. But now that Empire being broken, and Reſolved into ſeveral abſolute and independent Principalities, other Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ought to be taken, and for the ſame Reaſon, that ſuch Authority was ſet up, it ought now to be taken down, or Reſtrained; And the Limits of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction Confined within the Extent of the Civil Power, and Exerciſed for its Eaſe, Safety and Benefit. And it ſeems to Me to be a Matter not to be deſpiſed, that though the Holy Scriptures of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament were written under the Government of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and in the time of its greateſt Height and Glory; yet the word Emperour, (ſo far as I can Call to mind) is no where to be found there. Indeed there is a Precept Relating to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> by Reaſon of a particular Queſtion, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it to that Name, and the word <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which moſtly Anſwers it, was thought too preſumptuous; However it is, the Security the New Teſtament gives them, is only by Commanding Obedience to the Higher Powers, or in the like Phraſes, never mentioning their diſtinct Title. But though the Name of Kings was odious to the <hi>Romans,</hi> yet moſt of the Evangelical Precepts, which Require Obedience to the Civil Power, expreſsly direct it to Kings; ſo that they ſeem to be given not only with a Spirit of Propheſie, that that great unweldy Body ſhould fall in pieces, and be divided into ſeveral King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, but alſo with a ſpecial deſign to ſecure and oblige all Chriſtians to Obedience and Submiſſion to ſuch Kings. And if we further conſider, that our Bleſſed Saviour hath told us, <hi>That his Kingdom is not of this World;</hi> And that the Chriſtian Religion teacheth Self denial and Renunciation of the World, and Requires all Chriſtians, eſpecially the Governours of the Church, to be of a moſt Humble, peaceable and exemplary Behaviour.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34855:34"/>
This kind of Proceedings in its Covernment will ſeem moſt agreeable and natural to it; For the Buſineſs of Church-Governours is to promote the Intereſt and Power of the Goſpel, not pertinaciouſly to ſtrive for Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to its prejudice and diſhonour. If each Changes happen in Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dane Affairs, that by Alteration of the Bounds of Temporal Principalities, one Biſhop gain and another loſe; yet the Church of God loſeth nothing but hereby gains its Peace, and a good opinion amongſt the Princes of the Earth; And Church-Governours have the greater freedom and more Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to do good. But the inſiſting upon Juriſdiction in another Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes Dominion, is to take his Subjects from him; It ever cauſeth Diſturbances, Creates Jealouſies in Princes, and makes them think thoſe who ſhould be the beſt Chriſtians, to be the worſt Subjects; And for that cauſe to have the meaner opinion of Religion it ſelf; It would therefore certainly be beſt with the Church of God, and moſt conduce to its happy Government, if this Rule were obſerved in all Chriſtian Kingdoms, that the Juriſdictions of Biſhops ſhould Comply with, and Conform to the Diviſions &amp; Boundaries of the Civil Power. This was the true primitive Practice, and this the Biſhops have ever been inclinable to, when they have been able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that everlaſting Encroacher the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi> Of which take this one Inſtance, Immediately after the Synod at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt <hi>Photius,</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie aroſe, to whoſe Dioceſs the <hi>Bulgarians,</hi> then newly Converted to the Faith, ſhould belong. The Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> (who never loſt any thing for want of demanding it) made ſtrong Claim by his Legats. Upon this Account there Meets before the Emperour in his Palace, <hi>Ignatius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> then newly Reſtored, the Vicars of the Eaſtern Patriarchs, <hi>i. e.</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Antioch</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Legats of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Legats of the <hi>Bulgarians.</hi> But upon debate, in ſpite of all the Endeavours of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legats, it is unanimouſly given to the <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolitan,</hi> and ſuch a Reaſon along with it, as might have ſatisfied any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, except Meſſengers from <hi>Rome,</hi> who are never to be ſatisfied with any thing, but with what ſhall be acceptable to their Maſters inſatiable Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, and boundleſs Ambition.

Now though the Pope might think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to ſtickle for his profits, and above all for his Supremacy, yet the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> themſelves did not think the Changes in Religion of ſuch Weight, that upon that Account they ſhould make a perfect Schiſm.

Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> for what Reaſon the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> held Communion with us till ſuch Excommunication, for the ſame it might have continued to this day, and no Schiſm made. But if this Excommunication had neither law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Authority, nor juſt cauſe, then will the Pope be not only the Author but cauſe of the Schiſm, and draw the whole guilt of it on him and his party. The proof of this in particular I will not inſiſt on here, becauſe it will be abundantly done in the progreſs of the Work, eſpecially in the ſecond and third part, if it ſhall pleaſe God that I live to Finiſh them. Only here I will leave this Choak-pear, which I deſire my Adverſary to ſwallow before he Attaqae me, That whoſoever undertakes the Defence of that Bull, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all other Extravagancies which he ſhall be obliged to maintain) muſt in the firſt place fairly Confeſs himſelf to be a Rebel and a Traytor as to Principles of Civil Government, and obliged in Conſcience actually to be ſo, as often as the Pope requires, and of this the Pope to be the ſole and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable Judge.</p>

Having here ſlipt into the mention of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it may not be altogether impertinent to Acquit Her of one diſhonourable Scandal, wherewith ſome foul Mouth'd <hi>Romaniſts</hi> endeavour to Blaſt her Memory. If <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth belonged to any, he was certainly theirs not ours; Yet in Handling the Reformation, they ſpare not to charge Him with all the indecencies true or falſe, which they can Rake together; But nothing is more exagitated then his two Firſt Marriages, and that often in ſuch ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and obſcene Language, as is not a little offenſive to chaſt Eares. The Deſign of all this is, that they might invalidate Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Title to the Crown, upon which ſcore ſome ruder <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will at this day as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly and confidently call Her Baſtard, as if ſhe had been found in the ſtreets, laid at ſome door in a Basket. It is well known, that ſhe was a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſo excellently qualified for Government, that even living ſhe ſtruck Envy dumb, and made thoſe who moſt implacably hated Her, to Admire Her? It might therefore juſtly move Indignation in any Generous Spirit to ſee every Aſs ſpurn at a dead Lion. But if this were as rrue as it is falſe, yet if they would deal ingeniouſly, they muſt confeſs, that this could no way effect the Church, as to that Power Conferred on it by God, and that Authority, which doth always diſtinctly and entirely remain in it ſelf; Only it may leave the Church deſtitute of any Legal Civil Sanction during her time; And if for tbat they will Condemn us, they may as well Condemn the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches of the firſt three Hundred Yeares, and then we ſhall not be much afraid in ſo good Company.

Their other Objections are of two Sorts, Either againſt the Legality or the Validity of our Ordination. But becauſe Others have An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them fully in every minute particular, I ſhall Content my ſelf with two General Anſwers; Firſt, That the Neglect or Overſight, (if any ſuch were) of ſome Circumſtances Required by Law, though it may make the Perſons obnoxious, yet it doth not invalidate the Ordination; Our Laws Allow Perſons to be Married only betwixt Eight and Twelve in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon; Yet if it Happen, that they be Married at Ten at Night, the Marriage is
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34855:38"/>
good, though the Perſons be puniſhable. Some Circumſtances in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagery of Ordination may be Regulated by the Civil Power, <hi>i. e.</hi> So fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as it hath Regard to the State; But the Ordination it ſelf, and the Va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>dity of it proceeds from a Power ſo diſtinct from the Civil, that no Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Sanction can either make or diſannul it, And therefore ſuch Objections whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h are made only againſt the Legality of our Ordination, do tacitely ſuppoſe the Validity of it; And ſo if they were true, are little or nothing to the purpoſe. As for the other ſort of Objections which relate to the Validity of our Ordination, thoſe indeed would be fatal, if they were ſufficient. But before I Return my General Anſwer thereto, I deſire it may be obſerved, That there is more of Intereſt then Matter in theſe Objections. For the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſuch a Jealouſie of this ſmall Church, that they think not themſelves ſafe while it is in being; Now if they could inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate our Ordination, it would take away our Miniſtry, our Ordinances, and conſequently our Church, ſo that this is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And though their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments be never ſo weak, yet being Managed by ſubtile Heads, they will Appear the more Conſiderable; becauſe few Perſons are able to judge of a Caſe of this Nature.

It is true, that a Diſpenſation from <hi>Rome</hi> was talked of, but that was only a Blind. A Diſpenſation may Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

'Tis true, they very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly burnt <hi>Ridley,</hi> and one or two others, without degrading them as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; And thence Conclude, that they were never truly ſuch, <hi>i. e.</hi> They ſet up a Novel Opinion, and prove it by their own wicked Actions; And the proof will be good, when they are as infal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But it is no New thing for the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to make quite contrary Determinations as to the ſelf-ſame thing, as their preſent Intereſt leads them. When Queen <hi>Mary</hi> firſt came to the Crown, and they wanted Help, then King <hi>Eawards</hi> Biſhops are to be Invited in, and Acknowledged with the ſlight <hi>Salvo</hi> of a Diſpenſation, that the Pope might ſeem to do ſomething; But when they were a little ſetled in the Saddle, and could Ride over all who ſtood in their way; Then none of his Biſhops were to be Acknowledged, who did not fully Comply with them; <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe who joyned with them were good Biſhops; thoſe who oppoſed them were no Biſhops; though the Orders of both ſtood upon the ſame Foundation, and were either valid or null for the ſame Reaſon. But to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the tediouſneſs of diſcuſſing the whole Matter, I ſhall now only Give this General Anſwer, That in this Way of Arguing they take the Courſe to undermine and deſtroy all Succeſſion and Church-power; This I am apt to think, that many of them well enough ſee; But they think, that we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4+ letters">

'Tis true, we are not deſirous to Moleſt others, we wiſh Peace to the Churches, Reaſonable things would Content us; and therefore we generally keep on the defenſive part, and ſtand all their Attacks and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. But if by ſuch foul dealing they will continually provoke us, till we change the ſtate of this Scribling War, and bring it into their own Countrey, what Work will this make? For if they will Vouch thoſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to be good againſt our Orders; And we prove, that they are of no leſs force againſt their own, or that we have other ſtronger Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, whither will they then go for Eccleſiaſtical Authority? their

pride and ſtomach is too great to Truckle to the <hi>Greek,</hi> or any other Church, or to Borrow any Authority from them; But if they ſhould, they ought to Conſider, whether the ſame Arguments will not follow them; yea more, whether divers of their Hot-ſpurs have not Carried them thither already? If ſo, all their Labour is in vain: And if their Arguments be good, all Church power and Succeſſion is loſt. This indeed doth not ſo fatally affect us as it doth them; becauſe we for good Reaſons deny thoſe Arguments to be good, and ſo keep up our Succeſſion and Eccleſiaſtical Authority. But what will become of that Church, or what Remedy is left for it, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately maintains the Validity of ſuch Arguments, when they are proved as valid againſt her ſelf? eſpecially it being a Church of that pride and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, as to ſcorn to own any Authority in any other Church, which ſhe hath not more fully in her ſelf. Now, if rather then not deſtroy our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they will what in them Lies overthrow all Eccleſiaſtical Authority and Succeſſion, though thanks be to God they cannot do it, yet it is Apparent, that they will hazard the very Worſhip of God, and ſhake the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Religion, rather then be fruſtrated in their malicious Purpoſes and ambitious Deſignes.

Hoc crit Teſtimonium Veritaetis ubique occupantis Principatum,</hi> (de Praeſcrip.) Now let them Charge us, if they can, with Maintaining any Doctrine, as of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to Salvation, which came not from Chriſt or his Apoſtles; and when
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34855:40"/>
they can prove that all theſe did, they ſhall make Me believe any thing. Only by the Way I cannot but take Notice of the difference between this good Old Father, and the preſent <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in their Reſolution of Faith, or in the laſt Reſult, Standard and Trial of Faith. The One Refers us to what our Saviour taught by Commiſſion from the Father, and the Apoſtles by Authority from Him, and to Examine Matters by their Agreement here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: The other without more ado Reſolves all into the Authority of the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Church. The One ſaith, <hi>It is the Way of Truth, becauſe the ſame that Chriſt and his Apoſtles Taught;</hi> The Other ſaith, <hi>We cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, becauſe the Preſent</hi> Roman <hi>Church Voucheth it to be Right.</hi> Now though for my own part I Adhere to the Opinion of the Father, and therein of the Ancient Church; yet I muſt Confeſs, that the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> whether right or wrong, have laid their Plot well; for if they can once bring a Man to ſwallow this Propoſition, <hi>That the</hi> Roman <hi>Church is the only certain Rule and Judge of Truth;</hi> Or, <hi>That all thinge muſt give Way to their Determinations;</hi> Then as for Particulars, his Work is done, and he is bound with an implicit Faith to ſwallow them all without any ſcruple, or the leaſt Examination: Now this is ſure and quick Work; but too quick for Me, who as a Chriſtian lying under an Obligation, upon occaſion to Render a Reaſon of the Faith that is in Me, would be willing to know a Reaſon, that I may be able to do ſo. That the <hi>Roman</hi> Church ſaith ſo will be no Reaſon, till ſhe produce a better Charter for her Authority, then ſhe hath yet done; And till I and O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hers can be ſatisfied by good Reaſon or Evidence of ſuch Authority. For if a Reaſon be Required of Me, my Anſwer that Others ſay ſo will be none, unleſs I can convince them by good Evidence, that their Say-ſo is of ſufficient Authority and indubitable, the Plea indeed of Indefectibility were good, if it were true; But they rather urge that becauſe it ſerves their Turns, then that they have any good Evidence of it: And the Father, who directs us to trace Truth to the Apoſtolical Churches, ſuppoſes that particular Churches may fall from it. <hi>Sicut</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Apoſtoli non diverſa inter ſe docuiſſent, ita &amp; Apoſtolici non contrarià Apoſtolis edidiſſent, niſi illi, qui ab Apoſtolis deſciverant; &amp; aliter praedicaverunt,</hi> (de Praeſcrip.) The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> indeed lay their Scene wiſely, they underſtand well enough what would do their Buſineſs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly fail not to plead what muſt do it with thoſe, who Admit their Plea without proof; The Conſequence or Building would be good, if the Antecedent or Foundation were ſound: But you muſt not narrowly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine that, leſt a Rotten Bottom tumble all the ſtately Pageant down again. If the <hi>Roman</hi> Church be indefectible by Vertue of any Promiſe made to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> then other Churches may uſe the ſame Arguments, and lay Claim to the ſame Privileges as well as they; And our own Church as much as any; For their own Authors, and particularly our Sworn Enemy Father
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34855:40"/>
                  <hi>Parſons,</hi> ſay, that St. <hi>Peter</hi> Preached the Goſpel in <hi>Britany;</hi> ſo that here we are equal, unleſs it make any thing for their Advantage, that he was ſo well uſed here as to Go off ſafely hence; But after his Return was Martyred there; And ſo <hi>Rome</hi> may Value her ſelf for that which our Bleſſed Saviour upbraids <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for, <hi>Killing the Prophets, and Stoning thoſe that were ſent unto Her,</hi> (Matt. 23. 37.)</p>
               <p n="41">XLI. This Matter will fall hereafter under a more particular Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; And therefore to Return to Doctrine, it may be Conſidered either as Poſitive or Negative. It is true, that all Doctrine Reſolves it ſelf into poſitive Truth; That we Maintain any thing in the Negative is Accidental, and Ariſeth from the Difference and Quarrels amongſt Men; for when Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties cannot Agree, if One Affirm, the Other of courſe denies: In this Caſe, the Matter in Controverſie being either Falſhood or Wrong, if any Man Aſſert that which is contrary either to Truth or Juſtice, we are forced to go ſomthing the further about in defending them, by firſt denying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting what is either falſe or unjuſt; but then this will terminate in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing poſitive, which is the Foundation and Summary of all. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if in Oppoſition to the Practices or Affirmations of Others I deny, That Divine Worſhip can be Given either to Angels or Saints; The Reaſon and Ground of that Denial muſt be this or the like poſitive Aſſertion, That Divine Worſhip is Gods Propriety, and to Him only to be directed. And therefore that we Maintain ſome things in the Negative, is not our but their fault, in Aſſerting that which is either falſe or unlawful; And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do ſo or not muſt be Tried by Particulars, which I ſhall come to hereafter.</p>
               <p n="42">XLII. As to poſitive Doctrines perhaps the Difference is not very great; the Quarrel lies more in what we do not hold, then in what we do; It is not to be denied that we have much Truth, but not enough as they think; And we are afraid of more, leſt it ſhould make us have leſs; for many Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which they would thruſt upon us for Truth, are far remote from it; And ſhould we receive them, it were the way to corrupt the Truth we have; There was a time when ſome of their Prieſts ſet themſelves to Reconcile, (and without Allowance and Encouragement they durſt not have Attempted ſuch a thing) the very Articles of our Religion to a Catholick Senſe, (as they call it,) though many of them were purpoſely framed in oppoſition to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of their Opinions and Practices. The Author of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>(Part</hi> 5. <hi>page</hi> 206.) hath di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>covered a Senſe, wherein that great Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the <hi>Roinaniſts, The Oath of Supremacy</hi> may be lawfully taken, and that to no other Senſe then what he fetcheth from the 37th. of our Articles of Religion; And why then all that Labyrinth of Diſcourſe which follows after upon it, and ſerves to no other purpoſe but to Confound Himſelf and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34855:41"/>
his Reader? For can it be imagined, that we our ſelves ſhould take it in a ſenſe contrary to our Articles of Religion? From our Book of Common Prayer might be Extracted a wholeſom Body of Divinity; And it ſhews to the World both what our Worſhip is, and how our Worſhip and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine Agree; And if this may be Allowed of, methinks we ſhould not be Hereticks. Now what <hi>Vincentius Parapalia,</hi> the Pope's Legat, propoſed to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> I am apt to think was known to few; For on the one Hand the Honour of the Pope was concerned, if he ſuffered an open R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But that ſome ſuch Conſiderable Matters were propoſed, that he was Jealous the Queen would think they would never be performed, or at leaſt not long kept, we have ſome Reaſon to Gueſs from the Concluſion of his Letter, which is one of the Kindeſt that ever any Pope wrote to one He Accounted a Heretick; For thus He Courts Her, <hi>Sed hâc de re pluribus verbis idem</hi> Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centius <hi>tecum aget, &amp; noſtrum tibi Paternum animum decla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

As for the Matter of the Book it is ſuch, that (except ſome few, which all Men of any ſober Communion never eſteemed otherwiſe then as Mad Men) Perſons of any Communion in the Chriſtian World may ſafely joyn in it. When any bring their particular Objections, whether <hi>Romaniſts</hi> or Others, they ſhall receive their Anſwers. As for the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> I am apt to think, that they would rather adde to it: But becauſe we think thoſe to be ſuch Matters as would corrupt it; That muſt be Tried by the Examination of Particulars, which is not the buſineſs of this place.</p>

And had not that God, who takes Care of his Church, cauſed the Cheat to be diſcovered, it would have done more Miſchief, then all the diligence and pains of all the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in the World could ever have made a juſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for. But this it is, for a particular Church to ſet up for Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; which is a point that can never be gained, without putting out the Eyes of all at preſent living, and ſtopping the Mouths of all that went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them: For though I beleeve, that God will never deſert his Church in all parts of it in Matters neceſſary to Salvation, yet he has not given her any Power over the Faith, but She is Tied to that and that alone which was at firſt delivered to the Saints; And if the <hi>Roman</hi> or any other Church, or an Angel from Heaven ſhould teach any other doctrine, then what we have received, they ought to be ſo far from being regarded, that, if we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low St. <hi>Paul,</hi> they ought to be Accurſed. That we Adhere to the Scriptures, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> cannot juſtly blame us, becauſe they themſelves Acknowledge their divine Authority. For, ſee the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> doth. <hi>(Seſs.</hi> 4. <hi>decret. de Caen Script')</hi> but they accuſe us as too ſtrict Scripturiſts, upon two Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, Firſt, becauſe we Admit not Tradition to be of equal Authority with the Holy Scriptures. Secondly, becauſe we receive not ſeveral Books as Canonical, or of unqueſtionable divine Authority, which they have thruſt into the Canon. As for Tradition and its Authority, I ſhall Treat of it more diſtinctly in the next Paragraph, and there anſwer this Accuſation. As for the Canon of Scripture, we own the very ſame and no other, which
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34855:42"/>
the Church of God hath Handed down to us, after the Canon of Scripture was Compleated: As for thoſe Books Called <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> which the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> firſt made Canonical, it is Apparent, That we do not by that Title utterly Condemn them, but rather Repute them of an Inferiour or Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Authority; becauſe we Read them in our Churches for Inſtruction of Manners, and inciting to good Living; And ſometimes uſe them for the Illuſtration of Doctrine, but never to Introduce or Found any Doctrine upon, and this is as much as the Ancients allowed them. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was the Keeper and Preſerver of the Canon of the Old Teſtament, as much as the Chriſtian is of the Old and New now: But they had none of thoſe Books in their Canon; And therefore if any Aſſert, that thoſe Books do belong to the Canon, the Conſequence will be, That the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church did not preſerve the Canon of Scripture entire and true, and for the ſame Reaſon any one may ſuſpect the Chriſtian, and ſo render the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the whole dubious: So injurious are the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to the Faith it ſelf, whileſt they ſet up their own Authority againſt the whole Church of God. Beſides, if they will not own, that we received the entire Canon of the Old Teſtament from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, they ought to tell us from whom we did receive it, and to whoſe Cuſtody it was Committed till the time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles? But whoever will be at the pains to read the <hi>Scholaſtical Hiſtory of the Canon of Scripture,</hi> Written by our Learned Dr. <hi>Coſins</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Dureſme,</hi> will be abundantly ſatisfied, that the Tridentines under pretence of Tradition have Enlarged the Canon of Scripture, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Tradition of the Church of God in all Ages, even to their own time. Thus when Modern Mens bare word muſt be allowed a ſufficient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to Vouch a Tradition, a Pretence of Tradition is ſet up againſt the truth of it, and ſo Tradition it ſelf rendred doubtful or uſeleſs; And therefore I ſhall not trouble my ſelf to purſue thoſe many particular ſhuffling pleas, which they uſe to Juſtify themſelves in offering violence to the Sacred Canon; But if you would know the true Reaſon, which it was their Buſineſs to Conceal; I believe <hi>Spalato</hi> hath Hit on it, <hi>Suas non poterant Naenias ex Sacrâ Scripturâ verè Canonicâ probare, ideoque noluerunt permittere, uc ſibi aliae Scripturae etiam non Canonicae eriperentur, quo ſuas qualeſcunque haberent pharetras, unde ſpicula deſumerent, ac praeterea viderent, ac praeterea ne viderentur re in aliquâ Proteſtantibus cedere aut conſentire, maluerunt etiam falſa tueri &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finire.</hi> (de Repub.

Now it being the great Buſineſs of Hereticks to corrupt the Scriptures, and wreſt them to a wrong ſenſe, that they might ſeem to have a ſufficient Authority patronizing their Errours; When it ſo Hapned, the Ancient Church uſually declined the Nice Way of Cavilling and Captious Diſputes, and fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

That this is no prejudice to the Scriptures, being the only ſufficient Rule of Faith; for though the Apoſtles wrote and taught the ſame things, and ſo both were alike a Rule to the then living Perſons; yet when thoſe things were put in Writing, it was for this very Reaſon, <hi>That a Sure and Certain Rule might be Preſerved for Poſterity;</hi> For Tradition might in time be miſtaken, forgotten or corrupted; But the Scriptures would remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable. So that the Scriptures are the Rule to us, though there are many Helps to lead us to their true Meaning of which perhaps genuine Tradition is none of the worſt. But this makes nothing againſt the perfection and ſufficiency of the Scriptures, which contain all things neceſſary to Salvation, though they do not find us Eyes to ſee, nor Ears to hear, nor Brains to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider; though God doth all this, and all other Helps abundantly. All Arts and Sciences are ſuppoſed to be Complete in themſelves, and to contain Rules ſufficient to inſtruct a Man in them; And yet ſome of the Nobleſt of them can never be thoroughly Attained, unleſs a Man be firſt Inſtructed in the Rudiments of ſome other Arts or Sciences preliminary, and preparatory to them. But the Scriptures being the moſt perfect Rule, as proceeding from the All-wiſe God, and leading to the Nobleſt End, why ſhould not Others or rather all be ſubſervient to them? yet this is ſo far from making th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m leſs, that it argues their greater Perfection. Secondly, That nothing be Admitted as a Tradition, which hath not ſome Apparent Foundation in Scripture, for that being the undoubted Word of God, whatever is not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>owardneſs,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34855:44"/>
the Rule in ſome Caſes being not ſo clear, a true primitive Tradition, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Matters contained in Scripture, may be very uſeful to lead us to the true Senſe, as in the Caſe of Infants Baptiſm, the Obſervation of the Lords Day, and ſome other Matters. For all the Churches of God from the firſt times, having Baptized Infants, and duely obſerved the Lords Day, it muſt be ſuppoſed, That the Apoſtles did unanimouſly ſo teach the firſt Churches, and conſequently that thoſe General Precepts concerning Baptiſm in Scripture, are incluſive of the Children of believing Parents; And that thoſe Scriptural Inſtances of the Obſervation of the Lords Day, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to direct our Practice: Nor let any Man think, that the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will be Gainers by this; for I will never deny any Truth for fear of giving Advantage to an Adverſary: Whatever they can prove from Scripture, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by ſuch truly primitive Tradition, as ſhall be agreeable to the two foregoing and the following Cautions, I ſhall freely yield to them or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party. But if the Matter come to this Iſſue, they muſt loſe all the moſt Conſiderable things, for which they Contend with us. I know they make great Flouriſhes, and pretend Scripture back'd with Tradition, for Purgatory and ſome other Fopperies; But what can I or any Man help it, if they will uſe the beſt means for the worſt Ends? They know good Rules, but uſe them ill. For as for ſuch a Notion of Purgatory, which they have ſet up, and ſuch a Uſe for it as they have deviſed; as there is not any Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of it in Scripture, ſo was it utterly unknown to the primitive Church; or if it could have been known, would have been Abominated. And if Men will have the Impudence to pretend without any colour for their Pretences, yet I will not forſake a good Courſe becauſe they abuſe it. Thirdly, that nothing be admitted as a genuine Tradition, but what was univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and wherein all the primitive Churches were agreed, according to that known Rule of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis, Quod ubique, quod ſemper, quod ab <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2+ letters">

What the Apoſtles taught for the Common Concern of our Salvation in any one Church, they taught the ſame in all; and therefore unleſs they all Agree, that there is a Miſtake is certain, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a Tradition, or where it lies is uncertain; and ſo at leaſt it is uſeleſs.

Fourthly, That Traditions be always deduced from the Firſt Ages of the Church; for Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are received, not made; And if they proceeded not from Apoſtles and Apoſtolick Perſons, they can never become genuine Traditions after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. What was delivered to the firſt Churches, though ſince neglected, loſt or forgotten, was a true and genuine Tradition; and is ſo ſtill, if it can be diſcovered; But if any thing be Vouched as a Tradition, though of a Thouſand yeares ſtanding and more; yet if it came not from the Firſt Churches, it is not a Tradition but an Impoſture; And ſuch are moſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> Traditions, much like thoſe of the Phariſees, of whom our Saviour ſaith, <hi>That they had made the Commandment of God of none effect by their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,</hi> (Mat, 15. 6.) and yet they called them the Traditions of the Elders, <hi>(verſe</hi> 2.) and ſtood then up for their Antiquity as ſtoutly as the Other do now. But (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> obſerves, <hi>lib. de Praeſerip.) Veritas mendacio prior eſt.</hi> And therefore here we are to follow, not <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

None indeed ought to contemn them, but they may lawfully either uſe or diſuſe them, as their preſent Churth-Governours ſhall think Fitting for the benefit of the preſent Churches. Some Traditions are more Univerſal, as proceeding from the Apoſtles themſelves; but if they be only concerning things in their own Nature indifferent, neither are theſe immutably binding. That ſome ſuch were is Apparent from that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (1 Cor. 11. 34.) <hi>The Reſt will I ſet in Order when I come:</hi> But if any Man can certainly tell Me what Orders he made, <hi>Erit mihi magnus</hi> Apollo: And perhaps the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle never Committed them to Writing, leſt an over-great Veneration to Apoſtolical Authority ſhould Run other Churches into an inconvenience; For thoſe very Orders, though moſt wiſely Fitted to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> might at the ſame time be inconvenient for other Churches, yea, for the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34855:45"/>
very ſelf-ſame Church in following times. For though ſome indifferent things muſt of Neceſſity be determined, becauſe otherwiſe the Solemn Worſhip will unavoidably be diſorderly and indecent, yet ſuch Orders can never be ſo Fixed for all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Again, ſome Traditions concern the Practice of the Univerſal Church, which obtained in all places, and theſe have their Ground and Warrant from Scripture; but their particular Determination from Church-Authority, which is ſtill preſerved to us by Tradition; Of this we have a clear Inſtance in the Faſts and Feaſts of the Church, as Gods Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mercies require our Solemn Thankſgiving, ſo our own Sins, eſpecially the publick, Call on us openly to Humble our Souls before God, and to give manifeſt Teſtimony of our Repentance; Beſides, to tame our unruly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and Fit us for the diſcharge of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

If it be obſerved, that our own Faſts and Feaſts are ill obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; I grant it to be true, but I ſay it is not our fault; Ill Men and ill Times have been and ſtill are too hard for us; and not to Complain of the too many Obſtructions of Diſcipline, (without which no Church can long ſtand, much leſs flouriſh, which is the Reaſon that all Parties whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever have unanimouſly combined to hinder the Exerciſe of our Diſcipline, that by that means they might have opportunity, upon all Occaſions, to make their full blow at the Church it ſelf) though our Church hath had the Laws on her ſide, yet ſhe hath ever had the Lawyers (without whom the reſt could have done nothing) her Enemies, who have made even the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves either inſignificant or hurtful to Her. I ſpeak not of the whole Body of them, for there are many Honeſt and Honourable Perſons amongſt them; But there want not enough, who are ſworn Enemies of Church-Diſcipline, and all Eccleſiaſtical Authority; who lay Trains and Snares for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Church if they execute it; And if any Man be Conſtrained to defend the Sanctions or Rights of the Church, they will encourage Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and make Intereſts againſt Him, lead him thorough all the Courts in the Kingdom, till they have undone him; And expoſe Him as if he were the vileſt Man living: They will neither ſuffer the Cenſures of the Church to take place, nor her Rights to be gotten; Nay, more I will be bold to ſay, that partly by quite diſcharging ſome Tithes, and by Erecting lewd Mod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Now what can we do againſt theſe, and many other powerful and inveterate Opponents, whom I will not Name? Our Conſtitutions are good; We wiſh and endeavour what we fairly can, that they may be kept: They muſt Anſwer it to God Almighty, who will not ſuffer it. But to leave Complaining, where we are like to have no Remedy, and return to our Matter: As to Traditions of Matters of Practice, diſtinction muſt be made between the Matter of the Tradition and the Circumſtances of it; Tradition as to Circumſtances may differ in different places and may be Altered by the Power of the Church.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34855:47"/>
that General Councels, or others, are of greateſt Uſe and Benefit to the Church of God, when lawfully called and duely managed, where ſerious, continued and unanimous Prayers are put up for Gods Aſſiſtance, where Matters are freely and fairly debated, and where not only the Intentions but Endeavours of the Parties, are wholly bent to diſcover the Truth of God, not to Gratifie any Party of Men. For if God have promiſed to be with two or three, who are Gathered together in his Name, Surely, he will not be wanting to the Governours of his People, and the wiſeſt and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereſt of Chriſtians, when Met together, to diſcover to the Chriſtian World the poiſon of Hereticks, and to ſerve the Neceſſities of his Church, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that they take due Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And where Men are ſatisfied of the Regularity of their Proceedings, though they ſhould not be ſo well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in their Determinations, yet the Authority of the Perſons, and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionableneſs of their Proceedings, would be an Awe at leaſt upon all ſober and Rational perſons, and make them cautious of diſturbing the Churches Peace. Nor doth it ſeem to be without Encouragement and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that the primitive Chriſtians in difficult Caſes Fled to General Councels as their Sovereign Remedy. For the Apoſties themſelves ſet them a Precedent, and the firſt Councel at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> (though ſmall, yet perhaps the moſt General that ever was) was a Pattern worthy Imitation. For though the Apoſtles had ſeverally the Hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Ghoſt, and were the Perſons pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely Choſen to make known to Mankind the extraordinary Revelations of Gods Will; and ſo might have determined any Queſtion concerning any ſuch Matter by their own Authority; yet the Quarrel ariſing between the Jews and Gentiles concerning Circumciſion, and in the Conſequence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the whole Ceremonial Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> though they knew that one great End of Chriſts Coming was to aboliſh it, to fulfil its Types, and ſet up a more ſpiritual Worſhip; yet the whole Church being divided by this means into two Parties, they would not determine the Matter till Met in Councel together; that a full debate, and their unanimous Conſent might give the greater ſatisfaction to all. And indeed their Proceedings are an admirable Copy, for all following Councels to write after; even they, who beſt might, do not Magiſterially give us their Naked Decrees and Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions; for though they had the Holy Ghoſt, and in their Decree did ſay, <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us;</hi> yet they do not ſay this, before they had undeniably provod, that it did ſeem good to the Holy Ghoſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to them. For St. <hi>Peter</hi> clearly proves, that God Himſelf had
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34855:48"/>
already determined the Matter in the Caſe of <hi>Cornelius;</hi> And then <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> as clearly proved Gods further Confirmation of it by Miracles and Wonders wrought amongſt the Gentiles, whileſt they Preached the Goſpel to them. So that here was nothing left for Men to ſay againſt the Decrees of the Councel, unleſs they would Argue againſt God. And though the ſame degree of Evidence and fulneſs of Authority do not Attend after Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, yet it would be a great means to procure ſubmiſſion to them, when their Imitation of the Apoſtles, and Care of the Churches did Appear, by their Accompanying their Determinations with the cleareſt Evidence that might be.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Some <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will needs have every General Councel <hi>(i. e.</hi> ſuch as they Call Lawful) to be as infallible as that of the Apoſtles; but methinks they ſhould allow ſome difference, if it were only for this Reaſon, That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles did infallibIy and fully diſcover to us the whole Truth of God in order to the Salvation of Man; All that come after them have nothing more to do, then to enquire after that Truth which they taught, and which Reſts upon their Authority as Inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt; And therefore certainly there is a great difference between them, and thoſe who follow them, and are bound to build upon them, and are certainly in the wrong, whenever they depart from them. Infallibility is a word that ſounds high, and promiſeth all that Man can deſire; And therefore the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves would have it upon no other termes, but ſo, that they may have both the poſſeſſion and the uſe of it. But when we come to look for this Salve for all Sores, we know not where to find it; for they themſelves are ſo miſerably divided, that they know not where to place it. And then how can we, or indeed they themſelves, be any thing the better for it? Some ſay it is in the Church, ſome ſay in Tradition, ſome ſay in a General Councel, ſome in a Councel together with the Pope, ſome in a Councel Confirmed by the Pope, (though theſe two laſt are often od<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y Jumbled together) and ſome ſay in the Pope alone, when he defines <hi>pro Cathedrâ,</hi> and that is a Myſtery too. Now in all and each of theſe they entangle themſelves in ſome palpable Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and woful Abſurdities, that a Man might wonder, that ever ſuch Learned Men ſhould Appear in their Defence, did we not ſee by Experience, that extravagant Intereſt as well as great Oppreſſions often makes wiſe Men mad. The truth is, all theſe are ſet up as a blind, as ſhall appear in its proper place. And if their General Reaſons to prove, that there muſt be ſome ſort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Infallibility, be good, there muſt be another ſort of Infallibility ſet up then any of theſe, and ſuch as they themſelves will by no means approve, and which none have pretended to, but the worſt of Enthuſiaſts; And yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>heir Reaſons muſt prove this, if any; Such lewd Opinions do Men Run into, when they will take upon them to preſcribe to God, rather then
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34855:48"/>
obey him. And indeed it hath ſometimes ſtruck Me with horrour to ſee how boldly they tell us, what God muſt do, and how preſumptuouſly they charge him with breach of Promiſe, as Neglect of his people, if he do not make good all their Contrivances; As if God were bound to do, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever their working Brains can think fit to Advance their unworthy and unchriſtian Intereſts. No doubt but God will not fail on his part, if we neglect not our own; But to Tye Him to ſerve our humours or baſeneſs, is to provoke Him to deſert us in thoſe things, which are really moſt needful for us. But theſe things I muſt not here particularly purſue, nor ſhall I engage in the Diſpute concerning the Infallibility of General Councels, both becauſe whatever they pretend, it is not that which they would have, as alſo becauſe they have Received ſuch Anſwers already in that Matter from <hi>Spalato,</hi> the moſt Reverend A. B. <hi>Laud,</hi> the Learned Dean of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> and others, that it is now altogether a Needleſs La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
               <p n="3">III. He that takes his Aim, though never ſo carefully, yet may ſometimes miſs his Mark; And if that ſhould be my Misfortune in what I write in this place, I may in Equity expect the more favourable Uſage. For though in a good Senſe a Councel may be ſaid to be the Church Repreſentative, as I ſhall ſhew anon. Yet I have Conſidered and Conſidered again, and can by no means Reconcile to Reaſon that Notion or Propoſition, (in the ſenſe which ſome Men take and Explain it,) <hi>That a General Councel is Repreſentative of the diffuſive Body of the Church.</hi> For if it be ſo, it muſt either be by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution from God, or Delegation from Men. But that God in any Caſe hath Appointed the whole Body of Chriſtians to chooſe certain Perſons as their Repreſentatives, whoſe Acts by vertue of ſuch Election ſhall be as binding, as if it had been done by all and every Man, I think can no where be found; for my own part, I could never ſee any Footſteps of it, or any thing like it. If on the other Hand, it be by an unpreſcribed ſpontaneous Delegation from Men, it muſt either be by the whole Body of Chriſtians Met together for that purpoſe, or by Parts Aſſembled in particular Churches. The Firſt, I think, if it be not impoſſible, is altogether impracticable, as the ſtate of the Church now is: Nor was it ever put in Practice, when the Church being leſs, cloſer and better united, did not labour under thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which now it doth; As for the ſecond, it hath neither Scripture nor Antiquity on its ſide, and for that Little, which ſome may wreſt to look that way, it is ſo very little, that it may thence Appear, that the Churches of God never thought it neceſſary. For though <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and certain others were ſent up to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> about the Controverſie between the Jews and Gentiles, <hi>(Acts</hi> 15. 2.) Yet there is not any Circumſtance to lead us to think otherwiſe, but that they went by Order or Agreement of theſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:34855:49"/>
of the Churches, (among whom that Controverſie had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, but could not be finally decided, by reaſon of the turbulency of the Jews) and not by Election of the People: And when the Councel Met at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though all Chriſtians had freedom to Appear in it; yet when the Apoſtles and Elders are ſaid to come together to Conſider of the Matter, <hi>(verſe</hi> 6.) they Met by their own Authority. And further, if a Councel be ſo the Church Repreſentative, that in Order to its being a Repreſentative, it be neceſſary, that the Perſons Appearing be Elected from the Church-Members of particular Churches; the Conſequence will be, That the firſt four Famous General Councels were not lawful Councels; for they Met by the Emperours Summons, not by Election from the People; And therefore upon this Suppoſition could not be duely Convocated. Beſides, if a Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the People or Church-Members be neceſſary, let the Honour or Orders of the Perſons deputed be what it will, they muſt Repreſent moſtly as Laymen; for ſuch are Incomparably the far greater Number; But we read not of any Biſhops Sitting in Councel, but as Biſhops, and ſubſcribing as Biſhops, and taking place there by vertue of their own Authority as Biſhops, not by any Deputation; unleſs perhaps ſome Perſon Appeared for ſome abſent Biſhop as well as himſelf, or as the Legate of ſome Biſhop; But then a Commiſſion or Deputation from that abſent Biſhop was ſufficient without ſo much as Conſulting any Church-Members. I do not ſay, but that ſome Perſons were Choſen on purpoſe to be ſent to Councels, but then they were either ſuch Prieſts or Deacons, as the Biſhops thought Fit to take along with them, or were pitch'd on by the Advice of their Clergy. And we have a Cuſtom amongſt our ſelves, that Two out of every Dioceſs be Choſen and ſent to the Provincial Synod or Convocation; And though it is Reaſonable that ſome ſhould be there, who by daily Inſpection and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience underſtand the Countreys Affairs, and the Circumſtances of the Rural Clergy, upon whom not the leaſt part of the Burthen lies; yet the great Reaſon i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And indeed the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> themſelves, though they talk loud of a Councels being the Churches Repreſentative, yet ſometimes they are as dumb again, and willing to let it ſleep, or to ſhift it off. When they have to do with private Perſons, or ſuch whom they Call Hereticks, then they talk big of their pack'd Councels, and what a Madneſs it is to withſtand the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the whole Church of God; This looks great, and ſeems to

carry no ſmall Authority with it: But if Diſcou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rſe happen of a Councel in Relation to the Pope, then they are as Mute as Fiſhes, or Mince the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and will by no means be induced to ſpeak out as to any ſuch Authority in Councels of themſelves. And it is well known, That the Tridentines were never ſuffered to uſe the Phraſe, <hi>Repraeſentans univerſalem Eccleſiam,</hi> though many ſtickled hard for it, the Pope being in no ſmall fear, that an Inferenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But the Queſtion concerning the Right to, or Exerciſe of Authority in any diffuſive Body of Men, whether Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, perhaps deſerves a more thorough Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, then it hath ever yet undergone; And conſequently, whether any can? And if any, then who and how far they can make a Repreſentative? I may perhaps have Occaſion to diſcourſe of it hereafter, but ſhall not in this place.</p>

If therefore we ſhould ſay, That a Councel, <hi>(i. e.</hi> as far as Relates to ſuch Churches, whoſe Biſhops Appear in Councel) is the Church Authoritative; and in Conſequence the Repreſentative, as bringing with it all that Authority Chriſt left in his Church, and which he Lodg'd in his Church-Officers, by Vertue of which Authority they Repreſent, and not by any Deputation from the People or Church Members; I think that (with ſubmiſſion to better Judgements) it would be much more plain in the Explication, and facile in the Reaſons of it; And thence would Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">VI. And in the firſt place, it may not be Amiſs, to Conſider what time was taken to Frame and Mould this Councel to the Popes Mind. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> having Eclipſed the Roman See in the very Height of its Greatneſs and Glory, the Popes ever ſince have looked with a maligne Aſpect upon General Councels, and the very Naming one was enough to put any of them into a Fit of a Feavour; And indeed this made following Councels not only uſeleſs but noxious. For if the Neceſſities of the Church ſeemed at any time to Require a General Councel, the Pope would never ſuffer it to be, but in ſuch place that he could Command; And always took care, that it ſhould Conſiſt of ſuch Perſons, who at leaſt for the greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were at his devotion; And yet even then was wofully uneaſie, till it was Finiſhed; ſo unwilling are Popes to truſt themſelves with a Councel, though themſelves have the packing of it. But that Spark, which firſt fell through the Claſhing of <hi>Luther</hi> and the Pardonmongers, being blown to ſuch a Flame, that no Common Help could quench it, a General Councel ſeemed neceſſary: But to Manage it for the Advantage of the Roman See, and to hold it in convenient place was a Matter of no ſmall difficulty in ſuch times of Confuſion; ſo that it ſeemed to be as dangerous to the Pope, as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Church. It was well for the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> that the greateſt Princes of thoſe times were perſwaded that it was the Popes Right, (though meerly Founded upon Uſurpation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>) to Call General Councels: For by this means they gained time to Fit Matters for their Turn; And yet though the moſt Refined Politicians in the World, it was not a little time did ſerve their Turn; For though the Popes ſucceſſively ſeemed daily willing, that ſo they might ſtop Mens Mouths, and Gratifie their Importunity, yet was it not leſs then Twenty ſeven yeares before theſe perfect Crafts-Maſters could Contrive Matters to their Mind, and then too they were rather Neceſſitated then willing, and in no ſmall fear that their Wings would be Clipt. <hi>Luthers</hi> firſt Appeal to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eneral Councel, which was quickly followed with the deſires
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:34855:51"/>
of all <hi>Germany,</hi> was in the Year 1518. But the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> did not open till the 13th. of <hi>December</hi> 1545. So long did this Compaſſionate Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſuffer the Wounds of the Church to Lye Bleeding, and at laſt only Cured them as Chyrurgions do Gangrenes, by Cutting off the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. As for the Indictions at <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Vicenza,</hi> I make no Account of them; for as it may Reaſonably be ſuſpected, that they were only Shams to gain time; ſo had either taken effect; it is certain it was a Device to keep the Councel in greater Slavery, then it was at <hi>Trent,</hi> though it was ſo great there, that little good could be expected from it, as ſhall preſently appear. And now after ſo long Plotting, having got ſomething like a Councel, in a frightful place, at a time when Chriſtian Princes were moſt jealous of each other, and the Pope had Leaſure and Opportunity to play his Game; Let us enquire into its State and Actions; And if juſt Exceptions cannot be brought againſt it, let it take place.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. I do not pretend to bring all the juſt Exceptions, which may be Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt the Councel of <hi>Trent;</hi> It is ſufficient, if thoſe few I ſhall bring; or any one of them be ſo material and to the purpoſe, as to Juſtify our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting it. Now the firſt Quarrel I have againſt them is, that the prevailing Part all along carried on a Deſign to betray the Liberties of all the Churches, and the Power of all Biſhops to the Pope, and to make him the abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the whole Church. And what good can we expect from Men, who were Traitors to their own Order? But though there could be no greater baſeneſs and falſeneſs then ſuch a Deſign, yet it muſt be Confeſſed, that never was an Intrigue Managed more Neatly, or more Slily brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, for they never Offer to put his Supremacy to the Vote, nor by any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Canon or Decree declare or give it him; for that might have Awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Sleeping Biſhops, and Alarm'd the World, and perhaps they might not have Carried it; Or if they had, yet what one Councel gave, another might take away; At leaſt he muſt have been beholding to them, and held it as their Gift, which would not do the Pope's Buſineſs. But more craftily, whileſt the Councel was intent upon other Matters, they upon all Occaſions Slu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r in ſuch words into the Decrees and Canons, which though nothing to the purpoſe, as to the Matter to be decided, (and therefore in all likelihood little Heeded) yet might infer the Pope's Supremacy by an Antecedent or Divine Right; And thus they inſenſibly put him out of the Reach of all Councels, and did their Work more effectually, then if they had ſpoke never ſo plainly, Thoſe who Heedfully Read over the Canons and Decrees of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> may furniſh themſelves with plenty of Inſtances; To Avoid Tediouſneſs I ſhall only mention ſome few. For a Trial how this would glide down, the Decree for Reformation is Uſhered in with theſe words, <hi>Eadem SS. Synodus Piis Summorum Pontificum, &amp; Probatorum Conciliorum</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:34855:52"/>
                  <hi>Conſtitutionibus inhaerens,</hi> (Seſs. 5. cap. 1.) Here the Pope is not only put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Councels, but that ye might ſee by what Right he is Adorned with the Epithet <hi>Summus;</hi> And though the Councels are ſuffered to wait on-him, yet it is with a Reſtriction, they muſt be ſuch as are <hi>Probata:</hi> Now what thoſe are, and who ſhall have the Approving them, any Man may gueſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſuſpected for a Conjurer; For with them the meaneſt Provincial Councel is as good as a General, if Confirmed by the Pope, and without his Confirmation the moſt General is not worth a Ruſh. Thus what ſhrivelled things are Councels to a Pope? But as if all Reformation Conſiſted in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting the Pope, in the Decree of Reformation, <hi>(Seſs.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 1:) He is ſtiled, <hi>Ipſius Dei in Terris Vicarius;</hi> They could hardly have made him greater, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they had ſtiled Him, <hi>Our Lord God the</hi> Pope; And in the latter part of the ſame Decree they declare him to be <hi>Captain' Mend-all,</hi> with a power to puniſh at Diſcretion, even the Higheſt Prelates of the Church; And that not by Vertue of any Truſt repoſed in Him by the Councel, but <hi>Suae Supremae Sedis A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now if they had done any thing as to the Pope before, this had undone it all: And this, with the Help of ſuch a Conſtruction as the Pope may put upon it, may enable Him to do what he will; He is now left to Carve for Himſelf, and if he want any thing it is his own fault. By what Surprize this Decree was obtained, the Hiſtorian briefly tells us. When a Councel was juſt Shutting up, few Men gave their Minds to Heed or ſtick at any thing; and therefore in the Cloſe of the day this is paſſed as a thing granted, though it had never been mentioned in any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, <hi>(Hiſt. C. T. lib.</hi> 8 <hi>pag.</hi> 812,) Now what the Authority here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned is, you may give a ſhrewd Gueſs by the Acclamation in the Shutting up of the Councel, <hi>Beatiſſimo</hi> Pio <hi>Papae, &amp; Domino noſtro, Sanctae <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nivsrſalis Eccleſiae Pontifici, &amp;c.</hi> What can he deſire more?

               <p n="8">VIII. As to the Authority of Biſhops, it was the Contrivance of the Councel all along, by all Arts poſſible, to bring it in a manner to nothing. 'Tis true, ſome were ſenſible of the Miſchief of this, and amongſt ſuch the <hi>Spaniards</hi> deſerved no mean Commendation, eſpecially <hi>Granata,</hi> then whom there was not a more brave and Magnanimous Prelate in all the Councel: It wanted not much once, but that they had out-witted the early Legats; but their honeſt Plot being diſcovered, they were quickly over-born by the <hi>Italians</hi> and Penſioners, who never Conſider what is Right, but what will ſerve the Pope's Turn: And to exalt him, it was neceſſary to depreſs all other Biſhops; for if other Biſhops be Chriſts Vicars as well as the Pope, they will be in danger to be his Fellows; but if they be only Vicars, or Delegates of Chriſts-Vicar, then they muſt ſubmit to Him as their Head, from whom they derive all their Authority. And to bring it to this Paſs they uſed many Arts, though none more effectual then this, which ſhall be the only Inſtance I ſhall produce in this place. In the Matter of Reformation it was neceſſary to ſeem to do ſomething, (though God knows their Reform<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Now though in things of greateſt Concern, the Reformation was left to the Pope, which was <hi>Magno conatu nihil agere;</hi> yet all could not be ſo Referred, and the Execution of ſuch things had been always left to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops. Now to have Committed them to any other Hands, would have been not only to bring themſelves under Eternal Infamy, but to put the World
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34855:53"/>
in a Mutiny; On the other Hand, to leave it to them would ſeem to infer a Right, if not a Divine Right in prejudice of the Pope. One would think here they had been taken in a Nooſe, but they ſlip the Knot with eaſe; And certainly never any thing was more Neatly taken away in the very giving. For when Matters came under debate, which did Require the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Juriſdiction upon the place, they then Committed it to the Biſhops, but with this Reſtriction, <hi>As Delegates of the Apoſtolick See.</hi> Here indeed the Biſhops Received a Power to Exerciſe ſome Authority, but in the very Accepting it they gave up their Right, and placed all Authority Originally in the Pope; ſo that if he pleaſed at any time to undelegate them, he did in effect unbiſhop them. And yet the only Reaſon which moved the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, <hi>St. Clemens</hi> and <hi>Alexandrinus</hi> to perſevere in their Opinioe to the laſt againſt the Confirmation of the Councel, was this, <hi>That too much Authority had been Given to Biſhops in that Councel,</hi> (Hiſt, C. T. lib. 8. p 817.) So Jealous is the <hi>Roman</hi> Court of the Authority of Biſhops, that they are not willing to Allow them the Shadow of it; And indeed they have Reaſon for it, ſor if every Bird had her own Feather, thoſe Jolly Cardinals, now Princes Mates, would Appear to be only a parcel of bald C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to take off that Decree, yet it could never be obtained; And we may Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably believe, that it was Reſolved it never ſhould, whatſoever they might pretend. For when this Decree with no ſmall Art had paſſed, the Pope was ſo well pleaſed with the News, that he wrote privately to the Legats, That they ſhould Maintain it firmly, and put it in Execution, without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting one jote, <hi>(Hiſt.

For when they had propoſed any Matter, iſ the debate did not proceed to their Mind, they took upon them to interrupt Men in their ſpeaking, and to Check, Reproach or Threaten Others; ſo that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral died of Grief or Indignation for the Diſgrace and Abuſe Received; And ſome pretended Neceſſity of Buſineſs, or want of Health, and Asked leave to depart, and were not a little glad they were got away. If this did not do, then by Prorogations and Delays they wearied Men out, and would do nothing till an Opportunity Preſented for their purpoſe. Neither was the Councel under leſs Reſtraint as to time, then Matter; they were ſo far from having any Power to Sit, till they had diſpatched the weighty Affairs they came about, that they could not Sit an Hour longer then they pleaſed their Maſters the Legats; For they had a Bull by them, empowering them to pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Enemies; and gained a clear Inſtance of the Pope's Exerciſing Juriſdiction over a Councel. And though this ſhews Him to have been a dextrous Artiſt, who could ſo eaſily turn his danger to his gain, and Kill two Birds thus with one Stone; yet it ſpeaks little in Commendation of thoſe, who what in them lay ſold the Liberties of all Chriſtians ſo Dog-cheap. And though the Pope was thus ſecured of them, yet they were not truſted: But when the Legats had prepared any thing, if it was not treated of in all Points to their liking, it was either utterly quaſhed, or laid aſide at pleaſure. When as Matter of Reformation it was propoſed to ſet down the Qualities, requiſite in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the greater Prelates and Miniſters of the Church, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly might have been of great uſe and profit to ſo diſordered and corrupt a ſtate, as the Churches Affairs were then in; It was all preſently turned out of doors, and that chiefly for this Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe more then two Thirds of the Benefices aere Reſorved to the Apoſtolick See, unto which it is not Fit to Preſcribe a Law,</hi> (Hiſt C.

And as they might not ſpeak but with Leave and Licence, ſo what they did was inſignificant, if it Chanc'd afterwards not to pleaſe the Pope. For the Councel having taken Care for Correcting the Vulgar Edition, and for procuring an exact Impreſſion, and having Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Deputies on the Work; When this News came to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope undoeth it all by his own Authority, and the Legats in purſuance of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, cauſe the Deputies to deſiſt from the Work, and to bring all they had done to them, and this without any Reſpect to the Councel, or ſo much as making them privy to it. It ſeems ſomewhat ſtrange, that they ſhould have no more at leaſt ſeeming liberty, but be uſed ſo fcornſully; For the Pope had ever the Major Party in the Councel. It began, if not altogether, yet for the moſt part with his own Creatures: And they, when but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Number, and (as the Hiſtorian ſaith) for the greater part a very ignorant Parcel of Men, deſined Matters of the greateſt Concern, which were never before defined; And too ſoon then.

This will ſtill be more plain, if we Conſider the Number of Prelates in <hi>Trent.</hi> The Catalogue at the End of the Councel tells us, that they came from four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Nations; but if it were well Examined, it would Appear, that many of the Prelates of thoſe ſev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

themſelves, leſt the World ſhould have judged it a Baſtard-Child. By the Orders of <hi>Paul</hi> the 3d. to the Legats, they were to receive from him what they ſhould propoſe, deliberate and conclude, and not to publiſh any Decree in Seſſion, before they had Communicated it at <hi>Rome, (Hiſt. C. T. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 164) And all along there were Deputies in <hi>Rome</hi> kept over the Councel, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be diſpatched in <hi>Trent,</hi> till they had firſt Conſidered, Corrected and Concluded the Matter, and ſatisfied the Pope in it: And then he ſent it to <hi>Trent,</hi> that it might paſs for their Decree. And to this purpoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches came from <hi>Rome</hi> every Week at leaſt once, and ſometimes twice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Waters were up, (as they often were there) and then the Pope could not inſpire them, but the Legats were forced to make delays, and Buſie the Councel in By-matters; of all which a very pleaſant Account is given in the Letter of the Biſhop of Five-Churches to the Emperour. And ſometimes it Hapned, that the Deputies in <hi>Rome</hi> did not underſtand the Affair ſo well as the Legats, who were upon the place; And ſo the Pope ſometimes put things upon them that were uneaſie or unſafe; And then they were at a Stand, whether they ſhould follow his Orders or his Intereſt; But the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Reſolution was to Employ the Councel in ſomething elſe, till they could give the Deputies more full Information and Satisfaction, that the Orders might be Corrected, but ſtill nothing could be Concluded in the Councel, till it was firſt Agreed on and determined at <hi>Rome;</hi> And from that they were not to depart. Now I cannot underſtand, but that thoſe who made the Decrees and Canons, were more effectually the Councel, then thoſe who publiſhed them. And being <hi>Romaniſts</hi> are apt to Ask, what Objection can be made againſt the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> which may not alſo be made againſt the Councel of <hi>Nice?</hi> I deſire to know of them, whether they will ſay, that theſe things can be truly Objected againſt the Councel of <hi>Nice?</hi> If not, then they muſt Acknowledge a wide difference.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. But ſuppoſe theſe and other Objections did not Lye againſt it, yet what is the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> to us? If the Acts of that Councel bind us it muſt either be from the Authority of the Councel, or the Nature of the things determined. If from the Nature of the things, then they are bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, and without the Councel: And ſo where the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> is in the Right, we may receive it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>or its own ſake, not the Councels; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is true, not becauſe the Tridentine Fathers ſo determined; And ſo the Plea of the Councel is laid aſide to Examine the Nature of the thing. But if thoſe Acts muſt be ſuppoſed Binding by Vertue of the Authority of the Councel, I would know how that Authority Reacheth us? for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels bind thoſe Churches; whoſe Biſhops are preſent and Conſenting to them. And though the Pope hath Uſurped the Privilege to be the only Confirmer of Councels, yet Anciently his Confirmation Reached no further
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:34855:56"/>
then to his own Church of Dioceſs at moſt; And every Biſhop had as much power to Confirm Councels as He, and the Councel ſtood in as much need of their Confirmation as his in Reſpect of their particular Churches; And their Common Stile in Subſcribing was, <hi>Ego A. B. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmavi, Corroboravi,</hi> or the like. And if they did not do thus, the Decrees and Canons of the Councel were not Reputed to be Binding to their particular Churches. If the Determinations of the Councel were thought to be of General Concern, then they were ſent to other Churches, whoſe Biſhops were not there, and they might Receive or Reject, either in whole or in part, but what they received they bound themſelves to, but not but by their own Act. Now what Biſhops of ours were at <hi>Trent?</hi> or when did we receive it or approve it <hi>ex poſt facto? Henry</hi> the 8th. was ſo far from ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Biſhops to that Councel, that he Proteſted againſt it. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th. was leſs a Friend to it. What Queen <hi>Mary</hi> would have done, I know not; But all the time of her Reign the Councel was under a Suſpenſion, and ſate not; And though it was Revived again in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, yet it is well known, that ſhe thought, that neither the Pope had Right to Call a Councel, nor equal that he ſhould Preſide in it; Neither did any of the Biſhops of her time, (either of thoſe put out, or thoſe put in) Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there. As for the Blind <hi>Iriſh-man,</hi> he is nothing to us, and as little I think to his own Nation. It is indeed true, that Cardinal <hi>Poole</hi> an <hi>Engliſb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> whom even Proteſtants Honour for his Moderation and Piety, was in that Councel ſome ſmall time under <hi>Paul</hi> the Third; But he Sate there as the Pope's Legat, not an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhop: Nay, at that time he was not a Biſhop, at leaſt not of any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, nor deputed by any Biſhop of Ours; And therefore could not Carry with Him the Authority of any one of our Churches. I wonder the Pope had not ſo much forecaſt, as to Set up ſome Titulars to ſupply this defect; But if He had, we ſhould have little Regarded ſuch a Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k-Authority. And as none of our Biſhops were there, ſo there is not the leaſt Colour to ſay, that we Received it ſince; And therefore they may Keep their Councel for a Snare to themſelves, it doth not bind us. And this Argument ought to be Held good, even in the Opinion of the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> it ſelf, for when in Order to Carrying a Matter under debate, the Determination of the Councel of <hi>Florence</hi> was urged, it was preſſed as an Argument againſt the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> not againſt the <hi>French;</hi> And for this Reaſon, that the one Nation had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Councel, but not the other. And thus I have done with the General Part, and now we muſt come to a more cloſe Fight, inſiſting upon ſuch Particulars, as may both Juſtify our Separation, and withal make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that whatever they pretend, the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
