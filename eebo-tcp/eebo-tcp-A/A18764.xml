            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Such is our weakenes of goodwill, and shortnes of breath,

            <p>Ye shal reade how the Romaines rewarded the valiancy of

And where such Souldiers (crowned in this manner) repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
either in open pastimes, priuace playes, and Comedies, or

altogether would arise from their seates of maiestie &amp; shewe a
certaine salutation towardes the honourable souldier, at his
comming to their presence, and further to animate couragious
mindes, there was alwayes an honourable place prepared (a
part from common people) for the souldier.</p>
            <p>Wherby the world might see the souldiers worthines, and
learne to regard men worthely, whose seruice deserued great
reputation.</p>
            <p>But looke now what great &amp; mighty matters were brought
to passe in that age, what victories were woonne, what try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs
were obtayned, and what riches and treasure was got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by the inuincible courage of meane, and by meane of the
honour that souldiers and citizens of Rome possessed.</p>
            <p>Among the East Indians at this present day, souldiers are
so reuerenced and made of, that the meane people muste not
onely giue them way &amp; curtesie, but also must labour for their
maintenance, yea their stipends and liuing are so greate (by a

treasure, and euery thing is allotted and appointed them,
as it came by inheritaunce, and were possessed from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes.</p>
            <p>Did not king Alexander the great, in the beginning and
middle of his conquests, cause souldiers to be honoured, made
orders and lawes that no man should doe them iniurie, &amp; since
his dayes as wel as before his time, when a souldier should be
iudged (by a free libertie graunted from kinges) he might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale
to Cesar from the lawes of the land, and so in euery sort
his priuiledge was so great, that al manner of men knew him
to be honourable.</p>
            <p>Though duty and good disposition halleth men forward, to
aduenture great attempts and seruices, if same should be kept
from them, their warme good willes woulde waxe colde, and
<pb facs="tcp:5360:6"/>
wearines would quickly ouercome the willingest mind, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
followed marshall affaires.</p>
            <p>For as the dumbe beast being cherished and comforted with
his maysters sweete entertainement, drawes (as seemeth)
with a better delighte in labour, and forsakes neyther foule

that otherwise would dragge farre behind, &amp; perswades
great content to an aspiring mind, that gapes after glory, and
is nourished with good hope.</p>
            <p>Nowe since in our elders dayes (of great antiquity) souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
had countenance and credite, that qualified their carefull
turmoylinges, and recompensed their labours, with a blast of
noble reporte, this our tyme presente muste of compulsion (by
meane of their prerogatiue) yeelde them praises condigne for
their deseruinges, and fit for personages of manly spirite and
towardnes.</p>
            <p>So if all nations &amp; times allow necessary fame to valiant
mindes, and reason graunts that good men should be honored,
(especially in a naughty world) because desire of fame breedes
many woorthy actions, wee may the better (and with greater
holdnesse) enterprise to register them in the renowmed booke
of commendation.</p>
            <p>All this before by me written, meante onely of souldiers,
that serue and haue serued agaynste forraine enemyes. Then
what Tytle, what honour shall I giue them? and what style
shall I holde in the honouring of those that continuallie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste
Rebelles, haue shewed theyr vttermoste force and
pollicye, whiche seruices of theirs, springes of maruellous
trueth and affection, and ought not to be forgotten of no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
nor nation: the consequent is so greate thereof, and
the constancie so muche in them, that pursues Rebelles,
<pb facs="tcp:5360:6"/>
that no mannes penne is able sufficientlie to prayse them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</p>
            <p>For they are suche profitable proppes and pillers of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

            <p>And so to be short, if conscience confesseeth that eche man
dooynge well, shall possesse immortall prayse, I may not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gette,
and vtterlye leaue out the noble. Actes and seruices of
mine auncient Friende the woorthye Earle of Ormounde,
whose deedes when you heare, (thoughe you were mortall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes)
you shal maruel of: and when you consider the
the substaunce thereof throughlye, you that haue power and
abilitie, shal imitate his steppes, and bee followers after the
light of so noble a lanterne, that in the darkest times, doubte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest
dayes, and most obscure season, hath shewed brightnesse,
and like a blasing starre hath stood stiffly in a fixed place, and
cast a cleere light, so farre, that al the beholders may be gladde
thereof, and wel therein.</p>
            <p>First, for that the Countrey of Irelande hath beene a long
whyle subiecte to sundrye seditions and sorrowful calamities
moste miserable for them selues, and chargeable to the
Prince, the reformation whereof hath coste manye a woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thye
mannes lyfe, and the greater hath growen the griefes
because diuers of that Nation neglecting their dueties, haue
hadde small care of the common tranquillitye and peace of
poore people, by which insolence, rebellion hath beene bredde:
and shamelesse dissention set abroche. And continuing in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitye,
verye sore woundes and maymes the publique
state hath sustayned, til GOD of his goodnesse raysed vppe
some suche members as sought nothing but redresse and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse.</p>
            <p>It happened in a number of seruices that one Noble
manne was so fortunate (because of his fideltye) that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye
of the reste didde feare him, and therefore soughte
<pb facs="tcp:5360:7"/>
his ouerthrow, but he being armed with a iust quarrel and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to scourge Rebels, omitted no occasion to take the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
at aduantage, but howsoeuer he chaunced to finde them,
he fortunately suppressed their pride, and followed the faithful
course and forme of a most noble captaine.</p>
            <p>And because it shalbe seene to the worlde, orderly what hee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did,
herein shal bee set downe the matter, place, and time, of a
part of his honourable seruices, to the intent it shall not dwell
in forgetfulnesse, and to encourage other noble personages in
doing their countrey good to treade the steppes of the noble
Earle of Ormound.</p>
            <p>I remembring his forwardnes in the young king Edwards
dayes (with whom he was brought vp) and the charge he had of
some horsemen in Queene Maries raigne against Rebels in
England, haue called in like manner to minde, the seruice hee
did against the Omoores and the Oconnors in their rebellion
of Ireland, also the ouerthrowing of Dunloghe, Oswilleuane
Moores chiefest house, is woorthie note: for it was in time of
Rebellion, with other ordinary seruices, that alwaies did testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
that this Earle was a sharpe scourge to Rebels.</p>
            <p>And to proue that his daily desire thirsted after noble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises
(for the punishment of malefactors) he serued char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geably
and in no little daunger (on his owne proper coste and
expence) with two hundred footemen, and fiftie horsemen in
Ulster, the North parte of Irelande against Iohn Oneale,
who was in open action of rebellion manie and sundrie sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
            <p>In the like manner all on his own charge, he serued against
the scot, called Iames Maconell, in Ulster, whose force he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrewe
to the number of two thousand men, and in the ende
droue the scot to flye away.</p>
            <p>Then hauing charge of Thomounde (by vertue of the
Queenes highnes commission) hee tooke all the Castles and
ho<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>es thereof in spite of the Earle of Thomounde (who was
in rebellion) slue diuers of his men, and brought others of them
to submission, compelling the Earle, himselfe (for safegarde of
<pb facs="tcp:5360:7"/>
his life) to flie into Fraunce, where hee remayned, vntill her
Maiestie on her meere clemencie, pardoned his life, and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his landes. The Earle of Thomoundes mother notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
was Aunt to the Earle of Ormounde, which shewes
that neither respect of blood, nor friendship could hinder any
peece of dutiful seruice.</p>
            <p>In another greate seruice the Earle of Ormound hearing
that Desmound went about to annoy Syr Maurice fitz Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralt
(late vicount of the Desies) he raised a power and mette
Desmounde in the fielde, gaue him battaile at Athmanie, slue
fiue hundred of his men, tooke himselfe captiue, and sente him
into England where he remayned till the Queenes highnesse
vouchesafed to remit his offence, and returned him home to
his countrey.</p>
            <p>Nowe in processe of time, my Lord of Ormounde by the
Queenes appointment, became gouernor of Mounster in the
beginning of Desmondes last reuolt, when hee had of Rebels
about him, two thousand able men, but he was folowed so fast,
and so hardly beset (by suche as were appointed for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose)
that he was driuen to manie extremities, partely by the
ayde and aduice of the L. Iustice, Syr William Pelham, and
partly by the policie and power of the Lord Gouernour (who
chiefly was general in the field) that of two thousand men, the
Desmound was left but one bare hundred, and as it seemed,
and may be prooued, the Earle of Ormounde was cause of the
weakening of the enemies force, as hereafter you maye reade,
when it comes to that point.</p>
            <p>But the L. Gouernour being remoued from that charge,
came into England, from whence after some time spent there,
about necessarie causes, he was sent againe to his former go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
of Mounster with most noble authoritie and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and being arriued in Irelande, he made heade against
the Desmound with whom was a thousand tall souldiers that
were gathered together in the absence of the Earle of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mound.
He comming to scourge these Rebels, and finding the
enemies force strong, tooke order both by watch, spial, disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyne
<pb facs="tcp:5360:8"/>
of Warre, and warlike deuises, to supplante Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moundes
determination, and marchinge in marshall manner
towardes the enemyes, his verye countenaunce daunted so
muche Desmoundes companye, that they fell to their woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
feare, where they thoughte them in moste safetye, but
beeynge painefullye followed, and pursued moste fiercelye
as Rebelles shoulde bee, they fell from flyinge and fightinge
to yeeldinge and crauinge of mercye, so euen as the matter
fell out in the pursuite, yee shall reade as followes the names
of some fewe of the chiefest that were slayne beeyng Leaders
of companies, and menne of accounte amongest the traytours.

confederates that were put to the sworde, and executed in such
manner as diuers other Rebelles (beeyng greatlye terrifled
therewith) were fayne to submit themselues to the Queenes
Highnesse mercie.</p>
            <p>And further, the Lord Gouernour caused al the Cattle of
the Countrie, to bee brought out of Desmoundes reache, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
places of strength, whereby Desmounde and suche of his
companye as remained with him, were brought to most mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
state, &amp; driuen for want of other relief, to feed vpon horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleshe
and carrion in suche sort as with very harde shifte, they
saued them selues from being sterued.</p>
            <p>And thus was the Earle of Desmound of al his force con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
and lefte accompanyed onelie with seuen menne and
his Priest, who from the tenthe of the laste Iulie, hidde them
<pb facs="tcp:5360:8"/>
in a glinne within Sleaueloghra, hauing no other foode the
space of seuen Weekes there, but sixe Plowegarrans, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they fedde without eyther breade, drinke, or other suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce.</p>
            <p>About the twentieth of September laste, Desmounde
beyng hardly followed by certaine Kearnes appoynted by the
L. General to serue against that traytour, his priest was taken
from him, with another of his men, and brought to the Earle
of Ormound.</p>
            <p>Since whiche time, the Earle of Desmounde was relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by a Captaine of Galloglas (called Gohorra mac Don<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagha
mac Sweenye) whereof the Earle of Ormounde ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
aduertisement by suche as hee imployed to doe that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
pursued hym into Olearies Countrie where hee tooke
the moste parte of his goodes, and lefte no reliefe for him
nor Desmounde, insomuche as the first of the laste Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
the sayde Gohorra was enforced to repayre to Iniskiue
mac Carthy Reoghs Countreye, in the Countye of Corcke,
and there tooke thyrteene Cowes and eyght Garrans from
one Donogho mac Teig of Iniskiue aforesaide Gentleman:
whiche Donnogho with tenne more in his companye made
pursuite after the sayde Gohorra, rescued his Cowes and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,
slewe the saide Rebell, and sent his head to the Earle of
Ormound.</p>
            <p>The eleuenth of the sayde Nouember, the Earle of Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounde
for wante of the sayde Gohorra, to brynge him hys
woonted nourishement was vrged with meere famyne, and
pinchinge penurye, to sende to one Daniel mac Daniell O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriherteighe
to seeke some reliefe, whiche Daniel made an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweare
to him that brought the message, that hee was bounde
in band, and by othe sworne to the Lord Generall, and also that
hee had deliuered his pledge into the Generalles handes for
performaunce of dooynge good seruice against Desmounde
and his Adherentes: wherefore, he would giue him no reliefe
at all.</p>
            <p>Wherupon the Earle (being almost famished with extreame
<pb facs="tcp:5360:9"/>
hunger) determined a desperate action. First, for relieuing his
necessitye, and after, to escape the daunger of other fortunes
that might followe, and in that resolution hee aduentured to
pray where he thought for that purpose, and because the verie
trueth of his doinges then, and the manner of his death shalbe
well knowen to the worlde throughly, heere is sette downe an
examination of one that was at his ouerthrowe, and sawe his

Desmound was pursued and slayne.</head>
            <p>THe said Owen being duely sworne and examined vppon
the holie Euangelist, by vertue of his othe, deposeth, that
on Saterday (beeing the ix. of this present Nouember) the
Earle of Desmound departed, the woods lying neere the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of Rierye, and went Westward beyond Tramore to the
wood called Dorremore neere Bongoinder, from whence he
sent ii. of his Horsmen (called Conoghore Nescolly &amp; Shane
Deleo) with xviii. kearns to bring him a pray (hauing himself
and Iohn mac Ullug, and two or three footmen stayed there at
Dorremore for them) which company (by the said Earles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection)
went to Cahir nefahye (lying by west Gregories Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
by the Sea side) and there tooke the pray of Maurice mac
Owen brother in law to this Deponent, and the pray of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
mac Edmound being Tenauntes to this deponent and to
his eldest brother, called Donil mac Donil Omoriherteighe
in that town: that is to say, forcie Cowes, niene capples with
great store of other goods and houshold stuffe, and stripped na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
the said Maurice his wife, and children. At the takinge of
whiche praye (to terrefie the people from making pursuit) the
said traytors published and saide that the Earle of Desmound
lay neere them with the rest of his companie, to ayde them, if
pursuite had beene made after them. Whereuppon the saide
Maurice sent worde to Liuetenant Stanley (then beeing in
the Dungle) and also to this deponent and to his sayd brother
Douil mac Donil (being then at Castle dromin neere Castle
Maing) of the taking of his pray.</p>
            <p>Whereuppon this Deponent and his said brother Donill
mac Donil (hauing also word sent them from Lieuetenaunt

tolde the Cunstable Cheston of the whole matter, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought

to followe the praye in the companie of him and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Daniel, to which Cheston aunsweared, that he could not
himselfe depart his charge, and saide, he woulde let him haue
some of his companie, to go with this Examinate, and so sent
away fiue Souldiers with him. This Examinate, and those
fiue Souldiers came together to the Mountayne of Slea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uemisse,
where his Brother Daniell mac Daniell wayted
for them, and from thence they came altogether toward Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
in the Euening a Sunday (beeing the tenth of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)
in hope that they shoulde ouertake the praye, before the
same, shoulde passe the straight of Tramore, where they were
sure (as they thought) to rescue the same praye from the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
if they had ouertaken them there. At their comminge to
Traley, they found the tracte of the pray, going Eastwarde
to Sleaueloghra.</p>
            <p>Whereuppon, the Souldiers whiche came from Castle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maing
beganne to stay, and sayde they woulde traueyle no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

him company to pursue the pray, promising them two biefes
of the pray if it had beene theyr lucke to rescue the same from
the Traytours, if not, that he woulde giue them a Biefe of

            <p>Whereunto this Examinate agreed. In the dawninge
of the daye, on mundaye the eleuenth of Nouember, they

seeynge the Traytours drewe verye neere to haue him rescu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Whereunto Daniel mac Daniel sayde, I will carry him

being at hand, al the companie refused to carry him any
further, considering the eminent danger they stood in the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
drawing neere.</p>
            <p>Where at this deponent Owen mac Donil willed the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
Daniel O kelleye, to cut off the Earles head, for that they
could not apply to fight and carry him away, to whose directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Kelley obeyed, saying: he would so doe, drawing out his

            <p>And the forenamed Daniel O kelley (being likewise exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

            <p>NOw may you that wishe wel to the worthye sort of men,

<pb facs="tcp:5360:11"/>
the worthie preserued, and briefly to rehearse the noble explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites
brought to good passe by the Earle of Ormound, it shall
make thousandes thinke, that a secrete deuine grace vpholds
the true subiect, and a prepared plague (from aboue) plucketh
downe the pryde of false people, that delights in paltry rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion:
for the good and sound quarrel, alwayes ouerthrowes the
ficke and charged conscience, as is seene by this seruice.</p>
            <p>First marke, this Earle serued against his owne nation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his owne blood, against his familiars, and against all
forreyne power and deuises, against whom often he obtained
victories, and neuer tooke foyle, where his Aduersaries were
conquered, and broughte to vtter subuersion. Truely a matter
to be maruelled at, and a terrible example to all those that foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishely
committe offence. For trueth is so watchful, so stoute
in right, and strong in battaile, that falshood can finde neyther
force nor cunning to auoyde and resist. This Irishe action &amp;
scourge of Rebelles, may warne the busie wittes and wanton
heades to beware of punishment, and make retchlesse children
feare the rodde. Which rodde and scourge, euery noble mind
beares openly and awfully, to make the miserable offender
quake and tremble, not onely at his owne treacherie, but also
at the view of a true mans face, which forceth a Rebel to blush
and turne backe vnto, and either mainely to run away or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to fight. Yea, and though a while the rebel waxeth wilde
&amp; wanders at pleasure. Yet sodainly he is made tame, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in a net like a wyld goose, that knowes of no danger, till
the fowler hath him in his fingers.</p>
            <p>Nowe by this notorious seruice of the Earle of Ormounde
(and forwardnesse of good souldiers) the whole realme of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
may see that trueth hath euer the victorie, and treason is
put to shame and dishonour, which iustice of God and fidelitye
of man shalbe I trust, a myrrour for al kind of nations to look

So thus farre I haue gone in the rehearsal of a portion of
the Earle of Ormoundes seruices, meaning to write more as
time permitteth me. And thus was the rather taken in hand &amp;
finished in haste, because your good Lordship shall see howe I
imploy mine aged yeeres. For the exercises of pen, and trauell
of body, makes me looke so young: And now to knit vppe my
careful pilgrimage, I frame my selfe daily to purchace noble
friends, whose power may further my good fortune here, and
yeeld some sparke of good reporte, when I am gone, and my
candle is cleane burned out, for which intent only I haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
your honourable Lordship this litle booke.</p>
            <p>A peece of forgetfulnes hath hindered my memorie, &amp; left out
a great matter which shold haue bin mentioned in order, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>g
the rest of this seuere Earles seruices, who as I haue sayd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
took no regard of blood, birth, friendship, familiarity, nor
personage whatsoeuer, when it came to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> point of iustice. For
in execution therof, all people were alike vnto him, were they
neuer so neere of his kin or consanguinity, as appeareth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the hanging of his owne base sonne, (and his Brothers
sonne) of late: with a number hanged likewise of their folow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which noble and seuere deede of his, as it is rare and most
to be marueiled at, so is it an act co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>parable to kinges, that spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
not their owne children in causes of punishment, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good example. And as the other his worthie doinges, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites
an euerlasting same: so this deserues a perpetuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne
and praise, as all iust men I knowe wil confesse. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as I saide, I forgate some matter, so the taking and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading
of Syr Iames of Desmound (which was when the
Earle of Ormound was Gouernour of Mounster) must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
for I mind at the length to bring most of al his good
actions to light.</p>
