            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>N.O.</hi> fouldyng vp this letter in his chamber, Mistresse <hi>Angelica</hi> one of <hi>A.O.</hi> hyr gentlewomen hauyng occasion to goe thorow his chamber, and seyng him foulding vp these verses, snatched them away from him, but with his consent, for he knewe she woulde as well shewe them vnto hir Mistresse, as his heauy cheare and sadde countenaunce vsed for the nonce, whiche was his whole desire. For if she had not thus vsed him, he would haue layed them in the place of his other verses, priuily stealyng away vntill such tyme as this cloude were ouercast: which in deede he did. For willyng the yong gentlewoman to remember hir mistresse of this phrase, <hi>Eate well of the Cresses,</hi> vnknowing to any in the house, he secretely wente his way. <hi>A.O.</hi> perceyuing the beginning of these morning verses to depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vpon the other poeticall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation, she perswaded hir selfe then that she perfectly knew the aucthor thereof. <hi>N.O.</hi> within a day or two after his suddaine departure (as most woers do, sparing no coste) sent many a precious &amp; costly iewell vnto his Lady in token of his great good will towarde hyr. But she nought regarding the coste (by reason as it shoulde seeme of the easie commyng thereby) neglected his giftes, saying: <hi>Eche birde can haue corne in the haruest tyme,</hi> meanyng thereby (as I thinke) that whyle she lyued in that order, shee coulde not wante what mighte so easily be commen by, what soeuer it coste. Wherevpon he remembryng the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which sometime shee sette vpon a rare and sumptuous iewell whiche <hi>Venus</hi> wore vpon hyr fronte, whose lyke for vertue was not to be founde agayne, and remembryng the common Prouerbe and vsuall experience, <hi>Farre fette and deare bought doe fansie Ladyes moste of all,</hi> he sought by all meanes possible that mighte be inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, some pretie deuice whereby to gette the same.

by fire. Where seyng the Goddesses most of all skuddelyng and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng to defende themselues longest from smothering, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought <hi>Diana</hi> vppon his knees, as shee loued hyr naturall daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to helpe him with the same. Who beyng moued with pittie, willed hym to goe vnto <hi>Venus,</hi> tellyng hyr that hyr temple is sette on fyre, and <hi>Cypres</hi> where shee was worshipped moste of all is consumed to naught, whereat (quoth she) shee will not onely rende hyr clothes, but also (neglectyng where) caste them here and there, whiche when you see hir doe, take the Iewell and goe your way. This precept lyked <hi>N.O.</hi> very well, who (doyng as she had commaunded him) founde eche thing to fall out in all respectes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng vnto hyr deuination before, wherefore he taking vp this Iewell, departed with great ioye and gladnesse, and sent it vnto his Lady for a token, who knowyng it at the firste sighte, receyued it ioyfully, although in the bryngers sighte but scornefully, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of hyr cloked countenaunce: for giuyng the seruaunt thankes, and rewardyng him liberally, shee sente his Master none at all. Thus eche man may see, though the louers purse be strung with the blade of a leeke, as the Poetes faine by <hi>Cupide</hi> dreaming of their to muche liberalitie, yet nothyng will please the froward mindes of their Ladyes, if affection beare not a stroke among them, or else the gifte be as hardly wonne as this. For <hi>Venus</hi> perceyuyng hyr Temple to stande, and the Ile of <hi>Cypres</hi> as yet vnwasted, and seyng the Father of <hi>Phaeton</hi> had taken vppon hym agayne the guydyng of the Sunne (at the earnest request of <hi>Iupiter</hi>) waxed very wrothe, with the misinformer of these things, sendyng <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> with a cuppe of all kynde of diseases to plague him for the same.

               </hi> vtterly refused. But <hi>Venus</hi> further perceyuing the Iewell where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of shee sette suche greate store, to be taken fro the place where shee flung hyr vpper garmentes, and knowyng well the bereauer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (for nothyng vnto the Goddes and Goddesses are vnknowne) she turned him for his suttlety in stealyng the same into a wylie Foxe.

Then fearing the discouery of hyr daughter for wearing the same: she changed not onely the colour, but also the propertie of the iewel, euen as it hanged on hir daughters fronte: So that dame <hi>Venus</hi> knewe not what was become thereof.

No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing she sayde of a long time: but yet the smothering fire at length breakes forth in flame. For she seing his long absence, and hearing in deede howe heauily he tooke the matter, greatly regardyng also his giftes in token wise, coulde not refrayne, but spent hyr dayes in sobbing sighes for woe, and beyng aboute somewhat to haue writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vnto him, whereby he mighte haue taken hartie grace, these verses following came vnto hir handes.</p>

of them would breake their heades (not a litle) to make full sense thereof. At the sight whereof all men mused, but none would take it in hande: at the length as an vnknowen Aucthor, he ended them thus:
<q>

Whereat three droppes of liuely bloudde fell downe from <hi>N.O.</hi> his nose, whiche (<hi>A.O.</hi> perceyuing) mistrusted thereby the Author: and meaning to discouer him in some secrete order (shee sayde) how cheare you (<hi>N O.</hi>) I see <hi>Apolloe</hi> sings, but not bewrayes his penne.

For (accordyng vnto my iudgement) well might they be so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, bicause (as yet) they are the first fruytes which my Muse hath yeelded. Notwithstanding, your Lordship knoweth right well, that of these Prymeroses and Uiolets, there be diuers and sundry kindes: whereof some are double, and some agayne are single: the double we see are peculiar to pryuate gardens, and become so double thorow theyr oft planting, but the single are wilde, and grow in the common fieldes: the one forte is farre more beautifull to the eye, and sweeter than the other. Whereof (moste Honorable) I counte these my Prymeroses to be of the worser and meaner sorte, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their firste plantyng. But if your Honor shall lyke well ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I do not double but that by oft mouing of them in their kindes, they may aspyre to some liuely sparkes of sauour, and become as double as the better sorte.

            <l>Sometime againe I wante, what is my hartes desire,</l>
            <l>Which as dry wood, and kindling coles, doth set my harte on fire.</l>
            <l>Then I to late repent my want on foolishe eye,</l>

            <p>NO foolishe fantasie through fonde affection, in this my sore faynting coulde I finde my (deare dame) to turne my payne to pleasure: wherefore, as one through stong with fierce <hi>Achid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> sting, requireth the second time to taste thereof, bicause playne proofe declares one poyson to driue forth an other: so I (as a foolish flie, who seing the bright flame of the candle, neuer linneth buzzing about the same till his wings are scortched with heate) perforce am constrayned willingly to enter the same, as a present remedie to mitigate my former grief.

But I (God knoweth) seeking this bathe at the Physitions hands was deceyued herein. For he (as it should seeme) delighting to see me pyne in payne, gaue me in steede hereof the iuyce of the hearbe <hi>Cresses</hi> whiche helpeth much the memory: which once perceyuing, I tolde it agayne to my former friende, who grieued thereat, tolde me moste comfortlesse there was no way for remedie but where I tooke my wounde.

Thou knowst right wel (my Diamond deare) that twice before this tyme I haue bene arraigned at dame <hi>Venus</hi> hir barre, in which arraignment (Lady) as guiltlesse I haue helde vp my hande, standing to your curtesie as one accused I know not whereof but for loyalty. Thus as a poore prysoner haue I helde vp my hande, answeryng at the iudges call, and appealyng to your curtesie onely for some sparke of grace.

Twise hope hath repreued me to appeale my chiefe dorrs herein, whiche as yet I woulde neuer. But the thirde time (in extremity of panges and dreadfull doubte of life) I am content. Braue beautie, demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, <hi>Cupid,</hi> and affection hath moued me herevnto. Loe, to thy demaund I haue yeelded, graunt therefore grace in tyme, else, I wishe not to liue but die. My gryping griefes would enioyne me to silence but that extremitie forceth me to speake: make answere therefore I pray thee to this demaunde, what should be the cause of the restrainte of your curtesie? as to base of byrth haue I cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to hie? then the greater my fall.

our wealth may incounter, vnlace therefore your loyaltie. But is there any mistrust of true meaning, constancie, greate good will or perfite loue? proofe declares this needed not, or thinke you extremity will cause me change? those mistrustfull handes of dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation doe but hinder your wittes of well thinking, and yet are no daynties for fine affection to feede vpon it so any curtesie rested in you. Wherefore thinke vpon my paineful pangs, and what I suffer for your sake, all is to little to gayne my wiche, and the least to muche to leese it. Graunt therefore with pittie what resteth to graunt, or else at the least in steede of a perfite yea, graunt but a weake denay. Then lingring hope wil perswade me, that where I tooke a deadly wound, there shall I finde a salue. Thus trusting to your vnknowne curtesie, wayling in woe and doubtfull of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse, I leaue you to likyng. And yet my constancie commendes me thine owne for aye.</p>

            <l>Of each delight, it doth a rangyng foote compell.</l>
            <l>For when the Aprill showers, descende with westerne windes,</l>
            <l>Each hearbe, ech floure, and plante, doe florish in their kindes.</l>
            <l>Each leafe vpon the tree, the grasse vpon the grounde,</l>

            <l>In euery bushe againe, the Primerose did appeere,</l>

               <pb facs="tcp:6088:67"/>Thus beyng set in counsell graue, this counsell did they giue,</l>

            <l>But yet for this they councellde me a wedded wife to take,</l>
            <l>That I the fishe of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sewer might whole and cleane forsake.</l>
            <l>I was content, my wittes did serue, and would me so to doe,</l>
            <l>To wiue I wente, as bootelesse bente, a goslyng for to shoe.</l>
            <l>For looke whose wife in beautie braue, doth passe the middle sorte,</l>
            <l>Each thinkes hir nought, a secrete whore, and giues hir this report.</l>
            <l>But further yet of wiues to speake, thus much I haue to say,</l>
            <l>Whose wife in welth hir mate exceedes, she then wil beare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sway,</l>
            <l>And treade vpon hir husbandes crowne, as for hir feete to lowe,</l>
            <l>Thou mightst haue beggde, this will she say (if so she be a shrowe)</l>
            <l>If not for me, thou knowest full well, thus will she beare the rule,</l>
            <l>And weare the breeches of hir mate, as wrapt in Friers cule.</l>
            <l>I did deserue a better man than euer thou wilt be,</l>
            <l>Why seekste thou then thy whole affayres or ought to hide fro me?</l>
            <l>Why should not I thy councell be, without restraint of will?</l>
            <l>So ought it be, and so it shall, till pleasure hath his fill.</l>
            <l>Then she disdayning of hir matche, some one will soone procure,</l>
            <l>To pay the boxe, and eke with salue, hir former wounde to cure.</l>
            <l>To Cuckoldes hall she will him sende, as warden for to be,</l>
            <l>With grifted hornes vpon his head, as euery one may see.</l>
            <l>Hir husbandes wealth shall wasted be, vpon hyr bilbowe boyes,</l>

            <l>Thus whiche way can a maried man at this day liue at ease,</l>
            <l>When neyther faire, the foule, nor riche, his fancy fond may please?</l>
