            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

was <hi>Beatrice</hi> who marryed <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Sauoy.</hi> The fourth
was <hi>Lodowike</hi> who (as it hath beene ſince founde) was ſecretlye
married to one <hi>Jolenta</hi> of honeſt parentage, &amp; of a ſingular beaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,
adorned with vertue and good quallities, by whome hee
had one onely ſonne, named <hi>Anthonie:</hi> (who is the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye,
of whome and concerning whoſe righte and tytle this
treatiſe principallye maketh mention). The fift childe of the
ſayde King <hi>Emanuell,</hi> was <hi>Ferdinando</hi> who married a daughter
of the Earle of <hi>Marialua</hi> in <hi>Portugall,</hi> by whome hee had two
ſonnes who dyed while their father and mother were lyuing.
The ſixte was <hi>Alfonſus</hi> who was made Cardinall and ſo dyed
without iſſue. The ſeuenth was <hi>Henrye</hi> who lykewiſe was
made Cardinall and prymate of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and after that King,
by the death of King <hi>Sebastian,</hi> as heereafter in this treatiſe more
at large ſhall bee declared. The eyght childe was <hi>Edwarde</hi>
who married <hi>Theodoſia</hi> Ducheſſe of <hi>Bergantia:</hi> by whome hee
had three children, that is to ſay, <hi>Mary</hi> who marryed <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> of whome are iſſued three children: alſo <hi>Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine</hi>
who marryed <hi>Iohn</hi> Duke of <hi>Bergantia.</hi> And <hi>Edwarde</hi>
who dyed vnmarryed. The ninthe chylde and laſte ſonne
of the ſayde King <hi>Emanuell</hi> of his ſayde ſeconde marryage was
<hi>Anthonie,</hi> who alſo dyed in his infancye. The thirde wyfe
of the ſame <hi>Emanuell</hi> was <hi>Eleonour</hi> ſiſter to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi>
the fifte, by whome he had two children, to wit, <hi>Charles,</hi> who
dyed in his infancie, and <hi>Marye</hi> who alſo deceaſed and was
neuer marryed. When the ſayde <hi>Emanuell</hi> was deceaſed,
<hi>Iohn</hi> the thyrde of that name, his eldeſt ſonne ſucceeded him
in the kingdome as is aforeſayde, who by <hi>Katherine</hi> his wife had
manye children the whiche dyed all in their infancyes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Prince <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Marye;</hi> The whiche <hi>Marye</hi> marryed
<hi>Phillip,</hi> nowe King, and then prince of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and dyed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her ſayde husbande came to his Crowne, leauing one

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:296:4"/>
thereof is conſtante) his father King <hi>Phillip</hi> commaunded to
bee put to death in pryſon. When Prynce <hi>Iohn</hi> came to the
age of ſixteene yeere, hee married <hi>Jane</hi> the daughter of the
ſayde Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> and dyed aboute one yeare after lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his wife greate with childe, who in the ſixte monethe after
the death of her huſbande, brought foorth a ſonne whoſe name
was <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> whiche yong Prince when hee came to aboute
the age of foure yeares, ſucceeded in the kingdome by and
after the death of the ſayde <hi>Iohn</hi> the thirde his Graundfather by
the fathers ſide.</p>
            <p>Now when King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> was come to the age of foure and
twentye yeares, vppon the intreatye and ſolicitation of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lei
Mahumet</hi> Kinge (as hee pretended) of Fez and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocos,</hi>
who by <hi>Mulei Maluco</hi> his brother was expelled and
driuen out of his kingdome, the ſayde King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> at the
laſt determined to paſſe into <hi>Affryca</hi> with a greate and puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Armye, to reſtore this <hi>Mulei Mahumet</hi> to his kingdome.
And for the better accompliſhmente thereof, hee prayed his
vncle King <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Caſtile</hi> to voutchſafe ſome ayde vnto him
in that beehalfe. The King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> graunting this petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
promiſed to ayde him, with fiftye Gallyes well appointed
and furniſhed, and foure thouſand armed ſouldyours. King
<hi>Sebaſtian</hi> truſting thereunto, with all care and dilligence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
his armye, wherewith in the monthe of Iune. 1578.
hee departed from <hi>Lisbone</hi> and came to a porte of <hi>Caſtile</hi> neere
the ſtreighte of <hi>Gibraltare</hi> called, <hi>el puerto de Sancta Maria,</hi>
where hee ſtayed certayne dayes for the Gallyes and menne
whiche the Kinge of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had promiſed to ſende vnto him.
But the Kinge of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> vnder pretence that the greate Turke,
prepared an Armye for that yeare, not onelye denyed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
his promiſe, but alſo (that is farre woorſe) cauſed a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
to bee made and publiſhed thorowoute all <hi>Spayne,</hi>
ſubiecte to his Iuriſdiction, whereby all his ſubiectes were
commaunded vppon greate pennalties that none of them
ſhoulde accompanye Kinge <hi>Sebastian</hi> in that Voyage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
certaynelye there can no other coniecture bee gathered,
ſauing onely that the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> by his vnmeſurable ambition
&amp; inſatiable deſire to haue dominion, neither coueted nor hoped
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:296:5"/>
for any other thing then onely that the yong prince king <hi>Sebaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
his nephew, for want of ſufficient force, ſhould be ouerthrown
and come to deſtruction in the ſame Iourney, ſo as thereupon the
ſaid king of <hi>Castile</hi> might by that meane haue oportunity to ioyne
the kingdome of <hi>Portugall</hi> to his kingdome of <hi>Caſtile</hi> as it came
to paſſe.</p>
            <p>Neuertheleſſe the ſaide king <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> being a prince of greate
magnanimitie, when hee had all thinges in a readineſſe, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
infinite expences vpon the furniſhing of this armie whiche
was aboue a thouſand Saile, determined to purſue his voyage, and
ariued in <hi>Affrica</hi> and there landed all his armie amounting to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
fifteene thouſand fighting men. Thereupon in the end hee
came into a plaine fielde whiche beareth the name of <hi>Alcazar,</hi>
where the fift day of Auguſt in the ſame yeare, was fought a great
and terrible battaile betweene him and the enemie, wherein the
ſaid yong king <hi>Sebastian</hi> was not onelye ouercome but alſo ſlaine
in the field together with <hi>Mulei Mahumet</hi> whoſe parte he tooke,
at what time neyther did <hi>Mulei Maluco</hi> the king that fought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them eſcape, For he, in the time of the battaile being ſicke
and wearye of ſitting his horſe, was remoued into his horſelitter
and there dyed during the battaile. A battaile certainlye worthie
to be had in remembraunce, for in the ſame dyed three kinges
together in one daye, as in lyke manner there were ſlaine in the
ſame aboue ſixe hundred of the cheefeſt of the Lordes and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the kingdome of <hi>Portugall</hi> beſides the common ſouldiers,
the moſt wherof were ſlaine in the battaile, and the reſt taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
amongſt whiche number <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> of whome this
booke ſpecially treateth was one of the Captiues. Further there
be certaine perſons who affirme, that after the death of the ſayde
king <hi>Maluco,</hi> there was found in his pocket a letter written vnto
him from king <hi>Phillip</hi> wherein he aſſured king <hi>Maluco,</hi> that king
<hi>Sebaſtian</hi> nephew of the ſaide king <hi>Phillip</hi> ſhounde haue no ayde
at his handes. whereby may be perceaued agreat vnfaithfullnes of
king <hi>Phillip</hi> againſt his owne blood.</p>
            <p>Now when as by the death of king <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> the linage of king
<hi>Iohn</hi> the third his grandfather by the fathers ſide, was vtterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct:
it muſt follow of neceſſity (if collateral ſucceſſion, take place
in this behalfe,) that recourſe muſt be had to the linage of the ſaid
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:296:5"/>
               <hi>Lodowike</hi> as ſeconde ſonne of the aforenamed king <hi>Emanuell.</hi>
Whiche <hi>Lodowike</hi> (as is afore aleaged) had one onelye ſonne
called, <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> who therefore (his lawfull byrthe preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed)
was the onelye lawfull and rightfull ſucceſſor of the
kingdome. But it fell ſo out, that while he in the ſaid diſcomfiture
of <hi>Affrica</hi> was taken priſoner and there remained captiue, (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
vnknowne of the enemie,) as it was alwaies before that tyme
vnknowne, yea and that alſo to <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> himſelfe, that hee
was the legittimate ſonne of the ſaid <hi>Lodowike: Henry</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
his vncle, the fift iſſue male of King <hi>Emanuell,</hi> was preferred to
the kingdom being then a very old man. within a little while after,
by a wonderfull meane, or rather by the prouidence of God, the
ſayd <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> about forty daies after the loſſe of the battaile,
was deliuered out of captiuitie, and returned into <hi>Portugall,</hi> where
he was with great ioy receaued, not onely by King <hi>Henry,</hi> but alſo
by all the nobilitie and principall gentlemen of the countrey, and
moſt chiefly and principally by the common people. For hee was
beloued of all men, as well in reſpect of his noble and excellent
diſpoſition of mynde, as for the ſingular and rare vertues of his
ſayde Father <hi>Lodowike</hi> which moſt cleerely ſhined in him.</p>
            <p>Within a fewe dayes after <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was arriued at <hi>Lyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi>
the metropolitan Citie of the kingdome, he was aduertiſed
by one of his father <hi>Lodwikes</hi> ancient ſeruantes who was a man
of good callinge and approued integritie, that his father <hi>Lodowicke</hi>
(as is afore mencioned in this treatiſe) was ſecretlye married to
the ſaid <hi>Iolenta.</hi> And howe there were diuerſe credible witneſſes
yet liuinge that could teſtifie the trouthe therof. And beſides that
dyuerſe men of good credit &amp; calling, had expreſſed and declared
the ſame by their laſt willes and teſtamentes for the diſcharge of
their conſciences notwithſtanding that it was alwaies kept verye
ſecret through the endeuour of the ſaid <hi>Lodowike</hi> aſwel in reſpect
of thine quallitye of the perſons, as alſo for that the publiſhinge
thereof was not materiall at that time, for that <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was
brought vp to be a Prieſt and Churchman and for that alſo there
were then many other heyres of the kingdom that were nearer to
the Crowne then he. When <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> had receaued the
ſame aduertiſement, he opened the matter to King <hi>Henry</hi> his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
and beſought him to voutchſafe the examitation thereof, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:296:6"/>
to graunte that hee might produce certaine witneſſes and poofes
whereby the truth of the matter myght bee founde oute and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtlye
knowne, for the auoydinge of all controuerſies and
warres which otherwiſe were lyke to ariſe betweene them who
after the death of the ſayde Kinge <hi>Henry</hi> myghte pretende Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to the kingdome. For ſithe hee was the onelye ſonne of
the ſayde <hi>Lodowike</hi> ſeconde ſonne of the ſayde Kinge <hi>Emanu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi>
(if his byrth bee prooued to bee legittimate) hee neceſſarilye
excluded and barred all others that by tytle of conſanguinitye
myghte aſpyre or pretende tytle to the ſucceſſion of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
notwithſtanding there were anye of the children liuing
who were beegotten of the daughter of the ſayde Kynge <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuell,</hi>
which was elder then the ſayde <hi>Lodowike</hi> her brother, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuche
as the kingdome of <hi>Portugall</hi> falleth not by ſucceſſion
to the woman nor anye other deſcending of her.</p>
            <p>When Kynge <hi>Henrye</hi> had vnderſtandinge thereof beeing
a verye olde manne (as afore is aleaged) and fearing leaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſhoulde (in caſe Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> were proued to bee borne
in lawfull marriage) bee depriued of his kingdome, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
ſo greate indignation thereat, that immediatlye hee
banniſhed Don <hi>Anthonio,</hi> Thirtye myles from his courte, with
expreſſe commaundemente that hee ſhoulde not preſume to
retourne thither vntill his Maieſtye ſhoulde take further order in
that behalfe. Thereuppon Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> yeilding his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the ſame commaundemente made his repayre to the
Cytie of <hi>Columbria</hi> being foure and thyrtie myles from <hi>Lysbone</hi>
where at that tyme Kinge <hi>Henry</hi> kepte his Courte. But yet
neuertheleſſe the ſayd Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> lefte at Lisbone, the
ſayde auntient ſeruaunte of his fathers, from whome hee had
receaued the ſayde aduertiſemente, who at the ſame tyme was
in the ſeruice of the ſayde Kinge <hi>Henry</hi> and verye farre in his
fauoure. To this man, the ſayd Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting
from Lisbone, gaue a ſpeciall charge, to ſollycite
his cauſe to the Kinge in his abſence with all endeuoure and
diligence. The which the ſame Miniſter promiſed with all fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitye
to accompliſhe, and made humble petition to Kinge
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:296:6"/>
               <hi>Henry,</hi> that with his good fauour and lycence, hee might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute
the affayres of the ſayde Don <hi>Anthonio.</hi> Whiche
the Kinge not onelye graunted, but alſo expreſſely commaunded
him ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>When the ſaid Agent had receaued this aunſwere of the King,
he required Emanuell Biſhop of <hi>Almada,</hi> then conſeruator of
the priuileges of the order of the Knights of ſaint <hi>Iohn</hi> at <hi>Thiſle</hi> of
<hi>Malta,</hi> competent Iudge, of the ſayde Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> as prior of
<hi>Crato</hi> of the ſame order: To receaue and heare the depoſitions of
witneſſes and certain documents and inſtruments wherby the ſaid
Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> intended to verifie and proue himſelf to be iſſued of
a lawfull marriage: praying the ſayd Biſhop neuertheleſſe to keepe
the matter very ſecrete leaſt the King by vnderſtanding the ſame
ſhoulde conceaue ſome newe diſpleaſure. Whereuppon the
ſayde Byſhoppe proceeded in the examination of the cauſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whome were produced three witneſſes, who perfectlye &amp;
with lawfull circumſtaunces depoſed that they were preſent at
the celebration of Marriage betweene the ſayde <hi>Lodowike</hi> and
<hi>Iolenta</hi> parentes of the ſayd Don <hi>Anthonio.</hi> Alſo there was
broughte and produced beefore the ſayde conſeruatour, the
Teſtament of one <hi>Rui Celema,</hi> who while hee liued was knowne
to bee a verye honeſt credible man, of approued integritie,
and was ſeruaunte to Don <hi>Anthonios</hi> Father and in good eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
not only with him but alſo with King <hi>Henry.</hi> This <hi>Rui Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lema</hi>
by his teſtament had declared that he alwaies vnderſtood &amp;
certaynelye knewe, that the ſayde <hi>Lodowike</hi> Father of Don
<hi>Anthonio</hi> was ſecretlye marryed to <hi>Jolenta,</hi> ſetting downe
therewithall diuerſe reaſons whiche ſufficyentlye prooue the
ſame, and bycauſe hee was at poynte of death, and for
that in tyme to comeit myghte bee expediente and beehouefull
to the common wealth of the kingdome of <hi>Portugall</hi> to
knowe that Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> was iſſued of a lawfull marryage,
therefore and for the diſcharge of his conſcience, hee had
made true declaration thereof in his ſayde Teſtamente.
There was alſo exhibited before the ſayde Byſhop, the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the ſayd <hi>Lodowike</hi> wherby he ordeined and appointed the

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:296:7"/>
Patrimoniall, but alſo in certaine patronall rightes of greate im-Portance
which were lefte vnto the ſaide <hi>Lodowike</hi> by the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his brother <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and his wife who (as is aforeſaide)
dyed without children. Further there were produced before the
ſayde Biſhop other witneſſes of good calling and credite, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that King <hi>John</hi> the third of that name, immediatlye after the
death of the ſayd <hi>Lodowike</hi> his brother, gaue vnto <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi>
the ſignet and Armes of his father commaunding him to vſe the
ſame frankly and freely without barre or breach, in as ample man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as his ſayd father had the vſe thereof, as the ſayd <hi>Don Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio</hi>
hath alwayes ſince accordingly done. Vppon the proofe of
all theſe thinges, the ſayd Biſhop taking vnto himſelfe certaine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Iudges of the ſame order gaue ſentence touching the ſame
matter: whereby it was pronounced and declared, that the ſayde
<hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was the lawfull ſonne of the ſaid <hi>Lodowike</hi> and <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenta,</hi>
the which ſentence was alſo pronounced and confirmed in
the Chauncerie of the ſaide order, howbeit ſecretly for the cauſe

            <p>In the meane tyme, King <hi>Henry,</hi> aſſembleth the eſtates of his

<hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> not to come to the ſaid aſſembly but to ſend ſome
deputie or agent that might repreſent his perſon there. Alſo the
ſame king <hi>Henry</hi> being very fearefull leaſt <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> ſhould
proue himſelfe to be legittimate, required the Pope of Roome to
voutchſafe to commit vnto him the hearing and examination of

aſſembly of theſtates all ſuch right and tytle as euery of them after
his death could pretend to the ſayd kingdome. Saying hee was
minded to determine the ſame cauſe in his lyfe time if poſſibly he
could bring it to paſſe. But if death ſhoulde preuent his purpoſe
therein, his meaning was to commit and appoint not onelye cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
perſons to gouerne the kingdome, but alſo certaine Iudges
to determine who had beſt right, and title to ſucceede &amp; enioy the
crowne, alleaging he tooke that courſe, to auoide all controuerſies

            <p>Whereuppon all the ſayde princes and potentates thus lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

kingdome, Except onely <hi>Phillip</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> who anſwered, he
neyther had, nor acknoledged and Iudge in earth, but onelye in
heauen. And therfore woulde not commit his righte and tytle to
the determination of any Iudges that ſhoulde bee appointed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that matter, adding withall howe hee was ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by his beſt learned lawyers in his owne kingdome, that
there was no other perſonage in the world ſauing onely himſelfe
that had lawfull right to ſucceede in the ſayde kingdome of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall</hi>
after the death of the ſayde King <hi>Henry,</hi> which right in caſe
it ſhoulde be denyed vnto him, that then hee woulde obtaine the

            <p>When the moſt excellent prynceſſe <hi>Katherine de Medicis</hi> the

legittimate daughter of the ſaide King <hi>Alfonſus.</hi> Whereuppon
there grew ſharpe warre betweene the ſame two Kinges concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
that matter, wherein the Kinge of <hi>Caſtile</hi> in thende was
ouerthrowne in battayle, aboute a certaine towne of <hi>Portugall</hi>
called <hi>Algibarotta.</hi> Moreouer that the ſame people had cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:296:8"/>
their King, <hi>Emanuell</hi> the firſt, for that King <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſecond
had lefte no iſſue male deſcending of the righte Maſculyne lyne.
Laſtlye that they had made the ſayde Cardinall <hi>Henry</hi> their King
after the deceaſe of Kinge <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> who was ſlayne in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle
of <hi>Affrica</hi> leauing no lawfull iſſue of his body to enioy the
Crowne. By all theſe reaſons the ſayde people concluded, that
their power and righte to make the ſayde election, was offarre
greater force and effecte, then the righte and tytle of ſucceſſion,
whereuppon the other pretenders grounded them ſelues, and
the ſame people added withall, that by the Lawe, called the
mentall Lawe, made by the ſayde Kinge <hi>Iohn</hi> the firſte of that
name, no woman can nor oughte to inherite anye goodes or
poſſeſſions depending of the Crowne, and therefore neyther
myghte they who deſcended of the iſſues female as all the
ſayde pretenders did, ſauing onely the ſayd Don <hi>Anthonio.</hi> Vpon
thunderſtanding of all theſe matters ſo propounded and ſet down
on the beehalfe of the people, Kinge <hi>Henrye</hi> lykewiſe admitted
their plea.</p>
            <p>Hereuppon whyle the ſtates of the Kingdome of <hi>Portugall</hi> were
aſſembled treating vppon the nomination and election aſwell of
thoſe perſons whiche after the death of the ſayde Kinge <hi>Henrye</hi>
ſhould haue the adminiſtration and gouernement of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
as alſo of ſuche as ſhoulde decyde and iudge the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
and controuerſie touchyng the ſucceſſion of the crowne,
Thagent of Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> was informed that one <hi>Alphonſus</hi> of
<hi>Alburquerque</hi> an aduocate of the Cytye of <hi>Lysbone</hi> was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crned
and wonne by ſome of the King of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> fautors, and
that hee had manifeſtlye declared his aduiſe and opinion to
certayne greate menne of the kingdome whereby it euidentlye
appeared that hee was altogether bent and enclyned to the
King of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> parte. Wherefore the ſame Agent propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and put in againſte the ſame <hi>Alfonſus</hi> a plea or byll of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
to thintent hee ſhoulde haue no voyce in thelection
neyther of the ſayde adminiſtrators or gouernours of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
nor of the Iudges that ſhould haue the hearing and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the cauſe touching the ſucceſſion of the crowne, &amp; alſo
the ſame Agente auoutched how hee woulde declare ſufficiente
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:296:9"/>
cauſes that mooued him to make the ſayde recuſation in caſe the
ſayde <hi>Alfonſus</hi> woulde not admit the ſame. Whereat the ſayde
<hi>Alfonſus</hi> conceaued greate diſpleaſure and made greeuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
thereof to certayne ſpeciall men that fauoured the Kinge
of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> parte, at whoſe handes hee obtayned ſo muche fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
that they went with him to king <hi>Henry,</hi> to whome they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
this matter as they thought moſt fit for their owne purpoſe,
alleging vnto his maieſtie that Don <hi>Anthonios</hi> Agent had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
this ſcruple of recuſation for no other intent but onelye
to hinder and diuerte thelection of the ſayde Iudges for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> after the death of the ſayde king <hi>Henry</hi>
might with the more facillitye attayne to the kingdome. This
complaint wrought ſo effectually in the minde of the ſayde kinge
<hi>Henry,</hi> that forthwith without hearing the ſaide Agent in his anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were
and defence touching the ſame he commaunded him to be
caſt into cloſe priſon where he was deteined by the ſpace of nine
daies vntill the ſayde Gouernors and Iudges were ordeyned and
eſtabliſhed according to the kinges will and minde. Vppon the
accompliſhment wherof, king <hi>Henry</hi> cauſed the ſayd Agent to be
deliuered out of the priſon where he remained, commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding him
neuertheleſſe immediatlye to repaire home to his owne houſe, and
not to returne to the Court, without his Maieſties ſpeciall licence.
Whereby the ſame king moſt manifeſtlye vttered his extreme ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
againſt the ſaide <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> beeing his owne nephewe,
ſith before that tyme (as is before alleaged in this treatiſe) he had
giuen his conſent to the ſaide Agent, yea and expreſly commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him freelye to proſecute the cauſe of the ſayde <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within a while after: the kinge commaunded <hi>Don Anthonio</hi>
then remayning at <hi>Colimbre,</hi> to repayre to his Maieſtie to <hi>Lisbone</hi>
to take an oath to obey the Iudgement, that ſhould be giuen, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the righte of the Crowne, by the Iudges in that behalfe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted.
Affirming that the other pretenders woulde doe the like,
by themſelues their Ambaſſadors or agentes. Vppon this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement,
<hi>Don Anthonio</hi> came to the king, and when the ſaid
oath was offered vnto him he aunſwered he was ready to take the
ſame in caſe the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> would doe the lyke, but if hee refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
it there was no reaſon why eyther the ſayde <hi>Don Anthonio</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:296:9"/>
or any of the other pretenders ſhould bee conſtrained thereunto.
Notwithſtanding kinge <hi>Henry</hi> perſiſted and in greate rage com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
him to take his oath, in ſo much that in thend he did ſo,
with this proteſtation firſte made in the preſence of certaine of his
friendes, that hee tooke not the ſame oathe with a franke and free
will but by compulſion and commaundement of the king.</p>
            <p>The next day after, <hi>Don Antonio</hi> had taken this oath, king <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
cauſed the Popes letters pattents to be ſhewed vnto him wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the ſame <hi>Henry</hi> was conſtituted to take notyce and informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the cauſe touching <hi>Don Anthonios</hi> legittimation, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uppon
commaunded him to appointe his procurer to pleade his
cauſe before his maieſty as iudge. And that yet neuertheles, within
foure and twentye houres the ſayde <hi>Anthonie</hi> ſhoulde departe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
thirtie miles from the Courte. Whereunto <hi>Don Anthonio</hi>
anſwered that the King coulde not bee Iudge in the cauſe for two
reaſons: thone for that he was partie himſelfe, thother for that
in his former actions hee had plain elye ſhewed a great hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, alleaging a freſh example thereof, in that the ſaid King
<hi>Henry</hi> had lately before impriſoned his Agent, for proſecuting his
cauſe as he thought conuenient by order of lawe: And that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he doubted he coulde not finde any other that would take vp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pon
him to purſue and follow his buſines. Vppon this aunſwere,
the king with all expedicion ſendeth woorde to the ſayde Agent
that hee might freely come to the courte and proſecute the cauſe
of <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> denying expreſly, that himſelfe was partie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and therefore ſignifying how his will and meaning was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
therein, yea and that he woulde proceede againſt the ſayde
<hi>Anthonie</hi> as contumax for defaulte of anſwere in caſe he refuſed
to pleade his cauſe before him &amp; to informe him therin as ſhould
be meete and conuenient. Wherefore King <hi>Henry</hi> graunted vnto
the ſayde Agent his lybertye and commaunded him to proſecute
<hi>Don Anthonios</hi> cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now when the ſaide agent was returned to the Court, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one of the kinges confeſſors, to be a meane to his maieſtie, that
ſyth he was by the kinges commaundement vrged to take vppon
him the proſecution of Don <hi>Anthonies,</hi> cauſe, he might therefore
freely employ and endeuoure himſelfe in the ſame as hee ſhoulde
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:296:10"/>
thinke to bee moſte meete and conuenient for the ſafegarde and
preſeruation of his mayſters righte and tytle. And that his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie
woulde neyther bee diſpleaſed nor take in euill parte if he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in the ſame ſorte that hee did when (as is afore recyted in
this treatyſe) hee ſoughte to remooue the ſayde <hi>Alphonsus</hi> of
<hi>Alburquerque</hi> as a perſon ſuſpected. But if hee myghte not
proſecute the cauſe freelye as appertayned, then hee beſought
his maieſtie to voutcheſafe to diſcharge him of that burden and
to graunt him lycence to returne agayne to his owne houſe where
he dwelt when King <hi>Henry</hi> commaunded him to bee ſente for to
take the charge and adminiſtration of thoſe goodes whiche Don
<hi>Anthony</hi> poſſeſſed in <hi>Portugall</hi> when he remayned in <hi>Aphrica.</hi>
When the Kinge was aduertiſed hereof, his maieſtie gaue in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement
agayne to this Agent to proſecute this cauſe freely
before him in as good and ample ſorte as he ſhould thinke moſte
behouefull.</p>
            <p>When Don <hi>Anthonie</hi> ſawe himſelfe thus preſſed to pleade his
cauſe before the king &amp; that his maieſtie purpoſed to giue ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
againſt him for default of anſwere, he commaunded his Agent to
nominate the witneſſes which were there at hand proteſting hee
had yet further proofes to produce, whereuppon hauing giuen
perfect inſtructions to his Agent, Don <hi>Anthonie</hi> departed from the
Court within the tyme appointed by the king. Then the king com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth
thoſe three witneſſes to bee called before him whiche
were produced before thaforeſaid Biſhop and conſeruatour of the
priuileges of thorder of the knights of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> at <hi>Malta,</hi> Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come before the king perſiſted in their former depoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s made
before the ſaide conſeruator, to wit, that they were preſente when
marriage was ſecretly celebrated betweene the ſaide <hi>Lodowike</hi> &amp;
<hi>Jolenta.</hi> The king vppon the hearing thereof, vſed great threatning
ſpeeches vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſaying he would cauſe them al three to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in caſe they would not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their oaths confes, they were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
by promiſes and otherwiſe, by Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> or ſome other in his
behalfe, to giue thaforemencioned teſtimony before the conſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
And when two of thoſe witneſſes affirmed that no bodie had
induced or perſwaded them thereunto, and that their depoſition
therein was according to the plaine and ſimple trueth, the Kinge
cauſed them to be committed to priſon, and the thirde witnes for
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:296:10"/>
feare reuoked part of his former depoſition ſaying he was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
when the ſaid marriage was priuily had &amp; concluded, but the
truth was, hee had hearde it by reporte of others by reaſon hee was
houſhold ſeruant to <hi>Iolentaes</hi> parents. The King by reaſon thereof
was mooued immediately to ſent for all the Actes, depoſitions of
witneſſes &amp; inſtruments exhibited on the behalfe of <hi>Don Anthonio</hi>
before the ſaid Biſhop and conſeruator to proue his matter, togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce giuen thereupon, al the which being brought
before him he cauſed to bee caſt into the fire, &amp; would not admit
any other witneſſes &amp; profes which the ſaid Agent offered yet fur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
to produce in the ſame cauſe amongſt the which were diuerſe
religious men of good calling who had bin confeſſors to the ſaide
<hi>Lodowike,</hi> beſides diuers other witneſſes of good credite &amp; eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
Howbeit the king contemning and reiecting all the ſame,
contrary to all order of law gaue ſentence whereby he pronounced
the former ſentence before giuen by the ſaid biſhop and conſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to be void &amp; of no force or effect. And thereuppon gaue order
to the high marſhal of the kingdom called <hi>Edward de Caſtle</hi> bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co
(whom ſince the Kinge of <hi>Caſtile</hi> hath made one of the chiefe
Treaſorers of the kingdom) that he ſhould binde and bring Don
<hi>Anthonio</hi> to the Courte as Captiue &amp; priſoner, and commaunded
that the two witneſſes which remained priſoners ſhould be banni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
but contrariwiſe, greatly rewarded him that had altered his
depoſition grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting vnto him a croſſado of the knights of thorder
of Saint Iames withall the rent and reuenues thereunto appertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
but <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> beeing in due time aduertiſed of all theſe
things remooued immediately from the Cytie of <hi>Colymbre,</hi> ſo that
the marſhall came thither in vaine &amp; ſo retourned to <hi>Lisbone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Aſſoone as the ſaid ſentence was giuen <hi>Don Anthonies</hi> Agent,
ſent a ſupplycation to the byſhoppe of Rome, complayning of the
great iniuſtice done to <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> by the king, beſeeching the
ſaid biſhop to voutchſafe his ayde to <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> by remedy of
lawe againſte that ſentence ſo wickedly giuen, and alſo to inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
the Kinge that by force of the ſame hee ſhoulde proceede no
further nor execute any thing againſt the ſayd <hi>Don Anthonie.</hi> Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the exhibiting of this ſupplication, the Pope with all expedici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cauſed his letters pattents to bee diſpatched whereby hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the ſayde ſentence of Kinge <hi>Henry</hi> to be altogether voyde
and of no force, moſt ſpecially for that he had raſhly proceeded to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:296:11"/>
to ſentence diffinitiue, withoute commiſſion or authoritie, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the former letters by vertue whereof he proceeded againſt
the ſayde <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> conteyned no other matter ſauing onely
that hee might heare and examine all the witneſſes, and receaue
therewithall all inſtrumentes and ſuche like thinges whereby <hi>Don
Anthonio</hi> ment to prooue his cauſe, and that vpon the hearing of
the witneſſes, and the cauſe duly pleaded, all the actes inſtruments
and proofes ſhould be ſent to the ſayde Biſhop of Roome that hee
mighte Iudge and determine of the ſame as hee ſhoulde thinke
to bee moſt conuenient. Expreſly commaunding the ſayde Kinge
<hi>Henry</hi> to proceede no further nor attempt any thing againſt Don
<hi>Anthonies</hi> perſon by vertu of the ſaid ſentence giuen againſt him
by the ſame kinge <hi>Henrye,</hi> but to ſende vnto the Pope all thactes
inſtruments, and proofes produced before king <hi>Henry</hi> on the bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe
of <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> to thintent the cauſe mighte bee deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and Iudged by the Pope himſelfe or ſuch Iudges as he ſhould
appoint. When theſe letters were by the Popes legate denounced
to king <hi>Henry:</hi> immediately theruppon the ſame kinge comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Don Anthonies</hi> Agent, within ten dayes, vpon payne of death
to departe out of his kingdome, bycauſe the king vnderſtoode the
Popes letters were obtained through his induſtrie and and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
by reaſon whereof the ſame Agent vppon this commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demente
departed preſentlye from <hi>Lysbone</hi> to a monaſterie of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi>
adioyning to the borders of the kingdome of <hi>Portugall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe when king <hi>Henry,</hi> by reaſon of the Popes inhibition,
could proceed no further, nor attempt any thing againſt Don <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hony</hi>
by vertue of the ſaid ſentence: he determined to take anot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her
courſe for thexecution of his rancour againſt him. Wherupon,
vnder pretence and coloure that <hi>Don Anthony</hi> had come within
ſix miles of his Court contrary to his commaundement, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
him likewiſe uppon paine of death to depart oute of his
kingdome within fifteene dayes, declaring and decreeing with all
that by the ſame occaſion he had forfaited all his right whiche he
pretended to the kingdome, commaunding moreouer that none
of Don <hi>Anthonies</hi> ſeruants vpon paine of death ſhould attend &amp;
ſerue their maiſter in that extremitie. This moſt hard and rigorous
ſentence he preſently cauſed to be ſignified to Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> then
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:296:11"/>
being at the ſaide towne of <hi>Colimbre,</hi> whereof when the Burgeſſes
of the towne, and chiefelye the ſchollers of thuniuerſitie there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whome remained many of the nobilitye, were aduertiſed,
there aroſe ſuch trouble that they put them ſelues in armes, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
euery where in the towne, howe King <hi>Henry</hi> doting with age
and mooued with hatred againſt <hi>Don Anthonie,</hi> would deliuer the
kingdome of <hi>Portugall</hi> into thandes of the Kinge of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and
for the ſame occaſion, had giuen this rigorouſe ſentence againſt
him, Wherefore they would not ſuffer him in this manner to bee
expelled out of the kingdome. Offering themſelues to bee his
valiaunt and faithfull defenders herein, and ready to ſpende their
lyues and goodes for his ſafetye. Neuertheleſſe <hi>Don Anthonio</hi>
not mynding to ſtirre vppe anye tumulte in the Realme for his
cauſe, gaue greate thankes to the multitude for their readye
good will and affection towarde him, deſiring them to pacifie
and content themſelues. For hee was wholy determined to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the kinges commaundement, in hope that when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtye
had better weighed the matter, hee woulde at the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
the ſame ſentence, whereuppon hauing by this meane
pacified the tumulte and diſmiſſed thaſſemblye, hee departed
towarde the kingdome of <hi>Castile,</hi> and wente to the ſame place
whither his Agent within a fewe dayes beefore was gone, whiche
was a monaſterie of <hi>Franciſcan Fryers</hi> diſtant one myle from the
towne of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alentia</hi> of <hi>Alcantara.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> vnderſtoode of <hi>Don Anthonioes</hi> ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
out of <hi>Portugall,</hi> hee ſent letters forthwith to all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours,
Maiors, and other highe officers of his townes, Caſtles
Borowghes and Villages bordering towarde <hi>Portugall,</hi> to ſhewe
vnto him in caſe he reſorted thither all manner of courteſie and
honorable entertainmente, but yet neuertheleſſe to take heede
and haue ſpeciall regarde, that he retourned no more into <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall.</hi>
Thereuppon the ſaide Agent vppon aduertiſemente to him
thereof giuen, required a ſpecyall friende of his then remayning
in <hi>Portugall</hi> neere the confines of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> to ſpye oute in thoſe
quarters ſome ſecrete place farre from the common paſſages,
where <hi>Don Anthonie</hi> might ſaelye remayne for a certaine ſpace.
In the meane while when thagent vnderſtoode what daye <hi>Don
Anthonie</hi> woulde come to the monaſterie, hee cauſed a notarie of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:296:12"/>
the ſaide towne of <hi>Valentia</hi> to come thither the very ſame day, by
whome aſſoone as <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was come, hee cauſed a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificat
or teſtimoniall to bee made wherein was conteined that he
was then come to the ſayd monaſtery, cauſing the ſame teſtimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
for the better credite of the matter to be ſubſcribed by the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
religious perſons of the ſayde monaſterye. This inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thagent ſent forthwith to tharchbiſhop of <hi>Lisbon</hi> to be ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed

<hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was alreadye departed from thence for thaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhmente
of a pilgrimage which he had vowed to make when
hee was captiue in <hi>Aphrica.</hi> But contrariwiſe <hi>Don Anthonio</hi>
diſmiſſing a greate parte of his traine which hee had brought thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
wente the ſame daye accompanyed with his Agente and
onelye two ſeruauntes to the ſecret place prepared for him, where
hee contynued the ſpace of about twentye dayes, but his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gente
in the meane while returned preſentlye to the ſayde Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſterye.</p>
            <p>Within fewe dayes after: letters were brought to the ſaide A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
wherein certaine of <hi>Don Anthonios</hi> friendes wrote, that it
was not conuenient for <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> to abſent himſelfe far from
the Court, leaſt after King <hi>Henryes</hi> death (who was verye ſickelye
and full of infirmities) the people ſhoulde bee mooued to chooſe
the Duke of <hi>Bergantia</hi> for Kinge. For as touching the Kinge of
<hi>Caſtile</hi> hee was to bee feared in no reſpecte ſauing onelye thinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

King <hi>Henry</hi> had in all places appointed ſpyes, and likewiſe the
Duke of <hi>Bergantia,</hi> and the Kinge of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> Ambaſſadours, who
made dilligent ſearche whether <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> ſtayed ſecretlye

by vertue of that latter and moſt rigorous ſentence giuen againſt

that <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> by the ſpace of certayne dayes
mighte bee kepte ſecrete in the ſame vppon the ſayde Ryuer

            <p>Aboute the ſame time or ſhortlye after, the Kinge of <hi>Caſtile</hi>
ſent a gentleman of good calling to the ſayde Agent, to the

Anthonio,</hi> to compounde with him touchinge the controuerſie
that was lyke to aryſe beetweene them aboute the ſucceſſion of
the kingdome, and for the better bringing to paſſe thereof, the
ſame gentleman required the ſayde Agent to goe with him to
<hi>Madril</hi> to the Kinge of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> But thagente ſuſpecting all
that was propounded on the Kinge of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> behalfe, aunſwered
howe the ſame courſe was not in any reſpecte conueniente for
the King of <hi>Castile</hi> himſelfe, aſwell for that the people of <hi>Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ugall</hi>
vppon thunderſtanding of <hi>Don Anthonios</hi> treatye aboute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with his maieſtye woulde bee quickelye mooued to
electe the Duke of <hi>Bargantia</hi> for their Kinge, as alſo for that
the ſayde Agente coulde doe nothing therein without expreſſe
commiſſion from <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> whome the matter concerned,
ſaying hee woulde with ſpeede repayre vnto him aboute the
ſame cauſe, and in the meane tyme the ſayde gentleman might
make his retourne to the King of <hi>Caſtile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heereuppon this Gentlemanne retourned to the Kinge
of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and the Agente in greate daunger came ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretlye
to <hi>Lisbone</hi> where hee founde <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> in the
Prieſtes howſe. And hauing ſignified vnto him, what
hadde paſſed beetweene him and the Gentlemanne afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:296:13"/>
               <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> aunſwered hee was verye glad his Agent
had thus eſcaped the kinge of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> handes. And as touching
the making of anye accorde with the ſame Kinge, it was farre
from his meaning, but his determination was rather to expecte
what ſhoulde bee reſolued and determined by the Iudges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ordeyned. Within a little while after <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſed,
howe Kinge <hi>Henry</hi> was informed of his ſecrete beeing
in <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and had already ſerched many howſes for him. Vppon
thunderſtanding whereof, hee repayred ſecretlie with his Agent,
<hi>Didaco de Carcamo, Anthony de Soſa,</hi> and <hi>Anthony S<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2+ letters">

                  </gap>res,</hi> into a
Barque whiche his ſayde Agent kepte alwaies readye for a neede
in the hauen of <hi>Lisbone.</hi> Wherein after hee had beene by the ſpace
of a fewe dayes conueyed agayne vp and downe the riuer, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued
newes that Kinge <hi>Henry</hi> was dead, Whiche happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the beginning of Februarie 1580.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was more certainelye aduertiſed of theſe
newes, he came forthwith to <hi>Lisbone,</hi> giuing notyce of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the gouernours and Captayne generall of the ſame Cytie,
who reſorted preſently to him to congratulate his comming, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to make him king. Whereunto he anſwered very diſcreetely
that king <hi>Henry</hi> was but newly deceaſed and howe theſtates, and
gouernours of the kingdome were aſſembled to diſpoſe of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the ſame, and that there were alſo other princes and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
pretending to haue right and action thereto, and therfore
hee determined to expecte what ſhoulde bee Iudged therein by
waye of Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>The next day <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> withdrew himſelfe into a monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
neere the Citie of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> called <hi>Belen</hi> of thorder of S. Ierome,
halfe a mile from the ſame cytie, where his grandfather king <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuell</hi>
and thother two kinges deſcending of him were buried. And
hauing there accompliſhed his deuotions, he repaired to <hi>Santaren</hi>
a myle from <hi>Almerine</hi> where the ſayde Gouernoures of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
were then aſſembled: who being ſuborned by the King
of Caſtiles ambaſſadors and very deſirous to deliuer the kingdom
into his hands, tooke it in very euill part that <hi>Don Anthonyo</hi> came
thither, ſith by king <hi>Henries</hi> commandement he was vpon pain of

he ſuppoſed the rancour and hatred of King <hi>Henry</hi> againſt
him, had not taken ſo deepe roote, as that he did perſeuere there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to the ende, but rather before his death had ſhewed ſome toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of repentance thereof. And therefore very inſtantly prayed them
to open the ſayd teſtament without further delay, that it might be
manifeſt what king <hi>Henry</hi> had ordeined, touching the ſucceſſion
of the kingdom: inſomuch that the gouernours moued therewith,
commanded the kings laſt will and teſtament to be opened, in the
preſence of thambaſſadors of the king of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> the dukes of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy,</hi>
and <hi>Bargantia,</hi> and of the Prince of <hi>Parma:</hi> whereby it was
found, how King <hi>Henry</hi> had ordeined, that the Iudges appointed
to determine the matter, touching the ſucceſſion of the kingdom,
ſhould proceede no further nor decree any thing therein, vntil the
cauſe concerning <hi>Don Anthonyes</hi> legittimation were decided by
the Iudges therfore authoriſed by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
proueth all the rigorous dealing of king <hi>Henry</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>Don Anthonie,</hi> to haue proceeded rather through diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or for feare of the king of <hi>Castile,</hi> then otherwiſe of any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
grounded vpon right and iuſtice. Vpon the ſight of this teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the gouernours declared to thambaſſadours, of thother
pretenders, howe they could not nowe determine any thing tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the ſucceſſion of the kingdome, except the cauſe of <hi>Don
Anthonies</hi> legittimation were firſt decided. Wherefore they ſent
worde to <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> to proſecute the cauſe touching his legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
before the Iudges thereunto authoriſed, namely the <hi>Popes</hi>
nuncye then being in <hi>Portugall</hi> and tharchbiſhop of <hi>Lisbone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the meane ſpace, the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> (hauing ſince the death
of king <hi>Sebaſtian,</hi> by little and litle gathered a mightie armie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
vnder pretence of attempting ſome enterpriſe againſt <hi>Aphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,)</hi>
not minding to ſtay for iudgement in the matter of <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonies</hi>
legitimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor in the cauſe of the ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the crowne,
commaunded all his men to ioyne together vnder the Duke of
<hi>Alua</hi> captaine generall ouer the ſame armie, about the towne of
<hi>Badaioz</hi> in the kingdome of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> bordering vpon the limittes
of <hi>Portugall.</hi> Vpon notice whereof, the gouernours and Iudges
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:296:14"/>
authoriſed to decyde the cauſe of the ſucceſſion of the kingdome,
ſent certaine deputyes to the Kinge of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> praying him to
voutchſafe to leaue the waye of armes and take the courſe of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
ſith there were Iudges ordeyned to heare and examine the
cauſe and to Iudge &amp; determine the ſame according to right and
equity. To whoſe Iudgement thother pretenders were readye
to ſtande: Informinge hym withall that by proceedinge to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
the kingdome by force of Armes hee ſtoode in daunger to
looſe all his righte and tytle thereto by meanes of a decree made
for that cauſe by Kinge <hi>Henry,</hi> whereby it was ordeyned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided,
that euerye of the pretenders goeing aboute by force
of Armes to gette the kingdome and refuſinge to ſtande to the
iudgement of the Iudges aucthoriſed to decide the cauſe, ſhould
thereby loſe and forfaite all his righte and tytle which hee had or
might pretend to the kingdome.</p>
            <p>Howbeit the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> (who as is afore mencioned) had
long before hand declared, how hee woulde not ſubmitte his right
to anye mannes iudgement,) truſting vppon his owne power, and
thendeuour of the ſayde gouernours and other noble men whom
hee had wonne to his ſide by giftes and fayre promiſes, without
anye regarde of that information, commaunded the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi>
with his army (which hee had in a readineſſe) to proceede and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade
the kingdome of <hi>Portugall</hi> by force. Vppon notice whereof,
the gouernors foorthwith departed from <hi>Almerin</hi> to <hi>Setuball</hi> fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene
myles from <hi>Santaren</hi> fearinge leaſte the people of <hi>Portugall</hi>
vppon knowledge of the Duke of <hi>Aluaes</hi> comming to inuade the
realme, woulde firſt fall vppon them and then proclaime <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio</hi>
King. Within a ſhort ſpace after the departure of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors
from <hi>Almerin,</hi> newes came to <hi>Santaren</hi> howe the Duke of
<hi>Alua</hi> had taken two townes in <hi>Portugall</hi> bordering vppon Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,
to wit <hi>Eluas</hi> and <hi>campo maior.</hi> Whereat the Citizens of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taren</hi>
being greatly mooued firſt toke counſell together for the for<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tifying
of their towne againſt the violence of thennimy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
went in all ſolemnity with the clergy and nobillity to ſuruey
and vewe the walles, &amp; giue order for the beginning of the worke.
After that they reſorted all together in great multitude to <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonyo</hi>
then remayning in a monaſtery not far from thence, where
ill with one voice ſalute &amp; call him king leading him from thence
to the principall church, and then to the townhowſe, inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiring
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:296:14"/>
him to accept the royall name and dignitie and to bind
them to him by oath. Howbeit <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> contrariwiſe aleged
vnto them how the cauſe touching the ſucceſſion of the Crowne
was in controuerſie betweene him and other Princes pretending
tytle thereto, wherefore he would not accept the royall name, but
rather expect the determination of the Iudges therfore authoriſed.
But if they would vſe him as their defender he was ready to ſpend
his life and goodes for them and the common liberty of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
Whereunto the Citizens of <hi>Santaren</hi> aunſwered againe howe
their reſolution was to make him King, ſith the people of <hi>Portugall</hi>
(as is before expreſſed) might lawfully doe it for defaulte of heyres
maſles in the right line. Which they were the more deſirous to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh,
for that the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> in contempt of all other Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
would be his own iudge &amp; went about to poſſeſſe the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
by violence &amp; force of armes. Therupon whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> could
no longer reſiſt, he was ſworne, King, by the three members of the
ſame place, namely, the Clergie, the nobillitie, and the common
people, with erection of the Kinges ſtandarde and all other ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
according to the auncient cuſtome of the countrey, beinge
conducted from thence with the ſaide ſtandarde to a Chappell of
great deuotion, called <hi>Sancto Milagre</hi> and other accuſtomed pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and laſt of al to the royal Pallace. Of all which things publique
acts were made &amp; ſubſcribed by the ſaid three members, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
regiſtred in the townhowſe of the ſame city. Vpon thaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
wherof <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> proteſted openly in the preſence
of the ſame three members and many others that he accepted the
royal name more by force, then of his owne accorde, and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he determined to lay downe the ſame, and expect the Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Iudges, in caſe the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> would call backe his
army which he had alredy ſent into <hi>Portugal,</hi> &amp; ſubmit his cauſe to
the iudgment of the iudges authoriſed as aforeſaide, of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
hee cauſed a publique act to bee made and enrolled the
ſame amongeſt the recordes of <hi>Santaren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Within three daies after, Don <hi>Anthonio</hi> went to <hi>Lisbone</hi> where
within a mile from the city, he was mette by the ordinary gariſons
of the realme with their Captaines, and many of the cheefe of the
nobilitie, amongſt whom were Peter Dor a French gentleman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
for the moſt excellent Princeſſe the french queenemother &amp;
M. <hi>Edward Perin</hi> eche of them with a goodly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of ſtrangers.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:296:15"/>
When he came to the gate of the citie, there ſtayed for him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
men of the three orders of the Fryers minors, who receiued
his maieſtie with great deuotion and reuerence, and in forme of
proceſſion marched before him ſinging <hi>Te Deum laudamus. &amp;c.</hi>
In this ſort the king was firſt brought to the Cathedrall Church,
and in all places where he paſſed, the people ſhewed themſelues
ſo ioyfull, as the like thereof was neuer ſeene before at thelection
or receiuing of any of the ſaide former Kings. When he came to
the Cathedrall Church, he was there receiued with great honour
and reuerence by all the Cleargie, with the celebration of all cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
thereunto by cuſtome appertaining, and from thence was
conduced to the Regall Pallace. The next day, the gouernours &amp;
magiſtrates with the moſt noble and principal men of the citie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the three eſtats of the realme, cauſed the royall ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
to be caried before them, through all the principall ſtreets of
the citie, crying aloud, <hi>God ſaue king Anthonie, &amp; grant him long life.</hi>
In thend they came all to the ſaid Pallace, where they ſwore him
for King, binding themſelues to him by othe<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>: whereof likewiſe

thereupon in the like ſort that he had made at <hi>Santaren,</hi> when hee
was there choſen and ſworne for king: whereof alſo a publique
act was made and enrolled as aboueſaid.</p>
            <p>Now when it came to the knowledge of the gouernours of the
Realme then remaining at <hi>Setuball,</hi> that <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
King, the greater part of them withdrew themſelues into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile,</hi>
to wit, <hi>Iohn Maſquerennas, Frauncis de Sa,</hi> and <hi>Diego Lopez
de Soſa,</hi> thother two, namely tharchbiſhop of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and <hi>John
Tello de Meneſes</hi> came within three myles of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> and ſent
to King <hi>Anthonie,</hi> beſeeching him to voutchſafe to receaue them
into his fauour: which they eaſely obtained at his hands, ſith the
one of them namely <hi>John Tello de Meneſes</hi> had alwayes ſhewed
himſelfe to beare a good affection to the common wealth, and
tharchbiſhop had alwayes ſhewed himſelfe a neutre, where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe
thother three which were fled into <hi>Caſtile,</hi> being wonne
and corrupted by the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> with giftes and promiſes, had
alwayes openly mainteined his quarrell: and yet in thende did
pennance for their horrible treaſon. For ſhortly after they dyed al
for very griefe and melancholy that they had ſold their countrey,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:296:15"/>
and could obtaine little or nothing of all that had bene promiſed
vnto them on the behalfe of the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> by his ambaſſadors.</p>
            <p>Within certaine dayes after, king <hi>Anthonie</hi> departed from the
citie of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to <hi>Setuball,</hi> where ſtill remained the deputies of
the townes, with the high Chauncelour, the principall Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
of the realme, and many of the nobilitie: By whome he was
likewiſe created and ſworne King with all ſolemnities thereunto
conuenient. Where the third time he made the like proteſtation
that he had made afore in <hi>Santaren,</hi> ſending two of the ſaid depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
from thence to the king of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> with commiſſion to declare
vnto him, that if he would deſiſt from force of armes, and ſubmit
his cauſe to the determination of the Iudges thereunto authoriſed,
that then he would doe the like, and lay downe the name and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
of king. And hauing firſt giuen order for the defence of a
towne called <hi>Monte Maior</hi> (which was in daunger to be beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the duke of <hi>Alua)</hi> he returned from thence to the citie of
<hi>Lisbon.</hi> In the meane while the king of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> howe much the
more he was moued by <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> and others to commit his
cauſe to be determined by way of iuſtice, ſo much the more he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured
to get the kingdome by force, making great offers not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
to <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> in conſideration that he ſhoulde
yeeld vp the royal name, and renounce his action to the kingdom.
But neuertheleſſe <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> ſeeking the libertie of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
more then his owne benefit, would neuer yeelde to accept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

            <p>Now when <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was come backe to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> hee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched

and to the townes and caſtles of <hi>Aphrica,</hi> and thylandes and
firme lande, ſubiect to the crowne of <hi>Portugall,</hi> certifying them
how he was choſen and ſworne king, and therefore required them
all from thenceforward, to take &amp; knowledge him for their king,
the like alſo was written to all the ſaid townes, Caſtles, Iſlandes
and firme land, by the ſaid gouernours and magiſtrates of the citie
of <hi>Lisbon.</hi> Immediatly vpon the deliuerie of theſe letters, <hi>Don
Anthonio</hi> was in all places acknowledged and proclaimed king
in all ſolemnitie, and that ſo greatly to the ioy and contentation of
all thinhabitantes as is ſcant poſſible to bee beleeued. In the

laye in his power, for the defence of the ſaide Citye of <hi>Lisbone,</hi>
(which is the chiefe Citye of the realme,) for that the Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua</hi>
approched from daye to daye with a greate armye whiche hee
brought by land &amp; ſea, amounting to about ſixe and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

and well appointed, the moſt parte of them comming by lande &amp;
the reſt by ſea in fiftye gallyes and about as manye great ſhippes.
At laſte theſe two armies comming by lande and ſea, mette and
ioyned together at the towne of <hi>Setuball</hi> whiche was quickelye
brought vnder the power of thennimie by reaſon it was neyther
anye ſtrong towne, nor prouided of gunpowder, whiche in greate

had bene before that conueyed into <hi>Caſtile</hi> by the ſayde gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
vnder coloure of thexpedition whiche was pretended into
<hi>Aphrica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> hauing thus taken this towne of <hi>Setuball,</hi>
cauſed the moſte parte of the footemen to be imbarqued in the

Duke. Through this mans labour and induſtrie, the Duke in fewe
daies eaſilye got this towne into his handes, where <hi>Diego de me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neces</hi>
a gentleman of a noble houſe was gouernour, who after the
yielding vp of the towne was beheaded by the Duke of <hi>Aluaes</hi>

hanged vppon a gibette notwithſtanding that eache of them had

            <p>After the taking of this towne of <hi>Caſcais</hi> the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued

Duke by the ſpace of one daye had beaten the Caſtle with great
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:296:16"/>
ordinaunce, withoute doing it anye harme, the nexte daye the
ſayde gouernour thoughe hee wanted neyther munition nor anye
other neceſſaries, yet after parle with the Duke of <hi>Alua,</hi> yeilded
the Caſtle into his handes vppon the Dukes promiſe that the
King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> ſhould yeilde vnto him a greate pencion yeerelye
during his lyfe, but euen as traitors by gods iuſte iudgemente are
commonly payde according to their deſert, ſo this man was ſo
farre from hauing promiſe kept with him, as that contrariwiſe
hee was preſentlye by the King of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> commaundement ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed

a whole daye and yeilded not the Caſtle at the firſte ſomonce
but after by compoſition, whereas hee had beefore promiſed and
written, that immediatelye vpon the Dukes comming he would
yeilde vp the Caſtle. Wherefore hee purchaſed the name of a
Traytor without reaping anye commoditye thereby as it often
happeneth to traytors.</p>
            <p>When this Caſtle was thus yeilded (whereby the free paſſage

of <hi>Lisbon</hi> where King <hi>Anthony</hi> then remayned in the ſubburbes
called <hi>Alcantara,</hi> with his Armye conſiſting of aboute ſixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande
footemen, and eyghte hundered horſemen of his owne
kingdome, the greateſt parte thereof beeing ſmallye experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in feates of armes. Wherefore althoughe it ſeemed not
ſufficiente to reſiſte ſo puiſſaunte an armye as the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi>
brought, yet King <hi>Anthonie</hi> more regarding the common
wealth and lybertye of his Countrey, then the ſafetie and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation
of his owne perſon, determined to hazarde the battayle
rather then lightlye and ignominiouſlye to yielde himſelfe and his
people into thandes of the Tyrants, hoping for the lyke good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
that in tyme paſte Kinge <hi>Iohn</hi> the firſt, of that name had who
with ſixe thouſande <hi>Portugalles</hi> in a verye lyke quarrell ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>Iohn</hi> Kinge of <hi>Caſtile</hi> the firſte alſo of that name, with
his Armye of thirtie and two thouſande men, in a battayle
foughte beetweene them neere the village of <hi>Algiba Rotta</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:296:17"/>
But after certaine ſkirmiſhes, wherein two-thouſand Caſtillians
were ſlaine, it fortuned the ſame day that the ſaid king <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio</hi>
thought to haue ioyned battell with the king of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
(which was the xxiiii. day of Auguſt) earely in the morning,
many of them that were with him, ſeeing thenemie approch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to flye: whereof certaine went to thenemies, ſpecially the
horſemen, a great part whereof (as afterwardes manifeſtly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared)
were corrupted by the king of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> beſides there was
great want of gunpowder in King <hi>Anthonies</hi> campe: for at that
time by the default and treaſon of the ſaid gouernours (who as is
afore declared) had conueied a great quantitie of gunpowder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Caſtile,</hi> there could not be found aboue two thouſande pound
weight of the ſaide powder in all the citie of <hi>Lisbon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon conſideration of all theſe thinges, King <hi>Anthonies</hi> moſt
principall &amp; faithfull ſeruants counſelled him to prouide in time
for the ſafetie of his perſon, for as long as it was ſafe, there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ſome hope of the recouerie of the libertie of the countrey,
which in caſe he were loſt, was vtterly vnrecouerable for euer.
Which aduiſe by his maieſtie well weighed and conſidered, hee
determined with many of his noble men and others that were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
faithfull vnto him, to breake thorow a ſquadron of horſemen,
whereby thenemie ſuppoſed to haue cut away from him all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
to eſcape away. And thereupon without delay cauſing the
Kings royall ſtandard to march before him, they all ſet ſpurres to
their horſes, and ſo furiouſly aſſayle thenemies, that ſtraitghtwaies
they droue them from their place, and ſo with their weapons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
their paſſage. Wherein King <hi>Anthonie</hi> himſelfe receiued
two great woundes in his head by ſtaying (and that not without
effect) to helpe <hi>Ferdinando Valeroſo</hi> out of the handes of thene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
And although the King was greatly troubled and weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by meanes of thoſe woundes whereout the bloud ranne in
great abundance downe his eyes and face: yet more by Gods
prouidence then by mans ſtrength or induſtrie he eſcaped from
the ennimies, and yet not once but diuers times was driuen to
breake thorowe the middeſt of them with foure or fiue horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that continually followed him (of the which number was
Fraunces of <hi>Portugall</hi> Erle of <hi>Vimioſo)</hi> the reſidue of thoſe that
holpe to make the ſaide paſſage being turned another waye
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:296:17"/>
carrying the Kings ſtandarde before them. Nowe when the kinge
had paſſed through all the Cyty, of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> meeting his enemies in
diuers places, at laſt he came to the ſhoreſide of the riuer of <hi>Tagus</hi>
which runneth by theſt end of the Cyty where he found <hi>Emanuell</hi>
of <hi>Portugall</hi> Vncle to the ſaide Erle of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>imioſo,</hi> already imbarqued
to fly to the City of <hi>Santaren.</hi> Who aſſoone as he knew the King,
cauſed the Barque to be brought to the ſhore, that his Maieſtye
might bee receaued thereinto and ſo paſſe awaye with the ſayde
Erle and others amongſt whome was <hi>Simon Maſquerennas</hi> deane
of <hi>Ebora</hi> who came to the king at that very inſtante when he was
ready to enter the Barque.</p>
            <p>Nowe as the king was ſayling vp the riuer in the ſaide barque
towarde <hi>Santaren,</hi> his Agent (hauing followed the ſtandard) came
preſently by great chaunce to the ſame place where the king was
taken into the barque, and vnderſtanding his Maieſtie to be therin
ſeeing the ſame a farre off, and perceauing how certen of the king
of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> galleys purſued the ſame verye neere diſcharging ſtore
of harquebuſh ſhot thereat, he galloped after by the riuer ſide in
all poſſible haſte to ouertake the barque and beeing come righte
againſt the ſame, ceaſed not to make ſignes from the ſhore ſide
that it ſhoulde come to lande in the place where he was, and as it
was comming towarde him, hee cauſed two of them that were in
his companye to alight their horſes namely <hi>Anthonie de Soſa,</hi> and
<hi>Jerom de Sylua,</hi> appointing the beſt horſe to the Kinge, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to therle of <hi>Vimioſo</hi> and <hi>Emanuell</hi> of <hi>Portugall</hi> his vncle, and
taking <hi>Simon Maſquerennas</hi> behind him vppon his owne horſe.
In this maner they galloped away all as faſt as they could through
Oliue trees and other vnfrequented places, till they were in ſome
better ſafetie. But ſcarſely was the King with thother three lords
aforenamed landed, when the barque was preſently aſſayled and
taken by one of the Gallyes ſo as the reſte that remained behind
coulde not come to ſhoare, the greateſt parte of thennimies lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
into the water where it was ſhallowe for the eaſier taking of
the ſaide barque, where they tooke many priſoners, amongeſt
whome the chiefeſt were <hi>Emmanuell de Castro</hi> and <hi>Anthonie Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tado</hi>
and other the Kings ſeruants.</p>
            <p>When the duke of <hi>Alua</hi> was entred into <hi>Lisbon,</hi> ſuppoſing <hi>Don
Anthonio</hi> had hid himſelfe there, he made no great ſearch after
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:296:18"/>
him in the fieldes. In ſo much that while the ſouldiors were buſie
in ſpoyling the ſubburbes, and ſearch was made in the towne for
him, the King with them of his companye came firſte to a Village
three miles from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where after he had ſtayed a little to dreſſe
his wounds he paſſed further from thence by vnfrequented waies,
and came that night to a houſe of pleaſure a myle from <hi>Santaren,</hi>
belonging to <hi>Peter de Menezes</hi> one of his treaſourers who ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke
his maieſty in the waye, flying alſo from thennemye in the
company of the Biſhop of <hi>Guardia.</hi> The next day after his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
comming to this place, he ſent his <hi>Agent</hi> to <hi>Santaren</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
to the gouernour and Magiſtrates of the Towne, how he was
determined to come thither, praying them to receaue and defend
him in caſe thennemy purſued him thither. Wherevpon the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour
and Magiſtrates, vppon notice of the Kinges comming,
went with a great companye of the Citizens to meet him halfe a
myle without the Towne, and there very humblye receaued him
not without great lamentation for that which had happened at
<hi>Lisbon</hi> the day before: and ſo conducted him to the royall palace
of the City, offering all with one accorde to ſpende their liues and
gooddes in his defence if he woulde ſtaye there. Bur for that the
Towne was not verye ſtrong nor conuenientlye furniſhed, with a
garriſon, munitions of warre and other neceſſaryes, to abyde a
ſiege, he ſtayed there onely twoo dayes to heale his woundes, and
then tooke his iourney towarde <hi>Porto</hi> of <hi>Portugall</hi> a ſea towne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
ſtrong, about fifty myles from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> (whither the Duke
of <hi>Aluaes</hi> armye eaſely coulde not paſſe) where the Kinge might
haue conuenient place and oportunitie to repayre his armie and
ſtay for ayde, which he hoped for out of Fraunce or England. In
this iourney the king <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was accompanyed, by the
Byſhop of <hi>Guardia,</hi> the Erle of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>imioſo, Emanuell de Sylua</hi> then
gouernour of the ſayde Citie of <hi>Santaren, Peter de Meneſes,</hi> and
his maieſties Agent, beeing all of his priuie counſell, with manye
other Lordes, Gentlemen, and other perſons of great worſhippe
and calling to the number of about twoo hundred horſemen and
a thouſande footemen. And in the ſame by reaſon of his woundes
became ſo weake and feeble, that he coulde not abyde to ſit his
horſe nor be carryed in his Litter, but was dryuen to be borne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
mens ſhoulders. Then comming to the Towne of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temaior</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:296:18"/>
not farre from <hi>Col<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

to refreſh himſelfe and cure his woundes, gathering men togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the meane ſpace, to aboute the number of eyghte thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande
wherewith he martched to the Citye of <hi>Auero</hi> and was in

as Kinge, notwithſtanding that the Kinge of <hi>Caſtile</hi>
had alreadye ſubdued <hi>Lisbon</hi> the chiefe Cytye of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
When the ſayde Kinge <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> drewe neere
to this Cytye of <hi>Auero</hi> hee ſommoned thinhabitantes to take
his parte and topen the gates of their Cytie vnto him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>imioſo</hi> (whome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that hee made Counſtable of <hi>Portugall)</hi> to doe his ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to take it by force, giuing alſo the ſpoyle of the Cytye
to the ſouldiours. And thoughe it were well furniſhed with
munitions of warre and other neceſſaries, yet the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
parte of the Citizens refufed to make reſiſtaunce againſte
Kynge <hi>Anthonies</hi> men, inſomuche that the Towne was taken
eaſily by ſcaling the walles and otherwiſe, and ſo brought vnder
his obedience and ſacked. But yet vppon the taking of the
ſame, his maieſtie gaue ſuche order that the ſoldiours excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not in their inſolencie, ſo that all thinges were ſoone in
quietneſſe, his maieſtie lodging there firſt in the monaſterye of
rhe dominican freres by the ſpace of three dayes, wente from-thence
to a verye fayre large houſe pleaſauntlye ſcituated vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
the riuer and beelonging to <hi>Franciſco de Tauares</hi> a gentleman
who a little before was gone to the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> to ſue for pardon
bycauſe he had ſaluted and acknowledged king <hi>Anthonie</hi> for king.
When Kinge <hi>Anthony</hi> had cauſed certaine traytours in this Cyty to
be executed by order of law, he continued his iourney towarde the
ſaid towne of <hi>porto</hi> of <hi>Portugall,</hi> lykewiſe ſommoning the citizens
of the ſame to acknowledge him for their king, and to open the
gates of their cyty vnto him. In this towne was then gouernor <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taleon
de Sà</hi> brother of <hi>Frauncis de Sà</hi> one of the three gouernours,
which preſentlye after <hi>Don Anthonie</hi> was choſen King, fled to the
king of <hi>Castile.</hi> This gouernour being likewiſe wonne to the
King of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> ſide, was a meane with other of his complices
that entrance into this towne was denyed to King <hi>Anthony,</hi> his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:296:19"/>
maieſtie conceauing greate diſpleaſure thereat aſſembled men
from all partes thereaboutes to encreaſe his armie &amp; made al poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
preparation to paſſe ouer the Ryuer and take the towne by
force. When all thinges neceſſary for the ſiege were in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
as the king was marching with all his hoſte againſt the town
hauing in his campe about twelue thouſand men, and yet the moſt
of them vnarmed, the Citizens began preſentlye to ryſe in ſuch a
mutinie againſt Pantaleon the gouernour and his complyces who
pretended to reſiſt <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> and his men, that the ſayde go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouernor
and his pertakers had much a doe to ſaue themſelues by
flight from the furye of the people, whereby it came to paſſe that al
the religious and clergy men of the towne camme foorth to meete
the King, beſeeching his maieſtie to pardon the Cytizens in that
they had not yeilded the towne into his hands vpon the firſt ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monce
according to their alleagence and the dutye of their oath.
Whereupon the King in thend, was content of his naturall cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to pardon their offence vpon condition they ſhould compound
with the ſouldiours to whome he had graunted the ſacking of the
towne. By reaſon whereof the Citizens promiſed for the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
of the ſame from ſacking, to giue the ſouldioures a hundred
thouſande Duckets. And ſo the Kinge at his entraunce into the
towne was honorablye receaued by the Citizens, whereupon his
maieſtie preſently ſent the Biſhop of <hi>Guardia</hi> from thence with al
ſpeede to the next prouince called <hi>Entre dueroe Minho</hi> to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
thinhabitans and gather men &amp; victuals for thaugmenting
and prouiſion of his campe, and ſo ſtayed certaine daies in the
ſame towne expecting aide and gunpowder from Fraunce.</p>
            <p>Nowe the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> (vnderſtanding howe Kinge <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
was come to Porto and there encreſed his army) feared leaſt
his Maieſty ſhould receaue aide from Fraunce, and therefore in all
haſt ſente <hi>Sancho de Auila</hi> (ſometime gouernour of the Caſtle of
<hi>Antwerp)</hi> with two thouſand horſemen and eyght thouſand foote
men, Artillerie and all other munitions and neceſſarye prouiſion
of warre to beſiege the ſaide towne of Porto, who ariued there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
thirtie daies after King <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> came thither. Nowe
when the ſaid King <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was informed of thenimies com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ming
he gaue order to all townes where they ſhould paſſe, to giue
them free paſſage without reſiſtaunce for that his maieſtie coulde
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:296:19"/>
not defende them by reaſon he wanted horſemen and gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and that the greateſt part of his ſouldiors which ſerued him in
the getting of <hi>Porto,</hi> were retyred hoame to their owne houſes.
When <hi>Sancho Dauila</hi> was come before the Towne of <hi>Porto,</hi> hee
ſtayed with his armie and planted his artillery vppon the farther
ſide of the riuer of <hi>Dureto</hi> ouer againſt <hi>Porto,</hi> from whence he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to batter the walles of the towne with his artillery, but foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as he got little this way by reaſon of the great ſpace which
was betweene him and the towne, he determined to paſſe ouer
the riuer to that ſide, which lyeth next <hi>Porto.</hi> And in the ende ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
his determination with certaine barques and boates,
which for the ſame purpoſe he had procured from all partes. For
King <hi>Don Anthonies</hi> men were not able to hinder the ſaid paſſage,
by reaſon they were for the moſte part vnarmed and vnexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Anthonie</hi> ſeeing his affaires in theſe hard termes determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to make his retrayte to the towne of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iane,</hi> a port alſo of the
ſea, intending there to embarque himſelfe for Fraunce, with many
noble men and others following him, to about the number of fiue
hundred, with whom he came to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iane</hi> verye late in the night,
weary and euill at eaſe, &amp; not yet throughly healed of his wounds.
In this place, he prepared fiue ſhips the next daye, and furniſhed
them with victualles and all other neceſſaries for the ſayde em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barquement.
Now when all thinges were ready therevnto, and
the king and his companye almoſt all embarqued, there chaunced
a great tempeſt with a contrary winde out of the ſea, whereby the
ſhips were all ſtayed and could not depart out of the hauen. In the
meane ſpace <hi>Sancho Dauila</hi> ſending his horſemen before, came
after himſelfe with the reſte of his armye to beſiege the towne.
Wherefore King <hi>Anthonie</hi> fearing leaſt the ſhips would from the
the land at laſt be vexed and ſuncke with the artillery of the enue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
and ſeeing he coulde not ſayle out of the hauen by reaſon of
contrary wind, determined (while he had time) to ſaue him ſelfe
from ſo apparant a daunger, before thennemie had hemmed him
in on all ſides. And therefore in all haſt forſaking the ſhippes, with
great griefe, he tooke his leaue of the principall noble men, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that were about him, exhorting them, euery man to prouide
for their ſafety by the beſt meanes they could: amongſt whom the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:296:20"/>
chiefe were, the ſayde Erle of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>imioſo,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Guardia, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuell
de Sylua, Peter Fernando,</hi> and <hi>Diego de Meneſes,</hi> with
manye other of the auncient nobilitie, prayinge them to bee
all of good courage, hopinge at laſte fortune woulde ſo
chaunge that hee mighte gyue them honourable recompence
for their good ſeruices doone vnto him and which he hoped to
receaue at their handes in time to come.</p>
            <p>Thus King <hi>Anthonie</hi> with all poſſible ſpeede paſſed awaye on
foot vp the riuer ſide, hauing in his companye onelye his ſayde
Agent, and one of his ſeruauntes called <hi>Thomas Cachero,</hi>
with twoo honeſte Burgheſſes of the ſayde towne of <hi>Viane</hi>
who knewe the coaſtes of the countreye, ſending his treaſurer
before him with aboute fourtie men attending the ſame. But
hauinge in this maner paſſed but a little waye, they ſpied vppon
an hill not farre off, a troupe of the ennemies horſemen bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fiftie in number or aboue, who ſeemed to come downe
into the plaine fielde, and directlye to take their courſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the king.</p>
            <p>Wherefore for the auoyding of ſo preſent a daunger, by his
Agentes counſell, hee cauſed the company attending his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoure
to depart from him and to martche and paſſe with the
ſame ouer the playne fielde, whileſt him ſelfe with his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
<hi>Thomas Cachero</hi> and the ſayde twoo Burgheſſes of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane</hi>
helde on their waye by the riuer ſide. This deuiſe tooke
good ſucceſſe, for the ennemy directed his courſe ſtraight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
the greater companye, making none accoumpt of the
ſmaller number which paſſed by the riuer ſide. Inſomuch
that while the ennemye ſpente his time to purſue and take
the treaſure (amounting to little leſſe then a million of golde) The
king founde meane (when he was got a good waye of) to ſaue
him ſelfe (with thoſe foure that were in his companye) by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ouer the ſayde riuer where it was ſhallow, but yet the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
came vp to their breſtes as they paſſed thorough.</p>
            <p>When they were thus come to the other ſide of the riuer bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that ſide where the towne of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iane</hi> is ſcituate, they ſpied a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:296:20"/>
farre off, other troupes of horſemen and foote men who (by all
likelyhood) ſought alſo for the King, for which cauſe his maieſtye
and his companye thought good to goe ouer the riuer agayne to
the ſame ſide from whence he came. Vpon the accompliſhment
whereof they hidde them ſelues amongeſt buſhes and young trees
by the water ſide, where they aboade all the ſame daye
which was the twelfth of October faſtinge and wette, for
it ſcant ceaſed from rayning all that daye. At night they
went a foote from thence by pathes and otherwyſe as they
coulde, to a Village about two myles from <hi>Viane,</hi> beeing
there receaued into a poore wydowes houſe where hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
all the ſame nighte and the daye followinge. The
nexte night hee departed from thence to other places tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
vnfrequented wayes and deſartes, taking with him
to the companye hee had before, a fift man whoſe name
was <hi>Iaſper de Gran,</hi> whome hee founde vppon the ſhore
at his firſte paſſage ouer the riuer. This <hi>Jaſper</hi> was one
of his olde and moſte faythfull ſeruauntes, who was the
greateſt meane that the Kinge had, ſo happely eſcaped out of
the <hi>Moores</hi> handes when hee was captiue in <hi>Aphrica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for that <hi>Sancho Dauila</hi> coulde not finde the Kinge
in the ſhippes, neither in the Towne of <hi>Viane</hi> nor elſewhere
there aboutes, hee gaue order to all his horſe men and
foote men to diſperſe them ſelues in diuerſe troupes, and to
paſſe into all places and Villages of the prouince adioyning,
called in the <hi>Portugall</hi> tongue, <hi>Entre Dueroe Minho,</hi> to ſeeke
for King <hi>Anthonie,</hi> promiſing great and ample rewarde to

Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> remayning ſtill at <hi>Lisbone</hi> to appoynt ſufficient
watch and warde in euery of the ſea portes to watch diligently
that King <hi>Anthonie</hi> embarqued not him ſelfe to depart out of the
kingdome.</p>
            <p>Alſo the Duke of <hi>Alua</hi> him ſelfe and <hi>Sancho Dauila</hi>
withall, wrote to the like effect, to all townes and places of

the Kingdome of <hi>Caſtile</hi> bordering vpon <hi>Portugall.</hi> In ſomuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that great and curious ſearch was made in euerye place for Kinge

            <p>But if all perils and diſcommodities whiche King <hi>Anthony</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
while hee thus wandered in deſartes and ſolitarye places to
eſcape thandes of his enimie, ſhould here bee expreſſed and ſette
downe, ſcarſe woulde a large volume ſuffice thereunto. Yet this
is to be noted, how all this happened to his maieſtie when he was
aboue thage of fortye yeres, and not in perfite health, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of winter, and coldeſt countrey of all <hi>Portugall,</hi> where hee
was conſtrayned to ſpende many nightes in the playne fieldes and
that very often in ſnowe and rayne all the night long, without ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fire or other remedy againſt the colde, being for the moſt part
all the whole daye without meate or drinke, for his foode (ſuch
as it was) for the moſt part was brought vnto him in the nighte by
the ſayde countriman <hi>Ferdinando Martines.</hi> (Yea his maieſtye
thoughte himſelfe happye when hee coulde put his heade vnder

kinde of lodging the countreymen vſe in thoſe partes of <hi>Portugall</hi>
without eyther beddes or ſheetes (ſpecially where there bee no

in his apparell wrapped onelye in a couerlet whiche the ſayd <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mas Cachero</hi> alwaies carried with him for that purpoſe. Manye
tymes alſo his maieſtie was almoſte apprehended by his enimies
who lefte no place vnſifted for him, inſomuche that the ſpaniardes
often came to the verye ſame place where the King had beene,
within an howre or thereabouts after his maieſties departure
from the ſame, where they miſerably afflicted the poore husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that had harbored his highnes, executing ſome by the corde,
and burning their houſes. But yet for all that, other husbande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
refuſed not to harbour his maieſtie in their houſes when oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
required, notwithſtanding they knew his perſon very well,
for they were ſo well affectioned toward him, that none of them
euer bewrayed him to the Caſtilians, and yet were they not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt
of the great quantitie of money which the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> by
open proclamations had promiſed to whoſoeuer coulde deliuer
him dead or aliue. In all theſe ſo great and incomparable daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:296:22"/>
the ſayde king <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> hath alwayes ſhewed ſo chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and conſtante a mynde as though no misfortune at all had
chaunced vnto him, alwaies encouraging and comforting thoſe
that were in his company, ſetting alwaies before his owne eyes a
ſtedfaſt hope not onely to paſſe and ouercome all theſe dangers &amp;
toyles but alſo in thend t'attaine to the recouery of his kingdome.</p>
            <p>Heere alſo is to bee noted, that whileſt Kinge <hi>Anthonie</hi> was
toſſed in all theſe daungers and miſfortunes he omitted not anye
thing that might further his eſcaping from the tyrants handes. For
foure tymes he attempted to take ſhipping for Fraunce, before he
coulde bring it to paſſe, hauing euery tyme made conuenient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
defrayed the charges of his ſhipping, and made all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
neceſſarye prouiſion for his voyage, firſt at the towne and
porte of <hi>Auero,</hi> the ſeconde tyme at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the thirde tyme
at <hi>Villa Noua</hi> of <hi>Milfontes,</hi> the fourth tyme at the Hauen of <hi>Sizim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi>
nere <hi>Setuball,</hi> but the number of ſpyes and traytors aſwell <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugalles</hi>
as ſpanyardes was ſo great, and their awayting and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancie
ſo extreme, that theſe the Kinges attemptes were fruſtrated
(although moſte ſecretlye handled,) yea his maieſtie was not farre
from his apprehenſion at what tyme he firſt prepared for his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barquing
at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> for hee was there almoſt entrapped as more
particularly hereafter ſhall be declared. Beſides his maieſty
in the moneth of December ſent ſecretlye into Fraunce <hi>Jerom de
Silua</hi> a gentleman of a noble and auncient houſe to ſignifie vnto
the moſt Chriſtian french King and the moſte excellent princeſſe
the Queene-mother that he was yet liuing and in good healthe,
for that he vnderſtoode, the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had written to many
Princes of chriſtiandome, howe he was dead.</p>
            <p>Nowe when the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> had eſtabliſhed his affaires in
<hi>Portugall</hi> according to his pleaſure, he ſent incontinentlye lettres
to all the townes of <hi>Aphrica,</hi> of the Eaſt Indyes, the country of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſile</hi>
and other countreyes and Iſlandes depending of the Crowne
of <hi>Portugall,</hi> requiring them from thencefoorth to acknowledge
him for their ſoueraigne Lorde and Prince, whiche hee eaſily
obteyned at their handes, by reaſon there ranne a rumour that
Kinge <hi>Anthonie</hi> was deade, and for that they ſawe no lykely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode
how he could euer recouer his kingdom, and beſides theſe
countreis and townes cannot want the traffique of <hi>Portugall</hi> from
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:296:22"/>
whence they haue their prouiſion of victualls, munitions of warre
and other neceſſaries. wherefore in thend they ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
into the king of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> handes more by neceſſitie, then for
any good will. The King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> alſo wrote to the lyke effect to
thiſles of <hi>Aſſores</hi> where at that tyme remayned gouernour <hi>Cipry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Figueredo de Vaſcogoncelos</hi> eſtabliſhed there by king <hi>Sebaſtian</hi>
before his going into <hi>Aphrica,</hi> in reſpect of his great wiſedom and
experience linked with a ſingular and commendable conſtancie
and fortitude of mynde and courage. After good and mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration
had thereupon the ſame gouernour togeather with thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of the Iſlandes anſwered howe they were bounde by
oath to kinge <hi>Anthony,</hi> and in regarde thereof could not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> for their ſoueraigne lord nor do homage
vnto him before they were certainly aduertiſed and ſure that king
<hi>Anthonie</hi> was dead, and therefore reſolued to defende themſelues
againſte all force, (wherewith the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> threatned them)
vntill they ſhould receaue, certen newes of king <hi>Anthonyes</hi> death,
or expreſſe commaundement from him to yeilde them ſelues into
the ſayde king of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> ſubiection and obedience.</p>
            <p>With this anſwere the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> was highly offended, and
therefore within ſhorte ſpace after prepared an armye by ſea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting
to aboute three thouſand men, whereof <hi>Peter Baldez</hi>
was Captaine, who arriued with his nauie well appointed in the
beginning of Iune 1581 neere thiſle of <hi>Tercera</hi> the ſtrongeſt of
of all thiſlandes of <hi>Aſſores,</hi> and albeit the ſame Iſlande remained
vnfurniſhed not onely of ſouldiours but alſo of armour, gunpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and other neceſſaries fit for the warres, yet by <hi>Ciprian Figue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redo</hi>
his vertue and induſtrie (whome the inhabitantes of thiſland
had choſen for their Captayne) thennimie was repulſed with the
loſſe of aboute ſeuen hundred of his ſpanyards all olde ſouldiours
and amongeſt them many of the chiefe gentlemen that firſt ſette
foote on land who were all preſently ſlayne, which ſpectacle caſte
ſuch a feare into the reſt of tharmy remaining in the ſhippes, that
none of them durſt come a lande, inſomuche that <hi>Baldez</hi> with this
foyle was driuen to returne into <hi>Portugall</hi> to his greate ſhame.</p>
            <p>Aboute the ſame tyme, when Kinge <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> was (as is
aforemencioned) come to <hi>Calais,</hi> hee ſtayed not long there, but
paſſed with all expedition into England, from whence he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
diſpatched a Carauell, towarde the ſaide Iſlande of <hi>Tercera</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:296:23"/>
with letters to <hi>Ciprian de Figueredo</hi> aduertiſing him of the ſucceſſe
of his voyage, and howe he was arriued in health in the realme of
England. Vppon the receipte of theſe letters, <hi>Ciprian</hi> himſelfe
and all thinhabitants of thiſlande conceaued ſuche ioy as is ſcant
poſſible to be beleued. For manye of them thought his maieſtie
had bene eyther dead or fallen into thandes of his enemy notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the Conſtable, and <hi>Anthonye de Britto Pimentill</hi> had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
certaine of thiſlanders, (who repaired into Fraunce to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
newes of him) howe his highneſſe was come thither and for
a certaine reſpectt kept himſelfe ſecrete in a Caſtle, whereat thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlanders
greatly reioyced, whome <hi>Cipryan</hi> confirmed in this good
opinion, although he ſuppoſed the ſame to be cunningly inuented
(as in truth it was) by the Conſtable and <hi>Anthonie de Britto</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the people and keepe them in good deuotion toward
his maieſtie, who came not into Fraunce till a good while after.
But it fell ſo out that this was no ſmall furtherance to thobteyning
of the victorie whereof mention is before made. <hi>Ciprian</hi> and the
reſt of thinhabitantes of thiſland ſending backe the carauell to his
highneſſe certified him of the victorie obteyned, which was got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
but two dayes before the comming of the Carauell, offering
their ready ſeruice to ſpend their liues and goodes for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of his maieſties authoritye, and preſeruation of thiſlance as
they had alreadye done. At the retourne of this Carauell into
Englande, Kinge <hi>Anthonie</hi> was there ſtill preparing an Armie
wherewith hee purpoſed to meete the fleete which was to come
that yere to <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Portugall</hi> from theſt and weſt Indies. But
But for aſmuch as it was after knowne to be then to late to execute
thenterpriſe, it remained in ſuſpence, without anye thinge effected
that yere. Wherfore King <hi>Anthonie</hi> departed out of <hi>England</hi> and
in the moneth of October following, arriued at the hauen of <hi>Diepe</hi>
and paſſed from thence to <hi>Parris,</hi> where he was honorably recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
aſwell by the moſt Chriſtian king, as by the Queenemother.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> (conſidering howe greatelye it ſtoode him
vppon to ſubdue the ſaide Ilandes of <hi>Aſſores,</hi> and ſpecially <hi>Tarcera</hi>
as the moſt principalle and chiefeſt amongſt them that hee might
therby better aſſure his nauigation from the Eaſt &amp; Weſt Indies,)
determined to prepare a greate and puiſſant armye by Sea for the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:296:23"/>
yeare following 1582. Vppon notice whereof King <hi>Anthonie</hi>
gaue aduertiſement of the ſame preſently to the queene-mother
She for the repreſſion of the Kinge of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> purpoſe gaue order
for the preparation of another armye by ſea in Fraunce for Kinge
<hi>Anthony,</hi> appoynting her coſen the lorde <hi>Phillip Troſſi</hi> generall of
the ſame, and the countie of <hi>Briſſake</hi> for his lieuetennant. This
armye conſiſted of ſeuen and fiftye ſhippes of warre aſwell great
as ſmall and foure or fiue thouſande ſouldiours, with aboute ſixe
hundred frenche gentlemen of name and armes, and certen <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugalles.</hi>
King <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> determined to goe perſonally in the
ſame armye, to ſee the ſayde Iſlandes of <hi>Aſſores</hi> and thanke his
good and faithfull ſubiectes thinhabitantes of the ſame, for theire
duties and loyaltye thitherto ſhewed vnto him, and withall moſt
principall to maintayne militarye diſcipline amongeſt his ſoldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
meaning alſo by the waye to take thiſle of ſaint <hi>Michaell,</hi>
one of the greateſt of thiſlandes of <hi>Aſſores</hi> and then poſſeſſed by
the Kinge of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> Whereuppon aboute the ende of Iune
1582 his maieſtie ſayled from <hi>Beliſle</hi> with his ſayde armye, and
arriued before ſainct <hi>Michaels</hi> Iſle the three and twentie of Iuly
following, whiche preſentlye yeilded to his highneſſe by reaſon
thinhabitantes were well affectioned towarde him ſauing certen
traytors, who were conſtrayned with the ſpaniardes that lay there
in garriſon to about the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of eyght hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred to flyinto a ſtrong

where his maieſtie was well and humbly receaued by his ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iectes
according to their duties. But the thyrde day after they

and others of aucthoritye, counſelled, and intreated kinge
<hi>Don Anthonye</hi> to abſent himſelfe from the battayle, and to rytire

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:296:24"/>
King was againſt their aduiſe a good while, but in the ende (ouer
come with their reaſons) he reſolued to followe their counſell, and
in a little Carauell together with his agent, <hi>Edward de Castro,</hi> and
certen others was conueyed into the ſaide Iſle of <hi>Tercera,</hi> leauing
in tharmye the Conſtable with aboute two hundred Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galles

            <p>The next daye being the ſixe and twentith of Iulye, the Lorde
<hi>Stroſſi</hi> hauing ſette his armie in order, determined himſelfe firſt of

and hauing ſpent two or three daies in viewing where to land

of his Galleyes which (contrary to many mens opinions) he
brought thither, he landed his men of war in a certaine place, leaſt
ſuſpected by the captaines &amp; inhabitants of thiſland, where remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
but a verie ſmall garrſion. By reaſon whereof it came to paſſe
that before the principall body of the garriſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which was two miles
of, could come thither, then'nimy had leaſure to land almoſt tenne
thouſande fighting men, and had halfe intrenched them. Firſte
therefore <hi>Mounſyr de Chartres</hi> came thyther in all expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with his regimente of Frenchemen and hotlye ſkirmiſhed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:296:25"/>
with the enemies, wherein manye were ſlayne on eyther ſide, but
ſpecially of the Spanyardes. At laſte alſo came therle of <hi>Torres
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>edras</hi> gouernoure of the Iſle with a good number of <hi>Portugall</hi>
ſouldioures and men of the Iſlande well armed and ſufficientlye
trayned. And perceauing in what caſe thinges ſtood, treated with
<hi>Mounſyr de Chartres</hi> touching the ioyning of preſent battayle with
the ennemy. Herevpon they all prepared themſelues to fight, &amp;
the ſquadrons being ſet in order are apoynted to march againſt the
ennemy. But for that the Marquiſe had twice as many men in his
army as were in King <hi>Anthonies,</hi> and alſo it ſeemed very late in the
day to gyue this battayle, the ſayde Erle propounded to <hi>Mounſyr
de Chartres</hi> to differre it tyll the next daye, and that in the meane
ſpace he would cauſe victuals, gunpouder, munition, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
to be brought into a conuenient place amongſt the rockes
of the Iſle, to the intent to make their retraite thither to ſtaye for
ayde out of Fraunce or the other Iſlandes, if they fortuned to looſe
the victory: Alleadging withall that the ennemyes army could not
ſtay long about the ſayd Iſland for want of a hauen, and ſpeciallye
how the galleis could not abyde the Ocean ſea when it began to
ſwell, which happened commonlye about the moneth of Auguſt
then beeing at hand: further how the ennemye with all his armye
could not long remayne there if the commoditye of victuals were
taken from him. When <hi>Mounſyr de Chartres</hi> had conferred with
his captaines about theſe matters, ſome were of aduiſe to giue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
battayle, others and the greater part reſolued with the Erle to
differre it till the next day.</p>
            <p>The Erle beeing aduertiſed of this reſolution, called before him
certayne of the chiefe <hi>Portugall</hi> captaynes, declaring vnto them
what had paſſed in this matter, exhorting them to keepe diligent
watch that night, that none of their ſouldiours departed from the
campe. But when the <hi>Portugals</hi> (who before were willing to
ioyne battayle) vnderſtood the differring of the ſame tyll the next
day, their heartes began to faint, inſomuch that by little and little
they forſooke the campe and wente home to their houſes. Vpon
the vnderſtanding whereof, the Erle diſtruſting the victory, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
him ſelfe about midnight, with ten or twelue of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
out of the campe, to the intent to ſaue him ſelfe by flight (as
appeared afterwardes by certaine barques which he had prepared
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:296:26"/>
for that purpoſe,) yet faining to make preſent returne. But on the
morow after thinking with his companie to be embarked, he was
diſappointed by certaine women dwelling aboute the place,
where the barques laie, who brake them in peeces to ſtop his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage:
Then ſeeing him ſelfe in this aduerſitie and deceiued of his
expectation, he went in diſpaire, and hid himſelfe in the beſt ſort
he could among the rockes.</p>
            <p>Nowe when it was light day, <hi>Mounſir de Chartres</hi> hearing no
newes of therle, and perceiuing howe in a manner all the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galles</hi>
were gone from the camp, thought no other but that therle
had withdrawne himſelfe with his <hi>Portugalls</hi> to the rocks, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his ſpeeche had the daie before: Whereupon preſentlie
the ſaide <hi>Mounſyr de Chartres</hi> ſetting al his men in order of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
marched ſtraight to that place which therle had before nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
vnto him, But foraſmuche as he founde there neither the
ſaide earle, nor victuals and other neceſſaryes which hee had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to conuaie thither, Therefore hee aſſembled all his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and officers with the cheefe of the <hi>Portugalles</hi> which yet
ſtayed in the campe, to conſult what was beſt to be done. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they al concluded how it was beſt to agree with the enimy,
Inſomuche that vpon conference had betweene him and them,
at laſt a concluſion was made, whereby it was lawfull for all the
ſouldiers, aſwell frenchmen, as <hi>Portugalls</hi> to depart with bag and
baggage out of the Iſland, whitherſoeuer they would, leauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them their armor, Enſignes, and Drummes. Alſo the enimie
promiſed to furniſh them with ſhips &amp; victualles for their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.
Howbeit the ſaide earle of <hi>Torres Vedras</hi> and certaine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
borne ſubiectes of thiſle were excepted out of this treatie &amp;
agreement, whoſe pardon thennimie would in no wiſe yeelde to
graunt. After this compoſition thus made, all thiſle was miſerably
ſacked by the ſpace of 3 dais, many of thinhabitants hanged &amp; <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuel
Serradas</hi> beheaded, (who a little before, by king <hi>Anthonies</hi>
commandement had taken &amp; ſacked thiſle of <hi>Caboverde)</hi> neither
could therle of <hi>Torres vedras</hi> eſcape his fortune, for the 3. day after
thagreement made, he was found among the rocks, by meanes of
a maid-ſlaue bewraying him, &amp; therupon was alſo beheaded.</p>
            <p>And although the loſſe of this Iſlande of <hi>Tercera</hi> with thothers
depending therof, was vnto the ſaid king <hi>Don Anthonie</hi> a great &amp;
lamentable misfortune, yet for all that, neuer abating his courage,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:296:26"/>
he hath alwaies repoſed his confidence in God, and thuprightnes
of his iuſt cauſe, hoping by the grace of almighty God, &amp; good aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of Chriſtian princes, at laſt to recouer his kingdom which
the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> hath tirannicallie taken from him, as wee are
taught by many hiſtories, how the raign of tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts laſteth not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g.
And this is the verie reaſon that hitherto the ſaide King <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonie</hi>
hath refuſed all manner of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>poſition with the ſaid king of
<hi>Caſtile,</hi> notwithſtanding he hath had very large offers at his hands
of ſome of the which and ſpecially of the cheefeſt, it ſhall not bee
from the purpoſe here to make reherſall. It is therfore conuenient
to be knowne, how the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> by <hi>Chriſtopher de mora,</hi> his
ambaſſador in <hi>Portugall,</hi> offered vnto <hi>Don Anthonie</hi> yeerely (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was created king), 500 thouſand duckats and the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norſhip

<hi>Emanuell</hi> of <hi>Portugall,</hi> a ſpeciall friend of the ſaid agent, and vncle

the king of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> for the ſurety of her husbands perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular

his agent. It fortuned that within 8. dayes after the ſaide agent ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
hereof, came fecretly to his wife, to thinte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to take order for
the ſaide king <hi>Don Anthonies</hi> firſt ſhipping, which he thought to

from thence in a ſecrete place (where he was to ſtay) til al thinges
were ready for his embarking, in a ſhip which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnladed at <hi>Lisbo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:296:27"/>
beeing couertly ſent thither for that purpoſe, by the ſayde queene
mother, with maiſter <hi>Peter Dor</hi> a gentleman of great wiſedome,
and diſcretion, who alwayes had been well inclyned to King <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonies</hi>
ſide, and had expreſſe commaundement to inquyre whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were dead or alyue. Now when the ſayde King <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonie</hi>
vnderſtoode by his Agent what <hi>Ieronimo de Mendoza</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
from the king of <hi>Castil,</hi> he was very vnwilling to conſent
that his ſayde Agent ſhoulde enter into any communication with
him, fearing it was but a drift to entrap his ſayde Agent and yeelde
him priſoner into the King of <hi>Caſtiles</hi> handes, but yet the ſayde A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
more regarding the Kinges preſeruation then his owne ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
very earneſtly intreted his maieſty to permit him to confer with
the ſayd, <hi>Ieronimo,</hi> ſith it woulde bee a good meane to further his
highnes embarquing, which was in hand to be prepared. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muche
that Kinge <hi>Don Anthonie</hi> at laſte conſented therevnto.
Therefore the next day the ſayde Agent ſignified aſwell to <hi>Jeroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
de Mendoza,</hi> as to <hi>Emanuell</hi> of <hi>Portugall</hi> that he was come to
his wyfe to the place afore ſayde, and therefore they might come
and declare what they had to ſaye. Firſt therefore came <hi>Emanuell</hi>
the next day to the ſayde Agent, and they concluded to meet <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza</hi>
the daye following in a place halfe a myle from the ſayde A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
houſe. Now at the howre appoynted meeting togeather,
the ſayd <hi>Mendoza</hi> declared to the ſayd Agent how the King of
<hi>Caſtile</hi> woulde giue vnto <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> the Kingdome of Naples,
vpon condition that he would yeeld himſelfe into his handes, and
renounce his right &amp; action which he pretended to the kingdome
of <hi>Portugall,</hi> promiſing alſo large recompence on the King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiles</hi>
behalfe to the ſayde Agent in caſe he could procure king <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>
to accept this offer. Herevpon the ſayd Agent to lengthen
this buſines and winne tyme, fained he knew not where King <hi>Don
Anthonio</hi> was, but yet told <hi>Mendoza</hi> he was well content to break
the matter to his maiſter aſſoone as he could vnderſtand where to
finde him, alleadging how his maieſtie neuer ſtayed two dayes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather
in one place. At which communication the ſayd <hi>Ieronimo
de Mendoza</hi> made earneſt entreatie to go in the company of the
ſayde Agent to conferre with <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> when it ſhoulde bee
knowne where he was. Whereof the ſayde Agent did put him in
good hope and helde him in ſuſpence about the ſpace of twentye
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:296:27"/>
daies ſpace, applying neuertheleſſe in the meane time the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
of his maieſties ſhipping, which beeing readie the ſaide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
returned to king <hi>Anthony,</hi> certifying <hi>Mendoza</hi> thereof, and
ſending him word how he would with ſpeed, aduertiſe him what
reſolution the ſaide king <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> tooke in thoſe matters
which the ſaid <hi>Mendoza</hi> had propounded. But the ſaid agent
thought nothing leſſe then to returne to <hi>Mendoza,</hi> fearing leaſt he
wold by ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce either deteine him captiue or not leaue til he
had brought him to king <hi>Don Anthonie.</hi> Moreouer the king of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi>
commaunded manie other moſt ample and beneficiall offers
to be made on his behalfe to king <hi>Don Anthony,</hi> after his arriuall
in Fraunce, yea and after the taking of thiſle of <hi>Tercera,</hi> which for
breuities ſake are here omitted.</p>
            <p>Nowe when kinge <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> vnderſtoode what offer
<hi>Mendoza</hi> propounded vnto him, he made none account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
but went by night with his agent, and others of his traine to a
ſecrete place not farre from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> adioyning neere the ſea, there
ſtaying for a barke which was to come from the ſaide citie of <hi>Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi>
to carrie him aboard the ſhip wherein hee was to ſaile away.
This barke was partlie prepared by the care and diligence of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
de Alpoen</hi> Doctor of the lawes, a man of great learning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie
hauing alwaies conſtantlie maintained king <hi>Don Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
cauſe, wherein hee purpoſed himſelfe with certaine of his
freendes and kinred to meete king <hi>Anthonie</hi> and paſſe into France
with him. But this matter being diſcouered by the treſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of one <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
de Oliuera</hi> (to whoſe charge king <hi>Anthonie</hi> had alſo committed
this buſineſſe) certaine gallies of <hi>Caſtile</hi> lying in waite for the ſaid
barke in the ſea, in the place where it was to paſſe, aſſaulted and
tooke it, wherein <hi>Peter de Alpoen</hi> with his vncle and nephue, and
two religious men, and certaine other perſons were taken, and all
put to the torture to confeſſe whither they went. But it happened
by Gods permiſſion that before the barke was taken, <hi>Baſtian Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uera</hi>
(one of the Kings ſeruauntes afore mentioned) paſſed along
the ſea ſide to ſeeke for his maieſtie, and ſpied the Gallies there
diſpearſed about the ſame place where the barke (that his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſtaied for) was to paſſe. And brought preſent word therof to
his highneſſe, who immediatlie tooke horſe and in great haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torned
with his companie to his accuſtomed pilgrimage vntill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:296:28"/>
two moneths after it was his hap to be embarqued in deede
&amp; to come into Fraunce as is afore declared.</p>
            <p>This alſo is not to bee omitted in this place, howe king <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio</hi>
in his paſſage from <hi>Lisbon</hi> towarde Fraunce, was driuen by
contrary winde about two hundred leagues from land toward the
weſt, where hee met a great and mightie ſhip of warre, whereof
<hi>Ambroſe de Guyar</hi> was captain, who had the conduction, of aboute
300 Spaniſh ſouldiers, to place in garriſons in the ſaid Iſle of Saint
Michael. This ſhip (as the manner is) had a carauel with her, which
came to aboard the ſhip wherein his maieſtie was. The men of the
carauel demanded of the maſter of his highneſſe ſhip, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence
they came, he anſwered from <hi>Calice</hi> in <hi>Andalouſie.</hi> Being demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
what newes there, he aunſwered, how the people died of the
plague, &amp; ſome of his mariners were alreadie deade &amp; others yet
very ſick of the ſame diſeaſe: Vpon thunderſtanding whereof, they
of the carauell abandoned the kinges ſhip, taking their courſe to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ward
the ſaid ſhip of warre.</p>
            <p>When the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> vnderſtood how King <hi>Anthony</hi> was
arriued in Fraunce, he was ſo highlie offended therewith, that hee
cauſed <hi>Peter Dalpoen</hi> to be forthwith beheaded, and his vncle and
nephue to be perpetually baniſhed the realm, condemning the 2.
religiouſe men to the gallies, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuertheleſſe afterward (chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
his ſentence) he condemned to cloſe priſon for manie yeres.
cauſing the wife of King <hi>Anthonies</hi> agent, with his children &amp; his
coſens (of whom he had the bringing vp) and his mother in Law,
&amp; 3. religious ſiſters of his, of thorder of S. <hi>Clare,</hi> to be all brought
into <hi>Caſtile,</hi> &amp; put into diuerſe monaſteryes. Likewiſe appointing
to be brought into the ſaid kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Caſtile</hi> the Counteſſe of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mioſo</hi>
mother of the ſaid conſtable with 3. ſonnes and 7. daughters,
together with the wife of <hi>Emanuel de ſilua,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gouernor of the ſaid
Iſle of <hi>Tercera,</hi> whom he detained there vntill the ſaid Conſtable
&amp; <hi>Emanuel de ſilua</hi> had loſt their liues, as is afore mentioned.
Alſo it is not to be paſſed in ſilence, how the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> euen
ſince king <hi>Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Anthony</hi> arriued in fraunce, hath vſed al practiſes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
to procure the ſaid king <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> his couſin germaine, to
be murdered, ſending many caſtilians and <hi>Portugalls</hi> into Fraunce
for that ſpeciall purpoſe. Of which the firſt &amp; chiefe was, <hi>Edward
de Caſtro,</hi> a man of baſe birth, though very rich, a portugal borne,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:296:28"/>
who notwithſtandinge had in former time done much good and
faithfull ſeruice to King <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> in <hi>Portugal.</hi> This man fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
himſelf to be malcontent toward the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
him priſoner a certain time, came into France to K. <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
to whome at his firſt comming (for the better cloaking of his
treaſon) he declared how for his deliuery out of priſon, he had pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſed
the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> to aſſay by all manner of meanes to kill
the ſaid King <hi>Don Anthonie:</hi> Or if he could not bring that to paſſe,
how at leaſt he would finde the meane to procure certaine french
companies or other ſtrange ſouldiers (ouer whome he hoped to be
appointed captaine) to riſe againſt his maieſty at ſuch time as hee
ſhould be readie to ioine battail, or in hand to execute any like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe,
or elſe would do ſome ſuch thing as ſhould caſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and campe of the ſaid King <hi>Anthony</hi> into ſome notable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
wherein the very trueth is, his meaning was to haue kept pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
with the ſaid King of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> For it came to paſſe within a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
after, when King <hi>Anthony</hi> was ouercome in a ſea-battail at the
Iſle of S. <hi>Michael,</hi> while the Marquiſſe of S. <hi>Croſſe</hi> remained in the
ſame Iſle, that the ſaid <hi>Edward de Castro</hi> being with King <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
in thiſlle of <hi>Tercera,</hi> earneſtlie perſwaded the french companies
which were there in garriſon (whome he had won to him by gifts
and otherwiſe) that the <hi>Portugalls</hi> went aboute to murther them
all ſuddenlie, ſhewing to them for proofe thereof a letter written
by King <hi>Anthonies</hi> agente, which (though falſelie) he vouched to
containe ſuch matter, and likewiſe made the portugalles on the
contrariſide beleeue, howe they were in the like daunger at the
Frenche mens handes. When he had laid this foundation, he went
aboute to put the matter in execution, and ſo handled the ſame
that one day the Frenchmen firſt made them readie to ſet vpon
the portugalles and ſlewe <hi>Anthony Baracho</hi> a gentleman of por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal.
But as eche party began to put themſelues in armes, it came
to paſſe by the great dexteritie and wiſedome of a portugall Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
who in time ſmelled this treaſon, that the matter proceeded
no further, but all was well pacified &amp; the Traitour apprehended.
Who vppon the falling out of the matter otherwiſe then he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
woulde preſentlie haue retired into the ſaide Iſle of S. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaell,
to the Marquis of Sayncte Croſſe in an Engliſhe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:296:29"/>
ſhip which he had hired for that purpoſe for a great ſome of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie.
Thus the traitor being taken &amp; conuict of his treaſon aſwel
by his owne confeſſion in the priſon, as openlie vpon the ſcaffold,
was at laſt beheaded. Yet the ſaide king <hi>Don Antonie</hi> in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce
and conſideration of his former ſeruices, would haue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
him had not the common people &amp; ſouldiers made great
inſtance for the open puniſhment of ſo great &amp; dangerous a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
About the ſame time <hi>Sebaſtian Caruaillo</hi> another <hi>Portugal</hi> was
executed in the ſaid Iſle of <hi>Tercera</hi> for enterpriſing to kil the ſaid
king <hi>Don Anthonio.</hi> Alſo for the like cauſe, a Caſtilian gentleman
of thorder of the knightes of <hi>Malta,</hi> was afterwardes executed in
Fraunce, Further, for the like offence, <hi>Iohn Franciſco,</hi> and <hi>John Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drigues
deſoſa</hi> were priſoners in France, and vpon their conuiction
were ſent in captiuitie to the ſaid Iſlande of <hi>Tercera</hi> a little before
the taking thereof, by means whereof they recouered their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
contrary to their deſarts, But the ſaide <hi>Iohn Rodrigues</hi> had neuer
eſcaped from execution in France, had not the moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
the Queene of England (with whom he had beene king <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonies</hi>
Ambaſſadour) made interceſſion for him.</p>
            <p>Whoſoeuer therefore ſhall rightlye conſider all theſe daungers
and greate inconueniencies whiche the ſaide King <hi>Don Anthonio</hi>
hath endured and eſcaped, may eaſilye iudge that all this came not
to paſſe without gods peculier prouidence and diuine ſufferance &amp;
that ſome great matter of importance is hid thereunder, namely a
great hope is to be conceaued therof, that almightie God, will vſe
the ſayd king <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> as a fit inſtrument, to breake the great
powre &amp; force of the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> wherby through his exceſſiue
and vnmeaſurable ambition, he would elſe in tract of tyme, inuade
not onely all chriſtiandom, but alſo al the reſt of the worlde, &amp; that
vnder the faire colour of maintaining the Catholike Romiſh reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
vnder pretence whereof he hath thus manye yeeres afflicted
thinhabitantes of the lowe countreys, otherwiſe a good and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
people, that in former tyme had alwayes bene good &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſubiects to him &amp; his aunceſtors: to thintent that vpon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to his fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſie, he might eaſily &amp; freely ſpred
his armies ouer England, Germany, France &amp; other nations, either
for that they receiue, or at leaſt permit in their countries any other
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> only the catholike Romiſh religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or els vnder ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:296:29"/>
kinde of pretence whatſoeuer. This is the marke he ſhooteth
at &amp; wil eaſily hitte except thother chriſtian Princes (before theuill
creepe any further,) haue ſpeciall regard to oppoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to his
power &amp; force by ayding the prouinces vnited of the lowe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
nowe greately afflicted, and alſo and that moſt ſpecially, the
ſayde Kinge <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> who with thayde of ſome reaſonable
nauie of ten or twelue thouſande men furniſhed with victualles,
munition, and other neceſſaries, may in ſhorte tyme without anye
greate difficultie recouer his kingdome. Whereunto thincredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
affection which the <hi>Portugalls</hi> beare alwayes to their King &amp;
naturall prince, together with thauncient hatred they haue alwaies
borne to the Caſtilians their auncient ennemyes, woulde ſerue for
a greate furtherance. As the lyke meane ſerued the prince of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranges
for a greate effect in the ſayde lowe countreyes, to maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
warres there ſo longe againſt the forces of the ſayd Kinge
of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> Further if King <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> had recouered <hi>Portugall</hi> &amp;
driuen away the caſtilians, he might alſo eaſily in ſhort time aſwel
reduce into his power and dominion the townes of <hi>Aphrica</hi> with
the townes and countreys of the Eaſte Indies, and Braſile (where
the garriſons conſiſt all of naturall Portugalles) as alſo take from
the king of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> his power by ſea conſiſting chiefely of <hi>Portugal</hi>
ſhippes &amp; Marriners. Who without doubte for the naturall affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
they beare towarde their Kinge and Countrey, and the rather
bicauſe their wiues, children, landes, and goodes remaine in Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall:
and for the naturall hatred they beare to the Caſtilians (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whome they ſerue againſt their willes) will eaſilye come and
yeilde themſelues to the ſayde King <hi>Don Anthonie,</hi> as wee haue
ſeene the lyke example in the ſayde lowe countreys, when the
wars began, for the driuing away of the ſpanyardes. Alſo it is to be
noted, how the people of <hi>Portugall</hi> beare a generall hatred againſt
the king of <hi>Caſtile</hi> &amp; his Caſtilians not onely in reſpect of their aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
enmitye againſt the ſayde Caſtilians but alſo and moſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
for the greate iniuries and indignities which they haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
at their handes ſince the ſayde King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> by force &amp; vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
poſſeſſed their countrey. Whereby all mens mindes are ſo
bent and inflamed againſt him and his Caſtilians, that their chiefe
wiſhe and expectation is for the ſayde kinge <hi>Don Anthonie</hi> (by the
ayde of ſome Princes) to enter into <hi>Portugall</hi> with an armie, not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:296:30"/>
onely for their deliuery from the yoke &amp; bondage of the Caſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
(whoſe garriſons there exceede not the number of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
men) but alſo to inuade <hi>Castile</hi> in reuenge of the ſaid iniuries
whereinto there is long &amp; wide acceſſe and entry out of <hi>Portugall</hi>
without any ſtrong place to hinder free paſſage into the ſaid king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> Moreouer the hatred of the <hi>Portugalles</hi> againſt the
Caſtilians, is growne ſo far, that they which before were addicted
to the ſaid King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and corrupted with money &amp; promiſes
to deliuer their natiue country into his handes, do nowe ſecretly
fauour King <hi>Don Anthonio,</hi> auouching how they will rather yeilde
their liues &amp; goodes to his maieſties mercye, then liue any longer
vnder the tyranny of the King of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> Who hath them in no eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
neither will perform what he promiſed when he ſolicited
them to be authors to procure him the kingdome.</p>
            <p>Although all men know how ſmalle accompte the king of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi>
maketh to fulfill his promiſes to ſuche men as he hath vſed in
like kind of affaires, &amp; moſt ſpecially when he hath no more neede
of them: yet it ſhalbe worth the noting in this place, how hee hath
dealt with them that were the principall authors to bring his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſo eaſilye to paſſe in <hi>Portugall.</hi> Theſe men, when King <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonio</hi>
was ouercom &amp; diſcomfited, &amp; the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> in peace
able poſſeſſion of the Kingdome of <hi>Portugall,</hi> &amp; of the realmes lands
&amp; countreis depending therof (ſauing onely the ſaid Iſlands of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſores</hi>
which held a good while as is afore recited for king <hi>Anthony)</hi>
exhibited a ſupplication to the ſaide King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> declaring at
large their ſeruices done in his behalfe for thobteining of the ſaid
Kingdome of Portugall, beſeeching his maieſtie to voutchſafe the
performance of thoſe promiſes which his ambaſſadors, the Duke
of <hi>Oſſuna</hi> and <hi>Chriſtofer de Mora</hi> had made vnto them on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe,
exhibiting writings withall to prooue the ſaide ambaſſadors
promiſes. Wherunto the King commaunded anſwere to be giuen,
that this ſupplycation with thambaſſadors writing, ſhould be ſent
to his counſell called in the Portugall language, <hi>Meſa da conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.</hi>
Wherupon followed a decree touching that matter, of the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
or effect enſuing <hi>Foraſmuch as the king of</hi> Caſtile, <hi>is true inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the kingdom of</hi> Portugal: <hi>it was not lawfull for the ſuppliants to ſel
the ſame for gifts nor promiſes, but rather they had incurred the penal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty
of death for th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of their own accord, &amp; without theſe promiſes, they
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:296:30"/>
deliuered not the kingdom to the ſaid king of</hi> Caſtile: <hi>But if the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
perteyned to</hi> Don Anthonio, <hi>then they could not ſell it to king</hi>
Phillip, <hi>wherfore the king was no way bound to performe the promiſes
which thambaſſadors made to the ſuppliants, but of his benignity and
clemencye hee abſolueth the ſupplyants from the capitall puniſhment,
whereunto for this cauſe they had endaungered them ſelues.</hi> A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
reward ſurely, yea &amp; that ſuch a one, as commonlye all tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
receaue, &amp; as the King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> accuſtometh to beſtow vpon
all them that doe him ſeruice in like affaires; Which may ſerue for
an example to all men, that for giftes or promiſes they attempt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
againſt their dutie nor conſciences. For God is a iuſt iudge
that neuer leaueth wickednes vnpuniſhed, nor well doeing vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced.</p>
            <p>Syth therefore it manifeſtly appeareth by the premiſſes, that the
fayd King <hi>Don Anthonio</hi> hath a rightfull &amp; moſt iuſt cauſe: it is to
be wiſhed, that al chriſtian princes or the more part of them would
of their owne accordes, offer them ſelues to aide &amp; ſuccour him to
recouer his Kingdom whereof he is ſo vniuſtlye and tyrannouſlye
ſpoyled by the king of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> as it alſo appertayneth to all princes
to helpe them that be afflicted and oppreſſed by tyranny. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
truly they ought to be the more forwarde and mooued, for
that it ſeemeth the onely waye and meane to deliuer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
and their poſteritye from the tyrannye of the
Spanyardes, whiche otherwiſe in the ende
they ſhall hardelye auoyde, as more
particulerlye hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
in this treatiſe.</p>
