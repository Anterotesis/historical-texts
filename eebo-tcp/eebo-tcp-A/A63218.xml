            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO the end that all Impartial People may have a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the preſent Proſecution, I intend to give a ſhort Relation of the firſt riſe, and cauſe, and ground of this preſent Difference, and Perſecution.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1689. by the good Providence of God <hi>George Keith</hi> was earneſtly invited to remove from his Plantation in <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey,</hi> to keep a School in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which he did; but kept an Uſher, and ſpent a great part of his time in Reading, Meditation, Viſiting Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and anſwering the Conſcientious Doubts and Queſtions of many People; and there was a more than ordinary ſeeming Satisfaction in general among the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they were ſo favoured with the aſſiſtance of <hi>George Keith.</hi> But alas! this great love was but ſhort-liv'd; and as in other Caſes one Extream begets the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ſo in this; for their love and reſpects to him were never ſo great, but now the Envy and Hatred of many exceeds; and that upon the account of his Chriſtian Teſtimony. For it was but a little time that he had been amongſt us, and preached the true Faith of Chriſt, both without and within, but ſome began to be diſſatisfied, and whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered it about in private, which, when he came to underſtand, he laboured in much love and tenderneſs to undeceive and ſatisfie thoſe that he came to know were diſſatisfied; and ſome did receive good Satisfaction; but others caſt his Labours of Love behind their backs; and much whiſpering and back-biting there were in private againſt the Doctrine held forth by <hi>G. K.</hi> and ſome began to contradict his Teſtimony in publick Meetings; but yet this were born with, and no open Difference until one <hi>William Stockdale</hi> accuſed <hi>Geo. Keith</hi> of <hi>Preaching Two Chriſts,</hi> becauſe he held forth (as neceſſary to our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) <hi>The Faith of Chriſt as he died for our Sins, roſe again for our Juſtification, and aſcended into Heaven, and is in Heaven in the true and intire glorified Nature of Man, our Mediator with the Father;</hi> and alſo, <hi>That Chriſt was ſpiritually preſent by his Light and Life, in all his Children.</hi> Whereupon he dealt with him, and endeavoured much to convince him, but not prevailing, <hi>G. K.</hi> laid it before a Meeting of <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the Miniſtry, but they did nothing in the matter, but <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 span">

and contradict <hi>G. K.</hi> in his Doctrine. Whereupon <hi>G. K.</hi> did again renew his complaint to them of the Miniſtry at the Yearly Meeting at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> the 7th Month, 1691. deſiring to know their ſence and judgment, <hi>viz. Whether to preach Faith in Chriſt within us, and Faith in Chriſt without us, was to preach Two Chriſts, or One?</hi> and ſix Meeting were held in debate about this matter, and yet nothing done in it: So this paſt on, and ſome Months after <hi>Tho. Fitzwater</hi> openly in a Monthly Meeting accuſed <hi>G. Keith, That he denied the ſufficiency of the Light;</hi> which <hi>G. K.</hi> denied, but <hi>T. F.</hi> ſaid, <hi>he would prove it at the next Monthly Meeting;</hi> which being come, <hi>G. K.</hi> called on <hi>T. Fitzwater</hi> to prove his Charge, which he endeavoured to do, and brought <hi>W. Stockdale</hi> for his Evidence, but to no purpoſe, only <hi>W. Stockdale</hi> again renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Charge againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> in the open Meeting, to the admiration of many, to ſee his great Ignorance and Impudence; but ſeeing that <hi>T. F.</hi> was not like to prove his Charge againſt <hi>G. K. Thomas Lloyd,</hi> and ſome few others withdrew, yet the generality of the Meeting ſtayed, and after ſome time it growing dark, <hi>John Jennet,</hi> (a great ſtickler againſt <hi>G. K.)</hi> deſired that the Meeting might be adjourned till the next day, which was unanimouſly agreed unto, and alſo by <hi>Tho. Fitzwater;</hi> the next day all Parties appeared, and great and long Contention there was moſt part of that day betwixt <hi>George Keith</hi> and <hi>Tho. Lloyd, Arthur Cook,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>G. K.</hi> affirming and arguing for the <hi>Neceſſity of the Faith of Chriſt crucified, &amp;c.</hi> the others denying, and arguing, <hi>That the Light within was ſufficient without the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> &amp;c. but finding that the ſtream went againſt them, <hi>T. Lloyd, A. Cook,</hi> and ſome others withdrew, and the Meeting (conſiſting of at leaſt Sixty Monthly-Meeting Members) proceeded and gave Judgment againſt <hi>T. Fitzwater</hi> and <hi>W. Stockdale,</hi> the ſubſtance of which was, <hi>That they ſhould forbear preaching and praying in Meetings till they had condemned their Ignorance and Unbelief,</hi> &amp;c. but at the next Quarterly Meeting, a Party with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the ſaid Judgments, and ſaid, <hi>That the Perſons being Miniſters, none but them of the Miniſtry were fit to judge;</hi> which many thought reliſht too much of <hi>Popery;</hi> yet notwithſtanding many ſhowed their diſlike thereto, <hi>Tho, Lloyd, Arthur Cook, Sam. Jenings,</hi> &amp;c. denied the ſaid Meeting and Judgment; and then it was that <hi>T. Lloyd</hi>'s Party changed their time and place of meeting againſt and contrary to the declared mind of their then Brethren, who gave their Reaſons why they conſented not to the changing the Time and Place of Meeting; but prevailed nothing with them, for the next firſt Day <hi>George Keith</hi> and Party met at the uſual time and place, and <hi>Tho. Lloyd</hi> and Party went to the Meeting-houſe at the Centre, which made the firſt Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Now the Difference being thus far advanced, cauſed much
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43068:3"/>
diſcourſe and enquiry into the matter by all ſorts of People, and great flocking to Meetings there was, both in Town and Country, where <hi>G. K.</hi> came, and his Teſtimony had much reception in the Hearts of many; which being perceived by <hi>Tho. Lloyd</hi> and Party, the only Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient they could deviſe, was to condemn <hi>G. K.</hi> Whereupon the 20th of the 4th Mon. 1692. Twenty Eight of them called Miniſters, met together at <hi>Philadelphia</hi> and without ever ſo much as acquainting <hi>G. K.</hi> publiſhed a Paper of Judgment againſt him, condemning him as a <hi>Perſon without the fear of God before his Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. which done, <hi>Thomas Lloyd, Samuel Jenings, Arthur Cook, John Delavall,</hi> and others, made it their buſineſs to follow <hi>G. K.</hi> from Meeting to Meeting, violently oppoſing his Teſtimony, and ſometimes making uſe of their Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Power to effect their Deſigns, which cauſed great Conteſts and Confuſions; and <hi>G. K.</hi> from time to time complaining of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, for condemning of him without all Hearing or Trial, upon a time in <hi>Chester-County Tho. Lloyd</hi> ſaid, <hi>George, if thou thinkeſt thy ſelf aggrieved by that Judgment, there is relief for thee; thou mayſt appeal to the Yearly Meeting, which is now approaching;</hi> which Advice <hi>G. K.</hi> followed, and made an Appeal to the ſaid Yearly Meeting, and propoſed twelve particular Heads to be conſidered, diſcourſed of, and reſolved by the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> at the ſaid Yearly Meeting, and that they might have timely notice of the ſaid Appeal, and be the better prepared to anſwer it, <hi>G. K.</hi> procured the ſaid <hi>Appeal</hi> to be printed. Which was no ſooner done, but they iſſued forth a Warrant, and apprehended <hi>William Bradford</hi> the Printer, and <hi>John M”comb,</hi> who (as they were informed) had diſpoſed of two of the ſaid Papers, and committed the ſaid <hi>W. B.</hi> and <hi>J. M.</hi> to Goal; and alſo ſeized all the ſaid Papers they could meet with, and took away a good quantity of <hi>W. Bradford</hi>'s <hi>Letters,</hi> tending to the diſabling of him to work for his Wife and Children; and upon pretence of another Warrant granted without any Conviction, Signed by <hi>Samuel Jenings</hi> and <hi>Robert Ewer</hi> Juſtices, <hi>John White</hi> the Sheriff took Goods out of the Shop of <hi>Will. Bradford,</hi> half as much more as the ſaid Warrant was for. Whether theſe Actions are moſt like to the poor deſpiſed and perſecuted <hi>Quakers,</hi> or their Perſecutors, is left to all impartial People to judge.</p>

            <p>Now though they had got theſe two poor Men into Goal, and tho' all ſober People did reſent their Proceedings very ill, and as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a cruel Spirit of Perſecution; yet the next day they met again, in order to proceed againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> and ſeveral other Perſons in the like manner, and ſent for two other Juſtices that were not called <hi>Quakers,</hi> to aſſiſt them in this work of proſecuting ſeveral ſeditious and dangerous Perſons, that were like to ſubvert the Government, as they pretended; but contrary to their Expectation, the ſaid two Juſtices that were not called <hi>Quakers,</hi> viz. <hi>Lacy Cook</hi> a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> and <hi>John Holme</hi> a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> declared their diſſent from them in theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, ſignifying, <hi>That the matter was a Religious Difference among themſelves,</hi> (viz. the Quakers) <hi>and did not relate to the Government; John Holme</hi> particularly adviſing them <hi>to ſend for</hi> Geo. Keith, <hi>and let him interpret his own words; and upon a hearing of him, if it any way appears that he ſtrikes at the Government, I will</hi> (ſaid Juſtice <hi>Holme) joyn with you againſt him with Heart and Hand.</hi> But this Advice had no weight with them; whereupon the ſaid two Juſtices left them, and our New modelled Perſecuting <hi>Quakers</hi> being warmly bent to root out Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion forſooth! proceeded in their Work, and as they had judged <hi>G.

                           <hi>WHereas the Government of this Province, being by the late King of</hi> England'<hi>s peculiar Favour veſted, and ſithence continued in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi> Penn, <hi>who thought fit to make his and our worthy Friend</hi> Thomas Lloyd <hi>his Deputy Governour, by and under whom the Magiſtrates do act in this Government. And whereas it hath been proved before us, that</hi> George Keith <hi>being a Reſident here, did, contrary to his Duty, publickly revile the ſaid Deputy Governour, calling him an impudent Man, telling him he was not fit to be Governour, and that his Name would stink, with many other ſlighting and abuſive Expreſſions, both to him and the Magiſtrates; and he that uſeth ſuch Exorbitancy of Speech towards the ſaid Governour, may be ſuppoſed will eaſily dare to call the Members of Council and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates Impudent Raſcals, as he hath lately called one in an open Aſſembly, that was conſtituted by the Proprietary to be a Magiſtrate. And he alſo charges the Magiſtrates, who are Miniſters here, with engroſſing the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratical Power into their Hands, that they might uſurp Authority over him, ſaying alſo, He hoped in God he ſhould ſhortly ſee their Power taken from them; which he acted in a moſt indecent manner. And further, the ſaid</hi> G. K. <hi>with ſeveral of his Adherents, having ſome few days ſince, with an unuſual Inſolency, by a printed Sheet, called</hi> an Appeal, &amp;c. <hi>Traduced, and vilely miſrepreſented the Induſtry, Care, Readineſs and Vigilancy of ſome Magiſtrates, and others here, in their late Proceedings against ſome Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers,</hi> viz. Babit <hi>and his Crew, in order to bring them to Condign Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby to diſcourage ſuch Attempts for the future; and hath thereby alſo defamed and arraigned the Determinations of Provincial Judicatory againſt Murtherers; and not only ſo, but by a wrong Inſinuation have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to poſſeſs the Readers of their Pamphlet, That it is inconſistent for thoſe who are Ministers of the Goſpel to act as Magiſtrates.—</hi>

               <hi>Note,</hi> There being an Anſwer to this Proclamation publiſhed in Print by <hi>O. R.</hi> and <hi>T. B.</hi> I ſhall only in this place make the following Obſervations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> They ſay, <hi>At a private Seſſions, &amp;c.</hi> and then relate a Preamble of the <hi>Government being veſted in</hi> W. Penn, <hi>who had made</hi> T. Lloyd <hi>his Deputy, &amp;c.</hi> Did they think to tell us News in this? Or did they think we had forgot <hi>Thomas Lloyd</hi> was Deputy-Governour? Surely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks not the latter, ſince we have been ſo ſmartly remembred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by his Agent <hi>White,</hi> who (when they could not effect their late great Tax) <hi>[Here the Copy being blotted, it could not be read.]</hi> ſo that one would think that Paſſage might have been ſpared: Oh, but 'tis plain their end therein is to inſinuate, <hi>That</hi> Geo. Keith <hi>being legally and judicially brought before the Governour to anſwer to ſome heinous Crime and Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, and that a multitude of People were preſent to hear how he could anſwer for himſelf;</hi> (for they ſay, <hi>publickly reviled, &amp;c.) yet this</hi> G. K. <hi>like a rude man, tho' he pretends to be a Minister, was ſo far from behaving himſelf before the Governour like a Chriſtian, that he fell a reviling him, and amongſt other ſcandalous Expreſſions, ſaid to him, Thou impudent Man,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:43068:5"/>
               <hi>thou art not fit to be Governour, thy Name will ſtink.</hi> Certainly their drift was to poſſeſs their Readers with this Belief, as is clear and evident from their following ſuppoſition, or rather ſuggeſtion, where they ſay, <hi>He that uſeth ſuch Exorbitancy of Speech to the Governor, will eaſily dare to call the Members of Council and Magiſtrates Impudent Raſcals, as he hath lately called one in an open Aſſembly, who was conſtituted by the Governour to be a Magiſtrate.</hi> Which alſo is a baſe and wicked Inſinuation; for <hi>George Keith</hi> never ſpoke thoſe words to any of them as Magiſtrates or Officers in the Government, neither did he ever ſpeak to the preſent Governour all thoſe words together, as is inſinuated by the ſaid Paper, but on the contrary, what he ſpoke to <hi>Tho. Lloyd</hi> was in Monthly Meetings and Religious Controverſies; and <hi>T. Lloyd</hi> hath ſaid ſeveral times, <hi>That he would take no advantage by words ſpoke at ſuch times;</hi> but we find them practiſe the contrary; for on a certain time <hi>T. L.</hi> ſtood up, and affirmed, <hi>That</hi> G. K. <hi>was guilty of Contradiction;</hi> and being put to prove it, ſaid, <hi>That fifteen years ago in his printed Books he owned the Seed to be Chriſt.</hi> Whereupon <hi>G. K.</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou impudent man, I do not deny it now, but own it as much as ever.</hi> But by all the diligent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry that I have made, I cannot find that <hi>G. K.</hi> ſaid, he was not fit to be Governour, <hi>[Here the Copy being blotted, it could not be read.]</hi> ſecond Chapter of the Laws of this Province, <hi>That all Officers and Perſons commiſſioned and employed in the Government, ſhall be ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and declare, They believe in Jeſus Chriſt to be the Son of God the Saviour of the World,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>[Here agian the Copy was blotted.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to <hi>G. K.</hi> ſaying, <hi>That his Name would ſtink, T. L.</hi> knows in his Conſcience, that it was ſpoke to him only as he was one of the 28 unjuſt Judges for giving of falſe Judgment againſt him, and that without all hearing or trial. And as touching the Perſon whom they ſay he call'd <hi>Impudent Raſcal,</hi> it was one whom he knew not to be conſtituted, as they ſay he was; but his Brother being ſo conſtituted, and refuſing to ſerve, the People of the Town choſe him in his Brothers ſtead to ſerve as a Magiſtrate within that Town Bounds, which was altogether unknown to <hi>G. K.</hi> and therefore <hi>Paul</hi>'s Excuſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 4. <hi>I wiſt not Brethren that it was the High Priest,</hi> might be an Apology for him. But let us conſider the word <hi>Raſcal;</hi> according to <hi>Goldman</hi>'s Dictionary, a <hi>Raſcal</hi> is a <hi>Brawler</hi> and <hi>Empty Talker,</hi> and <hi>one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth his Neighbour by falſe and weak Arguments;</hi> and <hi>Cole</hi> in his <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> and <hi>Engliſh Dictionary</hi> ſaith, the Latin word <hi>Nebulo</hi> comet of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>They commit Villany;</hi> and as <hi>Gouldman</hi> in his Dictionary ſaith, a <hi>Villain</hi> and a <hi>Raſcal</hi> is of the ſame Signification. But this Perſon whom they mention went about to deceive his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by falſe and weak Arguments, <hi>viz. That he did not expect to be ſaved by that which died at</hi> Jeruſalem; <hi>And that God was not preſent in all his Creatures;</hi> which Unchriſtian and Atheiſtical Principles <hi>G. K.</hi> being about to refute in a Monthly Meeting, and holding forth, <hi>That God was preſent in all his Creatures,</hi> this Perſon ſtood up, and with much oppoſition queſtioning, as <hi>Paul</hi>'s Fool did about the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, ſaid in a rude and boyſterous manner, <hi>What,</hi> George, <hi>doth the Spirit of God ſpeak in Trees?</hi> Whereupon <hi>G. K.</hi> ſaid (being greatly provoked by his interrupting of him, and Unchriſtian Behaviour and Diſcourſe) <hi>Thou Impudent Raſcal, who ſaith the Spirit of God ſpeaks in Trees, as it doth in Men?</hi> But to make the thing ſeem odious, the Publiſhers of this Publick Writing ſay, <hi>It was in a Publick Aſſembly;</hi> as if it had been in ſome Court, or as if he had been brought before this Magiſtrate, (as they call him) upon ſome Examination, and there, inſtead of behaving himſelf ſoberly, he preſently calls him <hi>Impudent Raſcal;</hi> this they would falſly inſinuate, as alſo, <hi>That before long he'll go into the Council-Room, and into the Courts, and there Revile the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellours and Magistrates, and call them impudent Raſcals.</hi> Oh, the horrid Impudency of thoſe Men! Let Shame cover their Faces, if they have any in them!</p>
            <p>And whereas they further ſay, <hi>That</hi> G. K. <hi>with ſeveral of his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents with an unuſual Inſolency having Traduced the Industry, Care and Vigilancy of ſome Magiſtrates here, in their late Proceedings againſt ſome Privateers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and hath thereby alſo defamed and arraigned the Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Provincial Judicatory,</hi> &amp;c. As if <hi>G. K.</hi> and ſeveral others had printed a Book, and defamed and arraigned them, and denyed their Power of Magiſtracy; whereas all that impartially read the ſaid printed Appeal, will find that <hi>G. K.</hi> did not defame nor arraign them, but they having given a Commiſſion, and hired Men to fight (which was diametrically oppoſite and contrary to the often declared and known Principle of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> againſt <hi>all uſe of the Carnal Sword)</hi> it was propoſed, amongſt other things, to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by all faithful Friends at the Yearly Meeting, whether theſe Men ought not to be condemned and diſowned as <hi>Quakers,</hi> but it was never intended to deny them to be Magiſtrates; for as Magiſtrates they were obliged to do what they did and it was commendable in them who did ſo commiſſionate and hire Men to fight, and alſo ſearch the Town for Arms, &amp;c. But the great Queſtion is, <hi>Whether they did not</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:43068:6"/>
               <hi>tranſgreſs as they profeſſed to be Miniſters and Quakers?</hi> If nay, but that the <hi>Care and Vigilancy of theſe Magiſtrates here at</hi> Philadelphia, <hi>called</hi> Quakers, <hi>is worthy of Commendation,</hi> as they intimate, <hi>for ſaving of a Sloop by Force of Arms,</hi> how much more ſhall their Care and Vigilancy be worthy of Commendation, to raiſe a Militia to ſave and defend the whole Country, if any occaſion ſhould offer? But how ſteadfaſt this doth manifeſt them to be the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principle of <hi>Refuſing in all caſes to fight, and that for Conſcience ſake,</hi> I ſhall leave all to judge. I always thought that which was a matter of Conſcience to the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Old England, Barbadoes,</hi> and other places, had been a matter of Conſcience to them under a Government of their own; but I find the contrary in theſe Magiſtrates and many others joyned with them here. But that which ſeems the moſt ſtrange to ſeveral obſerving Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in this place, is, that ſeveral called <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Maryland, Barbadoes,</hi> and other places, that pretend its a matter of Conſcience to them <hi>not to bear Arms,</hi> yet now will own theſe here in that Practice, unleſs they now think to leave that Article out of their Creed.</p>
            <p>In the next place, whereas <hi>Peter Boſs</hi> being offended with the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the 28. writ a Letter to <hi>Samuel Jenings,</hi> (being then in Church-Fellowſhip with him) ſhowing his Diſlike thereof, and telling <hi>S. J.</hi> of ſome of the Scandals he lay under; for this they iſſued forth a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant againſt him, and put him into Priſon, without ever dealing with him in a Church Method, and at the next Court preſented him for the ſame, to which Court he was bound to anſwer, where he gave his Attendance, with his Witneſſes ready, but not brought to Trial, although much deſired by him and his Wife, who urged the Injuries of the delay thereof.</p>
            <p>At the ſame Court <hi>William Bradford</hi> and <hi>John M“Comb</hi> appeared, and deſired they might come to a Trial, it being greatly to their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to be kept Priſoners; and ſaying, it is provided by <hi>Magna Charta, That Juſtice ſhall not be delayed to any,</hi> and we being <hi>free born Engliſh Subjects</hi> claim this as our Priviledge, and hope this Court will not deny it us, becauſe not only our Perſons are reſtrained, but <hi>William Bradford</hi>'s Working Tools are detained from him, with which he ſhould work to maintain his Family.</p>
            <p>Juſtice <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, <hi>What Bold, Impudent and Confident Fellows are theſe to ſtand thus confidently before the Court?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thou art very ignorant in the Law ſurely; does not thou know that there's a Law, that every Printer ſhall put his Name to the Book he prints, or the Preſs is forfeited.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>W. B.</speaker>
               <p>I know there was ſuch a Law, and I know when it expired.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. Cook.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>But it is revived again, and is in force, and without any regard to the matter of the Book, provides, That the Printer ſhall put his Name to all that he prints, which thou haſt not done.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>But waving from that, the Priſoners ſtill preſs'd for a Tryal. To which Juſtice <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, <hi>A Trial you ſhall have, and that to your Coſt too, it may be.</hi> And Juſtice <hi>Jenings</hi> ſaid, <hi>A Tryal you ſhall have, but for ſome Reaſon known to us, the Court defers it to the next Seſſions; and that is the Anſwer we give, and no other you ſhall have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this time <hi>John White</hi> Sheriff, pleaded vehemently againſt the Priſoners, greatly aggravating their (pretended) Crimes; and when complained of, that the Sheriff, (through whoſe hands goes all Fines and Forfeitures) ſhould be ſo bitter an Attorney againſt the Priſoners, he cloaked it under the Viſor of a <hi>Prothonitor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So this Court paſſed over, and the ſaid Perſons not brought to Tryal, but yet not wholly barren of Action, nor void of Injuſtice; for tho' they had not only got <hi>W. Bradford</hi> into Priſon, and taken his Letters from him, (with which he ſhould work) and his Paper and Books out of his Shop, but alſo they had got the Body of <hi>John M”Comb,</hi> with which one would think they might have been ſatisfied, had any thing of tenderneſs remained in them, the time they committed him being when his Wife was newly brought to Bed, and who lay very weak in a ſtrong Fever, and ſeveral thought ſhe would not live; and tho' he acquainted them of her Condition, and how deſtitute his Family was, requeſting them to let him go home, and he would promiſe to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at any time they ſhould call for him; This they would not grant, but to Priſon he was ſent; (tho' to give every one their due, <hi>White</hi> the Goaler was ſo kind as to let him go home an hour or two ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in an Evening after it was dark) yet our hot-ſpur'd Juſtices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſatisfied with having his Body, would do what in them lay, to ruin him and his Family; for whereas he kept an Ordinary, and for his Licenſe ſo to do had paid Governor <hi>Lloyd</hi> Twelve Pieces of Eight, which is <hi>Three Pound Twelve Shillings</hi> for the laſt twelve Months
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43068:7"/>
before, <hi>[No inconſiderable Price for a Licenſe]</hi> yet they now proceeded to ſuppreſs his keeping of an Ordinary, though he had fulfilled, and in no reſpect tranſgreſſed the Conditions of his Licenſe, as will appear by a Copy of the ſaid Licenſe, which here follows verbatim, <hi>viz.</hi>

               </sp>
               <p>But they would not allow of his Exception. Whereupon the Jury were atteſted. The form of the Atteſtation, as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>In the Preſence of Almighty God and this Court, you ſhall promiſe, well and truly to Try and true Deliverance make betwixt the Honourable</hi> William Penn, <hi>Proprietor and Governor of this Province, and the Priſoner at the Bar, according to Evidence.</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>After which, <hi>David Lloyd</hi> firſt, and <hi>John White</hi> next pleaded very hard againſt him, that that Letter did defame <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, confirming it, as they pretended, by reading ſome Paſſages out of ſome Law-books, and ſome Laws of this Province againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>To which the Attorneys of <hi>Peter Boſs</hi> pleaded, That he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the writing that Letter, but what was ſaid therein concerning <hi>S. Jenings,</hi> was not againſt him as he was a Magiſtrate, nor could it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43068:9"/>
be reckoned a Defamation, becauſe 'twas only a private Letter ſent to himſelf, ſhowing his diſlike in ſome things, and deſiring him to clear himſelf of other groſs and ſcandalous things that were reported of him, as is uſual for one Church member to do to another; and they brought a Caſe out of <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s <hi>Faithful Counſellor,</hi> that what is ſaid muſt be <hi>Falſo &amp; Malicioſe, i. e.</hi> falſly and maliciouſly, otherwiſe not actionable. And that if a Man ſpeak ſlightly of a Magiſtrate, if it be when he is not in the exerciſe of his Office, it is no defaming of him as a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, and ſo no treſpaſs againſt the Law alledged.</p>
               <p>To which <hi>David Lloyd</hi> replyed, <hi>That what was ſpoke againſt</hi> Samuel Jenings, <hi>muſt needs relate to him as a Magiſtrate, for take away</hi> Samuel Jenings, <hi>and where will the Magiſtrate be?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> ſaid, <hi>Take away</hi> Sam. Jenings <hi>the Magiſtrate, and where will</hi> Sam. Jenings <hi>the Quaker be?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> By this it ſeemeth to <hi>S. Jenings</hi> that it is as inherent in him to be a Magiſtrate as to be a <hi>Quaker,</hi> and therefore when his Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy ceaſeth, his <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> (according to him) muſt ceaſe, and like <hi>Hypocrates</hi> Twins live and die together; but yet he may remain to be <hi>Sam. Jenings,</hi> when he is neither Magiſtrate nor <hi>Quaker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when his Attornies were about further to open the matter, how he writ to him only as a Church-member, and offered to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome Preſidents in the Caſe, <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> interrupted, ſaying, <hi>They would not have matters of Religion diſcourſed there,</hi> ſaying, <hi>What muſt Religion be made a cover to revile and defame men, by ſaying, he did not write to him as a Magiſtrate, but as a Church-member?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which <hi>G. K.</hi> (as his Friend) deſired Liberty to ſpeak, as the Law in that caſe allows, but they were very unwilling to ſuffer him to ſay any thing in behalf of <hi>Peter Boſs, John White</hi> ſaying, <hi>G. K.</hi> was not <hi>Rectus in Curia;</hi> but through much and long importunity, he was permitted, who then told them, That a diſtinction muſt needs be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of words ſpoke to a Man as he is only in a private Capacity, and as he is a Magiſtrate; for when Magiſtrates, as <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> and <hi>Sam. Jenings,</hi> give us hard words, calling us <hi>Ranters, Apoſtates, Lyars, Wicked and Ungodly Men,</hi> &amp;c. ye will not ſay ye give us theſe Names as Magiſtrates; and then if ye can ſpeak to us, not as ye are Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, we may alſo ſpeak to you not as ye are Magiſtrates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas Harris</hi> his Attorney, and <hi>G. Keith</hi> his Friend, proffered to ſpeak further to ſeveral things that had been alledged by <hi>D. Lloyd</hi> and <hi>J. White,</hi> but were much menaced by <hi>Arthur Cook,</hi> and ſo was <hi>Peter Boſs</hi> himſelf, which was much reſented in the minds of many, that a man hath not liberty boldly to ſpeak in his own defence, nor his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torneys nor Friends for him, but often when they were pleading,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43068:9"/>
                  <hi>Commanded Silence upon pain of Impriſonment:</hi> Whereupon ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that it was hard that he had not liberty fairly to plead his own Cauſe. To which <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> ſaid, <hi>That as a</hi> Chriſtian <hi>he could bear any thing, but not as a Magiſtrate.</hi> Which was noticed by many how <hi>A. Cook</hi> ſet the Chriſtian and Magiſtrate in oppoſition the one to the other, as if we were not to expect that when they act as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates they are indued with Chriſtian Patience, Meekneſs and Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, as if when they act the <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> they put off the <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Note,</hi> That a little before <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> and <hi>David Lloyd</hi> would not allow of any diſtinction betwixt the Magiſtrate and <hi>Quaker,</hi> and yet now to ſerve his turn their Brother <hi>Cook</hi> grants it: Oh! the Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Deceit and Hypocriſie of theſe men!]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. Keith</hi> pleaded further, though with much difficulty, That <hi>Peter Boſs</hi> being a Member of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Church, they ought not to go to Law with him until they had proceeded orderly with him in their mens Meetings, and given him Goſpel Order; for the things of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt him and <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> relate wholly to Church Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and belong to a Spiritual Court, and not to this.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Da. Lloyd,</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is a ſpiritual Court; for in</hi> England <hi>they can try A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm in this Court.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
                  <p>But <hi>Peter Boſs</hi> is not accuſed of Atheiſm; and if a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs one Almighty God, this Court hath nothing to do with him for his Opinions or Perſwaſions in Religious matters.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then <hi>D. Lloyd</hi> read a paſſage out of a Law-book, <hi>That certain words ſpoke againſt a Biſhop or Miniſter, were actionable, tho' not actionable when ſpoke againſt a private perſon; which</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>is the preſent caſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Perſon ſtanding by, ſaid, <hi>May not ſin be reproved in a Biſhop or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate?</hi> At which they were greatly offended, and cauſed an Officer to take the ſaid Perſon, <hi>viz. Ralph Ward,</hi> out of the Court.</p>
               <p>But for the further ſatisfaction of the Jury, and all others preſent, that he did not defame <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> as a Magiſtrate, <hi>Peter Boſs</hi> greatly preſſed to have his ſaid Letter read, which after ſome time was done, tho' with great Impatience. The which Letter here follows, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <p>Samuel Jenings, <hi>I perceive thou art no Changeling, thou looks like a Man for Bulk and Talk, like a Chriſtian ſometimes; but really</hi> Samuel, <hi>whatever thy ſelf or others think of thee, I do hereby tell thee, and that under my Hand, That I have met with more truly Noble and Manlike Treatment, and the Exerciſe of better</hi> Chriſtianity <hi>among</hi> Turks, <hi>than hath appeared hitherto in thee towards me: Surely</hi> Samuel, <hi>hadst thou exerciſed but the common ſenſe and capacity of a rational man, thou couldſt not think that the Governour would ſend a man three thouſand Miles with Inſtruction to take care and charge of his Servants, Goods and Stock, ſhould be in a meaner Capacity than his Negroes, and not have a ſupply of Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c. but this thou haſt very irrationally and unmanly denyed unto me, and both thy ſelf and Wife have proved Falſe and Deceitful unto me: Thou requeſted me to write for thee, and promiſed Satisfaction for my Labour, and I wrote about</hi> 149 <hi>Laws of the Province, and a Copy of the King's Charter to the Governour, and a Liſt of the Governours Tenants in the County of</hi> Bucks, <hi>with the Quantity of Land they hold, and upon what Tenure; but like a deceitful Man thou refuſeſt to perform thy Promiſe: And know this, that beſide thy Promiſe, I have thy Letter under thy Hand to produce, as alſo the Evidence of one of the moſt credibleſt Perſons in the Town, whom thou toldſt, That I had wrote a Copy of the Laws for thee, and thou waſt to pay</hi>

                        <hi>me</hi> 18 s. <hi>for it. Nay, yet further,</hi> Samuel, <hi>when the Commiſſioners, which are thy Overſeers, (to whom thou art obliged to render an Account, ſo often as they require it of thee) had ordered thee to let me have</hi> 50 s. <hi>for a Supply of Neceſſaries, thou refuſed to let me have it, unleſs I would take it in thy Shop Goods, (which would have proved little better than a Cheat) for thou wouldst have charged</hi> 50 s. <hi>to the Governours Account, when, its like, I ſhould not have had really the value of</hi> 25 s. <hi>of thee. I once more conſulted the Commiſſioners, who very freely and willingly wrote to thee a few Lines, Signed with their own Hands, and gave it to me to deliver to thee, wherein they ordered thee to pay me</hi> 50 s. <hi>in Silver Money, according to their former Order; but thou return'd them this Anſwer by me,</hi> That thou wouldſt not anſwer their Bill, <hi>bidding me carry it back to them again; which indeed is no other than an unchristian and unmanly ſlighting of the Commiſſioners, and a baſe and ſordid Contempt of, and trampling on that Power which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour hath inveſted them with over thee and his Affairs; one might think by thy Deportment towards them, that thou doſt neither know thy ſelf, nor the Station in which thou art placed by the Governour; for</hi> Samuel, <hi>thou art no other than a mercenary Servant, and that during the Will and Pleaſure of the Governour, and the Commiſſioners are thy Overſeers and Controulers, to whom thou art obliged to render an Account,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Before I be demanded to plead to the Preſentment, I deſire to be heard a few words: which the Court granting, he ſaid, I would have you to conſider, that both ye and we are as a Beacon ſet on a Hill, and the Eye of God, Angels and Men are upon us; and if ye do any thing againſt us that is not fair and juſt, not only theſe parts hereaway will hear of it, but <hi>Europe</hi> alſo; for if we be wronged (if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) we think to make it known to the World.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Here ſome were very impatient, telling him, he menaced the Court, but he would do well to take heed what he did; for if he ſpoke or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43068:13"/>
publiſhed any thing in derogation of the Sentence of Court, it was againſt a Law in this Province, and he would be puniſhed for it.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
                  <p>An able Lawyer hath ſaid, When a Man is wronged and can have no other Remedy printing is the laſt: Ye muſt give Loſers leave to complain: Our Friends have done it formerly in <hi>Old England</hi> when they have been unjuſtly dealt by, and particularly <hi>William Penn</hi> and <hi>George Whitehead.</hi> I will not ſay any thing againſt your Law, but I ſuppoſe the true ſence of it is, that if any derogate from the Sentence of a Court, if the Sentence be juſt, he is puniſhable, but not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Are your Courts infallible? Is it not poſſible that at times they may give an unjuſt Sentence?</p>

                  <speaker>David Lloyd.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yea, our Courts are infallible in Law,</hi>

                  <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
                  <p>Then why do you admit of Appeals? If they be infallible, there is no occaſion to appeal to a higher Judicatory.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then <hi>David Lloyd</hi> went about to mend the matter, ſaying, <hi>They were infallible ſo far as the Law was infallible, and ſo far as they kept to the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> This is as if he had ſaid, they are infallible ſo far as they are Infallible, which is not very good Senſe, unleſs they mean, that they are not abſolutely Infallible, but conditionally; and if conditionally only, it is poſſible they may give a wrong Sentence and he who they give it againſt may complain, without juſt cauſe of Offence, otherwiſe their Court here is as arbitrary as any in the World.</p>

                  <p>I deſire you to hear me a little further, and that is, That I think it very unfair, that thoſe who are deeply prejudiced againſt me, and my oppoſite Parties and Accuſers, ſhould be my Judges, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Sam.

                     <hi>There is a Law of this Province, that no words of Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be ſpoken againſt a Magiſtrate; nor ſhall any ſpeak ſlightingly or abuſively of them, which thou haſt done.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
                  <p>They were not ſpoke to him as a Magiſtrate, nor when he was in the exerciſe of his Office; and to call him <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Imperious,</hi> doth not reflect on him as a Magiſtrate: If I had called him <hi>Ignorant</hi> in the Laws, and <hi>Unjuſt</hi> in the Execution of them, this would have reflected on him as a Magiſtrate, but not to call him <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;</hi> for <hi>Piety,</hi> whereof <hi>Humility</hi> is a Branch, is no eſſential Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Magiſtrate tho' it be of a Chriſtian and Miniſter of Chriſt; the only eſſential Qualifications of a Magiſtrate, are to be <hi>knowing the Laws,</hi> and <hi>juſt in the execution of them.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>[Note,</hi> That it is no Reflection on a Taylor, Shoe maker, or the like Trades-man, to be called Proud, for he may be a good Artificer, altho' he be proud: but to be proud reflecteth on him as he profeſſeth to be a Chriſtian or Miniſter of Chriſt. And this diſtinction. <hi>S. Jenings</hi> muſt needs allow, unleſs he will ſay, that when he exerciſeth his Magiſterial Office he is no Chriſtian, but wholly putteth off his Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of a Chriſtian, as a man putteth off one Garment and putteth on another. But if he will ſay he is ſtill a Chriſtian, as well as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43068:14"/>
then he ought to be humble, meek and forbearing, eſpecially to his Fellow Church-Members, not high and imperious, and exacting the ſeverity of the Law of them; for even the Law ſaith, <hi>Summum jus, Summa Injuria,</hi> i. e. <hi>The Rigour of the Law is high Injuſtice;</hi> for if the Law of <hi>England</hi> be <hi>Lex Miſercordiae,</hi> as it is called, then well may the Law of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> be called <hi>Lex Miſercordiae,</hi> i e. <hi>The Law of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> that is, forbearing, and exacteth not the utmoſt Farthing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note</hi> further, That one Reaſon of theſe words being mentioned in the <hi>Plea of the Innocent,</hi> viz. <hi>That</hi> S. Jenings <hi>had ſhown himſelf too high and imperious in worldly Courts,</hi> was, that a little time before he had commanded to bring one of his Fellow Members, <hi>(viz. Samuel Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley) Headlong to the Court,</hi> and fined him Ten Pound for refuſing to come at his Command, and ſent him to Priſon, to remain without Bail till paid. Now admit he did not illegally in this, or becoming a ſevere auſtere Magiſterial Officer, yet was it not unbecoming a tender <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who ſhould be <hi>meek</hi> and <hi>merciful?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>G. K.</hi> Having refuſed to plead otherwiſe then as above-mentioned, <hi>Dav. Lloyd</hi> bid the Clerk record him <hi>Nihil dicit, i. e.</hi> he ſaith nothing. To which <hi>G. K.</hi> replied, Why ſhould he Record me <hi>nihil dicit?</hi> I think I have ſaid a great deal. And after ſome further Diſcourſe <hi>G. K.</hi> was ſet aſide, and <hi>Thomas Budd</hi> ſet to the Bar. The moſt material Diſcourſe that paſſed here follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Preſentment being read, the Clerk ſaid, <hi>Thomas Budd, What ſay you? Are you Guilty, as you ſtand here preſented, or Not Guilty?</hi>
               </p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>T. Budd.</speaker>
                  <p>Not Guilty, as there preſented, but own my ſelf to be one of the Authors of that Book, called, <hi>The Plea of the Innocent.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clerk.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By whom will you be tried?</hi>

                  <speaker>T. Budd.</speaker>
                  <p>By God and the Country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>D. Lloyd,</hi> as Attorney againſt him, pleaded, <hi>That to call a man Proud and Ignorant, was to reflect on the Governour that constituted him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>G. Keith</hi> in behalf of <hi>Tho. Budd,</hi> anſwered, That what was there ſaid of <hi>Sam. Jenings,</hi> as to calling him <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>Preſumptuous,</hi> was not ſaid of him as he was a Magiſtrate, but as he profeſſed himſelf to be a Chriſtian and Miniſter of Chriſt; I penn'd thoſe words in the <hi>Plea of the Innocent,</hi> concerning <hi>S. Jenings,</hi> and know they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt him as a Magiſtrate, as the foregoing words in that Book do manifeſt; but that he is ignorant in Divinity, that Book gives an Inſtance, and we now here affirm, elſe he would never have ſaid, <hi>That to do Gods Buſineſs, we need God's Power; but to do our own Buſineſs, as men, we needed not a Supernatural Power,</hi> nor have joyned with them that ſay, <hi>The Light within is ſufficient to Salvation without any thing elſe,</hi> thereby excluding the Man Chriſt Jeſus from having any part in our
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43068:15"/>
Salvation. And our calling him <hi>Preſumptuous</hi> and <hi>Inſolent</hi> did relate to his ſevere preſſing me to an abſolute Submiſſion to their Judgment, in a matter of Conſcience, when as <hi>S. J.</hi> refuſed to ſubmit to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Friends, both here and at <hi>London,</hi> in worldly matters; alſo, his calling me <hi>Apoſtate and worſe than Prophane,</hi> in a Publick Meeting, as well as in private, and ſaying, <hi>We ſhall let thee know,</hi> George, <hi>that we ſhall judge thee:</hi> And his Signing that Paper of the 28. againſt me, wherein they ſo boldly aſſert, <hi>That they have tenderly and orderly dealt with me;</hi> when as they never dealt with me.</p>
                  <p>After ſome further pleading, the Jury were called, and <hi>Tho. Budd</hi> was asked, <hi>If he had any Exceptions to make againſt any of them?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tho. Budd.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I except againſt all of them that are called <hi>Quakers,</hi> becauſe I perceive they are them that are Parties againſt me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>D. Lloyd.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That is too general, and is no Exception in Law.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Tho. Budd.</speaker>
                  <p>I except particularly againſt <hi>Rich. Walter,</hi> becauſe he Signed the Paper of the 28. againſt us (which this Book was an Anſwer to) and againſt <hi>James Fox,</hi> becauſe he ſigned a Paper in the Quarterly againſt us; and I except againſt <hi>Joſeph Kirle</hi> and <hi>John Whitpane,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have ſpoke againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> and me, and juſtified theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments againſt us.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>But theſe Exceptions would not be allowed of, and therefore the above-named Jurors went forth, and next Morning brought in their Verdict, <hi>That</hi> Thomas Budd <hi>was guilty of ſaying,</hi> Samuel Jenings <hi>had behaved himſelf too high and imperiouſly in Worldly Courts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which <hi>Tho. Budd</hi> and <hi>Geo. Keith</hi> pleaded, That it was no Verdict, not being found to be a Breach of any Law, any more than the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of the Jury at <hi>Old Bayly,</hi> which was, <hi>That they found</hi> W. Penn <hi>guilty of ſpeaking in Grace Church-ſtreet,</hi> which the Court took to be a clearing of him. But this was nothing regarded by our Juſtices, for they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded and gave Judgment againſt <hi>Thomas Budd</hi> and <hi>George Keith,</hi> viz. <hi>That they ſhould each of them pay Five Pound a piece, as a Fine.</hi> And tho' in this caſe <hi>S. Jenings</hi> was the Perſon only concerned as the Adverſary Party, yet he ſat on the Bench when they gave Judgment againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> and <hi>T. B.</hi> which was judged moſt unreaſonable and illegal, that <hi>Sam. Jenings,</hi> (who is the Governour's Receiver of all Fines and Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) ſhould be ſo actively concerned in fining theſe Men, having ſo manifeſtly before ſhewed his Prejudice againſt them. Beſide, it being expreſly contrary to a Vote of an Aſſembly of this Province, the 3d Month, 1689. (where <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> was Speaker) <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved,</hi> Nemine contradicente, <hi>That it is an Agrievance that any Perſon who is commiſſionated or appointed by the Governour to receive the Governour's Fines, Forfeitures and Revenues whatſoever, ſhall ſit in Judgment</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:43068:15"/>
                  <hi>in any Court of Judicature within this Government, in any matter or cauſe whatſoever, where a fine or forfeiture ſhall or may accrue to the Governour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> could not wink at this Agrievance, and let <hi>Samuel Jenings</hi> ſit on the Bench when theſe Perſons were Fined.</p>
               <p>But for a further proof that <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> has ſhown himſelf too High and Imperious, obſerve what follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1ſt,</hi> That when <hi>G. K.</hi> was pleading in Court, and ſhowing how <hi>S. J.</hi> had behaved himſelf too high and imperious, he ſaid, <hi>If this be High and Imperious, I will be yet more High and Imperious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2dly,</hi> Upon the Jury's bringing in their Verdict againſt <hi>Tho. Aſhly, S. J.</hi> thus menaces him, <hi>viz. Thou told me formerly that I had done my worſt, but now thou art fallen into my hands, thou ſhalt know that I have not done my Worſt yet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3dly,</hi> He ſaid to another Perſon, <hi>Thou ſhalt have as little Juſtice as I can.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> He ſaid to <hi>John Skeen,</hi> who had been Governor, and was then Judge, <hi>Thou pitiful Whip-jack, I deſpiſe thee;</hi> and yet we find not that <hi>John Skeen</hi> had him preſented or proſecuted at Court for this more than ordinary abuſive and ſcurrilous Expreſſion, ſhort of common Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and yet this is he who now can ſay, He will bear no affront, thereby ſhowing how unlike he is to a true Chriſtian, and even to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as well Heathen as Chriſtian Magiſtrates, who have born with Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence great Affronts and Reflections from Perſons far inferior to them.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5thly,</hi> Another inſtance of <hi>S. J</hi>'s Pride and Inſolency is, that on the <hi>10th</hi> on the <hi>10th</hi> Month, coming out of Court, ſaid to <hi>Ralph Ward</hi> and <hi>John M”Comb,</hi> in the open Street, before many Witneſſes, <hi>If I draw forth my hand againſt you,</hi> (ſtretching forth his Arm and ſhaking it) <hi>I will not pull it in until I have quelled you all.</hi> This preſumptuous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſavoureth too much of <hi>Lucifer</hi>'s Pride, who ſaid <hi>I will be like the moſt High, I will exalt my Throne above the Stars of God,</hi> Iſa. 14. 13, 14. It is too high an Expreſſion, and too peremptory for any mortal Man to ſay, <hi>If I draw forth my hand, I will not pull it in until I have quelled you all.</hi> What is this in a manner, but to equal himſelf to God Almighty, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 40, 41. <hi>For I lift up my Hand to Heaven, and ſay, I live for ever, If I whet my glittering Sword, and mine Hand take hold on Judgment, I will render vengeance to mine Enemies,</hi> &amp;c. Oh! is it not above the Power of mortal Man, to ſay, <hi>If I draw out my Hand, I will not pull it in until I have quelled you all?</hi> Is not this to talk as if he were the Almighty? But know, O vain weak Man! thy Breath is in thy Noſtrils, and that Infinite Power that made thee, (if thou draw forth thy Hand againſt the Innocent, glorying in thy Power that is but ſmall) may cauſe thy Hand to Wither or turn Leprous, and lay thy Body and Power in the Duſt, and caſt both Soul and Body
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:43068:16"/>
into Hell-fire. And therefore repent of this thy abominable <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Inſolency</hi> before it be too late.</p>
               <p>And tho' <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> is now ſo zealous for the proſecuting them that ſay any thing againſt Magiſtrates, yet it's not long ago that he ſpoke much againſt <hi>Tho. Lloyd,</hi> Deputy Governour, and carried about (out of one County into another) a parcel of Lampooning Rhimes, made againſt <hi>T. L.</hi> call'd <hi>Taffy</hi>'s <hi>Fair,</hi> which he repeated over his Pots of Beer to make ſport for the Company.</p>
               <p>But to return, altho' the Jury brought in a ſpecial Verdict, which was only, <hi>That</hi> Thomas Budd <hi>was guilty of ſaying,</hi> Sam. Jenings <hi>had ſhown himſelf too high and imperious in Wordly Courts,</hi> which is no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of any particular Law, yet the Bench gave Judgment againſt them as tho' they had broke ſome Law, which was, <hi>That</hi> G. K. <hi>and</hi> T. B. <hi>ſhould pay</hi> 51. <hi>a piece.</hi> Whereupon they finding themſelves ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved by this Judgment, craved an Appeal to the Provincial Court in Law, which was denied them. Then by Advice of able Council, they requeſted an Appeal to the King and Queen, and their Council in <hi>England,</hi> the King having reſerved all Final Appeals to himſelf, in the Charter to <hi>W. P.</hi> But this alſo was denied them, (tho' <hi>Robert Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> declared his diſſent in this matter, as in ſeveral other their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings) ſo that the ſaid Perſons are left without all help or remedy, but muſt undergo the Arbitrary Sentence of this Court.</p>
               <p>And as a further Mark of the miſerable declenſion of theſe men, and of their cold zeal for the honour of God, take a view of two Laws which they now execute; the firſt is the <hi>5th</hi> Chapter of their Laws, where it is enacted, <hi>That whoſoever ſhall ſpeak looſely and prophanely of Almighty God, Jeſus Chriſt, the holy Scriptures or Spirit of Truth, ſhall for every ſuch Offence pay</hi> 5 s. The other place is <hi>Chap.</hi> 29. where it is enacted, <hi>That whoſoever ſhall ſpeak ſlightingly, or carry himſelf abuſively a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Magiſtrate, ſhall for every ſuch Offence ſuffer according to the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Magiſtrate, provided it be not leſs than</hi> 20 s. according to which Law they have Fined <hi>Peter Boſs</hi> Six Pound, and <hi>G. K.</hi> and <hi>T. B.</hi> each Five Pound, for ſpeaking ſlightingly of <hi>Sam. Jenings,</hi> as they pretend. Whereas if they had ſpoke Prophanely of <hi>Almighty God, Jeſus Christ,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of Truth,</hi> or <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> the Law inflicts but 5 <hi>s.</hi> Were not theſe Men far more zealous for their own Honour than the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, they would never let this diſproportion of Puniſhment for Offences againſt Almighty God and poor Mortal Man, ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record thus, to their Shame and Infamy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>10th</hi> of the <hi>10th</hi> Month, 1692. <hi>William Bradford</hi> was called into Court, and ſet to the Bar.</p>
               <p>The Preſentment read, the ſubſtance of which was, <hi>That they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the</hi> 9, 10, 11, <hi>&amp;</hi> 12. <hi>Articles of the Paper, call'd,</hi> An Appeal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:43068:16"/>
                  <hi>as being of a tendency to weaken the hands of the Magiſtrates. And we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> William Bradford <hi>for printing of the ſaid Seditious Paper,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Clerk,</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What ſay you,</hi> William Bradford, <hi>are you guilty as you ſtand preſented, or not guilty?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>W. Bradford,</speaker>
                  <p>In the firſt place, I deſire to know, whether I am clear of the <hi>Mittimus,</hi> which differs from the Preſentment.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>The Clerk and Attorney read and peruſed the <hi>Mittimus</hi> and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, and finding them to differ, ſaid, <hi>That when</hi> W. B. <hi>was cleared according to Law, he was cleared of the</hi> Mittimus.</p>
               <p>But <hi>W. B.</hi> inſiſted to know, Whether on the iſſue of the Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was clear of the <hi>Mittimus?</hi> And after a long debate thereon, anſwer was made, <hi>That</hi> W. B. <hi>was clear of the</hi> Mittimus <hi>on the Iſſue of the Preſentment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Next <hi>W. B.</hi> deſired to know what Law that Preſentment was grounded on.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>D. Lloyd,</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is grounded both on Statute and Common Law.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>W. B.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray let me ſee that Statute and Common Law, elſe how ſhall I make my Plea? Juſtice <hi>Cook</hi> told us laſt Court, <hi>That one reaſon why ye deferred our Trial then, was, that we might have time to prepare our ſelves to anſwer it;</hi> but ye never let me have a Copy of my Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor will ye now let me know what Law ye proſecute me upon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>D. Lloyd <hi>and</hi> J. White,</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It's not uſual to inſert in Indictments againſt what Statute the Offence is, when it's againſt ſeveral Statutes and Laws made, and if thou wilt not plead Guilty or not Guilty, thou wilt loſe thy Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of being Tried by thy Country.</hi> And they order'd the Clerk to write down that <hi>W. Bradford</hi> refuſed to plead; which he did; but as he was writing it down, <hi>W. B.</hi> deſired they would not take that advantage againſt him, for he refuſed not to plead, but only requeſted that which was greatly neceſſary, in order to his making his own Defence; and ſeveral in the Court requeſting on the Priſoners behalf, that the Court would not take advantage againſt him, they admitted him to plead, and he pleaded, <hi>Not Guilty.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then the Jury were called over, and atteſted, <hi>viz. Humphry Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terman, Joſeph Kirle, James Fox, Samuel Hoult, Thomas Wharton, Tho. Marle, Nicholas Rideout, John Whitpane, Richard Sutton, Richard Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Thomas Morris, Abraham Hardiman.</hi> But before they were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, they asked <hi>W. B.</hi> if he had any Exceptions to make againſt any of them that were returned for the Jury?</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>W. Bradford,</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I have, and particularly againſt two of them, (and which Exceptions I think are rational,) and that is againſt <hi>Joſ. Kirle</hi> and <hi>James Fox;</hi> for at the time when I was committed to Priſon <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> told me, That <hi>Joſeph Kirle</hi> had ſaid, <hi>That if the proceedings of the Magiſtrates was thus found fault with, that they muſt not defend</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:43068:17"/>
                     <hi>themſelves againſt Thieves and Robbers, Merchants would be diſcouraged of coming here with their Veſſels,</hi> &amp;c. And I except alſo againſt <hi>James Fox,</hi> becauſe on the firſt day after <hi>Babit</hi> and his Company were taken, I being at <hi>Sam. Carpenter</hi>'s, there was Governor <hi>Lloyd, James Fox,</hi> and ſeveral others, and in diſcourſe concerning taking of the ſaid Privateers, <hi>James Fox</hi> greatly blamed <hi>W. Walker,</hi> becauſe he found fault with ſome Juſtices that were <hi>Quakers,</hi> for commanding men, and as it were preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to go againſt the ſaid Privateers; and alſo <hi>James Fox</hi> joined with <hi>Tho. Lloyd</hi> in ſaying, <hi>He would mark them as Enemies to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and well-being of the Province, who were neutral in the caſe of going againſt</hi> Babit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which Inſtances I think it appears that theſe two Perſons have prejudg'd the Cauſe that is now to come before them; <hi>Joſeph Kirle</hi> acknowledged he had ſpoke ſuch words, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be diſcharged; but they would not allow of thoſe Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, altho' it is frequent in theſe Courts to change Jurors on barely ſaying they do except againſt ſuch a one.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Theſe are no Exceptions in Law; haſt thou at any time heard them ſay that thou printed that Paper? for that is only what they are to find.</hi>

                  <p>That is not only what they are to find, they are to find alſo, whether this be a Seditious Paper, or not, and whether it does not tend to the weakening of the Hands of the Magiſtrate.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>D. Lloyd,</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yea, that is matter of Law, which the Jury is not to meddle with, but find whether</hi> W. B. <hi>printed it or no, and the Bench is to judge whether it be a Seditious Paper, or not; for the Law has determined what is a Breach of the Peace, and the Penalty, which the Bench only is to give judgment on.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sam. Jenings,</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You are only to try whether</hi> W. B. <hi>printed it, or not.</hi>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>W. Bradford,</speaker>
                  <p>This is wrong; for the Jury are Judges in Law, as well as in matter of Fact. Which <hi>D. Lloyd</hi> again denied. Whereupon ſome of the Jury deſired to know what they were to be atteſted to try, for they did believe in their Conſciences, they were obliged to try and find whether that Paper was Seditious, as well as whether <hi>Will. Bradford</hi> Printed; and ſome of them deſired to be diſcharged.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>—A great Noiſe and Confuſion among the People.</p>
               <p>Some on the Bench ſhowing their willingneſs to allow of <hi>W. B</hi>'s Exceptions againſt the two Jurors, Juſtice <hi>Cook</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will not allow of it; is there four of us of a mind?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>D. Lloyd</hi> began to read the 9, 10, 11, and 12. Articles of the ſaid <hi>Appeal,</hi> and commented thereupon, denying, <hi>1st, That any man were hired to fight, but only to fetch back the Sloop; 2dly, That there was no Commiſſion given, but only a Hue-and-Cry or Warrant, as might be in any other ordinary caſe, and what was done was in caſe of great neceſſity, when a</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:43068:17"/>
                  <hi>Company of Rogues had Pyratically ſtolen away a Sloop to the great terror of the People of this place; and if the Magiſtrates muſt be blamed for their proceedings herein, what do you think will be the conſequence thereof, but to encourage all manner of wickedneſs? And</hi> Will. Bradford <hi>is preſented for printing and publiſhing this Seditious Paper, whereof you of the Jury are to find him guilty, if it appear to you that he has printed it.</hi>
               </p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>W. Bradford,</speaker>
                  <p>I deſire you of the Jury, and all here preſent, to take notice, that what is here contained in this Paper is not Seditious, but wholly relating to a Religious Difference, and aſſerting the <hi>Quakers</hi> Ancient Principles, and is not laid down poſitive, that they ought not to have proceeded againſt the Privateers, but laid down by way of Query, for the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> to conſider and reſolve at their Yearly Meeting, <hi>Whether it was not a Tranſgreſſion of the</hi> Quakers <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to hire and commiſſionate men to fight?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Juſtice</hi> Cook,</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If it was intended for the Yearly Meeting at</hi> Burlington, <hi>why was it publiſhed and ſpread abroad before the Meeting?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>W. B.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe it might be peruſed and conſidered of by Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Meeting, even as the Bills that are prepared to be paſſed into Laws, they are promulgated a certain number of days, before the Aſſembly meets, that all may have opportunity to conſider them.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then <hi>D. Lloyd</hi> read the Act againſt Printing, 14 <hi>Car</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. againſt Books being Printed without the Printers Name to them, and he ſaid, <hi>That was one Act which they proſecuted</hi> W. Bradford <hi>upon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which <hi>G. K.</hi> anſwer'd, and it may be obſerved, the ſingular and extraordinary Severity of theſe Juſtices, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who will pick out a Statute made in <hi>Old England,</hi> and proſecute a man upon it here, which might Ruin him and his Family, tho' it's not certain whether that Act be in force; when as moſt of <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s and the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books were printed without the Printers Name to them, when that Act was in force; and yet we never heard that any Printer in <hi>England</hi> was proſecuted for that; and therefore theſe here have exceeded them in <hi>England;</hi> which manifeſts their Malice and revengeful Spirit, that becauſe they cannot fix the matter to be any Breach of the Peace, (tho' they pretend it is) they'll proſecute the Printer for not putting his Name to what they ſuppoſe he Printed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That all the time theſe Perſons were upon Trial, the Grand Jury ſate by them, over-awing and threatning them when they ſpoke boldly in their own defence, and one of the Jury had Pen, Ink and Paper to write down ſuch words as they diſliked, ſignifying that they would preſent them, and Juſtice <hi>Cook</hi> other times bid them take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſuch and ſuch words, thereby over-awing the Priſoners that they had not liberty to plead freely. And when <hi>Tho. Harris,</hi> at the Requeſt of the Priſoner began to ſay ſomething to the matter, they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:43068:18"/>
ſtopt him, and bid an Officer take him away, and <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> ſaid, <hi>That he ſhould plead no more there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After a long time of pleading, <hi>D. Lloyd</hi> began to ſummons up the matter to the Jury, <hi>How that the printed Appeal was a Seditious Paper, and tended to weaken the Hands of the Magiſtrates, and encourage all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Wickedneſs; and that it was evident</hi> W. Bradford <hi>printed it, he being the Printer in this place, and the frame on which it was printed, was found in his Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>W. B.</speaker>
                  <p>I deſire the Jury, and all here preſent to take notice, that there ought to be two Evidences, to prove the matter of Fact, but not one Evidence has been brought in this caſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sam. Jening,</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Frame on which it was printed is Evidence enough.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>W. B.</speaker>
                  <p>But where is the Frame, there has no Frame been produced here; and if there had, it is no Evidence, unleſs ye ſaw me print on it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sam. Jenings,</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Jury ſhall have the Frame with them, it cannot well be brought here; and beſide the Seaſon is cold, and we are not to ſit here to endanger our Health; you are minded to put Tricks upon us.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>W. B.</speaker>
                  <p>You of the Jury, and all here preſent, I deſire you to take notice, that here has not one Evidence been brought to prove that I printed the Sheet, call'd, <hi>An Appeal.</hi> And whereas they ſay, the Frame is Evidence, which the Jury ſhall have; I ſay, the Jury ought not to hear or have any Evidence whatſoever, but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Judge and Priſoner.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Yet this was nothing minded, but <hi>Sam. Jenings</hi> ſummoned up to the Jury what they were to do, <hi>viz. To find,</hi> 1ſt, <hi>whether or not that Paper, call'd,</hi> The Appeal, <hi>had not a tendency to the weakening the hands of the Magiſtrates, and encouragement of Wickedneſs?</hi> 2dly, <hi>Whether it did not tend to the Diſturbance of the Peace? And,</hi> 3dly, <hi>Whether</hi> William Bradford <hi>did not print it, without putting his Name to it, as the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Jury had a Room provided them, and by that time they had been a quarter of an hour together, the Sheriff cauſed the Frame to be carried in to them, for an Evidence that <hi>W. B.</hi> printed the Appeal.</p>
               <p>The Jury continued about forty eight hours together, and could not agree, then they came into Court to ask a Queſtion, <hi>viz. Whether the Law did require two Evidences to find a man guilty?</hi> To anſwer which <hi>D. Lloyd</hi> read a paſſage out of a Law-Book, <hi>That they were to find it by Evidences, or on their own knowledge, or otherwiſe: Now</hi> (ſays <hi>D. Lloyd) this otherwiſe is the Frame which you have, which is Evidence ſufficient.</hi>
               </p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>W. Bradford,</speaker>
                  <p>The Frame which they have is no Evidence, for I have not ſeen it, and how do I or the Jury know that that which was carried in to them, is mine,—Interrupted—The Jury ſent forth again, and an Officer commanded to keep them without Meat, Drink, Fire or Tobacco.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:43068:18"/>
In the Afternoon the Jury came into Court again, and told, they were not like to agree. Whereupon the Court diſcharged them.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>W. Bradford</hi> told the Court, That ſeeing he had been ſo long detained Priſoner, and his Utenſils with which he ſhould work ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been ſo long detained, he hoped now to have his Utenſils re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and to be diſcharged from his Impriſonment.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>S. Jenings.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No, thou ſhalt not have thy things again, nor be diſcharged, but</hi> I <hi>now let thee know, thou ſtandeſt in the ſame Capacity to anſwer next Court, as before.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <p>Next Court being come, <hi>Will. Bradford</hi> attended, and deſired to know whether he ſhould have his Utenſils, and be diſcharged. <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> anſwered, <hi>Thou ſhalt not have thy Goods until releaſed by Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>W. Bradford.</speaker>
                  <p>The Law will not releaſe them, unleſs executed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Arthur Cook.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If thou wilt requeſt a Tryal, thou mayſt have it.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <p>Whereupon I query, <hi>1ſt.</hi> Whether it be practicable, or according to Law, to ſeiſe Men's Goods and impriſon their Perſons, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them under the Terror of a Goal, one ſix Months after another, and not bring them to Trial, unleſs requeſted by the Impriſoned?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> When a Jury is Sworn, <hi>Well and truly to Try, and true Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance make between the Proprietor and Priſoner,</hi> whether it be not very illegal to abſolve them from their Oath, diſmiſs them, and put it to another Jury to try?</p>
               <p>Now it may be obſerved, that nine of theſe Jurors were Perſons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced againſt <hi>G. K.</hi> and the reſt, and the other three happened to be moderate Perſons that were not called <hi>Quakers;</hi> and the reaſon they could not agree, was (as ſome of the ſaid Jurors, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have told) that theſe three Perſons ſtood upon the Nicety (as they call'd it) of Evidence that <hi>W. B.</hi> printed that Paper; whereas the other Jurors, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſaid, they believed that <hi>W. B.</hi> printed it, and that it was a ſeditious Paper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they would not acquit him.</p>
               <p>Does not this ſhow the great Declenſion of theſe People from their ancient Principle againſt the uſe of Carnal Weapons, that for only propoſing it to be enquired into, Whether it be not a Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principle, for any of that People to hire and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionate men to fight, that they will caſt men into Goal, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them as Seditious Perſons for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>Here follows a Breviate of a Paper that was preſented to the Court, to ſhow, that it was agreeable to the <hi>Quakers</hi> ancient Teſtimony, not to fight, which they took little or no notice of.</p>

               <p>ALL Bloody Principles and Practices, we, as to our own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, do utterly deny, with all outward Wars and Strife, and Fightings with outward Weapons, for any end <hi>(mark)</hi> or under any pretence whatſoever. And this is our Teſtimony to the whole World.—And we do certainly know, and ſo teſtifie to the World, that the Spirit of Chriſt, which leads us into all Truth, will never move us to fight and war againſt any man with outward Weapons, either for the Kingdom of Chriſt, nor for the Kingdoms of this World.—We have uſed no Force nor Violence againſt any man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when we have been wronged, we have not ſought to revenge our ſelves.—So that if we ſuffer as ſuſpected to take up Arms, or make War againſt any, its without any ground from us; for it neither is, nor ever was in our Hearts ſince we owned the Truth of God, neither ſhall we ever do it, becauſe it is contrary to the Spirit of Chriſt, his Doctrine, and the Practice of the Apoſtles.
