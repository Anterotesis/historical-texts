            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
RIGHT HONOURABLE
ANNE,
LADY WHARTON.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IT was,</hi> Madam, <hi>the</hi> Character
<hi>an</hi> ancient Worthy <hi>in the</hi>
Christian Church <hi>gave of a noble
person</hi> of your Sex, <hi>that, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to the matters of Religion she
was not only a</hi> Learner, <hi>but a</hi>
Judge. <hi>And, accordingly, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
to her divers of his writings
(even such as did require a very
<pb facs="tcp:56188:3"/>
accurate</hi> judgment <hi>in the reading
of them;) Which remain, unto this
day,</hi> dispersedly, <hi>in several parts
of his works, dignify'd with her
(often prefixed) name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> greater, <hi>indeed,</hi> than he, <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
it</hi> as an ill character, <hi>to be not
a</hi> doer <hi>of the Law, but a</hi> Judge. <hi>It
makes a great difference</hi> in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of the same faculty, <hi>and in
doing the</hi> same thing, <hi>with what</hi>
mind <hi>and</hi> design <hi>it is done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is a</hi> judging, that we may
learn, <hi>and a</hi> judging, that we may
not. <hi>A judgment</hi> subservient to
our duty, <hi>and a judgment</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to it. <hi>Without a degree of the</hi>
former <hi>no one can ever be a serious
Christian. By means of the</hi> latter,
<pb facs="tcp:56188:3"/>
               <hi>many never are. The</hi> World
through wisdom knew not God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A</hi> cavilling litigious wit, <hi>in the
confidence wherof any set themselves
above their</hi> Rule, <hi>and make it their
busines only to</hi> censure <hi>it, as if they
would rather find faults in</hi> it, <hi>than</hi>
themselves, <hi>is as</hi> inconsistent with
sincere piety, <hi>as</hi> an humbly judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
discerning mind <hi>is</hi> necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>proceeds from a due savour
and relish of divine things,</hi> peculiar
<hi>to them, in whom</hi> an heavenly spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<hi>and</hi> principle <hi>have the</hi> posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>and a governing power.</hi> They
that are after the Spirit, do sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the things of the Spirit.
<hi>The</hi> other <hi>from the</hi> prepossession
<pb facs="tcp:56188:4"/>
               <hi>and</hi> prejudice <hi>of</hi> a disaffected car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
mind. <hi>They</hi> that are after the
flesh, do only savour the things
of the flesh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ability God hath endow'd
your Ladiship with to judge of the</hi>
Truth that is after godliness, <hi>is</hi>
that <hi>you are better pleas'd to</hi> use,
<hi>than</hi> hear of. <hi>I shall therefore be
silent herein, and rather displease
many of them that know you, who
will be apt to think a</hi> copious sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<hi>is neglected, than say any thing
that may offend either against</hi> your
Ladiships <hi>inclination or</hi> my own.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here is nothing</hi> abstruse <hi>and</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
<hi>for you to exercise a</hi> profound
judgment <hi>upon; nor any thing</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<hi>to gratifie a</hi> pleasant wit. <hi>But
<pb facs="tcp:56188:4"/>
plain things, suitable to you,</hi> upon
accounts common to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Christians, <hi>not that</hi> are
peculiar to your self. 'Tis easie
<hi>to a well-temper'd mind, (of how
high intellectual excellencies soever)
to descend to the same level</hi> with the
rest; <hi>when for them to reach up to
the</hi> others pitch, <hi>is</hi> not so much
as possible.</p>
            <p>Our heavenly Father <hi>keeps not
(as to the substantials of our nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
distinct tables for</hi> his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<hi>but all must</hi> eat the same
spiritual meat, and drink the same
spiritual drink. <hi>He hath not</hi> one
Gospel <hi>for</hi> great wits, <hi>and</hi> another
<hi>for</hi> plainer people; <hi>But as all</hi> that
are born of him <hi>must meet at
<pb facs="tcp:56188:5"/>
length in</hi> one end, <hi>so they must all
walk by the</hi> same rule, <hi>and in the</hi>
same way, <hi>thither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And when I had first mentioned</hi>
this Text of Scripture <hi>in your
hearing,</hi> the savour <hi>you exprest to
me</hi> of the subject, <hi>easily induc'd
me, when, afterwards, I reckon'd a
discourse upon it might be of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
use, to address</hi> that also <hi>(such
as it is) in this way, to your Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
Accounting the mention of</hi>
your name <hi>might draw the eyes of
some to it, that have no reason to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi>
the Authors, <hi>and that, by this
means, if it be capable of proving
beneficial to any, the benefit might
be diffus'd so much the further.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The aptnes of the <hi>materials</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:56188:5"/>
               <hi>subject,</hi> here discourst of, to do good
generally, I cannot doubt. Neither
our present duty or peace; nor our
future safety or felicity can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for as they ought, till our
minds be more abstracted from
<hi>time,</hi> and taken up about the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen,
eternal World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While our thoughts are too ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
engaged about the <hi>events of
future time,</hi> they are <hi>vain, bitter,
impure,</hi> and <hi>diverted</hi> from our <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler,</hi>
and most <hi>necessary</hi> pursuits.
They follow much the temper and
bent of our Spirits, which are often
too intent upon what is <hi>uncertain,</hi>
and perhaps, <hi>impossible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All good and holy Persons can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
live in <hi>good Times.</hi> For who
<pb facs="tcp:56188:6"/>
should bear up the Name of God in
<hi>bad,</hi> and transmit it to <hi>succeeding
times? Especially</hi> when good Men
are not of the same mind, it is <hi>impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</hi>
And, <hi>more especially,</hi> when
they have not learn't, as yet, to bear
one anothers differences. The <hi>same
time,</hi> and <hi>state of things</hi> which
please some, must displease others.</p>
            <p>For <hi>some,</hi> that will think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
much injur'd if they be not
thought very pious Persons, will be
pleased with nothing less, than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of them that differ from
them. So that while this is designed
and attempted only; generally, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sort is pleased, The <hi>One</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is <hi>not done,</hi> The <hi>Other</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is <hi>in doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:56188:6"/>
It must be a marvellous <hi>alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Mens minds</hi> that must make
the Times please us all; while, upon
supposition of <hi>their remaining unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd,</hi>
There is nothing will please
<hi>one sort,</hi> but to see the <hi>other Pagans,</hi>
or <hi>Beggars,</hi> who in the mean time
are not enough mortify'd either to
<hi>their Religion,</hi> or the <hi>necessary
accommodations of humane life,</hi>
as to be well pleas'd with either.</p>
            <p>To trust God chearfully with the
Government of <hi>this World,</hi> and to
live in the joyful hope and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>a better,</hi> are the only means
to relieve and ease us; and give
us <hi>a vacancy</hi> for the proper work
and busines of <hi>our present Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the design of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:56188:7"/>
discourses. <hi>The former</hi> whereof
is directed against the <hi>careful
thoughts,</hi> which are apt to arise in
our minds concerning the <hi>Events
of future Time,</hi> upon <hi>a fear what
they may be. The other,</hi> which
by way of <hi>Appendix</hi> is added to
the former, tends to repress the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
desire of knowing what
they shall be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Which latter</hi> I thought, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of it's affinity to the other, <hi>fit</hi> to
be added to it; and in respect of
the <hi>commonness,</hi> and <hi>ill tendency</hi>
of this Distemper, <hi>very necessary.</hi>
And indeed both the <hi>extreams</hi> in
this matter are very <hi>unchristian,</hi>
and <hi>pernicious.</hi> A <hi>stupid neglect</hi>
of the <hi>Christian Interest,</hi> and of
<pb facs="tcp:56188:7"/>
               <hi>Gods Providence</hi> about it <hi>on the
one hand;</hi> And <hi>an Enthusiastick
Phrensie,</hi> carrying Men to expect
they well know not what? Or why?
<hi>on the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our great care should be to serve
<hi>that Interest</hi> faithfully <hi>in our own
stations,</hi> for our little time, that will
soon be over. Your Ladiship hath
been called to serve it <hi>in a Family</hi>
wherein it hath long flourished. And
which it hath <hi>dignify'd,</hi> beyond all
the splendour that <hi>Antiquity</hi> and
<hi>Secular greatnes</hi> could confer upon
it. The Lord grant it may long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to flourish <hi>there,</hi> under the <hi>joint-influence</hi>
of your <hi>noble Consort,</hi>
and your own; And, afterwards,
in a <hi>Posterity,</hi> that may imitate
<pb facs="tcp:56188:8"/>
their <hi>Ancestors in</hi> substantial Piety,
<hi>and solid goodness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is <hi>a glory</hi> that will not
fade, nor vary; not change <hi>with
times,</hi> but <hi>equally</hi> recommend it
self, to sober and good Men <hi>in all
times.</hi> Whereas <hi>that</hi> which arises
from the <hi>esteem of a Party</hi> can
neither be <hi>diffusive,</hi> nor <hi>lasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true that I cannot but rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
it <hi>a part</hi> of any ones <hi>praise</hi>
in a time wherein there are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent

words, for the same purpose for
which they are here subjoyn'd by

the Import of the Precept, Two
things in it require Explication.</p>

[The Morrow.]</item>
               <item>What is meant by the
[Thoughtfulnes] we
are to abstain from in
reference thereto.</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. By <hi>the Morrow</hi> must be meant
<list>
                  <item>1. Some measure of time or other.</item>
                  <item>2. Such Occurrences, as it may

            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:56188:10"/>
We are therefore to consider,</p>
            <p>1. What <hi>portion or measure of
time</hi> may be here signified by <hi>to
morrow,</hi> for some <hi>time</hi> it must sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie,
in the <hi>first place,</hi> as funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to the further meaning.
Not <hi>abstractly,</hi> or for <hi>it self,</hi> but
as it is the Continent of such or
such things as may fall within
that time. And so that measure
of time may, 1. Admit, no doubt,
to be taken <hi>strictly</hi> for the very
<hi>next day,</hi> according to the literal
import of the word <hi>to morrow.</hi>
But 2. It is also to be taken in a
much larger sence, for the whole
of our remaining time, <hi>all our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity</hi>
in this world. Indeed, the
whole time of our Life on Earth
is spoken of in the Scriptures, <hi>but
as a day. Let him alone that he may
accomplish as an hireling his day.</hi> Job
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56188:11"/>
14. 6. We are a sort of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
short-liv'd Creatures, <hi>we live but a
day,</hi> take the whole of our time
together. Much less strange is it
that the <hi>little residue,</hi> the <hi>future
time</hi> that is before us, which we
do not know how little it may
be, should be spoken of but as a
day. Experience hath taught even
sensual Epicures so to account their
remaining time: <hi>Let us eat and
drink, for to morrow we shall dye.
i. e.</hi> Very shortly. They were
right in their Computation, but very
wrong in their Inference. It should
have been, Let us watch and pray
to day, we are to dye to morrow,
let us labour for <hi>Eternity</hi> because
time is so short. But say they,
<hi>Let us eat and drink to day, for to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
we shall dye.</hi> A day to eat and
drink was, it seems, a great gain.
And if the phrase were not so used,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56188:11"/>
to signifie all the residue of our
future time, yet by consequence
it must be so understood. For if
we take to morrow in the strictest
sence <hi>for the very next day;</hi> they
that are not permitted, <hi>with solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,</hi>
to look forward so far as
the very next day; much less may
they to a remoter and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
time. Yea and we may in
some sense extend it not only to
<hi>all our future time,</hi> but simply to <hi>all
future time</hi> as that measures the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
and affairs, not of this
world only, but, which is more
considerable, even of that lesser se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
community, <hi>the Kingdom of
God</hi> in it, mentioned in the foregoing
Verse. Which Kingdom, besides
its future eternal State, lies also
spread and stretcht throughout all
time unto the end of the World.
And <hi>as to its present and temporal
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56188:12"/>
State,</hi> or <hi>as it falls under the measure
of time,</hi> it is not unsupposable that
it may be within the compass of
our Saviours design, to forbid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his disciples (who were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to pursue <hi>the blessedness</hi> of that
Kingdom <hi>in the other world,</hi> but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<hi>the service</hi> of it <hi>in this</hi>) an <hi>intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
and <hi>vexatious</hi> solicitude about the
success of their endeavours, for the
promoting its present Interest. <hi>i. e.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had more directly forbidden
their undue carefulness about their
own little concernments, what they
should eat, drink or put on; And
directed them <hi>rather</hi> and <hi>more prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally</hi>
to seek the Kingdom of
God and his Righteousnes, with
an assurance that those other things
should be added to them. It
seems not improbable he might in
conclusion, give this general di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
as with a more especial
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56188:12"/>
reference to the private concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of humane life, about which
common frailty might make them
more apt to be unduly thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
So with <hi>Some</hi> oblique and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
reference to the affairs of
that Kingdom too, which they were
<hi>here</hi> to <hi>serve</hi> as well as <hi>hereafter</hi> to
<hi>partake</hi> and <hi>enjoy.</hi> And about the
success of which service (being
once ingaged in it, and the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
they were to encounter, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
great and discouraging to
so inconsiderable persons as they
must reckon themselves) they might
be somewhat <hi>over solicitous</hi> also.</p>
            <p>Nor though they might not as
yet understand their own work,
nor (consequently) have the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of its difficulties as yet in
view, are we to think our Saviour
intended to limit the usefulness of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56188:13"/>
the instructions he now gave them,
to the present time, but meant
them to be of future use to them
as occasions should afterwards
occur. As we also find that they
did recollect some other sayings
of his, and understand better the
meaning of them, when particular
occasions brought them to mind,
and discovered how apposite and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable
they then were. <hi>Luke</hi>
24. 8. <hi>John</hi> 2. 22.</p>
            <p>So that we may fitly understand
this prohibition to intend, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally,
a repressing of that too great
aptitude and proneness in the minds
of men, unto undue excursions into
futurity, their intemperate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
rangings and roamings
into that unknown Country, that
<hi>Terra incognita,</hi> in which we can
but bewilder and lose our selves
to no purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:56188:13"/>
Therefore Secondly and more
principally, by [to morrow] we
are to understand <hi>the things</hi> that may
fall within that compass of <hi>future time.</hi>
For <hi>time</hi> can only be the object of
our care, <hi>in that relative sense,</hi> as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
unto such and such occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and emergencies that may fall
into it. And so our Saviour ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
himself in the very next
words, that by <hi>to morrow</hi> he means
<hi>the things of to morrow.</hi> To mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
shall take care <hi>for the things of
it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet here we must careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
distinguish, as to those <hi>things</hi> of
to morrow, matters of <hi>Event</hi> and
of <hi>Duty.</hi> We are not to think
these the equally prohibited objects
of our thoughts and care. <hi>Duty</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to us, it falls within our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56188:14"/>
and there are (no doubt)
thoughts to be employed, how I
may continue on in a course of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
unto which I am, by all the
most sacred Obligations tyed for a
stated course, that may lie before
me, let it be never so long, and
be there never so many to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
in it. There ought to be
thoughts used, of this sort, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the duties of the morrow, and
of all my future time. If it please
God to give me such additional
time I will love him to morrow,
I will serve him to morrow, I will
trust him to morrow, I will walk
with him to morrow. I will,
through the Grace of God, live in
his fear, service and communion,
even as long as I have a day to
live. Upon such terms doth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sincere Christian bind himself to
God, even <hi>for alwaies,</hi> as God binds
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56188:14"/>
himself to them on the same terms.
<hi>This God shall be our God for ever and
ever, he shall be our guide even unto
death.</hi> Psalm 48. 14. The case can
never alter with us in this regard,
but as the worthiest object of all
our thoughts is <hi>yesterday, and to day
the same, and for ever,</hi> so should the
course of our thoughts be too, in
reference to that blessed object. <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day will I bless thee, and praise thy
name for ever and ever.</hi> Psal. 145. 2.
<hi>I will sing unto the Lord as long as
I live; I will sing praise to my God
while I have my being.</hi> Psal. 104. 33.
The thoughts of our hearts should
be much exercised this way, how
it may be thus with us, in all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
time; that <hi>to morrow,</hi> in this
respect <hi>may be as this day, and much
more abundant,</hi> as is spoken on a
much another account, <hi>Isai.</hi> 56. 12.
To morrow shall be as this day, God
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56188:15"/>
assisting, and much more abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
as to my love to him, serving
of him, conversing with him, doing
and designing for him, which are
to run through all my dayes.</p>
            <p>But now for the Events of <hi>to
morrow,</hi> they are things quite of
another consideration. They do
not belong to us, they are not of
the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, none of the things
within our compass. To employ
our selves with excessive intention
of thoughts and cares concerning
them, is to meddle without our
Sphaere, beyond what we have
any warrant for, farther than as it
is in some cases supposable there may
be some connexion, and dependance,
between such and such Events, and
my own either sin, or duty,</p>
            <p>Now Events that may occur to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56188:15"/>
us to morrow, or in our future
time, you know are distingishable
into <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> grateful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful,
pleasing to us or displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
Good or grateful Events,
you easily apprehend, are not here
intended. We do not use to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex
our selves about good things,
otherwise than <hi>as they may be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
and as we may be deprived
of them, which privation or want
is an Evil. And under that noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our Saviour considers the object
of the prohibited thoughtfulness,
as his after words shew. Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for the day is <hi>the Evil of it.</hi>
And therefore gives caution not
equally against all fore-thoughts,
about the Events of future time;
of which some may be both rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal,
and pleasant. But against
forebodings, and presages of evil and
direful things. As lest such thoughts
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56188:16"/>
should slide into our minds, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
and obtrude themseves upon
us. <q>Alas! what shall I do to
live to morrow? I am afraid I
shall want bread for to morrow,
or for my future time.</q> This
our Saviour sayes is <hi>paganish, after
these things do the Gentiles seek,</hi> that
(as is intimated) have no father
to take care of them. <hi>Your heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
father knows you have need of these
things,</hi> vers. 32. And directs his
disciples to a noble object of their
thoughts and care, vers. 33. <hi>Seek
you first the Kingdom of God:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
as their future reward, so their
present work and business was to
lie. And then addes, <hi>Take no thought
for to morrow,</hi> q. d. It would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
an ill thing if you should want
bread to morrow, and it would
be worse if the affairs of Gods
Kingdom should miscarry, or you
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56188:16"/>
be excluded it. But mind you
your own present work, and be
not unduly concerned about these
surmised bad events, God will
provide. This is then, in short,
the <hi>object</hi> of this prohibited thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
[<hi>future time including what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
ungrateful events, we suppose,
and preapprehend in it.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Secondly, We are to enquire
about the <hi>thoughtfulness</hi> prohibited
in reference hereto. It cannot be
that <hi>all use of thoughts about future
events,</hi> even such, as, when they
occur, may prove afflictive, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be forbidden. Which
indeed may be collected from the
import of the word in the Text
that signifies <hi>another, peculiar sort of
thinking,</hi> as we shall hereafter have
more occasion to take notice. We
were made and are naturally,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56188:17"/>
               <hi>thinking Creatures;</hi> yea and <hi>forethink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
or capable of prospiciency and
foresight. 'Tis that by which in
part Man is distinguisht from Beast.
Without disputing as some do how
far <hi>nature,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Maimonid. Mor. Nev. D. Mer.Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saubon. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus.</note> in this, or that man,
doth contribute to divination and
prophecy; we may say of <hi>Man</hi>
indefinitely, <hi>he is a sort of divining
creature,</hi> and of <hi>humane nature</hi> in
common, that it much excells the
<hi>brutal,</hi> in this, that, whereas <hi>sense</hi> is
limited to the <hi>present; Reason</hi> hath
dignify'd our nature by adding to
it a <hi>sagacity,</hi> and enabling us to
use prospection in reference to what
yet lies more remotely before us.
And though we are too apt to a faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
excess herein, and to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presaging
(which it is the design
of this discourse to shew) yet we
are not to think that all use of
any natural faculty can be a fault;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56188:17"/>
for that would be to charge a
fault on the Authour of nature.
The faculties will be active. To
plant them therefore in our natures,
and forbid their use, were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with the wisdom, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and goodness by which
they are implanted. It must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be our business to shew
What Thoughtfulness is not, And then, what is
within
the compass of this Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>What is not.</hi> There is, in the
general, a <hi>prudent,</hi> and there is a
<hi>Christian</hi> use of forethought, about
matters of that nature already spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd;
which we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it was our Saviours meaning
to forbid.</p>
