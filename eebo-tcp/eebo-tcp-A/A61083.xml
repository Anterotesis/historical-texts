            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Quaere:</head>
            <head type="sub">Whether it be fit, according to the Principles of true Religion, and State,
to ſettle any Church-Government over the Kingdom haſtily, or
not; and with the Power commonly deſired, in the hands of the
Miniſters,</head>
            <p>1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>Rules</hi> laid down in the Word for practicall Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
are theſe in part; <hi>Let every one be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
in his own mind,</hi> Rom. 14. 5. ver. 23. and <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is not of faith, is ſin.</hi> Now the ſetling of any
Government upon a people who are yet generally
untaught in the nature and grounds of it, is to put
upon the people the practice of that wherein it is
impoſſible they can be fully perſwaded in their minds, and ſo either on a
neceſſity of ſin or miſery.</p>
            <p>2, There is great danger of bringing people under a Popiſh implicite
Obedience, by forcing on a practice of that which they ſcarce know, or
know but in part: And this is againſt the <hi>Nationall Covenant,</hi> to ſide with
any Principles of <hi>Popery:</hi> And we know it by experience, that the people
have been ever devoted to any thing the State ſets up; all the diſputes or
conſcience of the common people uſually ending in this, Whether it be
eſtabliſhed by Law or no; and going uſually no higher nor further then a
<hi>Statute</hi> or <hi>Act of State</hi> for their Religion.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Chriſt Ieſus</hi> himſelfe could as eaſily have ſetled his <hi>Goſpell-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
by <hi>miracle,</hi> as any can now by a <hi>Civill power,</hi> if there had been ſuch a
<hi>primary</hi> or <hi>moral</hi> neceſſity of eſtabliſhing it ſo ſoon upon a people ſcarce
enlightned for any part of it: But we ſee the contrary, firſt in himſelfe, he
taught long, and <hi>Iohn</hi> before him, and ſo the <hi>Diſciples;</hi> and the <hi>g<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> for
Government were not given till he aſcended, and the <hi>Modell</hi> for Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not brought forth but by degrees, and as people fell in and were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of the <hi>Yoake,</hi> and would <hi>mould</hi> more eaſily to the <hi>Commandements of
Chriſts;</hi> and whether then or no, is yet a Queſtion which ſome who have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102005:3"/>
ſit out the debates too,<note place="margin">See in M. <hi>Colemans</hi> Sermon.</note> though not with me, who am fully aſſured of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of order which the Apoſtle rejoyced to behold; though a power with
as little <hi>dominion</hi> in Government as <hi>tradition</hi> in Worſhip.</p>
            <p>4. We never read in the new Teſtament of a Goſpell-government
ſetled upon any that were not brought firſt under Goſpell-obedience by
the power of the Word and Spirit, which thouſands of Congregations in
this Kingdom are not: For as in <hi>materiall</hi> Buildings Stone and Timber
are not to be <hi>clapt</hi> together without <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>g</hi> and <hi>ſquaring,</hi> ſo nor in the <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall:</hi>
And whereas in the <hi>Temple</hi> there ſhould neither be <hi>Axe</hi> nor <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
heard, becauſe things were fitted before hand, and ſo laid together: I
queſtion how this could be in our Congregations now: I beleeve there
would be now more of the <hi>Axe</hi> and the <hi>Hammer</hi> heard, then of the
<hi>building</hi> ſeen.</p>
            <p>5. We have found by experience, that the ſpeedy ſetling of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon the Nation, hath made Reformation take little root, ſave in the
out ward man, or formall Obedience; and the reaſon was, Becauſe they
received not Reformation firſt in the power of the Word, but of the State,
which went not ſo deep into their Conſciences, but they could part with
it at any time upon a Law: Oh then, <hi>Why do not daies ſpeake, and multitude
of yeares teach knowledge?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. It is againſt the nature of <hi>Chriſts deſcription</hi> of himſelfe, and againſt
that ſutableneſſe which he preſſes for, amongſt all ſuch as ſhould ſubmit to
his <hi>Commandements; He ſhall not ſtrive, nor cry, neither ſhall any man heare
his voyce in the ſtreets,</hi> Matth. 11. 19. <hi>My yoke is eaſie, and my burden light,</hi>
Matth. 11. 29. <hi>His Commandements are not grievous,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 3. <hi>Neither do
men put new wine into old bottles.</hi> All which cannot be fulfilled in the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall
Congregations.</p>
            <p>7. The more time for <hi>trying</hi> the <hi>ſpirits,</hi> and <hi>proving all things,</hi> there is
leſſe danger to that <hi>State</hi> of errings in things received and authorized, and
of involving it ſelfe into the deſignes of Eccleſiaſticall power, then which
nothing hath ſooner broken the Civill power, as may be ſeen in Popiſh
Kingdoms, and our late Prelaticall. There can be no great danger in the
not ſudden incorporating the two powers: Since <hi>Moſes</hi> is not alive to
bring down the juſt <hi>Paterne of the Tabernacle,</hi> there may a new Star ariſe,
which was not ſeen at firſt; which, if we ſhut up our ſelves too ſoone
while the <hi>ſmoake</hi> is the <hi>Temple,</hi> cannot appeare.</p>
            <p>8. We have not yet any experiment of our new <hi>Clergie,</hi> who are many
of them <hi>branches</hi> of the old <hi>ſtock,</hi> and ſo may weild the Government too
much of the <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> Faction, as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> did with the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
becauſe they were not naturall <hi>Iews.</hi> It is not ſafe truſting a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
too far into thoſe hands. Our Brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> have been more
uſed to the way of Presbytery, and may better truſt one another upon mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
experience, then we can yet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:102005:3"/>
9. We experience in part ſome remainders of Prelacy working in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which ſhewes a conſtitution not ſo cleare nor pure as the Diſciples of
Chriſt ſhould have; then whether it be ſafe committing the power too
ſuddenly: For though I queſtion not but ſome may be like the <hi>ten,</hi> yet
there are others like the <hi>two Brethren</hi> who ſtrove which ſhould be <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,</hi>
till the Lord ended the difference, <hi>It ſhall not be ſo amongſt you.</hi> We
find the hotteſt Controverſie is now moved about Church-government;
and there hath been moſt written and ſpoken this way, and in moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
Now when the contention for power is ſo much, and the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie
ſtreames moſt in Government, we may ſoon diſcerne diſpoſitions.
Well, is it good parting with the ſtakes yet while there is ſuch quarrelling
for them, &amp; when one party cannot but take it for an injury, if wholly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to the other? It is to be feared, there is too much of man, becauſe the
bias runs moſt in theſe times towards this one truth of government, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other are wholly ſet by, which might well be lookt upon with it; which
if there were not a Principle in man more fitted for a truth of this kind
then any other, would not be: But every truth hath its age and ſeaſon.
This only for caution.</p>
            <p>10. There is no Religion eſtabliſhed by State, but there is ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
in the two Powers, and ſome compliancy betwixt the Civill
and Eccleſiaſticall; ſo as the eſtabliſhing the one, will draw with it ſome
motions in the other: And we all ſee how hazardous it is to diſintereſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in the Civill part, even in Kingdomes that are more firme, as <hi>France,</hi>
where the Proteſtants are partly allowed their Religion in pay for their
Civill engagements; and ſo in other States. And ſure I am, that State is
moſt free, where the conſcience is leaſt ſtraitned, where the Tares and
the Wheat grow together till the harveſt.</p>
            <p>11. Our parties or diſſenting Brethren being now together, and claſped
by intereſt againſt the common enemy, this foundation of common unity
is ſuch as may draw in both affections and judgements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not too ſuddenly
determined into Hereticks and Schiſmaticks: It is poſſible, while a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
is long ſuſpended, and time given for concluſion of things, Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
may be ſooner at peace: A fire let alone, may dye out under that
wood which ſtirred in would kindle it. The <hi>Contentions of Brethren are like
the ſtrong bars of a Caſtle; and a Brother that is offended is harder to be won
then a ſtrong City,</hi> Prov. 18. 19.</p>

               <p>Anſw.</p>
               <p>Yea, but the <hi>matteriall Patterne</hi> was more clearly left and known then
the <hi>Goſpell-patternes:</hi> The other were more in the <hi>letter,</hi> and theſe more in
the <hi>Spirit.</hi> Now there muſt be a <hi>proving all things,</hi> elſe there may be more
haſt then good ſpeed; and the Temple may be built by a falſe <hi>Paterne</hi> as
well as a <hi>true,</hi> and then better no Building, then no right <hi>Cedar</hi> to build
with. And there were <hi>Prophets</hi> then, who knew the <hi>periods</hi> of times, and
could Propheſie, as <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah;</hi> but none ſo exactly now; and
theſe knew both the <hi>faſhion</hi> and the <hi>time</hi> for Building. Yet who ought not
to haſten the Temple, if the Timber be ready, and if <hi>the Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets

and the ſending of the Spirit; but yet you ſee there was no Government,
till after, ſetled upon the people of God. And if <hi>Hereſies</hi> ſtir up their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
againſt the State, the Magiſtrate <hi>beares not the Sword in vaine?</hi> And
if morall tranſgreſſions, let the Magiſtrate be ſet on in every place to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Statutes; and Preachers every where ſent forth to publiſh the
Goſpell. And what if <hi>the Prince of Perſia</hi> withſtand for a while? <hi>Truth</hi> is
otherwiſe armed from heaven: Though <hi>Satan</hi> be in the wilderneſſe with
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet Chriſt ſhall conquer. It is the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and the <hi>Prelates</hi> Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
to keep up their ſuppoſed truths, by ſuſpecting every thing that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares
for an enemy. The Goſpell dares walk abroad with boldneſſe and
ſimplicity, when Traditions of men, like melancholy people, feare every
thing they meet will kill them: For the Angell that comes down from
