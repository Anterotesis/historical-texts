            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Corrupted</hi> COYN Made Good by CAESAR: <hi>Corrupted</hi> MAN Made Good by CHRIST the Power of GOD.</head>
            <p>ON the 15th and 16th of the Eleventh Month, 1695/6. The Lamentable Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Diſtraction of the People of this Land, about the badneſs of the Coyn, was before the view of my Mind; and how earneſt they are to have it Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, ſome Projecting this way, others that, generally concluding the beſt way is, to call in the Old (which is abuſed) and melt it down by Fire, and ſeparate the Baſe from the Fine, and ſo make the Fine into New, putting thereon the true Value, Figure and Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s Authority; ſo the Cauſe of Confuſion and Diſtraction being removed, the Effects thereof would ceaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereupon,</hi> It ran through my Mind to this Effect; Even after this manner will the Lord deal with the People (not only of this Land, but with all People) of all Lands and Nations, who are in the ſight of the Lord grown <hi>Corrupted,</hi> are out of, or have loſt his Image of <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Holineſs;</hi> ſome retaining only the likeneſs thereof, and that very dimly too, hardly to be diſcern'd, being much <hi>Clipt</hi> and <hi>Deformed,</hi> that there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding want of <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Value</hi> (being weighed in the Ballance of the Sanctuary) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of which the Lord is diſpleaſed, and remains ſo to be, until the Cauſe be removed.</p>
            <p>Others are ſo groſly <hi>Corrupted,</hi> even to that degree, as that they cannot be in the ſight of God allowed <hi>Currant</hi> and <hi>Paſſable;</hi> but <hi>Reprobate Silver</hi> (God doth, and) Men ſhall call them, <hi>becauſe the Lord hath rejected them,</hi> Jer, 6. 30. And the chief Cauſe and Reaſon thereof is Peoples <hi>Sins,</hi> which they love, and wherein they live, many not yet being willing to live out of them while they live on this ſide the Grave, though Chriſt Jeſus, the Lord from Heaven, the quickening Spirit, is come to put an end to <hi>Sin,</hi> and bring in everlaſting Righteouſneſs, according to <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prophecy, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
            <p>For that day which the Prophets ſaw, and through the Holy Ghoſt Propheſied ſhould come <hi>(Zech.</hi> 13. 1, 2, 9. and <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 2. 3.) is certainly come, becauſe the light thereof doth ſhine into the dark Hearts of People, without reſpect of Perſons, ſhewing unto every one, at one time or other, their preſent States and Conditions; inſomuch that a Child which is capable to uſe its Tongue to tell a Lye, by virtue of the in-ſhining there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, is meaſurably able to Judge, that a Lye is not Good, but Bad, as alſo the Lyer; and that telling Truth is not Bad, but Good. The ſame ſheweth the Drunkard, that Drunkenneſs is Bad, and not Good, and that God is not the mover thereunto, but the Devil, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now if all People would believe in the Light of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, wherewith he hath Enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> John 1. 9. and obey it, and walk therein, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7. as the Nations of them that are Saved ſhall, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 24. They would find that Virtue and Power therein, which is able to <hi>Conſume, Burn up</hi> and <hi>Separate,</hi> the <hi>Droſs</hi> and <hi>Tin,</hi> which is their <hi>Sins,</hi> and purifie them throughout in Body, Soul, and Spirit, from all <hi>Corruptions</hi> and <hi>Defilements,</hi> and ſtamp upon them the Image and Likeneſs of the Living God, <hi>to wit, Purity</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> without which none ſhall ever ſee the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 14. and in which all ever have, do, and for ever ſhall ſee, and find acceptance with God; which that all may do, who yet do not, is the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of my Soul.</p>
