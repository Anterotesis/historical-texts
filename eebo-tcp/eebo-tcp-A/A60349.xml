            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>ABout seventeen years ago, a gracioas Woman (one of that Flock which was by Divine Providence committed to my charge) sorely laboured under many Doubts, which created her much disquiet. In her agonies she frequently repaired to me for help, which according to the Grace given, I did most readily afford her. But by those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsion-sits, which almost every day return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, her memory was rendered so labil and unfaithful, that all I said made no abiding impression. Every time she came to me, she brought with her the same perplexing thoughts, and I had my work to do again. Thereupon I resolved to draw up in Verse her Doubts, and my Answers, and gave them to her in writing, in hope that her
<pb facs="tcp:105571:37"/>
memory would more easily retain something which might befriend her; at least, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving these things by her, she would make use of them as occasion required, and so save both me and her self much labour.</p>
                  <p>Through the goodness of God, my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation was not disappointed, she found much benefit, as she did most freely and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledg; and through mercy past the remainder of her days in a pleasant calm. But, good Soul, she could not hide Gods loving kindness within her breast, but communicated to others these lines, which she counted a treasure; several Copies were taken and disperst, some sent into remote parts, which found good acceptance, and were not without their fruit.</p>
                  <p>Mine own Copy of them lay dormant long after; indeed I concluded it lost, until about two years since one of my Children found it among my loose Papers, and with joy brought it to me. Since then, one borrowed it, and another, and more, of which several took the pains to transcribe it. And I have of late been so prest to make it publick, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb facs="tcp:105571:37"/>
to my own thoughts and resolution, I have been constrained to yield unto their importunity.</p>
                  <p>Certain it is, that Doubtings do abound in gracious Souls, though wicked men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a fatal peace, and are not in trouble like them. The Devil like a roaring Lion gapes upon, and worries those that have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scap'd out of his snares; whilest he rocks his vassals, and doth his utmost to keep them asleep in the cradle of carnal security. Those that have true Faith, have also many fears. But those that are strangers to Faith, are commonly free from them.</p>
                  <p>Doubts are good signs, yet bad company. They damp the spirit, and weaken the hand, and cover with a cloud that face which should shine. They keep Faith from flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they deprive the Christian of that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort which the breasts of Gospel-promises would yield him; they rob God and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of that honour which the cheerful lives of Saints would bring them; and they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the converses of holy persons many times very unacceptable to their brethren; though
<pb facs="tcp:105571:38"/>
we should bear one anothers burdens, and be very compassionate unto such as are deserted, buffeted, and disconsolate.</p>
                  <p>It is the unquestionable duty of Christs Ministers to be Messengers of peace as well as Sons of thunder; as to startle and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright sleeping sinners, so to revive drooping and sinking Saints. We are to comfort the people of God, by speaking to their case, and to their hearts. To strengthen the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees, is a part, yea a very sweet part of our work. We have no dominion over their faith, no, none at all; but should be helpers of their joy, and rejoice to be so.</p>
                  <p>Vpon this Errand and Design is this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle piece sent abroad into the world; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question many will find themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the things contained in it, and I hope some will find advantage. The answer to these Doubts are fetcht from the Word of God, and grounded upon it, and such are most cordial. Nay none but such will bring healing to a wounded, and settlement to a tumultuating spirit. Let none be offended at
<pb facs="tcp:105571:38"/>
the manner of composure, but remember the reason before given, and call to mind <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms, together with the Apostles Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, <hi>To admonish one another in Psalms and Hymns, and spiritual Songs.</hi> A blessing from heaven go along with this little work; and if thou receivest any spiritual benefit by it, he hath his end, who is</p>

                        <l>There's added to his weight an hundred pound.</l>
                        <l>So if thou wilt consider what thou wast</l>

                        <l>With faithfulness things past, with things that are.</l>
                        <l>And thy attainments do thou not deny,</l>

                        <l>Besides in nature are more ways than one</l>
                        <l>Of growing and increase. For when the Sun</l>
                        <l>Makes his approach in Spring, the plants do shoot,</l>
                        <l>And flourish upward, then again their root</l>
                        <l>On his withdrawing from them, spreads, and so</l>
                        <l>Now upward and anon downward they grow.</l>
                        <l>Both growths in season are, both needful be,</l>
                        <l>One graceth, t' other stablishes the tree.</l>
                        <l>Thus in the Christian; sometimes Faith improves</l>
                        <l>And makes advance; then the next turn is Loves,</l>
                        <l>Which riseth to a flame, from whence there springs</l>
                        <l>Raptures of joy. The soul then sits and sings,</l>
                        <l>The table now is spread, the cup runs o're,</l>
                        <l>In which it doth delight, and God adore;</l>
                        <l>Of him it makes its boast; th' affections</l>

                        <l>From Satan cool, the Lion doth not roar.</l>
                        <l>Now evidences are clearer and more</l>

                        <l>Nay more, he stands oblig'd. His Father gave</l>

                        <l>He is accountable for every one:</l>

                        <l>And therefore he hath promis'd to impart</l>
