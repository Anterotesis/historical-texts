            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Worshipfull, amongst the manifold points of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion, the trueth of the Doctrine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination is worthy serious and sober study for the sound vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereof. For first, it is something diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult &amp; obscure. Secondly, because it is by some eagerly impugned, as a friuolous and forged inuention of mans braine. Thirdly, diuers opinions haue passed from diuers me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuersly about this one point; whereas


<pb facs="tcp:3741:3"/>
notwithstanding there is but one truth, and one definite and constant sentence to be found in holy writ concerning it. Fourthly, this one doctrine doth giue very good eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and an ample demonstration of Gods infinite mercie and exact iustice. Fiftly, it affordeth some taste of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found and impenetrable counsell. Sixtly, it doth notably manifest his admirable wisdome and policie, and the incorruptible purity of his nature, who wisely disposeth all things, and vseth euen euils without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice, and the least receipt or infusion of corruption; and all for the manifestation of the glory of his Name, and of the splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his renowmed properties. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly, it confoundeth the common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill of many desperate and infatuated A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists, who would make Gods predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the pillar of their sensuall security, and secure sensualitie. Lastly, it ministreth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding comfort vnto those, who renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the kingdome of Sinne, do liue like


<pb facs="tcp:3741:3"/>
Saints in the kingdome of Grace. First, because it is not possible for any such to sinne with full consent of heart. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because no personall merits are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them. Thirdly, because the Spirit of God abideth in them, who is busy within the hiue of their hearts as a Bee, and worketh them like waxe. Fourthly, because God hath eternally predestinated them to eternall ioyes, and those also incomprehensible and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable. Fiftly, because God hath in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vouchsafed that to them being but an handfull, which hee hath denyed to whole heapes besides. Sixtly, for that they being elected, can in no wise perish, for the counsell of the Lord shall stand for euer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 11. And hee loueth them with an euerlasting loue, <hi>Ieremy</hi> 3. 4. Though a Mother should forget her Child, yet he will not forget them, for he hath grauen them vpon the palme of his hand, <hi>Isay</hi> 49. 15, 16. therefore hee


<pb facs="tcp:3741:4"/>
will confirme them vnto the end, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 8. and by his power keepe them vnto saluation, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. He will loue them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stantly, though he visit their transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions with rods, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 32, 33. He will neuer turne away from them, though he <note place="margin">Iere. 32. 40. Ioh. 16. 12.</note> take them by the neck (as <hi>Iob</hi> speaketh) and beat them, though he cut their reines and breake them, and though he pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth their gall vpon the ground, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vpon them like a Gyant. <hi>Ioseph</hi> did affect his brethren entirely, though hee spake roughly to them. Hee may also sometimes let them fall, as a louing Nurse may her child, but he will lift them vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; therefore howsoeuer they may fall, yet they shall not fall away. Indeed <note place="margin">Piptein.</note> they may leaue their first loue, as the <note place="margin">Ecpiptein</note> Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> did, but they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer leaue to loue at all, if euer they loued <note place="margin">Reu. 2. 4.</note> truly. For (as <hi>Paul</hi> sayth) <hi>Loue doth neuer fall away,</hi> it may be lessened, but it cannot <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13 8.</note> be lost. In like manner, their faith may

be couered, as the Sunne with a duskie cloud in a gloomy day: or as the trees are with snow sometimes in winter; but yet it continueth firmely fixed (though now and then eclipsed) in the sphaere of the heart, and keepeth sap in the roote. For the righteous man is as a tree planted by the riuers of waters, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 3. and is built by that great builder of heauen and earth vpon a rock, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 18. These comforts will this one doctrine affoord, being throughly pondered and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. And no doubt these and the like considerations mooued that holy and learned man of blessed memory, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish this present treatise for the benefit of the Church, and the same haue also inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs to turne it out of the toong where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he wrote it, into the English, for their profit who are ignorant in the other; and the rather, because it is contriued and penned very plainely, soundly, and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly, as the subiect will permit.

The Pelagians held, that God predestinated men to life or death, as he did foresee that they would by their naturall free will receiue or reiect grace offered. They taught, that it was in mans power to beleeue, or not to beleeue: they placed the causes of saluation in men themselues out of God, and held, that the Elect might fall from grace and perish.</p>
            <p>Others hold, that albeit the Lord ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth some of his meere mercy without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of any thing in them, that yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth those which are reiected, because he did foresee that they would reiect his grace offered vnto them in the Gospell.

Many of the Romish synagogue do teach, that men are elected for their foreseene faith, and meritorious works. And it is the common opinion of all Papists, that the Elect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be certaine and sure of their election, vnlesse it be extraordinarily by some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall reuelation, and singular priuiledge. Many also there are, which would not haue this doctrine publickly taught by the Minister; but without good reason. For first, as the Minister must not search the secrets of God which are not reuealed, so he must not suppresse or hide that which is reuealed. For things <hi>Reuealed, belong to</hi>

               <hi>vs and to our children for euer,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth.


<pb facs="tcp:3741:8"/>
Therefore as we may not search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those things which God will haue kept secret, so we may in no wise be wholly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of those things which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto vs. But this doctrine of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, is very plentifully and perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously reuealed and deliuered vnto vs in the Scriptures. Secondly, as the word of God omitteth nothing which is neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be knowne, touching the saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our soules, so wee must know, that it teacheth nothing but that which is profitable, and worthy to be learned of all. For that speach of <hi>Paul</hi> to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes is true of all the writings of the Prophets and Apostles also, <hi>VVhatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer things were written, were written for</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4</note> 
               <hi>our learning.</hi> But the word of God doth teach this doctrine of Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, as is euident by many places therein: therefore it is necessary and fit to be taught of the Minister, and to be learned of the people. Thirdly, it is the duetie of all faithfull Ministers to teach all the counsell of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> sayth <note place="margin">Act. 20. 27.</note> hee did: but Predestination is a part


<pb facs="tcp:3741:8"/>
of Gods counsell: therefore it ought to bee deliuered of vs vnto the people of God; alwayes remembring, that wee applie our selues to your capacities, and teach it orderly (as occasion serueth) keeping our selues in all sobrietie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of the Word. Fourthly, Christ commaundeth the Gospell to be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched <note place="margin">Mark. 10. 15.</note> to euery creature: but this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine belongeth to the Gospell, and therefore is to bee preached vnto the vnlearned, as to the learned. Lastly, all Ministers are bound to keepe back nothing which is profitable, but to shew <note place="margin">Act. 20 20.</note> it as <hi>Paul</hi> did: But the doctrine of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination is very profitable. For first, it letteth vs see the omnisciencie, the omnipotencie, the soueraignetie, and immutable nature of God. Secondly, it serueth to increase and confirme our faith and hope, concerning the eternall felicitie of our soules and bodyes; seeing it is not founded vpon our selues, or vpon any sandie foundation, but vpon the constant and vnchangeable good pleasure of God. Thirdly, it teacheth vs not to wonder at


<pb facs="tcp:3741:9"/>
the small number of beleeuers, and at the hardnesse and blindnesse of many mens hearts and minds. For it sheweth, that God hath elected but a fewe, and hath <note place="margin">Math. 20. 16.</note> passed by many, leauing them vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and deliuering them vp into the hands of the Diuell. Fourthly, it serueth to strengthen and comfort vs in all affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and to arme vs against all the fiery darts of the Diuell, and the fury of his lims. For it sheweth, that nothing can separate vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the loue of God, and that all things <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28, 39.</note> worke for the best vnto them that loue God, euen vnto them that are called of his purpose. All stormes and waues of woe shall passe ouer, and in the end we shall rest in the quiet hauen of euerlasting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse. Fiftly, this doctrine stayeth vs from taking offence at the Apostacy of many professors: for it sheweth vs, that all is not gold which glisters, and that some stand for a time, and some stand fast for euer. <hi>If they had been of vs</hi> (sayth <hi>Iohn) they should haue continued with vs.</hi> Sixtly, it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:3741:9"/>
good will toward vs, hath elected vs vnto eternall life, and the fruition of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall glory in the heauens. Seuenthly, it serueth to teach vs humility, and to beate downe the pride of our harts. For it shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Gods grace, and not our good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is the originary cause of our welfare and saluation. The cause, which mooued God to choose vs rather then many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, was not our foreseene preparations, or meritoriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> sundry vses which might be made of this one doctrine) it teacheth vs to ascribe the glory of our saluation to God alone, and to walke thankefully before him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting the gratitude of our hearts by our religious, righteous, and sober liues. To conclude, some are so far out of loue with this doctrine, that they can scarce with patience indure to heare it spoken of. And many licencious and prophane persons do very wickedly abuse it, to take vnto themselues liberty of lasci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

if damnation be my destiny, I can neuer be saued: And therefore it skilleth not how I liue; for if God haue appointed me to be saued, I shall be saued, though I do iust nothing: and it he haue determined that I shall be damned, I shall neuer es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape it, though I liue neuer so well.

If a man had a medicine able to cure all diseases, and would not giue it any sauing some few, they were wonderfully indebted to him.

If three men were in danger of drowning or burning, and a man should come and deliuer one of them, and leaue the other two to the danger, all men might well say, that he fauoured him more then the other. By our sinnes we were all in danger to be drowned in that sulphury lake, and to be consumed with the fire of Gods wrath, as well as the Reprobates. Our sinnes deserue it. But Christ hath set himselfe betweene his Father and vs. He hath taken no notice (as it were) of them: and vs only, who are elected, he hath redeemed.

            <p>God giueth his holy Spirit to his Elect only, who in Gods appointed time ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note place="margin">Priuil. 24</note> his habitation in them, who doth also sweep the floores of their spirits with the hand of his grace, and the beesome of his word, and trimmeth vp the houses of their hearts with the sweet and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant

Hee constituteth a kingdome within them: hee ruleth them with the strength of his arme, and the scepter of his word. He stablisheth his throne with iustice and mercy: he fostereth the part regenerate, he bridleth and tameth the rebell, euen the rebellious corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the heart, and by little and little consumeth it. As for the Reprobate; their hearts are the dens of the Diuell, and the cabins of sinne, stincking loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somly like a dead carryon. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a kingdome within them: but the Diuell is the King, Sinne is the Queene. His Throne is wickednes, his Scepter is iniquity, his Lawes are the liberty of the flesh, his rewards are death, and they

            <p>As the Elect may haue Grace, so it is possible for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to grow in grace: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Priuil. 25. 2. Pet. 3. 18. 1. Pet. 2. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth vs, <hi>To grow in grace, and in the knowledge of Christ,</hi> and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth also how we may grow. But for the Reprobate; as they are void of all true la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing grace, so they grow not there in, for they can not increase in that which they want.

But God hath


<pb facs="tcp:3741:27"/>
not vouchsafed the gift of godly sorow and true repentance to the Reprobate. It belongs only to Gods Elect.

As lead being cast into the water, can not but sinke, so the Reprobate can not but sinne. And as a Mill-stone lying in the bottome of the Sea, can not come vp, so the Reprobate beeing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerwhelmed in the bottomlesse pit of iniquitie, can not repent. Though it were possible to remoue a Mountayne out of his place, yet it were more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to remoue a Reprobate from his corruptions. Hee may mooue, but hee will not remooue. Hee may turne, but hee cannot returne. As it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for him to reuiue, who is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained


<pb facs="tcp:3741:28"/>
to perpetuall death: so it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for him to reuiue from sinne, whom the fountaine of all life hath righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously forsaken, and deliuered for euer vnto Sathan, to hold captiue in the graue of sinne, and in the darke and deadly dungeon of iniquity.</p>
            <p>The children of God haue the spirit of prayer, and with boldnesse may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach <note place="margin">Priuil. 26.</note> vnto the throne of his grace, and put vp their suites vnto him. The King will permit a true subiect to come into his presence and speake vnto him, when a rebell or traytour shall finde no such fauour. A Kings sonne may speake vnto his father, when others are not permitted so to do. We are the sonnes of God, and the seruants of his sonne; therefore we may boldly in the name of our elder brother, present our selues before him, and put vp our supplications to him; and the rather, because he knoweth and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth vs. For as the Apostle sayth, <hi>The foundation of God remaineth sure, and hath this seale, The Lord knoweth who are</hi>

               <hi>his.</hi> But the Reprobate and their prayers


<pb facs="tcp:3741:28"/>
are abominable in his sight. They want the spirit of prayer, and either can not pray at all, or not in the right manner. Neither can they approach with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnto GOD, seeing they haue no part in Christ, nor Christ in them. They cannot pray with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidence to be heard; seeing they are destitute as well of faith, as of the fauour of God.</p>
            <p>GOD accepteth the sincere will and <note place="margin">Priuil. 27.</note> feruent desires of his faithfull and elect children to beleeue, repent and obey for faith, repentance &amp; obedience. For <hi>As</hi>

               <hi>a father hath compassion on his children, so hath the Lord compassion on them that feare him. He will spare them, as a man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mala. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>spareth his owne sonne.</hi> But fathers vse to take in good part their childrens works, so they do them with care and diligence, though not so perfectly and exactly as indeed were meet. In like manner, if we will and with an honest heart desire to do well, though we do it very weakely, God doth notwithstanding take all in good part, and regardeth not the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the worke. A desire of grace


<pb facs="tcp:3741:29"/>
is one degree of grace, and a will to do well, is with God accounted doing well. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> sayth, <hi>If there be a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. Cor. 8. 12.</note> 
               <hi>hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi> That which he saith of giuing almes, is true in the performance of all other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. If there be in a man a ready and willing mind to beleeue, repent, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, though he do not these things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly, or so well as many of his brethren do; yet God, for the merits and interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Sonne, accepteth both of him and his imperfit works, and in mercy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth him. <hi>Dauid,</hi> besides his dayly infirmities, did thrice grieuously offend God, and yet he told <hi>Salomon,</hi> that if he <note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:3741:29"/>
well, it will plainely appeare, that hee meaneth no other thing, then that hee should labour and seeke to please him in all things: because hee setteth his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Dauid</hi> before his eyes as a patterne to follow, and because else-where we reade that hee maketh the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise vnto him, onely requiring of him, <hi>To indeuour himselfe to doe hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 28. 7.</note> as hee had begun. Now this is a very comfortable doctrine. For when a man considereth that GOD respects his weake obedience and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest heart, and accounteth the will to doe, for the deed done, his heart is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, his conscience is appeased, his mind is setled, and beholding the infinite loue of God, he is rauished with ioy, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to magnifie his mercy, and to struggle against the corruption of his heart, to please him in doing all things which are pleasing in his sight. Now, lest we should beguile our selues (for mans heart is a mine of subtilty) in thinking we desire, &amp; will to beleeue, repent &amp; obey, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as we either do not at al, or do but as

I come now briefly to set downe the notes of Election vnto life, and to shew how a man may come to be truly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded in his conscience, that he shall be saued.

For faith, whereby wee <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 17.</note> are perswaded of Gods speciall grace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, is ordinarily wrought by hearing of the word preached. 2. Let him wage warre with his infidelity, and let him not listen to Sathan tempting him to doubting, or desperation. 3. Let him beware of pride and presumption, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trusting to his owne goodnes, nor obliuious of Gods infinite iustice. 4. Let him often and earnestly pray for this benefit, and desire that GOD would giue him his Spirit, which may witnes with him that hee is the chosen childe of God. 5. Let him reuerently receiue the Sacrament, and meditate often of his Baptisme. For the Sacraments are pledges of Gods loue, and serue to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease our faith.

               <hi>of men, which wee mystically call two cities, is that which is predestinated to raigne eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally with God: and the other to suffer eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall punishment with the diuell. Fulgentius</hi> saith also, <hi>That in Gods predestination there</hi>

               <hi>an admirable manner, hath foreelected some, and forsaken others in their corruptions.</hi> And the more learned Schoolemen vse to say, that God for the more full manifestation of his perfection hath predestinated some in manifesting his goodnes by the rule of mercie, and damned others, in represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his perfection by the rule of iustice.</p>
            <p>The common meanes of accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this counsell is two-fold; the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the permission of the fall. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is that by which God made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole man of nothing according to his owne image; but yet changeable, and endued with a naturall life. The permission of the fall is, whereby God did iustly suffer <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> and his posteritie to fall away, in that he did not hinder them when he was able; as being indeed bound to none to hinder.


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3741:47"/>
And God is said not to hinder euill, when he ceaseth after a sort from his operation, not illuminating the minde, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining the will to obey his voyce. This permission of the euill of fault is by Gods foreknowledge and will, but yet only for the greater good of all: which would bee hindred if God did not suffer euill. For if there were not sinne, there should bee no place for the patience of Martyrs, and for the sacrifice of Christ offered vpon the crosse, which doth infinitely exceede all the sinne of the whole world. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith well: <hi>God hath iudged it better to doe</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Enchir. cap. 27.</note> 
               <hi>good with euils, than to permit no euill to be.</hi> In like manner <hi>Gregorie</hi> saith: <hi>In his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere</hi>

               <hi>iudgement he suffereth euill to be done, but withall he doth in mercie forecast, what good things he may bring to passe, by these euils, which hee doth ordaine by his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For what greater sinne is there than that by which we doe all die? and what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter goodnesse than that by which we are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from death? And doubtlesse but that Adam sinned, our Redeemer should not haue taken our flesh vpon him—. Whiles God was to be borne man, the Almightie did foresee


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3741:48"/>
that hee would make of that euill, for which they were to die, a good which should be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than that euill. The greatnesse of which good what faithfull man is there who doth not see how wonderfully it doth excell? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great are the euils, which we suffer by the desert of the first fault: but what faithfull man would not rather endure worse, than to be without so great a Redeemer?</hi> And in this respect elsewhere he calleth the fall of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, <hi>foelicem culpam,</hi> a happie fault. That <note place="margin">In bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. Cerci Pasc.</note> which I haue said of the permission of the fall, I doe also say of the fall permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; sauing that the permission is a meanes of the decree by it selfe, but the fall is a meanes (of accomplishing the decree) onely by the ordination of God, who draweth good out of euill.</p>
            <p>This fall permitted commeth not to passe but God being willing, neither doth it come to passe contrariwise or otherwise than God permitteth, neither can it any further be than hee doth permit. Yet the will of God is not the cause of the fall, but the will of man left vnto it selfe by God, and moued by the suggestion of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than; which will appeare by this simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude:


<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3741:48"/>
I build a house subiect to change and falling, which notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding would continue many yeeres, if it might bee free from the annoyance of windes: yea, if I would but vnderprop it, when the storme commeth, it would continue stable. But as soone as the windes begin to rage, I do not vnderprop it, and it is my will not to vnderprop it, because it is my pleasure so to doe, thereupon the house being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therbeaten falleth downe. I see the fall, and in part I will it, because now when I could very easily haue hindred the fall, yet I would not. And although thus farre I doe will the fall, in so much as it is my will not to hinder it: yet the cause of the fall is not to be imputed vnto me, that did not vnderproppe it, but to the winds which cast it downe. So God leauing <hi>Adam</hi> vnto himselfe, that hee might be prooued by tentation, and that it might appeare what the creature is able to doe, the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ceasing for a time to helpe and guide, is not to bee accounted the cause of this fall. For he did not encline the minde to sinne, hee did not infuse any corruption, neither did he withdraw any gift, which


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3741:49"/>
he did bestow in the creation: onely it pleased him to deny or not to conferre confirming grace. The proper cause of the fall was the diuell attempting our ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, and <hi>Adams</hi> will, which when it began to bee prooued by tentations, did not desire Gods assistance, but volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie bent it selfe to fall away.</p>

            <p>The decree of election is that whereby God hath ordained certaine men to his <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 5.</note> glorious grace in the obtaining of their


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3741:49"/>
saluation and heauenly life by Christ.</p>
            <p>In the decree of election according <note place="margin">These acts are vsually called the decree and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the decree.</note> to Gods determination there is (as wee conceiue) a double act. The former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the end, the latter concernes the meanes tending to the end. This the holy Ghost seemeth to me to haue taught very euidentlie, Rom. 9. 11. <hi>That the purpose which is according to election might remain.</hi> Heere wee see that <hi>Paul</hi> distinguisheth Gods eternall purpose and election, and placeth in his decree a certaine election in the first place before the purpose of damning or sauing. And in Rom. the 8. 29. 30. <hi>Those which he knew before, he also predestinated to bee made like to the image of his son—.Whom he predestinated, them also he called—.</hi>In which wordes <hi>Paul</hi> distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth betwene the decree, and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution thereof, which he maketh to bee in these three, Vocation, Iustification, and Glorification. Moreouer he distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the decree into two acts, foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, whereby hee doth acknowledge some men for his owne, before the rest: and predestination, whereby he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined from eternitie to make them


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3741:50"/>
like vnto Christ. In like manner <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth, 1. Pet. 1. 2, where hee saith, <hi>that the faithful are elected according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg of God the father vnto sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the spirit.</hi> If any man shall say that by foreknowledge in these places wee must vnderstand (as many would) the foreknowledge or foreseeing of future faith, he is manifestly deceiued. For whom God foreknew, them hee did predestinate that they should bee like to Christ, that is, that they should bee made iust, and the sonnes of God: for <hi>Paul</hi> addeth, Rom. 8. 29. <hi>That he might be the first borne among many brethren.</hi> But those, which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated to be iust, and to be the sonnes of God, are also predestinated to beleeue, because Adoption and Righteousnes are receiued by faith. Now we cannot right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, that God doth first foreknow that men will beleeue, and afterwards prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beleeue; because that God hath therfore foreknowne that those shall beleeue, whom hee did foreknow would beleeue, because hee did decree that they should beleeue.

               <hi>hath foreknowne, them he hath predestinated,</hi> that is, <hi>by grace conferred hee hath prepared that they should beleeue the word preached.</hi> Moreouer the word <hi>(know)</hi> when it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto God speaking of the creature, doth very often signifie to imbrace or approue. Psal. 1. 6. <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked shall perish.</hi> Matth. 7. 23. <hi>Depart from me yee workers of iniquitie, I neuer knew you.</hi> Furthermore, the prescience &amp; purpose of God are by the holy Ghost put for one and the same thing. 2. Tim. 2. 19. <hi>The foundation of God remaineth sure—the Lord knoweth who are his:</hi> Rom. 11. 2. <hi>Those whom God foreknew are said to be elected according to the election of grace,</hi> vers. 5. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foreknowledge mentioned by <hi>Paul</hi> doth not signifie the foreknowledge of faith, or of any other vertue in those which were to bee elected. It is also the iudgement of <hi>Augustine,</hi> that predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">De perseu. sanct. lib. cap. 18. Rom. 11. 1. 2</note> is sometimes vnderstood by presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, euen in the foresaid place. <hi>Hath God cast away his people which hee knew before?</hi> And he saith that, <hi>Those are sonnes in Gods


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3741:51"/>
foreknowledge, whose names are written in their fathers register, so as they shall neuer be raised out. Cyrill</hi> saith also that <hi>Christ know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his sheepe, electing and foreseeing them</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Expos. in Ioh. 7. cap. 6</note> 
               <hi>vnto euerlasting life.</hi> As the Apostle saith Rom. 11. 12. <hi>God hath not cast away his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which hee knew before. For as the Lord is said not to know those, whom he doth reiect: as when he answered the foolish virgins say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Matth. 25. 12. <hi>Verilie I say vnto you, I know you not: so hee is said to know those, whom he doth predestinate and fore-appoint vnto saluation.</hi> And <hi>Thomas</hi> expoundeth that place in the 8. to the Romanes after <note place="margin">Idem Hugo de sanct. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In the decree of election the first act is a purpose, or rather a part and beginning <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. People which God challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto himselfe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> of the diuine purpose, whereby God doth take certaine men which are to be created vnto his euerlasting loue and fauour pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by the rest, and by taking maketh them vessels of mercie and honour: and this act is of the sole will of God, without


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3741:51"/>
any respect either of good or euill in the creature. And God doth wrong none, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee chuse not all; because hee is tied to none: &amp; because he hath absolute soueraigntie and authoritie ouer all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. We that are but men giue leaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, especially vnto our friends, to do at their pleasure in many things as they themselues list, and to vse their owne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions. The rich man is kinde to which poore person hee pleaseth; and of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers he doth adopt one, and will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt another, and that without offring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iniurie. Now that libertie, which wee yeeld vnto man, must much more bee granted vnto God.</p>
            <p>The second act is the purpose of sauing or conferring glorie, whereby hee doth ordaine or set apart the very same men, which were to fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> vnto salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and celestiall glorie. This act is in no wise to be seuered from the former, but to be distinguished in the minde (for orders sake and for the better vnfolding of it) for as by the former men were ordained vnto grace: so by this latter the meanes are subordained whereby grace may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3741:52"/>
and manifested: and therefore this latter maketh a way for the execution and accomplishing of the former. Moreouer, this act hath no impulsiue cause ouer and beside the good pleasure of God: and it is with regard to Christ the Mediatour, in whom all are elected to grace and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to dreame of any election out of him is against all sense: because hee is the foundation of election to bee execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in regard of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning, the meanes, and the end. Lastly, this act is not of men to bee created as was the former, but of men falne away. Therfore in this act God respecteth the corrupted masse of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>Furthermore in this second act there are fiue degrees, the ordaining of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, the promising of him being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, the exhibiting of him being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, the applying of him being exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or to bee exhibited, and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the application. It is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like which <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, <hi>The kingdome of</hi> 
               <note place="margin">De verbis libri sapien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae.</note> 
               <hi>God is granted, promised, manifested, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. It is granted in predestination, promised in vocation, manifested in iustification, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued

or receiued in glorification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ordaining of a Mediatour is that whereby the second person being the Sonne of God, is appointed from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie to bee a Mediatour betweene God himselfe and men.

            <p>With the promise there is ioyned an exhortation, or commandement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue: which is more generall than the promise; because the promise is made onely to beleeuers; but the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is giuen to beleeuers and vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers also.

But I answere, first that God in his commandements and promises doth not vtter whatsoeuer hee hath decreed, but doth in part onely so farre forth propound his will, as he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it expedient for the saluation of the elect, and the gouerning of all. By his


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3741:54"/>
commandements therefore he sheweth what he liketh, and what hee willeth that we should doe to him, not what hee will doe to vs or in vs. And God who willeth not all things alike in all, doth will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion in some only in respect of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, exhortation and meanes: in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he willeth it also as touching the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of working it.

God commanded <hi>Isaiah</hi> to declare vnto <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> his death: and hee did also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <note place="margin">Esa. 38.</note> destruction vnto the Niniuites <note place="margin">Ion. 3. 4.</note> within fourtie daies: and yet he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to put neither of them both in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.

The humane wil of Christ did with <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 3.</note> an holy dissention in some sort will deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from the agony of death, which notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding the diuine willed not. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>

Neither must this seeme strange; for one good thing as it is and remaineth good, may bee different from another thing that is good. Thirdly, thou biddest thy debter pay his debt, though in the meane time thou dost not make him able: why may not God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for iust causes command that, which he himselfe will not do?</p>
            <p>The exhibiting of the Mediator is that, whereby the Sonne of God being borne <note place="margin">

                  </gap>.</note> man in the fulnes of time doth pay the price of rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption to God for the sins of men. The vertue and efficacie of this price being paid, in respect of merit and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is infinite; but yet it must be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, for it is either potentiall or actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. The potentiall efficacie is, wherby the price is in it selfe sufficient to redeeme e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3741:55"/>
one without exception from his sins, albeit there were a thousand worlds of men. But if we consider that actuall effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, the price is payd in the counsell of God, and as touching the euent only for those which are elected and predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For the Sonne doth not sacrifice for those, for whom hee doth not pray: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to make intercession and to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice are conioyned: but hee prayeth one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the elect and for beleeuers, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 9. and by praying he offereth himselfe to his Father. verse 19. For (as <hi>Illyricus</hi> hath well obserued) this whole prayer in the 17. chapter is indeed (as he speaketh) an oblatory and expiatory prayer, or (as the Papists call that blasphemous forme) a Canon or rule of sacrifice, by which Christ hath offered himselfe a sacrifice to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the sinnes of the world. Therefore the price is appointed and limited to the elect alone by the Fathers decree, and the Sons intercession and oblation. Secondly Christ bare their person, and stood in their roome vpon the crosse, for whom he is a mediator: and consequently, whatsoeuer Christ did as a redeemer, the same did all <note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 6. Coloss. 3. 1.</note>


               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:3741:55"/>
those in him &amp; with him which are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: Christ dying, rising again, ascending &amp; sitting at the right hand of the Father, they also die with him, rise againe, ascend and sit at the right hand of God. Now that all these things can be truly said of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect only, and of such as beleeue, I proue it thus. To say that any one of the wicked, which are to perish for euer, is raised vp in Christ rising againe, is flat against the truth: because the raysing vp of Christ is (that I may so speake) his actuall absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their sins for whom he died: for euen as the Father by deliuering Christ to death, did in very deede condemne their sins imputed vnto Christ, for whom he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; so by raysing him vp from death, euen <hi>ipso facto</hi> he did absolue Christ from their sinnes, and did withall absolue them in Christ: but being absolued from their sins they shall not perish, but be saued. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that wicked man which perisheth for his sin, cannot be said to haue risen againe with Christ: and therefore Christ did not beare his person vpon the crosse. Thirdly the expiatory sacrifice sanctifieth those, for whom it is a sacrifice, as the holie

The sacrifice and sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appertaine to the same persons: and Christ is their perfect Sauiour, whom he saueth not only by meriting their saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but also by working it effectually. But Christ doth sanctifie only the elect and such as beleeue: therefore he was a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice only for them.

            <p>The decree of reprobation is a worke of Gods prouidence, whereby he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to passe by certaine men, in regard of supernaturall grace for the manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3741:58"/>
of his iustice and wrath in their due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: or, it is his will, whereby he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth some man to fall into sinne, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth the punishment of condemnation for sinne.</p>
            <p>It hath in like manner two actes. The first is the purpose to forsake some men, and to make knowen his iustice in them. This act hath a finall cause, but no impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue cause out of God. For it ariseth of Gods meere good pleasure, no respect had of good or euill in the creature. For the will of God is the cause of causes: therfore we must make our stand in it, and out of or beyond it no reason must be sought for: yea indeed there is nothing beyond it. Moreouer euery man (as <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 21.</note> auerreth) is vnto God, as a lumpe of clay in the potters hand: and therefore God according to his supreme authoritie doth make vessels of wrath, he doth not find them made. But hee should not make them, but find them made, if we say that God willed in his eternall counsell, to passe by men only as they are sinners, and not as they are men for causes most iust, though vnknowen to vs. Thirdly, if God


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3741:59"/>
did reiect men, because he foresaw that they would reiect him, reprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should not depend vpon God, but vpon men themselues. And this is all one, as if a man should say, that God foresaw that some would chuse him, and others refuse him. And the contempt of the Gospell doth not befall infants, which die out of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of the Gospell. Fourthly, <hi>Paul,</hi> who was a most skilful defender of Gods iustice, doth exclude all workes in the first place, out of this wonderfull election of one from another, made in the counsell of God: <hi>Not by worke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The second act is the ordaining of them to punishment or due destruction. This ordination in respect of the diuerse consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration thereof, may be distinguished: and so it is either simple or comparatiue. The simple ordination is that, wherby this man, suppose <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Iohn,</hi> is ordained to punishment. And this ordination is of the most iust will of God, yet not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of originall and actuall sinnes. For as men are actually damned for sin: so God hath decreed to damne them for the same sinne. Yet notwithstanding sin is not the cause of the decree of reprobation, but in regard of order it goeth before in Gods fore-knowledge, not that former, but this latter act. The ordination which stands in comparison is that, whereby one man and not another, and this man rather then that being in the like condition, is ordeined to


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3741:60"/>
punishment. This serueth to shew the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of Gods will, in the dispensation of supernaturall benefits. For in that God chuseth this man and not that, it declareth the libertie and very great perfection of God: and therefore vnder the name of an housholder, he challengeth the same vnto himselfe, when he saith: <hi>May I not do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>with my own what I list?</hi> And verely though God destroy and condemne all those whom he doth forsake, yet should he not be iniust. For we our selues in the daily killing and slaughtering of beasts will not be counted vniust, neither indeed are we: and yet in comparison of God we are not so much worth, as a flie is in respect of vs. If it be lawfull for thee to receine in, or to thrust out any out of thine house, because thou wilt; it were a point of desperate boldnes to take the same right from God in his house.</p>
            <p>The cause of this comparatiue ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is the sole wil of God, yea euen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect of any sinne at all.

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3741:66"/>
God willeth a thing not to bee, (for that, which is not, therefore is not, because hee willeth it shall not bee) and for certaine causes also hee willeth not to hinder some things, and consequently willeth that they shal come to passe; which things not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding hee doth not simplie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue. Or, it is the decree of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee willeth some thing, not in respect of approbation and effecting of it by himself, but only in respect of suffering it to be done by others. And here the thing which is to be done doth not depend vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods will, but onely vpon the will of the creature which falleth away: and with this will we say that God willed the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet not simplie but onely that it should come to passe. Now it is one thing to will a thing by it selfe, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to wil it as touching the euent. Moreouer hee willeth the euent of sinne, not by effecting it himselfe: but by forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or not hindring when he might if he would. And if we enquire of the order of willing, it is this, first and properly God doth will not to inhibit, and not to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sinne: and by consequent onely hee


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3741:67"/>
willeth the euent of sinne. For that which God doth nor hinder, doth therfore come to passe, because hee doth nor hinder it: and as no good thing can either bee or come to passe, vnlesse God make it: so no euill thing can be auoyded, except God doe hinder. And there is not the least thing which may bee done without this will; vnlesse we will say that Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is idle; which to say were wicked. The reasons of this our iudgement are many. The first reason I will draw out of most euident testimonies of Scripture. Act. 2. 23. <hi>Him I say being deliuered by the determinate counsell and foreknowledge of God, after you had taken, with wicked hands you haue crucified and slain.</hi> Act. 4. 27. 28. <hi>They gathered themselues together, to doe whatsoeuer thine hand and thy counsell had determined before to be done.</hi> Here it is to be obserued, that not only Christs passion but also the works which in respect of the Iewes were wicked, doe come vnder the decree and will of God: to wit, so far forth as God willed that they should come to passe for iust endes. This very thing <hi>Augustine</hi> signifieth when he saith,

The second reason follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: it is the common opinion of all men that God doth will to suffer sinne, but to will to suffer it, is to will not to hinder it, and to will not to conferre grace.

If you graunt the

first, I haue my desire. The second is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd; namely that God doth not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der euill, because hee doth vtterlie nill that it should bee done. For this is to make God inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stant. The third, <hi>Lumbard</hi> and the schoolemen affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me. For they say that God in respect of sinne hath no posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue act, neither of willing nor of nilling, but onely a negatiue act of not willing to hinder it. But by this meanes a great part of those things, which are done in the world should come to passe God being either ignorant or negligent. The very permission also is a certaine will and not a pure negation: for no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>to will to hinder, that is, to suffer, is indeed to will not to hinder. If thou wilt say the fourth, thou doest wickedly make an idle and Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish god, therefore wee must needs retire vnto the first, <hi>viz.</hi> that God' doth decree that euill should come to passe in such sort as I haue declared.

               <p>Thirdlie, we know that <hi>Adams</hi> reuol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is now past and done; therefore wee

I grant it, but not this onely. For the prouidence of God is ouer the world and euery thing therein: both in respect of the ende, as also of the beginning of euerie action: Sathan and the wicked doe not onely not finish, that which they would, but they doe not so much as begin it, vnlesse God willeth and giueth leaue.

The first is, that the obiect euen of mans will is good, and therefore much more of Gods will, and the obiect of the will cannot be euill by it selfe but by accident: for if the will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth euill, it willeth it not as it is euill, but as it is good. The second ground is, that there is a certaine <hi>summum bonum</hi> or so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne good with which there is no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill conioynd; because there is a certaine thing infinitely good, namely God: but there is not any absolute euill, because there is nothing so euill, but it hath some good ioyned therewith, and therefore it is good that sinne should be and come to

                     </gap>o is goodnesse it selfe.</hi> Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I answere: That sinne in the causes and circumstances thereof fully and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly weighed, is two waies to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. First we consider sinne not as it is sinne, but so farre foorth as it hath some respect vnto good with God which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeth it. And this way taking sinne, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God willeth it not simply and by it selfe, yet he decreeth it and willeth it as touching the euent. Moreouer sinne hath respect vnto God two manner of waies, first, because it is in that which is good: secondly, because it tendeth to that which is good. I say it is in that which is good; because euery euill is in that which is good as in the subiect. Now in respect of the subiect, that is, as sinne is a motion, an inclination, or an action, God both wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and effecteth the same. Moreouer sin


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3741:72"/>
tendeth to that which is good, because God ordaineth it to good, and from thence draweth the good either of triall, chastisement, or punishment. And we say that God is so farre foorth willing that sinne should come to passe, as hee is able and will by his wonderfull wisedome from thence to draw foorth that which is good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we consider sinne according <note place="margin">God did n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> vnto God.</note> to the propertie and naturall being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that is, sinne as it is sinne; And this way also we weigh sinne either so far forth as it is sinne in it selfe in regard of men, or as it is sinne to God. But God himselfe neither willeth, nor approueth, nor effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth sinne, as it is sinne in it selfe in regard of the creatures that offend; and yet hee willeth as touching the euent, not simplie, as those things that are good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but only by willing to permit that it may be. For there is a threefold action of Gods wil, the first is that whereby God willeth any thing by willing it, that is, when he willeth it with his whole and absolute will, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith, and this way he willeth that which is good in it


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3741:72"/>
selfe. The second action is that, whereby he nilleth any thing by nilling it, as that which shall neuer come to passe, because God doth vtterly nill the being thereof. The third and last action is remisse and in the middest betweene both, whereby hee willeth some thing by nilling it slackely or remissely, that is, when hee partly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it and partly nilleth it, or else so far forth wills it, as that for iust causes he nills it. And after this sorte wee say, that God willeth the euent of euill, as it is euill in it selfe in respect of men; because euill as it is euill after this sorte, is not absolutely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: and God draweth good out of euill as it is euill in the nature thereof or in it selfe: as hee brought forth light out of darkenesse, euen as it was darkenesse in it selfe. And if so be that euill were abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurely euill, as God is absolutely good, he would in no wise will the euent of euill, neither should there be any euill existent at all. For that which God vtterly nilleth, hath not any being or existence. But sin as it is sin to God, (now that is a sinne to God which is in it selfe sinne, in his decree whereby all things are ordained as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3741:73"/>
sinne) hee neither willeth it, nor approueth it, nor worketh it, no in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect he doth not so much as permit it. I doe not denie but that God permitteth and suffreth euill, as it is euill in it selfe, (otherwise there were not euill properly and naturally) but I denie that he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, because it is euill. For God neuer suffreth euill for it selfe, but for the good that is therewith conioyned. And this is the meaning of that saying of <hi>Beza: The Lord neuer permitteth sins, as they are sins,</hi>

In these and such like maner of speeches his purpose was, to ouerthrow the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Schoolemen, who would haue his permission seuered from his will: It were good therefore for them better to consider of the matter, who without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chatitie or humanitie doe with the blasphemies of the Manichees slaunder and bely this holy man.</p>
               <p>Secondly they vse to obiect, that God willeth things contrarie, if hee will that that should come to passe which hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth in his law. <hi>Answer.</hi> It is true indeed, if he should will one and the same thing to come to passe and not to come to passe in one and the same respect and manner: but God forbiddeth euill as it is euill, and willeth it to come to passe as it hath respect vnto good.

                  <hi>God willeth euill to be, and that God willeth euill not to be, are not contradictorily opposed, seeing both are affirmatiue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, they obiect thus: That thing which being graunted, another thing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarilie followeth, is the cause of that


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3741:74"/>
selfe same thing that doth follow; but this being granted that God willed the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> to come to passe, the same came to passe necessarily and infallibly. Therfore the will of God was in this respect the cause of sinne. Whereto I answere, that the first proposition of this argument is not generall, for in admitting the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, both the place and the time or continuance thereof are infallibly and without doubt also to bee admitted, and yet the creation of the world is not the cause of the continuance thereof, and of the place, where it now consisteth. And that this proposition may be true, it is thus to be framed: <hi>That thing which being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, another thing infallibly followeth (no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause comming betweene) is the cause of the very same thing that followeth.</hi> And the second proposition also sitted to this former is vntrue. For this being granted that God willeth sin to happen, sin shall not come to passe immediatly, but by the meanes of mans free wil; &amp; although it come to passe infallibly on Gods part which decreeth it, yet it comes to passe freely on mans part, for it had been possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3741:74"/>
for man not to haue sinned when hee did sinne if hee had would. As may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by this Similitude. God forsaketh man by not conserring and bestowing on him necessarie and sufficient helpe for the auoyding of sinnes; now man being forsaken by him, sinneth necessarily; And yet the fault is not to be laid on God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that in this his forsaking him the will of man commeth betweene. For God forsaketh man being willing to bee forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and not against his will and mind.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I answere to the aforesaid reproch of our doctrine, that wee say not, that sinne is from the decree, or of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, as from the efficient, materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, formall, or finall cause. But wee doe teach and au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rre that sinne commeth to passe according to the prouidence, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, as the sole consequent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For wee assuredly thinke and iudge that the decree of God doth so go before the sinne of man, as that it hath no respect vnto any cause, vnlesse it be of such a one, as is a failing and deficient cause. So saith <hi>Augustin: Therefore truely the great works</hi>

                  <hi>of the Lord are exquisite in all his wills, so that

               </p>
               <p>Againe it is obiected. He that saith that the decree of God is the energeticall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue beginning of all things, necessarilie maketh the decree of God, the beginning also of sinne. Whereunto I answer, That the holy Ghost himselfe saith that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God is the beginning of all things being and existent; Eph. I. cap. II. verse: <hi>God worketh all things after the counsell of his owne will.</hi> And againe in the 17. of the Acts, <hi>In him we liue, we moue, and haue our being.</hi> Augustine saith: <hi>The will of God is the very cause of all things which are.</hi> Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go <note place="margin">De gene, cont.

that God doth incline vnto sinne and that hee doth positiuely harden the heart. Whereto I answere, that wee allow not a bare permission seuered vtterly from his will, neither doe we atribute a positiue or naturall action vnto God, as though hee did infuse corruption and sinne: and yet we say that hee doth actiuely harden the heart. The action of Gods Prouidence (as saith <hi>Suidas)</hi> in the works of men is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. The first is according to his good pleasure, whereby God willeth any work, <note place="margin">

                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> God vpholdeth and maintaineth, the being, and all the faculties, motions, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and passions of nature which offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Act. 17. 28. <hi>In him we liue, and moue, and haue our being.</hi> And although God do sustaine nature offending, and the action of nature, yet is hee free from fault; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he vpholdeth the creature, onely as it is a creature, not as it is euill. For the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cause, as the will of man, can by it


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3741:76"/>
selfe doe euilly and corruptly: yet it can doe nothing by it selfe, vnlesse the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thereof bee reduced to the first cause. As may appeare more plainly by this si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude: A man doth hault by reason that his legge is out of ioynt: now heere are two things to be considered, the very walking or motion it selfe, and his haul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: the haulting proceedes onely from his legge out of ioynt, the walking both from his legge and also from the facultie of mouing. In like manner a man sinning, in that he doth it is of God, but in that he doth euilly, it is of himself. We must ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heere know that God doth vphold order as it is of nature, but furthereth not the will violently breaking out against the order of the morall law. The third <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> action of Gods prouidence is according vnto concession, whereby God in the euil worke of man worketh some things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily; and this last action is threefold. The first is permission: whereby God forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth especially the wicked by withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them his grace, and by leauing them according to their deserts vnto their owne wickednesse, which hee had before


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3741:77"/>
restrained, that it might not breake forth to so immoderate libertie. And wee vse commonly to say, that he which permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, doth and effecteth some thing: as when the rider giueth the reines vnto his wanton and sporting horse, wee say that hee doth moue and encourage him; and wee say that the hunter doth put his dog on the game, when as hee letteth him slip. The second action (as I may so terme it) is occasionall, whereby God by proffered occasions, in themselues good or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, outwardly draweth foorth, stirreth vp, and bringeth out sinne in those who of themselues openly runne into wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; to the intent that hee may either iustly punish their knowne impietie, or else discouer it being closely shrouded. The like haue wee ordinarily euen among our selues: for the Physitian by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruatiue medicine, stirreth vp, inflameth, and draweth foorth the humours out of the corruption of the bodie. Admit a house be weakely timbred, which being almost now already falne wilere lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g fall; and that I doe not with any engines or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments throw or beate down the same,


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3741:77"/>
but onely take away the outward hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances, and on euery side as it were open a way for the downfall, to the intent, that when it falleth, it may by the greater fall be broken in peeces. After this sort dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth God with the wicked: and hereupon is it that the law is said to stirre vp and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease sinne in <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. 8. This action is done many manner of waies, as when the hindrances of sinne are taken away: when as the way is opened to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of one especiall sinne, and not of another: when as obiects are offered, which the vngodly vse as instigations vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sinne. These obiects, are commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, threatnings, exhortations, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations either good or indifferent put by God in the mindes of vngodly men, from the which the wicked by reason of his wickednesse doth greedily take an occasion to doe ill. And this is the manner and way truly, whereby wee say that God stirreth man vnto euill, without infusing the least drop or iot of euill. For as in the middle region of the aire the heate grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth stronger by the antiperistasis or repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on euery part, from whence proceeds


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3741:78"/>
the thunder and lightning: and by the heate round incompassed, the clowdes are condensated and made thicke: euen so the wicked and vngodly when they are stirred vp by wholsome precepts, doe grow more vngodly: and euill doth so much the more begin to delight them, by how much the more they know that it is lesse lawfull for them: according to the saying of the Poet: <hi>Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimus<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     </expan> negara:</hi> We still ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour things forbid, and couet thats de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide. The third action is a disposing, whereby God through the euill worke of an euill instrument, finisheth his owne worke iustly and holily. As for example: The sale of <hi>Ioseph</hi> in his brethren was sin: the iust action of God in this euill worke was the foresending of <hi>Ioseph</hi> into Aegypt for the common good and benefit of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> familie. And from this disposing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedes it, that God vseth the sins of men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>olily, that hee prouoketh them holily, and ordreth them as the Physition for a medicine ordreth poyson, contrary to the nature thereof: that he ordreth them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily both according to the causes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings,


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:3741:78"/>

Thirdly I answere to the aforesaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch of this our doctrine, that wee doe vtterly abhorre and detest the Stoicall Fate, because it appointeth an inherent necessitie in things themselues, which should bind euen God himselfe, and all other things, and make them subiect ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto. For howsoeuer wee doe beleeue that the very decree of God is immutable and therefore necessarie, yet in God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe it was most free (for hee could either not haue decreed that which hee did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or else otherwise haue decreed it: I and he addeth to the second causes placed out of God a certaine necessitie, but yet so free a one, as that it is rather to be termed a libertie, then a necessitie. And this shall easily appeare to be as I say, if I shall first shew, what sortes of necessitie there bee, and how farre forth it is agreeable vnto thinges. First therefore, a thing is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry two waies, absolutely &amp; conditionally. That is obsolutely necessarie which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwise, or else whose contrarie is impossible, as that God is omnipotent and iust. And that is conditionally neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, which cannot be otherwise, but yet


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3741:80"/>
not simply, but by the granting of one or many things: and this kind of necessitie is either by nature, or the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or decree of God. That is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie by nature, which commeth to passe constantly and immutably by reason of that order which God hath set in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things: after this sort is it of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that fire doe burne, that the earth is carried downeward, and the heauen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. That is necessarie by commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is necessarily to be done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hath commanded it. After this fort it is of necessitie that one vndergoe the office of a magistrate. Rom. 13. 5. That is necessarie by the decree of God, which is so, because God hath foreknowne it, and willed either to effect it, or at the least to permit it. After this sort euery thing in respect of God is necessarie, and <hi>the will</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">De ciuit. Dei lib. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>of God</hi> (as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) <hi>is the necessitie of things.</hi> Secondly, necessitie is either of compulsion or infallibility. Necessitie of compulsion, is that which inferreth vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to things by some cause working without, and forciblie constraineth that they doe either this or that. And this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:3741:80"/>
is the Stoicall necessitie, that a man <note place="margin">Tull. de Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus.</note> should doe any thing against his will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compelled by force and necessitie. There is also such a like kind of necessitie of the Manichees, condemned by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who taught that there was no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or necessitie offred vnto the will by God, nor that it was forced by necessitie to sinne. The necessitie of infallibilitie is that whereby a thing according to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent shall certainly and immutably come to passe: yet so, as if we consider the cause of a thing by it selfe, it may either not come to passe, or else come otherwise to passe. Of this manner of necessitie wee must vnderstand that principle: Euerie thing that is, when it is, is of necessity. And thus is necessitie distinguished: now will I shew how farre forth it is agreeable to seuerall things. The euents of all things haue reference either to the second causes, or to God, who is the first cause. Now some things in respect of the second cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are necessary, othersome contingent. From causes which are necessarie, must needs proceede that which is necessarie, from those that are free, that which is free,


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3741:81"/>
from those that are naturall that which is naturall; and to bee briefe, such as are the next causes aforegoing, such also is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent of things. But in respect of God, all things whatsoeuer, are partly changeable, and partly necessarie. In respect of Gods libertie, which doth that which it doth freely, all things are contingent and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: howsoeuer according to nature and the order of the next causes, they be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie and immutable. In respect of Gods decree, the second causes and the effects of them are all necessarie, howsoeuer in themselues they bee vncertaine and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>nt. And yet they are not absolutelie necessarie, but by the supposition of Gods decree, neither are they necessarie by the necessitie of compulsion, but of infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie only, because God ordained before that those things which should come to passe should be. And this kind of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie taketh not away the contingencie and libertie of second causes, but rather establisheth and confirmeth it. For that which is free worketh freely, and that which is contingent, worketh contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, by the necessarie decree of God.


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:3741:81"/>
Neither doth libertie and necessitie mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ouerthrow each other, but libertie and compulsion. It is manifest therefore that Gods decree causeth an immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to all things, of which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding some, in respect of the next causes, are necessarie, and othersome contingent; but all of them in respect of Gods liberty mutable. And as the mutabilitie which thinges haue from Gods power, taketh not away the necessitie which they haue from the second causes: so the necessitie of immutabilitie by Gods decree conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently comming to passe, taketh not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the contingencie which they haue from the next causes and Gods libertie. Moreouer wee say, that Gods decree or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth the second causes, and the verie libertie it selfe also of mans will, not by compulsion, as if a man should violently throw a stone, but by inclining and gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie bending them, by obiects outwardlie offred to the vnderstanding (euen as a sheepe is said to be drawne, when grasse is shewed her being an hungry) that a man <note place="margin">August. de verb. Apost. ser. 2.</note> may choose by his owne free motion, or


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3741:82"/>
refuse that which God hath iustly decreed from all eternitie.</p>
               <p>These things being granted, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest also what we ought to thinke concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> Which truely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the euent is necessarie by the necessitie of infallibilitie by reason of the forcknowledge and decree of God: yet so as that God is not guiltie of any fault; because the decree of God howsoeuer it was necessarie in it selfe, yet it planted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby he should fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sinne, but left him to his owne libertie, not hindring his fall when it might; and the same fall in respect of mans wil (which doth that freely that it doth) came to passe contingently and most freely. But, you will say, that <hi>Adam</hi> could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand Gods will, that is, his decree; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I answere, that euen as he could not, so also hee would not. But, you will say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine he could not will otherwise. Which I confesse to bee true, as touching the act and euent, but not as touching the very power of his will, which was not compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but of the owne free motion consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3741:82"/>
vnto the suggestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the diuell. But to the intent that these things may more plainely bee vnderstood, wee must make distinction betweene three times, the time going before his fall, the present time of his fall, and the time after his fall. In the first moment of time the fal of <hi>Adam</hi> was necessarie in a double respect: First, by reason of the foreknowledge of God: for that which he foreknew would come to passe, must needes of necessitie come to passe. Secondly, by reason of the permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue decree of God, that fal was according to the euent necessarie immutably. <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius Augustodunensis</hi> saith, <hi>It cannot other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi>

                     </gap>e but that al things must come to passe, which God hath predestinated &amp; foreknowne, seeing that hee onely either doth all things or permitteth them to be done.</hi> Hugo de S. vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctore saith: <hi>Sinne followeth of necessitie by</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Quaest. in Rom. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>the withdrawing of grace.</hi> And the reason hereof is very easie, because euill permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted must come to passe, and cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise come to passe than God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth. For to permit euill, is not to stirre vp the will, and not to bestow on him that is tempted the act of resisting, but to leaue


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3741:83"/>
him as it were to himselfe: and he whose will is not stirred vp by God, and to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the act of resisting is not conferred, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he may haue power to withstand: yet can he not actually will to withstand, nor persist for euer in that vprightnesse wherein hee was created, God denying him strength. I confesse truly that this kinde of necessitie as touching the liberty of mans will, was altogether euitable and to be auoided: and yet according to the euent of the action it was ineuitable. Yet I would not that any man should thinke that this necessitie did any way proceede from the decree of God, which did onely follow the decree being granted and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and <hi>Adam</hi> in his temptation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing destitute of the helpe of God, cast himselfe of his own accord into this same ensuing necessitie of sinning. In the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, his fall being present, there was another necessitie thereof: because when it was it was of necessitie. In the third time, man drew vnto himselfe by his fault, his nature being now corrupted, another necessitie of sinning, insomuch that he made himselfe the seruant of sin.

For the first act thereof, which is a purpose not to shew mercie, causeth not this necessitie in men, but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before it as an antecedent: and man himselfe verily hath brought vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe this necessitie with his owne most free, yet rebelling will. Now the second act of Reprobation, which is a purpose of


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:3741:84"/>
condemning, causeth not any necessitie of damnation, but by the sinne of man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming betweene. Moreouer, the necessitie of damnation followeth after the same manner by the foreknowledge of God: and yet this neuer seemed a thing strange vnto any one. But some will say, that the foreknowledge of God doth neuer cause in men any necessitie of damnation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it doe assuredly foresee the same. And I say also, that Reprobation doth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not at all cause damnation in man, or that it doth not cause it, but for sinne. But it may be obiected: They that are prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated vnto damnation, cannot be freed by repentance, although they would.

                  </gap>ages of the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees. For we differ from them as much in certaine iudgement &amp; opinion, as who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer doe differ most. For first, the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ickes doe tie God vnto the second causes, so that he cannot doe otherwise, then the nature of them will suffer: wee on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, doe hold that all second causes do depend vpon and are ordered by God. Secondly, the Stoickes say, that neither God nor second causes can doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by their nature than they doe: wee say that some second causes, are by Gods


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3741:85"/>
ordinance mutable, othersome immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and that God himselfe, can either not doe, that which hee doth, or else doe it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. But now to come to the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees, who make two coeternall gods; we but one. They of their two Gods, make one good, and another euill: we say, that there is one absolutely good &amp; iust God. Thirdly, they wil haue one of their Gods to bee the cause and worker of good things, and the other of euil: we make one true God the creatour and ruler of all things, and working nothing but that which is most good and most iust. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they say that they which are created by their good God cannot sinne: we say, that God doth most freely conuert whom hee will, and when they are conuerted, they can neuer in this life perfectly be free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinnes, but doe sometimes run into such sinnes, as doe grieuously wound the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Fiftly, they say, that they that are created by the euil God simply cannot be conuerted: wee say, that vncleane spirites and men were created both good and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but yet they fell by their owne will and fault, and not by any fault but the iust


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3741:85"/>
permission of the Creatour, and brought vpon themselues a necessitie of sinning. And although it be true, that man cannot withhold himselfe from sinning, vnlesse God giue him that grace, yet doth he not sin of necessitie, that is, of compulsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but willingly. And the will hath sufficient li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie if by it selfe or the nature therof it be inclinable to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary of that which it chooseth, and doth of the owne accord choose that which it chooseth; although the same liberty bee gouerned and one way limited by God. Wherefore I am flat of <hi>Anselmus</hi> opinion, who saith: <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cor. grat. &amp; lib. arbitr.</note> 
                  <hi>it bee of necessity that those things do come to passe which are foreknowne and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated; yet some things foreknowne and predestinated doe not come to passe by that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie which goeth before a thing, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth is, but by the same necessitie which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth a thing. For God doth not cause, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he doth praedestinate them, by forcing the will, as by resisting it, but by leauing them in the power thereof.</hi> And I am also of <hi>Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentius</hi> his opinion; who saith: <hi>The Iewes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ser. 3. ad Neophy.</note> 
                  <hi>were willing to doe that euill which they did. And verily, if they had bin vnwilling to doe it


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3741:86"/>
they had not done it. And it is a grosse sinne, but to thinke that God, who is not onely good and righteous, but also goodnesse and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse it selfe, doth either command, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel any thing to be done, which he condemneth when it is done.</hi> But that I may in a word fully deliuer my opinion, if it bee deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, how the will of God carrieth it selfe to good or euill, I answere: that in a good act God carrieth himselfe positiuely. For first he determineth the euent of good, by willing effectually to worke it; and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, hee inwardly inclineth the will of the creature, to doe that good which it doth. Thirdly, he sometimes laieth a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of immutabilitie on him that doth well, but yet it is ioyned with an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding freedome. After this sort the elect Angels doe necessarily obey God, yet not by constraint, but greatly coueting, and with all the strength of their will desiring it, not being thereunto compelled. In an euill act, I say that God carrieth himselfe priuatiuely; not by a logical, but a natural priuation foregoing the habit. For first he willeth that euill come to passe, not by doing it himselfe, but by willing not to


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3741:86"/>
hinder it to be done by others. Secondly, he doth not inwardly incline the will to doe euill, but he forsaketh, and outwardly offereth obiects which are good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Thirdly, God laieth not on vs any necessitie, but a desertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or want of grace, to which being imposed, followeth the necessitie of sinning, not as the effect doth his cause, but as the defect doth him that forsaketh. And this I am resolued on, that Gods decree doth altogether order euery euent, partly by inclining and gently bending the will in all things y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are good; and partly by forsaking it in things that are euill: and yet the will of the creature left vnto it selfe, is carried headlong of the owne accord, not of necessitie in it selfe, but contingently that way which the decree of God determined from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. We therefore (thankes be giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God) doe with all our hearts renounce the doting follies of the Stoickes and the Manichees.</p>

               <p>It might happily seeme a rigorous course that some should bee depriued of Christ, if so bee that they had neuer at any time nor any where receiued sauing grace. But all and euery one receiued ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and happinesse in <hi>Adam,</hi> together with abilitie to perseuere and remaine in the some holy and happie estate, if they had would. But <hi>Adam</hi> would not; but did of his owne accord cast away that grace which was bestowed on him by his Creator: for which being lost, it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that all without exception are not damned. And therefore it may seeme the lesse strange to any one, if grace by Christ bee againe bestowed vpon one, and not vpon another.</p>
               <p>Secondly I answere, that wee doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge with glad mindes that Christ died for all (the scripture auerring so much): but we vtterly deny, that he died for <hi>all and euer one alike in respect of God,</hi> or, as well for the damned as elect, and that effectually on Gods part. For first let vs weigh well the words of Christ: <hi>I neuer knew you: depart from me yee workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</hi>

Now to know with God is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge; and therefore, whom Christ neuer knew, hee neuer acknowledged for his. And those whom he hath not some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time acknowledged, he neuer bought or redeemed with the price of his bloud. And therefore well saith <hi>Gregorie: Not to know with God is to reiect.</hi> Againe, if al and euery one be effectually redeemed, al and euery one are reconciled vnto God.

And hereby it is most manifest, that all the like places of Scripture, which many doe think to make for the vniuersall redemption of all and euery one, are to be vnderstood of some men to be called but of euery nation and countrie after the death of Christ.

                  <note place="margin">Euchir. ad. Laur. c. 103</note> 
                  <hi>haue all men to be saued, is so said, not because there is no man whom hee would haue dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who would not doe any powerfull mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles among them, who hee saith would haue repented if hee had: but that wee by all men, may vnderstand euery sort of men, by what differences so euer distinguished, whether they be Kings or subiects, noble or ignoble, high or low, learned or vnlearned, strong or weake, witty, dull spirited or foolish, rich, poore or

meane men or women, infants or children, youths or yong men, middle aged men or old men, in all languages, in all trades, in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, in all professions, in the innumerable variety of wills and consciences, and what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther differences soeuer there is among men.</hi> These things saith hee, very truely and rightly, for this word, All, is sometime ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken distributiuely, and then it signifieth euery seuerall and particular person: and <hi>Paul</hi> to the entent that hee might signifie <note place="margin">2.

The <note place="margin">Matth. 9. 35</note> double signification of this word <hi>Aristotle</hi> also obserued. This word All (saith he) is <note place="margin">Pol. lib. 2. cap. 2.</note> taken two waies, first for euery one—and secondly the word Al is vsed, when it doth not signifie euery one: It is plaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the word All hath a doubtfull <note place="margin">

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3741:93"/>
which speaketh it, then is not that true which he speaketh, namely that euery man is a lier. But, if this saying be true, these words Euerie man doth lye, are (as I saide before) to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood after this sort, A great part of men are liers. And the Apostle writeth elsewhere, Teaching euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and again, Admonishing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Comment. ad Rom. c. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>euery man: not that he taught all men, (for how many are there yet at this day which haue neither heard of the Apostles doctrine,</hi> nor yet so much as his name?) <hi>but that</hi> hee should teach and admonish all that are in the Church. <hi>Sedulius</hi> also saith: <hi>Many</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In epist. ad Rom. 6. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and all in Paul are one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh in this place according to the charitable iudgement of Christians: and not according to the iudgement of secret and infallible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie. Like vnto this, is that also that he calleth the faithfull in seuerall Churches men elected; amongst whom there were many which afterward fell away from the faith. And yet is not the Apostle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued; for it is one thing to speake, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his owne affection: and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to speake, as the matter is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is indeede. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith:


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:3741:94"/>
                  <hi>We ought so charitably to be affected, as to</hi>

                  <hi>wish that all men be saued: as men that know not who appertaine to the number of those that are predestinated, and who doe not.</hi> And againe: <hi>We must as much as in vs hath,</hi>

                  <hi>being vnable to distinguish those that are predestinated, from those that are not, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that all men be saued, and vse sharpe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection vnto all with an entent to heale them that they perish not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it appeareth what we ought to thinke of <hi>Damascene</hi> his opinion, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth the will of God into his precedent and consequent will. He calleth that his precedent will, whereby God, as he that is absolutely good, willeth to bestow all good things, yea blessednes it selfe vpon the creature; and by this will hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that God willeth that all men should bee saued, and attaine vnto his kingdome: because hee made vs not to punish vs, but that he might make vs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his goodnesse, as being good himselfe. But his consequent will is that, whereby for some certaine circumstances of the creature, he absolutely willeth this or that: and by this will, hee saith, that


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3741:94"/>
God willeth that man should be damned for sinne, because he is inst. And indeede this distinction in it selfe is to be allowed, but that is not a very fit example, which hee hath set downe or alleaged, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his precedent will. For there seemeth not to bee in God such a will, or (as they <note place="margin">Optatiua voluntar.</note> vse to terme it) such a <hi>wishing will,</hi> whereby he will indefinitely and vpon condition, that all and euery man of all ages should bee saued. For first, it argueth a finite po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and insufficiencie in him that willeth. For whatsoeuer any one desireth and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly willeth, that will be bring to passe, vnlesse hee be hindred. As for example: The Merchant desireth and earnestly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to saue his ware: but being forced by a tempest, to the entent that himselfe may escape, hee doth absolutely will to cast them into the sea. Yea indeede this kinde of will seemeth to argue weaknes, because God willeth that, which shall not come to passe. But you will say, that this will is conditionall; that is, that God will that they be saued, if they shall beleeue. And I say first, that the will of God stands doubtfull, vntill the condition bee fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3741:95"/>
&amp; that the first cause is by this meanes held in suspence by the second causes: moreouer there is giuen vnto men a free will either to beleeue or not to beleeue: that is, flexible and inclinable both waies, either by grace, or by nature: both which things are false, as I will afterwards shew. And therfore, this will is rather a humane will than a diuine. Heare what <hi>Anselmus</hi> saith: <hi>The will of God is taken foure manner of waies by the principall Doctors: first, for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lib. de vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt. Dei.</note> 
                  <hi>the knowlddge of God: then for the will of the Saints, who will in charitie that euen the vniust should be saued: againe, for humane reason: and lastly for Gods Commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.</hi> Secondly, this conditionall will seemeth idle and vnnecessarie, especially in him whose power is infinite; because if hee earnestly willed, hee would verily doe a thing, when he might without hindrance. Thirdly, Gods wil is not such concerning the Angels, whereby he willeth that all of them should be saued: therefore, it may well bee demanded, whether his will bee such concerning man. Fourthly, if God will that all men, as they are men, bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: in like manner hee will that all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:3741:95"/>
as they are sinners, be damned; which is absurd. Fiftly, that will which cannot bee resisted, is absolute: but Gods Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent or first will cannot bee resisted: Rom. 9. 19. For there <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of the will that goeth before all causes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the precedent will is absolute. And this will I make manifest after another manner: the will of God is that some should beleeue and perseuere, and that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersome should bee forsaken either not beleeuing or not perseuering. You will aske me happely how I know this. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, by the euent. For as touching the euent some beleeue, and some doe not beleeue. But to beleeue and to perseuere is a certaine kind of good action; and on the contrarie not to beleeue, or not to perseuere is an euill action. And euery thing that is good, is, through the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall will of God; and so farre foorth as there is, or existeth that which is good, so farre foorth God willeth it, and maketh it to exist by willing it. And that euill, which commeth to passe, commeth to passe, God not hindring it; and because God will not hinder it, therefore conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:3741:96"/>
it commeth to passe. Hereupon, it is certaine, that God willeth that some should beleeue, and perseuere vnto the end, and that othersome doe not so; yea euen without any condition: and no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can be rendred, wherefore he willeth this. Therefore this will is both absolute and first: and therefore that vniuersall precedent will concerning the saluation of all and euery one in Christ, is counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feite and fained. Sixtly, the ground of this opinion, is that foresaid place of <hi>Paul,</hi> which I haue alreadie shewed to be misunderstood. And yet, that place laieth not down vnto vs any conditional but an absolute will. For there it is first affirmed, that <hi>God will haue all men to be saued:</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that <hi>he will haue all men to come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> that is, vnto faith, because by applying faith to the word of God we acknowledge the truth. Where is now the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that condition of faith? Lastly, against <hi>Damascene</hi> I oppose <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine:</hi> who to the Pelagians vrging this <note place="margin">Hypog. lib. 6 cap. 8.</note> place of scripture, God will that all men be saued, maketh a double answere: first hee denieth that it is not generally to bee


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:3741:96"/>
vnderstood of the vniuersalitie of men, and that by this argument: That which God willeth he effecteth: but hee doth not generally saue all men; therefore hee willeth not. Secondly, hee faith that the place is to be vnderstood of them which are actually saued: because all men which are saued, are saued by the will of God. Againe, I oppose against him <hi>Prosper</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, who saith: <hi>If the will of God concerning</hi>

But are there not many who would be saued, and yet are not saued?—or thus, he offereth grace vnto all, by which, if they will, they may bee saued.

               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect. III.</hi> That which euery one is bound to beleeue is true: but euery one is bound to beleeue that he is effectuallie redeemed by Christ: therefore it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest that euery one euen the reprobate is effectually redeemed by the death of Christ. Whereto I answere: that the <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini</hi> or parts of the proposition are to be distinguished: that which euery one is bound to beleeue, is true according to the intention of God that bindeth: but it is not alwaies true according to the euent. <hi>Ionas</hi> preached, and therefore hee was bound to beleeue, <hi>Yet fortie daies, and Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiue shall bee destroyed:</hi> but this was not


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3741:97"/>
true according to the euent. The assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion also must bee distinguished. Euerie one in the Church, by Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (Beleeue the Gospell) is bound to beleeue that he is redeemed by Christ: yea euen the reprobate as well as the elect, but yet notwithstanding in a diuers and different respect. The elect is bound to beleeue that by beleeuing hee shall bee made partaker of election: the Reprobate, that by not beleeuing hee may bee made vnexcusable, euen by the intention of God. For God sometimes giueth a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement not that it should be actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly done, but that men may bee tried, that they performe outward discipline, and that they may be conuicted of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall infidelitie, and bee made vnexcusable of all their sinnes before God in the last iudgement. For thus I distinguish of Gods commaundement: there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine commaundement of obedience, the performance whereof God willeth in all: hither are referred the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the morall law. There is also a certaine commaundement of triall, as the commaundement of sacrifysing <hi>Isaac:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 22. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </note>


                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:3741:98"/>
whereas God willeth not the act it selfe, but onlie the manifestation of obedience. And therefore God must not bee said to mocke men, if by the word preached hee doe outwardly call those, whom hee will not haue to be saued: for by this meanes hee sheweth vnto them the riches of his grace, and declareth that they perish by their owne fault, because they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue saluation offered. But you will say they cannot: I confesse as much, but that inabilitie whereby they cannot, is volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, and borne together with vs, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused into vs by God: and therefore it cannot be excused. Very well therefore saith <hi>Bernard: The master knew well, that the weightinesse of the commandement exceeded</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ser. 40. in Cant.</note>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:3741:98"/>
is true, vnlesse any one shall by his owne vnbeleefe hinder himselfe; this doth the reprobate by his owne inborne infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Thirdly I answer, that the argument doth follow twice affirmatiuely in both propositions. For the termini or parts of the proposition are thus to bee turned: That is true, that euery one is bound to beleeue, but euery one is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he is redeemed by Christ. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that is true.</p>

               <p>And thus much for the efficacie and greatnesse of Christs death: Now as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning grace: I say, that that is diuerslie distinguished. For first, it is either restray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or renewing. The restrayning grace is that, whereby the inbred corruption of the hart, is not therby vtterly diminished and taken away, but in some is restrained more, in some lesse, that it breake not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently


<pb n="107" facs="tcp:3741:99"/>
forth into action: and it is giuen onely for a testimonie vnto man, and to preserue order amongst men in a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique societie: and this kind of grace is generall, that is, belonging to all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man, amongst whome some doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed othersome in the giftes of ciuill vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: and there is no man, in whom God doth not more or lesse restraine his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall corruption. Now renewing or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian grace (as auncient writers doe vsual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie call it) is that whereby man hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er giuen him to beleeue and repent, both in respect of will, and power: and it is vniuersall in respect of those that beleeue, but indefinit in respect of all and euerie man. Thus we teach, thus we beleeue.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Grace is either naturall, or <note place="margin">De praed. sanct. cap. 5.</note> supernatural: as <hi>Augustine</hi> himselfe teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Naturall grace is that, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on man together with nature: and this is either of nature perfect or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.

But that Grace which is supernaturall, is not due vnto nature, especially vnto nature corrupted, but is <hi>bestowed by speciall</hi> grace, and therefore is speciall. This the ancient writers affirme. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith: <hi>Nature is common to al, but not grace:</hi> and he only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth <note place="margin">De verb, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post. ser. 11.</note> a twofold grace; namely that common grace of nature, wherby we are made men: and Christian grace, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in Christ we are againe borne new me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

But they are not in this number vnto whom hee hath spoken in his disciples, and by his disciples, which he also now doth. For he came vnto the Gentils by his Church,—It remaines for vs to demaund, whether they can haue this excuse, which haue bin or are preuented by death, before Christ came in his Church to the gentiles, and before they heard his Gospell.

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>en: and to this end, I doe thus briefly propound it.</p>
               <p>First, God created all and euery man in <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> to eternall life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he foresav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the fall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, because he is by nature gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and good, he doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eriooshe will that all men after the fall should be saued, and come to the knowledge of the truth: and therefore willeth to giue all the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ances both of nature and grace that they may be saued; but yet indefinitely, if they themselues shall beleeue. This will of God (they say) is predes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ination, and the same with the writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gospell: The rule of this wil is; <hi>Whosoeuer shal beleeue shal be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; He that wil not beleeus shall be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:3741:103"/>
Lastly, Election is according to the foreknowledge of future faith, (which notwithstanding may be lost vtterly for a time, as some say; or finallie and for euer, as some others will) and reprobation is according to the foreknowledge of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie, or the contempt of the Gospel.</p>
               <p>This platforme is in very truth (so far as, I can iudge of is by the scriptures) a meere inuention of mans wit: which will appeare by the manifold errours therein contained.</p>
               <p>First, by this platforme or groundwork <note place="margin">Error 1.</note> there followeth a certaine vniuersall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and that a very absurd and strange one. For if there bee (as they doe affirme) an vniuerfall election, whereby God willeth that all men shall be saued in definitely, if they doe beleeue: he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth also by the like reason that all and each one should be da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned if they do not beleeue. But this reprobation is no where to be found in the scriptures. Yea hence refolloweth that God being alike affected to all, and seriously willing the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and saluation of all, doth neither chuse nor refuse any man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:3741:103"/>
From hence also it followeth, that God <note place="margin">Error 2.</note> hath in vaine propounded with himselfe the supreme &amp; absolute end of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, which is to communicate his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in true selicitie euen to enery man. For if we consider the cuent, he doth not communicate his goodnesse and eternall life vnto very many, which is otherwise than he purposed, namely vnto those that are damned. But we are in no case to say that the supreme end of Gods counsels, either haue an vncertaine euent, or are in vaine propounded.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this platforme attributed vnto God a certaine ordered and fitted will, <note place="margin">Error 3.</note> which doth wholy depend on mans will. Thou saist that God willeth that all men whatsoeuer should bee saued by Christ. Very well: Tell me therefore why they are not saued. They themselues will not, thou first. Yea wis. What is this but to set the creature in the throne of almightie God the Creator, against the order of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and of all causes? For the first cause, which indeede is Gods will, ought to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and dispose the act of the second cause. And therefore wee must not giue


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3741:104"/>
vnto God a will that is ordered by the will of the creature; especially conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that all order in heauen and in earth whatsoeuer proceedeth from him. That which ordereth all things, is ordered of none. Moreouer, men after this sort are elected of themselues, by receiuing of Gods grace being offied, by the assistance of common grace: and are also reiected of themselues by refusing of grace offred: and men themselues shall be the makers and framers of their owne election and reprobation: and God who chuseth is not so much to be praised, as the men that do receiue and embrace the blessing offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this platforme laies downe a determinate spreknowledge about the <note place="margin">Error 4.</note> euill of fault, without any decree going before concerning the euent of the fault; which cannot be. A definite foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is not the cause of that thing which is to be, but the thing which shal be is the cause of the foreknowledge thereof. For the thing which shall be followes not the foreknowledge of it, but foreknowledge followeth the thing which shall be, as <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinus</hi>


                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:3741:104"/>
taught. For God doth first decree a <note place="margin">Quaest. 58. Orthodox.</note> thing as touching the euent: then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hee doth foreknew by his definite foreknowledge that it shall be. And <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selme: In that</hi> (saith he) <hi>a thing is said to be foreknowne, it is by that pronounced that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Depraed. sanct. c. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>it shall be.</hi> And <hi>Augustine</hi> before his time affirmed, <hi>That God doth foreknow that which shall be.</hi> Hence it followeth that a thing must oxist with God, before it can be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely and definitly knowne before. And euery thing existeth and is, because God did will and decree to doe it if it be good, or to suffer it to be done if it be euill; haue respect alwaies to the good that is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with it. Vnlesse wee shall hold and grant this, it will follow that something hath being of it selfe, that is, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is a God. Therefore the existencie or being of things doth not goe before, but out of all doubt followes the decree of God. For first of al, there is a foteknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or (as it pleaseth others) a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">Scientia in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitiua.</note> of beholding, whereby God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth and seeth what is possible to bee, and what not: Then followeth the decree either of Gods operation, or of his volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3741:105"/>

               <p>The fifth desect in this platforme is, that it teacheth that Christ for his part <note place="margin">Error 5.</note> hath redeemed and reconciled all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man to God, and that very many of them for all that as touching the euent are damned, which is very absurd.

Moreouer if the first grace bee vniuersall, it is either faith actually or in power. For without faith it is impossible to please God, and to attaine saluation.

                  <hi>Ghost qualifies the temptations of the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie by dispensation, that those which may be may but scorch with their heate, and not burne vp with their fire.</hi> Hence I thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Whatsoeuer wee aske according to Gods will, it shall be giuen vs: but wee aske according to Gods wil, that we may not be vtterly forsaken in temptation: for our Aduocate taught vs so to pray. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that wee bee not vtterly forsaken in temptation, shall be giuen of God. Now whom God doth not vtterly forsake, he doth not vtterly fall away. And this Christ taketh for granted in the elect: Matth. 24. vers. 24. <hi>So as that, if it were possible, they should deceiue the very elect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Third reason: If there be a totall or vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter falling away from a true faith, then is there also required a second ingrasting into Christ, and consequently a seale of the second ingrafting, baptizing anew, that is to say, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>carnall generation is one, neither can a man enter into the wombe againe: euen so is spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall regeneration: for we are once borne, and we are also once borne againe. Therefore also it is requisite, that the sacrament of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation bee once receiued. If it chance to fall out by sinne, that some are weakened who are regenerated, they haue neede of cure by repentance, and not by baptisme.</hi> But those that doe vtterly or wholly fall away from faith and grace, are the second time to be ingrafted into Christ: and consequently, they are not once regenerated but again: and therefore they are oftner than once to be baptized.</p>
               <p>Fourth reason: 1 Ioh. 3. 9. <hi>Whosoeuer is borne of God committeth not sinne, because his seede remaineth in him.</hi> We must here marke that he saith his seede remaineth in him, that is to say, that it doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part nor vanish away; And this seede is the very word of God, which remaineth in vs by saith, and doth not remaine, saith being vtterly lost. This seede also is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, because it will neuer perish, if it be truly sowne in our hearts.</p>

                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:3741:119"/>
A fist reason is taken out of the sixt to the Romans, <note n="*" place="margin">Propositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> If Christ hauing once di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cannot die any more, then wee which are his members being dead together with him, shall not die any more in sinne. <note n="*" place="margin">Assumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> But Christ hauing once died cannot die any more. <note n="*" place="margin">Conclusion</note> Therefore we which are his members shall not die any more in sinne. The proposition is in the eight verse: and hath a manifest ground. For by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the mysticall communion, which is had with Christ by faith, his spirituall life, which cannot perish, flowing into his members, maketh them in like manner that they die no more in sinne. The As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption is in the 9. and 10. verse; the conclusion in the eleuenth. Moreouer, those which are the members of Christs bodie, shall grow vp vnto a perfect man: Eph: 4. 12. 13. and 1. Ioh. 2. 29. but all those which haue a true faith, are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christs bodie, therefore those which haue a true sauing faith shall grow vp vnto a perfect man: and therefore those which doe truely beleeue shall not perish but obtaine saluation.</p>
               <p>For the better vnderstanding of this


<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3741:119"/>
doctrine, two things must be sought for; first, whence it is that faith perisheth not? Answer: If wee consider faith by it selfe, that is, in the owne nature, it may perish and be lost; but if we consider the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming grace, which God hath promised to them that bleeue, sauing faith doth not perish. It is by reason of the second grace freely promised, that the first grace doth not perish. <hi>To you it is giuen for Christ,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>that ye should not onely beleeue in him, but also suffer for his sake.</hi> One of these (saith <hi>Augustine)</hi> belongs vnto the beginning, the other to the ende: but both are Gods gift, because both are giuen. A Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an mans beginning is to beleeue in Christ, and the best end hee can make is to suffer for Christ. Ier. 32. 40. <hi>I will make an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting couenant with them, that I will neuer depart from them, to doe them good</hi> (loe the euerlasting forgiuenesse of sinnes) <hi>and I will put my feare in their harts, that they shall not depart from mee</hi> (behold the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance of faith, and regeneration that shall neuer be lost) Phil. 1, 6. <hi>He that hath begun this good worke in you will finish it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end.</hi>

<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3741:123"/>
or full will. And I lay this foundation of this our iudgement. In tentation we must consider two things, the beginning or ground, and the degrees. The ground is our owne concupiscence, that is, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred corruption. The subiect thereof is the whole man, but especially the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mans soule, the mind, will, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. And in these it doth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly exist and reigne alone before a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner bee conuerted. And a man being not regenerated, be he what he will be, he is flesh euery iot of him. But after that a man is regenerated, the flesh is no more alone, or seuered by it selfe, but mixed with the spirit, and the spirit with the flesh: although both these qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine as touching nature distinct in one subiect: as in the twilight the light doth not appeare alone, but with darkenesse, and darkenesse is not alone but with the light. And the man that is regenerated is not onely flesh, nor onely spirit, nor flesh in one part, and spirit in another, but the whole man is flesh in euery part, and the whole man is spirit in euery part. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those things which are contrarie


<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3741:124"/>
cannot consist together in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, therefore albeit the whole man bee flesh, yet he is not flesh in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, nor spirit in the highest degree: but in remisse and lower degrees, partly flesh, and partly spirit: as luke-warme water is remissely and indifferentlie colde tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout, and remissely also hot tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout. Hence it followeth that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence may exist and bee with the grace of the holy spirit, so that it beare not rule. The degrees of tentation are, as <hi>Iames</hi> teacheth, in number sine. <note place="margin">Iam. cap. 1. 14. 15. <gap reason="foreign">

There is indeed in the vnregenerate in whom sinne reigneth, a full consent: but in the regenerate, in whom the flesh and the spirit are two contrarie foundations of actions, the consent is more remisse and vnperfect: for they doe so will, as that they nill, and so nill as that they will.

And it is like a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den legge fastned to the bodie by art. A true member is either by destination and appointment, or now actually one. Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by appointment are all those who are elected, although they be not as yet regenerated or borne. An actuall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is either one that is liuely, or halfe dead.

Thirdly, he which is a liuely and actiue member of Christ and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth, cannot be the member of an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot: but a member that is crazie and halfe dead may be. For howsoeuer he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in Christ in respect of incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and the mysticall vnion, yet hee is out of him as touching the force and efficacie of the spirit, which for a time through his owne default hee doth not perceiue, vntill he doe repent.

Preuenting grace is that, whereby God inspireth into <note place="margin">Praeueniens.</note> the mind of the sinner that is to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted good thoughts, a good purpose, and a desire of supernaturall grace. The meanes whereby preuenting grace is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, is the voyce and preaching of the


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:3741:128"/>
Gospell, by the which being heard and thought vpon, the holy Ghost doth shew forth his efficacie and power. For hence it is that the Gospell is called the <hi>ministerie of the spirit,</hi> 2.

Preparing grace is that, <note place="margin">Praeparans.</note> whereby it is giuen vs to consent vnto God offring grace, or whereby the mind and wil are prepared, that they may yeeld assent and obedience to the holy spirit. For as all supernaturall grace in respect of Gods donation, is altogether from him: euen so wee obtaine our consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and power to receiue grace confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red no otherwise then by the gift of God.

And without this grace following, the first is vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.

For when grace is giuen by God, and receiued of vs by the second grace, wee doe not vse it lawfully, but by this third grace. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith well: <hi>If in so great weakenesse of this life the will</hi>

               <p>Tenthlie, this platforme disagreeth with it selfe.

But I say, and that out of this plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, that God is wanting to some of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors; because he giueth them onlie a power to perseuere in faith if they will: or (if you had rather) a power to will to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuere; <note place="margin">Posse velle perseuerare.</note> and maketh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to perseuere actually and indeed. And vnlesse this grace be giuen, it is not possible, that anie should obtaine saluation by perseuering. For it is a most sure rule: A man doth not that good thing, which by grace he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for to doe, vnlesse God make him to doe it, as he hath made him able to doe it if hee will. Therefore hee, to whom the verie act of perseuerance is not giuen, being smitten with the violence of some grieuous temptation, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay

               <p>Lastly, this hypothesis or platforme is <note place="margin">Error 11.</note> but the varnishing and fresh trimming o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of certain opinions, which the Church in former ages did condemne.

Let vs gather that which is here mens by vsing a similitude; as for example: If any embassadour or priest purposing to make intercession for a citie ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by warre, shall bestow a very great ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and set free from his seruitude who is the chiefe Commander, all the multitude which is in captiuitie, in so much that they are altogether deliuered from all constraint on necessitie of bondage: and then if happily either their vsuall delight, or some soothing slaue, shall so instantly vrge some of the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,

and that God did foreknow before the creation of the world, who should beleeue, or who should remaine in that faith, which must afterward be propped and helped by his grace, and that hee predestinated them vnto his kingdome, who being freely called, he foresaw that they would be worthie of election, and that they would depart out of this life ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a good end.
