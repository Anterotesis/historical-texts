         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>DEar and tender plants of my heavenly Father, the salutation of my love dearly doth greet you all, in the spirit that giveth life, by which you are brought afresh to my remembrance, even at this present time, (in these my present bonds, for the word of God, and the testimony of Christ Jesus:) and that not without living breathings ariseing in my heart unto the Lord for you, that the God of all life, vertue, and living refreshment may daily water and nourish you with his heavenly life, love, and vertue, causing you to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in all the fruits of righteousnesse, to the everlasting praise of his great and glorious Name; that so you being fully rooted, fixed, and establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, in the root of life (<hi>the stem and off-spring of David</hi>) may grow up as plants of righteousness, and flourish as Willows by the water courses, that your branches may never wither, nor your fruit perish: but that the vertue of your leaf may be for the healing of the Nations, and your fruit may remain, (in the winter stormes and tempests,) to the everlasting praise and glory of the Lord God of the vine-yard, who hath planted and watered you, and who also hath and will give an encrease unto all you, who exalt not above the root, nor lift up your selves against the other branches, but abides in the true vine, and keeps your place in the ground and root of life, into which the Father hath implanted and grafted you, that ye never may be plucked up, nor cut off as withered and unfruitfull branches, but that the vertue of the root of life, may put forth it self through you, and in the vertue and life thereof you may grow up, fructifie, and abound in all the fruits of righteousness, thankesgiving and praise, to the everlasting glory and renown of the Lord of the vineyard, who is God over all, blessed for evermore.</p>
            <p>And dear and tender plants, this is with me further to signifie unto you that it was purposed in my heart to have visited you, in the bowels of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall love, (with my dear and honorable Brother and companion in the Lord <hi>W. D.</hi>) But Sathan hath hindred us, who in Ages and Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

wells of <hi>Iacob,</hi> by depriving the heritage of the Lord, of those pretious and refreshing oportunities, which our God hath afforded us, in our holy assemblings and comings together to wait upon him, to be strengthned and refreshed by him, and to build up, strengthen and comfort one another, in the most holy saith, even with the same strength, vertue, and consolation, wherewith we our selves are strengthned, comforted and refreshed of our God. And glory be to the Lord God for ever, concerning this I am fully assured, that the expectation of the wicked one herein shall be frustrated, and that the God of all comfort and consolation hath and doth answer the request of our soules concerning you, who abide faithfull to him, in the light of his everlasting covenant, in that he will manifest his heavenly vertue with you, whether together or assunder as outwardly, and open the spring of eternall life in you: and therein make you as a well-spring of living refreshment one unto another. And though he hath permitted the adversary so far to prevaile against us, or to exercise his rage on us, as to cast our bodies into prison, (is he did the very dearest Saints and servants of the God of Heaven în th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> dayes past: yet herein also I am fully confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the wrath of men shall be turned to the praise of our God, and the remainder thereof he will restrain, and so concerning this I am fully satisfied, and rest in peace in the (will or rather) permission of our God, believing assuredly that this also shall work for our consolation, that the depth of the riches of Gods love unto us ward may more abundantly be made manifest, both in the preservation and deliverance of us, in his own appointed time, untill which we rest in the will of our God, (being singly given up, that, that may be done by us, and fulfilled in us.) In which rest yee with us my dear friends, for though in bodily presence, we are seperated from you, and letted from visiting of you, (for a little season) yet in spirit we are with you, &amp; in the bowels of eternal love, our hearts are enlarged to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, much more then what is needfull to be expressed in lines of this kind, seeing in the word of the Lord God you may read us and feel us near unto you, and with you all, even as in an epistle written in your harts to be seen and read by you all.</p>
            <p>Wherefore in that receive ye a visitation of tender love from him that travels in spirit, (although outwardly in bonds) for your preservation, growth, and prosperity every way in Gods pretious truth, by which you were at first convinced, for there is not preservatian, growth, nor any true prosperity in or by another, then in that which hath been declared of unto you, from the beginning, even the light of Christ Jesus, the word of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:94320:3"/>
the gospel of truth, by which at first your hearts were opened and turned towards the Lord, and repentance given unto life never to be repented of, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ, and fervent love begotten in your hearts one towards another, by which word of the Gospel my heart is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged unto you, in an abundant manner, and therein also let me inlarge my self a little, by writing a few lines unto you in simplicity and truth, though you need it not, who are taught by the anoynting that dwelleth in you, in all things, and your hearts established in righteousnesse, yet seeing all a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>O you dear and tender plants of my Father,</hi> that ye be watchful at all times, and take heed of that which would exalt you above your root, or draw you into highnesse and loftinesse of minde, above the feeling of the daily crosse, kept over and above the earthly or fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shly part, for that is to be beat down, and kept in subjection, or else it will cause you to wither and dry up at the root, if that be nourished and cherished in you, which the Lord God hates and resisteth: but he giveth grace to the humble, wherefore, my dear friends in lowlinesse of heart and minde, walk ye in the daily crosse unto that part and nature, which would crucifie the Son of God afresh, and cause you to build again those things, which you once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, by getting up into a fleshly liberty and exaltation, which is not the liberty of the Sons of God [who have dominion over that part, which would cause the offence of the crosse to cease,] for such as give way unto that, though they have begun in the Spirit, yet will end in the flesh: and though they once might partake of the virtue of the root of life, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards degenerate from it, and bring not forth fruit unto God, but both branch and fruit perishes: so against that, friendes, all are to watch, which would lead out into fleshly liberty, or into any exaltation of flesh or spirit, [above the daily crosse of Christ] how glorious soever it may appear to the outward eye, yet a snare of death there is in it, and the vertue of the pretious life will withdraw it self from such as follow it, &amp; though they may flourish as a green bay-tree [in the profession of truth] yet the vertue of the root of life having withdrawn it self, their leaf will shortly wither, and they become as corne that groweth on the house top, that brings not forth fruit to perfection.</p>
            <p>And therefore my dear friends, the word of exhortatation, which ariseth in my heart unto you all is, dwell low in the fear of the Lord God, and in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94320:4"/>
humility of heart walk with him, in the measure of that grace ye have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him, for that is safe for you all, and to him that hath shall be given, that he may have in abundance, but unto him that hath not profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in that which he hath, even that which he hath shall be taken from him. Watch you therefore my dear friends, that a daily profiting you may know, in that tallent which is committed unto you, for there is no profiting in or by another, nor by what another hath received of it: but by abideing in that which ye have received of God in your own perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: that you may feel that grow and increase in you, and you in it untill it have wholy leavened you into its own proper vertue and nature; and thereby an entrance is and will be administred unto you more and more into that which is eternal, even into the kingdome and life of our Lord Jesus Christ: and you will feel an habitation in that, and and a sitting down in it, which indeed is exceeding pretious, and will countervaile all your sufferings, labours, and travels for it. And that you will feel raised up in you, which serves God as naturally, and does his will, unto which his commands are not grevious, but joyous, nor is his yoke burthensome, but this brings forth fruit naturally unto God: for indeed it is of him and from him, and not of this world, but born from above, and seeks those things that are eternal, and to be unto God in deed, in truth, and in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and though this brings forth the workes of God outwardly before men, and stands singly given up in body soul and spirit to serve him in all things; and to do his will, that therein the Father may be glorified, yet it doth not seek to appear before men, nor to be approved by men in any thing, but to answer the Lord in all things: and to stand approved in his sight, and unto his witnesse in every conscience, and this is the son of God for ever, and heir of the Kingdome, and a plant of the right hand of the God of Heaven, which naturally bringeth forth fruit to the praise of the Lord of the vineyard, who hath planted and watered it. And so dear friends feel this in you, all raised up, begotten and brought forth, for this will the Lord God cherish, [as a Father his onely begotten:] and this shall receive the rain in due season, even the former and latter rain, the dew of Heaven, and the fatnesse of the good ground shall daily water and nourish this in the root, and in the branch: and though the briars and thorns may seek to smother this, yet the fire of the Lord shall consume them, and every plant that the Father hath not planted, which seeks to hinder the growth of this, the axe of the Lord shall cut them up: so that the leaves of this shall never wither, nor its blossomes perish; the scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94320:4"/>
heat in the Summer, nor the stormy blasts in the Winter, shall have no power over it, because it is rooted in an eternal ground of life, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the dew of of Heaven which causeth it to flourish and blossome in due season, and bring forth fruit to perfection, to the everlasting glory and renown of the Lord of the Vineyard, over all who is blessed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
            <p>And so dear Plants of my heavenly Father, recieve ye my words in the word of life from whence they were written, and therein also may you read, feel, and receive the thing I testifie of, and exhort unto, even the engrafted word which is able to save your souls, that by it you may have power over that whether in your selves or in others, which would draw you from the root of life, [or word engrafted] in your own parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, for that is your enemy, and to be watched and warred against, (which would draw you from that) in whatever appearance it may come unto you in, that as an Angel of light to draw you from the light of life revealed in you, or from the present sensible feeling of your own particular estate and conditions in it, into something before or behind, which may seem glorious unto the eye that is abroad, saying, <hi>Lo here, or there, is the Kingdome of God,</hi> in this, or that, or the other observation, and thereby seek to raise up a covetting or longing desire, to be in another state or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in a higher or more glorious state or dispensation, then what you are grown into, by the light of life, the manifestation of Gods spirit, which is given unto you to profit withall; but I say unto you goe not forth, but abide with the Lord in that which ye have received of him, that by it a growth and enterance may be administred unto you, into the Kingdome in deed, and in truth; for the Kingdome of God comes not by observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, or that, or the other thing, nor yet stands it in high words, or guilded and coyned expressions, but in judgement and mercy, in peace, in truth, and in righteousnesse, and happy are they that enter it through judgement and righteousnesse, and sit down in it, in the peace that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures for ever, and goes no more forth to the right hand, nor to the left, for the things that are behind also, may the enemy tempt you withal, to draw back your minds from the Lord, into the glory of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the thing which you have once turned your backs upon, even the fading enjoyments of this present life, saying, <hi>All this will I give thee,  if thou will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>You therefore, my dear friends, that know a cutting off from the old root, and a grafting again into the true Vine the light of life, and word of the Lord God, by which your hearts are in measure cleansed, sanctified and purified from the pollutions of the world, abide ye in that word for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and goe not forth to look for, or covet after another dispensation of life or glory, nor seek not another Kingdome besides that which is revealed in the light, which as ye abide in it, an enterance will be administred into it from day to day, and a growth into that state and condition, which the high and lofty spirits, which have left their habitations, and are exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the root of life in themselves fall short of, though they may have great swelling words, of those things which they have not witnessed, tasted nor handled of, being vainly puft up in their fleshly minds, and boast of things above their line, or of the estate whereunto they have not attained.</p>
            <p>But this I say unto you, my dear friends, goe not forth unto any of these exalted spirits, in any of these glorious temptations, which promiseth great things, but there is a lye in (that which may seem to be) their right hand, and therefore goe not forth, but abide with the Lord for ever, in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his eternal truth which changeth not, (though many may turn from it,) nor waxeth not old, but abideth the same for ever, for there is your safety. And as you abide in this, and stand singly girt up in it, here no deceitful spirits can come nor enter, but they will be seen and judged, whether they come from within, or from without, and whatever their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering or appearance may be, yet being out of the vertue and savour of life their root and ground will be seen, discovered, and judged, and so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            <p>MY dearly beloved Friends, who are sensible of the breathings of life in your selves, and of the power of the everlasting Gospel of peace, my unfeigned brotherly love flowes, forth unto you, from the immortall life, which the God of my life, hath manifested in my mortal body, and with the salutation of this my reall love do I greet you all, whom God hath called and chosen in these perillous times: to be a peculiar people unto himself, to shew forth his praise, and not your own, to declare his wonderous works, and not your own, to get honour and renown unto him in the earth, and not unto your selves: for he hath bought you with a price, therefore are you not your own, and he hath redeemed you from the corruptible, by that which is incorruptible, and therefore how should you continue in that which is corruptible to the satisfying your wills, and the wills of corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, who are in the corruptible, and in their unconverted estate, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing their own wills: shewing forth their own praise, declaring their own workes, admireing and worshiping of them, and getting honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown unto themselves in the earth, honouring, regarding and serving the Creatures more then the Creator, even as we in the times of ignorance have done before the redemption [before mentioned was witnessed] or the election known, which now many are made witnesses of, glory be unto the most high for evermore.</p>
            <p>Wherefore Friends, answer ye the Lords end in calling of you, and his end in purchasing of you, and his end in redeeming of you, which may be answered by your faithfulnesse unto the Lord, and in so doing every one will have his reward with him, for every one that answers the Lords end, for which the Lord called him: comes to enjoy his presence, comes to be filled with love, life, joy and peace, and such do really shew forth his praise, and declare his wonderous works to the bringing of honour and renown unto him, and not unto themselves: but they that are unfaithfull and disobedient, though called, they do not answer the end, for which they were called, and therefore doth not the Lord so reward them, through his dwelling with them, through filling them with love, life, joy, and peace, as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94320:6"/>
he rewards the other that are faithfull, but on the contrary they who are called and are not faithful, as to answer the end for which they are called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they, (I say) are filled with sorrow, and unbelief, with trouble, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, and condemnation pursues them, from that which called them, which they being unfaithful unto, it ministers not consolation but condemnation, it speaks not peace but warre, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And this being alwaies present with them to put them in mind of their neglect, of their unfaithfulnesse, of their disobedience, and of their unworthinesse, they are alwayes disquieted and tosticated in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and in such, the murmurer and unbeliever hath place, and such are very unfitting to bear crosses, tryals and sufferings, for all these will adde to the trouble, which they were before possessed withall, so that very many inconveniences do ensue, where the end for which God called a people is not answered by them that are called; therefore, my dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved friends, be mindeful not onely of the end, for which you are called, but of answering the same, that the Lords delight may be to do good unto you; who are his peculiar treasure, and live all in his eternall power and spirit, that you may know the Lord and his eternall truth to be on your sides, when furious men rise up against you, then need you not be afraid, of what they can do unto you, for hath not the Lord oftentimes already suffered many of you to be tried, through the fury of the wicked, which at sundry times hath been high against you, but how hath the Lord turned it backward, and how hath he restrained the wickednesse of the wicked by his mighty power from being executed upon you: even to your own admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hath not the Lords end in this been to engage you through his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy, so much the more unto him, who oftentimes suffered the fury of the ungodly to break forth a little, yet not for the destroying, but for the trying his people, and how near have we found him unto us, even as a rock of defence to fly unto in our greatest straites; difficulties, and temptations, and what free accesse have we had unto him, through his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal spirit in our selves, when by Jayles, houses of correction, force of Armes and the like, we have been hindred from having accesse one unto another, or for meeting together in the outward, yet by those things before mentioned, we could not be hindred from meeting together in the Lord, I mean in the eternal spirit, when the fury of the wicked hath been as the rageing of the Sea, and having then the testimony of the Lords eternal Spirit in our selves, that we had answered the Lords end in his calling of us, in that we had faithfully shewn forth his praise, and brought honour
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94320:7"/>
and renown unto his Name upon earth, Oh! what joy and peace, that, did bring unto our soules, and how did we rejoyce in the Lord when he cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered our heads, as in the day of battell, even untill that the fury of the wicked came to be abated so oftentimes [you know] have we seen the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent hand of our God stretched out for our deliverance, which hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto preserved us to our great admiration, therefore, let us who have had such experience of the faithfulnesse of our God endeavour to be like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, even faithfull as he is faithfull.</p>
            <p>And now forasmuch as that in these perillous times, we cannot well serve our God in that way, in which he required us to walk, without being in jeopardy of bonds and imprisonments: or to have other sufferings imposed upon us, by reason of our meeting together to wait upon the Lord, and it doth therefore so much the more concern us to feel the drawings of our God by his eternal Spirit to our meetings; that when we are met we may so much the more enjoy his presence in our meetings, to the refreshment of our soules, and then if we suffer for waiting upon him, he will not leave us comfortlesse in that suffering, which for that cause comes upon us: [and this is the word of trueth unto you] neither will it be grievous to us, while we keep in that through which we enjoyed him in our meeting, for in that may we enjoy him in our sufferings: and then it will be better to be one day in a prison with the Lord, then a thousand else where, without the enjoyment of his presence, in which we have found, (as you know) much joy and peace, much comsort and consolation, and therefore have we cause to hazard our liberty, through our keeping of our meeting, though we be accounted by men offenders for so doing, rather then through the neglecting of them, we should become offenders in the light of the Lord, through whose mercy we are come to know the benefit of them, to the end we might prise and frequent them, and not slight nor neglect them, for it is certain if we neglect them, we shall not reap any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by them, but if we frequent them, according to the manner of the faithfull, then will the Lord be with us at them: and amongst us in them, and then his end in bringing of us into the practise of such meetings, will be answered to his glory and our comforts.</p>
            <p>Again as concerning swearing, what was the Lords end in giving us to see the evil of this? was it not that we should keep clear of it, and bear our faithful testimony against it, as against a hurtful evil, which is direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the doctrine of Christ, and seeing we have known the terrours of the Lord God against this evil, and have therefore perswaded others from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:94320:7"/>
it, how can we therefore in any wise consent unto it, as to do it, though we should therefore lose both our liberties and estates, for surely the Lord hath an end in convincing us of it, &amp; in shewing us the evil of it, and if we keep clear of it, and bear a faithful testimony against it unto the end, then the Lords end in convincing us of the evil of it, will be— Answered; who knew before what would come upon us, by reason of our testimony against it. And if God had not suffered this as a snare in the hand of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, there would have been something else, (as there are besides things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) which they take up as occasions ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inst us, as covers for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and these things are not without the Lords permission, who will try his Jewells as Gold that is seven times purified, and the more that we keep our Consciences void of off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce towards him and man, the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious we shall be in his sight, but if we should love our Liberties, our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states or Lives more then him who hath said, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> and for the saving of these should swear, conttary to his command, we should not onely neglect answering his end in forbidding of it, but incurre his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure against us, and while through doing that which he forbids, we may think to save our Liberties, estates, and lives, we might even in a moment loose them all, for we know they are uncertain, therefore let us answer the Lords end in shewing us the evil of this also, and in being faithful in this, and in all other things, we shall find life, riches, and liberties, which the world can neither give us, nor take from us. Moreover Friends, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning your Return again to the Steeple-houses, and unto which some would force you at this day, but alas, shall not he that sitteth in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens laugh at their folly? for doth not the least amongst you know that was not the Lords end in bringing you out of them; (I mean, that you should return to them again) neither needed you have suffered upon this account by that generation that continues in them, if God had not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to have tryed you out of them, and that by the suffering which comes, and will come upon you, for not repairing to them; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse if you would rather answer the Adversaries will by your returning to them again, then the Lords end in calling you out of them, then you might suddenly free your selves from suffering upon this account; but I doubt not out you are otherwise minded, yea, resolved to answer the Lords end in his calling you out of them, notwithstanding your Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94320:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
count, for I testifie unto you it is not for the destroying of any, though it may tend to the proving of many.</p>
            <p>Wherefore my dear friends, let none be discouraged nor terrified at what the Lord suffers to come upon you, by reason of your meetings, by reason of your not swearing, by reason of your not going to their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worship, or by reason of any other particular thing, as in relation to the truth of our God; for while suffering comes upon you onely by reason of the truth, you need not be ashamed of it, neither will the Lord leave you comfortlesse in it, for he is ready to succour such as for conscience sake suffer by reason of these things, even as thousands, (who have found it by experience) can testifie.</p>
            <p>In the mean time comfort ye one another in the bowels of love, and be ye tender affectionated one to another, and regard not the present threatnings of men, nor look not at the present tribulations, but regard the truth in your selves; and look unto the Lord, and hear what he saith, and if he speak peace, be not ye troubled, though men speak and prepare war against you, but hold ye alwaies fast the word of Gods power and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, which is able to preserve and keep you in all your sufferings and tribulations, even unto the day of salvation, and unto this do I commit you all (my dearly beloved friends) as unto that which is able to save you all to the utmost, so the peace and blessing of the Almighty be with, upon, and among you all, for evermore.</p>
            <p>I suppose many of you have heard of my bonds, how that after God of his mercy had delivered me out of a mighty violent storm at Sea, I was cast in here, where they in Authority have shewed themselves to be worse to me, and the friends with me, then the Barbarious people of <hi>Melita</hi> was to <hi>Paul,</hi> and them that were with him; who shewed them no small kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for they received and lodged them courteously; but these that are called Christians shewed themselves to be barbarous rather then courteous, in that they broke up our Meeting with many Souldiers, and afterwards committed us to prison, and in stead of shewing us much kindnesse, they have been so cruell to us, as that sometime it was difficult for us to get water and bread, and so were farre from courteously entertaining of us, or with honouring of us with many honours, as the <hi>Barbarians</hi> did them before mentioned; howbeit, the Lord is with us, and their cruelty hath been little to us, for we know that our God will in his own due time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us out of their hands, when our testimony is sufficiently born amongst them, but of this I am very sensible, that with the baptisme

of suffering under this spirit of persecution in the Nation, many are to be baptized into the fellowship of the Gospell with the Saints in light, and blessed and thrice happy are they, and will they be, that continue faithfull unto the end, for they shall be saved.

            <p>And this I have seen in the light of the Lord, that they that cannot bring people from under the power of Satan, they cannot give up them unto Satan, who through the power of God are brought (as you are) from under Satans power. 2ly.

I cannot see that they can excommunicate you out of that which many of you never were in, (I mean, their Church, or its fellowship) but suppose you had been in it, what evil can they lay to your charge, by reason of which they should deliver you unto Satan; of which they not being able to convince you, ought not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

and by bringing you first into fellowship, before they had gone about to have excommunicated you out of that, which many of you never have been in. And though at first they may pretend love unto your souls, but ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But methinks I have seen them, as men in an old decayed ruined ship at sea, that was ready to perish, who cryed to some that were in a safe harbour to come to their ship for safety, and pretended much love unto them, but they in the harbour being wise, would not come into their rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ship for many good reasons, whereupon they in the ship grew angry, and pretending to force them into the ship, but did presently throw them into the sea, before ever they got them into the ship; thus their treachery appeared, who pretended love, but were filled with envie. Is it not thus with them that goe about to draw you from your safe harbour, (at which many of you through mercy are arrived) who while they pretend they would force you out of love to your souls into their Church fellowship, do in their haste before they get you so farre, deliver you (so much as in them lyeth) unto Satan: oh! who would therefore put confidence in such men, for surely they are of them who rather seeks your's then you, and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther share your Estates then have your society; therefore, well said the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>Turn away from such</hi>; and in the same spirit (according to my measure) say I, <hi>Turn not again unto such, least while you turn unto them, you turn from following the Lamb, and come then through the Lambs power to be excommunicated out of the fellowship with the Saints in light, and come thereby to be delivered unto Satan, which God forbid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Friends, however of this I am assured, and can assure you, that by all their power, whether Ecclesiastical or Civil, they shall not be able to excommunicate you, out of that Church which is in God, nor out of the fellowship of the Saints in light; neither shall they by their power whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ecclesiastical or Civil, deprive you of your peace and comfort in the Lord, while you abide faithful. Let this therefore be your comfort in the height of your sufferings, when they cast you out of their Synagogues, and say, <hi>Let the Lord be glorified</hi>; and when they spoil your goods, and cast your bodies into prison, and say they will make you examples, that others may fear, oh be not ye troubled at any of these things, for the Lamb <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Therefore, be of good chear in the midst of these your sufferings which now you are to follow the Lamb through, who through sufferings was made perfect, and now sits at the right hand of his father in the highest heavens, where they that now suffer upon earth for his names sake, shall reign with him in glory and immortality for ever and ever.</p>

            <head>Another EPISTLE, To Friends.</head>
            <p>DEar Brethren and Sisters in the Lord Jesus Christ, I salute you in the bowells of tender love; Dear Friends, all keep low in the life, that the living vertue you all may feel to nourish the tender Babe of God, and all be tender over the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in your own particulars, and that will lead you to be tender over one another, and all keep in the pure wisdome of God, and watch one over another with a single eye, and you that are strong bear the weak, and come into onenesse, onenesse of mind, for there the blessing is; so dear hearts, I am filled with the streams of Gods eternal love, and my streams of love floweth towards you all: So friends, sink down into the life and power of God, that you may be preserved pure and clean, that nothing may arise which would break your peace with God, that you may be preserved in unity with him, and one with another, that pure love may spring up one to another, in which love you will be all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed, and be as a watered Garden, feeling the well within, from whence the living streams flowes forth, and this keeps all broken and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; so all that which is hard, rough, untoward, or pievish, is kept out; yea, all that which would make a rent, is seen, and comprehended, and with the light of Jesus Christ judged, and you by the word of power re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto God, and one to another: and let your meeting be in that, so will you all feel the presence of the living God amongst you, and there are we knit together in one, and in that am I with you, and near you all, and feel you who are in the life and power of truth, where the presence of the Lord is felt, where we reign and trample upon all that which would lead from the truth. So dear friends, keep within, and stay your minds in the light of Christ, that you may grow up in the soundnesse, to be of a sound mind, not soon shaken, but seek the rock Christ to stand upon; dwell in that which changeth not, that in the onenesse you may be kept,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94320:11"/>
for the Light of Christ changeth not; to all that which is in the changing is not of Christ, who changeth not: And to that measure of life I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you all, which at first convinced you, which begot love and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse in you towards God and towards one another: Ah friends, in that keep, so shall you feel peace.</p>
