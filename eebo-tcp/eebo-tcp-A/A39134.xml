            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>HOW ſad a ſtroke, how deep a <hi>wound</hi> is this,</l>
               <l>That yet we cannot tell how great it is!</l>
               <l>But only our juſt fears conclude ſo far,</l>
               <l>At beſt, 'twill not be <hi>Heal'd</hi> without a <hi>Scar.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who can compute that loſs, which no man dare</l>
               <l>To ſay, that ever 'twill admitt repair?</l>
               <l>For that the <hi>World</hi> muſt not expect ſuch <hi>Men,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>No, nor the <hi>Church</hi> ſuch <hi>Officers</hi> agen.</l>
               <l>Had but a ſence of this poſſeſt the Age,</l>
               <l>A <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Lamentations,</hi> not a <hi>Page</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Would regiſter our fate, and ſo tranſmit</l>
               <l>At once the Mem'ry both of him and it.</l>
               <l>Such <hi>Tribute,</hi> 'tis not a few <hi>drops</hi> that can</l>
               <l>Diſcharge, unleſs we weep an <hi>Ocean;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>If that our <hi>Heads</hi> were <hi>Waters,</hi> and our <hi>Eyes</hi>

               <l>To teſtifie their own aſtoniſhment;</l>
               <l>And if <hi>two Ages</hi> could to us reſtore</l>
               <l>Bleſſings as great as thoſe we had before,</l>
               <l>The want of theſe we better might ſuſtain,</l>
               <l>And be content with thoſe which yet remain.</l>

               </l>
               <l>Such comfortable thoughts; when the ſame ſin</l>

               <l>Is lodg'd already, there we Hope at laſt</l>
               <l>To <hi>get aſhore,</hi> when all theſe <hi>ſtorms</hi> are paſt:</l>
               <l>Mean while we need our <hi>Pilot;</hi> for we hear</l>
               <l>The <hi>Winds</hi> are <hi>whiſp'ring,</hi> and the <hi>Clouds</hi> appear,</l>
               <l>The <hi>Floods</hi> are <hi>moving,</hi> and without controul</l>

               <l>With Threat'ning voice <hi>Deep unto deep doth call;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>So great <hi>our</hi> Dangers are, <hi>Thine</hi> none at all.</l>
               <l>Could we but <hi>ſee the Heavens open'd,</hi> where</l>
               <l>The joyful throng of Saints and Angels are,</l>
               <l>We ſhould then ſee, (thô all have perfect bliſs)</l>
               <l>How many <hi>Sheaves</hi> do there <hi>bow down to his:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>How <hi>near</hi> to Chriſt's right hand he ſits; his Crown</l>
               <l>Of Glory, how it weighs the others <hi>down;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>How <hi>few removes</hi> he's ſeated from the Throne</l>
               <l>Above his Brethren, would then be known;</l>
               <l>But when at laſt our Lord and Judge ſhall come</l>
               <l>In Majeſty, to paſs our final Doom,</l>
               <l>Then ſhall he ſit upon the <hi>Bench,</hi> with thoſe</l>
               <l>Wh' as Chriſt's <hi>Aſſeſſors,</hi> ſhall condemn his Foes.</l>
               <l>Conſid'ring theſe <hi>Dark Clods</hi> of Earth, How <hi>bright</hi>

               <l>He <hi>Labour'd more abundantly than All,</hi>
