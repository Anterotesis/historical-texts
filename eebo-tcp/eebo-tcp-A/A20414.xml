            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore the tyme that something of myne did passe the PRESSE, without my knowledge, or allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wance, I did not mynde to come abroad in this Learned Age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in manie, more able Men than I am, doe keepe silence; my Furniture beeing fitter for my present Charge, than for more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Edification, in my judgement; and my Employmentes so frequent, as my spare tyme is little, for farther extent of what the <hi>LORD</hi> hath bestowed vpon mee. But, since that tyme, my just Feares, from apparent grounds,
<pb facs="tcp:10219:3"/>
that numbers of my <hi>SERMONS,</hi> vvhich were rudelie, and popularlie, delivered, (as thryse, or foure tymes Preaching a-weeke, might yeelde) and taken from my Mouth, as it was possible to over-take the current of running speach; the judicious Wryter ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king what hee had over-taken, to coheare, the best hee could; and Copies going from him, to manie, with numbers of Faultes, and misstakinges of the Transcribers; I beeing vnable to revise, (for straytnesse of tyme) anie thing which was written by them, first, or last. My just Feares, I saye, that these should come to thy Handes, rude and faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as they are, made mee willing rather, when <hi>GOD</hi> should graunt mee leasure heere-after, to draw vp, in short, the poyncts of Doctrine delivered by mee in these <hi>SER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MONS</hi>; that thou mightest haue a twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or thirtie of them, or moe, possible, in the boundes and pryce of one at large.</p>
            <p>With this passage of <hi>GOD'S</hi> providence, another hath concurred, to drawe foorth this piece vnto thy view in the meane tyme, which is this: When I considered, howe largelie <hi>GOD</hi> hath provyded HELPS, for vnderstanding of holie SCRIPTVRE, by large Commentaries, and sweete Sermons,
<pb facs="tcp:10219:3"/>
especiallie from His Church in ENGLAND; where-by increase of Knowledge is given to the Learned, and such whose meanes to buy, and leasure from their calling to reade, and victorie over their owne laysinesse, for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king paynes, doeth concurre with their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, for making vse of this the <hi>LORD'S</hi> Liberalitie; I haue often requested the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Lightes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To helpe such as eyther could not, or else would not, profite themselues by that, vvhich is alreadie graunted in His Bountie, by some short, and playne manner of wryting; vvhere-by the weaker judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes might bee supported, and all Excuse taken away from the wittie Sluggard, and such whose worldlie Employmentes, and great Effayres, haue seemed sufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to excuse their negligence, and the small and naughtie matters of their owne Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Kingdome of <hi>HEAVEN,</hi> and Evidences thereof in <hi>SCRIPTVRE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, to this purpose, I haue beene verie instant, vvith the Godlie-Learned of myne acquayntance, to take this matter in hand; and, to divyde, amongst them, the hard parts of <hi>SCRIPTVRE,</hi> at least; that this worke might bee done by the handes of manie, vvhich could not bee done by one. I found
<pb facs="tcp:10219:4"/>
their approbation of my desire, and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable willingnesse, to put hand to worke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. But, some of them, for the weyght of their ordinarie Charge, some of them for age, and infirmitie of bodie, some of them for their handes full of the <hi>LORD'S</hi> worke in another sorte, could not adventure to bee straytlie ingaged in the worke. Where tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row I was forced, eyther to forsake my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, which daylie were kindeled within mee more and more; or else, come foorth with some-thing, of this kynde, as might bee; and seeke amongst my Readers, some to take this Matter to heart; and, to doe there-in, as the <hi>LORD</hi> should enable them, by themselues, or by others.</p>
            <p>I haue made choyse of this <hi>EPISTLE,</hi> which is a piece of hard Meate, in the estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation both of the <hi>APOSTLE,</hi> the Wryter there-of, (CHAP. 5. and 6.) and of <hi>PETER,</hi> giving his judgement of it, (2. PET. 1.15.16.) That if I should attayne anie parte of myne intent, in anie measure, in so hard a place, I might encowrage others, to take in hand a more easie parte of <hi>SCRIPTVRE,</hi> with more hope of successe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Summe</hi> of each <hi>Chapter,</hi> or the <hi>Contents,</hi> doe stand in steade of <hi>Analysis</hi>; and, in some
<pb facs="tcp:10219:4"/>
places, of a <hi>Paraphrase.</hi> The <hi>Text</hi> doeth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, <hi>Verse</hi> by <hi>Verse.</hi> The exposition of the <hi>Verse,</hi> serveth for groundes of Doctrines; which Doctrines, following vpon the groundes, are joyned, moste parte, with the Note of Collection [THEN.] Pluralitie of Doctrines from the ground, or from the <hi>Text</hi> where the consequence is easie to bee percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is distinguished by Figures, according to their numbers. Tearmes of Arte I haue es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed, because I would bee playne to all. I haue spared all enlargement of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which I could spare; leaving them as graynes of Seede, to get their growth in thy mynde, by Meditation, which is necessarie for such as loue to make vse of this sort of wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; because I would be short. The speciall handeling of such Passages, as the Apostle ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out of the Olde Testament, I haue left to their owne proper place. Quotations, for confirmation of my Doctrines, drawne from the ground, I haue spared also: Because, I jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, If the Doctrine was pertinentlie colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the ground, the <hi>Text</hi> in hand was sufficient confirmation. And if it bee not pertinentlie collected, I am content that thou passe by it, and take onelie what is pertinent. A quotation could prooue the Doctrine true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:10219:5"/>
but not prooue it pertinent: and, so, not serue my purpose. Manie moe, and more perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Consequences, the Learned will finde, which I haue not observed: but not <hi>for</hi> the Learned, or such as are able, and willing, to make vse of larger Wrytinges, doe I intende this present.</p>
            <p>Therefore, doe not looke howe much thou doest misse, which might haue beene sayde; but, what in the first frame of this moulde could bee done, in such brevitie. Which moulde, I trust, the Learned shall helpe, if it please the <hi>LORD</hi> to stirre them vp, to take this matter in hand. I haue preassed, singlie to poynct out Trueth, without <hi>Partialitie</hi>; not wresting the Text, to reach a Blowe to anie man. And, what thou shalt make of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Piece, I am not carefull, if I can obtayne there-by, that more able Men may bee set on worke, to doe what I intend, but cannot doe.</p>
            <p>If the precious Iewell of the <hi>SCRIPTVRE</hi> may bee more esteemed of, and made vse of, which is more necessarie for our Soules, than the Sunne in the Firmament is for our bodies; and, the greatest gift next after our <hi>LORD IESVS</hi> downe-sending amongst vs, that ever the Worlde saw. If I may by this piece, I say, bee an Instrument, to stirre vp anie to the
<pb facs="tcp:10219:5"/>
loue of searching the <hi>SCRIPTVRES,</hi> I haue not lost my Paynes, what-so-ever shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of this little Booke: Where-vnto I haue sollisted for no Patronage vnder Heaven, but thy Christian Good-will to my Ayme, to haue our <hi>LORD</hi> the more honoured, in the sounde Knowledge, and right vse of His <hi>SCRIPTVRE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am confident, that thou wilt easilie judge, with mee, That the prowde, and prophane Despysers of <hi>GOD,</hi> are worthie to perish, amongst His Enemies: But, consider, and judge againe, If prophane Despysers of holie <hi>SCRIPTVRE,</hi> vvho disdayne to reade, or obey, what <hi>GOD</hi> commaundeth therein, bee not to bee ranked in the same Roll. For, <hi>GOD</hi> draweth so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igh vnto vs in His Word, speaking vnto vs, as a king vnto his Subjects, or a Master vnto his Servauntes; that the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, or disobedience, which wee giue to His Speaches, resolveth, directlie, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatelie, vpon <hi>GOD HIMSELFE.</hi> For, vvhat is it else, to heare, and belieue, and obey <hi>GOD</hi>; but, To heare, and belieue, and obey His Speaches? And, vvhat is it, Nor to take notice of <hi>GOD,</hi> to despyse, and disobey <hi>GOD</hi>; but, Not to take notice of His Speaches, not to reade His Wrytings,
<pb facs="tcp:10219:6"/>
and not to care for anie thing that Hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth, promiseth, or threatneth? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath the <hi>LORD</hi> written the Great thinges of His Lawe vnto vs, even to bee a Touch-Stone, not onelie to trye all mens Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine there-by, but also to trye all mens dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position towardes Himselfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, howe they stand affected to His Honour, whether as Foes, or as Friendes. For, What readier way is there, to get evidence of a man desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the Knowledge, Fayth, Loue, Feare, and the rest of the partes of the Image of <hi>GOD,</hi> than to finde him destitute of the Knowledge and Loue of the <hi>SCRIPTVRE?</hi> What surer Signe of a man, who, for the present, is enemie to <hi>GOD,</hi> and to the enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of His Gracious Kingdome, than to find him traducing the perfect Law of the <hi>LORD,</hi> and marring, to his power, the free course of the Scriptures light, which is the Scepter of <hi>CHRIST'S</hi> Kingdome? Agayne; What surer Signe of a Chyld of Promise, begotten of <hi>GOD,</hi> than to see him, with DAVID, PSAL. 119. making more of the Scriptures, nor of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and powring out all his Affections vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, as vpon the nearest Meane where-by <hi>GOD'S</hi> Spirit may be conveyed into his soule, for perfecting of Holinesse; and the readiest
<pb facs="tcp:10219:6"/>
Chariot, to carrie vp his spirite, to dwell in <hi>GOD,</hi> for perfecting of his happinesse?</p>
            <p>Wee shall find, also, answerable to <hi>GOD'S</hi> Purpose of trying men by His Scripture, His Wisdome, giving a due meeting vnto men, as they doe make vse of His Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doe they not reade it? or, doe they reade, and not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it? Doe they not weygh, what is impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by it, in sense, and meaning? It fareth with them, as with those to whom <hi>CHRIST</hi> sayd, MATTH. 22.29. <hi>You erre, not knowing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor the power of God.</hi> Doe they not loue it? Behold their Plague, 2. THESS. 2.10.11.12. <hi>Because they receaved not the loue of the Trueth, that they might be saved, for this</hi> verie <hi>cause,</hi> sayeth the Text, <hi>God shall send them strong delusion; that they should belieue a Lie, that they might be damned.</hi> Doe they not steadfastlie belieue, what they learne in Scripture? In God's judgement, with the foolish, and vnstable, they are suffered to wrest the Scriptures, to their own destruction, were they never so great wits, 2. PET. 3.16. Doe they not studie, to giue obedience vnto the knowne Trueth of it? He dealeth with them, as with <hi>Israell,</hi> PSAL. 81.11. <hi>My people would not hearken vnto My Voyce, and Israell would none of Mee.</hi> (Hee counteth Himselfe rejected, because His Word was rejected.) But what followeth,
<pb facs="tcp:10219:7"/>
               <hi>Vers.</hi> 12. <hi>So I gaue them vp, vnto their owne heartes lust: and they walked in their owne counsels.</hi> But to such as will bee Christ's Disciples indeede, Students, seeking to grow in Knowledge, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and obedience of His Word; seeking to loue Him, and keepe His Sayings, Hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, (IOHN 14.26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) to sende vnto them, <hi>The Spirit of Trueth, the Comforter, the holie Ghost, to teach them all things</hi>: That is, To perfect their knowledge, more and more, by His Spirit, to fill their hearts with joye and comfort, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to His Trueth, and to make them holie, more and more.</p>
            <p>And why are all these styles given? Even to show, that such as will haue Christ's Spirit to worke anie of these, must seeke Him to worke all of these, joyntlie, or not to haue Him for working anie of them at all.

from the beginning. 2. And what the Prophets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyghed from GOD, to the Church, by Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is called heere the speaking of GOD; so it is to bee accounted of still; and not as a dumbe letter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hee sayth, GOD spake</hi> at sundrie tymes. <hi>By manie partes, as the word importeth; now a part of His will, and then a part farther; at another tyme yet a part farther.</hi> Then, The LORD was in the way onlie, of revealing His whole Mynde to His Church, before CHRIST came; letting foorth Light, by little and little, till the Sunne of Righteousnesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> IESVS CHRIST, arose, and had not tolde His whole will. 2. And for this reason, the Iewish Church was bound to suspend her determination of the vnchangeablenesse of her Leviticall Service, till the Law-giver spake His last word, and vttered His full Mynde, in the fulnesse of tyme.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee sayeth, before CHRIST came, GOD spake in</hi> diverse manners.] <hi>Not revealing his Will after one manner; but sometime by viue voyce, sometime by vision or dream, or inspiration, or Vrim &amp; Thummim, by signes from Heaven, by types, and exercyse of shadowing Ceremonies.</hi> Then, No reason the Iewes should sticke so fast to the ordinances of Levi, (they beeing instituted in the tyme of the alterable courses of the Churches pedago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie) as not to giue way to the abolishing of them by the MESSIAS: Which to show, is a part of the Apostles mayne scope.</p>

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:10219:10"/>1. <hi>Hee sayeth, GOD who spake to the Fathers, hath spoken</hi> to vs.] Then, The same GOD, who is Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Olde Testament, is also Author of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the New Testament: and the Church of olde, and now, is taught of the same GOD; that the fayth of the Elect might depende vpon the authoritie of GOD onlie, both then and now; and not on men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>These are called the</hi> last <hi>dayes.</hi>] Then, The fulnesse of tyme is now come: The Law-giver of the Church hath spoken His last Will: His Mynde is fullie revealed; setled course for the Fayth, and service of His Church, is taken; after which no new alteration of His Constitutions is to bee expected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Hee sayeth, GOD spake to them by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but hath spoken to vs by</hi> His Sonne.] Then, 1. As the Sonne is aboue the servants; so is CHRIST aboue the Prophets. And no reason, that the Iewes should thinke so much of Moses, and the Prophets, as for them, to misregard CHRISTS Doctrine, and sticke to the Leviticall Service, vnder pretence of estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Prophets. 2. The Glorie of the Gospel, is greater than the glorie of the Law. 3. The glorie of the Ministeriall Calling of Preachers of the Gospell, is by so much the greater, as it hath the Sonne of GOD First-man in the Roll thereof; as first Preacher, and Prince of Preachers. 4. CHRISTS Sermons are all of them directed vnto vs: and so much more highlie should the Doctrine of the Gospell bee esteemed of, by vs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>In describing CHRIST, bee sayeth, the Sonne is Heyre of all thinges: that is, Hee hath received a Domination over all creatures, from the Father; that as Hee is LORD over all, so is CHRIST.</hi>] Then, 1. CHRIST is Heyre of all thinges in the Church also, LORD of the Sabbath, and of all the Service annexed

to it, to whom it is lawfull to chop and change the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viticall Ordinances, at His pleasure. 2. And Heyre of all the Prerogatiues and Promises, made to the Iewes, or others; through whom onelie, as the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Owner of all thinges, both Iew and Gentile must seeke and keepe Right to what they haue, or can clayme: And therefore, it behoved the Hebrewes, to enter themselues Heyres to their Priviledges by CHRIST, or else to bee disinherited.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Hee sayeth,</hi> GOD, by His Sonne, made the Worlds.] <hi>So hee calleth the World, for the varietie of tymes, &amp; ages, and fleeces of the creatures, one succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding another.</hi> Then, 1. CHRIST is GOD, Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all thinges. 2. Hee is a distinct person from the Father; by whom the Father made all. 3. That which the Father doeth, the Sonne doeth the same; yet so, as in order of working, the Father is first, and the Sonne is next; working with, and from the Father.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>IN describing CHRIST, hee vseth borrowed simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes: for, what proper word can bee found, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse so great a Mysterie? And, what can wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue of His Godhead, but by resemblance? Yea, hee vseth moe similitudes nor one; for it is but little wee can

                  <hi>of His Fathers Glorie.] The similitude is borrowed from the Sonne beams.</hi> Then, 1. As the Father is glorious, so is CHRIST His Sonne glorious, with the same Glorie. Therefore, 1. Cor. 2.8. Hee is called the LORD of Glorie. 2. As the beames of light haue their originall from the Sunne, so hath CHRIST His originall of the Father, and is vnseparable from Him: for, as the Sunne was never without its light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so neyther was the Father ever without the Sonne; but coëternallie with Him. 3. As the Sunne is not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested, but by its owne brightnesse; So the inaccessible light of the Fathers Glorie, is not revealed to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by the Sonne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>CHRIST is called the</hi> expresse Image <hi>of the Fathers Person.] The similitude is borrowed from a Signets impression, which representeth all the lineaments of the Seale.</hi> Then, 1. The Father is one person, and the Sonne is another person of the Godhead, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving His owne proper subsistence distinct from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 2. The Sonne resembleth the Father, fullie, and perfectlie; so that there is no perfection in the Father, but the same is substantiallie in the Sonne: As the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is Eternall, Omnipotent, Omnipresent, infinite in Wisedome, Goodnesse, Mercle, Holinesse, and all other Perfections; So is the Sonne Omnipotent, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and all that the Father is. 3. Whatsoever Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection wee can perceiue in CHRIST, shyning in His Manhead, or Word, or Workes; the same wee may conclude to bee in the Father also; whose resemblance, and expresse Image Hee is. Finde wee CHRIST good and mercifull, loving and pittifull, meeke and

lowlie: not abhorring the most vyle and miserable, whether in soule or bodie, that commeth vnto Him for reliefe; wee may bee assured, that such a one is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and no other wayes mynded to such as seeke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him through CHRIST.</p>
               <p n="3">3. CHRIST <hi>vpholdeth all things,</hi> by the word of His power.] Then, 1. The preservation of the creatures, as well as their creation, is from Christ. The Father vpholdeth all, so doeth the Sonne. 2. What Hee doeth, Hee doeth as Omnipotent GOD, by His Word, without trouble or burthen. As Hee spake, and all was done; So Hee but by His Word comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and all standeth fast. And this His Word is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but His powerfull Will, ordayning thinges to bee, and continue; and powerfullie making them so to bee, and continue, so long as Hee will.</p>
               <p n="4">4. CHHIST by Himselfe <hi>purged our sinnes. To wit, by bearing our sinnes vpon his Bodie on the Tree,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 24. Then, 1. Our sinnes are a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse, that must bee purged. 2. The satisfactorie cleansing of our sinnes, is not a thing to bee done by mens meritorious doinges, or sufferinges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alreadie done, and ended, by CHRIST, before Hee ascended; and that by Himselfe alone, all creatures beeing seclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. 3. Hee that vpholdeth all thinges, by the Word of His owne Power; and Hee that purged our sinnes, by His owne Blood, is but one selfe same Person; GOD and Man is Hee in one person.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>CHRIST sate downe on the</hi> right Hand <hi>of the</hi> Majestie <hi>on high.] That is, when CHRIST had cleansed our sinnes, by his death, hee ascended to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and possessed himselfe as Man, in the fellowship of the same Glorie, which as GOD hee had before the Worlde was, Iohn</hi> 17.4.5. Then, 1. The Sonne
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10219:12"/>
is joyned in the fellowship of the same Glorie with the Father, as well in his Manhead after his Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as in his Godhead before his Incarnation. For, though the Glorie of CHRISTS Godhead was hid, for a whyle, by the sufferinges of his Manhead, yet was it not abolished, nor in it selfe abated thereby: but the Manhead first was assumed vnto the vnitie of Person with the Godhead<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that our Ransome might bee rich; and then, to the vnion of the same Glorie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Redeemer, after the Ransomes paying, might bee altogether glorious. 2.

For there are three Rests in the Scripture, which may bee called GOD'S Rest: 1. GOD'S Rest vpon the first Sabbath: 2. The Rest of Canaan, typicall: 3. The Spirituall and true Rest of GOD'S People, in CHRIST'S Kingdome, which is a Delyverance, and ceassing from Sinne, and Miserie. David doeth not meane of the Rest of the Sabbath, in his Threatning; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, albeit the Worke of Creation was finished in the beginning of the Worlde, and that Rest come and gone; yet David speaketh of another Rest after that, in the word of Threatning, Vers. 3.

               <p>FROM THIS COMPARISON IT IS CLEARE, THEN<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.

                  <hi>Agayne from this Comparison, it is evident,</hi> That the holie Ghost is Author, both of these common Spirituall Giftes, and of these speciall Saving Graces also.

                  <hi>Thirdlie, from this Comparison, it is cleare,</hi> 1.

                  <hi>ANother Reason, to this same purpose: Levi payed Tithes to Melchisedek, in Abraham's loynes: Therefore, Melchisedek is greater in his priesthoode, than the Leviticall priestes. So was CHRIST in Abraham's loynes, will you say. I answere; CHRIST was the true represented priest, even when Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dek met Abraham: and in Melchisedek's person, as type, the honour was done to CHRIST, in trueth, and to his Priesthoode, by Abraham. And, agayne, CHRIST was in Abraham's loynes onelie in regarde of the matter of humane nature; not for the manner of propagation: and, so, is exempted from the lawe of naturall posteritie.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Alwayes, from this reasoning,</hi> WEE LEARNE, That, as receaving Tithes, prooveth superioritie in Office: So, paying of Tithes, or Mayntaynance in towne of Tithes, prooveth subjection to that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and Office-bearers, which receaue the same. And, so, Mayntaynance of Ministers, should bee a Matter of Honouring of them; or, rather, of Him that sent them, of its owne proper institution; though men turne it into a beggarlie Steepende; and count the more baselie of the Office, because of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Mayntaynance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Reason of Levie's paying of Tithes in Abraham's loynes,</hi> WEE LEARNE,</p>

Therefore, Perfection could not bee had by that Service: For it was evident, that neyther GOD was pacified, nor their Consciences quyeted, by anie thing in that Priesthoode: but all were sent to the thing signified, and to the tyme which was to come, in the Messias manifestation.</hi>

But, in Christ's Priesthoode, there is but one Man, even Himselfe; His Priesthoode is vndivided: no man beareth a parte of the burden with him: Hee, alone, attendeth all mens Sacrifices, by himselfe: Hee is at leasure, for everie man's employment, at all tymes, in the greatest throng of Sacrifices.</hi>

lyke AARON'S; which, for the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, That it had manie Priestes, was weake, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, and inferiour to CHRIST'S. 2. To make Priestes, by Office, in the New Testament, to offer vp anie corporall sacrifice, is to make CHRIST'S Pristhood separable from his owne person: vvhich is agaynst the nature of CHRIST'S Priesthood, which can not passe from one, to another: for so importeth the worde. 3. To make pluralitie of Priestes in Christ's Priesthood, Vicars, or Substitutes, or, in anie respect, part-taker of the Office with him, is to praesuppose, that Christ is not able to doe that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice alone; but, is eyther dead, or weake, that hee can not fulfill that Office: contrarie to the Text heere, which sayeth, <hi>Because hee continueth ever, hee hath an vnchaungeable Priesthood</hi>: or, a Priesthood which can not passe from one, to another.</p>

               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Differences, as the Apostle setteth them downe heere, are,</hi> 1. <hi>The Course taken about priests, vnder the Lawe, was alterable: they were made wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout an Oath; the Law-giver declaring it to bee his will, to chaunge that Course, when hee sawe it fitte. But the Course taken about the priestes of the Newe Testament, is with an Oath: and, so, can not bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

               <p n="2">2.

Melchisedek's Order in the Type, hath no priest but one in it, without a Suffragane, or substituted priest. Therefore, CHRIST, the true Melchisedek, is alone in his Priesthoode, without Partner, or Deputie, or Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragane.

               <p>
                  <hi>THEN,</hi> To make a man priest nowe, is to marre the Sonne of God's priviledge, to whome the priviledge onelie belongeth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Difference: <hi>The Law maketh such priestes, as haue infirmitie: that is, Sinfull Men, who can not make the sacrifice which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, effectuall, to pacifie; nor the Blessing which they pronounce, to come; nor the instruction which they giue, forcible to open the Eyes. But the Evangelicall Oath, maketh the Sonne, who is able to saue, to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost, all that come to GOD, through Him.</hi>

               <p n="5">5. The fift Difference. <hi>The Lawe maketh men Priestes, which haue infirmities, over whome Death had power, that they could not bee consecrated, but for their short lyfe tyme. But, the Evangelicall Oath, maketh the Sonne, whome the Sorrowes of Death could not holde; and hath consecrated</hi> Him <hi>for evermore.</hi>

                  <hi>THEN,</hi> As long as CHRIST'S Consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lasteth, none must meddle with His Office.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The last Difference. <hi>The Lawe instituting Priestes, was not GOD'S Last Will, but might suffer Addition. But, the Evangelicall Oath, is since the Lawe, and GOD'S last and vnchaungeable Will.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THEN,</hi> The Tabernacle, and Temple, vnder the Lawe, was but the shadowe; and Christ's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die was the true Tabernacle. For, 1. As the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles of GOD'S presence, was in the typicall Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle; So the fulnesse of the Godhead dwelleth bodilie in Christ. 2. As the typicall tabernacle had inclosed in it all the holie thinges, the Candle-sticke, Table of Shew-bread, Laver, Altar, &amp;c. So hath the humanitie of Christ, or Christ the Man, all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and perfection; the fulnesse of all good, and all holie thinges, in him, Light, Foode, Washing, and Reconciliation, and all in himselfe; that out of his fulnesse, wee may all receaue Grace for Grace. 3. As the Tabernacle, in the outmost Coveringes, seemed but base, yet had better stuffe within; So, our LORD, when hee dwelt in the tabernacle of

his flesh amongst vs, was found in forme as a man, and in the shape of a servaunt: but, inwardlie, was full of Grace, and Trueth.</p>

                  <hi>HEE prooveth, That</hi> Christ <hi>is the Minister of the Tabernacle of his owne Bodie, by offering it vp; because it behooved him, seeing hee is a Priest, to offer vp some-thing, eyther the typicall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, or else his owne Bodie, represented by them.

               <p>The Apostle acknowledgeth no Priest, but eyther the Leviticall priest, or the Priest that offereth vp his owne Bodie. And, who-so-ever pretendeth to haue the Office of a priest nowe, vsurpeth eyther the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Levite, or Christ's Office.</p>

were on earth, hee should not bee a Priest?</hi> I aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere; <hi>Because, albeit hee began his Priesthoode vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, yet hee could not brooke his Office of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode on the earth. For, as the high Priest, who was the Type, carried the Sacrifice, once a-yeare, through the Court, and before the Sanctuarie killed the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and then tooke the bloode thereof in vnto the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest of all, and presented himselfe there before the LORD, with the bloode, to intercede for the people, and there remayned, during the tyme of Intercession appoyncted to him: So</hi> Christ, <hi>carrying his Sacrifice out of the Citie, offered vp his Bodie, on the Altar of his Godhead, to his Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, by his owne bloode, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the heavenlie Sanctuarie, and sate downe, on the Right hand of the Majestie on high; and there hee liveth for ever, to intercede for vs, having then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Sacrifice, as this Apostle prooveth,</hi> Chap. vij.17. <hi>and</hi> Chap. ix.25.26. <hi>And, having no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice nowe to offer on earth, it is with reason, that the Apostle sayeth,</hi> If Hee were on earth, Hee should not bee a Priest.</p>
               <p>WHENCE WEE LEARNE, 1. That Christ is not nowe on the earth, nor in anie place thereof: and, therefore, if anie man say to vs, <hi>Loe, heere hee is; Loe, there hee is,</hi> wee must not belieue him: it is a false christ hee showeth vs, and not the True, as CHRIST himselfe fore-warneth, MATTH. XXIV.23. 2. That it is impossible, that Christ should nowe bee on the earth; for then should hee lose his Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode, which is impossible. For, if hee were on earth, hee should not bee a Priest, sayeth the Apostle
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10219:84"/>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>His Reason is</hi>; They are Priestes, which offer Giftes, according to the Lawe.

               </p>
               <p>THEREFORE, There can bee no Priest by Office on earth at all, with GOD'S allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wance.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>HEE descrybeth, the proper vse of the Leviticall Priestes, to serue vnto the Example of heavenlie Thinges. THEN,</hi> 1. The Incarnation of Christ, his Death, and the Benefites thereof, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Leviticall Shadowes, are heavenlie thinges, in regarde of their heavenlie Fruites, and Effectes, and other heavenlie Respectes; and, are with an

               <p>
                  <hi>THEN,</hi> 1. GOD would not, no, not in the tyme of Types, suffer anie devyse of man to come in, for representing anie thing heavenlie: Much lesse will hee nowe. 2. Those which himselfe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayneth, hee will haue observed, and none omitted.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>THE offering of the Typicall Oblations, hee hath made proper to the Levites. Nowe, the offering of the true Sacrifices, and service belonging therevnto, hee appropriateth to</hi> Christ; <hi>and calleth it,</hi> A more excellent Ministerie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>THEN,</hi> 1. The offering of the thing signified by the Leviticall Types, is more excellent than all their Offeringes. 2. This Ministerie is proper vnto
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:10219:85"/>
Christ onelie, in his owne person.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>From this hee preferreth the Mediatourship of</hi> Christ, <hi>to the Typicall: The Promises, and the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nane nowe, to the Covenant then.

Therefore, the Mediatour is more excellent nowe, than the typicall of olde.</p>
               <p>THEN, The offering of Christ's Bodie, which is the more excellent Ministerie, is still annexed to the Person of the Mediatour onelie. And, who-so-ever intrudeth himself<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. <hi>In comparing the Covenant then, and nowe, hee maketh this the better; Because the Promises are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. WHENCE WEE LEARNE,</hi> 1. That there was a Covenant betwixt GOD, and his Church, of olde, vnder the Lawe: And, so, Reconciliation to bee had with GOD then. 2. That how-so-ever in substance of Grace, both the Covenantes agreed; yet the forme of this Covenant vnder the Gospell, is better: Because the expresse conditions are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Promises are more spirituall, and more free of strayte conditions.</p>

                  <hi>TO cleare the abolishing of the olde Covenant, hee prooveth it, not to bee faultlesse; Because a Newe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:10219:85"/>
Covenant was promised in place thereof. Not that anie thing was wrong in that Covenant; but because it was imperfect, and all thinges needfull not expressed in it clearlie. WHENCE WEE LEARNE,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That the LORD'S proceeding with his Church, hath ever beene from the lesse perfect, to the more perfect, till Christ came. 2. That where ever GOD addeth, or altereth, what hee once did institute; by so doing, hee showeth, That before his Addition, hee had not expressed all his Mynde, as in the tyme of the Olde Testament. 3. When once hee hath perfected his course taken with his Church, as nowe hee hath done vnder the Newe Testament, hee altereth the matter no more.</p>

               </p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>In the wordes of</hi> Ierem. xxxj.31. <hi>the LORD

promiseth, to make a Covenant, afterwardes, with the house of Israell, and Iudah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THEN, 1. The partie in the Newe Covenant, is not all Man-kynde, but the Church of the Newe Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament; the spirituall Israell, and Iudah. 2. This Covenant was not brought to light of olde; but had its owne tyme of manifestation. 3. Even then, the Church was made wyse of the imperfection of the Olde Covenant; that they might learne to looke through the outward forme of it, to a better. 4. The Hope, and Too-looke, which they had towardes the Newe Covenant, helde vp their heart; that they, without vs, and our Priviledges, should not bee perfected.</p>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:10219:86"/>
they accepted the Condition.</hi> So, Albeit there was Grace heere, in sundrie Articles, covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet the forme of the Covenant, was lyke the Covenant of Workes. Compare Ierem. xvij.23. with Ierem. xxxj.31.32.33. &amp;c.</p>

               <p>Whereof wee haue to learne, 1.

That when GOD is pleased, to exercyse his Dominion, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, over Covenant breakers, the transgressour falleth in missregarde with GOD: that is, As little account is made of his lyfe, as of one without the Covenant. 3. That to bee missregarded of GOD, is the summe of all Iudgement. 4. That the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie of the people, to keepe the Olde Covenant, did not exeeme them from the punishment due to the breaking of it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THIS is the better Covenant, contayning better Promises, whereof CHRIST is Mediatour, and Suretie, vnto all them that belieue in Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein consider, 1. That all the Articles are Promises; and, so, doe requyre in the partie that will joyne in the Covenant, Fayth, to embrace the Promises; that the Covenant may bee agreed vnto on both sides: GOD promising, and the needie Sinner heartilie accepting. 2. That, what is requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Olde Covenant, as a Conditoin, is heere turned into a Promise, by GOD, in the Newe. In the Olde Covenant, hee requyred obedience to his Commaundementes: and heere hee promiseth, to wryte his Lawes in our heartes. GOD vndertaketh to doe our parte in vs, if wee will belieue in Him. 3. That the sense of Wantes, and the feeling of our

Imperfections, yea, of our heartes wickednesse, and carelesnesse, both of heart and mynde; yea, the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the inlacks, or defects, of repentance &amp; fayth, are not just hinderances, to make a soule that gladlie would bee reconciled with GOD, in CHRIST, stand abacke, from embracing this Covenant: But, by the contrarie, the feeling of sinfulnesse, in mynde, and heart, are Preparations, to fitte vs, and set vs on, to joyne in this Covenant, wherein GOD vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh to helpe, and remede, all these felt evills, through His CHRIST; by putting His Lawes in our Mynde, and wryting them in our Heartes. For, what is this else, but to illuminate our Mynde, more and more, with the vnderstanding of His Will; and, to frame our Heart, and Affections, to the obedience of the same? 4.

The revealing of Christ, and his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, vnder the Gospell, and vnder the Lawe, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as farre in measure of light, as the shadowe of a thing, and the lyuelie image thereof, drawne with all the lineamentes.

               </p>
               <p>THEN, 1. A sacrifice that perfectlie satisfieth God's justice for sinne, can not bee repeated: and, a sacrifice which hath neede to bee repeated, hath not perfectlie satisfied God's justice for the sinner, nor perfected the sinner, for whome it is offered, by
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:10219:107"/>
doing all that Iustice requyred, to purchase justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sanctification, and salvation, to him. 2.

               <p>The Apostle esteemeth this Reason so cleare, that anie man, of sound judgement, beeing asked the question, must, of necessitie, graunt it. For, Natures light doeth teach thus much, That if a sacrifice doe all that is to bee done for the sinner, it standeth there, because there is no more to doe. If it pay the full pryce of the sinners expiation, at once offering, what neede can there bee to offer it over agayne? And, therefore, if Christ's one sacrifice, once offered, perfect the commers therevnto, must it not cease to bee offered anie more, by this reasoning of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle? For, if Hee haue made a perfect purchase of what-so-ever is requyred to perfect vs, by once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, Wisdome and Iustice will not suffer the pryce of the purchase to bee offered agayne. And if Hee

So is Christ's Flesh, the Vayle of his Godhead, which did bide the Glorie of his</hi> Deitie, <hi>from the carnall beholders, who stumbled at his basenesse; and yet opened a Doore, for the spirituall man to looke in, vpon him that was invisible, whyle as hee observed the brightnesse of the Glorie of GOD, breaking through the Doctrine, and Workes, of the Man</hi> CHRIST.</p>

Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is forcible thus farre, as to bring a man into credite and esteemation, as a Saynct, before men, and vnto the common Priviledges of the Church; wherevpon, as Men, so GOD also, speaketh vnto him, and of him, as one of His People; and dealeth with him, in his externall dispensation, as with one of His owne People. In this sense all the Congregation of</hi> Israell, <hi>and everie one of them, is called</hi> holie, <hi>yea,</hi> Core <hi>also, and his followers,</hi> Numb. 16.3. <hi>The Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion internall, by renovation, consisteth in a man's sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the state of Nature, to the state of Grace; from his olde conditions, to bee a new creature indeede.

Or wee may say more shortlie: There is a sanctification by consecration, when anie thing is devoted, or dedicated vnto GOD, and a sanctification by inhabitation of the

               </p>
               <p>THEN, 1. It is vsuall for Scripture, speaking of Sacramentes, to giue the name of the thing signified, to the Signe; because the Signe is the memoriall of the thing signified. CIRCVMCISION is called the COVENANT, GENES. xvij.13. because it is the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall thereof. The PASCHALL SVPPER, for the lyke cause, is heere called the PASSEOVER, which was the worke of the Angell; because it was, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynctment, the Memoriall of it. So the CVPPE, in the LORD'S SVPPER, is called THE NEW TE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STAMENT IN CHRIST'S BLOOD: and the Bread, in the same Supper, is called THE BROKEN BODIE OF CHRIST; because it is the Memoriall thereof. 2. It is the worke of Fayth, to celebrate a Sacrament rightlie. 3. As MOSES celebrated the Passeover, in assurance, that the Destroying Angell should not touch the People of Israell; So may everie Believer bee certified, by vsing the Sacrament; That the Grace promised, and sealed in the Sacrament, shall bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed.</p>

               <p>THEN, 1. VVhat GOD doeth for Believers, is reckoned the worke of Fayth; because Fayth setteth GOD on worke, so to say, and His Power, employed by Fayth, worketh the worke. 2.

For you haue not suffered so much, as you must bee rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to suffer, Vers. 4. And you haue forgotten, that Chastisementes are Tokens of GOD'S Favour, Vers. 5.

VVee haue borne our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes Correction; and why should wee not nowe beare GOD'S? Vers. 9.

And Cowrage, to goe stoutlie on: lest by discowragement, you fall into Apostasie: But rather seeke to recover the Cowrage which you haue lost, Vers. 13. Follow Peace with all men: But Holinesse also, as you would bee saved, Vers. 14. Beware of the vnmortified Rootes of Sinne; lest they breake out in Scandalls, Vers. 15. Beware lest there be anie filthie or prophane bodie suffred among you, as ESAV was, Vers. 16. VVho solde the Blessing, for a short Pleasure, and could never recover it agayne, Vers. 17.

                  <hi>THEN,</hi> 1. Those who come vnder the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning of CHRIST'S Sheepe, are the onelie People, of whome Hee, by speciall Office, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth to take charge. 2.

It is not anough to bee given to some sorte of good worke; but wee must endevoure our selues, to worke everie sorte of good worke; having a due respect vnto all GOD'S Commaundementes. 3.
