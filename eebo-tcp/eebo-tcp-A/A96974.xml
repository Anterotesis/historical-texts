         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe leaves preſent you
with ſome ſow drops
of that Ocean of Wit,
which flowed from thoſe
two breſts of this Nation, the two <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities;</hi>
and doth now (the ſluces
being puld up) overflow the whole
Lands: or rather like thoſe Springs
of Paradice, doth water and enrich
the whole worlds whilſt the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
themſelvss are dryed up, and
that Twin-Paradiſe become deſart.
For then were theſe Verſes Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
when <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Camebridge</hi>
were <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, and a Colledge
<pb facs="tcp:116049:3"/>
more learned then a Town-Hall; when
the Buttery and Kitchin could ſpeak
Latine, though not Preach; and the
very irrational Turnſpits had ſo
much knowing modeſty, as not to
dare to come into a Chappel, or to
mountany Pulpits but their own. Then
were theſe Poems writ, when peace
and plenty were the beſt Patriots
and Maecenaſſes to great Wits;
when we could ſit and make Verſes
under our own Figtrees, and be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
from the juice of our own
Vines: then, when it was held no
ſin for the ſame man to be both a
Poet, and a Prophet; and to draw
predictions no leſſe from his Verſe,
then his Text. Thus you ſhall meet here
St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Rapture in a Poem, and
the fancy as high and as clear as
the third Heaven, into which
<pb facs="tcp:116049:3"/>
that Apoſtle was caught up: and
this not onely in the raviſhing
expreſſions and extaſies of amorous
Compoſures and Love Songs; but
in the more grave Dorick ſtrains of
ſollid Divinity: Anthems that
might have become <hi>Davids</hi> Harpe,
and <hi>Aſaphs</hi> Quire, to be ſung, as they
were made, with the Spirit of that
chief Muſitian. Againe, In this ſmall
Glaſſe you may behold your owne
face, fit your own humors, however
wound up and tuned; whether to the
ſad note, and melancholy look of a
diſconſolate Elegy, or thoſe more
ſprightly jovial Aires of an Epitha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamium,
or Epinichion. Further,
would you ſee a Miſtreſſe of any age,
or face, in her created, or uncreated
complexion: this mirrour preſents
you with more ſhapes then a Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
<pb facs="tcp:116049:4"/>
Glaſſe, or a Limnors Pencil. It
will alſo teach you how to court that
Miſtreſſe, when her very waſhings
and pargettings cannot flatter her;
how to raiſe a beauty out of wrinkles
fourſcore years old, and to fall in love
even with deformity and uglineſſe.
From your Miſtreſſe it brings you to
your God; and (as it were ſome new
Maſter of the Ceremonies) inſtructs
you how to woe, and court him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe;
but with approaches and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
with geſtures and expreſſions
ſuitable to a Diety; addreſſes clothed
with ſuch a ſacred filial horror and
reverence, as may invite and embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the moſt deſpairing condition of
the ſaddeſt gloomy Sinner; and withall
daſh out of countenance the greateſt
confidence of the moſt glorious Saint:
and not with that blaſphemous fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
<pb facs="tcp:116049:4"/>
of our new-enlightned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
men, who are as bold with the
Majeſty and glory of that Light that
is unaprochable, as with their own
<hi>ignes fatui;</hi> and account of the third
Perſon in the bleſſed Trinity for no
more then their Fellow-Ghoſt; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him as much bound to them for
their vertiginous blaſts and while-winds,
as they to him for his own moſt
holy Spirit. Your Authors then of theſe
few ſheets are Prieſts, as well as Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets;
who canteach you to pray inverſe,
and (if there were not already too
much phantasticknes in that Trade)
to Preach likewiſe: while they turn
Scripture-chapters into Odes, and
both the Teſtaments into one book of
Pſalmes: making <hi>Parnaſſns</hi> as ſacred
as Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and the nine Muſes
no leſſe religious then a Cloyſter of
<pb facs="tcp:116049:5"/>
Nuns. But yet for all this I would
not have thee, <hi>Courteous Reader,</hi>
paſs thy cenſure upon thoſe two Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of Religion and Learning, the
<hi>Uviverſities,</hi> from theſe few ſmall
drops of wit, as hardly as ſome have
done upon the late <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> three-half-penny
Catechiſme: as if all their
publick and private Libraries, all
their morning and evening watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
all thoſe pangs and throwes of
their Studies, were now at length deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
but of a Verſe, and brought to
bed onely of five feet, and a Conceit.
For although the judicious modeſty
of theſe Men dares not look the world
in the face with any of <hi>Theorau
Johns</hi> Revelations, or thoſe glaring
New-lights that have muffled the
Times and Nation with a greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
and darknes, then ever benigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb facs="tcp:116049:5"/>
the world ſince the firſt Chaos:
yet would they pleaſe bnt to inſtruct
this ignorant Age with thoſe exact
elaborate Pieces, which might reform
Philoſophy without a Civil War, and
new modell even Divinity its ſelfe
without the tuine of either Chuch, or
State; probably that moſt prudent
and learned Order of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> ſhould not boaſt
more ſollid, though more numerous
Volums in this kind. And of this
truth that Order was very ſenſible,
when it felt the rational Divinity of
one ſingle <hi>Chillingworth</hi> to be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable
twelve-years-task for all
their Engliſh Colledges in Chriſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
And therefore that <hi>Society</hi> did
like its ſelfe, whe<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> it ſent us over a
War inſtead of an Anſwer, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
us Hereticks by the ſword: which
<pb facs="tcp:116049:6"/>
in the firſt place was to Rout the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,</hi>
and to teach our two Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of Learning better manners,
then for ever heareafter to bubble and
ſwell againſt the <hi>Apoſtolick Sea.</hi>
And yet I know not whether the depth
of their Politicks might not have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
to have kept thoſe Fountains
within their own banks, and there to
have dammd them and choakd them
up with the mud of the Times, rather
then to have let thoſe Proteſtant
Streams run; which perchance may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffect
that now by the ſpreading Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verets,
which they could never have
done through the incloſed Spring: as
it had been a deeper State-piece and
Reach in that Sanedrim, the great
Councell of the Jewiſh Nation, to
have confined the Apoſtles to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and there to have muzzeld them
<pb facs="tcp:116049:6"/>
with Oaths, and Orders; rather then
by a fruitful Perſecution to ſcatter a
few Goſpel Seeds, that would ſpring
up the Religion of the whole world:
which had it been Coopd within the
walls of that City, might (for all they
knew) in few years have expired and
given up the ghoſt upon the ſame <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotha</hi>
with its Master. And as then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Pair of Fiſhermen made a Church
and caught the ſixt part of the world
in their Nets; ſo now every Pair of
Celledge-fellows make as many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſityes; which are truly ſo
call'd, in that they are Catholick, and
ſpread over the face of the whole
earth; which ſtands amazed, to ſee
not onely Religion, but Learning alſo to
come from beyond the <hi>Alpes;</hi> and that
a poor deſpiſed Canton and nook of the
world ſhould contain as much of each
<pb facs="tcp:116049:7"/>
as all the other Parts beſides. But then,
as when our ſingle Jeſus was made an
univerſall Saviour, and his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Goſpel the Catholick Religion;
though that Jeſus and this Goſpel
did both take their riſe from the
holy City; yet now no City is more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy
and infidel then that; inſomuch
that there is at this day ſcarce any
thing to be heard of a Chriſt at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
more then that ſuch a one was
ſometimes there, nor any thing to be
ſeen of his Goſpel, more then a Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher:
juſt ſo it is here with us; where
though both Religion and Learning
do owe their growth, as well as birth,
to thoſe Nurſeryes of both, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſityes;
yet, ſince the Siens of thoſe
Nurſeryes have been tranſplanted,
there's little remaines in them now (if
they are not belyed) either of the old
<pb facs="tcp:116049:7"/>
Religion and Divinity, more then its
empty Chair &amp; Pulpit, or of the antient
Learning &amp; Arts, except bare Schools,
and their gilded Superſcriptions: ſo
far have we beggard our ſelves to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
the whole world. And thus, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
Sir,</hi> have I given you the State
and Condition of this <hi>Poetick Miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany,</hi>
as alſo of the <hi>Authors;</hi> it being
no more then ſome few Slips of the beſt
Floriſts made up into a ſlender Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
to crown them in their Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and refreſh thee in thine: if yet
their very Pilgrimage be not its ſelfe
a Crown equall to that of Confeſſors,
and their Academicall Diſſolution a
Reſurrection to the greateſt temporall
glory: when they ſhall be approved of
by men and Angels for a choſen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
a Royal Prieſthood, a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
People. In the interim let this
<pb facs="tcp:116049:8"/>
comfort be held out to you, <hi>our ſecluded
Univerſity-members,</hi> by him that is
none; (and therefore what hath been
here ſpoken muſt not be interpreted as
out of paſſion to my ſelf, but nicer zeal
to my Mother) that according to the
generally received Principles and Ax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioms
of Policy, and the ſoundeſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the moſt prudential States-men
upon thoſe Principles, the daie of your
ſad Oſtraciſme is expiring, and at an
end; but yet ſuch an end, as ſome of
you will not embrace when it ſhall be
offered; but will chuſe rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
Peripateticks through the whole
world, then to return, and be ſo in your
own Colledges. For as that great
Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> had a Form and
Concluſion altogether contrary to the
expectation and deſires of them that
procured it; ſo our great Councels of
<pb facs="tcp:116049:8"/>
               <hi>England</hi> (our late Parliaments) will
have ſuch a reſult, and Cataſtrophe,
as ſhall no ways anſwer the Faſts and
Prayers, the Humiliations, and
Thanks givings of their Plotters and
Contrivers: ſuch a reſult I ſay, that
will ſtrike a palſie through Mr. <hi>Pims</hi>
aſhes, make his cold Marble ſweat;
and put all thoſe ſeveral Partyes, and
Actors, that have as yet appeard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our tragical bloudy Stage, to an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
ſtand and gaze: when they
ſhall confeſs themſelves (but too late)
to be thoſe improvident axes and ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
in the hand of a ſubtle <hi>Workman;</hi>
whereby he was enabled to beat down,
and ſquare out our Church and State
into a Conformity with his own. And
then it will appeare that the great
Worke, and the holy Cauſe, and the
naked Arme, ſo much talked of for
<pb facs="tcp:116049:9"/>
theſe fifteen years, were but the work,
and the cauſe, and the arme of that
Hand, which hath all this while rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
us over the <hi>Alpes;</hi> dividing,
and compoſing, winding us up, and
letting us down, untill our very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
have ſet and tuned us to ſuch
notes, both in our Eccleſiaſtical, and
Civill Government; as may ſooneſt
conduce to that moſt neceſſary Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niſon and Harmony, which is
an eſſential part of Chriſts Church
here upon Earth, and the very Church
its ſelfe in Heaven. And thus far,
<hi>Ingenuous Reader,</hi> ſuffer him to be a
Poet in his Prediction, though not in
his Verſe; who deſires to be known
ſo far to thee, as that he is a friend to
perſecuted Truth, and Peace; and
