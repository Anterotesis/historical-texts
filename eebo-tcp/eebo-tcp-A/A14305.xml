         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For <hi>the worlds great Thunderer</hi> hauing lately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto him my deare <hi>wife</hi> by a sulphureous dampe of <hi>lightning,</hi> and shaken some part of my house with a <hi>thunder-clap,</hi> hath likewise strooke
<pb facs="tcp:14310:3"/>
me with such an amazement in mine vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, with beholding out of my tabernacle of flesh and bloud the glorious gleames of his power, that truly I must needs confesse my selfe to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what backward in penning and painting out this handy-worke of his, almost as ominous to me, as his <hi>hand writing</hi> was to <hi>Balthasar</hi> in <hi>Babylon.</hi> To this I may adioyne multitudes of impediments as well of publike causes and suites abroad, as also of mine owne priuate affaires at home. All which concurring vpon me in confused heapes, some by importunitie of office, some of necessitie, and some by Sathans suggestion commmonly euery day since that fatall blast, caused such vnpolished points, as in the reading may occurre to your learned view.</p>
            <p>And yet for all this, Right honourable, I had not so abruptly at this time hastened on mine abortiue worke to your presence, were it not, because I would stay betimes the forward steps of <hi>Sathan,</hi> and also because I would stop the vnpure mouthes of pratling <hi>Momes,</hi> and tatling <hi>Niobes,</hi> who <hi>inter Bacchanalia</hi> amidst their pots of drinke, their pipes of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and idle fits of iollity establishing the shallow foundation of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports vpon the flying and lying rumours of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>libellers,</hi> doe blasphemously blaze abroad to the derogation and preiudice of the powerfull <hi>Lord of lightnings,</hi> that the <hi>Diuell</hi> our spirituall <hi>Tempter</hi> acted this terrible tragedie.

            <p>Againe, there is not wanting a sort of suspicious <hi>Critickes,</hi> who arrogating to themselues the gift of Prophesie, or reuelation from aboue, doe make a taunting table-talke of this heauenly visitation in lieu of a grace or salt to season their meates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, by attributing this vnexpected chance to some secret sinnes of hers.

In like sort, there be two kindes of persons: the person of his Spirits Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:14310:16"/>
and the person of his Spirits properties. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or being of his Essence is but one, the persons or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistences of the properties be three distinct, euery one a Spirit by himselfe, euery one a liuing <hi>God</hi> by himselfe, and yet all one Spirit, one liuing <hi>God.</hi> The Father, or the first speaker, is <hi>God</hi> by himselfe and of himselfe, and therefore the first being or person. The Sonne or word is <hi>God</hi> by himselfe, and not of himselfe, but of the Father or speaker onely, and therefore the second being. The holy Ghost, or holy loue, is <hi>God</hi> by himselfe and not of himselfe, but ioyntly of the Father and the Sonne, and therefore the third being. There is no difference at all betweene the <hi>Speaker,</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> and this <hi>Loue,</hi> but onely in the recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call relation of one to another: for in respect of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing &amp; beginning, which was coeternall before al worlds, before all times or termes of times, they are one essential, one equall, and one transcendent Person. But in respect of order in their heawenly <hi>Hierarchies,</hi> of their offices, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, and effects, ordayned among themselues by their owne diuine decrees, and also in respect of the three records on earth, or sacramentall types and mysteries of <hi>water, the word, and the Spirit,</hi> there are said to be <hi>three, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, which beare record in heauen:</hi> three persons distinguished really in respect of their personall properties, but indistinct essentially in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their perpetuall power.

                  <hi>thou wilt, O Father.</hi> And so the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> is inferiour to them both, in regard of his humble function of vice-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencie or deputation in comforting and instructing the sinfull sonnes of <hi>Adam.</hi> These seuerall assignements of offices they appointed to themselues in their owne praedestinated wisedomes; wherein though they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire, yet (as I said before) one of them hath the name of Primate, in regard of order, but in regard of their eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and omnipotence, none is greater or lesse then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For this cause it is written, that the <hi>Father</hi> created the world, the <hi>Sonne</hi> redeemed it, and the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth it: and yet they are but one in effect, in their ends one <hi>God,</hi> one omnipotent power communicating to three persons, to three properties, as one center to three lincs, all in all and three in all. <hi>As no man can come to the Father, but by the Sonne,</hi> so no man can come to the <hi>Son,</hi>

               <p>To returne and retire backe towards the entire es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> I beleeue that <hi>Gods</hi> properties, as I <note place="margin">4</note> wrote before, cannot be diuided into parts, portions, or parcels: but that euery quality in <hi>God</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> and the whole substance of his spirit: and so the <hi>Speaker</hi> in <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit, is <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit, of the whole substance. The <hi>Word</hi> in <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit, is <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit of the whole substance. But herein is their difference, that the <hi>Father</hi> is the <hi>Speaker</hi> onely, as begetting the <hi>Word:</hi> the <hi>Sonne</hi> is the <hi>Word</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as the <hi>Word</hi> begotten. And the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> is <hi>holy</hi> only, as proceeding from the mutuall loue, and from the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall wils of the <hi>Father,</hi> or the <hi>Speaker</hi> begetting, and of the <hi>Sonne</hi> or <hi>Word</hi> begotten: So as the <hi>Speaker</hi> in <hi>God</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> in <hi>God</hi> is <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>holy Loue</hi> in <hi>God</hi> is <hi>God.</hi> But yet the <hi>Speaker</hi> is not the <hi>Word,</hi> nor the <hi>Word</hi> the <hi>Speaker,</hi> if we regard the order and mysterie of their operatiue offices, though both be <hi>God:</hi> for the one is the <hi>Father</hi> begetting, and the other, I meane, the <hi>Word,</hi> is the <hi>Sonne</hi> begotten. The propagatour or producer of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification</hi> or <hi>holy Loue</hi> in <hi>God</hi> is loue, which loue is <hi>God.</hi> And loue produced in <hi>God,</hi> is Loue, and is <hi>God;</hi> but the producer of loue, is not loue produced, I say, the will of the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne,</hi> being the producer of loue, is not the loue proceeding or produced, that is, the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> though all be <hi>God</hi> in substance and power, but differing in the manner of their operation: for the <hi>Father</hi> is loue onely, as transferring loue to the <hi>Sonne;</hi> the <hi>Sonne</hi> is loue, as transferring loue to the <hi>Father;</hi> and the <hi>holy</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:14310:18"/>
                  <hi>Ghost</hi> loue onely, as it is transferred, produced, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from them both. Thus the whole <hi>Trinity</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the substance of loue, agree all together in one: for euery one of them partaking of one <hi>Godhead,</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes also of the attributes thereof, of loue, of wisdome, and others; onely they differ in the order and maner of their loues, or of their wisedomes productions. In like maner, the <hi>Father</hi> is wisdome ontly, as begetting or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing wisedome; the <hi>Sonne</hi> is wisedome onely, as wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome begotten or produced of the <hi>Father;</hi> and the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> is wisedome, as it is produced from the ioint and mutuall will of the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne;</hi> so that wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is not the <hi>Father</hi> as it is wisedome, but as it is wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome begetting or producing; neyther is wisedome the <hi>Sonne</hi> as it is wisedome, but as it is wisedome begotten and produced of the <hi>Father;</hi> nor is the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as it is wisedome, but as it is wisedome produced or proceeding from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne.</hi> Whereby good <hi>Christians</hi> may note the manner of the difference, how that loue producing, loue produced of the <hi>Father,</hi> and loue produced both from the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Sonne,</hi> be three distinct things. And so are wisedome begetting, wisedome begotten, and wisedome proceeding, three personall properties, distinct in the relation of one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, though indistinct in respect of their essence and eternity. To wind vp this discourse in a word; when I pray to the <hi>Father,</hi> I pray with feare, fearing his iustice; when I pray to the <hi>Sonne</hi> I pray with hope, hoping for mercy; when I pray to the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> I pray with admiration, admiring <hi>Gods</hi> loue, in mitigating the seuerity of iustice, with the sweete streames of mercy towards the penitent sinner, through the spirituall apprehension of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> crucified.</p>

               <p>While he liued on earth (which, as some write, was <note place="margin">2</note> three and thirty yeares) he laboured (like a woman with childe) with our infirmities, but after a Diuine maner. He was ambitious: but how? Ambitious onely to aspire vp into the Theater of the Crosse. He was affected with concupiscence: but with what concupiscence? Not with sinfull, but with celestiall concupiscence. He was affected, but not infected; for he onely longed and lusted after mans saluation. O <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> how willingly would hee haue gathered together thy strayed young ones, euen like a carefull henne, hadst thou repented! Hee was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry: but how? Not to reuenge; for he requites good for euill, and prayes for his very foes: Onely hee was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry without sinne for zeale sake, <hi>ad detestationem peccati, non ad vindictam.</hi> He was enuious; but in what sort? Not <hi>ex vitiata natura,</hi> of corrupt nature, but for consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake, that the <hi>Diuels</hi> kingdome became daily aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented. He was ignorant of some things; for he knew not of the <hi>day of Doome:</hi> but his ignorance was simple and not sinfull; harmelesse and not erronious, in desiring curiously to know those secrets, which did not befit the <hi>Sonne of man</hi> to know. He was troubled with feare in his agony: but with what kinde of feare? Not with feare of death satisfactory, to repaire that breach betwixt the <hi>Angels</hi> and vs; but with naturall feare, which impaires the animal faculties, according to the nature of mans sensitiue appetite, which trembles at the sense of terrible torments. In this maner <hi>did he take vpon him our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> not by way of inherent spotting, but by way of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary <note place="margin">

Whereunto I might adde the tendernesse, softnesse, and delicatenesse of his body; which being materially formed onely of a pure Virgins nature, without coniunction of the male substance, could not but feele such tortures more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uously and gripingly then any other. What shall I speake of other sensible motiues, of his agonies, the treachery of <hi>Iudas,</hi> whose feete he disdained not to wash but a little before, the <hi>Iewes</hi> ingratitude, and aboue all, his <hi>Fathers</hi> anger in iustice heaped vpon him for our misdeedes, thoughts, and vaine wordes?

But to returne vnto mine owne opinion, whereto I will not binde others (the same being no matter essential of faith) I am of the minde, that the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> of Heauen, in the beholding of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> do know ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things here on earth, especially, the estate of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected fellowes.

When our mindes are sanctified through stedfast saith intentiuely on <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as the diseased <hi>Israelites</hi> became healthfull with regarding <hi>the brasen Serpent,</hi> we may assuredly affirme that we do know him.

Thirdly, his knowledge hath beene reuealed by <hi>the Holy Ghost</hi> to <hi>Moyses, Samuel,</hi> the Prophets, and lastly by the <hi>Messias</hi> himselfe, through apparitions, miracles, lawes, ceremonies, and temporall blessings. Fourthly, to draw neerer vnto mans capacitie, which depends most vpon sensible obiects; mention is made by <hi>Moyses,</hi> how <hi>God caused him to stand in the caue of a Rocke, and putting his hand vpon him he did shew him his hinder parts, not suffring</hi>

Thus <hi>God</hi> sometimes speakes naturally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our naturall apprehension.</p>
               <p>In conclusion, let it suffice our curious braines, that <hi>God</hi> is a powerfull <hi>Spirit,</hi> not to be felt palpably with <note place="margin">5</note> mens hands, nor seene with mens eyes (I speake not of <hi>Christs</hi> glorified body being humane, which <hi>Thomas Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus</hi> felt after his refurrection) by reason that the <hi>light</hi> of his <hi>Spirit</hi> is too conspicuous, glorious, and ouer-bright for such weake, terrestriall, and brittle senses.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14310:36"/>
faith, patience, and other vertues inspired these seruants of <hi>God,</hi> whom his Wisedome selected and sealed to that degree of sanctification, as the potters vessels, for such honourable seruices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Contrariorum cadem est ratio.</hi> By the knowledge of Goodnesse, let vs gather the knowledge of the opposite, <note place="margin">3</note> how the Diuell by his spirituall <hi>Nuncioes</hi> of Sinne, as by <hi>Detraction,</hi> malice, and such others, possesseth the negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> not with reall formes, but with spirituall suggestions and spiritual operations. <hi>God</hi> turnes away the influence of his countenance from his degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate children; then <hi>Sathan</hi> embraceth that aduantage of opportunity, and with his pestilent breath bloweth into the principall parts of mans body and soule. He impoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth the humours of melancholy, choler, and gail, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenometh the lodge of imagination: then the possessed is sranticke or lunaticke. The bloud and seede he tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and tainteth with honied lechery, and hateful luxury: then the patient becomes passionate in his body, prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall of his bloud and seede, and proude of his supposed power. For how can it otherwise be, when the body is tempted to receiue into it superabundance of iuyce, of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate meates and drinkes? Must not consequently e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery naturall body vent out what is supersluously gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red within it?</p>
               <p>But, O thou great <hi>Gouernour</hi> of the world, whose will is vnsearchable! no mortall man can mortifie his longing <note place="margin">4</note> conceits, his lustfull concupiscence, without the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his body by fasting, neither can he mortifie his body by fasting, without powring out many piteous peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before the seate of thy mercy. Nor yet can man (O sinfull man) powre out his petitions intentiuely before thee, except it were giuen him from aboue, and except he were in his conscience compelled by the operation of thy <hi>spirit,</hi> to craue daily for perscuetance in his prayers and petitions.</p>

To finish the abouesaid point of <hi>Sathans</hi> stinging, whether these plaguy temptations be verily, or figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely, <note place="margin">5</note> the <hi>Diuels</hi> spirituall power, or the <hi>wrath of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed in vials,</hi> as is allegorically specified in the <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps,</hi> it is hard for man to iudge; for both might well be inflicted on vs, seeing <hi>the vngodly is a sword of his,</hi> and <hi>Nabuchadonozor</hi> is termed <hi>his seruant,</hi> or executioner to <note place="margin">

Euen so it fares with these turbulent spirits: well may we ayme at their mediate manner of infections; but it is a very difficult matter to discourse iudicially of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate stinging.

               <p>For all this curious braines will not leaue off plodding <note place="margin">2</note> and practizing of profound problemes. Why (say they) did <hi>God</hi> fashion man of such a brittle State? Wherefore made be not all men of the same manners and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Why did he create man so imperfect of such a tender ticklish forme? O foolish fondlings, who are ye that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to dispute with <hi>God?</hi> Was it not enough for your soules to be shaped after his <hi>Diuinity,</hi> both in <hi>vnity</hi> and in <hi>Trinity,</hi> with absolute and electiue power to slie from the wrath to come? I tell you, there was no reason, that petulant children should possesse all their Fathers goods. Which of you I pray, will disrobe himselfe of his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall glory, or diuide it with your inferiours? Worldly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates can endure no corriuals, nor by their good wils any equals. And should <hi>God</hi> share with his creatures his most soueraigne perfection, which they could aswell mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, as <hi>Phaet on the chariot of the Sunne?</hi> But to yeeld some satisfaction to your curiosities, I beleeue that <hi>God</hi> framed man after this manner for two respects:</p>
               <p>First, because that the creature might differ from his <hi>Creator,</hi> who alone is perfect. The soule therefore must <note place="margin">3</note> content her selfe with that vocation, which <hi>God</hi> hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited vnto her. Seeing that she knows her owne weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, she must not presume on her imperfect strength; seeing that she hath experience of errours, she must
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14310:45"/>
wholy with feare and trembling relie on the mercy of <hi>God,</hi> who like a tender mother, attendeth on his crazed creature, and like a milde Phisician, out of her relapse worketh an <hi>Antidote</hi> to preserue her from falling. She may be shadowed because she is not <hi>God,</hi> but she can neuer be extinguished, because she came from <hi>God. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test obumbrari, quia non est Deus, extinguinon potest quia est à Deo.</hi> Well may we stumble, but through the Grace <note place="margin">Tertul. in. l. de Animá.</note> of <hi>God</hi> we rise vp quickly. We may be as blacke as jet, but as true as steele. We may be blacke, <hi>but yet comely, as the Tents of Cedar, and as the curtames of Solomon.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cant:</hi> 1.</note> Though we be rebellious by nature, yet we may be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate by faith. Though we be excommunicated, we may be absolued by the mediation of our Sauiour <hi>Christ,</hi> and obtaine againe our former simplicitie and state of freewill, which in that first golden age, and time of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memory we most wilfully lost. Though we be but babes, we may grow vp to be perfect men in strength and vnderstanding, and so at last to a greater measure of sanctification. Though we enioy not perfection, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toyce in our redemption. And though our mindes in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall faculties do follow the temperature of our bodies, yet in supernaturall speculations we abandon &amp; abhor it.</p>
               <p>Another reason why <hi>God</hi> created man so imperfect (if I dare call him so) was, because that mans soule, like mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall <note place="margin">4</note> eyes, which cannot behold the Summers Sunne at noone; or like the Owle, which is bedazeled with the day-light; I say, because the soule being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ncarcerated and enchamed in the massie substance of the flesh, was not capable of that excellent perfection. Therefore we must not impute our imbecillity and imperfection to Gods want of power or impotency, but to his vnsearchable will (who after <hi>Adams</hi> creation left him to himselfe, <hi>puris naturalibus,</hi> to the capacity of his owne nature) and to our owne earthly Tabernacles; which could not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate, by reason of our weakenesse and wantonnesse of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14310:45"/>
flesh and bloud all the glorious attributes of the <hi>Deity.</hi> For this cause did Christ descend into the flesh with low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of spirit, and not with lofty glory. So that his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> as himselfe answered <hi>Pilate, was not of this</hi>

                  <hi>world.</hi> For this cause the Israelites could not away with the <hi>Lords</hi> lightning thunders, and glorious voyce on <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> but requested <hi>Moyses</hi> to stand betwixt them. <hi>Let not God talke with vs,</hi> said they, <hi>least we die.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.</note> For this cause S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote to the Corinthians: <hi>I gaue you milke to drinke and not meate, for you were not yet able</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor. cap.</hi> 3.</note> 
                  <hi>to beare it, neyther yet now are ye able: ye are yet carnall;</hi> Nay such is our sottishnesse, that we endeuour not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto a glimpse of the <hi>Lords</hi> glory: we presume vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon delayes: we procrastinate the time, and neuer care for mortifications of the flesh, being the ladder to heauen and chiefe meanes to obtaine faith, loue, and charity at the hands of God. <hi>A Preacher is but a bookish fellow: Sanctification is but curiosity: to doe well or ill is allone.</hi> Thus doe the sinfull sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> trust too much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to predestination, as though they were made priuy of <hi>Gods</hi> inuestigable will. But to winde vp the trueth in a word, <hi>the preaching of Christs crosse is foolishnes vnto them that perish, but vnto them, which are saued, it is the power of God, and wisedome.</hi> As there is no foole to the olde <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</note> foole: that is, to the worldly selfe-wise; so contrariwise there is no wisedome comparable to Christian simplicity, which through faith thinkes it enough, that God calles him to his Court, though not to his Councell.</p>

To this purpose it will not be immateriall, if I insert a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiue conceit of mine, wherewith I was vnfainedly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of late: Vpon <hi>Sunday night,</hi> being the <hi>fourteenth day of Ianuary last,</hi> 1609. I fell into a deepe study con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>our knowledge of good and euill,</hi> procured by the <hi>Infernall Snake.</hi> I lamented mine owne weakenesse of nature, that multitudes of sinnes should treade and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple downe my <hi>Christian</hi> vertue. I sorrowed in spirit, that I could not free my soule from worldly concupiscence. At the last, after much striuing and strugling, the <hi>Lords</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable speech to St. <hi>Paul</hi> came into my minde, <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee.</hi> Whereupon considering my <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</note> repenting heart, I resolued, that <hi>God</hi> suffered me to be thus buffeted and beaten with Sardonicall sinnes, because I might acknowledge mine owne imbecillity, and submit the same to the perfection of <hi>Christ,</hi> the propitiation for sinnes, who alone is Righteous and Holy. For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this meditation, I was strongly assisted by this vnfained dreame. On that very night I dreamed, that I lay vpon the floore without stockins or shoes, and suddenly me thought one warned me, that I should looke vnto my selfe, for a Snake lurked very neere me; with which words being affrighted, I bestirred my selfe, and beheld the said Snake about a yard or more in length,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14310:46"/>
almost crept vnder me; whereupon I vehemently cried for helpe to him, that warned me therof: who presently, as it were in a moment, with a weapon, which he had in his hand, hewed the Snake in three or foure pieces. For all that, I was not deliuered from seare, I doubted his stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging part; but he which smote him willed me in any case not to feare, by reason that his sting was of no sense, now that he had chopt him in pieces. With that I might see a smoake or breath arising out of the Snakes diuided body. At which straunge sight, I prepared to hasten me away, lest this smoake being infectious, should (like a pesulence) empoyson my body: But notwithstanding all this my preparation, before I could get together my stockins and shoes, which were the impediments of my remoue, the smoake ceased on a sudden. Whereupon I bewayled somewhat with my selfe, that I went no sooner away from that poysonous smoake, or smoakie exhalation, and because I preferred such trisling impediments before the security of my life; which I imagined to be in some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, by reason of that my small stay.</p>
               <p>Charitable Reader, pardon me, if in rehearsall of this dreame I disquiet thy delicate minde; notwithstanding that our whole life is little better then a dreame. No man liuing can attribute lesse credite, then I doe, vnto dreames: yet neuerthelesse, forasmuch as now and then it pleased God to reueale secrets and things to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his seruants by dreames, as sometime he did vnto <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi> and <hi>Nabuchadonozor,</hi> we must not altogether neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to make reasonable vse of them. As for example, The man which admonished me, I compare to our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>Christ,</hi> who of his vnspeakeable mercy towards man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde defendeth vs (while we prostrate our selues in all humility, as in my dreame I lay vpon the floore) from the <hi>Hellish Snake,</hi> who watcheth daily to vndermine our wils. And yet though his Godhead hath trodden vpon <hi>Sathans</hi> head, he permits him for his glory, for our triall,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14310:47"/>
and also for some satisfaction of his iustice, to enuenom our humane willes, by reason of our tarditie and remist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in his seruice, but certainly afterwards he embraceth his Elect again. And, like as I plaied loth to depart w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> my stockins and shoes, for al that I saw the imminent danger of the poysonous Snake; so doth mankind attend to the toyish bables and triuiall fables of this world, while <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> bruizeth our worldly heeles, and casteth out of his mouth whole floods of spirituall venome, to surround and surprise our spirituall part with passions of enuy, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, fury, and other infections, whereof the smoakie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation of my dreamed Snake, might well be the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Image and <hi>Idaea.</hi> And the rather I am inrooted in this opinion, because I know my reasonable will to be oftentimes tainted with the said spirituall smoakie ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome, as I supposed in my dreame that I suckt the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, palpable, and sensible smoaky poyson of the mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Snake into my corporall breath.

as yet more simple then the man, as a creature formed somewhat after the man, and consequently of lesse expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and of lesse perfection. But what gainest thou? Thy <hi>spirit</hi> limited to thy former home of darkning errors, and thy fatal instrument metamorphozed into a sneaking Snake, to creepe vpon the earth, as thou didst creepe into his wit, and into the womans conscience. This is the righ: reward of disobedience, which afterwards <hi>Lots wife</hi> receiued, though in some different manner. For her bodily forme was changed from a woman into a pillar of salt, like as the <hi>Serpent</hi> was conuerted from the comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est shape among beasts, into the most contemptible crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which this world affoords; I say, a creature, a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous creature in generall wordes, for a speciall or speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficqe name can no <hi>Logician</hi> rightly attribute vnto a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> which is fully growne.

This kinde of writing is the reflecting I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of those two Testaments, <hi>into whose</hi> despised <hi>corps the spirit of life after three dayes and a halfe entred,</hi> whose validity is so vehement, that they bring downe flouds of bloud from heauen, yea, and many sortes of plagues and vengeance vpon all malicious mortals. Likewise there is a prophane kinde of writing, seruing onely as the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>knowledge of euill,</hi> for taunts and temptations fraught with Satyricall scoffes, with scurrility, with <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi> sports, with amorous allurements, deuised by the Diuell for the replenishing of his Kingdome, and for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen euidence of condemnation against the reprobate before the grand Iurie of Heauen at the latter day. The former kinde of writing hath but small amity and alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with flesh and bloud; it is spirituall and proceedes from the inward man. Hee that reades a booke of this stile and stampe, shall neuer hunger nor thirst: It heateth the heart, it healeth the passions, it quickneth the spirit, and (like the Sunne) disperseth the thickest cloudes of sinfull nature. The other kinde of writing communicates with flesh and bloud, causeth men (as malefactors) to shun the light, to liue in the darkesome valley of death and damnation; and being like brute beastes, bereaued of reason and Diuine knowledge, it makes them aliue to be enrowled in the Calender of the Dead.</p>
               <p>Out of both these kindes there flowes a mixt or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

For man hauing lost his originall happinesse, was left here on earth to so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iourne in a middle State betwixt heauen and hell. With this mixt moralitie, <hi>Plato, Plutarch, Pliny, Seneca,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pagan Philosophers were endowed, to the end that <hi>Gods</hi> mercy might be the more glorified, and that the <hi>Gentils</hi> should be inexcusable in their conuersions, when they were confuted by their owne rules. For euen as his Omnipotent <hi>Maiesty</hi> vouchsased out of his magnificence to bestow a speciall priuiledge and prerogatiue vpon the <note place="margin">4</note> 
                  <hi>Israelites, to annoint them with oyle of gladnesse aboue their fellowes,</hi> to direct them by extraordinary meanes, to feed them with <hi>Manna,</hi> with the purest bread: So at length by reason of their hardnesse of hearts, out of his meere mercy sithence towards the Gentiles, hee sent the Sunne-shine of his grace, to enlighten their <hi>Horizon</hi> by such ordinary and mixt morall meanes included in their owne bookes to introduce them to the knowledge of Goodnesse, to the reading of the Scripture, which (as I said before) is the reflecting image and inferiour light; so that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> enioy the same at the second hand, as crummes reiected and relicted by the luxurious <hi>Israelites.</hi>

Verily, the iudgement is iust: that they should be ledde into temptation, and become attentiue to lies and libels, because they glorified not his hallowed name, nor listened to the words of truth, whereby they might be saued.

               <p>Touching Defamations determinable in the <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Court,</hi> it was resolued in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> betwixt <hi>Palmer</hi> and <hi>Thorpe,</hi> according to the right learned colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Sir Edward Cooke Knight, Lord chiefe Iustice</hi> of the common pleas, <hi>en le quart part de ses reports,</hi> that such defamations ought to haue three things incident. First, that they concerne matters meerely spirituall and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable in the Ecclesiasticall Court, as to call a man <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke, Schismaticke, Aduowtrer, Fornicator, &amp;c.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they must concerne matters meerely, and onely spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all; for if such defamations touch any or some thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable at the common Law, the Ecclesiastical Iudge shall not take knowledge thereof. Thirdly, although that such defamations be meerly and onely spirituall, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding he that is defamed cannot sue him there for amends and damages, but the suit ought to be onely for the punishment of sinne, <hi>pro salute animae,</hi> for the soules health. And for the first and second, which is incident, the case <hi>en</hi> 2 2. <hi>Edward.</hi> 4. 20. was recited to this effect.</p>
               <p>The Abbot of S. <hi>Albons</hi> sent his seruant for a woman couert to come and speake with him. The seruant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Masters commaundement. And thereupon the woman came with him to the Abbot. And when the Abbot and the woman were together (the seruant which knew his Masters will) retyred from them, and left them together in the chamber alone. Then the Abbot said vnto the woman, that her apparel was grosse and course; to which the woman answered, that her apparell was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her ability, and according to her husbands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. The Abbot knowing in what things women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their delight, replied vnto her, If she would be ruled by him, that she should haue as good apparell as any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in that Parish, and sollicited her chastity. When the woman would not consent vnto him, the Abbot assaulted her, and would haue made her a lewd woman against her
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14310:93"/>
will; the which the woman would not suffer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Abbot detained her in his chamber against her will, to the entent, &amp;c. The husband hauing notice of this abuse done to his wife, spoke of all this matter, and said, that he would haue an action of false imprisonment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Abbot, for that he had imprisoned his wife; vpon which the Abbot adding one sinne to another, sued the innocent &amp; poore husband for defamation in Court Christian, because the husband had published that my Lord Abbot had sollicited her chastity, and would haue made her a naughty woman. But vpon all this matter dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed to the Kings Court, the husband had a <hi>Prohibition,</hi> by reason that the husband might haue had an action at the common law, for this affault and imprisonment of his wife; although then at the first he had not any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor peraduenture at any time would haue had. Yet because the scandall determinable in the Ecclesiasticall Court, was vpon all the matter being disclosed, mixt with a matter determinable at the common law; for this cause vpon motion made by the Abbots Councell to haue a <hi>consultation,</hi> in this case that was denied him by the Court.</p>
               <p>For the third point, which is incident, <hi>viz.</hi> That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed cannot sue for amendes and damage in Court <note place="margin">3</note> Christian, though it be meerely and onely spirituall. It was enacted <hi>Articul. cleri. cap.</hi> 1. 2. &amp; 3. that the Kings <hi>Prohibition</hi> should hold place, if a Prelate enioyned a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance pecuniary to any man for his offence, and it were demaunded. Notwithstanding if Prelates enioyne a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance corporall, and the party will redeeme such penance by money, if the money be demaunded before a Iudge spirituall, Prohibition shall hold no place. But leauing the Statutes at large to be considered by the Reader, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to know them, I will returne to the Reports of that rare Treasurer of the common law <hi>Sir Edward Cooke,</hi> for words of detraction actionable, and forth explanation
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:14310:93"/>
of the Ecclesiasticall power in such cases.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 35. <hi>Eliz. Anne Dauies</hi> plaintiffe declared, that she was a Virgin of good fame, &amp;c. Whereas one <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Elcocke,</hi> Citizen and Mercer of London, of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and value of three thousand pounds, desired her for his wife; and for that cause had communication with <hi>Iohn Dauies</hi> Father of the said <hi>Anne,</hi> and was ready to conclude it: <hi>Iohn Gardiner</hi> defendant <hi>(premissorum non ignarus)</hi> to defame the said <hi>Anne,</hi> and to distaste the said <hi>Anthony</hi> from proceeding forward, vttered and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the said <hi>Anne</hi> these wordes: <hi>I know Dauies daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter well,</hi> mentioning the said <hi>Anne, she dwelt in Cheapside, and there was a Grocer that did get her with childe.</hi> And being admonished by some that were present and heard him, that he should be aduised what he spoke of the said <hi>Anne,</hi> he said further of her, <hi>I know very well what I say, I know her father, mother, and sister; and she is the youngest sister, and had the childe by the Grocer.</hi> By reason of which wordes the plaintife was greatly defamed, so that the said <hi>Anthony</hi> vtterly refused to take her to his wife. To this the defendant pleaded not guilty, and by a <hi>Nisiprius</hi> in the County of Buckingham the Iurors found for the plaintiffe, and assessed damages to two hundred markes; Then it was moued in arrest of iudgment by the Counsel of the defendant, that the said defamation of incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie concerned the spirituall and not the temporall iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. And therefore as the offence should be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in Court Christian; so the remedy for such defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought also to be there. For <hi>cognitio causae non spectat ad forum Regium.</hi> Euen so, if a man be called a Bastard, an Heretique, a Miscreant or an Aduowterer (because they appertaine to the Ecclesiastical iurisdiction) no acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lies at the common law. But it was answered by the plaintiffes counsell, and resolued by the whole Court, that the action was main teynable for two causes: first because that she was punishable by the Statute, <hi>de</hi> 18. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:14310:94"/>
cap.</hi> 3. if she had a bastard. And although that forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or aduowtry be not examinable by the common law, for that they are done in secret, and peraduenture are vncomely to be openly examined; yet neuerthelesse the hauing of a bastard is a thing apparant, examinable and punishable by the said acte. Secondly it was resolued, that the action was maintainable if the defendant had char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the plaintiffe but with bare incontinencie. For in this case the ground of the action is temporall; that is, shee was to be aduanced in marriage, and that she was defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of it, and the meanes whereby she was defeated, was the said slaunder, which meanes tending to such an end, should be tried by the countrey.</p>
               <p>So if a Diuine be to be presented to a Benefice, &amp; one to defeat him of it, saith to the Patron, that he is an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique or a Bastard, or that he is vnder excommunication; whereby the Patron refuseth to present (as he might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, if the imputation were true) and, hee loseth his preserment, he shall haue an action vpon the case for the scandals tending to such an end.</p>
               <p>Likewise if a woman be bound, that shee shall liue continent and chaste; or if a lease bee made vnto her, <hi>Quamdiu casta vixerit,</hi> as long as she remaines chaste, in these cases incontinency shall bee tried by the common law. <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> betwixt <hi>Banister</hi> and <hi>Banister,</hi> it was resolued, where the defendant speakes of the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe (being sonne and heire to his father) that he is a Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard, an action lies vpon the case; for that tendes to the disinhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">1</note> The meaning of words is twofold, mild and rough, or vncharitable: and words are alwaies to be accepted in the milder sence.

Secondly, the <hi>Defendant</hi> charged not the <hi>Plaintiffe</hi> with <hi>swearing</hi> or <hi>forswearing,</hi> for he might obtaine a Manour by <hi>swearing</hi> and <hi>forswearing,</hi> and yet he did not procure nor assent vnto it. Also, words which maintaine an action must be directly applied to the <hi>Plaintiffe</hi> in regard of the damage, which he sustained by the scandall.</p>
               <p>If one impeach another, that he hath forsworne or <hi>periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> himselfe; that beares no action for two causes.

not maintaine an Action. For <hi>Boni Iudicis est lites diri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere.</hi> It is the part of a good Iudge to take away strife, and causes of strife. But if one speakes to another, that he <hi>is forsworne or periured</hi> in such a case; for such words the Action is good, because that it appeares by these words, that hee hath forsworne himselfe in iudiciall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>

                  <hi>Sir Christopher Wray Lord Chiefe Iustice</hi> said, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though slaunders and false imputations are to be repres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <note place="margin">7</note> for that many times <hi>à verbis ad verbera perue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tum est,</hi> from words men come to blowes; yet he said, that the <hi>Iudges</hi> haue resolued, that Actions for scandals must not be maintained by any strained construction or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor must they extend any fauour for their support. Seeing they abound in these daies more then in times past; and the intemperance together with mens malice encreaseth. <hi>Et malicijs hominum est obuiandum.</hi> They must meete and preuent mens malice. Besides in our Law Bookes, Actions for scandalles are very rare; And those which are reported are for words of eminent slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and of great importance.</p>
               <p>This moued the <hi>Court of the Kings Bench</hi> to denie a <hi>Procedendo</hi> to haue an Action of slaunder for calling one <note place="margin">8</note> a <hi>whore,</hi> tried in <hi>London.</hi> For the <hi>Defendant</hi> had remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it thence by an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> into that <hi>Court.</hi> And it was affirmed by the whole <hi>Court of the Kings Bench,</hi> that a custome to maintaine actions for such brabling speeches is against law. <hi>Licet consuetudo sit magnae au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatis, nunquam tamen praeiudicat manifestae veritati.</hi> Although that custome be of great authoritie, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing it doth neuer preiudice manifest truth.</p>

               <p>In euery Action vpon the case for slaunderous words, two things are requisite: first, that the person which is <note place="margin">11</note> scandalized be certaine. Secondly, that the scandall be apparant by the words themselues. And therefore if any one saith without any precedent communication, that <hi>one of the seruants of I.

As he <hi>is sick of the pockes the French pockes,</hi> this <hi>innuendo</hi> and itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the same wordes makes not the proper office which it ought; for it contends to extend the generall words being the <hi>Pockes</hi> to the <hi>French Pockes</hi> by an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of an intent, which is not apparant by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent words, whereto the iteration might be referred. And the words themselues must be construed <hi>in mitiore sensu,</hi> in the milder sense. To conclude, 42. <hi>Eliz. en Bank le Roy entre Iohn Iames, Pl. &amp; Alexander Rutlech Def.</hi>

it was so resolued that the office of an <hi>innuendo</hi> a reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is to containe and designe the person himselfe, or the very word which was certainly named before, and in effect was in place of a <hi>(praedict)</hi> the aforesaid thing, or the aboue named person. But a reiterating or repeating cannot make a person certaine, which was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine before, for it would be an inconuenience, if actions were maintained by an imagination of an intent, which appeareth not by the words, vpon which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is founded, but all is vncertaine, and subiect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueable coniecture.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Iudge</hi> must note the very words of <hi>Detraction,</hi> whether they be <hi>Adictiues</hi> or <hi>Substantiues,</hi> for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">12</note> 
                  <hi>Adiectiues</hi> will maintaine actions, and somtimes not. They are actionable, first, when the <hi>Adiectiue</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth an act committed. Secondly, when they scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize any in his office, function or trade, whereby he gets his liuing.

Sometime the very sudden talking about such strange apparitions in the nights doth produce a sudden alteration in our vnsetled minds, and the rather, if we know our selues guiltie of some deadly sinne, as of adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, malice, or such like. Yea, <hi>Papists</hi> by reason of their superstitious legends, which their <hi>Confessours</hi> and graue Fathers haue so firmely euen with their nurses milke im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in their thoughts, I say, these credulous people by Gods iustice are confounded with ridiculous toyes, &amp; otherwhiles with their owne conceit, according to that, <hi>They feared where no feare was.</hi> Because they stop their eares from hearing the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and shut their eyes from reading the truth, therefore doth <hi>God</hi> send such light things to terrifie their vnrighteous hearts.

               <p>Others haue beene put to great feare by looking on shining worms, on bones of newland fish, or on a kind of rotten wood, which shine very bright in the night time.</p>
               <p>Some againe haue trembled in their beds at the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den rumbling and noyse, which Cats, Rats, or Mice haue made in searching for their prey: or at the stirre and coile which disguised sprights haue caused. Many pageants haue beene practised with the benefit of the night to the great terrour of them, that were not very wise: some haue wrought wonders, by walking on the water vpon stilts, I meane vpon deepe waters, as others haue walked with large soles of corke.</p>
               <p>I haue likewise heard of some Conicatchers that went currant for <hi>Coniurers,</hi> who to gaine themselues estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among fooles, haue purposely in the fields placed in a darke night creuises or tortoises aliue with burning candles on their backs, onely to make them beleeue that they were creeping Diuels.</p>

The spirit of fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood made him beleeue, that <hi>holy water</hi> and <hi>masse-</hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring would chase away the <hi>Diuell,</hi> if it were a <hi>Diuell.</hi> At <hi>Pont y Musson</hi> in <hi>Lorraine</hi> it was my hap to meete with the said diseased Gentleman in an <hi>English</hi> Priests house, where he soiourned, his friends expecting his deliuerance by the Spirit of illusion, by vertue of the <hi>Masse</hi> and of the <hi>sanctified water.</hi> But all the fat fell in the fire, and he poore Gentleman left still vncured, hauing formerly bin bound in a cradle, besprinckled with <hi>holy water</hi> in time of <hi>Masse,</hi> and so continued bound for three dayes together in the Church. A most fearefull vsage, able to driue a whole man out of his wits. His friends hearing at length that the matter fell not out correspondent to their expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they sent him to <hi>Padua</hi> for the tempering of his braine, by the Phisitians of the body, where I met him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with his <hi>Curator,</hi> who told me the whole businesse and circumstance, and how the spirit would not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged for all their holy water. Now their generall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion was, that eyther it was a stubborne <hi>spirit,</hi> vnremoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by exorcismes, or else the patient was sicke with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme choler or melancholy.</p>
               <p>Likewise to confirme their false doctrine with false miracles by the <hi>Diuels</hi> instinct, they coined many ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and such as the eares of the <hi>Elect</hi> would glow to heare. These fopperies, as treacherous spirits out of <hi>the woodden horse of Troy,</hi> our subtle <hi>Sinons</hi> coniure vp for worldly respects, and chiefly, lest their <hi>Pontificiall</hi> purple robes or scarlet habites be altered to another colour of a baser graine. Among many <hi>miracles</hi> in their lying Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends, they recorde, that a <hi>Religious woman</hi> hauing put a sanctified hoast into her hiue of Bees to make them fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in steed of increase found a little Chappell of Hony and Waxe built in the hiue, with doores and windowes, with an Altar, with a Steeple of Belles, and also that the Bees had laid the hoast vpon the Altar, with melodious

noise flying round about it.

And for their concealements he beates this ambitious lesson into our <hi>Canonists</hi> heads, that <hi>it is sacriledge to reason about the Popes deedes, whose murthers</hi> (say they) <hi>are excused like Sampsons, whose thefts like the Hebrewes, whose adulteries</hi>

               <p>After mens deathes the <hi>Diuell</hi> eyther by himselfe, or <note place="margin">2</note> by his agents, wicked worldlings, seemes to appeare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the person of a <hi>Samuel,</hi> and will not be coniured back without such <hi>Popish</hi> bables; thereby setling his Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in their reprobate natures. But most of all I cannot but wonder what phantasie possesseth men, when they publish miraculous lies, derogatory to their credites, that be liuing, and able in their liues time to retort the whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone vpon them. Surely I can deuise none other excuse on their behalfe, then that such miracles of strange sights were inuented by them of Diuellish policy, to make their profession famous among the simple, and on the other side to withdraw the <hi>Protestant</hi> from the true worship of God. As for example; the Diuell forseeing, that by <hi>Luthers</hi> preaching he was like to lose many of his guests, euen in <hi>Luthers</hi> life time, soborned one of his false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to set out a booke in print of <hi>Luthers</hi> death. The same very day when <hi>Luther</hi> died (as this <hi>Homeromastix</hi> reported) many that were possessed of Diuels in a towne of <hi>Brabant</hi> (which lay distant from the place where hee was supposed to die, aboue three hundred miles) were suddenly deliuered, and not a long time after repossessed againe. And when it was demanded of the Diuels, where
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14310:109"/>
they had beene? They answered, that by the appointment of their <hi>Prince</hi> they were called forth to <hi>Luthers</hi> Funcral. Which likewise was proued to be true, because a seruant of <hi>Luthers,</hi> that was in his chamber when hee died, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the casement to take the ayre, saw a great number of vgly Spirits hard by the window, leaping and dancing. Afterwards when <hi>Luthers</hi> body was laid in his graue, presently there arose a tumultuous noise and terrible sound, that the earth seemed to moue. The next night after they heard a louder noise then before about his Tombe. For which cause in the morning they opened his Tombe, where in stead of his corps they found but a foule fauour of brimstone.</p>
               <p>The copie of which Pamphlet, when <hi>Luther</hi> read, he subscribed these wordes: I am sory that <hi>God</hi> is iniuried by this fiction. Otherwise I can but smile at the <hi>Diuels</hi> malice, wherewith he and his complices the <hi>Papists</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue me. It is strange to see with what impudence these iugling Priestes dare diuulge such a notorious lie of him, whom his owne neighbors and Countreymen know better then they or any other forrainers. This I can te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, that throughout all <hi>Germany,</hi> where I trauelled, his memory is blessed, his birth-day solemnized, and himselfe reputed for a second <hi>Elias.</hi> But (as I said before) our Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Euchanters in policy inuented this fable for the glory of their <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> which God peruert like <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophels</hi> deuises.</p>
               <p>Hereby we gather, that most of our <hi>Countrations,</hi> lying miracles, and foolish fables were deriued from the <hi>Papists</hi> for the corrupting of the simpler sort, and that of right <hi>Coni-catchers</hi> are termed <hi>Conturers,</hi> and wizards witches. Onely they differ in this, that the <hi>Cont-catcher</hi> and Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard receiue their knowledge by an infolded or implicite suggestion in their braines from the Diuell; and that the <hi>Coniurer</hi> and Wtich reape with the Diuels sickle more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly; yet both of them ioyne in the effect, to deceiue

would coniure out the theefe. Whereby we may note the scarcity of true Witches, that in very deed indent with the <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Heretofore in time of Popery, masters of families in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, that the <hi>Fayries</hi> haunted Butteries and Cellers, onely to make young people affraid of sitting vp late in the night.

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:14310:115"/>
sonne and he were forced to sell the said house, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that Sprights in the nights vsed there to haunt and to molest them. Let this suffice for the discouery of our common witchcraft, and sorceries: Now I must shew the validity of our ordinary coniurations, exercised onely by learned men, which iump with the vnlearned in the main, namely, in deceit.</p>
               <p>Two substantiall Yeomen about twenty yeares since hauing lost plate &amp; other moueables, and desirous to be acquainted with the theese, resorted to a Colledg in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, where meeting at the gate with a needy scholer, they enquired of him for such a mans chamber, whom foolish fame had canonized in their credulous eares, for a notable Coniurer. The Scholer in outward appearance somewhat graue, after a few questions, circumstances, and verball complements, tolde them that he was the man. But for satisfaction of their requests, he tooke them priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aside, declared vnto them the danger of the law, if it were knowne, and coyishly, like a cunning queane to her youthfull nouice, seemed to repell their suits. They loth or perhaps not daring to returne homewards to their wiues, without some notice touching the stolne goods, vrged him more instantly to cast a figure, and rather then faile to coniure vp a spirit, that they might learne who was the theefe. At last with some adoe, the scholler in respect of his pouertie, resolued to make a purchase of these vnlooked for guests, and to that end first requiring their oath of secrecy, like a true Chymist, willed them to resort within three houres of night, to a chamber remote from company. The honest men with pure protestations thanked his grauity, and went home to their Inne with gladsome hearts, iudging each houre a day, til the prefixed time drew nigh. In the meane space the adulterate Coniurer calles vnto him more good fellowes, boone companions, confederates with them, that about such a time they should likewise repaire to the designed cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:14310:115"/>
with a whole Cutlers shop of weapons, as Proctors and Officers, to apprehend both the Coniurer and his mates. Well, the appointed time approached, the good Yeomen missed not to come thither, where also the Coniurer met them, lockt fast the chamber doore, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing prepared afore hand a great Caldron full of hote scalding water on a good fire, caused them to cast their money therein, for feare lest the spirit might annoy them, by reason of such prophane trash. His commaundement stood for a law. Assoone as he had fashioned his Circle, crossed it, and inuocated on these terrible spirits:</p>

               <p>In stead of spirits, the false <hi>Proctors</hi> bounced and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the doore, menacing to breake it open, if out of hand they opened it not. The poore men not aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to budge one inch from the center of the Circle, without their money, and now without hope of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration among strange Officers, stood amazed in a quanda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And with that in a faigned vehement rage, charged them vpon their allegeance to follow them towards the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The liuer-hearted Yeomen very dutifully obeyed, went along with them, all the way begging for grace and fauour, with large promises of golden mountaines, and with faithfull assurances of millions of prayers for their prosperity. The pitifull <hi>Proctors</hi> ouercome at last with their important suits, and knowing their money to be lest behinde safe in the hote Caldron, let fall the raines of their rage. Their iustice became mitigated, their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority relented, vpon condition, that these honest men
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:14310:116"/>
would assume on their credite to come againe vnto them the next morning, which they faithfully promised. But being arriued at their lodging, they tooke counsell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to giue the Proctors the slip, and leaue the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurer, to goe to the gallowes alone, without their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.

After that he had discouered his malady to the said <hi>Vignier,</hi> he presently knew that it was a sickenesse of the spirit, and for that he loued very well this kinseman of his, he deuised and aduised with himselfe how to helpe him. For this purpose both of them resolued to goe together to <hi>Paris:</hi> and there they addressed themselues vnto <hi>Monsieur Poena,</hi> who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly vnderstood what sickenesse it was, to wit, that the patients imaginatiue faculty was hurt and depraued, and also counselled them that they should looke for spirituall
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:14310:116"/>
remedy for that spirituall sickenesse; which likewise the said <hi>Poena</hi> promised that he would endeuour to get for his recouery. Hereof the diseased partie was very glad, and pressed on him very hard, that he should hasten him, telling him withall, that his said spirits continually mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to kill him, or to torment him with some grieuous sickenesse. Here the Phisitian was faine to vse strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems and subtilties to take away these wicked impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of the sicke-mans phantasie, in regard that the party being learned, and very speculatiue (as all melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike men are) would comprehend by reason the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his cure, which after many circumstances in briefe was thus: The Phisitian tooke vpon him to fashion in a little booke certaine characters and names of spirits, and to make as though he must coniure vp a stronger spirit then those which were in his body; by whose forcible means the lesser spirits should be chased therehence. The remedie was plausible to the sicke man. In the meane that all things were accommodating and making readie for the said exploit, the Phisitian ministred vnto him pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to tame and moderate the humour of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie.</p>
               <p>Atlength the time approached that this feat should be put in practise. There was a great Hall chosen out for the nonce, wherein this saigned coniuration should be made: for the effecting whereof, an honest Chirurgion was appointed to act the person of the pretended spirit. All things thus prepared together with the Circle and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ceremonies, which Negromancers vse in such a case, they came to the place, where the possessed party was seated in the midst of the Circle: and to blindfolde him the more, he was encouraged not to be astonished at what accident soeuer that should befall. After some counterfeit whispering, crossing, and inuocations, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>South</hi> was called vp, who appeared not. Then the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>East</hi> was called, who likewise
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:14310:117"/>
came not. In the end at the third call the Chirurgeon that lay hid in a certaine place there for the nonce began to appeare in this hall, that was somewhat darke. And then the Patient was againe comforted and counselled more then before, not to be affraid, who answered, that he was resolued not to feare at all. So earnestly did he attend and repose confidence and hope in this illusion. At last the matter passed so finely and luckily, that the poore <hi>Patient</hi> beleeued that this spirit, which he tooke to be no fained one, had power to ouercome and chase out of his body the other two spirits, which he imagined to be there inclosed. So that this plot serued to strengthen his imagination, and to weaken his former false perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This was the principall remedy of his malady. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse the said <hi>Monsieur Poena</hi> desisted not for all that during the space of a moneth after, to minister vnto him certaine medicinable things to purge and asswage melancholy; insomuch that at the moneths end being throughly purged and cured of his sickenesse, the party acknowledged himselfe abused, and was very much asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of this false imagination, which for a long time had possessed and troubled his spirit.</p>

soule in durance. And if you doubt any thing (quoth he) we will trie. Walke you about ten of the clocke anon by the bridge, and you shall heare a pitifull groaning. Take vnto you what company you please, so you shall heare the safer and more certaine. After supper <hi>Poole</hi> made as though he went on hunting. About the time mentioned, the <hi>Priest</hi> walking to the place, heard wofull lamentations, which <hi>Poole</hi> very cunningly fained, being there hidden in a bush, complayning out of an earthen potte, broken for the nonce for that purpose. The <hi>Priest</hi> within a litle while after returned homwards, longing to tell what he had seene and heard. There he tolde <hi>Poole</hi> (who came home somewhat before him a neerer way) what was done, and likewise some thing more of his owne deuising, because the matter might be the more wonderfull. At the last <hi>(Poole</hi> egging him on) he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to coniure the <hi>spirit</hi> therehence. All that night he slept not, with musing which way he might sasely bring the matter about, for hee feared and doubted very sore of himselfe. Therefore hee gathers together most preualent Exorcismes, ioyning others vnto them of his owne inuention, as, <hi>By the bowelles of the blessed Virgin Mary. By the bones of Saint Winifride.</hi> The next day he chuseth a place in the plaine, neere to the bush; from whence hee heard the voyce. There, he frames a very large <hi>Circle,</hi> with innumerable crosses and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. By his side hee sets a vessell full of <hi>Holy water.</hi> About his necke hee wore a holy robe, at which hung the <hi>New Testament,</hi> besides an <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> which was wont to be consecrated by the <hi>Pope</hi> once a yeare. With these hee armes himselfe, for feare lest it might be a wicked <hi>Spirit</hi> that would assault him. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther durst hee commit himselfe alone to the <hi>Circle,</hi> but determined to ioyne another Priest with him. Then <hi>Poole</hi> fearing lest the mysterie might chance to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayed, if he got vnto him one craftier then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:14310:118"/>
discloseth out of hand the whole story to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Priest a friend of his, and ioynes him assistant to the simple <hi>Canon</hi> in the acting of his conceited Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie.</p>
               <p>All things thus prepared, the <hi>Coniurer</hi> with the other Priest about ten of the clocke enters into the circle. <hi>Poole</hi> that went before him, cried lamentably out of the bush. The <hi>Canon</hi> talles to his exorcismes. But <hi>Poole</hi> to haue the more sport shifted him therehence, and by and by returnes with afriend of his, but on two blacke steeds, throwing fire at the <hi>Canon</hi> to haue him out of the circle. The next morning the <hi>Canon</hi> bragged how he preuailed against the spirits, who appeared on two blacke horses, how they were very like to draw him out of the circle, and how he sent them away with a vengeance by means of his forcible charmes. The next night the <hi>Coniurer</hi> better encouraged returnes into the circle, and <hi>Poole</hi> with his cópanion on their blacke horses shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with a terrible noyse, as though they would breake into the circle, and with a long rope, which they brought with them, drawen along the ground, they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrew both Priests with their vessell of holy water to the ground, and at last seeming to quaile at the charms, they departed away for that night. This done, the <hi>Canon</hi> comes homes, tels <hi>Poole</hi> what great danger he es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, and how valiantly he ouercame both the wicked spirits; now he certainly perswades himselfe that no <hi>Diuell</hi> is so cruell nor so impudent as to breake into his Circle.</p>
               <p>Thus farre proceeded the fable, when by chance <hi>Pooles</hi> sonne in law a young man delighted with such kinde of mirth came thither. Him <hi>Poole</hi> makes priuie of their stage play, and appoints him the soules or spirits part to act. The young man apparrels himselfe with a sheete like a coarse, and carries with him quicke coales in a pot, which through the sheete seemed as it were
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:14310:119"/>
lightening. At night they goe to the stage play, where the soule pitifully bemones himselfe. The <hi>Canon</hi> dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth all his forcible coniurations, like volees of Canon shot, vntill at length the <hi>soule</hi> by the bush shewes it selfe, sometimes gliding with fire; sometimes miserably groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Assoone as the <hi>Canon</hi> required the spirit to declare who he was, <hi>Poole</hi> suddenly in a diuellish shape, and with a counterfeit roaring leapt out of the bush, saying to the <hi>Canon,</hi> Thou hast no right in this soule, it is mine, and with that runnes to the very bounds of the circle, as if he were about to assault the <hi>Coniurer,</hi> who on the other side fought lustily with his exorcismes, and liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sprinkled him with holy water. But heere fell out a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty iest. As the <hi>Coniurer</hi> busied himselfe in this manner, the <hi>Diuell</hi> exclaimed, that he cared not a rush for all his charmes, for thou hast dealt with a wench (quoth he) thou art mine: which words though <hi>Poole</hi> spake but in merriment, yet it seemed that he hit the naile on the head, by reason that the <hi>Coniurer</hi> toucht with that saying hastened out of hand into the center of the circle, and whispered, I know not what confession into the other Priests eares. But <hi>Poole</hi> ouerheard the Priest enjoyning him penance, namely, to repeate ouer three <hi>Pater no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi> Which accomplished, the <hi>Canon</hi> more fiercely and furiously returnes towards the meeres of the circle, and voluntarily dares and defies the <hi>Diuell,</hi> who now fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning himselfe fearefull fled backe, saying, Thou hast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled me, if I had bene wise, I had not forewarned thee. Then after the departure of the <hi>Diuell,</hi> began a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the <hi>Canon</hi> &amp; the <hi>soule.</hi> The <hi>Canon</hi> coniures him vpon paine of damnation) to tell him what he is, who readily answeres him, that he is a <hi>Christian</hi> mans soule. After these and the like speeches the soule seeing him very in quisitiue, and least he should smell out the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, craued pardon for that night, with promise that he would returne the next night after vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:14310:119"/>
Thus the <hi>Canon</hi> and the soule for a few nights com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned together, the summe grew to this passe. The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurer</hi> asking, whether there were any meanes for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> torments, the soule answered, that he might be deliuered from torments, if the ill gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> money, which he left behinde him, were restored backe. What (said the <hi>Canon)</hi> if this money were dispursed by good men, and conuerted by them to godly vses? yea, that would auaile me, quoth the soule. Here, the <hi>Coniurer</hi> exhilarated with ioy, demanded, how much the summe amounted vnto. The soule answered that the summe was great, and verie profitable for him, that it was so. He named the place, but farre distant thence, where the treasure lay hid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground, withall he prescribed to what vses the said money should be employed, first, that there honest men vndertake a pilgrimage, one to <hi>S. Peters</hi> Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> the other to <hi>S. Iames</hi> of <hi>Compostella</hi> in <hi>Galicia,</hi> the third to <hi>Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then his will was, that a great number of <hi>Psalmes, Masses</hi> and <hi>Dirges</hi> be celebrated in certaine monasteries <hi>pro salute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimae</hi> for his soules health. The ouerplus which remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the <hi>Coniurer</hi> should defray, as he thought good. Now all the <hi>Canons</hi> mind was occupied about the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and the dispose thereof. All his thoughts ranne v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this vnexpected prey, he talked of no other subiect in discouse. In all companies, at ordinaries he promised magnificent rewards to Monasteries, and spake of no base matters at all. He went into the place, found the signes, yet durst he not digge for the treasure, because the soule had giuen him a knot in a rush to vndo, that it might redound to his great perill, if he touched the treasure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so many Masses were accomplished. Already many of the wiser sort smelt out the iest: Insomuch that sundry of the <hi>Canons</hi> friends admonished him in secrete to take heede, lest the world might conceiue sinisterly of his worth, which had beene generally reputed before for a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14310:120"/>
very wise man. Neuerthelesse the <hi>Canon</hi> continued re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in his beliefe, hoped as true as his Creed to see the matter sort out well to his liking. Which imagination so throughly possessed the mans mind, that beside sights and spirits he dreamed of nothing, he spake of nothing. The habit of his mind appeared in his face, which became so pale, so extenuated, so directed, that a man would take him for a Ghost, and not a man. He wanted but little of being out of his wits.</p>

Which ouer curious search I do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly vndertake for the better satisfaction of busie brains.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:14310:132"/>
In this Labyrinth I humbly desire his heauenly <hi>highnesse</hi> to dispence with my haughty purpose, for certainly (if it were possible) men should not question of such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found matters, but rather they should be drawne backe to the humility of not thinking once thereon, lest that chance vnto them which chanced to the presumptuous Angels, or lest the answere of that ancient <hi>Father</hi> iumpe iust vpon their phantasticall pates, who being asked by a curious-headed fellow what <hi>God</hi> did before this worlds creation, gaue him this choaking answer, he made (quoth he) Hell for such curious persons as you are. An humble ignorance (I confesse) in such waighty mysteries is no way preiudiciall; but the peremptory deniall of any one of them is blame worthy.</p>
               <p>This world is a miraculous map or a table booke, wherein the mysteries of <hi>Gods</hi> nature are deciphered, so <note place="margin">2</note> that it is impossible for any man to know the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thereof. Therefore we must content our selues with admiration, which is a thing most acceptable to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. To verifie this, looke O mortall man, vpon the azu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red skie, and tell me what thou seest? <hi>Admiration.</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend into the earth, and take thy iourney from the East vnto the West, from the North vnto the South, and after all thy trauels, after all thy trials tell me what thou sayest, nay what thou sawest. <hi>Admiration.</hi> Well, seeing that the vastnesse of this worlds circuite doth so confound thy weake and wearied senses, that the more thou musest, the more thou maruellest: then enter into thy little world into thy self, and comprehend thy thoughts within a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine circle. <hi>O quàm durus est hic sermo.</hi> This is a heauier taske. At the least and last, looke downe vpon the little Ants, and learne what moues them to toyle and take more care to liue by their own labours then many a man. Surely, thou canst not but admire. And why? because this world and all the workes therein are the <hi>Idea,</hi> the modell, the mappe, the booke, wherein the nature of the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:14310:132"/>
incomprehensible <hi>Godhead</hi> is written with capitall let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Admiration.</hi> In euery thing both great and little, how little and light soeuer it be, his <hi>Diuine Maiesty</hi> hath imprinted his wisedome, goodnesse, and power. And euen as in his substance he is all, so in his workes he doth all.</p>
               <p>And now to declare what <hi>God</hi> did before the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, it is certaine, that his purpose was to haue a society of men as well as of Angels, and those good and euill Angels, that the one might serue as monuments of his mercy, the other as monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his iustice, and that both together might serue as instruments of his glory; for his power is no lesse glorified in the one then in the other. After the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his purpose, for mens sake, that they might haue a place correspondent to their natures, he drew the platforme of this world. Wherein these principall things concurred, first his purpose, next his wisedome, thirdly his goodnesse, fourthly his power, fiftly his generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, sixtly, his particular predestination. To returne backe towards the first, which is his purpose or intent: There is the map of all the world, and of euery thing to be done there throughly contriued in his minde before the beginning of his worke. Then his wisedome, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and power animated him to go forwards, and to prouide for the building of his new place of plantation or world, for as then there wanted a mediate or second instrument to worke vpon. Wherefore he was driuen to create all of nothing, that is, without any second meanes without the assistance or aduise of any other. In this creation he vsed the helpe of his <hi>word</hi> onely, that was his omnipote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t selfe, whom the naturall Philosophers other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise termed the <hi>first mouer</hi> or supreme cause of all things. There was no power in his Angels, for they were but creatures themselues, hauing their motions by his very motion. In the power of his onely will and motion it
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:14310:133"/>
consisted to create the essence of the materiall substance of the world. And so he made heauen and earth, and by vertue of his Spirit he breathed life, forme, or motion into them, and into all the creatures thereof, so that all things were in the compasse of sixe daies enlightened, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished, supported and sustained by the motion of his powerful spirit, yea all things, the firmament, the planets, starres, meteours, elements, and all other creatures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, were vnited with such a perfect vnion that they make vp a perfect globe, map, or booke, of his neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough-admired nature; And which is most miraculous to mans capacity, euer since that he moued them, they continually moue one another by different motions &amp; do effect all things in this world eyther for generation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, or destruction according to his supreme dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Some moue one another by necessary or fatall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Some by voluntarie motions, some by casuall motions, some by naturall motions: eyther slow or swift. What good things come to passe, we are to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to himselfe, who is the first mouer of all these moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But what euill things come to passe, we must ascribe to the second motions, which are voluntary and vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by him: I say, we are to ascribe euill things to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond causes, that we detract not from his omnipotence in making him the immediate cause, or in affirming that they proceeded without his consent. For as goodnesse comes from his wil: so euill cannot come against his will, but by his sufferance and permission it comes from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarie motions.</p>

Neither yet constraines he any of his second causes to commit good or euill by any forcible operation or necessitie of nature, but by disposing vnto effects su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to their seuerall conditions: Whereby both good and euill actions shall flow out of the said second causes according to their owne dispositions, euen as a voluntary quality proceeds from a voluntary cause, and a casuall quality from a casuall cause.

               <p>Though God foresaw before the ground worke of the world was laid, that such and such might be saued: yet notwithstanding he knew in his wisdome that they could not by reason of their affections, and of themselues with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his assistance, attaine to that perfect state. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he interpoled his mercy together with his iustice, he sent his owne spirit among them incarnated to ease them of that grieuous yoake which flesh and bloud found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable, whereby he foresawe that men might please him, if they were endowed with as much free-will, as they might chuse for their enabling

thereunto. To this end he inspired some with faith, and some he reiected: yet with this caueat and condition did he predestinate them to faith, that this faith should serue as a badge or cognizance to discerne them from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate; so that their election being conditionall, they should not waxe presumptuous, cowardes, nor <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus all our actions, all our goodnesse, all our misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, yea and our liues, willes, and destinies are subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate without coaction or constraint vnto <hi>Gods</hi> directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whose supreme will being aboue our willes, and flowing into our willes, takes not away the iudgements of our vnderstanding, nor enforceth vs, but so ruleth vs, that we in chusing or refusing doe somewhat follow our owne reasonable willes. For he that made vs, without vs will not sanctifie vs without vs, that is, without our cooperation and consent. Much lesse can the influence of the Starres or Meteours induce a necessitie of destinie, and master our complexions without our consent. The very beginning of all our operations was infused by our <hi>Creator</hi> in our selues with freedome of will. So that no constellations or meteours, if being corporall substances they triumph other whiles ouer our bodies by <hi>Gods</hi> dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet cannot they sway our mindes, because they are diuine, spirituall, and of a purer substance then themselues.</p>
               <p>And surely they are strongly possessed with the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Errour,</hi> which ascribe the cause of their damnation imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly <note place="margin">4</note> vnto <hi>Gods</hi> ineuitable decree, for the certainty of his decree doth no way force them of necessitie to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or damned, as they please. And though the intent of <hi>God</hi> himselfe be certaine and immutable, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the meanes of bringing the effects of saluation or damnation to passe, doe not proceede from necessarie but from voluntary motions: for <hi>Gods</hi> prouidence or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight, which as I wrote in the former discourse, is alwaies

Weercupon, he ordained eternall rewards and eternall punishments for them. As for example, a man sicke of a <hi>Calentura</hi> or burning ague is charged by his Physition not to drinke wine. The patient notwithstanding the strictnesse of his charge by reason of his continuall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, and former disordered life carouseth wine, and dieth. Which that Poet well remembred:</p>

               </l>
               <l>In drinking wine the panges of death</l>
               <l>From him the cup do wrest:</l>
               <l>His members quake, his teeth doe shake,</l>
               <l>His life can finde no rest.</l>
               <p>Now the cause of this mans death was himselfe, for if he had obeied the Phisitian he had recouered his health. After this fatall accident we cannot denie, but it might haue otherwise hapned, but the thing being once done, we certainly know it was done, and what was done must needs be done: for now it cannot be vndone. Howbeit that in the doing or drinking of the wine, the sicke par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might haue chosen whether he would drinke it or no. So in our actions concerning saluation or damnation, there is no necessitie or restraint, but we may chuse in time whether we will be saued or no, neither ought we iustly to accuse <hi>God</hi> for our damnation if we be damned, or blame his immutable and ineuitable decree, but lay the fault where it ought. Seeing that <hi>God</hi> is content, that his will should concurre with ours, let vs lay the fault on our stubborne selues, who through a customarie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:14310:136"/>
in sinning haue wittingly and wilfully deserued it. For his diuine Maiesty to free himselfe, did tender his grace to all, &amp; euery man might by acceptance there of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid the punishment, &amp; flie from the wrath to come, if he would; so that it is not the necessitie or constraint of <hi>Gods</hi> decree, which inferred our damnation, but our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Gods</hi> commaundements, which albeit we need not commit, vnlesse we would: yet being once commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted must needs be committed; which his prouident Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie perceiuing thus to proceede and chance as alreadie proceeded and chanced, decreed eternall reward for the righteous, and eternall punishment for the reprobate. Concerning this last point, we may iustifie the certaintie of his decree. But to charge his Prouidence with the occasion of our sinnes, as by the necessitie of his decree, is damnable; for it is one thing to enquire whether <hi>God</hi> knew that such and such would be damned; and another thing to enquire whether he forced them to sinne, and so to worke their owne damnation. And it is another thing to affirme, that <hi>God</hi> knowing such and such would sinne according to their natures did decree eternall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment for them.</p>

Neither ought we to maruell or murmure at this, that we be not all called &amp; chosen, considering what was our beginning, our fragility, our stubborne natures, and that we deserued no fauour at all. Seeing our first Parents both man and woman tasted the fruite of <hi>good and euill,</hi> it is but discreet seuerity, or rather diuine mercy, that thy soueraigne <hi>Maiestie</hi> electeth some (as <hi>good</hi> persons) of their seede to honour thee, and leauest the rest (as <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill)</hi> to their owne appetites in satisfaction of thy iustice.

For the solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this triuiall and idle question, it is written, that the Potter may ordaine his owne vessels to what vse himselfe pleaseth.

Commonly he suffereth euill to chance by that meanes as he bringeth goodnesse to passe, extolling his owne glory out of their errours, and in effect his sufferance of euill is nothing

else but his destination and decree of goodnesse. So that the cause of mens reprobation proceeded not from the ordinance of <hi>Gods</hi> will, but from their owne willes by <hi>Gods</hi> sufferance.</p>
               <p>In a word, it is not good to be ouerbusie with this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall purpose of <hi>God;</hi> for it is the marke of a Reprobate <note place="margin">4</note> to intrude himselfe ouerboldly into the secrets of his <hi>Maker.</hi> Let vs then modestly content our selues with the <hi>Apostles</hi> Counsell: <hi>I say (through the grace that is</hi>

               <p>It is not long since <hi>Paules</hi> proudsteeple ouercrowing all the spires in <hi>England</hi> felt the blowes of diuine iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice with her sister <hi>Babell;</hi> the one by lightning, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by confusion.</p>
               <p>One <hi>Wyman</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Glocester,</hi> as many there yet liuing can testifie, about fortie yeares past, hauing a son called <hi>Arthur Wyman</hi> at the Vniuersitie in <hi>Oxford,</hi> very earnestly required another sonne of his, one <hi>William Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> to carry some prouision of victuals vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Whitson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to his said sonne in <hi>Oxford.</hi> This younger sonne, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many excuses, was at the last forced vpon that high day <hi>nolens volens</hi> to go forwards on his iourny to <hi>Oxford.</hi> But by the way in a thicket of wood he was found stricke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dead with lightning: yet his body in outward appearance was without any marke. The mare whereon he rode was also smitted dead, and sauored very strong of brimstone. And the meat which he caried, as Kid, Lamb, &amp;c. were so corrupted with blackish sent, and stunke so ill fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly, that no man could abide the smell thereof.</p>
               <p>Mistresse <hi>Lowbell</hi> a Gentlewoman of <hi>Colchester</hi> yet liuing, about two and twentie yeares ago or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts was sodainly stricken downe with lightning, and so scorched and singed in her bodie with the sulphureous slame, that she could hardly be cured within a quarter of a yeare after.</p>
               <p>About the said time at a place called <hi>Croes-Askurne</hi> in the Countie of <hi>Carmarthen,</hi> vpon the day of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans marriage, as they were making merry there, a very strange accident hapned. There came a thunderbolt, and pierced quite through the said house, and also a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine womans head-tires were rent and torne from her head with a blast of lightning at that instant, without any other harme.</p>
               <p>Likewise about that time a whole houshold at a place
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:14310:142"/>
called Talley in the said Countie, were burnt with wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire. There perished at that time by report fiue or sixe little children in the said house. Whereby it appeares, that the innocent is sometimes smitten with such strange ends aswell as nocents.</p>
               <p>There was a fearefull lightning on the seuenteenth day of Nouember 1606. which in very short time burnt vp the steeple of <hi>Bleachingley</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> and in the same melted into infinite fragments a good ring of Belles. Which accident, because it was so lately done, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse the same more at large, according to the discourse of one <hi>Simon Harward,</hi> who wrote thereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiously and learnedly. When I came (quoth he) to visite the towne of <hi>Bleachingley,</hi> I found their cause to be equall (if not worse) then the rumour or report, which was before published: I found that by the lightning (which came with the terible thunder on Munday being the seuenteenth of this instant Nouember, about ten of the clocke in the night) the spire steeple of the said <hi>Blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chingley,</hi> hauing beene lately new couered to the great charges of the parish, in three houres space was vtterly consumed with fire. The steeple was about twelue fade me high aboue the battlements of the square stone worke: but it was a steeple spreading downeward very large in circumference. The same worke which bare it (being also about twelue fadome high) is a long square of one and twentie feete one side, and eighteene feete the other side. It is thought by good workemen, that two hundred loades of timber will not suffice for the erecting of such a steeple, as that stoneworke did late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beare.</p>
               <p>I found also the belles (being before a sweete ring, and so large, that the Tenor waighed twentie hundred waight) partly melted into such fragments, and partly burnt into such cinders, or intermingled with such huge heapes of cinders, as it will neuer heereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:14310:143"/>
serue to the former vses thereof.</p>
               <p>This lightning did not onely this harme in <hi>Surrey,</hi> but also it afflicted <hi>Sussex,</hi> and diuers other places about the very same time. It was very strange when it fired <hi>Blea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chingley</hi> steeple, it entred also into the house of one <hi>Stephen L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What shall I write of mine owne tragicall <hi>euents</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the third of <hi>Ianuary</hi> 1608. which are nothing infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to any of the <hi>accidents</hi> here recited? But because I intend to set the same out more distinctly by it selfe, I will suspend the story only during the space of an houres reading from my Readers view. About the same time there happened in <hi>Dors<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

About foure a clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, as they were at Euensong, the steeple spire being strongly built of lime, stone, and sand, and beset with yron barres, was sodainly stricken downe with thunder and lightning, the leads were rent and torne, yea and which was most miraculous, the singing mens bookes were torne in their hands, and the seates before their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces likewise rent and broken. And this the glorious God hath done, because the mouthes of the wicked may be stopped, who iniuriously detract from his prouidence in imputing my misfortunes onely singled out aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; as though the same miraculous <hi>Mouer,</hi> which moued these heauenly creatures of his against me, did not also extend his power in the like degree vpon others in this Realme.

To confirme this imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mine, in the selfe same instant it thundered in such impetuous and extreame manner, that the earth moued (as sithence appeared in sundry other partes of this Realme) my house shooke, in so much that I am perswaded no canon no basilisco, nor any other artillery could make the like terrible report. With this fearefull volee together with the former light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>

                  <hi>seene in spirit the warning-peece shot off for this worlds dissolution, or finall alteration against the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall day of doome. Within halfe a quarter of an houre or thereabouts (as I coniecture) I returned to my selfe, and to my troubled senses at the loud cry, which two of my houshould, then being newly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked out of their senselesse traunce raysed, in seeing my wife falne on the ground and dead among them. At this noise which they made, changing my thoughts, I made full account, that my house had beene throwne downe with the thunder clap or earthquake, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore astonished as I was, to saue my life, (being as I imagined, in that great ieopardy,) I rose vp, and hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me downe into the lower roome or kitchin, where I had heard the cry. By the way, her daughter, being one of the two, whose cry I had heard in my chamber, met me, and told me that her mother was sodainely stricken dead. At my comming thither into the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, I found my wife quite depriued of life, in a blackish sweat, strongly sauouring of brimstone, which the Poets call,</hi> sacrum Sulphur, <hi>holy Sulphur, yet notwithstanding, least it might be a faint or swowne, I called for help to my seruants to haue her body bent forewards: but at the first, none directly vnderstood me, excepting the two aboue-named, vntil afterwards vpon our vehement lamentations and cries, the other</hi>
                  <pb n="280" facs="tcp:14310:154"/>
                  <hi>three (for there were in all, fiue, two men and three maides, besides my wife, in that roome,) beganne by little and little to come vnto themselues, hauing been all in one instant throwne downe to the ground as dead with the lightning and thunder. Two of these three last, at my first call and comming downe, reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: but the other, being a seruing-man of mine, lay longer in the trance. All of them stood as deafe and distracted, not able for their liues a long while to lift vp her dead body. Some of them could neyther heare nor vnderstand what I spake, nor what I would haue them doe: their braines were so confusedly shaken in their heads, that they could not for a long time an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere me in reason. When this fatall blow was giuen, my wife sate on a stoole, ouer-seeing her maydes mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of tallow. And for this purpose, the Seruing-man of whom I spake before, stood by her with a candle in his hand. The Kettle of tallow lay very neere vnto her. Aboue the place where shee sate, iust aboue her head, hung Bacon in the roofe of the house. All which being naturall nutriments of lightnings, by reason of their vnctuous substances, encreased the vertue thereof, and doubtlesse by the predestinate will of our heauenly Father, occasioned this foreible dampe, and perhaps augmented the earthquake. Her body was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and whole without diminution of any part, sauing a little of her hayre, which was rent or snatched off with the attyres of her head, &amp; her fillet, which were likewise somewhat burnt, and also sauoured of brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone. In like manner her stomacher, her whale-bone bodies, and her smocke neere about her heart, where</hi>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:14310:154"/>
                  <hi>there was a small marke somwhat black, were burnt, rent, and torne with the heauenly flame. Perhaps her corpulence (she being very grosse) caused her thus to be singled and selected out from among the rest of the company. But leauing that Philosophicall opinion alone to the vnsearchable knowledge of God, without whose prouidence one haire cannot fall from our heads, I will proceede further in declaring the tragicall euents which we found the next morning inflicted by the lightning, thunder and earthquake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The next morning (for all that night wee durst not bouge from the same roome, so greatly had feare</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>seazed on vs) wee saw all the tiles fallen for the most part from the house, and some dispersed in heapes vpon the house. Wee found the chimney top of the chamber where I lay, quite cast downe: part of the waightier stones tumbled through the chimney downe into my chamber, yea, and round about the bed where I lay at the time of this fatal blast, to the great astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of al that saw it: and surely it is miraculous how I escaped aliue, vnhurt, or vnscorcht in this terrible time of horror. Two glasse-windowes were also burnt with the lightning, whereof the one was a window by my beds feete: the other on the loft right aboue my chamber, and aboue my bed. Besides, three other glasse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windowes were battred and bruised with the thunder or earthquake. Aboue a dozen breaches or rents were found pierced through the wals of the house, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most foure foote thicke, and as strongly built, as could be of lime and stone. Also one of the beames was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what remoued from the place. And that which seemes</hi>

                  <hi>as strange, a fat Cow amidst many other Kine in the stable, was culled out and killed, or rather stifled with the Lightning: which induceth me (as I said before) to thinke, that this dampe tooke strength and power according to the nature therof, from such fat, liquide, and oylie substances or bodies. This opinion her selfe verified vnto me about a fortnight before shee dyed, when she caused all the candles in her house to be done out, for feare least the lightning, which at that time was somewhat fearefull, should encrease and receiue force from the candle light. Yet with this limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doe I attribute such matter of vnctuositie and vertue to lightnings from these inferiour bodies, that God who workes by measure, number, and waight, sends these or such like kinds of fate vpon vs to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish vs not to make reckoning of this world, as of a perpetuall Paradise, nor to sleepe ouer-long in the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous bosome of carelesse negligence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <hi>conceale another wonder, to wit, that she fore-tolde in her life time, as well to diuers others, as to my selfe the shortnesse of her life in this world: for this was an vsuall speach of hers sundry times within the same quarter of the yeare that she dyed:</hi> I know very well <hi>(quoth she)</hi> I cannot liue till the first of March. <hi>Another time, being (as I remember) not aboue three weekes before her death, descending downe from her chamber, where then she had beene at prayers, shee came smiling vnto me with these words:</hi> Husband, I bring you good tidings, you shall be rid of me, and you shall haue another wife: for I am fully
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:14310:155"/>
assured, that I shall dye very shortly, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first of March. And I thanke God, I am prepared; let him send when hee will. <hi>Which words of hers being by me accepted in iest; shee replyed, as if shee had seene a vision, or felt some extraordinary motion in her spirit:</hi> you thinke I speake in iest, but marke the end.</p>
               <p>Neyther did the Lord (I speake it to his glory) send this glorious alarme vnto mee without an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite or mysticall premonition, for about two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths before, or thereabouts (as farre as I remember) in a dreame I saw the very like accident. Mee thought I was at a Knight my brothers house, and there lying vpon my bed, I imagined to haue seene and heard vpon the sodaine in the night time a most terrible light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and thunder, in such wise, that I made full account the whole house had beene burnt or cast downe, and therefore to saue my life, with much adoe I hastned out of doores, where I supposed to haue beheld the inner part of the house terribly flaming with fire, and present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after I might see one conueying out of doores a Chest; whereupon I bewailed, that a blacke Truncke of mine, stored with money was left behind, consumed with the flame. This dreame I related to my said Brother, being at my house about three weekes before the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, &amp; wished him in my brotherly loue to looke som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more warily to his house, least night fires might endanger him, by reason of the height of his house (the same not inferiour for height to any house which I haue seene) and likewise by reason of the partitions being timber-worke Neuerthelesse for all this, I aduise not the Reader to embrace this dreame of mine for an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble president, because that dreames sort our commonly according to the diet, temperate, or intemperate, sparing,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:14310:156"/>
or gluttonous, which men vse. And yet I beleeue, <hi>God</hi> seldome vseth to inflict any notable accident vpon a charitable <hi>Christian,</hi> that mortifies his body with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent fasting, and moderates his soule with contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heauenly mysteries, vvithout some secret pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drome, or fore-running glimpse of his powerfull pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Nor doe I aduise my Reader to surmise, that I conceiue ouer credulously or superstitiously of <hi>Morph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus it pleased the glorious <hi>Lord</hi> of lightnings, to extend his miraculous mercy towards me, and perhaps <note place="margin">5.</note> to leaue me <hi>(as a firebrand taken out of the burning, or as Ezechiels signe)</hi> for a testimonie of his lightning glory <note place="margin">

Gods miracles, as a memoriall of her liuing vertues, and as a monument towards her of my kinde affection. It is the last solemnitie, the last precious oyntment which I can poure vpon her head, the last <hi>Adieu,</hi> the last office of good will, which I can accomplish for her sake. This kind of Epitaphes in honour of the dead, an holy Father highly commendeth: <hi>It is pietie</hi> (saith he) <hi>to publish the deceaseds vertues, yea, it is a meanes to encrease grace in our</hi>
