         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A LETTER To the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>P.</hi> In Answer to the Arguing Part of his First Letter.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. THAT you may not take it unkindly the Arguing Part of your Letter to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> should pass unregarded, I have been prevail'd upon to accept of his Commission to hold his Cards, while he is not in Circumstances to play out his Game him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. But can assure you beforehand, since Matter of <hi>Fact</hi> is clearing by other Hands more proper, I mean to confine my self to Matter of <hi>Right</hi>; and so shall give you the least and most excusable trouble that can be, a short one.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your Letter tells us, that the Conference was for the sake of a Gentleman, who I heard desir'd to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd that <hi>Protestants</hi> are absolutely certain of what they believe, and made account you could satisfie him, and profess'd, if you could not, he would quit your Communion. And you take care to inform us (<hi>p.</hi> 2.) that he was satisfi'd, and <hi>declar'd immediately</hi> after the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44996:4"/>
Conference, that <hi>he was much more confirm'd in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of your Church by it, and resolv'd to continue in it.</hi> But could you not have afforded to inform us likewise <hi>by what</hi> he was satisfi'd? For there is many a Man who would be as glad, and is as much concern'd to be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd in that Point as that Gentleman; and he would not have been a jot the less <hi>confirm'd</hi> or the less <hi>resolv'd,</hi> if his Neighbor had been confirm'd and resolv'd with him. I cannot for my life imagin why you should make a Secret of a thing, which, besides your own and your Churches Honor, concerns the Salvation of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands and thousands to know.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Your Letter I perceive would shift it off to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> whom you <hi>desire (p.</hi> 7.) to prove that Protestants have <hi>no Absolute Certainty,</hi> &amp;c. Of this Proposal there will be occasion to say more by and by. At the present I pray you consider how you deal with those Souls who rely on you. If you should move them to trust their Estates with a Man of your naming, of whom you would give no other satisfaction that he were able to manage them, and faithful, and responsible, but only to bid those who doubted, prove the contrary; I fancy there would need all the Credit you have to hinder the Motion from appearing very strange: And yet you have the confidence to make them one as much stranger as their Souls are more worth than their Mony: For you would have them hazard their Souls where they are not safe, for any care you take to satisfie them that they are. Why, suppose Mr. <hi>G.</hi> could not prove that Protestants are not Certain, are they therefore Certain? Has <hi>Peter</hi> Twenty pounds in his Purse, because <hi>Paul</hi> cannot prove he has not? Or, ever the more Title to an Estate, because an Adversary may have the ill luck to be Non-suited? Must not every body speak for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44996:4"/>
one day, and bring in his own Account, which will pass or not pass as it is or is not faulty in it self, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any fault have been found in it before or no? And will not the Happiness or Misery of their Souls for ever depend on that Account? Can you suffer them to run that terrible hazard, without making them able to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie their Accounts themselves, and furnishing them with assurance that they can, and with no more to say but that they hop'd Dr. <hi>St.</hi> would make his Party good with Mr. <hi>G.?</hi> That things so precious to God as Souls should be of no more value with those who set up for Ministers of the Gospel! That their great and only care, as far as I see, should be to make a shew, and pass for some body here, let every one take his chance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after! Besides, Truth is therefore <hi>Truth,</hi> because 'tis built on Intrinsecal Grounds which prove it to be such; and not on private Mens Abilities, or their saying this or that; wherefore till those Grounds be produc'd, it cannot be with reason held <hi>Truth:</hi> And Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is more particularly oblig'd to make good he has such Grounds, having had such ill fortune formerly with the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> to which he undertook to reduce <hi>Protestant Faith,</hi> as appears by the Account given of them in <hi>Error Non-plust.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But, leaving these Matters to be Answer'd where we must all answer why we have believ'd so and so; pray let us have fair play in the mean time. Let every one bear his own Burthen, and you not think to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge your self by throwing your Load on another Man's Shoulders. You affirm there is Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty on the Protestants side and 'tis for him to <hi>prove</hi> it who <hi>affirms</hi> it. If you do it but half so well as Mr. <hi>G.</hi> can, and has, the Infallibility which he asserts, you will earn Thanks from one side, and Admiration from the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44996:5"/>
other. But it is for <hi>you</hi> to do it: To trick off proving the contrary upon your Adversary, is to own that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> is a thing which agrees not with your Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in which your Heart misgives you.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Yet even so you were uneasie still, and would not venture what Mr. <hi>G.</hi> could do, as slightly as you think, or would have others think of him. You know well enough, that to prove Protestants have no Absolute Certainty of their Faith, is no hard Task even for a weak Man:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> Tillotson<hi>'s Rule of Faith,</hi> p. 117, 118.</note> You know any Man may find it confess'd to his hand by Protestants. And therefore you had reason to bethink your self of an Expedient to trick it off again from that Point,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pag.</hi> 7.</note> and put Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to prove, That <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants have no Absolute Certainty as to the Rule of their Faith,</hi> viz. <hi>the Scripture.</hi> The Merits of this Cause too I think will return hereafter more fitly; in this place I mind only the <hi>Art.</hi> Pray, was not the very First Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion at the Conference,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> St's <hi>Second Letter,</hi> p. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Whether Protestants are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Certain that</hi> they <hi>hold now the same Tenets in Faith, and All that our Saviour taught to his Apostles?</hi> And your Answer that <hi>They are</hi>? Did our Saviour teach, and do Protestants believe no more, than that the Book so call'd is <hi>Scripture?</hi> Is Certainty of this <hi>more,</hi> and Certainty of this <hi>Book</hi> all one? And was not the Question plainly of the Certainty of this, and of <hi>All</hi> this <hi>more?</hi> Here is then an Enquiry after one thing plainly turn'd off to another. Yes; but this was one of the <hi>two things which the whole Conference depended upon.</hi> As if the whole Conference did not depend on that thing which was to be made manifest by the Conference, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Absolute Certainty of Protestant Faith.</hi> Mr. <hi>G.</hi> indeed did himself ask some Questions about your Certainty of your Rule; Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whose course it was wisely done to cut off, before they had question'd away your Certainty of Faith. For,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44996:5"/>
after they had caus'd it to be admitted, that the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Scripture is from Tradition, there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to admit that Tradition causes Certainty, and makes Faith as Certain as Scripture. And then it would have prov'd something difficult to satisfie even a willing Man, that the Faith is Certain which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit to a Faith come down by Tradition. But it was seen whereto it would come, and thought fit to break off in time, and not let the Conference proceed too far. In the mean time Absolute Certainty of Scripture was not the Point of the Conference, nor is it the Point of Concern. Besides that 'tis agreed on all hands, Men are Sav'd by <hi>Believing</hi> and <hi>Practising</hi> what <hi>Christ</hi> taught, not barely by believing <hi>Scripture is Scripture</hi>: And Salvation is the thing that imports us in these Disputes, and 'twere well that nothing else were minded by Disputers. But it imported you it seems both to shift off <hi>Proving</hi> from your self, and to stifle any further Talk of the Certainty of Protestant Faith, and keep us from looking that way by fixing our Eyes on another Object. And this is all you do; but with so much Art, that I verily think many a Reader is persuaded you are talking all the while to the purpose. The truth is, you have reason to carry it as you do; for it is good to avoid underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king what cannot be perform'd: And you <hi>cannot,</hi> and I believe <hi>know you cannot</hi> make out, That Protestants are Absolutely Certain, that they now hold all the same Doctrin that was taught by <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles, as you affirm'd in your Answer to Mr. <hi>G's</hi> first Question. And this I thought it imported to tell you plainly and publickly, that it might be in your hands to pin the Controversie-basket, and bring all Catholics to your Church; where I will answer you will be sure to find us, if you make us sure we shall find this Certainty there when we come.</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:44996:6"/>6. In the mean time why has not Mr. <hi>G.</hi> done alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy as much as should be done? It is plain, that where Churches differ in Faith, <hi>Infallible Faith</hi> in one, cannot stand with <hi>Certain Faith</hi> in the other. Wherefore if Mr. <hi>G.</hi> have fix'd Infallibility in his own Church, he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd Certainty from all that differ from her. Let us then take and sift Mr. <hi>G's</hi> Argument, even as you put it, who had not, I suppose, partiality enough for him, to make it better than it was. You put it thus, <hi>p.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>All Traditionary Christians believe the same to day which they did yesterday, and so up to the time of our Blessed Saviour; and if they follow this Rule, they can never err in Faith, therefore are Infallible. And you</hi> (Mr. G.) <hi>prov'd they could not innovate in Faith, unless they did forget what they held the day before, or out of malice alter it.</hi> And now,</p>
                  <p>That there may be no mistake, let us take each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position by it self.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The First is, [<hi>All Traditionary Christians believe the same to day which they did yesterday, and so up to the time of our Blessed Saviour.</hi>] You have nothing to say to this, I hope: For since <hi>Traditionary Christians</hi> are those who proceed upon <hi>Tradition,</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Immediate Delivery,</hi> it follows, that unless they believe the same to day which they did yesterday, and so upwards, they cease to be <hi>Traditionary Christians,</hi> by proceeding not upon an <hi>Immediate,</hi> but an <hi>Interrupted</hi> Delivery, or some other Principle. And so there is no denying this Proposition, but by affirming that Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary Christians are not Traditionary Christians.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The second Proposition is this. [<hi>And if they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Rule, they can never err in Faith.</hi>] This is pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably self-evident: For, to follow this Rule is <hi>to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve still the same to day which they did yesterday:</hi> And so,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44996:6"/>
if they did this from Christ's time, and so forwards, they must still continue to believe, to the end of the World, the self-same that Christ and his Apostles taught; and, therefore, cannot err in Faith, unless those Authors of our Faith did: Which that they did not, is not to be prov'd to Christians.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. There follows this Inference: [<hi>Therefore they are Infallible.</hi>] This is no less plainly self-evident. For these words [<hi>They can never err in Faith</hi>] in the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, and [<hi>They are Infallible</hi>] in the Consequent, are most manifestly the self-same in sense, and perfectly equivalent.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The fourth and last (which according to you, aim'd to prove, that they could not innovate) is this. [<hi>They could not innovate in Faith, unless they did forget what they held the day before, or out of malice alter it.</hi>] And this is no less unexceptionable than its Fellows. For, if they <hi>knew not</hi> they alter'd Faith, when they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd it, they had <hi>forgot</hi> what they believ'd the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. If they alter'd it <hi>wittingly,</hi> excuse them from <hi>Malice</hi> who can; who, believing, as all who proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Tradition do, that Tradition is the certain Means to convey the Doctrin of Christ, would notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alter the Doctrin convey'd to them by Tradition. Pray what ails this Argument? and what wants it, save bare Application, to conclude what was intended as fully and as rigorously as you can desire? And, pray, what need was there to apply it to the Roman Church, and say she follow'd Tradition, to you who deny it not either of the Roman or Greek Church? As every thing is true, and every thing clear; who now besides your self would have thought of an evasion from it? And yet you venture at one, such as it is.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. You tell us then, (<hi>p.</hi> 5.) That <hi>you thought the best way
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44996:7"/>
to shew the vanity of this rare Demonstration, was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an Instance of such as follow'd Tradition, and yet Mr. G. could not deny to have err'd, and that was of the Greek Church,</hi> &amp;c. You had e'en as good have said, what Mr. <hi>G.</hi> says is true, but yet he does not say true for all that. For to pitch upon nothing for false, is, in Disputes, to own that every thing is true. The <hi>best way,</hi> say you? I should have thought it every jot as good a way to have said nothing when one has nothing to say. But yet the World is oblig'd to you for letting them know what Scholars knew before, that Protestants <hi>think it the best way</hi> to answer Catholic Arguments, to give them no Answer at all: For you are not to be told that this Instance of yours is not an Answer to Mr. <hi>G</hi>-'s Argument, but a new Argument against him of your own, which undoubtedly you might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd as well as my Lord <hi>Falkland,</hi> if you had been, as my Lord <hi>Falkland</hi> was, <hi>arguing.</hi> But it is your turn now to <hi>answer.</hi> And must you be minded of what every Smatterer in Logic knows, that an Answerer is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to his <hi>Concedo,</hi> his <hi>Nego,</hi> and <hi>Distinguo,</hi> as the Propositions which he is to speak to, are True, False or Ambiguous? He may deny the Inference too, if he find more or other Terms in the Conclusion than in the Premises. But <hi>these</hi> are his Bounds; and Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turns Babbling, when they are exceeded. Must you be minded that the Business must be stopt before it come to the Conclusion, and that otherwise there is no speaking against it? For you know that if the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses be right, and the Inference good, the Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be as necessarily True, as it is that the same thing cannot be, and not be at once; that is, must be more certain than that <hi>England,</hi> for Example, shall not crumble into Atoms, or be swallow'd up in the Sea to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44996:7"/>
morrow: For this, and a thousand such things <hi>may</hi> happen to all material Nature; that a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should prove True, <hi>cannot.</hi> And 'tis perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction that Terms which cohere in the Premises, by being the same with a Third, should not cohere with one another in the Conclusion. Must you be minded that an <hi>Arguer</hi> is to <hi>prove</hi> his Conclusion, and an Answerer to shew he does not, by assigning where and how he fails? Do you do any such matter? Do you so much as go about it? And would you have what you say pass for an Answer? Pray consider the Case: The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is Infallible, says Mr. <hi>G.</hi>: She is not, say you. He brings his Argument, and you your Instance against it. What are People the wiser now? and which shall they be for; the Argument or the Instance? They have reason to think well of the <hi>Argument,</hi> because you have no fault to find with it; and they may think as they please of the <hi>Instance.</hi> You would not, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, have them believe you both, and think the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for your sake <hi>Fallible,</hi> and, for his, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> at once. Pray what assistance do you afford them to determin either way? And what do you more than e'en leave them to draw Cuts, and venture their Souls as handy-dandy shall decide, for you or Mr. <hi>G.</hi>? 'Tis true, when <hi>Zeno</hi> would needs be paradoxing against the possibility of Motion, his Vanity was not ill ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul'd by the walking of <hi>Diogenes</hi> before him. For 'twas palpably and ridiculously <hi>vain</hi> to talk against Motion with a Tongue, that must needs move to talk against it. And there may be <hi>vanity</hi> too in our Case, for ought I know: But where shall it be lodg'd? Why more with Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s. Argument than your Instance? Why is it more <hi>vain</hi> to pretend to prove Infallibility, upon which depend the Hopes which Millions and Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44996:8"/>
have of a blessed Eternity, and which is prov'd by Arguments, to which you think it <hi>your best way</hi> not to attempt to Answer, than it is to except against a Conclusion, against the Premises whereof there lies no Exception? That is, to find fault with a Sum Total, and find none in the particulars, or the casting up: For a Conclusion is a kind of Sum Total of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. But it is infinitely more <hi>vain</hi> to talk against one Infallibility, unless you will set up another. For, if there be no Means, by which Men may be secur'd, that the ways they take to arrive at their greatest and only Good will not <hi>deceive</hi> them, it cannot be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they will take all the pains that are necessary to compass that Good, which for ought they can tell, they may not compass with all their pains. 'Tis a pleasant thing in you to talk of the <hi>vanity</hi> of Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s. Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, when, by seeking to take Infallibility out of the World, you are making the whole Creation <hi>vain.</hi> For all Material Nature was made for Rational Nature, and Rational Nature requires Rational Satisfaction in all its proceedings, and most of all in the pursuit of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness: And what Rational Satisfaction can there be, if there may be <hi>Deceit</hi> in whatever can be propos'd for Satisfaction? In short, the Result of your Instance, whatever was the Aim, it is to amuse and confound People, and hinder them perhaps from seeing what otherwise would be clear; but it shews them nothing, nor <hi>can</hi>; for that Argument of yours is not at all of a shewing Nature.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. 'Tis, at best, but an Argument (as they call it) <hi>ad hominem</hi>; which you know are of the worst sort of Arguments. They serve for nothing but to stop an Adversaries mouth, or shame him, if he cannot answer without contradicting himself; but are of no use to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44996:8"/>
the Discovery of <hi>Truth.</hi> For a thing is not the more or less True, because such a Man's Tongue is ty'd up for speaking against it. But is it so much as an Argument <hi>ad hominem?</hi> As all the little force of the Topic consists in the Obligation which a Man may have to grant or deny what it <hi>supposes</hi> he does, it affords no Argument at all against the Man who has no such Obligation. And pray where does it appear that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> is oblig'd not to deny that the Greek Church has err'd in matters of Faith? And how can <hi>you,</hi> of all Men, suppose he is? You, who in your Rational Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count (<hi>p.</hi> 32.) quote these words from <hi>Peter Lombard; The Difference between the Greeks and Latins, is in Words and not in Sense:</hi> Name <hi>Thomas à Iesu,</hi> and <hi>Azorius,</hi> and tell us of other Roman Catholic Authors, of the same judgment, whom I suppose you could name. Pray, how comes Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to lye under an Obligation, from which Men of Reputation in his own Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are exempt? And what a wise Argument <hi>ad ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem</hi> have you made against him, whom your self have furnish'd with an Argument <hi>ad hominem</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it when he pleases? In fine, he goes to work like a Scholar, puts his Premises, and infers his Conclusion, which you know cannot but be True, if there be no Fault in his Premises: And 'tis for you to find one when you can. You put nothing to shew how the Inference you make should be True, but barely assume, without proof, that he <hi>cannot deny it</hi> (p. 5.): As if Truth depended on his Denying or Affirming, and that what People say or think, made things True or False. And even, for so much, you are at his Courtesie: If he be not the better Natur'd, and will crossly affirm or deny in the wrong place, you and your Argument are left in the lurch. In a word, one may see he aim'd at Truth, who takes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44996:9"/>
at least the way to it: what you aim'd at, you best know; but no body shall ever discover what is, or is not True, by your Method.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But that you may not complain, your Cock is not suffer'd to fight, let us see what your Instance will do. You put it thus, (<hi>p.</hi> 5.) <hi>The Greek Church went upon Tradition from Father to Son, as much as ever the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man did. And I desir'd to know of Mr.</hi> G. <hi>whether the Greek Church notwithstanding did not err in matters of Faith; And, if it did, then a Church holding to Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not Infallible.</hi> How! <hi>If it did?</hi> Why then it is apparent if it did not, your Argument holds not. And will you assume that the Greek Church errs, who believe she does not? Will you take a Premise to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a Conclusion, upon which the Salvation of People depends, which Premise your self in your own heart think is not true? Can you deal thus with their Souls, who pin them upon you, perswade them of what you are not perswaded your self, and offer them a Securiy for their Eternity, in which your own judgment tells you there is a flaw? For you have declar'd your self upon this Matter in your <hi>Rational Account,</hi> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken great pains to clear the Greek Church, at least upon the Article of the Holy Ghost, in which consists their main difference with the Latins, and to which the other two you mention were added, I suppose, for fashion sake. I know you there propose to free that Church from the charge of Heresie. But pray what difference betwixt <hi>Heresie</hi> and <hi>Error in matter of Faith?</hi> unless you will trifle about Obstinacy, and such collateral considerations; which neither concern us here, nor were any part of your Defence there. I see too that you word it here conditionally, and with reference to Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s. Answer: As if his Answer made
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44996:9"/>
or marr'd, and the Greek Church did or did not err, as he says, <hi>I,</hi> or <hi>No.</hi> Whatever Mr. <hi>G.</hi> may say, or you have said, unless the Greek Church actually does Err, your Instance is no Instance of a Church that goes upon Tradition and Errs; and your Inference that <hi>then a Church holding to Tradition was not Infallible,</hi> is wondrous pertinently inferr'd from the Example of a Church that <hi>errs not.</hi> Pray take it well that I intreat you by all the care you have of your own Soul, and should have of others, to manage Disputes about Faith a little otherwise, and not propose Arguments, in which you must needs think your self there is no force. For there is plainly none in this, if the Greek Church <hi>does not</hi> err; and you at least think she does not. I am sure 'tis what I would not do my self for all the World.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But to proceed to Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s. Answer, (<hi>p.</hi> 5.) <hi>It was</hi> say you, <hi>that the Greek Church follow'd Tradition, till the</hi> Arians <hi>left that Rule and took up a new one,</hi> &amp;c. And why has he not answer'd well? You assum'd that the Greek Church err'd while it went upon Tradition; If you did not, you said nothing; for, that a Church may follow Tradition at one time, and leave it at another, is no news. 'Tis the case of all erring Churches which ever follow'd Tradition at all. Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Reply then that Tradition was follow'd till another Rule was taken up, denies that Tradition and Error were found together, as you contended, in the Greek Church. And pray what more direct or more full Answer can there be to an Argument, than to deny the Premises? As slightly as you would seem to think of him, he understood dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting better than to start aside into an Exception against your Conclusion, but answers fair and home by denying the Assumption from which you infer it;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44996:10"/>
which now he has done, you know it rests with you to prove it; and yet you never think on't, as far as I see; but, as if you had no more to do, fall a complaining against Mr. <hi>G.</hi> for speaking of the <hi>Arians,</hi> and not of the present Greek Church; and against his Copy, for leaving out the Inference which you drew. In doing which, if he did so, he did you no small kindness; there being no Premises to draw the Inference from, as has been shewn above; or if any, such as put you to contradict your own Doctrin ere any thing could fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from them.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. As for the omission of the Inference, I know not how it happen'd, nor mean to meddle with matter of Fact. But I see they had reason, who observ'd before me, that 'tis a thing of no manner of Consequence, I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily think, in your own Judgment. Unless you think the Age we live in so dull, that, without much ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering it into their Heads, it cannot be perceiv'd, that if a Church <hi>has</hi> err'd which held to Tradition, a Church <hi>may</hi> err which holds to Tradition. Or, unless you think it of mighty Consequence to have an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence stand in the Relation which fell with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises at the Conference. Mr. <hi>G.</hi> took them away by his denial, and you must begin again, and bring some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from whence you may draw an Inference, if you will needs have an Inference; for an Inference cannot be drawn from nothing. Pray divert us not perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally from minding what we are about; but remember the Question now is, Whether the Greek Church held to Tradition and err'd at once? and bethink your self, if you please of a <hi>Medium,</hi> which will infer that Point for you; for Mr. <hi>G.</hi> you see denies it.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. From his mentioning the <hi>Arians</hi> you take occasi-to speak big, and bear us in hand he was hard put to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44996:10"/>
it, and sought an occasion, and affirm (<hi>p.</hi> 6.) you could get <hi>no Answer at all</hi> to the Case of the present Greek Church. As if his Answer pincht on the <hi>Arians,</hi> and were not as full to the present as past Greek Church. It goes on this, That those who err in Faith, let them be who they will, and the Error what it will, and in what Time and Place you will, all leave Tradition. Whether the Case of the present Greek Church be the same with the <hi>Arians,</hi> is matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> with which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> did well not to meddle; it is for you to make it out, if you will make good your Argument. Modern or Ancient Heresie is all one to his Answer, which is applicable to <hi>all</hi> Heresie: And you complain of the want of an Answer when you <hi>have</hi> one. Pray, if a Man should put an Objection to you about an Animal, for Example, and you answer it of <hi>all</hi> Animals, would you think it just in him to quarrel with you for not mentioning the Rational or Irrational in particular? And yet this is your Quarrel to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> All your mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Talk (<hi>p.</hi> 6.) of <hi>undeniably true, granted by</hi> Mr. G. <hi>known to every one, &amp;c.</hi> as apt as I see it is to make a Reader believe your Instance is notoriously true, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which Mr. <hi>G.</hi> has nothing to say, cannot make me, or any Man of Reason, who examins the Point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he has any Reason to say more, till you do. He has answer'd directly, and positively deny'd, that Error and Tradition can be found together in the Greek Church, or any other, modern or ancient. There it sticks, and you may drive it on farther (it being your own Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) if you please. Only when you tell us (<hi>p.</hi> 6.) that the present Greek Church <hi>in all its Differences with the Roman, still pleaded Tradition, and adher'd to it,</hi> I wish you had told us whether you speak of Differences in <hi>matter of Faith,</hi> or no. For Differences may be occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44996:11"/>
by matters of Faith, which are not Differences in Faith. If you do not, you support your Instance very strongly, and prove the consistence of Tradition with Error in Faith very Learnedly, from Differences which belong not to Faith. If you do, as Nature itches after strange Sights, I long to see by what Differences, or any thing else, it can be made out, That an erring Church <hi>can still plead Tradition, and adhere to it.</hi> Not but that for <hi>Pleading</hi> much may be, there are such confident doings in the World. As certain as it is, that the Religion in <hi>England</hi> now, is not the same which it was before <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, I think there is confidence enough in <hi>England</hi> to plead Tradition for it. 'Tis but finding some Expression in an ancient Writer, not couch'd with Prophetical foresight enough to avoid being understood, as some will desire it should, and it will serve turn to pretend to Antiquity, and bear the Name of Tradition. So I suspect you take it your self, when you say the <hi>Arians</hi> insisted on Tradition: For sure you do not think in earnest, that Doctrin contrary to Consubstantiality, was taught by <hi>Christ,</hi> and believ'd from Father to Son till the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> This, or some such thing may perhaps have been <hi>pleaded</hi>; but for <hi>adhering to Tradition,</hi> Your Servant. For, pray, did <hi>Christ</hi> teach any Error? When a Father believ'd what <hi>Christ</hi> taught him, and the Son what the Father believ'd, did not the Son too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what <hi>Christ</hi> taught? Run it on to the last Son that shall be born in the World, must not every one believe what <hi>Christ</hi> taught, if every one believ'd what his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believ'd? And will you go about to persuade us, that there actually is a company of Men in the World who <hi>adher'd</hi> to this Method, all Sons believing always as their Fathers did, whereof the First believ'd as <hi>Christ</hi> taught, and who notwithstanding err'd in matters of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44996:11"/>
Faith? They would thank you for making this out, who would be glad that <hi>Christ</hi> taught Error and were not God. But it is not plainer that Two and Three make Five, than it is that this cannot be. And yet you would top it upon us, and bear us in hand it is not only true, but apparent in the Greek Church, and known to every body who knows any thing of it. The comfort is, there is nothing for all these Assertions but your Word; in which, where you stick not to pass it for an arrant Impossibility, I for my part do not think there is Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Certainty.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. I see not what there remains more, but to bear in mind where we are. At the Conference, instead of answering Mr. <hi>G's</hi> Argument, you would needs make one of your own, which was in short; <hi>The Greek Church goes upon Tradition and errs, therefore another Church may err which goes upon Tradition.</hi> There was no need to trouble the Greek Church for the matter: It had been altogether as methodical, and as much to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to have instanc'd in the Latin Church it self, and never gon further; and shorter, to have spar'd Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing too, and have said without more ado, <hi>Mr.</hi> G<hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is not true</hi>: For you do no more, till you make it appear, that the Church you pitch upon for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, do's indeed <hi>adhere</hi> to Tradition and <hi>err.</hi> But, because this had been too open, and People would have sooner perceiv'd that it had been to say, <hi>I know not how to answer Mr.</hi> G<hi>'s Argument, but will notwithstanding stand to it, that his Conclusion is false,</hi> you thought the best way to divert the Reader's attention from what's before him, was to travel into <hi>Greece</hi>; and yet when you come there, do no more than if you had stay'd at home: For you barely <hi>say</hi> there is both Tradition and Error in the Greek Church, and you might have said
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44996:12"/>
as much of the Latin; or, without mentioning either, have said, <hi>Tho' Mr. G. has prov'd a Traditionary Church cannot err, I say it can and has.</hi> All is but <hi>Saying</hi> till you come to <hi>Proving</hi>: Only to make a formal shew with an Antecedent and a Conclusion, you say it with the Ceremony of an Argument; of which since Mr. <hi>G.</hi> deny'd the Antecedent, he had no more to do till you prov'd it.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. So it stood at the Conference, and so it stands still, and for ought I see, is like to stand: For tho' you have writ two Letters since, there appears no word of Proof in either, or sign that you do so much as think on it: You only say your Instance over again, and would have the Face you set upon it, and great Words you give it, make it pass for plain and undeniable, when all the while it is plainly impossible, and actually deny'd. Mr. <hi>G.</hi> I hope, will bide by his Answer, because it is a good one, true in it self, and direct to the Point: For it denies just what you assum'd, That the Greek Church stood upon Tradition, and fell at the same time into Error. And speaking as you do, or should do, of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in matter of Faith, <hi>Euclid</hi> never made any thing plainer than it is, That where ever Error comes in, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition goes out. Of necessity therefore, if the present Greek Church have adher'd to Tradition, it has not err'd: If it have err'd, it has not adher'd to Tradition. Which of the two is the Case, neither concerns Mr. <hi>G.</hi> nor can he dispute it without following bad Example, that is, falling to Argue now it is his Part to Answer. You would pass it upon us, that the Greek Church has err'd without swerving from Tradition; and you must either make it out, or acknowledge you have made much ado about nothing: For your Instance is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, till it appears to be true; Till you do it, there is no Work for Mr. <hi>G.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:44996:12"/>20 At the close (<hi>p.</hi> 7.) you <hi>desire</hi> Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to <hi>make good two things,</hi> and tell us why you desire it, and what will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low if he accept or decline your Motion. I neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how your Proposals follow from your Reasons, nor your Consequences from your Proposals: But think it no more worth losing time upon: them, than you <hi>thought it worth boasting of the Victory.</hi> The First is, <hi>That we</hi> [Protestants] <hi>have no Absolute Certainty as to the Rule of our Faith,</hi> viz. <hi>the Scripture; altho' we have a larger and firmer Tradition for it,</hi> viz. the Consent of all Christian Churches, <hi>than you</hi> [Catholics] <hi>can have for the Points of Faith in difference between us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. I can tell you a better Reason for this Proposal than any you give. There was no avoiding to own Absolute Certainty to a Man who talk'd of quitting your Communion without it. But you knew well enough that your <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> would be thwittled into <hi>Sufficient Certainty,</hi> and <hi>Sufficient Certainty</hi> into <hi>no Certainty</hi> at last; and had your Wits about you when you thought of this Proposal: For it is in effect to say, <hi>This Certainty of Faith is a troublesom matter, and not for my turn; Let us go to something else, leave Faith and pass to Scripture; of which you, Mr. G. shall prove we have no Absolute Certainty: For, if I should go about to prove we have, I foresee, that while I am seeking harbor in my larger and firmer Tradition, I shall venture to split upon your Infallibility,</hi>

And yet they have all as much Certainty of <hi>Scripture</hi> as you. The truth is, if you were prest to make out your Absolute Certainty even of Scripture in your way, you would perhaps find a hard Task of it, for all your Appeal to Tradition. But it was not the Point for which the Conference was, nor ought it be the Point here, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to meddle with it, and you trust much to his good Nature to propose it: For, besides that all the thanks he would have for his pains, would be to have the Arguments against your Certainty, turn'd against the Certainty of Scripture one day, as if he did not believe Scripture Certain: You would have him undertake a matter in which he has no concern, to save you from an Undertaking in which you are deeply concern'd, but with which you know not how to go thorow; which is a very reasonable Request. In a word, it is for you either to make manifest now, what you should have made manifest at the Conference, <hi>viz.</hi> That Protestants have Absolute Certainty, not only of the Scripture, which they call their <hi>Rule,</hi> but of the <hi>Faith</hi> which they pretend to have from that Rule; or else to suffer another thing to be manifest, <hi>viz.</hi> That I said true when I said you <hi>cannot</hi> do it; and thither I am sure it will come.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. However, I am glad to hear any Talk from you of <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> even tho' it be but Talk: 'Tis a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44996:13"/>
great Stranger, as coming from your Quarters, and has a friendly and an accommodating look, and therefore for both regards deserves a hearty welcome. For this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Profession makes a fair approach towards the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of <hi>Infallibility,</hi> or rather 'tis the self-same with it; it being against Common Sense to say you judge your self <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> of any thing, if at the same time you judge you may be <hi>deceiv'd</hi> in thus judging. But I accept the <hi>Omen</hi> that you seem to grant you are thus <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> or Infallible, by virtue of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for this makes Tradition to be an Infallible Ascertainer in <hi>some</hi> things at least; and, so, unless some special difficulty be found in <hi>other</hi> things that light into the same Channel, it must needs bring <hi>them</hi> down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly too. Now I cannot for my heart discern what great difficulty there can be 'to remember all along the yesterdays Faith, or to be willing to be guided and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by their yesterdays Fathers, Teachers and Pastors; especially the sense of the Points (to omit many other means) being determin'd by open and daily Practice. Yet I a little fear all this your seeming kindness for Tradition, is only for your own Interest; and that, because you were necessitated to make use of it to abet Scripture's Letter, you allow it in that regard, these high Complements; but in other things, particularly in conveying down a Body of Christian Faith (which is incomparably more easie) it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently become useless and good for nothing. In the former exigency you esteem it <hi>A worthy Rule,</hi> but in the later duty, <hi>A Rule worthy</hi>—</p>
                  <p n="23">23. Now to let the Reader plainly see that it was meer Force, and not Inclination, which oblig'd you to grant an Absolute Certainty in Tradition conveying down Scriptures Letter, we will examin what you
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44996:14"/>
allow'd it when you laid your <hi>Principles,</hi> and so spoke your own free thoughts unconstrain'd by any Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Your fifteenth Principle is put down (<hi>p.</hi> 90.) in <hi>Error Nonplust,</hi> and that part of it that concerns this present Point, is thus reflected upon by your Adversary (<hi>p.</hi> 92, 93.) [<hi>Again, tho all this were true, and that</hi> the Scriptures were own'd as containing in them the whole Will of God so plainly reveal'd, that no sober Enquirer can miss of what's necessary to Salvation, <hi>and that therefore there needed no Church to</hi> explain <hi>them: Yet 'tis a strange Consequence, that</hi> therefore there can be no necessity of any Infallible Society of Men to <hi>Attest them, or to witness</hi> that <hi>the</hi> Letter <hi>of Scripture is right. This is so far from</hi> following <hi>out of the former part of Dr.</hi> St's. <hi>Discourse, that the</hi> contrary <hi>ought to follow; or, from prejudicing his own pretence, that it conduces exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to it. For certainly his</hi> Sober Enquirer <hi>would less be in doubt to</hi> miss of what's necessary to Salvation <hi>in case</hi> the <hi>Letter, on which all depends, be</hi> well <hi>attested, than if it be not; and most certainly an Infallible Society of Men can</hi> better <hi>attest that Letter than a</hi> Fallible <hi>one: and those Writings can with better shew of Reason be</hi> own'd <hi>to</hi> contain <hi>in them the</hi> Will of God, <hi>if their Letter be attested beyond possibility of being wrong, than if</hi> left <hi>in a possibility of being</hi> such; <hi>for if the</hi> Letter <hi>be wrong,</hi> All <hi>is wrong in this case.</hi>—] As manifest then as 'tis, that to be <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> of any thing, is not to be <hi>Fallibly Certain</hi> of it; that is, as manifest as 'tis, that to be <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely Certain</hi> of a thing, is to be <hi>Infallibly Certain</hi> of it; so manifest it is, that you <hi>there</hi> contradict your self <hi>here,</hi> and, that, however you may endeavour to come off, you allow not heartily, nor without some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and reluctancy, an Absolute Certainty to Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even in <hi>Attesting</hi> Scripture's <hi>Letter.</hi>

                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:44996:14"/>24. In these words of yours (<hi>p.</hi> 7) [<hi>As to the Rule of our Faith</hi>] give me leave to reflect on the word [<hi>OVR,</hi>] and thence to ask you, <hi>who are YOV?</hi> A Question which I ask not of your Name or Sirname, but of your Judgment (as you call it) of Discretion. Are you a Socinian, an Arian, a Sabellian, an Euty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or what are you? Are you a whole, or a half, or a Quarter-nine-and-thirty-Article Man? Do you take them for Snares, or Fences, and when for the one, and when for the other, and wherefore? These words [<hi>The Rule of OVR Faith</hi>] make you all these at once; for all these profess unanimously Scripture's Letter is <hi>their</hi> Rule of Faith. Mr. <hi>G.</hi> when he came to your House, imagin'd he was to treat with a <hi>Protestant,</hi> or something like it, and to have learn'd from you what Absolute Certainty you would assign for <hi>your,</hi> (that is, <hi>Protestant</hi>) Faith; and you give him only a Generical Latitudinarian Rule, common to all the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies in the World. The Project of the Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion-Bill was a trifle to this: It brings into one Fold all the most enormous Straglers that have been since Christ's time, nay Wolves, and Sheep and all. It blends into one Mass the most heterogeneous and hitherto irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable Sects. Nay, it miraculously makes Light and Darkness very consistent, and <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Belial</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Friends. For your own Credit sake then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish your kind of Protestants (if you be indeed one of that Church) from that infamous Rabble of stigmatiz'd Hereticks; and let us know what is the Proper <hi>Difference</hi> that restrains that Notion of a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Rule to your <hi>particular,</hi> as such a kind of <hi>Protestant,</hi> and shew us that specifical Rule to be Absolutely Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. I say, <hi>such a kind</hi>; for even the word <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> too is a <hi>Subaltern Genus,</hi> and has divers <hi>Species,</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:44996:15"/>
and 'tis doubted by many, who are no Papists, under which Species you are to be rankt. But, why should I vex you with putting you upon manifest Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? For the Letter being the common Rule to them all, and, as daily experience shews us, variously explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that which particularizes it to belong specially to this or that Sect, as its <hi>proper</hi> Rule, can be only this, [<hi>According as my self, and those of my Iudgment under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand or interpret it.</hi>] The <hi>Difference</hi> then constituting <hi>your Protestant Rule,</hi> as distinguisht from that of those most abominable Heresies, can only be [<hi>as my own Iudgment, or others of my side, thus or thus interpret Scripture's Letter</hi>] and wriggle which way you please, there it will and must end at last. Go to work then, distinguish your self by your Ground of Faith, and then make out this your proper Rule to be <hi>Absolutely Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> or <hi>Infallible</hi>; and then, who will not laugh at you for attempting it, and assuming that to your self, which you deny to God's Church, and preferring your self as to the Gift of Understanding Scripture right, before the whole body of those many and Learned Churches in Communion with <hi>Rome?</hi> Nay, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Socinians too; without so much as pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make out to the World, that you have better Means, either Natural or Supernatural, to interpret those Sacred Oracles, than had the others.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. My last Exception is, that you pretend the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture is a Rule of Faith for your People, which not one in a Million, even of your own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants relies on; or ever thinks of relying on, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to make choice of their Faith, or determining what to hold. This pretence of yours looks so like a meer Jest, that I cannot perswade my self you are in earnest, when you advance such a Paradox. For, 'tis manifest
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44996:15"/>
that while <hi>your</hi> Protestants are under Age, and not yet at years of Discretion to judge, they simply believe their Fathers and Teachers; that is, they follow the way of Tradition, however misplac'd. And, when they come to Maturity, pray tell us truly, how many of your <hi>Sober Enquirers</hi> have you met with in your life, who endeavour to abstract from all the prejudices they have imbib'd in their Minority, and, reducing their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd thoughts to an equal Balance of Indifferency, do with a wise Jealousie, lest this Popish way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving immediate Fathers and Pastors should delude them, as it has done the whole World formerly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to examin the Book of Scripture it self, read it attentively, pray daily and fervently, that God's Spirit would discover to them, whether what they have learn'd hither to be true or no, and what is; and, in a word, use all the Fallible means (for you allow them no other) which your <hi>Sober Enquirers</hi> are to make use of to find out their Faith? I doubt, if you would please to answer sincerely, you would seriously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess you scarce ever met with such a one in your life; that is, never met with any one who <hi>rely'd</hi> upon Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture's Letter <hi>practically</hi> for his Rule of Faith, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you may have taught them to <hi>talk</hi> by rote. Can any Man of Reason imagin, that all the Reformed in <hi>Denmark</hi> or <hi>Sueden</hi> (to omit others) did light to be so unanimously of one Religion meerly by means of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your <hi>Letter-Rule,</hi> and your <hi>Sober Enquiry?</hi> Or can any be so blind, as not to see, that 'tis the following the natural way of Tradition, or Childrens believing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (that is, indeed, of Education) that such multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in several places, continue still of the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion; and that you consequently owe to this way, which you so decry in Catholics, that any considerable
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44996:16"/>
number of you do voluntarily hang together at all? And that those Principles of yours, which you take up for a shew, when you write against Catholics, would, if put in practice, in a short time crumble to Atoms all the Churches in the World? Perhaps, indeed, when your Protestants come at Age, they may receive some Confirmation from their Fathers and Preachers, quoting Scripture-places against what Catholics hold, or what they shall please to say they hold; and by the same means come to believe a Trinity, the Godhead of Christ, Christ's Body being absent in the Sacrament, and such like; but do the Hearers and Learners make it their business to use all careful disquisition (for a slubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing superficial diligence will not serve the turn in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of such high Concern) whether the Catholics, and those great Scripturists, who deny those other Points, do not give more congruous explications of those places than their own Preachers do? unless they do this, or something equivalent, 'tis manifest the Letter of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is not their Rule, but honest Tradition. And that they do no such thing, is hence very apparent, that they rest easily satisfi'd, and well appaid with their Parson's interpretation of Scripture, they presently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it for right and good, and readily swallow that sense, which some Learned Men, of their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, assign it, without thinking themselves oblig'd to observe your Method of <hi>Sober Enquiry.</hi> You may rail against the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as you will, for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding any to interpret Scripture against the Sense which the Church holds; but 'tis no more than what your Hearers perpetually practise, and the Preachers too (for all their fair words) expect from them. And I much doubt even your self (tho' your Principles are the most pernicious for taking matters out of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44996:16"/>
Churche's, and putting them into private Hands, of any Protestant I ever yet read) would not take it very well if some Parishioner of yours, presuming upon his Prayers for Direction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> should tell you that you err'd in Interpreting Scripture, and that the Sense he gave it, was sound and right Faith, yours wrong and Heretical; and I would be glad to know what you would say to him, according to your Principles, if he should hap to stand out against you, that he understands Scripture to be plainly against a Trinity and <hi>Christ</hi>'s Divinity, as <hi>Iohn Biddle</hi> did against the Minister of his Parish, and the whole Church of <hi>England</hi> to boot. 'Tis plain you ought to cherish and commend him for standing firm to his Rule; But I am much afraid you would be out of humor with him, and esteem your self affronted. You may pretend what you please of high Expressions given by Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of Scripture's incomparable Excellency, and Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency for the Ends it was intended for, which we do not deny to it; but I dare say, even your self do's not think, that either the Ancient Faithful, or the Modern Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, meant that any of the <hi>Ecclesia credens,</hi> or Believing Church, should have the liberty to Interpret Scripture against the <hi>Ecclesia docens,</hi> or Teaching Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> Pastors; or Coyn a Faith out of it, contrary to the present or former Congregation of which he was a Member.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. The sum is; 'Tis evident hence, that Tradition of your Fathers and Teachers, and not Scriptures Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is indeed your <hi>Rule</hi>; That by it you Interpret Scripture; which then only is call'd your Rule, and made use of as such, when you are Disputing against us; because having thus set it up, to avoid and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balance the Authority of the former Church you left, you make account your own private Interpretation of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44996:17"/>
it may come to be thought Argumentative against the great Body of those Churches from whose Communion you departed; and yet you judge no private Parishio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner should claim the same Priviledge against you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affronting your great Learning, and Pastoral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But I much wonder you should still venture to call Scripture's Letter a Rule of Faith, having been beaten from that Tenet so pitifully in <hi>Error Nonplust,</hi> from Pag. 59. to Pag. 72. where I believe you may observe divers Particulars requisit to be clear'd e're the Letter can be in all regards <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> which the Consent of all Christian Churches will never reach to by their meer Authority, unless you will allow the Sense of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Doctrin descending by Tradition, did preserve the Copy substantially right and intire.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Your pretended Rule of Faith then, being in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the same that is challeng'd by all the Heretics in the World, <hi>viz.</hi> Scripture's Letter Interpreted by your selves; I will let you see in this following short Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, how far it is from being Absolutely Certain.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>I.</hi> God has left us some Way to know surely what Christ and his Apostles taught.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>II.</hi> Therefore this Way must be such, that they who take it, shall arrive by it at the End it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for; that is, know surely what Christ and his Apostles taught.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>III.</hi> Scripture's Letter Interpretable by Private Iudgments, is not that Way; for we experience Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians and Socinians <hi>(for example)</hi> both take that Way, yet differ in such high Fundamentals, as the Trinity, and the Godhead of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:44996:17"/>
                     <hi>IV.</hi> Therefore Scripture's Letter Interpretable by Private Iudgments, is not the Way left by God to know surely what Christ and his Apostles taught, or surely to arrive at right Faith.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>V.</hi> Therefore they who take only that Way, cannot by it arrive surely at right Faith, since 'tis impossible to arrive at the End, without the Means or Way that leads to it.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. I do not expect any Answer to this Discourse, as short as it is, and as plain and as nearly as it touches your Copyhold; it may be serv'd as Mr. <hi>G's</hi> Argument is, turn'd off so so with an Instance, if there be one at hand; or, with what always is at hand, an Irony or scornful Jest, your readiest; and, in truth, most useful Servants: But you must be excus'd from finding any Proposition or Inference to deny, or any thing, save the Conclusion it self: Which, tho' it will not be fairly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, I cannot hope should be fairly admitted, unless I could hope that Men would be more in love with Truth than their Credit. Till Truth be taken a little more to heart, Catholic Arguments will and must always be faulty; but they are the most unluckily and crosly faulty of any in the World; faulty still in the wrong place. When fault is found in <hi>other</hi> Arguments, it is always found in the <hi>Premisses</hi>; in these, 'tis found in the <hi>Conclusion</hi>: In which, notwithstanding, all who know any thing of a Conclusion, know there can be no fault, if there be none in the Premisses. Indeed, they shew that to be true which Men cannot endure should be true; and that is their great and unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fault. That you may not think I talk in the Air,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44996:18"/>
I declare openly, that you <hi>cannot</hi> Answer this Discourse, unless you will call some unconcerning Return an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; and I engage my self to shew the Proposition true, and the Inference good, which you shall pitch upon to deny; And the Distinction, if you will make any, not to purpose. The truth is, I engage for no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for I know beforehand you can no more Answer now, than you could to <hi>Error Nonplust,</hi> or can prove an Absolute Certainty in Protestant Faith.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. To return now to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> the Second thing which you desire him to make good, is, <hi>That the Tradition from Father to Son is an infallible Conveyance of Matters of Faith, notwithstanding the Greek Church is charged by</hi> him <hi>with Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, which adher'd to Tradition.</hi> That is, you desire him to prove over again, what you tell us your self he has prov'd once already: For you tell us (<hi>p.</hi> 5.), he prov'd, That <hi>they</hi> [Traditionary Christians] <hi>could not innovate in Faith, unless they did forget what they held the day before, or out of malice alter it.</hi> Pray, when it is prov'd, that the Conveyance of Faith by Tradition, excludes the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of Change in Faith, save by forgetfulness or malice, is it not prov'd, That, where there could be neither forgetfulness nor malice, there could be no change in Faith? You do not, I suppose, desire he should prove, that Men had always Memories, or that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were never malicious enough to damn themselves and Posterity wittingly; and yet it can stick no where else: If it can, said Mr. <hi>G.</hi> assign where. Now you know very well, that a Conveyance which makes it impossible that Faith should ever be chang'd, is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Conveyance; and the very thing is prov'd which you desire should be prov'd. What reason has Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to prove it a second time? And what reason have you to desire it? If Proof would content you,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44996:18"/>
you have it already; but a second cannot hope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you better than the first, unless it be worse.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Yes, but you would have him prove, <hi>Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Greek Church,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>p.</hi> 7.) <hi>Notwithstanding?</hi> Why, do you think it is with Arguments as with Writs, where the want of a <hi>Non obstante</hi> spoils all? When a Truth is once prov'd, is it not prov'd, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Objections? And will any <hi>Notwithstanding</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it again? Will your <hi>Notwithstanding</hi> shew us there was a time in which Men were not Men, nor acted like Men? Will it shew us, that a thing which cannot possibly be chang'd, may yet possibly remain not the same? Will it shew us, that a Cause can be without its Effect, or an Effect without its Cause? Will it shew us, that a thing can be and not be at once? Unless it can do such Feats as these, you may keep your <hi>Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> to your self, for any Service it will do you here: For all the <hi>Notwithstandings</hi> in the world cannot hinder a thing which is true, from being true; nor the Proof which proves it to be true, from being a Proof. Mr. G<hi>'s</hi> Proof shews, that Tradition from Father to Son is an Infallible Conveyance of Faith, as plainly, as that Men are Men: And would you persuade us with the Rhetorick of your <hi>Notwithstanding,</hi> that we do not see what we see? Tho' you had brought twenty of them instead of one, we could see nothing by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that you had a good Fancy; for they shew us nothing of the Object, nor offer at it. You shew us not how the Operations of Human Nature should be suspended in our present Case, nor any thing which should or could suspend them, but would have us believe Men were prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously forgetful or malicious, purely for the sake of an Imagination of yours. I pray rub up afresh your old
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44996:19"/>
Logical Notions, and reflect whether it were ever heard of in University Disputes, that when an Argument is advanc'd, the Defendant is allow'd to make Objections against it; and instead of Answering, bid the Arguer prove his Conclusions to be true, <hi>Notwithstanding</hi> all his Objections? Consider how perfectly this confounds the Offices of the Disputant and Defendent, and makes all Regular Discourse impossible. Consider how this new Method of yours destroys the very possibility of ever concluding any thing, that is, the very Faculty of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning; For Objections being generally multipliable without end, if all of them must be Solv'd e're any Argument concludes, nothing will be concluded, nor any Conclusion admitted: And so a long so Farewel to Rational Nature. Consider that Truth is built on its own Intrinsecal Grounds, and not on the Solving Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections. For your own Credits sake then with Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men and Logicians, do not seek to evade with <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstandings,</hi> but Answer fairly and squarely to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument as it lies: Consider, that who has found the <hi>Cause,</hi> has found the <hi>Effect.</hi> Mr. <hi>G.</hi> has found us a <hi>Cause</hi> of Infallible Conveyance, and therefore has shew'd us an Infallible Conveyance. You pretend, that tho' there was the Cause, there was not the Effect; and this 'tis known beforehand cannot be, and you knew it as well as any body: But you knew likewise there was no saving your Stakes without playing a new Game; and therefore, give you your due, did all that could be done, in trying to divert our sight from a Matter plain before us, and amuse us us with a Matter of Fact, which you are sure will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure enough, by that time it is handled long enough. The Terms you put, viz. <hi>Tradition, Error,</hi> and the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44996:19"/>
                     <hi>Greek Church,</hi> must needs bring into Dispute, whether such and so many Quotations, or some one or two Men disclaiming their Tenet to be a Novelty, be a Proof of Tradition from Father to Son; whether the Error be any Error; and whether, and for how much, an Error in <hi>Faith,</hi> and how much of it belongs to <hi>Divinity</hi>; whether the Greek Church be ingag'd by a Citation from a Greek Author; of two that be cited, one against another, which shall be preferr'd, and thought to speak the sense of his Church; and which is a Latiniz'd, which a frank Grecian. And who shall see through the Mists which these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes will raise? More too will fall in in process of time: There will be wrangling about the sense of Words, the propriety of Phrases, the preference of Readings, and twenty such important quarrels; which will tire out every body, and satisfie no body. In short, you saw that if you could perswade People not to think the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Infallible, till all be said, which will occur to be said of the Greek Church, you are safe enough; For Doomsday will come before that day. Till then you may carry it with a shew of Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, because there must be abundance of Greek ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>PErhaps it has scarce been seen hitherto, that all our Polemical Contests were reduc'd within so narrow a compass. My First Letter insisted chiefly on Two short Discourses: Whereof the one undertook to shew the Nullity of the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> claim'd by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and <hi>his</hi> Protestants. The other the <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> of the <hi>Catholic Rule</hi>; and the whole Controversie was, in short, about the <hi>Certainty</hi> or <hi>Uncertainty</hi> of <hi>Christian Faith.</hi> Both of those Discourses were presum'd by us to be <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi>; and so we offer'd a fair Advantage to our Adversary, if he could shew clearly any of our Propositions was false, or their Connexion slack. Hence I had good hopes that Reply of mine would have brought our Controversie very near an end, had Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s Return been suitable to our Attempts. Especially, it had brought the Business to a <hi>Crisis,</hi> had he been pleas'd to shew the Absolute Certainty of his <hi>Rule,</hi> or of his <hi>Faith,</hi> as grounded on that Rule, which was justly expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But <hi>Error Nonplust</hi> has already convinc'd the World, That the bringing any Dispute to <hi>Principles</hi> or Grounds, agrees not with their Constitution who have <hi>none.</hi> While our Expectations were thus rais'd, no News could we hear of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> An Answer comes out from another hand; not very obliging to him in my opinion, whether he were or were not preacquainted with it: For if he were (and 'tis hard to
<pb facs="tcp:44996:22"/>
imagine that a Piece writ in his Defence had not both his Direction, Inspection, and Approbation) People will suspect he foresaw what would come of it, and was glad the Shame should fall on another; and that he has but little Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for his Friend, whom he suffers to Write on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If he were not, they will suspect his Friends have as little Kindness for <hi>him,</hi> and less Regard, who manage his Cause without his Privity. However it be, the Answer affords no work for a Replier, but the most ungrateful one in the World; to be perpetually telling men of their Faults, without the least hopes of doing them good, or contributing to their amendment; They being of such a nature, that they are our Adversaries most necessary supports in their unlucky circumstances. And indeed, the whole Piece seems to have no other Design, but to bring the Dispute into a Wrangle. Yet this Profit may be hoped, that every moderate Iudgment will see by the very methods we take, which side desires and sincerely endeavours that <hi>Truth</hi> may appear. It would be much a greater, if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> or whom he pleases to employ, would <hi>plainly shew</hi> the <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> which he <hi>says</hi> they <hi>have</hi>; or else <hi>plainly confess</hi> they <hi>have it not.</hi> But this is not to be hoped. Yet I entreat the Reader, because I distrust my own Credit, to sollicit him (if he thinks it not too dangerous for him) to do the one or the other; and in doing it, to use as much <hi>Reason</hi> as he <hi>will,</hi> and as little <hi>Laughing</hi> as he <hi>can.</hi> We are sufficiently satisfy'd of his faculty of <hi>Risibility,</hi> and would be glad to see a touch or two of his <hi>Rationality.</hi>

                  <head>REFLECTIONS ON Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s Reflecters Defence Addrest to Himself.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. I Enquire not, Sir, since it concerns me not to know, why you would needs become a Party, or rather an Advocate in a Cause, depending between Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and another. If it were <hi>desir'd</hi> of you, you are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd, so you perform well what you undertook; that is, to <hi>defend</hi> the Dr. especially his <hi>Logick,</hi> and his <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi>; But if you had nothing to <hi>draw you in,</hi> besides the Weight of what you had to say, I think you might very well have <hi>kept out.</hi> You begin like a man of Art, with prepossessing your Reader against your Adversary, and in favour of your self: and so would have me pass for a pleasant, artificial, deluding Companion; and your self for a man, <hi>Godly</hi> even to <hi>scruple,</hi> and who cannot barely repeat the Metaphor (of <hi>holding ones Cards</hi>) without <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 2.</note> asking <hi>Pardon.</hi> The Reader will find, by your writing, to which of us your former Character is most like. In the mean time, I own the Confidence of talking of Self-evidence, and Absolute Certainty, and Infallibility; and bless the Mercy of God, for making me of a Communion, in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44996:23"/>
which that Language is Proper; and humbly pray Him to preserve me from the <hi>Face</hi> (if I must not say <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>) of setting up for a Guide without them. For, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a <hi>blind Guide,</hi> and one who <hi>sees not his way,</hi> I think the difference is not great. Much good may your <hi>Modesty</hi> do you; your <hi>Obscurity;</hi> your <hi>Vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Fallibility.</hi> If your Conscience perswade you these are the best qualifications of Christan Doctrin, and best Security which God would provide for the Souls of men, mine would sooner use Twenty Metaphors, than perswade People to venture their Eternity upon them. But, at worst, it is no greater fault in me sure, than in <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Dr.</hi> St<hi>'s first Letter,</hi> p. 7. <hi>&amp; second,</hi> p. 14.</note> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> to talk of <hi>Absolute Certainty.</hi> Unless he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>repent,</hi> and would be content an unfortunate Word inconsiderately blurted out, should be <hi>retracted</hi> for him by <hi>another,</hi> which 'tis not so handsome to retract <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>; whereas I, like a man of Confidence, <hi>meant</hi> what I <hi>said,</hi> and <hi>stand to it</hi>; and can have no good opinion of those <hi>modest</hi> men, that say and unsay, as sutes with the occasion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To fall to our Business, your Discourse has Three Parts. The First reflects on what I said of turning Proof over from your <hi>Protestants</hi> to <hi>Catholicks</hi>: The Second pretends to answer my Argument; And the Third, Mr. <hi>G's.</hi> Some <hi>Gleanings</hi> in your Language there are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides; but this is the main Crop. Upon the first Point, since Proof does or does not belong to Protestants, there is nothing more to be said to purpose, but either to shew that Proof does not belong to them, or to bring it if it does. But let us see how you handle the matter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I had exprest my self to grieve and wonder there should be so little value for Souls among your Party, as to send Men to the Tribunal of God, <hi>without furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with assurance that they can justifie their Accounts themselves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:44996:23"/>
                     <hi>But if</hi> (say you) <hi>they may be assured they can give up a good account,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 3.</note> 
                     <hi>may they not be assur'd that they have the Grace of God, and of their Iustification and Salvation? And then what becomes of the Council of</hi> Trent? Of what <hi>Account</hi> do you speak, I beseech you? If, as I did, of an Account of <hi>Faith,</hi> I hope you will not perswade us a man cannot know <hi>why he believes,</hi> without knowing whether he be in the State of <hi>Grace,</hi> or <hi>sure</hi> of his Salvation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 4.</note> I hope you will not persist to think it <hi>hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how the bare assurance of the Truth of what is taught, should enable a man to justifie his account, without an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of Grace too</hi>; since his very <hi>Assurance</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> which he believes is a <hi>Iustification of his Account,</hi> for <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> it. If you speak of an Account of our <hi>whole lives,</hi> it becomes you huge well to talk of my <hi>Confidence,</hi> who have your self the Confidence to turn things against the plain Scope of my Discourse, against my plain Words, and (I much fear) against your own Knowledge. For where the only Question was of the Certainty of Protestant Faith, or (which is all one) of Christian Faith, upon <hi>your</hi> Protestant Grounds: an Account why your Protestants believe, who cannot tell whether Christ taught it, was the only Account that belongs to that Question. But what needs more? Are not you, I too, fully perswaded, while we are writing this very Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, that we maintain the Truth of our Faith by such arguments as can justifie us not to have fail'd of <hi>that</hi> Duty; and if we do so, cannot both us justifie our selves in that particular, and all who assent upon them, to God as well as man? And cannot either of us bring a solid Argument to prove that Christ Taught what we hold, without being assur'd before-hand we are in the state of <hi>Grace,</hi> and shall be <hi>sav'd</hi>? Or, Is this any thing to the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> as you pretend? What paltring is this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44996:24"/>
then, to pretend, that no Controvertist can bring a Proof that concludes Christ Taught such a Doctrin, and so justifies them that adhere to the Truth it evinces; for fear (forsooth) of making men sure of their <hi>Iustification</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> and of contradicting the <hi>Council of Trent.</hi> A pretty fetch, to excuse your selves from bringing any Arguments worth a Straw to justifie your Followers, for believing upon them! Alas! you have store enough of them; but out of pure Conscience (we must think) dare not produce them, for fear of <hi>enabling</hi> your People to <hi>justifie</hi> themselves for not believing rashly; or for fear of making them <hi>sure of their Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. I had alledg'd farther, that till Protestants pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Grounds which prove their Faith to be <hi>True,</hi> it cannot with Reason be held <hi>Truth.</hi> You put my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course first in my Words, only leaving out those which did not please you, and then disguise it in your own, and laugh at it for being <hi>too plainly</hi> True: For <hi>plain Truth,</hi> it seems, is a <hi>ridiculous</hi> thing with you; and you are of opinion, that the more plain it is, that you ought to bring your <hi>Proofs,</hi> the less you are oblig'd to bring them. Thence you start aside to tell us, that <hi>the vulgar</hi> Catholic <hi>has less certainty than the vulgar</hi> Protestant; because the one has only the <hi>Word of his Priest,</hi> the other <hi>has the Word of his Minister and the Word of God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture besides.</hi> Do you think Catholic Priests are at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to tell the vulgar what Faith they please, as your Ministers may interpret Scripture as seems best to their Judgment of Discretion! when you cannot but know, they dare not teach them any Faith, but what the Church holds; nor does the Church hold any but upon Tradition? Again, You do well to say your People have it in <hi>Scripture,</hi> or in a <hi>Book</hi>; for they have it no where else. And you know the vulgar <hi>Socinians</hi> and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44996:24"/>
                     <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and all the rest, have it as much there, as your vulgar <hi>Protestants,</hi> notwithstanding all you have said, or can say; and then, I suppose, you do not think they Truly have the Word of God on their side, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you think the Word of God says different things to different Hearers. When you prove that you and your Ministers have any Certain means of making it out, that the Sense, which by their <hi>explaining</hi> and <hi>catechising</hi> they put upon the Written Characters, is <hi>truly</hi> God's <hi>Meaning,</hi> you will do something, make many Converts, and my self one among the rest: Till then, to possess your vulgar Protestants with a Conceit of having the Word of God, is meerly to delude them. Sure you wanted a Common-place to furnish out your Paragraph, or else writ it in a Dream. For, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 5.</note> to tell me, that <hi>Truth can depend no more</hi> upon the <hi>Saying of a</hi> Romish <hi>Priest, than of an</hi> English <hi>Minister,</hi> when I tell you, it depends <hi>not</hi> on <hi>any</hi> private man's <hi>Sayings,</hi> is not a Reply of a man well awake. In two words, <hi>Bring you Proofs,</hi> say I; <hi>the Saying,</hi> that is, the <hi>No-proof of a Minister,</hi> is as good as the <hi>No-proof of a Priest,</hi> say you; And the short and the long is; <hi>No Proof, I thank you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. But <hi>two things,</hi> say you, <hi>follow from my Position,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>which you fear I will not grant. The First is, That if we cannot with Reason hold a Truth till the Intrinsical Grounds of it be produc'd, we cannot with reason hold any thing for a Truth, namely, because the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it; for her Determination is no Intrinsical Ground of the Truth, but only an outward Testimony or Declaration of it; and then what's become either of her Infallibility or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to command our Faith!</hi> As slips of honest Ignorance deserve compassion and instruction, and I do not know this to be any more, I will be so charitable, as to set you right. <hi>Authority,</hi> amongst those who already admit it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44996:25"/>
for <hi>True,</hi> has Force to prove that to be <hi>Truth,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on it, and will conclude against those who allow its veracity, if it be shewn to be engag'd against them. But it has not this Effect upon <hi>Human</hi> Nature by its proper Power as 'tis meer <hi>Authority</hi>; but, because <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsical Mediums</hi> justifie it to be worthy to be rely'd on. Whence, let that Authority come into dispute, it will lose it's Credit, unless it can be prov'd by <hi>such Mediums</hi> to deserve what it pretends to. And, hence, you see we go about to demonstrate the Infallibility of the Church's <hi>Human Authority,</hi> in deriving down Christian Faith. To clear this farther, I advance this Fundamental Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>viz. No Authority deserves any Assent farther than Reason gives it to deserve:</hi> And, therefore, without aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing of our respect, we may affirm, that the Authority of the whole Catholick Church would be no greater than that of an old Woman, (or one of your sober Enquirers) were there <hi>no more Reason</hi> to be given for believing the <hi>former,</hi> than there is for believing the <hi>later.</hi> And consonantly to this Doctrin, we declare to you, that, When Dr. <hi>St.</hi> comes to argue, either out of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Writers, or Instances depending on their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, against Tradition; he shall be prest to make out by <hi>Intrinsical Mediums</hi> they are <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi>; or they shall deservedly be look'd upon and contemn'd as <hi>Inconclusive.</hi> By this time, I hope, you see that <hi>All Truths</hi> are built on <hi>Intrinsical Mediums</hi>; and, that whereas you apprehended they would <hi>overthrow</hi> our Church's Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony or Authority, such <hi>Mediums</hi> (in case we produce them) are the best means to establish it, and give it force upon our selves and others: As also, how it comes that the Church can <hi>oblige to Belief:</hi> which is not by a dry <hi>commanding our Faith,</hi> as you apprehend; but by having its Human Authority so solidly grounded upon Reason,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44996:25"/>
that it self becomes a Motive able to beget, according to the best Maxims of Rational Nature, such an Assent in us, to this <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> that Christ and his Apostles taught such Doctrins. But, what a put off is this? We say Truth is not therefore Truth, because of mens bare <hi>Sayings</hi> or <hi>Authority</hi>; and therefore demand your Proofs from <hi>Intrinsical Mediums,</hi> (for thither it must come, e're it be known for Truth) to make out what you pretend; Your Answer, in effect, is, You are <hi>afraid</hi> to do it, lest you should destroy our Church's Infallibility and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. How much is our Church in your Debt, that the Care of Her makes you careless of those Souls in your own Church, to whom you owe this satisfaction.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The second thing you fear I will not grant, is, <hi>A Iudgment of Discretion to common People,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 5.</note> with which they may <hi>discern the Intrinsical Grounds of Truth.</hi> You gave your self at first the Character of a scrupulous man; and I see by this, you have a mind to maintain it. You know, that those who <hi>write</hi> and <hi>print,</hi> can have no design their Books should not be <hi>read</hi>; and you know those that <hi>read,</hi> will and must <hi>judge</hi> of what they do read; and yet your scrupulosity can <hi>fear</hi> I will not allow the Common People to <hi>judge</hi> of the Intrinsical Grounds of Truth, who take pains they may judge, put it into their power to judge, and out of my own, and so cannot hinder them, tho' I would. Indeed, I think it no great sign of a Judgment of Discretion, to pretend to discern the <hi>Truth</hi> of Faith, by Lights that do not shew it to be <hi>True</hi>; and, upon such a Judgment I wish and labour People should not venture their Souls. But I disallow no other <hi>Iudgment of Discretion</hi>; full well knowing, that the more Judgment a man has, and the more he uses it, the sooner and better he will discern, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Christ cannot be securely learnt from those of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44996:26"/>
Your and Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s Principles. But, Why all this? Or, How come I to stand in your way? Do I hinder you from shewing <hi>Protestants</hi> that <hi>They</hi> are Certain of their Faith? <hi>They</hi> allow a Judgment of Discretion, if it stick there, whether <hi>I</hi> do or no. But you cannot gratifie Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics with Proof, it seems, because they are <hi>against</hi> Judgment of Discretion; nor Protestants, because they are for it; that is, in plain terms, you will not prove the Certainty of your Faith at all. You conclude very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably, that <hi>I</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">P. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>have set us all on even Ground</hi>: Yes, most Mathematically <hi>even:</hi> For I set <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> on the one side, and <hi>Vncertainty</hi> on the other; and this, in your Language, is <hi>even Ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <note place="margin">P. 6.</note>7. Your next Paragraph says, <hi>I fall upon the Certainty of Protestant Faith</hi>; which I hope easily to <hi>overthrow.</hi> The Reader cannot but apprehend now, that I am ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Arguments against it, of which you know very well I did not think. Where do I fall upon this Matter! Why, I said, <hi>Suppose Mr.</hi> G. <hi>could not prove Protestants are certain, are they therefore certain?</hi> The meaning of which words is clearly this, that the Certainty of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Faith must depend on their own Proofs for it, not on any Man's being able or not able to prove the contrary, which is what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> would have put upon us. So that (to avoid proving, which was demanded) you put upon me the direct contrary to what I affirm'd, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Certainty of Protestant Faith <hi>does</hi> depend upon our not <hi>proving</hi> they have none; whereas I contend it does not depend upon it. What shifts are you put to, that you may escape this dangerous business of <hi>proving</hi> your Faith Certain. Well, but did I say true, or no? You trouble not your Head with such impertinent thoughts, but fall to prophesie what I <hi>imagin'd. This</hi> (say you) <hi>he first imagins, that all the certainty of our Faith is this, That Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44996:26"/>
cannot prove it to be uncertain,</hi> and that <hi>then I make sport with my own Imagination.</hi> Better and better! Not to take notice of your shuffling in, that Papists cannot prove Protestants are not Certain, which I am very far from <hi>imagining</hi>; because I said our <hi>not-proving</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is <hi>no</hi> Certainty to Protestants, he will have me <hi>imagin</hi> it <hi>is</hi> their Certainty; nay, <hi>All their Certainty:</hi> when he knows I am aware, and confess they pretend to Scripture for it; and, <hi>p.</hi> 26. urg'd them to make out they had Absolute Certainty by <hi>It.</hi> The rest is, to tell me I play, and you will be serious: And your way of being serious, when you have chosen to fall upon this Question, whether Protestants become Certain by our not proving them Uncertain, is, without saying a word to it, to skip to another Paragraph of mine.</p>
                  <p n="8">8.

                     <hi>You seem to grant you are thus</hi> Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely-Certain <hi>or Infallible, by vertue of Tradition.</hi> Upon which Theme you thus declame. <hi>How? confess we have no Certainty</hi> (no <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> I beseech you again) <hi>and yet seem to grant we are Infallible, and that too by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Tradition. —Some people had need of good Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</hi> As if it were so strange a thing for Protestants to contradict one another, or the same man himself; or, that there needed Memory to observe what passes every day.

                     <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 15.</note> And in his First Letter he did desire Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to <hi>prove that they have no Absolute Certainty as to the Rule of their Faith,</hi>

Scripture) <hi>is so ancient as it pretends to be, or that it was written by him whose Name it bears; or, that this is the sence of such and such passages in it: It is possible all this may be otherwise.</hi> Now, if one of those Writers do not seem to grant that they are <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> (or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible) and that too by vertue of <hi>Tradition,</hi> and the Other confess, that they have <hi>no Absolute Certainty</hi> of their Faith, English is no intelligible Language in <hi>England.</hi> If you think this a Contradiction, you may talk with your <hi>excellent men</hi> about it, and let me alone; till you can shew I talk against my self by relating barely what others say. Must my Memory be blam'd, when their Judgments are in fault? For a Contradiction it is, if <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely Certain</hi> and <hi>Infallible</hi> be the same; which I both prov'd formerly, and it will come into play again e're long.

good against that Dr's Excuse, in <hi>Reason against Railery, p.</hi> 227. to <hi>p.</hi> 234. And were it seasonable, perhaps we should find the others <hi>abus'd</hi> too, or wilfully misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. But, What is this to our present business? At last, you conclude with a <hi>seasonable Warning,</hi> as you call it; That,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>if any Protestant shall begin to plead Infallibility by Vertue of Tradition, it will behove Catholicks in time to seek cut a new one.</hi> Why so, I beseech you! This is as much as to say, that, as soon as Protestants take a fancy to any thing that belongs to Catholicks, it is <hi>their own,</hi> and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks must presently yield it up. Your reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>When both Parties pretend alike to Infallibility and Tradition, neither of these can be any longer a fit Medium to prove which is in the Right.</hi> What will be when both <hi>pretend alike,</hi> we shall see when the Time comes. But, Why must they, or how can they <hi>pretend alike?</hi> Can Tradition infallibly deliver contrary things? Why should <hi>Tradition</hi> be a <hi>Medium</hi> less fit to determine between Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Protestant, which of them has right to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi> when both pretend to it by Tradition, than a <hi>Deed</hi> to determine between <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> which has right to the Estate, which both claim by the same <hi>Deed?</hi> Do their contrary Pretences hinder it from being seen whether the <hi>Deed</hi> be for <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi>; or <hi>Tradition</hi> for Catholicks or Protestants? Or do you think a Protestant, to get <hi>Tradition</hi> on his side, has no more to do, but to <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> to it. At this rate, Scripture cannot be a fit <hi>Medium</hi> for you, because all Hereticks pretend to it, and <hi>alike</hi> too. But it seems, that with you, when two pretend, One with Right, the Other without it, they both pretend <hi>alike,</hi> or with equal Title. Of which it was, indeed, <hi>seasonable</hi> to <hi>warn us</hi>; for neither we, (nor any man well in his wits) would have hit on it of our selves. Thus much in return to your present Excursion. But what's become of your
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44996:28"/>
Proof all this while? Instead of bringing that, you tell me, <hi>I fall upon Protestant Certainty,</hi> of which there was not the least shew; that <hi>I speak against my self</hi>; that <hi>Dr.</hi> Tillotson <hi>is an Excellent man,</hi> that he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Out of which rambling Talk we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, That your Protestant Proof needs not appear; but to make us amends for this constant Neglect, you will needs give us a <hi>seasonable Warning</hi>; and that's worth all the Proof in the World.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Yet we shall have this Proof, I hope, in the next Paragraph: For you give me notice then, <hi>When your Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty (Absolute Certainty,</hi>

Yet it bodes ill, that you would have the word [<hi>Absolutely</hi>] left out a while: A motion which would make a jealous man suspect you had a design to palm a Certainty upon us which will prove <hi>no-Certainty.</hi> But you are <hi>Absolute</hi> Master of your own Proofs, and may put in and put out what you please. I, for my part, cannot consent to leave that word out; because it is not <hi>fair</hi> to alter a word of Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s; nor <hi>possible,</hi> tho' it were <hi>fair.</hi> For you and I cannot make him <hi>not have said</hi> what he <hi>has said</hi>; and, tho' we should agree to <hi>suppress</hi> that Word amongst our selves, it will still be found in his <hi>Two Letters,</hi> do what we can. But, now we are thus far onward, 'tis pity to break for a single Word; and to give you your due, you begin to deal here very fair with us. <hi>We manifest,</hi> say you. Very well: Now the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is on the Hinges again; and here is not only <hi>Proof,</hi> but <hi>Manifest Proof</hi> coming. But what is it which you <hi>manifest?</hi> Why, <hi>the Certainty you have of Scripture</hi>;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and

that, <hi>after the same manner as we do our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> Rule or Scripture, I know not which you mean. But, I see you need a <hi>good Memory</hi> too as well as your Neighbours: For you do not remember that <hi>Absolute Certainty of Scripture</hi> is not the Point to be prov'd, tho' I told you so in the very page you cite. I wav'd that point, not to be more severe than needs and put Protestants upon a Task which I told them withal <hi>They</hi> would find a hard one; but from which, while we both agree that Scripture is Certain, I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to excuse them. Again, You forget that just before you wonder'd at me for saying, <hi>You seem to grant you are thus Absolutely Certain or Infallible by vertue of Tradition</hi>; and now you say, <hi>you manifest your Certainty in the same manner as we do</hi>; and sure you do not forget, that <hi>Our manner of manifesting is by Tradition.</hi> But, to lose no more time about that which <hi>is not</hi> the point, pray How do you <hi>prove</hi> that which is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <note place="margin">P. 9</note> he says, <hi>prove two things more: First, that they are absolutely certain of All This.</hi> By the way, I take for granted, that by <hi>All This,</hi> you mean All which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> affirm'd, which was All of which I desir'd <hi>Proof.</hi> And Secondly, <hi>Not only this, but of All that more which Our Saviour taught his Apostles.</hi> Of this Charge I own the first half. I did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand proof of <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> and that for <hi>All This</hi>; and shall persist to demand it, till you shew me the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation-Law-Book, which allows a Disputant to <hi>say</hi> what he pleases, and <hi>chuse</hi> whether he will <hi>prove</hi> it or no when he has done. Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> did affirm, that <hi>You are Absolutely Certain</hi>; and, absolutely Certain that <hi>you now hold All the same Doctrin that was Taught by Christ &amp; his Apostles.</hi> And of <hi>All this,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s second Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note> all the Laws of Disputation that I ever read or heard of, warrant me to demand proof:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44996:30"/>
And you shall permit me to believe there was something in the Wind, besides those <hi>Laws,</hi> which makes you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to give it. I had been Logician good enough, if you had known how to have <hi>prov'd.</hi> Yes, but I make <hi>Absolutely-Certain</hi> and <hi>Infallible</hi> all one. I make them all one! Why, all Mankind made them so before I was born. Take all the Men who pretend to Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and all the ways by which they pretend; Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, Demonstration, Sense, Experience, or what you will; and see whether all Mankind agree not, that when there is room for <hi>Deceit,</hi> there is no <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi>; and let a man pretend to be Absolutely Certain as much as he will, if he <hi>be,</hi> or <hi>may be deceiv'd,</hi> he will be but laught at for his pains, and not thought <hi>Absolutely Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> by any man in the World, no not by your <hi>Reflecting</hi> self. And yet you would perswade us I break the Laws of Disputation by understanding that Word as every body else does. Certainly, you would make a pleasant Law-maker for <hi>Disputation:</hi> For when you have forbid us to understand words as others do, we could <hi>dispute</hi> no longer, nor so much as <hi>converse;</hi> for there would be no knowing one anothers meaning.</p>

Since you leave me to my self, I shall, at the hazard of incurring again the Penalties of your Laws of <hi>Disputation,</hi> venture to think that He, who will not suffer those who are Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44996:30"/>
Certain to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> will have them <hi>Fallible</hi>; that is, <hi>Deceivable</hi> in that whereof they are Absolutely Certain; and for ought they can tell, <hi>actually deceiv'd.</hi> And then he will have Protestants believe that their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the same that is taught by Christ, <hi>stand firm,</hi> and <hi>draw over</hi> to it as many as they can, and vex and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute their Neighbours whom they <hi>cannot</hi>; prefer it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Unity of the Church, and keep up differences in Religion with as much jealous Concern, as if the Wall of Division in the Church were the only safe Fence of the Nation; in a word, stake their Souls and Eternity upon it: When, all the while, he cannot Absolutely tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>True</hi> or <hi>No</hi>; nay, <hi>knows</hi> he <hi>cannot.</hi> Let him honestly tell Protestants so; and if they will venture Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, and Schism, and Salvation on those terms, the Fault is their own, and he has wash'd his Hands: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, he deludes them shamefully. If they waver, and stand upon Security, they are <hi>told,</hi> they are <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> and this <hi>confirms</hi> them; for it is as good Security as Heart can wish: But, when it comes to be sifted, it appears they <hi>may be deceiv'd</hi> for all their Security; and their <hi>Absolutely-Certain</hi> Religion proves to be such as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is <hi>arrantly False.</hi> In short, they have a bare Sound to rely upon for their Souls. Call their Security <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Certain,</hi> and 'tis good <hi>Protestant Doctrin</hi>; but call it <hi>Infallible,</hi> (which is the same) and 'tis rank <hi>Popery,</hi> and your Protestants will none of it. And so, they may if they will, and <hi>must</hi> if they will continue to be of your principles, be content with Sounds: But, if they will stand upon <hi>Security from Deceit,</hi> they must look for it where it is to be had: With all they can get here, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains <hi>They may be Deceiv'd.</hi>

With this stuff you face it out,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that <hi>You prove Scripture to be the Word of God</hi>; which, if one should put you to it, you cannot; and <hi>every Article of your Faith by the Scripture</hi> (common words, which every Heretick may and does use); when I have been all this while sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with all the earnestness I can, to know which way you can prove <hi>any</hi> Article with Absolute Certainty by Scripture; and you will not tell me, and I am sure, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. Though you have the Confidence to say you <hi>do it,</hi> yet every body may perceive <hi>you know you cannot.</hi> For
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44996:32"/>
your very next words are, <hi>Thus we prove we have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Certainty of our whole Faith</hi>; which is to say, You decline Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> nor know of any way to prove more than <hi>sufficient Certainty.</hi> And this suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Certainty of yours may be <hi>no-Certainty</hi>: For there goes no more to make a thing <hi>sufficient,</hi> than to make a man content with it. A Yard of Cloth will make a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Garment for him who is content to go half naked; and a Table without Meat is a sufficient Meal for him who is contented to fast. And so, as long as you can prevail with your Protestants to be content <hi>without Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> you can prove they have Certainty abundantly Sufficient, because <hi>no-Certainty</hi> will <hi>suffice.</hi> Marry, if they will insist upon having at least this Sufficient Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty which you promise, I know not how you will do without Weights and Scales to weigh out your Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, according to several mens Exigencies, and make down-weight Sufficient, except they will take your word; for you have no more to give them even for so much: But, for <hi>Absolute True Certainty,</hi> the only Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of which Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> spake and I demanded Proof, They must absolutely excuse you. Poor Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, to be thus us'd! That <hi>Empty Words</hi> and <hi>solemn Outsides,</hi> and <hi>Confident Noise,</hi> should be offer'd to them for Truth, and, which is more deplorable, <hi>pass upon them!</hi> That they should not yet perceive they are but the Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems of those <hi>no-principled</hi> men, who impose on them, and secretly laugh at them for their Easiness; and yet reflect not that they must answer one day with their souls, for suffering themselves to be so impos'd upon.</p>

From your <hi>Proving</hi> Talent you pass to your <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering</hi> Talent; and will try to answer a Discourse of mine, in which there are but <note n="*" place="margin">See my first Letter, P. 30.</note> Five Propositions. The First, [<hi>God has left us some way to know surely what Christ
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44996:32"/>
and his Apostles taught.</hi>] This you grant to be a <hi>Certain Truth:</hi> and so there is one step of our Journey made. I think you grant the second too, not that you positively say <hi>I</hi> or <hi>No</hi>; for that is too precise &amp; dull a Method for a Man of your parts: But as <hi>Plain Truth</hi> seems always ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to you; you laugh at it for a foolish Inference, because 'tis so visibly in the Antecedent. You are not aware I perceive, that your Raillery is Complement. To be contain'd in the Antecedent, which you make the <hi>Fault,</hi> is the <hi>Praise</hi> of an Inference; without which it would indeed be good for nothing, or rather not be at all. For which way can an Inference be <hi>drawn</hi> from an Antecedent, in which <hi>it was not</hi> to be drawn? Would you have us draw Wine out of an empty Cask, or Beer out of a Jarr of Oyl. Again, the more we know the thing <hi>is where</hi> we would draw it, the surer our Draught. But you seem to be so little acquainted with Antecedents &amp; Inferences, that 'tis no wonder; by making them your sport, you make your self the sport of those who <hi>do</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand them. In the mean time your laughing is own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Inference <hi>is contain'd</hi> in the Antecedent, and therefore <hi>Certain,</hi> as you before own'd the Antecedent was. And so we are another step onwards; and might so forwards without stopping longer, if you could have let my Proposition alone. But, you must needs be word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on't your own way, to shew that either you did not understand it, or that you had a mind to inform us how neatly and dexterously you could <hi>change</hi> and pervert words, as well as <hi>Answer.</hi> My Words were: <hi>Therefore this way must be such that they who take it, shall arrive by it at the End it was intended for; that is, know surely what</hi> Christ <hi>and his</hi> Apostles <hi>taught.</hi> Your Words which you pretend equivalent to mine, are these: <note n="*" place="margin">P. 12.</note> [<hi>If God has left us a Way to know, then by that Way we may know.</hi>] Pray Sir,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44996:33"/>
do <hi>You</hi> take my <hi>sence,</hi> or say what I do? Is <hi>shall know</hi> and <hi>may know</hi> all one? I say that they who take the Way left by God <hi>shall,</hi> that is, <hi>cannot chuse but know</hi>; as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuse but draw a <hi>straight Line,</hi> who draws it by a <hi>straight Rule;</hi> and he <hi>cannot chuse</hi> but come to <hi>London</hi> who goes on the <hi>Right Way</hi> thither: If either could miss, provided they <hi>draw</hi> by the <hi>Rule,</hi> and travel on in the <hi>Road</hi>; the <hi>Rule</hi> of the One is not <hi>straight,</hi> nor the <hi>Way</hi> of the other <hi>Right.</hi> And, so, I make account that the <hi>Way</hi> to know the Faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> is not a <hi>Right Way,</hi> if those who <hi>take</hi> it <hi>can fail</hi> to know their Faith; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not the <hi>Way</hi> left by <hi>God.</hi> You barely say, <hi>we may know</hi> with which it consists <hi>we may not know</hi>; and, so, you make us a Way in which they who travel may be always <hi>out of the Way</hi>; which is well enough for a Way of your making; but it is certainly no Way of <hi>God's</hi> making; for it is plainly <hi>no Way.</hi> But leaving this little tryal of your skill; that which you say to my Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (unfalsifyed) if you say any thing is, that 'tis, indeed a little <hi>too visibly,</hi> but yet <hi>true,</hi> and so we may go on.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. You Preface to the Third Proposition with ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>who I dispute against</hi>? and <hi>why if I would be thought to dispute against you,</hi> I do not use such and such <hi>Terms?</hi> Two very pleasant Questions! Your own and my Title Page tell as many as see them that I am disputing against <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi>'s; and yet you stand enquiring after the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret again, to ask why I do not use <hi>Terms</hi> to your mind, is to ask why the Defendant does not go to the Plaintiff to draw his Answer. You shall excuse me from being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to you, if you please; till you have a better knack at making Arguments, for <hi>your self,</hi> you shall make none for <hi>me,</hi> by my consent. But, where lyes the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel? You do not sure expect I should write to your liking; and if you think I speak not against you, and your party,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44996:33"/>
you need not trouble your self with what I say. What does not <hi>touch</hi> you, cannot <hi>hurt</hi> you; so you may say <hi>concedo totum,</hi> and rest secure by being unconcern'd. Yet you speak at last, and not till then, to purpose; when you bear the Reader in hand <hi>I pack the Cards,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 13.</note> and you will <hi>play fair</hi>; 'tis <hi>that</hi> must carry the Cause, or nothing. To get the Readers Affection on his side much imports <hi>him,</hi> who has nothing but such little Rhetorical tricks to trust to.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But, as if I had not the gift of Prophesy to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see with what a kind of Man I should have to do, I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to <hi>propose</hi> first what I intended to <hi>prove,</hi> before I went about to <hi>prove</hi> it, which I thought was the clearest way. You at a venture take what comes first, and tho' you saw it was my Conclusion which I inferr'd from the following Proposition, will needs speak to <hi>it</hi> before you speak to the Premises. This has so blunder'd all things, that the Reader will not easily perceive what we are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I shall thefore, (as you should have done) mind only the <hi>Proof</hi> here, and reserve the <hi>Inference</hi> till we come to the place where I made it. I put then to be prov'd that [<hi>Scripture's Letter interpretable by private Iudgements is not that Way</hi>] viz. <hi>the Way left by</hi> God; and for my proof that [<hi>we experience</hi> Presbyterians <hi>and</hi> Socinians, <hi>for example, both take that Way</hi> [of private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation] viz. <hi>and yet differ in such high Fundamentals as the</hi> Trinity <hi>and</hi> Godhead <hi>of Christ.</hi>]</p>
                  <p n="20">20. You, before you answer, would have it thought you might <hi>ridicule</hi> me in <hi>my own Language.</hi> Never spare me, good Sir, nor balk your mirth for me if I give a just Occasion: But where lies the Jest? Why, I quarrell'd with <hi>Dr. St.</hi> for bringing an instance, and now bring one my self: If this be all, I shall be tempted to be merry in my turn.<note place="margin">My First Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, p. 10.</note> I told <hi>Dr. St. he might undoubtedly have produc't his Instance if he had been arguing,</hi> but minded him that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44996:34"/>
his turn was then to <hi>Answer,</hi> and that his <hi>Instance</hi> was not an <hi>Answer,</hi> but a <hi>new Argument.</hi> And yet this is not plain enough for you to see that I faulted not the <hi>Instance,</hi> but the unseasonable <hi>Argument,</hi> as I should any other in such circumstances; and you would have it <hi>ridiculous</hi> in me who <hi>am arguing</hi> to do what I only excepted against, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he <hi>was not arguing</hi>; and freely acknowledg'd he might do, if he had been to argue. Sure you were in a pleasant humour, when you thought of turning me into <hi>ridicule,</hi> because your self understood not where the stress lay, tho' it were never so plainly told you. But to <hi>let this pass,</hi> as you say, with your causelesly gleeking Reflections upon Scripture and Tradition, what say you to the Proof I bring?</p>
                  <p n="21">
                     <note place="margin">P. 15.</note>21. Why, <hi>the force</hi> of my <hi>Argument</hi> (say you) is this: <hi>If any men can be found who wrest or misinterpret Scripture, then can it not be the Way to know what Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles taught.</hi> One thing after another, if it please you. Talk of <hi>the force of my Argument</hi> as much as you will, but, e're you leave the Proposition before you, of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> 'tis but fair to <hi>grant</hi> or <hi>deny</hi> it. I must intreat you too to leave <hi>translating</hi> my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They are <hi>New</hi> yet, and need <hi>no mending</hi>; when they do, I will be better satisfied of your Skill in the Trade, before I become your Customer. By your next words, rallying against the <hi>Validity of the Consequence,</hi> I guess you grant the <hi>Antecedent</hi>; and so, that care being over, we have nothing but the Consequence to mind. The Dispute would fall in more properly under the next Proposition which infers the Consequent; but now I am here, I will hear what you say, before I pass farther. You say then, That <hi>indeed this Argument proves nothing, but that I have no good opinion of the Scripture.</hi> Will this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous Cant never be left? I think the Scripture too
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44996:34"/>
good and too sacred to be abus'd by <hi>wrong</hi> Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and labour to preserve it from them: You labour to keep it expos'd to that Abuse; Pray, which of us two have a better Opinion and more Reverence for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? You proceed: <hi>Must a Rule be no good Rule, because some who use it misunderstand it and abuse it?</hi> What may you mean by this? I take my Ruler, and draw a Line by it; Does the Straightness or Crookedness of this Line depend upon my <hi>Vnderstanding?</hi> What is't then you call <hi>Misunderstanding</hi> a Rule? If you make the Letter of Scripture the Rule, and so private Interpreting the <hi>Vsing</hi> it, or drawing the Line, and the <hi>Sense</hi> the Line drawn; unriddle to us, if you can, how the <hi>Sense</hi> drawn from the <hi>Letter</hi> can any more fail to be <hi>True,</hi> than the <hi>Line</hi> drawn by the <hi>Rule</hi> to be <hi>straight</hi>; and which way that Sense can be <hi>misunderstood</hi>; and how the Rule can be a good Rule if it be us'd, and the Sense to which it is a Rule <hi>be</hi> misunderstood? Or, do you mean perhaps that 'tis with the Scripture as with a Grammar-Rule; where he who understands not what 'tis for a Nominative Case and a Verb to agree, may make false Construction, and yet the Rule be a good Rule. Tho' you should go thither for your Notion of a Rule, we should be but where we were. For, as the <hi>Grammar-Rule,</hi> let it be never so ill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, will make <hi>good Construction</hi> in case it be <hi>us'd</hi>; so the <hi>Scripture-Rule,</hi> if it be, as you put it, <hi>us'd,</hi> must needs produce <hi>right sense.</hi> But the truth is, a Grammar-Rule is not a Rule till it be <hi>understood</hi>; for he who understands not what 'tis for Cases and Verbs to agree, has <hi>no Rule</hi> to make them agree: And, then, if you will make the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture such a Rule, you will make the Letter first understood to be the Rule of understanding it, and people misunderstand what they understand, and the misunderstood Rule be a Rule, which is only a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44996:35"/>
Rule by being understood. In short, turn it which way you will, you will (to borrow an Expression) <hi>be much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to the Reader to make</hi> Sense <hi>of what you say.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. You question on; <hi>Must a Way be a wrong Way, because some that take it will not keep it?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 15.</note> Riddle my Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle again. Pray, who <hi>are</hi> or <hi>can be</hi> those <hi>some</hi> who <hi>take</hi> it and will not <hi>keep</hi> it? As long as they <hi>take</hi> it, they <hi>keep</hi> it, I think; and they keep it not against their Wills sure. He who has no Will to keep it, may when he pleases <hi>go out</hi> of it, but then he does no longer take it, and is none of the <hi>some</hi> of whom the Question speaks, (for they <hi>all</hi> take it) and so we have nothing to do with him. When all is done, the <hi>Will</hi> here is to no more purpose than the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding</hi> before: For he who <hi>takes</hi> the Way, shall certainly arrive at his Journeys end, let him <hi>Will</hi> what he pleases, and the Way must needs be a wrong way if he do not. 'Tis great pity you are not in the right; You would save more men than the <hi>Benefit of their Clergy:</hi> For the Thief in a Cart, upon the Way to <hi>Tyburn,</hi> would never come there if <hi>willing</hi> not to keep that Way would keep him from it. But by affirming that some <hi>take</hi> the Way who yet will not <hi>keep</hi> it, you affirm that some <hi>do</hi> and <hi>do not Take</hi> it. And so Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is well holp up with a Reflecter, who imagins we are talking of one, who only <hi>takes</hi> the Way at first, and afterwards <hi>leaves</hi> it; whereas 'tis plain, the Argument proceeds of such as make the Way their Choice, and persist to follow no other to their lifes End.</p>
                  <p n="23">
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>23. Lastly, You tell us, that <hi>Till it be prov'd God has left such a Way or Rule, as no man can possibly err out of it, mistake it, or abuse it,</hi> &amp;c. For you must permit me to stop by the way, I am too short breath'd to run over the long period at a loose. But, let you alone to make all sure: You are safe enough if all must go on your side,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44996:35"/>
till some body prove to you that no man <hi>can</hi> err out of the Way left by God, mistake or abuse it; that is, till some body prove that <hi>Ways</hi> are <hi>Prisons</hi> out of which there is no escaping; or that the man cannot possibly fall into <hi>Errour</hi> who is out of the Way to <hi>Truth.</hi> As many as leave the Catholick Church, leave the Way left by God; and you, like a right pleasant man, would have it prov'd, that the thing cannot possibly be done which we see is done by millions; and would have us, who say, they all <hi>do err</hi> and <hi>mistake,</hi> prove they <hi>cannot.</hi> All this while I a little suspect you <hi>mean</hi> otherwise than you <hi>say</hi>; and that by your words, <hi>Errour,</hi> and <hi>Mistake,</hi> and <hi>Abuse</hi> of the Way, you understand missing the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Way, Truth.</hi> But let us see what you will make of it: What would you have <hi>prov'd</hi> next? Why <hi>That it is not enough that God has left us such a Way or Rule, as men may understand and observe if they be not wanting to themselves.</hi> What do you call <hi>being wanting to themselves?</hi> I understand how a man that <hi>will not</hi> travel, or <hi>leaves</hi> a <hi>right</hi> and <hi>takes</hi> a <hi>wrong way,</hi> is <hi>wanting to himself:</hi> but he who puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the Way, continues on in it, and changes not his Road, is not wanting to himself in any thing I can imagin, which belongs to the <hi>Way</hi>: And the way of this Traveller I maintain against you, has not enough to be a <hi>Way,</hi> if it barely <hi>may,</hi> and yet <hi>may not,</hi> bring him to his Journeys End. What will this come to at last? Why, till these things be prov'd, <hi>It will not follow, that the Scripture's Letter, in the sense you have own'd it, is not the Way, tho' not only</hi> Presbyterians <hi>and</hi> Socinians, <hi>but the greater number of Mankind should own it, and yet differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Fundamental Points contain'd in it.</hi> What you call the <hi>Sense</hi> which you own of the Letter of Scripture, will come by and by. But will not that <hi>follow</hi> which you say here <hi>will not?</hi> Will it not follow, that the <hi>Way</hi> by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44996:36"/>
which a man that goes in it comes to <hi>Errour,</hi> is not the Way to <hi>Truth?</hi> Will it not follow, that he who at his Journeys End finds himself at <hi>York,</hi> did not go the Way to <hi>London?</hi> Pray, what's the Way to a Place? Is it not that Passage that he who has past it, finds himself at that Place? And so the Way to know the Doctrin of Christ and his Apostles, is it not the Means which he who has us'd knows that Doctrin? Why then, since <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> both interpret by their private Judgments, and one side <hi>knows not</hi> the Doctrin of Christ, it follows as unavoidably, that the <hi>Way</hi> of private Interpretation is no sure way to know it, as that he who has gone through the <hi>Strand,</hi> and finds himself at <hi>Charing Cross,</hi> has not gone the way to <hi>Moorfields</hi>; That is, as certainly as that <hi>a Way is a Way</hi> or Means to bring a man to such a Place.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. What do you talk then of <hi>erring</hi> for, and <hi>mistaking</hi> and <hi>abusing</hi> the <hi>Way?</hi> Or what do you mean? 'Tis true, those erring men do mistake the <hi>true</hi> Way, and for that reason <hi>err.</hi> But they mistake not the Way which you say is the <hi>true</hi> Way. They do interpret by their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Judgment, and so <hi>take,</hi> not <hi>mistake</hi> it; <hi>use,</hi> not <hi>abuse</hi> it. Sure you mean that they mistake the Doctrin of Christ; and, so, by mistaking the <hi>Way,</hi> you very <hi>wisely</hi> understand mistaking the <hi>End.</hi> And then, what a man are you to contend their way is a <hi>Way,</hi> and a <hi>sure Way</hi> too, to bring them to the Knowledge of Christ's Doctrin, when they pursue it and are not brought to that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? And what Eyes have you who perceive not that therefore it cannot be a <hi>sure</hi> way? Again, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose do you tell us that men <hi>may</hi> understand and <hi>observe</hi> (as if <hi>Observing</hi> concern'd our Question of <hi>Knowing</hi>) if they be <hi>not wanting to themselves</hi>? when they who take a <hi>right</hi> Way, not only <hi>may,</hi> but <hi>must,</hi> and cannot possibly fail of coming whither it leads, any more than the man
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44996:36"/>
who goes down the <hi>Strand,</hi> of coming to <hi>Charing-Cross</hi>; and when men have no more to do with a Way, but to travel <hi>in it</hi>; and so cannot be <hi>wanting to themselves,</hi> in that respect if they <hi>do.</hi> Of the same batch is your <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understanding</hi> and <hi>not keeping</hi> the Way. As if they who interpret by their private Judgments did <hi>not keep</hi> the way of interpreting by private Judgments. And tho' their Understandings be none of the best when they take that for the <hi>sure Way</hi> to understand by, yet that very misunderstanding is their understanding it to be the <hi>Way</hi>; and so they, even in your opinion, misunderstand not the <hi>Way,</hi> however they misunderstand <hi>by it.</hi> In fine, you amuse us with a company of <hi>VVords,</hi> which have a <hi>Sound</hi>; but either no <hi>sense</hi> at all, or none to purpose: And it remains, that, because a <hi>Way</hi> must bring every one that <hi>takes</hi> it to the <hi>End</hi> of that Way; and private Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not bring <hi>Socinians</hi> to the <hi>sure Knowledge of Christs Doctrine,</hi> which is the <hi>End;</hi> that, therefore Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Interpretation of Scripture <hi>is not a</hi> way to know that Doctrine <hi>surely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. And yet you can bear us in hand that this follows <hi>no more</hi> than it follows that because we <hi>see men misinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret and break good Laws daily,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 16.</note> 
                     <hi>therefore those Laws are Vnintelligible, or cannot be kept, and must be thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to shew them what the Law-giver expects from them.</hi> What <hi>breaking</hi> and <hi>keeping</hi> the Laws is brought in for, you best know that bring them in. Our Discourse is only about <hi>knowing</hi> the Doctrin of Faith, and not at all about <hi>Living</hi> up to it; and so has nothing to do with those who <hi>know,</hi> but will <hi>not keep</hi> the Laws, as is the case of most Malefactors. But you end your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course well I must needs say, and very sutably to all the rest, with an Instance directly against your self. You see that Laws left to <hi>Private Interpretation</hi> are, by all
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44996:37"/>
Mankind, judg'd <hi>insufficient,</hi> and <hi>publick</hi> Interpreters therefore set up every where; and, from the Parity with them which <hi>are</hi> Insufficient, you conclude the Letter of Scripture <hi>is not</hi> Insufficient. Any body but your self would have made another Use of this Instance. As <hi>God</hi> can write much plainer than Men, when he thinks fit, and has more care of their Salvation than they of their Temporal Concerns; another man would have conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that <hi>God</hi> did not intend their Salvation should depend on the privately-interpretable Letter of the Divine Law, which he left less plain than Men made the Letter of Humane Laws. But you, it seems, had a mind to make your Discourse all of a piece. The best is, 'tis now end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp; we are free to pass on to the fourth Proposition. To which, because the force of Exceptions against an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence before it be inferr'd appears not so well, I reserve what you say against it, while I put it only to be prov'd.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. It is this, <hi>Therefore Scriptures Letter interpretable by private Iudgments is not the way left by</hi> God <hi>to know sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what</hi> Christ <hi>and his</hi> Apostles <hi>taught, or surely to arrive at right Faith.</hi> And now I must look to my self, for you pour out here your distinguishing Talent upon me.

                     <hi>then I confess Scriptures Letter cannot be the Rule or Way.</hi> There is one branch of your Distinction; and so the other, unless you will talk non-sense, must needs be, <hi>Scripture</hi>'s <hi>Letter,</hi> meaning <hi>sensed</hi> Characters, <hi>can be</hi> or <hi>is</hi> the Rule. Your words are, <hi>Yet if he can think it reasonable to allow as much to the</hi> Scripture <hi>as he expects we should allow to this Letter of his, that it contains good sence exprest in words significant and intelligible; we deny his Assumption that Scripture</hi>'s <hi>Letter is not this way.</hi> As you have this Art, among the rest, to talk unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44996:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when you have a mind to't, in very plain English, I wish some Body would tell me for you, whether you take <hi>scripture</hi>'s <hi>Letter</hi> in this period for <hi>unsensed</hi> or <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> Characters; for truly I cannot tell my self. By the terms you put [<hi>intelligible</hi>] and [<hi>significant</hi>] one would guess you mean <hi>unsensed Characters</hi>; for [<hi>intelligible</hi>] im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports what <hi>may</hi> be understood, but <hi>is not yet;</hi> and [<hi>signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi>] what <hi>may be</hi> perceived by the sign, whether it <hi>be</hi> or <hi>no.</hi> And then you have made a fair hand of it with your <hi>fair dealing,</hi> who distinguish the word [<hi>Letter</hi>] in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Characters unsensed and Characters <hi>unsensed</hi>; and grant it to be a Rule in <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>two same</hi> meanings, and deny it in the <hi>other.</hi> But you shall talk sense for me, and mean Characters <hi>sensed</hi>; and then lets see how much you have mended the matter. A Character <hi>sensed</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies a Character with the <hi>sense</hi> joined to it: The <hi>sense</hi> of the Characters of <hi>Scripture</hi> is the sense of <hi>God,</hi> and the sense of <hi>God</hi> is that which we are to <hi>believe.</hi> And, so, Scripture-Characters <hi>sensed</hi>; signify <hi>Faith</hi> it self in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with those Characters. Now <hi>Faith</hi> is the <hi>End</hi> to which we are looking for a <hi>Way</hi> to carry us. To tell us then that <hi>scripture</hi>'s <hi>Letters</hi> taken for <hi>sensed</hi> Characters is this <hi>way,</hi> is to tell us that the <hi>end</hi> is the <hi>way to it self</hi>; that the means to <hi>get</hi> Faith is to <hi>have</hi> it first; that, when we know it, we know it; that, when we are at our Journeys <hi>End,</hi> we are in the direct <hi>Road to it,</hi> and such fine things, which would tempt a man not very fond of disputing, to leave it off and betake himself to some other business: For how can you or any think fit to vex poor contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy all your life, when your very sense proves Non-sense? And yet it is not that you have not serv'd a Prenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship long enough in the Mystery: But the best Shoema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in the world cannot make a good shoe of Bad Leather.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. Yet, as you are not a man to be discourag'd with
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44996:38"/>
ill success, you are at your Distinctions again; and tell us that, <hi>if by these words,</hi> interpretable by private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>I mean the</hi> Scripture <hi>any way interpretable, as any private man may possibly wrest the words to make them comply with his own sentiments, or through</hi> Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>and Laziness, and</hi> Neglect of <hi>such Helps and</hi> Means <hi>as are fit to be us'd, may</hi> misunderstand <hi>them, I must</hi> have a very bad <hi>Conscience,</hi> &amp;c. As if the Question were about my Conscience. But you would say, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that Scripture, so meant, is not the Way, and I say it is not <hi>too.</hi> Pray, what Conscience is yours, if mine be bad when I say as you do?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 14.</note> 
                     <hi>But if</hi> my <hi>meaning be, that</hi> Scripture <hi>as it may be understood by a Private Man of a competent Iudgment, using such Helps as are proper, is not the Way,</hi> you <hi>again deny</hi> my <hi>Assumption.</hi> Because it would render the Discourse unintelligibly confus'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat so many lines at every turn, I shall, with your good leave; say in short, <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad</hi> Judgments; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by the <hi>Bad</hi> all the qualifications of the First Branch, and all of your second by the <hi>Good.</hi> I take you then to say that <hi>Scripture</hi>'s <hi>Letter,</hi> as interpretable by <hi>Bad</hi> Judgments <hi>is not</hi> the Way; but, as Interpretable by <hi>Good</hi> Judgments is the Way. By this account three parts in four of Mankind at a modest computation, have <hi>no VVay.</hi> For so many <hi>Bad</hi> Judgments there are at least. But, the main Point is, while we are enquiring which the <hi>Way</hi> is which <hi>God has left,</hi> pray what have we to do with the <hi>Iudgments of</hi> men? Can they <hi>make</hi> or <hi>unmake</hi> it? Or does it depend on them to be or not be the Way he left, as they happen to be different? It is a <hi>VVay</hi> only so long as good Judgments travel in it, and ceases to be a <hi>VVay</hi> assoon as Bad Judgments come upon it. A Way, I think, is a <hi>VVay</hi> whether it be beaten by the Lusty or the Lame, the Pur-blind or the Well-sighted. And, so if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44996:38"/>
the Letter of Scripture, interpretable by Private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>be</hi> the Way which God has left us, 'tis not the Goodness or Badness of Private Judgments which can make it <hi>not</hi> the Way. Wherefore, tho' you have chopt upon a Distinction for which we are beholden to you, for we might chance else not to have minded there are Good and Bad Judgments in the World; Yet your Distinction unluckily has no relation at all to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. Nevertheless, it serves for <hi>Talk</hi> and <hi>Show,</hi> and bids fair to draw us from thinking what 'tis we are about, to wrangling about how much Brains go to a <hi>Competent Iudgment,</hi> how much <hi>Pains</hi> to <hi>Diligence,</hi> and such very useful Disputes: which, if you had any, was in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood your Design. For sure you cannot but see your self, that your Distinction is no more to our purpose than News from <hi>Hungary</hi> or the <hi>Morea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="28">28. Again, your First Branch says that <hi>Bad</hi> Judgments <hi>may</hi> misunderstand the Letter of Scripture, and that it is not the Way to such; which I think is to say, that it is not the Way for that reason; for you do not, and <hi>I</hi> suppose, will not say that they may not understand it right, if luck serve, let them be never so <hi>Bad</hi>; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they <hi>may</hi> misunderstand it, therefore it is not the Way. Why then the very reason you give why it is not the Way in your First branch, bars you from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it a Way in your Second. For all you say of your <hi>competent</hi> and <hi>assisted</hi> Judgment, is, that they <hi>may</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it <hi>right</hi>; which is not denying, if it be not owning, they <hi>may</hi> likewise understand it <hi>wrong.</hi> And then, you may unriddle to us when you can, how the <hi>Bad</hi> Judgment, which <hi>may</hi> misunderstand it, makes it <hi>no Way,</hi> and the <hi>Good</hi> makes it a Way, which <hi>may</hi> misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it <hi>too.</hi> You are strangely partial to <hi>Good Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> to make the Possibility to misunderstand Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44996:39"/>
Letter exclude the Bad and admit the Good; and the Possibility to understand it right, include the Good and shut out the Bad. Thus men <hi>have,</hi> or <hi>have not</hi> a Way as they find favour with you, and as you like their Judgments. As far as I see, your Favour is all in all. For, since you make the Letter of Scripture a Way to Good, but not to Bad Judgments, there is no knowing when it <hi>is</hi> and when it <hi>is not</hi> the Way, till we know which must pass for Good, and which for Bad Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and so nothing can come of it till we have a Test to try them. Now, I am much afraid that <hi>your own</hi> Judgment is, like <hi>Bayes</hi> his Play, your <hi>only Test;</hi> and that you make account all goes right as long as People think as you do. Marry, if they chance to deviate from you, they lose their <hi>Iudgments,</hi> or their <hi>Diligence,</hi> or their <hi>Proper Helps,</hi> or something, and stop up their way with their own Faults. There is no doing here without Scales again to weigh out the Brains which go to a <hi>Competent Iudgment,</hi> the <hi>Pains</hi> which go to <hi>Diligence,</hi> and the rest. Otherwise, we have lost Scripture; and, for our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, get <hi>your Word</hi> instead of it. For, if Scripture inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretable by a Competent Judgment be our Way, and yours be a Competent Judgment (which no doubt you suppose as your First Principle) 'tis a plain Case that <hi>Your Iudgment</hi> is our Way; which in truth is the Sum of all. So long as we will believe as you would have us, we shall have the most magnificent words in the world, for our Souls. We shall all have <hi>Competent Iudgments</hi> from <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Proper Helps</hi> from <hi>Grace.</hi> We shall (as many as will stand upon't) have <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> nay infinitely greater Certainty than Reason can afford, <hi>the Word of God.</hi> But, all is to be understood with the condition annext of trusting You for all. Otherwise we have neither <hi>Diligence,</hi> nor <hi>Iudgment,</hi> nor <hi>Helps,</hi> nor
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44996:39"/>
                     <hi>Certainty,</hi> nor <hi>Word of God,</hi> nor any thing in the world but <hi>Your</hi> Word; who yet cannot for your life make any three words you say hang handsomely together.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. But I have stray'd after your Will-of-the-Wisp till I have almost lost sight of our Point. The Question is, <hi>Whether Scripture's Letter Interpretable by private Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> be <hi>the Way left by God.</hi> I maintain it is not; and prove it, because men who take that way <hi>err.</hi> For, I thought it needed no proving, that <hi>the Way left by God</hi> is not <hi>the Way to Errour.</hi> You distinguish twice; First the <hi>Letter</hi> into <hi>Sensed</hi> and <hi>Vns<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nsed</hi> Characters; that is, if you make there any Distinction at all. Now the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is of the Letter <hi>Interpretable,</hi> that is, <hi>not yet In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted,</hi> or which has not yet the Sense put to it, and so is yet <hi>unsensed.</hi> When you then distinguish the <hi>Letter Interpretable,</hi> into <hi>Sensed</hi> and <hi>Vnsensed,</hi> you make a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, whereof one branch is not comprehended in the Notion to be divided. 'Tis just the same as to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish <hi>Learned Men</hi> into <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Vnlearned;</hi> or <hi>Men</hi> into <hi>Negroes</hi> and <hi>Horses.</hi> Your Second Distinction is, of <hi>Iudgments,</hi> into <hi>Competent</hi> and <hi>Incompetent,</hi> which is Twin to the former. I vouch't for Proof the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and <hi>Socinians;</hi> men of very <hi>Competent</hi> Judgments; and who are neither <hi>ignorant,</hi> nor <hi>lazy,</hi> nor <hi>negligent,</hi> nor baulk any <hi>means</hi> or <hi>helps,</hi> which they judge can enable them to understand the Letter, or that you have, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that, for a <hi>Spiritual Guide</hi> (which, I suppose, is one of the <hi>Helps</hi>) they in likelihood use the Assistance of some body of their own, not of Your Perswasion. But if one of your Protestant Guides be a <hi>proper</hi> help to your Protestant, a <hi>Socinian</hi> sure is proper to a <hi>Socinian.</hi> In short, they fall under none of your ill Qualifications, and when I speak of <hi>Competent</hi> and <hi>Qualify'd</hi> Judgments, you distinguish the <hi>Competent</hi> into some which <hi>are</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44996:40"/>
and some which <hi>are not</hi> Competent; and, again, the <hi>Qualify'd,</hi> into those which <hi>are,</hi> and those which <hi>are not Qualify'd.</hi> The sum is this, I ask whether the <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensed</hi> Letter be the <hi>Way;</hi> and you answer, the <hi>Sensed</hi> Letter is; that is, the <hi>End</hi> is part of the <hi>way</hi> to the End. I propose you <hi>Competent Iudgments,</hi> and ask if the Letter be a Way to <hi>Them,</hi> and you reply, it is not a way to the <hi>Incompetent.</hi> And so you, who, good squeamish Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, fall into a Scruple at the very name of <hi>Cards,</hi> can play at <hi>Cross-purposes</hi> all along very freely, even when Souls are at Stake. I desire you to remember that I speak of a Way, which they who <hi>take, shall,</hi> and that <hi>surely,</hi> arrive at Christ's Faith. You talk of a <hi>way</hi> by which men so and so qualify'd, <hi>may</hi> arrive at it. As if <hi>may be</hi> were any thing to <hi>shall</hi> and <hi>must be;</hi> or the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of Travellers any thing to the <hi>way.</hi> I <note n="*" place="margin">My First Letter, P. 31.</note> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told I should have nothing but an unconcerning Return for an Answer: And you have made me, tho' against my will, prophesie; not bating so much of my Prediction as the <hi>scornful Iest.</hi> For there is the <hi>Mountain</hi> and the <hi>Mouse,</hi> and <hi>Reading a Lecture in Logick</hi> to verifie it.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. You conclude with an Argument against my Conclusion: <hi>You,</hi> I say, who are <hi>Answering,</hi> and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with <hi>Arguing.</hi> But, what would we have? Men who are uneasie will alwaies be shifting places. All our earnest Sollicitations could not wring one Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of you when it was your turn to <hi>prove;</hi> and now 'tis your turn to <hi>Answer,</hi> you thrust your Arguments upon us unbidden. Nor is there any keeping you from falling into the same Fault with your <hi>Suppositions,</hi> that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> did with his <hi>Instance.</hi> You <hi>suppose</hi> then 1. <hi>That the Scripture is God's Word.</hi> And so do I too, provided you mean the true Sense of it. For a false Sense, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you think, is, in my Judgment, <hi>not God's Word.</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:44996:40"/>
2. <hi>That it was written to be understood.</hi> Undoubtedly; but not by every one, barely by means of the Letter. All Books are written to be understood: Grammar, for Children to understand Construction; Mathematical Books for those who will understand Mathematicks; and yet those Books without Masters will make but few Grammarians or Mathematicians. 3. <hi>That it is written for the Instruction of Private Men.</hi> Yes, but not for the only, or sufficient means of their Instruction, barely by the Letter. 4. <hi>That they are concern'd to understand it.</hi> Yes again; and as much concern'd not to <hi>misunderstand</hi> it. 5. <hi>That they may believe and live as it directs.</hi> They not onely <hi>may,</hi> but <hi>ought.</hi> But, pray remember, that <hi>It</hi> directs no <hi>believing</hi> or <hi>living</hi> according to a <hi>false sense.</hi> 6. <hi>That they have means left them of God for the Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of it, so far as it is of necessary concernment to them.</hi> Yes, and that <hi>Absolutely Certain Means,</hi> the publick Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Church or <hi>Tradition.</hi> 7. <hi>And that,</hi> using <hi>those Means as they ought they may understand it.</hi> Never mince it with <hi>may;</hi> they <hi>shall</hi> and certainly shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it who use those means. From all you conclude at last. <hi>And thus it is to them the way to know surely what</hi> Christ <hi>and his</hi> Apostles <hi>taught as necessary to their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> How! The way to those who use those Means! Why this is just as I say. But what becomes of those who use not those Means? 'Twas ill forgot when your Hand was in at <hi>supposing,</hi> not to <hi>suppose</hi> in amongst the rest, that <hi>Private Interpretation</hi> is the Means lest by <hi>God</hi> for understanding Scripture. For, if <hi>publick Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> be those Means, as it needs must, since I have prov'd that <hi>Private</hi> is not; the Scripture plainly is <hi>no Way</hi> to those who only rely on the <hi>Private</hi> Means to understand it. And your <hi>Protestants</hi> are much beholding to your Argument which shews that Scripture, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44996:41"/>
as <hi>they</hi> interpret it, by <hi>private Iudgment,</hi> is no Way to <hi>them.</hi> And I were very unreasonable if I should take offence at your Challenge, which bids me <hi>shew, when I can, that your suppositions are Vnreasonable or False.</hi> Not I, believe me; For I should be very cross-natur'd to fall out with a man who takes my part.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. Thus you have <hi>try'd</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">P. 12.</note>as you call it, to answer my Argument; and have succeeded (even in your own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I guess) very sorrily. For had you been Confident of your performance against it as it is, you would never have thought of <hi>changing</hi> it, as you do here <hi>p.</hi> 17. Men who have put by a Thrust are not sollicitous to instruct their Adversary how he <hi>should have</hi> Thrust. And yet you will needs be teaching me, how I should have done <hi>to have made sure work;</hi> that is, to have been sure to hit your Buckler. I mean not to lose time on your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It were ridiculous for me to amuse my self with what never <hi>was</hi> nor <hi>will</hi> be said by any but your self. No body else would have left out the principal Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>using the Rule,</hi> and, so, coming to Right Faith by <hi>using</hi> it. As if a <hi>Rule</hi> would make a <hi>Line</hi> of it self, tho' no body draw by it: And a <hi>Way</hi> bring to the Journeys <hi>End;</hi> even those who travel <hi>not</hi> in it. In a word, your Argument has all the faults of your Answer in short; and onely shews you can speak from the purpose more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly and methodically, by way of Syllogism.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. After you had thus nobly acquitted your self in answering my short Discourse, you proceed in the same Method to answer Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Argument for the Infallibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Catholick Church.

                  <p n="33">33. You doubt whether I think <hi>it needs any Proof that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is Infallible.</hi> To those who reflect

on the force of a vast Human Testimony, attesting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> and what Assent it claims from Human Nature in parallel occasions, I do indeed judge it does not so much need <hi>Proof</hi> as <hi>Reflection.</hi> But, why should I think it needs no Proof against <hi>You</hi>; who, we see plainly, have <hi>interpreted</hi> your selves out of your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sentiments?

By your constant jesting whenever Infallibility comes in the way, you discover your anger against it, because you know you can produce nothing that is truly <hi>Certain,</hi> to ground your Faith. Notwithstanding the vulgar use to say com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, [<hi>I am infallibly Certain of such a thing</hi>] yet none laughs at them or thinks them extravagant: And must we be afraid to use the same Language in our Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, because your <hi>Ears</hi> are so <hi>tender,</hi> or rather your <hi>Grounds</hi> so <hi>soft,</hi> they cannot bear it? If you will needs declare against <hi>Infallible Certainty,</hi> be but so candid as to say still you are <hi>Fallibly Certain,</hi> and see how your Readers will smile at your Folly: And yet you ought to own one or the other, if you be Certain at all; for there can be no <hi>Third</hi> or <hi>Middle</hi> sort of Certainty, which is neither <hi>Fallible</hi> or <hi>Infallible.</hi> Pray speak to this Point, and let's have a little Reason from you at least, and not perpetual Rambling and Shuffling.

[<hi>in things necessary to Salvation</hi>] and [<hi>using the Proper helps</hi>] which (as we shall see anon) will cost one's life to peruse; and this you tell us, <hi>encourages them to take pains to be well assur'd of the Truth.</hi> Fine words, I must confess, if they had any Sense! Is it such a rare Encouragement to take pains <hi>to be well assur'd</hi> their Faith is <hi>True,</hi> when you tell them, that after all their pains they can never be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, but it <hi>may be False</hi>; that is, they can never be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd that it <hi>is True?</hi> But, when all's done, and the Certainty of your Grounds fail you, your last refuge is, that <hi>the same Infallible God who has given the Means, has assur'd his Blessing to them that diligently use them.</hi> But this begs the Question: For, if the Rule you follow be not the Means ordain'd by God to arrive at Faith, you have neither the right <hi>Means,</hi> nor can you be assur'd of any <hi>Blessing</hi> by using them; unless you can prove God has promis'd his Assistance to those that use not the <hi>Means</hi> he appointed; or will certainly <hi>direct</hi> those to the <hi>right Place</hi> who take the <hi>wrong Way</hi> to it. Next, you fall into a <hi>Wonderment</hi> to <hi>hear me talk of mens being discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd —for want of an Infallible Guide.</hi> And I wonder you should <hi>hear me talk</hi> what I never <hi>spoke.</hi> Not one Syllable was there of a <hi>Guide:</hi> All my Discourse was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an Infallible <hi>Rule.</hi> But the Truth is, you are sick of any Discourse that sifts the Uncertainty of your <hi>Rule</hi>; and therefore car'd not what new pretence you started, nor whether it were a False or True one, so you could but get the Dispute transferr'd to another subject. Yet, upon this false pretence you run on with your Raillery to the end of the Section.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. But, <hi>at last you have found Infallibility in Tradition,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>after you have been sent from place to place to seek it.</hi> Pray, Sir, who sent you? We, with whom you are discoursing, never directed you to any other, but to that of <hi>Tradition</hi>:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44996:43"/>
and you know well, and every Reader sees, we are treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of no Infallibility, but only <hi>that.</hi> Yet you triumph mightily, you have <hi>found</hi> a thing which was proffer'd to you <hi>unsought:</hi> and found <hi>it at last,</hi> which was both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to you and urg'd upon you <hi>at first.</hi> What an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Trifler are you, to confess to your Reader you have been running after Butterflies all this while, and could not once turn your Eye to the Question which was just before you, nay prest upon you! Well, but what are my <note n="*" place="margin">My First Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, P. 7.</note> words? [<hi>The Certainty of Scripture is from Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>] Do you deny this? No, you positively assert it, <hi>First Letter, p.</hi> 7. Let's proceed. [<hi>Therefore there is no refusing to admit, that Tradition causes Certainty.</hi>] Do you deny this? How can you without destroying the Certainty of your own Rule [<hi>Scripture</hi>] which depends upon it, and withal contradicting your self? I added, [<hi>And makes Faith as Certain as Scripture.</hi>] Can you deny this? That is, will you affirm the same Virtue does not work the same Effect if the matter be capable? Let's see now how you answer. <hi>Yet it may be this Certainty comes not up to Infallibility.</hi> Yes, it does; for the Certainty here spoken of was <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> as was twice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on immediately before, from your own words, <hi>p.</hi> 6. and I <note n="*" place="margin">P. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>prov'd</hi> it was the same with <hi>Infallibility</hi> which you have never <hi>disprov'd</hi>; and so, unless you give a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Answer, your own Acknowledgment that Tradition causes <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> forces you to grant we are <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly Certain</hi> of our Faith. But say <note n="*" place="margin">P. 19.</note> you, <hi>The</hi> Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Scripture was <hi>more Vniversal:</hi> Suppose it so, was not Tradition for <hi>Doctrin</hi> large <hi>enough</hi> to cause <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Certainty!</hi> Or, are not ten millions of Attesters as able to cause Absolute Certainty as Twenty? Pray, consider a little the Vertue of <hi>Witnessing Authority,</hi> and the force it has upon Human Nature. When the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44996:43"/>
comes to that pitch, that it is seen to be impossible they should all be <hi>deceiv'd</hi> in the thing they unanimou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sly attest, or <hi>conspire</hi> to <hi>deceive</hi> us, their Testimony has its full Effect upon us, and begets in us that firm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable Assent we call <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi>; and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of myriads more adds nothing to the <hi>substance</hi> of that Assent, since it was wrought without it. But the main is, you quite misunderstand the nature of a long Successive Testimony. Let ten thousand men witness what <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three,</hi> who were the Original Attestors of a thing, said <hi>at first,</hi> and twenty thousand more witness in the <hi>next Age</hi> what those ten thousand told them, and so forwards, yet (taking them precisely as <hi>Witnesses</hi>) they amount to no more, in order to prove the <hi>Truth</hi> of that thing, than the Credit of those <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three First Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> goes. 'Tis the <hi>First Source</hi> of a Testimony, which gives the succeeding ones all their weight to prove the Thing that is witnest to be <hi>True:</hi> 'Tis that from which the <hi>Largeness</hi> and <hi>Firmness</hi> of a Testimony, brought to evince the <hi>Truth</hi> of any thing, is to be measured or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated. Since then the stream of Tradition for Doctrin had for its Source innumerable Multitudes of those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in the First Age, in many places of the World, who heard the Apostles preach it, and saw them settle the Practice of it in the respective Churches; but the Original Testifiers that such a <hi>Book</hi> was writ by such or such an Apostle or Evangelist, were <hi>very few</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, sometimes perhaps not past <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three:</hi> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with any shew of Sense be pretended, that the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for the several <hi>Books of Scripture</hi> is in any degree comparable in either regard to the Tradition for <hi>Doctrin.</hi> Your next Answer is, that <hi>This Vniversal Tradition is no more but Human Testimony,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>and that can be no ground for Infallibility which excludes all possibility of Errour.</hi> Pray
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44996:44"/>
why not! If things were so order'd (as indeed they are that the Testifiers <hi>could</hi> neither be <hi>deceiv'd</hi> in the Doctrin, being bred and brought up to it; nor <hi>conspire to deceive</hi> us, in telling the World in any Age that the new Doctrin they had invented was immediately delivered; then it was not possible any Errour could come in, under the notion of a Doctrin delivered from the beginning. But is not your Tradition for Scripture <hi>Human Testimony</hi> too? And if that can be erroneous, may not all Christian Faith by your Principles be perhaps a company of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stories? You must be forc'd by your own words here to confess it; but I dare say, your Parishioners, should you openly avow it, would hate you for the Blasphemy. You would tell them, I doubt not, as you do us, that <hi>Moral Certainty is enough to stand on such a Foundation:</hi> that is, such a Certainty as may <hi>deceive you,</hi> and, by a necessary consequence, may haste to overturn the whole Fabrick of Christian Faith. In the mean time let's see how manifestly you contradict Dr. <hi>St.</hi> when you should <hi>defend</hi> him. He avow'd <note n="*" place="margin">First Letter, P. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> for the Book of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and this upon the Foundation of <hi>Tradition;</hi> and you tell us here <hi>Tradition</hi> can ground but <hi>Moral Certainty:</hi> Now all the World, till you writ, counter distinguisht <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> which you jumble in one. But distinct they ever were, are, and shall be; for the Word [<hi>Moral</hi>] signifies a Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Imperfection of Certainty, and [<hi>Absolute</hi>] plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expresses the Perfection of it: whence 'tis Evident, that either you contradict Dr. <hi>St.</hi> (perhaps not without his private Order) or he himself. We shall have all words shortly lose their signification, for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but to give you room to shift this way and that, when you are too close prest with Reason.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Now, since Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had granted, that Tradition is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44996:44"/>
                     <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> for <hi>Scripture,</hi> and I had prov'd that <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> was the same with <hi>Infallibility,</hi> what should hinder me from inferring,<note place="margin">My First Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter P. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>that unless some special difficulty be found in other things that light into the same channel, it must bring them down infallibly too?</hi> Your Gifts of Interpretation expounds these Words of mine thus: <hi>These other things are things unwritten in that Holy Book.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 21.</note> I do assure you, Sir, you are mightily mistaken. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver told you yet that all Faith was not contain'd in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>explicitly</hi> or <hi>implicitly.</hi> What I meant was, that <hi>the whole Body of</hi> Christs <hi>Doctrin;</hi> (and not only that such a <hi>Book</hi> was <hi>Scripture,</hi>) nay the self-same Doctrin of <hi>Faith</hi> that is contain'd in <hi>Scripture,</hi> comes down by <hi>Tradition,</hi> or the Churche's Testimony. But with this Difference, (as to the <hi>Manner</hi> of it,) among others, that the <hi>Church</hi> that testifies it, having the sense of it in her Breast, can explain her meaning so as to put it out of all Question to Learners, Doubters and Enquirers; which the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> cannot. Whence we need not <hi>fish for our Faith in the channel of Tyber,</hi> as your great Wit tells us; St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Ship, (the Church) that caught so many Fishes at first, (the Body of Primitive Christians, who were the first deliverers of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Doctrin,) hath stor'd up pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision enough for the succession of Faith to the Worlds end. There we find it to our Hands. 'Tis your sober <hi>Enquirers</hi> who <hi>Fish</hi> for it among dead unsensed Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and in the Lake of <hi>Geneva;</hi> from whence to save the labour of going thither, you and your Friends are deriving a great <hi>Channel</hi> to run into <hi>Thames,</hi> over-swell it's Banks, and drown all the Churches. <hi>Lacus Lemanus</hi> is your <hi>Tyber, Geneva</hi> your <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Calvin</hi> (the Prime of your new <hi>Apostles</hi>) your St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="36">36. All this is but prelude: But, now comes Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Argument, and therefore we are to expect now, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44996:45"/>
you but <hi>trifled</hi> hitherto, more pertinent &amp; close Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. The first Proposition was this: <hi>All Traditionary</hi> Christians <hi>believe the same to day they did yesterday, &amp; so up to</hi> the time of <hi>our</hi> B. Saviour. This you seem to deny in regard they may perhaps <hi>be so call'd from their adhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Tradition which reaches not so high as our</hi> Saviours <hi>time, but only pretends to it,</hi> whither we only <hi>pretend</hi> to it or no will be seen hereafter, when the Fourth Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition comes to be examin'd. In the mean time pray jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not two Questions which are <hi>distinct,</hi> and ought to be kept so. The whole Business here is about the <hi>use</hi> or <hi>Sense</hi> of the word [<hi>Traditionary</hi>] &amp; how we both take it in our present Controversy. Now that we both agree in the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of [<hi>Tradition,</hi>] whence [<hi>Traditionary</hi>] is deriv'd, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by this, that we lay claim to such a Tradition as reaches to <hi>Christ,</hi> and go about to prove it; you deny our Claim, and endeavour to <hi>disprove</hi> it: But 'tis evident you <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>same</hi> thing to us which we <hi>lay Claim to;</hi> otherwise we should not talk of the same Thing, and so should not understand one another, nor could discourse together; wherefore 'tis manifest we both agree in the Notion or <hi>Meaning</hi> of that <hi>Word,</hi> however we disagree in the <hi>Application</hi> of it to the <hi>Persons.</hi> Nor do we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in the least, what you would put upon us here, to inferr <hi>hence</hi> that this body of Christians that now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to it, <hi>did always</hi> so; but only contend, that if they did not <hi>ever</hi> adhere to it, they must have deserted it and taken up another Rule, and so, cease to be true Claimers of a Tradition from <hi>Christ,</hi> or <hi>Traditionary Christians.</hi> Moreover, we judge we have <hi>right</hi> to lay Claim to it, till we be driven out of it by a former and better Title; since we were in possession of this Rule at the time of the Reformation, or held all our Faith upon that tenure.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. The second Proposition is this: <hi>If they follow this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44996:45"/>
Rule they can never err in Faith.</hi> Whence follows the Third; [<hi>And therefore they are Infallible.</hi>] Your Answer Sir, to this. Can they adhere still to what was deliver'd, and yet <hi>err</hi> in <hi>Faith,</hi> if what was still deliver'd, was <hi>Christ's</hi> Doctrin. Your Answer is;<note place="margin">P. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>His Friend tells us this is palpably self-evident.</hi> And does not his <hi>Adversary</hi> confess it too? Do not your self acknowledge it in your 21<hi>st,</hi> and 22<hi>d.</hi> Pages, and say you <hi>must lay by your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, turn</hi> Romanist, <hi>and renounce your Private Iudgment,</hi> if you did not grant it. And can the Reader, so well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your shuffles, judge it less than <hi>palpably self-evident,</hi> which your humour, so restiff to grant any thing, tho' never so clearly prov'd, is forc't to yield to. Lastly, does his Friend only <hi>tell</hi> you 'tis self-evident? Does not he prove it to be as Evident as 'tis that <hi>the same is the same with it self</hi>? And is not such a thing Evident by its own light, or out of the very Terms, that is, <hi>self-evident?</hi> Pray, Sir, when I <hi>prove</hi> any thing, let the Reader know I did so; and do not thus constantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend still that I only <hi>said</hi> so, or <hi>told</hi> you so. A pretty Stratagem to avoid speaking to my <hi>Proofs;</hi> but how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest let the Reader judge.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. But, say you, <hi>unless this Tradition be longer than it is yet prov'd to be, they may follow it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>and err all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in following it.</hi> No doubt of it; if it fall short of reaching up to <hi>Christs,</hi> we may follow it, and Err by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it, as all <hi>Hereticks</hi> do in following their novel Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. That (<hi>yet</hi>) is a very pretty Word; for it puts the Reader into a conceit that we have produc't nothing from the beginning of the World, to the very time of your Writing, to prove our Tradition reaches to our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours dayes;</hi> and yet, if we challenge you that we <hi>have</hi> prov'd it in the very next words of our Argument, you can make your escape, by saying, that you are not <hi>yet</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:44996:46"/>
come to speak to that point, and that you meant no more. Who would think there should be such Vertue in a petty Monosyllable, as at once to disgrace <hi>us,</hi> and save <hi>you</hi> harmless! The second Answer to this Point is, <hi>Let it</hi> (the Tradition spoken of) <hi>be never so long, yet if they follow it not, they may err.</hi> Very good! The Arguers Words are, <hi>If they follow this Rule they cannot err in Faith;</hi> which implies, that, if they <hi>do not,</hi> they <hi>may err:</hi> and you say the self-same over again, with an ayr of Opposition, and there's an Answer for us now. As if to <hi>conform</hi> to your Adversaries Words were to <hi>confute</hi> him, any thing will serve, rather than say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. The fourth Proposition brought to prove that this Tradition we lay Claim to, does indeed reach to <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> is this, <hi>They could not innovate in Faith, unless they did forget what they held the day before, or out of malice alter it.</hi> And here lies the main Stress of the Controversy between us; for you have granted here, Page 21.22. that were this Rule follow'd, they must still enjoy the same Faith <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles</hi> taught; and this Discourse is brought to shew they <hi>did</hi> follow it. We are to expect then that your choicest Engines must be set on work to baffle a Proof, which, if it holds; brings such dangerous consequences after it, and indeed concludes the whole Controversy. Your first Attempt is in plain terms most Evident, &amp; a most Unconscionable Falsification. After you had (P. 21.) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited this fourth Proposition, you immediately add. <hi>Our Author undertakes to make this out more clearly, &amp; therefore we will hear what he saith for our better Information.</hi> P. 18. <hi>He asks, did Christ teach any Errours?</hi> and so you go on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing that whole Argument, which proves, that if the first Fathers believ'd what Christ taught, and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44996:46"/>
Sons all along believ'd what their Fathers did, the last-born Son in the World believ'd the same that Christ taught. Pray, Sir, play fair above-board. You have directly falsify'd that <hi>whole</hi> Discourse, by pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here that the words you cite were to make out that <hi>Fourth Proposition clearly,</hi> (viz. <hi>That we could not innovate in Faith</hi> &amp;c.) whereas the truth of that Fourth Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was <hi>made out</hi> by me nine pages before (viz. p. 9.) and the Discourse you mention here, as intended to make it out, is found p. 18, 19. and levell'd at a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent business: <hi>viz.</hi> that a Church could not <hi>adhere to Tradition,</hi> and at the same time <hi>erre,</hi> as you pretended we must grant of the Greek Church. Clear your Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit when you can, I charge it upon you as a voluntary Insincerity: but you shall never clear it unless by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out your Reader's eyes, or perswading him not to use them. So that it seems let us bring what Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we will, you need do no more when they are too hard to answer, but apply them to a <hi>wrong Point</hi> they were never mean't to prove, and then 'tis easy to shew manifestly they are frivolous and good for nothing. In the mean time, who sees not that your Cause as well as your Credit is run a ground and like to split, when you are put to such shifts! I wonder how this gross Fault could escape Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s acute sight, if he perus'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view'd your Reflexions.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. Your Second Answer, or rather Cavill, is, that you could make as <hi>fine sport</hi> with the word [<hi>Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi>] as I did, but that, it seems, it spoils your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. Yet you can dispence with that Formal humour very easily, as oft as a hard Point presses you, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when you are put to <hi>Proving:</hi> nor are we now to learn that you can laugh at a <hi>feather,</hi> when you have nothing of more <hi>weight</hi> to say. But, where lies the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44996:47"/>
Jest? I never excepted against the <hi>Word,</hi> but the <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applying</hi> it by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> Who, when he was at a loss to give an Answer to Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Demonstration, very learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and advisedly <hi>thought it best</hi> to deny the Conclusion, Object an Argument of his own against it, and then bid the Opponent prove his <hi>Thesis</hi> (which he had prov'd already) <hi>notwithstanding</hi> his Argument. When you find me thus untowardly making use of That, or any other, Word, you are at liberty to except against me. In the mean time put this in the number of your Reflections, that when a man pretends to make sport when there is no occasion, he but discovers his own Folly. But the Point is, Can you make good his <hi>Logick</hi> in this irregular Proceeding? This is what we expected from a writer that undertakes to <hi>defend</hi> him. But the Task is so insuperable, that neither your won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Learning, nor Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himself, nor all the World to help him can ever be able to do it; unless he can make the Schools renounce all Rules of <hi>Art,</hi> and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind their <hi>Reason.</hi> But what were my words that were so mirthful? Why, I deny'd that a Body of men <hi>could adhere to Tradition, and notwithstanding erre.</hi> Is here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occasion of <hi>fine sport?</hi> Or, cannot I use a plain word in the Context of my Discourse falling in <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally,</hi> because he had misus'd it unskillfully and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artificially?</hi> I see by this sliding over it so gentilely, this is all the Answer I am to expect to my 10, 11, 12, 13, 33<hi>d.</hi> and 34<hi>th.</hi> pages; where such Errours against all Methods of Dispute are charg'd upon the Dr. as would banckrupt any mans Credit who had not a large stock of it laid in beforehand. And all the favour his best Friends can do him to excuse his <hi>Person,</hi> is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fund it upon his <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="41">41. But, tho' it was granted that Discourse of mine
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44996:47"/>
cited by you pag. 21. was so evident, that it was both <hi>Vnreasonable</hi> and <hi>absurd</hi> to deny it, yet it must not scape without some animadversion. A Fault there must be in it, that's decree'd; and what should that Fault be, but that <hi>good</hi> one of being too Evident. And this, as was shewn formerly, is one of the new tricks taken up to evade Answering. When our Arguments are too clear to be baffled by any (even plausible) Reason, being next to self-evident, or easily reducible to it, to save us the labour you reduce it thither your self, but first vilely deform'd, that it may become a fit Subject for your Jesting way of Confuting. <hi>We will grant him</hi> (say you) <hi>it is impossible to prove that men have err'd notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they never err'd.</hi> Very excellent! But do you not grant much more; <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>It is impossible they should adhere to our Rule, and yet erre?</hi> You <hi>do,</hi> and, in doing so, you grant the whole substance of my Discourse. And so <hi>let them laugh that win.</hi> I am sure you have <hi>lost</hi> by this forc't Confession, that Tradiction is a certain <hi>Rule,</hi> and that I have prov'd it evidently. Which no man will grant of <hi>your</hi> Rule that is in his wits, nor can the wit of all the men in the World ever <hi>prove</hi> it to be <hi>such</hi> as you have <hi>yielded</hi> ours to be.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. The same disingenuity often repeated gives all the force to your next <hi>Sect.</hi> For, 1. <note n="*" place="margin">P. 22.</note> You pretend we but <hi>suppose it hitherto, that these Traditionary Christians adhere undecliningly to a Tradition descending really, and invariably from Christ and his Apostles,</hi> &amp;c. How! on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>suppos'd hitherto!</hi> Was it not <hi>prov'd,</hi> and not barely <hi>suppos'd</hi> in the Fourth Proposition, and made good by me, p. 9. If you will not come up to it, but stand ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, fencing, jesting, falsifying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and capering about by the way, must we be blam'd as barely <hi>supposing it hitherto?</hi> 2. You falsify our words: For who ever said
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44996:48"/>
a <hi>Supposition</hi> is <hi>Self-evident,</hi> which every one sees, while 'tis barely a <hi>Supposition,</hi> is not <hi>Evident</hi> at all. Why quote you not the page where we say this? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you would not be caught. 3. You falsify again without care of credit or regard to your Reader, in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that <hi>from this self-evident Supposition I necessarily conclude thus; suppose Traditionary Christians neither did nor could erre, it is certain they neither did nor could erre.</hi> But why again no place quoted! Because you had again falsify'd it, and durst not hazard disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. I perceive, your play here (p. 22.) is to disjoint our Discourse, and jumble all the pieces of it confusedly together; and, so, it must be my Work to rectify what you had so industriously unravell'd. Since then Mr. <hi>G.</hi> had made use of these words [<hi>Traditionary Christians</hi>] their Sense was first to be explain'd, and therefore I <note n="*" place="margin">My First Letter, p. 8.</note>declar'd that the meaning of them was, <hi>such Christians</hi> as proceeded upon an <hi>Immediate Delivery</hi> not only at present, or <hi>since the Council of Trent, or some hundreds of years before,</hi> as you put upon us, p. 20. but upwards till Christ's time; and all the advantage I gain'd thence was that in case they did <hi>not</hi> adhere to it <hi>all along,</hi> it would follow that the <hi>pretended</hi> Traditionary Christians (<hi>our selves</hi>) were not <hi>really such,</hi> and so the Subject of our Dispute would be lost, and we should receive a perfect foil. Could any thing be clearer or more candid? Yet, how many shuffles, and baffling Jests, you have been pleas'd to bestow on us instead of admitting so clear a Proposition; to how many wrong ends you have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd it, never thought on by us, we have already seen. For the Truth is, you are so horribly afraid of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected Discourse, that you dare not so much as suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it to peep out, but it alarums your Jealousie; no, not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44996:48"/>
the very signification of the single words to be distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known, or the most Evident Proposition, tho' it be Indifferent to either Cause, to be admitted. Now let's see what you say to it; you make it amount to this: <hi>Suppose Traditionary Christians neither did nor could err,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">P. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>it is Certain they neither did nor could err.</hi> Which you call my <hi>necessary Conclusion from my self-evident Supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> You improve mightily, Sir, in your Talent of Insincerity. Our entire Discourse runs thus, if we must needs put it into Form for you. <hi>Those who adhere to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition all along from the beginning, neither did nor could err in Faith,</hi> (otherwise they would not be Adherents to <hi>Tradition</hi> or <hi>Traditionary Christians</hi>). But this Body of Christians, call'd <hi>The Roman Catholick Church, does now,</hi> and <hi>did from time to time adhere to Tradition. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Body of Christians, call'd The Roman Catholick Church, neither did or could err in Faith.</hi> This is Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Argument: The <hi>Major</hi> is granted by <note n="*" place="margin">P. 21, 22.</note> your self. The Proof of the <hi>Minor</hi> is contain'd in Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Fourth Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, which I have shown to be valid in my First Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>p.</hi> 9. and the Discussion of it is now under hand. The <hi>Conclusion</hi> is in greatest danger, lest you should, according to the new True-Protestant Logick, deny it again, and bring some Instance against it; otherwise, since it follows evidently, it will shift well enough for it self. This, I say, is our intire Discourse; all the rest is your flashy Drollery, your ever faithful Friend, when you are perplext how to Answer.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. The Argument then for the Perpetuity of our Tradition from Christ's time, runs thus. <hi>They could not innovate in Faith, unless they did forget what they held the day before, or, out of malice, alter it.</hi> To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this Argument, I discours'd <note n="*" place="margin">My First Letter, P. 32.</note> thus. <hi>You do not, I suppose, desire we should prove that men had alwaies Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:44996:49"/>
or <hi>that Christians were never malicious enough to damn themselves and their Posterities wittingly; and yet, it can stick no where else.</hi> Yet you are such a bold Undertaker, that you will needs prove they may be <hi>both</hi> thus <hi>Forgetful</hi> and thus <hi>Malicious.</hi> A hard Task one would think; especially since the Argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon Forgetting and <hi>Altering</hi> what they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred and Held <hi>Yesterday.</hi> Your First Reason to prove they might be thus <hi>Forgetful,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 23.</note> is; because <hi>Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it is hard to say why the Pen-men of the Scripture should have been at the needless pains to write it.</hi> Let's apply this to the Argument, and your Discourse is this. 'Tis hard to say that Christians could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred their <hi>Yesterday's</hi> Faith, had not Scripture been writ. Now, pray Sir, be serious, and tell us, Do you think there is any danger, or even possibility of this among the very Protestants in <hi>England,</hi> tho' they had never a Bible to read to morrow? How many of them read not so much as a Chapter in three or four days, how many not in a much longer time; nay, how few of them read <hi>all their Faith</hi> there in a Year, or even in their whole Life; and yet they retain the memory not only of their <hi>Yesterdays,</hi> but <hi>last Years</hi> Faith? What a weakness is this, to suppose Miracles must be done for no other end, but that you may answer our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument? The Reasons why Scripture was writ, you might have read in St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi>;<note place="margin">2 Tim. c. 3.16, 17.</note> where there is no such thing as to make men remember their <hi>Yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days</hi> Faith, nor that Scripture is of Necessity at all; but only that 'tis <hi>Profitable</hi> for many Uses there enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Your Second Argument to confute our Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, is a Text, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15. by which you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, <hi>Mens memories are not alwaies so faithful:</hi> You must mean to remember their <hi>Yesterdays Faith</hi>;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44996:49"/>
for this Degree of Memory only the Argument insists on. But what says that B. Apostle? <hi>I will endeavour, that you may be able, after my Decease, to have these things alwaies in remembrance.</hi> Now, there is not so much as <hi>one Word</hi> in the <hi>whole Chapter</hi> concerning the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring or forgetting their <hi>Faith,</hi> much less the Faith they held <hi>Yesterday</hi>; or leaving their <hi>Faith</hi> in Writing for that purpose, but only (Faith <hi>suppos'd</hi>) of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring his particular Exhortations to Good Life; and, by thus inculcating them, to <hi>stir them up</hi> (as 'tis said, <hi>v.</hi> 13.) to Christian Virtue, and leaving such things in Writing to <hi>that</hi> end. Now, such Spiritual and Moral Instructions are both <hi>easily Intelligible,</hi> especially, since he had taught the same to them formerly; and Man's Natural Corruption making even good men apt to slide back from the high degree of Perfection in which they had been educated; no doubt a Letter left by that Holy Apostle, now near his death, as he there tells them, would strike them more feelingly, and <hi>excite</hi> them more effectually to pursue that Course of Holy Life, in which he had instructed them. What misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Stuff is this? Would not Faith have an excellent <hi>Basis,</hi> did it depend on Scripture interpreted by your Private Judgments. When this one Instance manifests, you have the boldness to quote Scripture for any thing, tho' never so disparate and unconcerning, and then blasphemously nick-name it <hi>God's Word,</hi> when 'tis no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to the purpose. But, I beseech you, Sir, let's have the Return of one <hi>Scholar</hi> to <hi>another.</hi> If our Argument lye too <hi>open,</hi> or the Connexion in it be too <hi>slack,</hi> speak to it as you ought; but think not your <hi>Private Interpretations</hi> a competent Solution to <hi>Demonstrations.</hi> If such wretched Answers may serve the turn, the Schools and Universities may shut up
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44996:50"/>
Shop, and Reasoning bid adieu to the World: Every Fop will find a Text he can hook in, nor will he fail of interpreting it blindly to <hi>his</hi> own purpose, when he is gravell'd with an Argument; and of calling it <hi>God's Word</hi> when he has done. Who will not see you are sinking, when you catch at such Straws and weak Twigs to keep you above Water.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. By this time the Reader will be satisfy'd, that <hi>Notwithstanding</hi> all you have answer'd, Men had <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> enough not to forget their <hi>Yesterdays Faith:</hi> Next, you go about to prove <hi>Christians</hi> may be <hi>malicious</hi> enough to <hi>alter</hi> it. <hi>May not Christians</hi> (say you, <hi>p.</hi> 23.) <hi>through malice and wickedness, be as careless of preserving the Faith, as in maintaining Holiness in themselves or their Posterity, when they know that Sin is as damnable as Errour?</hi> Be Judge your self. Do not <hi>many</hi> of your Congregation (and the like may be said of all Sects) sin <hi>often,</hi> and yet <hi>few</hi> or <hi>none</hi> of them desert their Faith <hi>once?</hi> The reasons why the Parallel holds not, are these. 1. Sins are generally private; at least, Men do for the most part endeavour and hope to conceal their Faults, for fear of shame and discredit. But the Change of Faith must be <hi>profest</hi> and <hi>open</hi>; otherwise it alters not the case; and Posterity will still believe on, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as things appear outwardly. 2. Sinners are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome Malicious to that degree, as to resolve firmly to persist so to the end of their Lives; but generally fall out of frailty, and intend and hope to repent. And so this very thing will oblige them still to hold to their former <hi>Faith,</hi> which (as Experience tells them) fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes Sinners with means of Repentance. 3. Man's Nature being inclin'd to Truth, scarce one man tells a Lye, but hopes to cloak it. But here, when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver <hi>another Faith</hi> for the <hi>same</hi> that was held <hi>Yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:44996:50"/>
every man must know his Neighbour to be an abominable shameless Lyar; and, the Concern being so Sacred, must hold himself and all his fellow-Alterers the wickedst men living<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Unless it be said they went conscientiously upon some other ground than Tradition; for to pretend to be sav'd by Tenets held upon <hi>no ground at all,</hi> is absolutely impossible to consist with Rational Nature. But 'tis impossible they should take up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ground: Because if they could not innovate in <hi>Faith,</hi> they could not innovate in that upon which they held <hi>all</hi> their Faith. Nor could they be certain, but all their former Faith might be renounc'd, if a new Rule of Faith were taken up. To hear of which, could not consist with the temper of Christians, to bear a loss for <hi>all their Faith.</hi> Besides, Men are more tenacious of their <hi>Principles,</hi> especially if they have gain'd a vast Credit by their long Continuance, than they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish all they have receiv'd upon those Principles. Again, Tradition is the Authority of the whole <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia Docens,</hi> the Chiefest part of (I might say the <hi>Ecclesia Credens</hi> too) witnessing the deliver'd Faith; which is so vast a Body, that it could never (were there nothing but its own Interest) permit it self to be thought to have attested a Lye hitherto: Add, That none could be competent Judges what was fit to be a Rule of Faith, but They who were so concern'd both in Duty and Interest, Tradition should not be set aside. Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations clearly evince an Universal Change in the Rule of Faith; and this over the whole Body of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers is absolutely impracticable. Lastly, There must be some great time between their discarding Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and espousing a New Rule; during which time, we must imagin the whole Church (except perhaps some few that discourse it first) would be made up
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44996:51"/>
of <hi>Seekers</hi>; some hovering one way, some another; in which case they would as yet have no <hi>Faith,</hi> and consequently there could be no <hi>Church.</hi> 'Tis left then, that if they could innovate in Faith, they must pretend to <hi>Tradition</hi> still when they had evidently <hi>deserted</hi> it; that is, they must profess to <hi>hold</hi> the <hi>Yesterdays</hi> Faith, when all the World must see, and every man's own Heart must tell him the contrary: Which is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Impossibility. <hi>Luther</hi> alter'd, <hi>Calvin</hi> alter'd, so did many others; but none of them had the face to say they still <hi>adher'd</hi> to Tradition, or the Faith deliver'd immediately before, and that they had <hi>not alter'd.</hi> 4. Men fall into Sins through Temptations, and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are <hi>various,</hi> according to mens Tempers and Circumstances; whence it happens, that one falls into <hi>one</hi> sort of Sin, others into another, as things light. But 'tis impossible there should have been Causes laid in the World, so Universal, as to reach a whole Body of men consisting of so many Millions of different Countries, Tempers, and Circumstances, so as to impel them effectually to fall into the same Individual sort of sin, and <hi>this</hi> such a horrid and shameful one, <hi>viz.</hi> The Altering the <hi>Faith</hi> they hop'd to be sav'd by, and this so suddenly. The Nature of the thing shows evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently 'tis above <hi>Chance</hi>; and the very <hi>Interest</hi> of the World would forbid such a <hi>Conspiracy,</hi> were there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion, Conscience, nor Common Humanity in it. Their very Passions, Disaffections, and Enmity to one another, would make them disagree in carrying on such a wicked Project: Their Natural Tempers, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting from their Common Propension to Truth, and the care of preserving their Credits utterly lost by speaking such open and pernicious falshoods, would render them apt, out of a meer Antipathy of Humour,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44996:51"/>
to oppose one another; and all this, supposing there were no Goodness at all in the World; to suppose which, evacuates all Christian Motives, and their Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, and makes our dear Saviour preach and dye <hi>in vain</hi>; especially, since there never wanted, no, not even in the worst times, a fair Degree of Disciplin to <hi>apply</hi> those Motives. Nay, State-Interest, or the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Princes, would make them glad to take hence an Advantage against their emulous Neighbours; and to think it the best Policy to lay hold on such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to fight in behalf of <hi>Faith</hi> and Common <hi>Honesty,</hi> against a pack of shameless Lyars, and Deserters both of Religion and Human Nature, who car'd not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of their own Salvation, or that of others. Lastly, Th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>se Causes thwarting the Universal Alteration of <hi>Faith,</hi> while Christians proceeded on the former Rule of Tradition; and full as much hindring the taking up a New Rule in opposition to the Testimony of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Church; as there could be no Cause to make men conspire to alter the <hi>Yesterdays Faith,</hi> so <hi>Christian Motives,</hi> which contain the greatest <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears</hi> imaginable, the Hopes of never-ending Bliss, and Fears of Eternal and Intolerable Misery, which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd and apply'd to the generality of Christians, could not, on the contrary side, but influence them most powerfully to preserve unchanged and inviolate both the Rule and the Faith. 'Tis as Certain then, that a very Great Body of Adherers to Tradition, and consequently to the first deliver'd Faith, would still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main on Foot in the World, as that <hi>Effects</hi> could not be without <hi>Proper Causes,</hi> or that <hi>Motives,</hi> which are the <hi>Proper Causes</hi> to work upon <hi>Rational Nature,</hi> will produce their <hi>Effect</hi>: I mean such Motives as engage their very Nature. Add, That such a Change must
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44996:52"/>
needs have been publickly known; and, so, have exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Pens, Tongues, Interests (perhaps Swords too) of the Traditionary and Innovating Party one against another, at the time of the Change; as we see has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in our late Alterations or Reformations. Yet no such thing was ever mentioned in History; or come to us by Tradition; or any thing alledg'd, but some differences amongst particular Spectators, and their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents siding with them; which amounts to nothing comparable to that Universal and most Memorable Concussion, such a vast Change as this we speak of, must needs have made in the whole Body of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. Summing up then this Discourse, 'tis manifest you have no way to answer our Argument, but by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing there was a time (the Lord knows when) in which there were no considerable Body of Men in the World, either good Christians, honest men, or valuing their Credit; but only a company of brutish, Godless, Lying Ruffians, without the least Degree of Grace or Shame in them. Unfortunate Confuter! <hi>Aristotle</hi> lookt upon things as they were; <hi>Plato</hi> on things as they should be; but, to make a show of an Answer to our Argument, you would have your Readers look upon the Christian World, as it <hi>neither is, was, should</hi> be, or <hi>can</hi> be.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. But you object. <hi>What if all Sons did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand aright all that Fathers had Taught them!</hi>

both so obligatory and so easie. 2. <hi>What if some Sons were so negligent as to take no care either to remember or teach what they had been taught by their Fathers? Answ.</hi> If only <hi>some</hi> were so, then those who were diligent to do this, would reprehend them, and see to have things amended, and those careless Persons, especially if Pastours, reduc'd to their Duty; there being Orders on foot in the World to oblige them to it. Besides, 'tis an unheard-of <hi>Negligence,</hi> not to know or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the <hi>next day</hi> the Faith they held the <hi>day before</hi>; nor did it require that care you pretend to retain the remembrance of it four and twenty hours. 3. <hi>What if some, through Ambition, Vain-Glory and Popularity,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>set a broach New Doctrines, and taught them for Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Tradition? Answ.</hi> If only <hi>some</hi> were so, then those <hi>others,</hi> who were good Men, and free from those Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, would set themselves to oppose them, make known their <hi>false</hi> pretences, and lay open their <hi>Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:</hi> Both Reason assuring us, that Good men use not to be so stupidly careless in such Sacred Concerns; and History informing us they were ever very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously vigilant to oppose Hereticks, when ever they began to vent their Pestilent, Doctrins. 4. <hi>What if others, to save themselves from Persecution, conceal'd part, and corrupted more of the Doctrin of Christ by their own Traditions, taken not from Christ, but from their Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Iews or Gentiles?</hi> Then those who were <hi>out of</hi> Persecution, or <hi>valu'd it not</hi> so much as they did their Conscience, would oppose their Unchristian Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: Then the Fathers, Doctors, and Pastours of the Church would <hi>reveal</hi> what they had <hi>conceal'd, restore</hi> what they had <hi>corrupted,</hi> and manifest that their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences and Subterfuges were False, and that the Doctrin they subintroduc'd, had not descended by the open Channel of the Christian Church's Tradition. 5. <hi>What
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44996:53"/>
if some through a blind Zeal, ignorant Devotion, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious, Rigour, and vain Credulity, added many things to the Doctrin of Christ; which by degrees grew into more general esteem, till at last they were own'd, and impos'd as necessary to be believ'd and practised? Answ.</hi> If they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to Faith, they could not come in, while the Rule of Tradition was adher'd to, as has been prov'd and granted: Tho' perhaps some Points involv'd in the main Body of Faith, yet so <hi>particularly</hi> or <hi>universally</hi> known, might, on emergent occasions, be singled out, defin'd and more specially recommended than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; without any Detriment to the Faith received, but rather to the Advantage and farther Explication of it. And, as for unwarrantable Practices, as they belong not to <hi>Faith,</hi> so they do not concern our present busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. 6. <hi>What if Errour any of these Ways brought forth, grew, multiply'd, spread, obtain'd most power, and drove out all that held the naked Truth out of all those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries where it came;</hi> Of which <hi>all Histories furnish us with Instances. Answ.</hi> But does any History tell you this Errour spread over the <hi>whole</hi> Church, without your supposing the Question that such or such a Tenet is an <hi>Errour</hi> which you <hi>pretend</hi> such; which is above the Skill of Historians to decide; and is only to be determin'd by examining First who have, who have not a <hi>Certain Rule of Faith.</hi> Besides, <hi>Errour in Faith</hi> never yet <hi>appeared,</hi> even though abetted by Great men in the Church, but it was <hi>oppos'd;</hi> and Truth grew clearer by the Opposition made to it; and tho' for a while it grew under the shadow of some Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular State, yet no History ever recorded, that all the States of <hi>Christendom</hi> ever joyn'd to protect it.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. Well, but what are all these rambling Questions to our Argument, which insists on the impossibility of <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

Your wise advice amounts to this, that you would have us <hi>prove</hi> our <hi>Conclusion</hi> without beginning with our <hi>Premises,</hi> or <hi>Principles.</hi> If this be Yours and Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s Logick, 'tis a very prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous one; and can only be made good by a Figure call'd <hi>Hysteron Proteron,</hi> or <hi>Cart before Horse.</hi> Though I must confess it keeps <hi>decorum,</hi> and is perfectly of the same hue with all your Logick hitherto. Please then to know that all our Faith may be Errour, if the <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Church,</hi> (our Rule) may be Erroneous: and, if it <hi>cannot,</hi> nothing we hold of Faith <hi>can</hi> be so. Again, what mean you by our <hi>proving her free from Errour?</hi> Your meaning is, we should only prove she Embraces no Errour <hi>now;</hi> but what Provision would this make for Her not falling perhaps into Errour <hi>to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row?</hi> We ought then to <hi>prove</hi> (and so ought you too of <hi>your</hi> Rule) that if we adhere to it, it can <hi>at no time</hi> permit us to <hi>Err;</hi> which could not be if at any time it <hi>might be deceiv'd it self,</hi> or leave us <hi>deceiv'd</hi> while we follow it. Besides, if it were granted <hi>Fallible</hi> or Liable to Errour, by what more evident Light, or greater and clearer Testimony could we guide our selves to know when it <hi>did actually Err,</hi> when <hi>not</hi> in deriving down <hi>Christs</hi> Doctrine?

Where 'tis shewn you, that <hi>if the Premises be right, and the Inference good, the Conclusion must be as necessarily True, as that the same Thing cannot be, and not be at once</hi>: Yet, you take no notice of it, but still run on obstinately to confute all the Schools and Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that ever Writ or Taught <hi>Logick</hi> from the beginning of the World, to the Time of His and Your Writing. The Truth is, you are sick of the Argument, and would shift it off on any Fashion.

withall, <hi>confess that a Church, following Tradition now, may leave it afterwards.</hi> This were an Incoherence with a witness: But how do you shew our Argument <hi>must</hi> prove this absurd position!

I do assure the Reader we have no where either such words or sense, and that 'tis meerly a false sham or some weak deduction of yours, for want of some better thing to say. Our Tenet is that, tho' not one single man can erre while he <hi>adheres</hi> to our <hi>Rule,</hi> yet even some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches may leave off <hi>adhering</hi> to Tradition, and so <hi>err</hi> in Faith.

                  <p n="52">52. But you sum up your Solution of our Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration with an admirable grace, or rather you give us the very Quintessence of your Answer to it in these few words.<note place="margin">P. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>The Church of Rome says all have broke the

Rule of Tradition but she onely,</hi> and <hi>proves</hi> it, by <hi>saying</hi> that <hi>she holds the same to day she did yesterday, and so up to our B. Saviours time.</hi> You proceed. <hi>We call again for a Proof of this. She tells us, If she follow'd this Rule she could never err in Faith. But did she follow this Rule? She says she did; and if you will not believe her, there's an end.</hi> How smart and victorious this looks? But the best is, 'tis wholly built on some few of your own wilfull Falsifications. Pray, where did we ever bring these Words, [<hi>If she followed this Rule,</hi> &amp;c.] For a <hi>Proof that she holds the same to day which she did ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterday.</hi> Or where did we prove we follow'd this <hi>Rule</hi> only with <hi>iffs?</hi> But why are you so shy to quote the Pages or Paragraphs where we bring these absurd Proofs? because you would be at Liberty to say any thing and yet not expose your Credit. And 'tis worth noting, that you point out the Page in other occasions very diligently; but, when you have a mind to falsify, 'tis still supprest. 'Tis observable too that this insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of yours here is of such advantage to you, that it gains the whole Cause. For, if we prove this main Point no better but with <hi>Iffs,</hi> &amp; that our Argument has no force but by standing to your Kindness in <hi>Believing what Our Church says,</hi> then <hi>there's an End indeed;</hi> for nothing can be more Evident, than, 'tis that in that Supposition, we are utterly routed, &amp; our whole Cause quite defeated. Now I would entreat the Reader (for You are resolv'd neither to use your Eyes nor Honesty, lest they should too openly accuse you) that he will once more review our Argument, as 'tis put down by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himself, First Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 4. and 5. and made good by me, <hi>p.</hi> 8. and 9. and he will see clearly, the first half of it was to prove, that <hi>If they follow'd this Rule,</hi> viz. <hi>of believing the same to day they did yesterday, they could never err in Faith,</hi> or
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44996:56"/>
were <hi>Infallible:</hi> And the other part [<hi>And they could not innovate in Faith, unless they did forget what they held the day before, or out of malice alter it</hi>] was brought to prove they did ever follow that Rule. For since nothing but <hi>Innovation</hi> can break the Chain of Tradition, whoever proves they <hi>could not innovate,</hi> proves directly they could not <hi>recede from Tradition.</hi> Nay, 'twas confest by Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himself, when he was as yet in better circumstances, (First Letter, p. 5. l. 4.) that <hi>we prov'd our Church could not innovate,</hi> by the <hi>Medium</hi> now mention'd. Yet you have the Confidence to tell the Reader, <hi>she only says she follows this Rule; and if you will not believe her,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>there's an end:</hi> Whereas you ought in candour to have said, <hi>They prov'd she follow'd, and could not but follow this Rule; but I cannot answer their Argument, and there's an End.</hi> See what you have brought upon your self, and how fatal it is to your pretended Answer, that as you <note n="*" place="margin">See above. Sect. 39.</note> began your Reply to this 4th. Proposition with a most wicked Falsifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, so you close it up here with a double one, and those too of so large a size, that were they True, they had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd all before them. Your intermediate Endeavours are many of them of the <hi>same kind</hi>; the rest <hi>Mistakes,</hi> (and generally <hi>wilful</hi> ones) which I thought at first to have reckon'd up; but they thicken'd so upon me, that I saw it would be tedious to <hi>count</hi> them, and so gave it over. But your excuse for this insincere Carriage is, That you do no more than all Writers use to do, who have had the bad luck to defend an ill Cause, and come to be prest with Close Truth. All they can do, when they are not able to <hi>give a good acount</hi> of themselves, is, to bend all their study and seek about for shifts, <hi>how they may give no account.</hi> And the D. of P. and you are of this prudent Generation. I say once again, 'Tis your <hi>Chief Study</hi> how to <hi>shift</hi>; and <hi>long Study</hi> of any thing, with frequent <hi>practice,</hi> makes a man <hi>Excellent at it</hi>; &amp; every man loves most to do that he

is Excellent at; and so we are to expect it. To convince the Reader whether I wrong you or no, Put you your Arguments for the Absolute Certainty of your Rule in conveying to us Christ's Sense, and for your following it, as close and home as you can possibly; and see whether I do not answer it directly, fairly &amp; squarely, without any of these shifting Excursions or Falsifications: And let our different Carriage be the Test to distinguish the candid Asserters of Truth, from the Insincere Abetters of Errour.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. After I had shew'd that Scripture privately inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted could not be a Rule of Faith, the nature and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of our Dispute led me into an Enquiry what was in reality <hi>your</hi> Rule, as <hi>you</hi> are <hi>such a kind of Protestant</hi>; and, to this End I discours't thus; That Scripture was a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerical Rule, common to you and all Heresies in the world; and, That your <hi>Specifical</hi> Rule must be [<hi>as my self and those of my Iudgment understand or interpret it.</hi>] And can there be any thing more Evident? Do not they all strive to lay claim to the <hi>Letter</hi> of Scripture for their Rule, as well as <hi>you?</hi> Do not they all, as much as <hi>you,</hi> rely upon it, and avail themselves by quoting it still, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to shew it favourable to their respective Tenets? Plain Experience informs us and every one, they all do this, and that too, with an ardour and earnestness equal to yours, as far as we can discern. In this then you <hi>all</hi> agree; and therefore 'tis beyond all dispute, Scripture is your <hi>Common</hi> or <hi>Generical</hi> Rule, if we may believe your Carriage and Profession. Now let's see what 'tis you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree in. And 'tis manifest you <hi>disagree</hi> in the <hi>Sense</hi> of Scripture; otherwise, the Sense of Scripture being <hi>God's Sense</hi> or <hi>your Faith,</hi> you would be of the <hi>same Faith</hi>; which cannot be pretended, since you contradict them, and they You, in matters belonging to Faith; and What's the Way to arrive at the <hi>Sense</hi> of Scripture? Certainly the <hi>Interpreting</hi> it; for <hi>Interpretation</hi> signifies in proper
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44996:57"/>
speech the <hi>Giving or Assigning to Words their sense</hi>; and do not you accept that Sense of Scripture for your Faith which your Private Judgment interpreting it, conceives to be truly its meaning; and they, in like manner, as they apprehend it, ought to be interpreted? Is it not for this very end you so cry up your Judgment of <hi>Discretion,</hi> and that you are not to submit to the Decrees of Councils or Consent of Fathers, farther than you conceive them agreeable to the Word of God? Does not Dr. <hi>St.</hi> profess openly, that his sober <hi>Enquirer</hi> may understand the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Sense of Implicit Points that are Doubtful (such as all main Points of Faith are) without the Church's <hi>help,</hi> (Second Letter, p. 21.) that is, without any Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter? And, Will you after this deny that Scripture is your <hi>General</hi> Rule in which you agree with all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; and your <hi>specifical,</hi> peculiar or proper Rule, in which <hi>you</hi> differ from <hi>them,</hi> and <hi>they from one another,</hi> is Scripture, as <hi>Interpreted by your selves?</hi> The thing is plain, let's see what you say to it. You, with a very dexterous artifice, <hi>grant</hi> and <hi>not grant</hi> it, as we shall see anon: and tell us, 1. That <hi>Scripture is and ought to be common to all Hereticks, tho' they miserably abuse it.</hi> Pray, Sir, use my words; I said, <hi>a Common Rule</hi> to them and you; and, Can that be truly a <hi>Rule,</hi> which they direct themselves by and yet warp into Errour? <hi>You</hi> tell us indeed <hi>they misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly abuse it</hi>; and the <hi>Socinians</hi> will say the same of <hi>you,</hi> while you pretend to prove thence Christ is God. And how shall this Quarrel be decided? For 'tis hitherto a drawn Match between you, while you fight with that ambidextrous Weapon, <hi>Scripture's Letter interpretable by Private Iudgments.</hi> The Point still sticks: How can an indifferent man, seeking for Faith by <hi>your Rule,</hi> be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd <hi>They</hi> abuse it more than <hi>You?</hi> Must not you be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to shew him some clearer Light than They have, and that this Light justifies you for judging thus harshly of them, that they are such <hi>miserable Abusers of Scripture</hi>?
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44996:58"/>
And, if you do not, must he not in true reason judge 'tis pretended by you <hi>gratis</hi>; as also, that you are highly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable, to charge them downright with so hainous a Crime? 'Tis that <hi>farther degree of Light</hi> in You that must justifie you for these pretences, which we would gladly see; for, whatever it is, 'tis <hi>That</hi> which distinguishes <hi>you</hi> from <hi>them,</hi> and sets you up to be <hi>Right Vsers</hi> of Scripture; that is, it gives you the <hi>Right Sense</hi> of it, or your <hi>Faith</hi>; and so it must difference you Essentially from them in your Grounds or Rule. 'Tis this Light, I say, we would be at; Why is it so shy to shew its Face? 2. Tho' 'tis hard to conceive how they can be said to <hi>abuse</hi> Scripture who <hi>follow</hi> it to their Power; yet, since you will have it allow'd you <hi>gratis,</hi> Does not their pretended <hi>miserable Abuse</hi> of Scripture consist in misinterpreting it? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you must say it does. And if so, then your <hi>right In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> of it, or your taking it in <hi>a right sense,</hi> is that in which <hi>your right Vse</hi> of it consists: wherefore your own Interpretation of it, is, beyond all Evasion, that which differences you from them; and so 'tis your <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi> or <hi>specifical</hi> Rule of Faith. 3. Do those Hereticks who thus <hi>miserably abuse</hi> it, do this out of Wilfulness, that is, do they <hi>indeed</hi> understand it right, but <hi>pretend</hi> they do not; or do they use their <hi>endeavour</hi> to <hi>understand</hi> it, and yet <hi>hap</hi> to abuse it by misunderstanding it? If the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, then again you must tell us <hi>gratis,</hi> and ought to make it out to an Indifferent man seeking for Faith, that the <hi>Socinians</hi> (and all the erring Sects) are the most wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly insincere, and the most blasphemous men in the World, nay, the greatest Hypocrites to boot; to know certainly by Scripture that Christ is God, and yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly impugn his Divinity, voluntarily abuse Scripture they seem so highly to venerate, and pretend Conscience all the while: And yet none but you have such horrid apprehensions of them: and as for my self, seeing how
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44996:58"/>
they decline no Adversary at the alledging and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Places, how sedulously they make Scripture their Study, and in all appearance adhere to the Letter; I veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe they <hi>follow it to their power,</hi> but fall into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour through their misfortune of espousing a wrong <hi>Rule.</hi> And if you still say they are thus voluntarily insincere, I desire to know of you by what outward signs can an indifferent man judge <hi>You</hi> and your Party are not as Insincere as <hi>They,</hi> or perhaps <hi>more?</hi> Acquaint us, I say, for what other Reason you say this, but because they frame another <hi>Sense</hi> of Scripture than you do, that is, <hi>interpret</hi> it differently from You? If you can give no other than your own <hi>Interpretation</hi> is the only Light you have to judge them Hereticks, or to determine what's <hi>Heresie</hi>; and by consequence to judge what's True <hi>Faith</hi>; and so 'tis unavoidably your <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> of which more by and by. But, if you say they <hi>follow</hi> it to their power, and yet err <hi>in Faith,</hi> then the fault not being in <hi>Them,</hi> for <hi>not following</hi> their Rule, their fault must be (as it is yours) their <hi>adhering</hi> to a <hi>Rule</hi> which secures not men, tho' doing their best to understand it, from falling into Heresie; that is, it consists in their pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that for their Rule, which is indeed <hi>no Rule</hi> at all.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. Your Rule then equally patronizing true Faith and Heresie, I had reason to affirm, that it inferr'd those <hi>blasphemous</hi> Propositions, as <hi>to make Light and Darkness very consistent, and Christ and</hi> Belial <hi>very good Friends.</hi> Now, this being my Charge, it was manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your Duty to shew it does not patronize true Faith and Heresie, and by doing so, induce those horrid blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies; and to make out, that only true Faith can be grounded on <hi>Scripture privately interpreted</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that I had impeach'd it wrongfully. But this was too hard a Point to meddle with. Instead of doing this, and clearing your self from Blasphemy, which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44996:59"/>
was directly incumbent on you, you tell the Reader, with a great garb of Gravity, that I speak <hi>Blasphemy</hi> my self, <hi>Blasphemy</hi> against <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Holy Word;</hi> when I only mention it while I am charging you with it. And hereupon, like a right Good man, you fall to talk <hi>Godly,</hi> and out of your pure Charity will needs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow upon me the Benediction of your <hi>hearty Prayer, that God would give me Repentance unto Life.</hi> Indeed, had I said that <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Belial</hi> could ever be <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd,</hi> or advanc'd any Position that imply'd it, as yours does, I confess, I must have been Guilty of a horrid <hi>Blasphemy.</hi> But, not knowing how to clear your self, for owning no Rule but such a one as equally patroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes Truth and Falshood, and therefore, by a necessary consequence, infers those Blasphemies; you very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murely put on a Godly Countenance, and betake your self very charitably to <hi>your</hi> hearty <hi>Prayers.</hi> As much as to say, <hi>In good Truth, Sir, I cannot answer you, nor shew I have any Rule, but what serves for Errour as well as Truth; but yet if that may excuse me, I will be content in lieu of it, to pray for you with all my Heart.</hi> Is not this pleasant?</p>
                  <p n="55">55. Thus much for your <hi>Rule</hi> as 'tis <hi>common</hi> to You and all Hereticks. What's your <hi>particular</hi> Rule? Here 1. You take it ill that we will needs know what's your Rule better than your selves do;<note place="margin">P. 28.</note> And we take it as ill of You, that you would have us believe <hi>you</hi> before our own Evident Reason. We know you cannot <hi>defend</hi> such an insignificant Rule as your own Interpretations; and therefore are forc'd to <hi>disown</hi> it, when we press you to give a good account of it; with which may very well consist, that you <hi>proceed</hi> upon it when the danger is remote. 2. You assure us <hi>Plain Scripture</hi> is <hi>your Rule;</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> (as appears by your Discourse here) <hi>your</hi> Rule as you are such a kind of Protestant. Pray, will you
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44996:59"/>
explain and unriddle to us this most obscure word [<hi>Plain</hi>] in what kind of Points, to whom, and by what kind of Light, is Scripture taken as your Rule, <hi>Plain?</hi> And let's have something more than a blind Word to work on. Experience tells us Scripture is not <hi>plain,</hi> even in the highest Points of Faith, since so many <hi>follow it,</hi> and yet go astray. Again, if it be so <hi>plain,</hi> all your <hi>useful Helps</hi> are <hi>needless;</hi> and Lastly, Scripture conceiv'd by you to be <hi>plain,</hi> which is your <hi>particular Rule,</hi> can never be made out to be <hi>Absolutely Certain;</hi> for the <hi>Socinians</hi> too proceed upon Scripture, <hi>Plain to them,</hi> as their Rule, and yet <hi>err;</hi> which evinces 'tis not so plain as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and certainly enlighten Human Reason attending to it: An evident Argument, that both the one and the other do but fancy it <hi>plain,</hi> but that, in reality, 'tis Plain to <hi>neither.</hi> 3. You declare, that <hi>the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it by any Sect of people, Romanists or others,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>is Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsical to it, and no constitutive difference of it.</hi> That <hi>the Interpretation of Romanists</hi> is not the <hi>particular Rule</hi> of <hi>Your Protestants,</hi> all the World knew before; which makes it frivolous to tell us so here. Nor do we chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge you, or pretend, that the Interpretation of <hi>any other Sect</hi> is your Rule; for we told you, that the Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>each</hi> Sect, respectively, was its <hi>particular Rule.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Your own</hi> Interpretation we said was your Rule; instead of granting or denying which, you shuffle about, and talk of the Interpretation of <hi>Romanists,</hi> and other Sects. But, if (which is strangely exprest) in <hi>other Sects</hi> you include your <hi>own</hi> too, 'tis all one to my Discourse. For, whether you regard the Interpretation of your <hi>own</hi> Sect, or make account, that as each individual Angel is a distinct <hi>Species,</hi> so each individual Interpreter among you is a distinct <hi>Sect,</hi> still Scripture, as <hi>interpretable by your selves,</hi> is your particular Rule, and not Extrinsical to it. For let me ask you once more, Is not the <hi>Sense</hi>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:44996:60"/>
of Scripture your <hi>Faith</hi>? and, Is not that Essentially your <hi>Particular Rule of Faith,</hi> that gives you your <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Faith?</hi> and, Must I mind you again, that it is the very Essence (as I may say) or nature of <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> to give you the <hi>Sense</hi> of the Words of Scripture, which in our case is your <hi>Faith.</hi> Wriggle then still which way you please, you can never avoid, but your <hi>own Interpretation of Scripture</hi> is your <hi>Particular Rule;</hi> taking you either for a whole Sect, an Individual, or Both.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. At length, as a man in danger when he is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd close at the Heels, and ready to be caught, takes a desperate leap, tho' he hazards himself a mischief; you venture boldly to declare what is your particular Rule, <hi>as differenced from both</hi> Romanists, <hi>and other Hereticks and Sectaries;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 28.</note> viz. <hi>Scripture plainly delivering a Sense own'd and declar'd by the Primitive Church of Christ in the Three Creeds, Four First General Councils, and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Fathers.</hi> After which you add, <hi>This, I hope, is plain dealing, and no wriggling; and here we take up our stand, let him endeavour to draw us whither he can.</hi> Never fear it, Sir, you are out of danger of being <hi>drawn</hi> any whither. Ten thousand Cart-Ropes will not go round you, and we must be at least Twenty Years in fastening them. But let's examin this your parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Rule. 1. I ask, whether, since Differences use to be <hi>Essential,</hi> these words, [<hi>own'd and declar'd by the Primitive Church,</hi> &amp;c.] which are found in the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of your Rule from that of others, be at all <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,</hi> or not: If <hi>not Essential,</hi> since, if you be Orthodox, you ought to have a <hi>Rule</hi> essentially distinct from that of Hereticks and Sectaries, what is this Essentially-diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Rule of yours; for 'tis this we are enquiring after? If you say <hi>'tis Essential;</hi> then Scripture had not all the due power to regulate you as to your Faith, without their additional Light: And, by consequence, Scripture
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44996:60"/>
is not your <hi>Only</hi> and <hi>Intire</hi> Rule, as you ever pretended hitherto; since <hi>these</hi> are <hi>Part</hi> of it. 2 When you say your Rule is Scripture, plainly delivering a Sense, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I suppose you must mean <hi>such a particular Sense</hi> as is <hi>of Faith</hi> with you: and can any more be requir'd to your <hi>particular</hi> Rule than <hi>Scripture plainly delivering your particular Faith?</hi> Certainly you will not say it. For, there is the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> in the Scripture, which is the Formal Motive of <hi>Divine Faith.</hi> There is <hi>Plainness,</hi> which gives it a <hi>Directive</hi> Vertue, and qualifies it for a <hi>Rule;</hi> and the Clear Light of this <hi>plain Rule</hi> must shine bright upon the particular Tenets you hold, for 'tis to shine there, and no where else. Which once put, what can all the other, esteem'd by you but Human Authorities, serve for? Can they add <hi>weight</hi> to the Divine Authority, or <hi>clear</hi> that to us which is already so <hi>plain</hi> by Scripture? 3. Pray be candid, and tell us, After a thing is <hi>plain in Scripture,</hi> are you to value a straw, what either <hi>Primitive Church, Creeds,</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> say? I dare say you will grant you are not. Wherefore, all these are utterly useless, unless they be pretended to give you some light to <hi>interpret</hi> Scripture. But this cannot be neither; both because you tell us here <hi>plain Scripture is your Rule,</hi> and it would not be <hi>plain,</hi> but <hi>obscure,</hi> if it needed an <hi>Explainer:</hi> Besides, you put this as a <hi>constitutive difference</hi> of your <hi>Rule,</hi> and yet deny'd that any <hi>Interpretation</hi> of Scripture is such, but <hi>Extrinsical</hi> to it. 'Tis then a great Mystery still, how these Human Authorities affect your General Rule, or influence your Faith already had by <hi>plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or to what end they serve but for a Show only. 4. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> proceed upon all these as much as you, and yet hold a <hi>Reall</hi> Presence of Christ's <hi>very</hi> Body in the Sacrament, as much as we do. So that <hi>this</hi> does not difference you in your Grounds or Rule from all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44996:61"/>
                     <hi>other</hi> Sects; for sure you will not deny <hi>that</hi> to be a Sect, that holds an Errour, which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has taken such pains to prove is <hi>Idolatry.</hi> My last question shall be, Whether your <hi>sober Enquirers</hi> are not to come to their <hi>particular Faith,</hi> by this their <hi>particular Rule of Faith?</hi> And, since 'tis Evident they must, we would know next how many of them are to arrive at any Faith at all? For it will take up many Years to examin and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare all the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and be sure of their <hi>Harmony</hi> with one another, and with the Scripture too. Nay, the Duration of the World will be too short to compass that Satisfaction, if we may believe the <note n="*" place="margin">Dissuasive from Popery, p 7.</note> Bishop of <hi>Downs,</hi> who assures us, That out of the Fathers succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Primitive Times, <hi>both sides eternally and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>confutably shall bring Sayings for themselves respectively.</hi> Can any man living make Sense of such stuff, or ever come at his Faith by such a Rule?</p>
                  <p n="57">57. For this last Reason chiefly, I affirm'd, That not one Protestant in a million follow'd Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s Rule, but honestly follow'd the Tradition of their own Church, Pastours or Fathers; that is, believ'd as they had been <hi>educated.</hi> To the first part of this Assertion you say little, but that if there be any Fault, 'tis the Fault of <hi>the People only.</hi> But if this <hi>peculiar Rule</hi> of yours, which takes in the seeing your Sense of Scripture <hi>own'd and declar'd by the Primitive Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 29.</note> 
                     <hi>Four first General Councils, and the Harmony of the Fathers,</hi> be to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed e're you can come at your Faith; I doubt the Fault will prove to be in the <hi>Rule.</hi> For very few Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons have Learning, fewer Leisure enough, and none of them security of having any Faith by this Method; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you could ensure their Salvation by inspiring those who are ignorant with competent Learning to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand <hi>all the Fathers</hi> and their <hi>Harmony;</hi> and withal, by letting them good long Leases of their Lives; which I
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44996:61"/>
am of opinion you cannot. The second part, that they follow'd the Method of Tradition, puts you in a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous jocund humour; and, as if you had forgot your way (a thing not unusual with you) you ask, all amaz'd, <hi>Where are we now? In the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>e're we are aware of it: We are all good</hi> Roman-Catholicks <hi>on a sudden, we are become an Infallible Church, &amp;c.</hi> and away you run with the Jest, laughing and giggling as if you had found a Mare's Nest. Surcease your fears, good Sir, you are not a jot the nearer being Catholicks for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>your</hi> own Tradition. It reaches no farther than <hi>Iohn Calvin, Martin Luther,</hi> or some such Reforming Heroe; and there it ends and stops in a flat <hi>Novelty.</hi> Whereas Catholicks abhor a Tradition that has any known Beginning, or takes a Name from any Particular Author, or has any Original but Christ, his Apostles, and the Church in the very first Age, who were the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Deliverers of it to the next, and so to the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ones. Pray Sir, what's become of your Jest? All I said, was, that <hi>You</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">First Letter, p. 27. l. 3, 4.</note> 
                     <hi>followed the Way of Tradition, however misplac'd</hi>; I prov'd it by Reasons and Instances; you hint some, omit others, and pervert the rest. You tell us, 'tis all <hi>Scriptural Tradition.</hi> But we will trust our Eyes and Experience before your bare Word. We see some taught before they can read; we see them Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiz'd in Churches, and they repeat and believe what's there told them, tho' Scripture be not quoted for the distinct Passages. We see them read the Scripture after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but we see withal not One in Thousands trusts his own Judgment of <hi>Discretion</hi> for the sense of it; but, without reluctancy or jealousie, accepts that which his Pastours assign to it; especially in Spiritual Points, or Mysteries of Faith, about which we are chiefly discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. But do not your self incline to admit (as much as we can expect from a man that affects not too much
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44996:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
candour) that very thing you so laugh at here. I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that <hi>Not one in a million thinks of relying on your Rule of Faith, in order to make choice of their Faith,</hi> &amp;c. This you answer with <hi>hems</hi> and <hi>hahs: Tho' I fear — yet I hope he is out in his Account— I am apt to think they are more attentive— Yet be it as he would have it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>P.</hi> 29.</note> &amp;c. Now, since they must either have their Faith by Reliance on their Pastours and Preachers, delivering it to them, and educating them in it, that is, by some kind of <hi>Tradition</hi>; or else by relying on <hi>Scripture</hi>; <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> and your self seems to doubt, or rather in a manner grants it, That they have it not the <hi>later</hi> way; you must at least <hi>doubt</hi> that they have it by <hi>the Way of Tradition.</hi> But your Fancy was so big with your empty Jest, that you had forgot what you had allow'd but a little before.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. Thus, Sir, I have trac'd you punctually step by step; not (as is your constant use) pickt out a few words scatter'd here and there: which you thought you might most commodiously pervert: wherefore I have reason to expect the same exact measure from you. The Sum of your Answer is manifestly this. Shuffles and wilful Mistakes without number; Evasions endless; Falsificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons frequent; Godly Talk frivolous; Jests groundless; and all these brought in still to stop Gaps when your Reason was <hi>Nonplust.</hi> Be pleas'd to leave off your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Insincerities; otherwise I must be forc't to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them yet farther; than which there can be no Task more Ungrateful imposed upon</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p n="1">1. I Come now to take a view of your Second Letter, with my Eye, as in the former, fixt only upon what I think you mean for Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Whether you give us just your <hi>First Words</hi> at the Conference; or <hi>second Thoughts since;</hi> whether no troublesome Part of Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Discourse be left out; in short, whatever belongs to matter of Fact, shall be out of my prospect, which shall be bounded by what you think fit to open to it.</p>
                  <p>You acquaint us here (<hi>Pag.</hi> 7.) that <hi>you put two Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.</hi> 1. <hi>How does it appear that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is Infallible</hi> in the <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>meaning of Tradition?</hi> 2. <hi>Is this Tradition a Rule of Faith distinct from</hi> Scripture? And you complain of Mr. <hi>G.</hi> that his Copy <hi>makes you ask a very wise Question.</hi> viz. <hi>How does it appear that the Church of Rome is Infallible in Tradition.</hi> Why this Question should be ironically call'd <hi>a very wise one,</hi> I cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. I am sure it is very pertinent to the Intention of your Dispute, and directly points at one of the Chief Subjects of the Conference. But you shall have your Will; tho' I beleive it will appear Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s question made better Provision for your Credit in point of <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:44996:64"/>
than you have done for your self.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For, your Second was in truth a very needless Question; because both your self and all your Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, if they ever heard any thing of this kind of Controversy, knew beforehand without needing to ask, that the <hi>Tradition</hi> we lay claim to, pretends to derive down the Intire Body of Christ's <hi>Doctrin,</hi> and not only the <hi>Books</hi> of Scripture, of which (<hi>P.</hi> 9.) you very learnedly seem to counterfeit your self ignorant. And this is the first part of your distinguishing the plain Sense of this Word [<hi>Tradition</hi>] as held by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> By this Question you tell us (<hi>p.</hi> 9.) you <hi>intended to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Tradition held by us</hi> [Protestants] <hi>and the Tradition disputed.</hi> For the first meaning of the Word [<hi>Tradition</hi>] which you <hi>grant,</hi> you put <hi>the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Testimony of the Christian Church,</hi> as to the <hi>Books of Scripture.</hi> The second and deny'd meaning you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra distinguish from the former in these words. <hi>But if by Tradition be understood either some necessary Articles of Faith not contain'd in Scripture, or a Power in the Church to make unnecessary to become necessary, this I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd,</hi> &amp;c. Certainly, Sir, you have a Logick of your own so peculiarly fitted to your designes, that no man living but your self ever us'd it. I ever thought, and apprehended I had all the World on my side for thinking so, that all <hi>Differences</hi> or Distinctions were to be <hi>Opposites,</hi> and to divide the Common <hi>Genus,</hi> or the Notion that was to be distinguish't; and, therefore, since the first sense of the Word [<hi>Tradition</hi>] was Tradition for <hi>Books</hi> of Scripture, which is <hi>your</hi> Tenet; I verily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the opposit sense of it should have been Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for <hi>Doctrines,</hi> which is <hi>Ours;</hi> and that, as the former was Tradition for Christ's <hi>Words,</hi> so the latter should be Tradition for Christ's <hi>Sense.</hi> But while I was vainly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44996:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
imagining the second sense of the Word would be <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for Faith,</hi> instead of <hi>that</hi> I found nothing but such <hi>Articles,</hi> and such a <hi>Power.</hi> Did ever any mortal Man think or pretend that <hi>Tradition</hi> was an <hi>Article,</hi> or a <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> any more than that it was a Horse shoe? Did your self when you granted the Latin and Greek Churches fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd Tradition,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s First Letter. P. 5.</note> intend to signify that they follow'd <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Powers?</hi> The summ then of your learned Distinction is in plain Terms this: <hi>Tradition is two-fold: One is a Tradition for Books; the other is no Tradition at all, but only Articles and Power.</hi> Had it not been better then to have accepted of Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Civility, and have answer'd to the purpose, rather than out of a pique to his Copy, and a desire to make it stand in need to be corrected, thus to pervert common sense, and out of a too zealous care not to forfeit your <hi>Wisdome,</hi> to commit such an illogical Absurdity? But Sense and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, tho' they be plain and honest true Friends, yet I must own that, like the <hi>Queens</hi> Old Courtiers, they may appear scandalous Companions to a man of your more polite and modish Education. However, I dare answer for you, it was not ignorance of their worth, but an unlucky necessity, which made you introduce in their room two <hi>New</hi> Questions to while away the time and escape the true one, which you had no mind to meet close and grapple with. Yet perhaps you may have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter luck in your First Question; let us see: By your First Question then, and your Explication of your <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign</hi> of it immediately after,<note place="margin">P. 7.</note> 'tis easy to discern that you again quite mistake the End and Use, and consequently the Nature of <hi>Tradition;</hi> which is a very inauspicious beginning, and puts us out of hopes you should ever discourse pertinently of it, since you go about to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn <hi>you know not what.</hi> For <hi>Tradition</hi> does not bring
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44996:65"/>
us down set Forms of <hi>Words</hi> onely, as you imagin, <hi>viz.</hi> (as you instance <hi>P.</hi> 7.) <hi>Christ was the Son of God,</hi> under which you say well a <hi>Heretical Sense may ly:</hi> But it derives down to us the very <hi>sense</hi> of those words, and all the rest of Christ's Doctrine; there being found in Tradition all the ways and means to signify and express the Determinate Meaning and Sense of Forefathers that can possibly be imagin'd. For, they not only deliver the Propositions of Faith in such or so many <hi>Words,</hi> as you apprehend; but, they signify to their Children the very <hi>Tenets</hi> they have in their hearts, in such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions as best sutes with the occasion, according as their different methods of explaining themselves may lead them. You may upon reflexion observe it passes thus in your self when you instruct people in their Faith: In which circumstance, you do not ty your self up to rigorous Forms of Words made to your hands, but take your liberty to deliver your self in any manner that you judge will make your meaning be best understood. The same Method is taken by the Pastours of the Church (and the Fathers of Families too according to their pitch and station.) They Catechize their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; they Preach upon the Texts proper to such Points; they dilate themselves in their Discourse, with a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to make their <hi>Sense</hi> be perfectly comprehended; they reply to the difficulties of those who are not yet perfectly instructed, or well satisfied; and accommodate themselves to all their Exigencies. Lastly, they lead their Christian Lives, and breed up others to do the same, by those Principles: And, Experience as well as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son tells us, that nothing gives the determinate sense of <hi>Words</hi> which express <hi>Tenets,</hi> more distinctly than does perpetual Practice, and Living conformably to what's signified by those Words. The want of which

Requisits in the Letter of Scripture, which can give no Answer to any difficulty, nor vary any expression to make its Meaning more Intelligible, nor live, and by Example make the Reader live according to such a sense, shews clearly, that, taking it alone and unassisted by the Churche's Tradition (determining and ascertaining it's meaning in Dogmatical Points) it cannot in any proper Speech be call'd a <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. If, notwithstanding what has been said, this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course should still seem to you more a Speculation than a Real Truth (which yet I judge impossible): pray re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect how your self would go about to instruct your own Children in your Faith; and you will easily find by experience, when 'tis brought home to your own case, how connatural this Way is to <hi>clear</hi> to them <hi>your sense,</hi> in what you would have them <hi>Believe.</hi> Do not your self use the same Method? Do you only deliver to them certain <hi>Forms of Speech,</hi> without endeavouring, by all the possible means you can invent, to imprint the true <hi>sense</hi> (that I may use your own Instance) of these Words [<hi>Christ is the Son of GOD</hi>] in their Souls; and to make it still clearer to them, as their budding capacities grow riper and riper? Do you not experience they come by degrees to understand you too; and that you have at length transfus'd into them the <hi>Sense</hi> of the Tenet you had in your own Breast? Do not you practically instil into them, that they ought to <hi>Pray</hi> to Christ; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise their Faith, Hope and Charity towards Him while they are Praying? Do not you tell them they are to give <hi>Divine Reverence</hi> to Christ; without stinting them, or making them scruple, lest they give too much, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Idolatry, by giving that to a Creature, which is only due to the <hi>True GOD?</hi> And does not this Practise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all possibility of mistake, insinuate into them, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44996:66"/>
he is <hi>equally</hi> to be <hi>Ador'd</hi> with God the Father, or <hi>Coequal</hi> to him; and, so, not a <hi>Creature,</hi> but <hi>very God of very God?</hi> I doubt not but you do all this; at least, I am sure, if you do it not, you do not your Duty: Nor do I doubt but your Children come at length to <hi>understand</hi> you too, and, by understanding you, become of the <hi>same</hi> Religion. And can you imagine, that Men were not Men in all Ages, but (in the blind times of Popery forsooth!) degenerated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Parrots, and learn'd to prate <hi>set-Words,</hi> without mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Sense?</hi> Or, that Christians were not alwayes Christians, and endeavour'd to imbue under-growing Posterity with the <hi>Meaning</hi> of the Tenets they profest; and hop't to be Sav'd by their propagating them to those whom they were bound to see Instructed in Faith? Or, lastly, can you conceive there can be any Means inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Man's Wit, to make known and propagate the <hi>Sense</hi> of Words that express Points of Faith, which is not in the highest measure found in Tradition? If you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, (as I am sure you cannot) then you must withal either confess, that <hi>Tradition</hi> brings down the <hi>Sense</hi> of Christ's Law, and not the bare <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Sounds</hi> only; or, you must advance this monstrous Paradox, that there is no possible way in the whole World for Mankind to communicate their Thoughts and Meanings to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in such Points; the contrary to which you expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience dayly in your self and others. And, were this so, then, to what end were Catechisms, Sermons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies about such subjects? To what end all Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Conferences, and Explications of them by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours? Again, if you grant these (as you must) to be the best Expedients to transmit down the <hi>Sense</hi> of Christ's Words, that is, our <hi>Faith</hi>; how can you hold <hi>Scripture's Letter</hi> the <hi>Rule of Faith:</hi> which, taken as counterdistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish't to <hi>Tradition,</hi> wants all those most effectual Means
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44996:66"/>
of discovering to us it's <hi>Meaning.</hi> Certainly, That must be the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> that is best qualify'd to give us our <hi>Faith;</hi> and that must be best qualify'd to give us our <hi>Faith,</hi> which has the best Means to give us Christ's <hi>Sense;</hi> and not that which wants all the best Means to produce such an Effect. On the other side, supposing Christ's Doctrine once settled in the Body of the Church, how can you deny <hi>Tradition,</hi> thus abundantly furnisht with the best Means imaginable to deliver down the first-taught <hi>Doctrine,</hi> to be <hi>such a Rule;</hi> seeing no more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd to be a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> but to be qualify'd with a Power to acquaint us who live at this distance with the true <hi>Sense</hi> of what was deliver'd by the Founders of the Church in the beginning, without danger of losing it by the way; which cannot be imagin'd as long as Tradition is held to, the same believ'd to day which was held yesterday, or that the immediately succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fathers still deliver'd the same Doctrin. To do which there wanted no <hi>Power,</hi> as has been lately shewn to the full; nor <hi>Will</hi> to use that Power; being oblig'd to it by the greatest Penalties GOD himself could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, the Damning Themselves and their Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But, say you (pag. 8.) <hi>If the Church may explain the Sense and Meaning of Tradition, so as to oblige men to believe that by Virtue of such Explication, which they were not oblig'd to before, then 'tis impossible the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Tradition should ly in a constant Tradition from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Son; for they have no Power to oblige to any more than they received.</hi>] How Plausibly and smoothly this Discourse runs, and how shrewdly it seems to conclude? Would any well-meaning Reader imagin that it were perfect Non-sense all the while, and wholly built on your own Liberality, giving us another sort of <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which is <hi>no Tradition?</hi> This malignant word [<hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>]
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44996:67"/>
must not be taken in its <hi>right sense,</hi> that's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd, for then it would grow too troublesom; but, take it in any <hi>other</hi> sense, that is, <hi>mistake</hi> it, and then <hi>have at it.</hi> For when you speak of <hi>explaining the sense and meaning of Tradition,</hi> you do not take <hi>Tradition,</hi> as, you know well, we do, and as the word plainly imports; for the <hi>Delivery of Doctrin,</hi> but for <hi>Doctrins Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; and so again, we have once more lost the Question. For, what can these words mean? If <hi>the Church may explain the sense and meaning of Tradition;</hi> that is, of the Method of conveying down Christs Doctrin? The Method of <hi>Delivery</hi> is the very <hi>Signification</hi> of that Doctrin from Age to Age, and how can one <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain</hi> the Sense and meaning of a <hi>signification</hi> of Christ's sense, when it's self is that very <hi>Explication</hi> of it? This gives me occasion to reflect how oddly you have hamper'd our Tradition hitherto instead of handling it. <hi>P.</hi> 9. You seem to doubt by your [<hi>If no more were meant,</hi> &amp;c.] Whether it does not mean <hi>Tradition for the Books of Scripture;</hi> and, this you knew well enough before, was <hi>none</hi> of <hi>our</hi> Tradition in dispute here; which, as may be seen by Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Demonstration put down by your self, <hi>First Letter p.</hi> 4. <hi>and</hi> 5. is confest to be Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for <hi>matters of Faith</hi> or <hi>Doctrin</hi>: Now in this new sense you give us there of <hi>Tradition,</hi> you kindly <note n="*" place="margin">P. 9.</note>
                     <hi>grant</hi> it; for 'tis your <hi>own,</hi> not that which we here mean by that word. Next comes <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note>another [<hi>If</hi>] and makes it seem to signify <note n="*" place="margin">P. 10.</note>
                     <hi>Articles</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi> And this is <hi>no Tradition at all</hi>; neither <hi>ours,</hi> nor <hi>yours,</hi> nor any body's: For, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those <hi>Articles</hi> nor that <hi>Power</hi> you speak of p. 10. <hi>are</hi> or <hi>can be</hi> the <hi>Delivery</hi> of Christ's Doctrin from day to day; for that speaks such a <hi>Method</hi> of <hi>bringing</hi> down things, not the things <hi>brought down.</hi> And this you very gravely <hi>deny.</hi> And so you may, with my good leave, either deny or expunge, or condemn it to what
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44996:67"/>
doom you please; for certainly it comes with a <hi>feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Intention,</hi> to draw the Reader out of his Road into a Labyrinth of Non-sense, and then robb him of his Reason. Again, <hi>p.</hi> 7. you make it a Delivery of bare <hi>Words,</hi> at best, with a <hi>general</hi> (impossible) sense, and perhaps a <hi>Heretical</hi> one too, into the bargain; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as you cannot but know <hi>Tradition,</hi> as <hi>We</hi> mean it, is a <hi>Delivery</hi> of the <hi>sense</hi> of Christian <hi>Tenets,</hi> and this a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> sense too; and such a one as <hi>cannot possibly be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical,</hi> while this Rule is <hi>adher'd</hi> to; unless the First-Taught Faith were Heretical, which is Blasphemy to imagin. And, here again <hi>p.</hi> 8. you make <hi>Tradition</hi> or <hi>Delivery</hi> to mean the Point <hi>delivered,</hi> and would have us give you the <hi>signification</hi> and <hi>Explication</hi> of That which is it's self the <hi>signification</hi> and <hi>Explication</hi> of Christ's Faith; and this too, the <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Sect.</hi> 2, &amp; 3.</note>very best that can be imagin'd. Is it possible to deform Tradition more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towardly, or wrest it into more misconstructions than has been done already? After a serious manner, certainly, 'tis impossible: But <hi>Drollery</hi> is now to act its part: And to cheer your spirits, which droop't under the difficulty of answering the Argument for Tradition, you put your self in masquerade; and would make the Relation of perhaps two or three, it may be, partial Friends of yours, concerning Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s Discourse about You, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect parallel to our Rule of Faith; and that, if they can mistake or misrepresent, down goes Tradition. Which amounts to this, that sooner may all the Christian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in any Age, consisting of many millions, and those disperst in far-distant Parts of the World, be <hi>mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> in their <hi>Faith,</hi> which it imported them no less than their <hi>Salvation</hi> to <hi>know</hi>; sooner may all of them conspire to <hi>deliver</hi> to their Children <hi>another</hi> Doctrin than that which they held the way to Heaven; than that a very
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44996:68"/>
few of your own Party should, to gratify you, tell you a false Story, or Aggravate; tho' all of them were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, profest Adversaries to the Person against whom they witnest; and, indeed, Witnesses in their <hi>Own</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Cause.</hi> I beseech you, Sir, tho' you be never so much to seek for a solid Answer, yet speak at least plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible things, and do not thus expose your Credit while you affect to play the Wit. Poor Tradition, what has it done to be thus misrepresented! Did it deserve no better for bringing down the Book of Scripture, but to be expos'd in so many aukward Vizards, when it was to come upon the Stage, and not once suffer'd to shew it's true face, but still <hi>travestee'd</hi> into another Form, and put in all shapes but its own? This Carriage of yours is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make the Reader think you apprehend it to be some terrible <hi>Gorgons</hi> Head, or some <hi>Basilisk;</hi> and, that the very sight of it, unless it came thus muffled up, would undo you. At least he will suspect from such an unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward broken Scene, that the Dramma is not like to be regular: Indeed you shift too often, and to catch and confute you I must travel thro' the whole <hi>Compass;</hi> for no sooner can a man steer one way, but your Discourse, like the Wind, whips straight into another quarter; and about we must tack, or we must not make forwards at all. But I will insist no more at present on this dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of yours; you will afford your Friends many fresh Instances of it, through the whole course of this Letter hereafter. Onely I must note your forgetfulness, or what else may I call it? For you took the Notion of <hi>Tradition</hi> very right, First Letter (<hi>p.</hi> 7.) where you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd you had a <hi>larger and firmer Tradition for Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> than we had for us: You did not <hi>there,</hi> take <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of that Book, for the <hi>Book delivered</hi>; for then that <hi>Book</hi> had been the <hi>Delivery</hi> of its self; and yet
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44996:68"/>
that <hi>Book</hi> had as good Title to be it's own Tradition, as you had to make the <hi>Points delivered</hi> by our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be the <hi>Tradition</hi> or <hi>Delivery</hi> of those Points. You granted too in the same place that the Latin and Greek Churches proceeded upon it; and, by granting this, confest there were as many Attesters went to make it up as there were Men, (at least Intelligent men) in the compass of the many vast Nations which those two Churches included: How come you then so much to forget your self as to parallel it <hi>here</hi> to the pittiful At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of three or four possibly prejudic't Relaters. But the reason of this self-contradicting and extravagant representation of <hi>Tradition</hi> is clear; it was your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to take it <hi>right there,</hi> and the same reason pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with you to take it <hi>wrong here.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. But I am weary of fencing with Shadows, when I can take any occasion that leads me to treat of what's Substantial. Mistake me not, 'tis not your Discourse that obliges me to it; it had been a sufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to That, to let the Reader see you purposely mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stook the Nature of Tradition, to divert and perplex his Thoughts, and there let it rest. Yet, Because your taking Tradition <hi>wrong,</hi> for the Doctrines <hi>deliver'd,</hi> good use may be drawn from it, I shall, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Reader, not decline speaking to what you object. You make account (<hi>p.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.) the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church deliver'd the Point of the <hi>`Reall Presence,</hi> &amp; of Christ's being the Son of God, in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Words</hi> onely. Which, waving what has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd in my 2<hi>d.</hi> and 3<hi>d. Sect.</hi> I judg for divers other Reasons to be Impossible. For, besides that, if the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers deliver'd onely the <hi>Words,</hi> they taught their Children (against the supposition) no <hi>Faith</hi> in these Points, for Faith has <hi>sense</hi> in it, and is not Faith if it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44996:69"/>
have <hi>none,</hi> being in that <hi>case</hi> no true <hi>Iudgment</hi> or <hi>Truth;</hi> who knows not that <hi>Words</hi> were instituted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Mankind to signify <hi>something</hi>; and, therefore, 'tis inconsistent with the nature of the same Mankind, when at Age, especially the Wiser sort, not to hold <hi>some Sense or other</hi> to be signify'd by those Words; and with the nature of Christians, not to instruct those whom they are to educate in Faith, with that <hi>Sense</hi>; as also with the nature of those who are to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed, not to desire to know the <hi>Sense</hi> of the Tenets they are to believe. But, that <hi>Sense</hi> cannot be a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> one, that is, <hi>Common</hi> to all the several Tenets now sound among us (for it will not be <hi>General</hi> if it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any one) it must therefore abstract from all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and be applicable to every one. Now there is no such <hi>Generical</hi> Notion or Sense which can be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from Christ's Body, which is <hi>Living,</hi> and a piece of <hi>Bread,</hi> unless this, that they are both <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative</hi> or <hi>Mixt Bodies;</hi> to believe which would make a very extravagant Point of Faith; much less can such an Abstraction be made from Christ's Reall Living <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and some supernatural Gifts or <hi>Qualities,</hi> either in the <hi>Bread,</hi> or wrought in our <hi>Souls</hi> by Means of our receiving the Eucharist; For a <hi>Substance</hi> and a <hi>Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> differ <hi>toto genere</hi> (as the Logicians express it) that is, belong to different Commonest Heads, which have no <hi>Genus</hi> above them, or that can abstract from them. Least of all can any such Common Notion be abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>True Son of God,</hi> and a <hi>meer Man</hi>; no more than there can from <hi>God</hi> and a <hi>Creature.</hi> Whence follows most evidently, that, since the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful must necessarily have always had <hi>some</hi> Meaning of those words in their hearts, and a <hi>general</hi> Sense of them is impossible, they must have ever had <hi>Particular</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:44996:69"/>
Notions of those Words, determining their Sense to the <hi>one</hi> signification, or the <hi>other;</hi> that is, either to mean Christ's <hi>Real Body,</hi> or <hi>not his Real Body;</hi> a <hi>True</hi> and Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <hi>Godhead,</hi> or a <hi>meer Creature.</hi> My second Reason is, because Faith is Ordain'd to <hi>work through Charity,</hi> or to stir up devour Affections in us; whence, as the distance is Infinite in both cases, between <hi>one</hi> of those <hi>Senses</hi> and the <hi>other,</hi> there being <hi>God</hi> on one side, on the other a <hi>Creature;</hi> so the Affections of the Soul wrought in us by our Faith, must either oblige us to pay an <hi>Infinite</hi> Veneration to a <hi>Creature</hi> if Christ's <hi>Real Body</hi> (and consequently <hi>God</hi>) be <hi>not there,</hi> or if Christ be <hi>not God;</hi> which is the greatest deviation from true Religion that is possible; or else, to be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Irreverent, and to want the most efficacious Motive that can be imagin'd to excite and elevate our Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he <hi>be there,</hi> or Christ be <hi>indeed God.</hi> Nor can any <hi>middle</hi> disposition be invented that can make the Acts of the Soul <hi>hover</hi> between it's tendency towards an <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Finite</hi> Being, or between an <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Finite</hi> Reverence. I dare confidently conclude then, and dare avow it to be Demonstrable out of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mankind, that either the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Sense</hi> of those Words must have been held in all Ages, ever since the Apostles time, by the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi> of the foregoing Faithful; more or less expresly, as those respective Points, broke out more or less in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christian Action; which their Duty could not but prompt and oblige them to deliver to their Children as occasion served; and consequently, that that <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular sense,</hi> and not onely (as you fancy) the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Words,</hi> must have descended by <hi>Tradition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. Next, my Position is, that, taking the word [<hi>Tradition</hi>] for <hi>Points descending by Tradition,</hi> as you
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44996:70"/>
will needs have it, the Church has Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to <hi>explain the Sense and Meaning</hi> of them, and to <hi>oblige</hi> others to believe Her; and yet, that this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not <hi>the Infallibility of Tradition from consisting in holding the same to day that was deliver'd yesterday,</hi> &amp;c. This is the difficulty, I conceive, that so much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles you. To clear which, you may please to <hi>reflect</hi> on what you know <hi>already</hi> by experience; that, let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man advance a single Tenet, and afterwards, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on occasion, set himself to <hi>Explicate at large</hi> the <hi>Sense</hi> of that Proposition; 'tis plain, there will be found in that large Explication many <hi>particular</hi> Propositions; not <hi>adequately</hi> the same, but <hi>in part</hi> different from that which he went about thus elaborately and <hi>distinctly</hi> to explain; of which perhaps even himself was not aware while he did not <hi>reflect;</hi> not being yet invited to make it clearer, or dilate on it. And yet he held, even at first, the <hi>Sense</hi> (and not only the <hi>Words</hi>) nay the <hi>whole</hi> Sense of that main Tenet or Sentence; tho' he saw not <hi>distinctly</hi> every <hi>single</hi> Proposition contain'd in it, till he became oblig'd to Scan and Study his own undistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisht, but true, thoughts concerning it. The same may be said of every Sermon and it's Text, supposing it be rigorously held to; and no more be attended to but to explain it's <hi>intrinsick</hi> and <hi>full</hi> Meaning. In which case, the Preacher sticks not to assure his Auditory, that what he has Preach't to them all the while, is <hi>Gods Word;</hi> and to press them to regard it as such, as far as his small Authority over them can reach. And, had he more, in case he did verily judge his Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Text was genuin, and, consequently, Christ's true Sense; he would questionless esteem himself bound to make use of that Authority to his utmost, to edify them with the Explicit Belief of each <hi>Particular</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44996:70"/>
in so Excellent a Truth. This being so, why should not the same Priviledge be granted to the Church and her Pastours to explicate, upon due occasion, the <hi>Sense</hi> of Christ's Faith, in many particular Propositions involv'd in the main Tenet, (even tho' we should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to be not heard of, perhaps not distinctly thought of, <hi>before</hi>) which is allow'd to every private man, and any ordinary Preacher? And, if those Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Church be, by their Office, <hi>Conservers of Christs Law,</hi> and see that these Propositions, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly singled out, are <hi>included,</hi> in any Point of <hi>Faith</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd upon their Rule; why ought they not, out of their Duty and Zeal to preserve Christ's Faith <hi>Intire,</hi> both <hi>define</hi> these Points, and also use their Authority to oblige the Faithful to accept them as such; or, if they disaccept them and express themselves against them, to exclude them from their Communion?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But still, say you, these particular Points came not down by Tradition, nor were deliver'd as held yesterday, and so upwards till Christ's Time; for they were not held <hi>at all</hi> before they were defin'd or <hi>declar'd.</hi> I distinguish: These Propositions were <hi>held ever</hi> and descended <hi>ever</hi> as they were involv'd in the <hi>Intire</hi> Point; in the bowels of which, the Sense of those others were found: But, as <hi>singled</hi> out in such and such particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing manners of Expression, they were (perhaps) <hi>not held ever.</hi> I say, <hi>not</hi> held ever formerly, at least not <hi>universally.</hi> Which is the true reason why some Private Writers, nay possibly some Great Men, might (out of a dutiful fear not to add to Faith) have doubted of them, or disaccepted them, perhaps oppos'd them; till the Collective Church, or some Great Body of them, who are able to look more intelligently into those Points, declar'd and <hi>unfolded</hi> the Sense of the main Article, in

                     </note> [where Dr. <hi>Tillotson,</hi> and my self have the honour to be brought in for writing so Catholickly].

This shews how shallow this Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of yours is, and to what mean shifts you are reduc't, since you can quote a squabbling Book of one Roman-Catholick against another about Tradition, in stead of answering the Argument for it. An ill-natur'd man might (you know very well) name Authors of another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, not too well thought and spoken of by Eminent Persons of their own side, and written against too by others. Yet I shall not be so like some I know, to turn a Dispute into a Wrangle; but shall apply my self to shew how far the Doctrine of Tradition is from deserving to be charg'd with such injurious reflexions.</p>

                  <p n="11">11. The Asserters of <hi>Tradition</hi> observing, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries they had to deal with admitted <hi>Christ</hi>'s Doctrin to be <hi>Divine,</hi> held it the most compendious way to put a speedier End to all Controversies, (which Experience taught them were otherwise liable to be spun out into a voluminous length) and the most efficacious Method to conclude all the Heterodox, of what denomination so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to prove, That the Doctrin held <hi>now</hi> by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church was <hi>Christ</hi>'s, or the self-same that was taught <hi>at first</hi> by Himself and his Apostles. It was bootless for them to attempt to prove this by Texts of Scripture, manag'd by their Private Wits; For, the <hi>Truth</hi> of our Faith depending on <hi>Christ's Teaching</hi> it, if it were not Absolutely Certain <hi>Christ taught it,</hi> it could not be evinc't with Absolute Certainty to be <hi>True.</hi> Now, the same Experience inform'd them, that no Interpretation of Scripture, made by Private Judgments, (of themselves, or others) could arrive to such a pitch of Certainty; and, consequently, would leave Faith under the scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ignominy of being <hi>possibly,</hi> and, perhaps <hi>actually</hi> false. It was to as little purpose to alledge against such Adversaries the <hi>Divine Assistance</hi> to the Church, or Christs <hi>Promise</hi> of <hi>Infallibility</hi> to it, as you very weakly object to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> (p. 16.) as <hi>not once asserted</hi> by him. For, tho' this was <hi>believ'd</hi> by the <hi>Faithful,</hi> yet it was <hi>disown'd</hi> by all those <hi>Heterodox</hi>; and, being it self a point of <hi>Faith,</hi> it seem'd improper to be produc't for a <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> Besides, how should they prove this <hi>Divine Assistance?</hi>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:44996:73"/>
If by Scripture interpreted by their Private Judgments; these not being Absolutely Certain, it would have weaken'd the Establishment of that <hi>Grand</hi> Article, which to the <hi>Faithful</hi> was a kind of Principle to all the rest, in regard that upon the Certainty of it, the Security they had of all the other Articles was to depend. If, by the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> of the Church it self, it was not so easie to defend that method not to run round in a Circle; whereas all Regular Discourse ought to proceed straight forwards. These Considerations oblig'd them to set themselves to make out by <hi>Natural Mediums,</hi> that the <hi>Human Authority</hi> of such a Great Body, as was that of the Church, was <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> or <hi>Infallible,</hi> in conveying down many visible and notorious <hi>Matters of Fact</hi>; and, among the rest, (or rather far above the rest, the Subject being Practical, and of infinite Concern) that such and such a Doctrin was first taught to the Age contiguous to the Apostles, and continued ever since. By this means they resolv'd the Doctrin of the present Church into that of <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>his Authority</hi>; and, consequently, (these being suppos'd by both Parties to be <hi>Divine</hi>) into the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority,</hi> granted by all to be the <hi>Formal Motive</hi> of <hi>Divine Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. This is the true state of that Affair. And now, I beseech you, Learned Sir, Where's the <hi>Polagianism?</hi> Where is the least Ground, or shadow of Ground, for all these bugbear words and false accusations, which, to make them sink deeper into the Reader's Belief, and create a more perfect abhorrence of our Tenet, come mask't here under an affected shew of Godliness? All hold their <hi>Faith</hi> relies on the <hi>Divine</hi> (or <hi>Christs) Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> into which they <hi>finally</hi> resolve it: and all Catholicks hold Grace necessary to believe the <hi>Mysteries</hi> of <hi>Divine Faith</hi>; tho' all, perhaps, do not judge Grace needful to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

upon <hi>Human</hi> Authority, this Matter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Christ taught it.</hi> Yet my self in <note n="*" place="margin">P. 154.</note> 
                     <hi>Faith vindicated,</hi> seeing that the admitting this Truth would oblige the Heterodox to relinquish their ill-chosen Tenets, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Church, against which they had a strong aversion; did there declare my particular Sentiment, That God's Grace and some Assistance of the Holy Ghost was requir'd, to make them <hi>willing</hi> to see the force even of this <hi>Natural</hi> Demonstration, so much against their Humour and Interest. Is it Pelagianism to conclude, that <hi>Human</hi> Motives, which are <hi>Preliminaries</hi> to Faith, and on which the assuredness of Faith it self depends, as to us, are <hi>Truly Certain?</hi> And, Might you not with as much reason say the same, if one should maintain the <hi>Absolute Certainty of our Senses,</hi> which is one of those <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminaries?</hi> How strangely do you misrepresent every thing you are to meddle with! How constantly do you make your voluntary mistake of every Point serve for a Confutation of it! 'Tis confest, &amp; ever was, That the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Authority</hi> of the Church, or Tradition, begets only <hi>Human Faith,</hi> as its <hi>immediate</hi> Effect; but, by bringing it up to Christ, it <hi>leads</hi> us to what's <hi>Divine</hi>; yet not by its <hi>own</hi> force, but by Vertue of the <hi>Supposition</hi> agreed upon, That Christ's Doctrin is <hi>such.</hi> Is it Pelagianism to say, we must use our Reason to come to Faith; or, do you pretend all the World must be the worst of Phanaticks, and <hi>use none?</hi> Or, does it trouble you, we offer to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that the Reasons we bring to make good that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary, which, in our way of Discoursing, is to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Faith, are not such as <hi>may deceive</hi> us? And that we do not <hi>confess</hi> they are <hi>Fallible,</hi> or may deceive us, as you grant of your <hi>Interpretations of Scripture,</hi> which ground <hi>your</hi> Belief? No surely, we shall not quit the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty we <hi>have,</hi> because you have <hi>none.</hi> For if it be not

Certain such Doctrines are indeed <hi>Christ's,</hi> who is our Law-giver, we cannot be sure they are <hi>True;</hi> their Truth depending on his Authority; and, would you have us for fear of Pelagianism confess all our <hi>Faith</hi> may perhaps be but a <hi>story?</hi> But, into what an unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedness does your Anger transport you, to run the Weapon through your own Side to do us a Mischief? You bore us in hand (<hi>First Letter</hi> p. 7.) that <hi>you had a larger and firmer Tradition for</hi> Scripture than we have for what we pretend to. Yet, this <hi>Tradition</hi> could cause no more but <hi>Human Faith;</hi> for I do not think you will say you had <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> before you were got to your <hi>Rule</hi> of Divine Faith. By your Discourse then your self are an Arrant Pelagian too: Perhaps worse than we, because you pretend to a <hi>larger and firmer (Human)</hi> Tradition than you say we have; nay, you pretend it to be <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> too, which is a dangerous <hi>Point</hi> indeed. Pray, have a care what you do; for, you are upon the very brink of <hi>Pelagianism.</hi> The knowing you have the true Books of Scripture, is a most necessary Preliminary to your Faith; for, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing that, you cannot pretend to have any Faith at all; and, if it be Pelagianism in us to hold such Preliminaries absolutely Certain, I fear the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may come to reach <hi>you</hi> too. Yet you have one Way, and but one, to escape that damnable Heresy; which is, that you do not go about to <hi>demonstrate</hi> the Absolute Certainty of Your Tradition, as we do of Ours. <hi>That, that</hi> is the very Venom of Pelagianism. But, take comfort, Sir, my life for yours, you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fall so abominably into the mire as to <hi>demonstrate</hi> or <hi>conclude</hi> any thing: (For, what <hi>Idaea</hi> soever you may frame of it, we mean no more by <hi>Demonstrating,</hi> but plain honest <hi>Concluding.</hi>) Your way of Discours<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing does not look as if it intended to <hi>conclude</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate.</hi>

'Tis so wholly (pass for as great a Man as you will) made up of mistakes, misrepresentations, petty cavils, witty shifts, untoward explications of your own Words, constant prevarications, and many more such neat dexterities, that whatever fault it may through human frailty, provok't by powerful Necessity, be liable to, I dare pawn my life it will never be guilty of that hainous Crime of <hi>demonstrating</hi> or <hi>concluding</hi> any thing; no, not the <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> of your <hi>fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Tradition.</hi> And, yet, unless you can <hi>prove</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi> 'tis thus Certain, 'tis a Riddle to us, how can you either <hi>hold</hi> or <hi>say</hi> 'tis such.</p>

                  <p n="15">15. Your next Prevarication is much worse. After you had shov'd <hi>Protestant Faith</hi> into <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> you throw it a Barr and a half further off by virtue of an <hi>Id est. Absolute Certainty of the Christian Faith:</hi> i. e. (say you) <hi>of the Grounds on which we believe the Scripture to contain the Word of God, or all things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be believ'd by us in order to salvation.</hi> This <hi>Id est,</hi> like <hi>Pacolets</hi> wooden Horse, has a Charm to transfer us from one Pole to the other in an instant. By virtue of its all-powerful Magick, <hi>Christian Faith</hi> is made to be the same with <hi>the Grounds on which we believe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to contain the Word of God;</hi> so that, according to you, <hi>Faith</hi> is the same with your <hi>Grounds</hi> for <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's</hi> being your <hi>Ground;</hi> that is, <hi>Faith</hi> is made the same with the <hi>Grounds for your Ground of Faith.</hi> What a medley of Sense is this, and how many folds have we here involving one another! Christian Faith is <hi>Divine,</hi> these Grounds and the Faith built on them is <hi>Human,</hi> being the Testimony of <hi>Men:</hi> Are these two the same Notion? Had I a mind to be Quarrelsome, how easily, how justly too, might I retort your former Calumny against Tradition; and object that this way of yours
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44996:77"/>
                     <hi>resolves all into meer Human Faith, meer Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> that it makes <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Grace and Assistance of the Holy Ghost unnecessary to Faith</hi>; and then ask, <hi>Is this the Faith Christians are to be sav'd by?</hi> And reckon up twenty other absurdities springing from this ill-grounded Position. But I am now to trace your <hi>transferring</hi> Faculty. In your First Letter p. 7. you speak onely of <hi>Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as to the Rule</hi> of your <hi>Faith,</hi> viz. <hi>the Scripture</hi>; but here the case is alter'd;<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>St.</hi> Second Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note> and <hi>Certainty of Scripture</hi> is turn'd into Certainty <hi>of the Grounds on which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Scripture to contain the Word of God.</hi> These slippery doings, and not any Reasons you bring, make you Inconfutable; for, we must set upon the <hi>Proteus</hi> in all his shapes ere we can bind him. The Question is not, whether <hi>Scripture Contains the Word of God,</hi> that is, his <hi>Sense,</hi> or our <hi>Faith,</hi> but (which we cannot mind you of too often, for all will be too little to make you take notice of it) how the Sense <hi>contain'd there</hi> can be <hi>got out thence,</hi> or be signify'd to us with <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> even in the very highest Points of Christian Faith, and what Grounds you have to bring about this Effect: For, you can profess no <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> of any one point, till you have made it out with Absolute Certainty, that the Sense, you pretend <hi>contain'd</hi> in Scripture is it's genuin Meaning. This is your true task, if you would prove the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Certainty of your Protestant Faith,</hi> or <hi>your</hi> Faith as depending on <hi>your</hi> Principles. But of this we hear not a syllable.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And I beseech you, to what end is it to tell us you are speaking of your <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Ground</hi> of Faith, if it carry you not thorow to any one particular; no, not those Points which are most Fundamental, and so most necessary for the Salvation of Mankind? Since,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44996:77"/>
notwithstanding you have your <hi>Rule,</hi> you are still as far to seek as before in all a Rule should be good for? Remember, the Question and Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s expectation was about the Absolute Certainty of Protestant <hi>Faith,</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of your Rule or Ground; and, therefore, if your Rule does not reach to Absolute Certainty of the main <hi>Points</hi> of Faith at least, you are still at a loss both for your <hi>Faith,</hi> and for a <hi>Ground</hi> of your Faith. Yet this, conscious of it's failure, you seem unwilling to stand to, by still sliding silently over it, or slipping by it when it lies just in your way. For, You tell us, <hi>pag.</hi> 20. that your <hi>Faith rests on the Word of God as its Absolute Ground of Certainty.</hi> Which by the way is another little shuffle; for you should have said <hi>absolutely-Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ground,</hi> not <hi>Absolute Ground</hi> of <hi>Certainty.</hi> But let that pass, and let the <hi>horse-mill</hi> go for the <hi>mill-horse.</hi> You proceed. <hi>But the particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>Certainty as to this or that Doctrine, depends on the Evidence that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in Scripture.</hi> You ought to have said, if you would make your Faith so Certain as you pretended [<hi>We are absolutely Certain such and such particular Points are contain'd there</hi>] otherwise your General Ground comes not up to the Question, nor does your <hi>Faith</hi> any service at all, since it leaves it still <hi>Vncertain</hi>; of which more hereafter. Especially, since you preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or rather declar'd openly, p. 14. that you <hi>now held all the same Doctrin that was taught by Christ and his Apostles:</hi> Which Profession reaches to <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Points</hi> of Faith, and not onely to your <hi>Ground</hi> of Faith. I must confess you render'd that Profession insignificant, and cancell'd the obligation as soon as you had made it, in the Explication of those words immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which makes those hearty expressions [<hi>Absolutely Certain of all the same Doctrin</hi>] amount to no more,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44996:78"/>
but that you <hi>resolve</hi> your Faith into <hi>Scripture. We</hi> must, I see, deal with you as those who have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in Court do with Great Courtiers; who lose their repute with them as ill-bred, and unmannerly, if they will needs take them at their word, and do not distinguish between what's <hi>spoken</hi> and what's <hi>meant.</hi> Your Answer was very honest and direct [We are <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Certain we now hold all the same Doctrin that was taught by Christ and his Apostles.</hi> The Comment is this, [<hi>I fram'd my Answer on purpose to shew that our Faith is not to be resolv'd into what Christ taught, any otherwise than as it is convey'd to us by the Writings of the Apostles &amp; Evangelists.</hi>] Whereas, if there be so much as one word of [<hi>Writing</hi> or <hi>Evangelists</hi>] even hinted in your An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer it self (unless the Word <hi>Taught</hi> meant <hi>Writ,</hi> which cannot be because we never read that Christ <hi>writ</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Books</hi>) or the least Semblance of reason, for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this Skewing Explication, but to shuffle off your too large Concession, I will confess my self too shallow to fathom the profound depth of your inscrutable sense. Resolve then your Faith, in God's Name, into what you will, so you but shew us an <hi>Absolutely Certain Connexion,</hi> between the Points <hi>resolved,</hi> and the <hi>Rule</hi> into which you profess to <hi>resolve</hi> it: Otherwise 'tis no Resolution of Faith, if the continued Chain of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives winding it up to the First Truth, or God's infinite ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, hangs slack. Such Incoherence serves not for <hi>Faith,</hi> which must be indissolubly connected to the Formal Motive of all our Faith; else the Resolution of it may be shatter'd, and broke to pieces by the way, ere we come there. Which if it may, then the Resolution is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, for that speaks <hi>Connexion</hi> of the <hi>Motives;</hi> and, Faith thus resolv'd may perhaps all be <hi>False,</hi> and so is <hi>no Faith.</hi> 'Tis your work then to shew in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44996:78"/>
when you come to it, and at present in general, that your Rule gives you Absolute Certainty of the <hi>Points</hi> of Faith, more than it does the Socinian, who have the same Rule, and profess to follow it as much as you do for your heart, and yet erre enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously. Nay, in effect they take the same <hi>Method</hi> too to interpret Scripture which you do; for, tho' you give good words to the consent of former ages, yet your Grounds do not allow it <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> in bringing down Doctrin or interpreting Scripture; and less than <hi>such</hi> a Certainty, and in <hi>such things,</hi> signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in our case. And 'tis either by your <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Method,</hi> you can arrive <hi>thus certainly</hi> at the Sense of Scripture, or by nothing. If you could once with Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Certainty convince the Socinians of Obstinacy against a Clear Truth by your Rule, or Method, or both together; I mean, if you could make it clear to them that your Rule of Faith, cannot possibly bear any other Sense, so that the indifferent part of the world judg'd them wilful adherers to a false Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or that you could silence them, and put them to open shame for adhering to it, you would do som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Otherwise, your starting aside still from the Absolute Certainty of the <hi>Points,</hi> even tho' <hi>p.</hi> 14. you pretended to be <hi>Absolutely Certain you hold them All,</hi> and talking to us of nothing but a <hi>General Ground,</hi> is meer shuffling; and shews plainly you meant not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in that Answer of yours to Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s first Question, where you spoke of <hi>all the Doctrin;</hi> which includes <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Particular Point;</hi> so that by <hi>All</hi> it seems you meant <hi>None.</hi> 'Tis very paradoxical to see you distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish here (<hi>p.</hi> 14) between the Doctrin taught by Christ, and that which was taught by the Apostles. The reason why you do it, is to insinuate into our
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44996:79"/>
Readers that we derive the source of our Tradition from Christ's Teaching <hi>orally</hi> (as the <hi>Iews</hi> affirm of <hi>Moses</hi> delivering an unwritten Law) else to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this Distinction? The Tradition we lay claim to has no such obscure Original; it takes it's <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ife from the whole Body of Primitive Christians in the Apostles days, dispers't in Great multitudes over the World, and settled in the Knowledge of his Faith by means of <hi>their Preaching.</hi> So that Tradition starts into motion from a most Publick, and notorious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Apostles taught the First Christians such a Faith. To what imaginable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose then was this frivolous distinction brought in? <hi>You</hi> knew <hi>this</hi> was our Tenet; and <hi>we</hi> knew well your <hi>Rule</hi> was Scripture. What needed then this shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Paraphrase? By <hi>Tradition,</hi> you know <hi>we</hi> mean a <hi>Testimony</hi> for Doctrin receiv'd. If the source be weak, or that the Body of the Witnessers of it's Delivery at first, and successively afterwards, was <hi>smal,</hi> the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> is, consequently, <hi>weak</hi> in proportion; if <hi>Great,</hi> it was <hi>stronger</hi> still, according as the multitude of the Attesters was more numerous, and their Credibleness more unexceptionable. Well, but admit your Faith be not resolv'd into what Christ taught by his own mouth, but what the Apostles taught us from him, why must you necessarily resolve your Faith into their <hi>Writings</hi> only? Did the Apostles when they went to convert the world go with <hi>Books</hi> in their <hi>hands,</hi> or <hi>Words</hi> in their <hi>Mouths?</hi> Or were those <hi>Words</hi> a jot <hi>less Sacred</hi> when it came from their <hi>Mouths,</hi> than when they put them in a <hi>Book?</hi> Or, lastly, does any Command from Christ appear to write the <hi>Book</hi> of Scripture, or any Revelation before hand that it was to be a Rule of Faith to the future Church? No such matter: and the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44996:79"/>
occasions of it's writing at first, and it's Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation afterwards, bar any such Pretences? On the other side, their Grand Commission was not <hi>Scribite,</hi> but only <hi>Predicate Evangelium.</hi> Yet, you can slubber this over without taking notice of it, and carry it as if the Apostles <hi>Teaching</hi> mean't <hi>Writing</hi> only, and that they <hi>taught</hi> the World no more than they <hi>writ.</hi> Sure you do not mean the Apostles took Texts out of their own <hi>Books,</hi> and preacht Sermons upon then as you do now. Why must it be quite forgotten then, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in silence, that they <hi>taught</hi> any thing by <hi>word of mouth</hi> or <hi>preacht</hi> the Gospel <hi>publickly?</hi> Allow <hi>that</hi> to be <hi>equally Sacred</hi> as what is <hi>writ,</hi> and to be embrac't if well attested, and blame the Attestation, and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as it may be found to deserve; but still, when you would put your own Tenet as distinguish't from ours, be so kind as to put <hi>ours</hi> too; and do not stand talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to us, and fooling your Readers, with the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies pretended Tradition from <hi>Moses</hi> his mouth: no more like ours than an Apple is like an Oyster. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, this Resolution of your Faith gives every one Absolute Certainty of his Faith, who believes he has Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Certainty of <hi>Scripture</hi>'s <hi>letter,</hi> and that <hi>it contains the Word of God.</hi> And yet Experience tells us that whole Bodys of Learned men <hi>believe</hi> all this, and yet <hi>differ</hi> (that is, one side <hi>errs</hi>) in the highest Mysteries of Christian Faith. Whence follows, that <hi>both sides,</hi> by this Doctrin, are <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> of their Faith; one side (for example) is Absolutely Certain <hi>there is a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and that <hi>Christ is God</hi>; the other, that<hi>there is no Trinity,</hi> and that <hi>Christ is not God.</hi> This seems but a very odd account of the Certainty of Protestant Faith.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. But you refine upon your self, in your Answer
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44996:80"/>
to the 3<hi>d</hi> Question. <hi>p.</hi> 15. It was ask't there [<hi>By what Certain Rule do you know that the New Testament which we now have, does contain all the Divine Revelations of Christ, and his Apostles?</hi> This Question evidently aims at two things: <hi>viz.</hi> First whether some Books writ by the Apostles were not <hi>lost</hi>; (as appears by those words <hi>which we now have:</hi>) For if they <hi>were,</hi> then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing penn'd by men divinely inspir'd, they must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily contain some Divine Revelations in them too, as well as did the other; and then how does it appear there were not <hi>more</hi> or <hi>other</hi> Revelations, contain'd in them than were contain'd in the books now extant? The other is, that you know well very many hold that diverse Divine Revelations were deliver'd down by Tradition, and not <hi>all</hi> by Writing. Let's see now how your Answer sutes with this Question. <hi>By the Vniversal Testimony (say you) of the Christian Church from the Apostles times downwards.</hi> This Reply, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to that Question, must mean that this <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Testimony ascertains us, that the Scriptures we have now, contains all the Divine Revelations.</hi> But, when you come to explain your self, it comes to no more but that, <hi>The Testimony of the Apostolical, and the succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches did by degrees make men fix upon the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Canon of the New Testament.</hi> What a flight have you taken on a sudden! Where will you pitch when you light? I am sure not on the place where you took wing, and where you ought to have stay'd. For, What is their Testimony for the Books <hi>we now have,</hi> to the Books which <hi>have</hi> or <hi>may have prerish't</hi> and to their containing some <hi>other</hi> Divine Revelations? Or, what is the <hi>fixing upon the Certain Canon</hi> of the <hi>Books</hi> to the difficulty, whether <hi>some</hi> Divine Revelations did not descend by Tradition <hi>without Writing?</hi> Do the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44996:80"/>
or succeeding Churches testify either of <hi>these?</hi> Or, do you so much as <hi>pretend</hi> they do? Not a syllable of this do you say or take notice of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, so, not a syllable have you Answer'd to his Question. Which was not about the <hi>Canon of Scripture,</hi> or how you would <hi>resolve</hi> your <hi>Faith,</hi> with which you keep such a pother over and over; but, whether the <hi>New Testament we have now, contain'd all the Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations?</hi> If you explicate Scripture no better for your <hi>Faith,</hi> than you do your <hi>own words</hi> here, you will questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onless make a very extraordinary piece of work of it. Your Answers come now and then pretty home, the smartness of the Questions obliging you to it; but, your Explications of them immediately after, seem pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely fram'd that we should not take you at your Word in your Answers.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. That Answer then prevaricating from the whole Question, Mr. <hi>G.</hi> endeavour'd to press for a pertinent return to what was demanded; and therefore puts his fourth Question thus. <hi>Was that Vniversal Testimony an Infallible Rule to assure us certainly down to our time,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>that the New Testament contain'd all the Divine Revelations of Christ and his Apostles?</hi> Your Answer was. <hi>The Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Testimony of the Christian Church concerning the Book of</hi> Scripture <hi>and the Doctrin contain'd therein, is a sufficient Ground to make us certain of all matters necessary to our Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. Here are many things worth our Admiration. In the First Letter <hi>p.</hi> 7. this Universal Testimony was onely to ascertain the <hi>Scripture.</hi> In the Answer to the Third Question here, 'tis onely to assure us that the <hi>New Testament contains all the Divine Revelations:</hi> But, here it is to certify us of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> too <hi>contain'd in it:</hi> which, if you mean as your Words seem to sound,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44996:81"/>
is all we require in our Tradition-Rule. There may be some other subtle meaning lying yet coucht in those Words, which Time may discover; tho' we cannot yet, till he that made the Lock bring the Key. Again, 'tis ask't if it be an <hi>Infallible Rule?</hi> Tis answered, <hi>Tis a sufficient Ground.</hi> Tis ask't, whether <hi>this Testimony assures us certainly the</hi> New Testament <hi>contains all the Divine Revelations?</hi> Tis answer'd, it <hi>makes us cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all Matters necessary to our Salvation:</hi> which is clearly intended for a <hi>diminishing</hi> expression, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues some fear of undertaking for <hi>All the Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi> being contain'd there, or <hi>All the Doctrin that was taught by Christ and his Apostles, as was</hi> pretended <hi>p.</hi> 14. One would verily imagin by this unsutable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that <hi>Dr. St.</hi> and <hi>Mr. G.</hi> were playing at <hi>Cross-pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,</hi> the Answer is so wide from the Question, at least that there is some indirect design lies lurking; it being so opposite to the wayes of honest Nature. When one asks a positive Question, all Mankind expects a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Answer to the very words as they ly, <hi>I,</hi> or <hi>No:</hi> Or, if the words be ambiguous, 'tis the duty of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer to desire to be satisfied of the meaning of the Asker, if present, ere he answers; without which, in that case, 'tis impossible to reply pertinently. But, it is not your temper nor interest to use such clear and open candour. For, you saw that great multitudes had the Letter thus secur'd to them, yet had not Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that <hi>all</hi> the Divine Revelations are contain'd in it; therefore by adding [<hi>and the Doctrin contain'd therein</hi>] you had some faint hopes you might be safe. Again, you saw well, that, should you grant Universal Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to be an <hi>Infallible Rule,</hi> you would hazard to grant too much to Tradition, and all the learned Jests you have broke upon us for asserting <hi>Infallibility</hi> would
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44996:81"/>
fly back upon your self: therefore <hi>grant</hi> it you <hi>durst</hi> not. Nor, yet durst you <hi>deny</hi> it to be an <hi>Infallible Rule</hi>; for then (since one of the two it must forcibly be) you must affirm it to be a <hi>Fallible Rule:</hi> And then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sence of all Mankind (Mr. <hi>T.</hi> amongst the rest) would be justly scandaliz'd at the non sense: For an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual <hi>Ground</hi> that may perhaps let <hi>sink</hi> into Falsity, and overturn what's <hi>Built</hi> on it, deserves not the name of a <hi>Ground</hi>; and a <hi>Rule</hi> which may perhaps <hi>mislead</hi> me when <hi>I follow</hi> it, is in reality <hi>no Rule:</hi> Besides, should you declare 'tis a <hi>Fallible</hi> Rule, Men would wonder with what sense you could pretend that a <hi>Fallible</hi> Testimony (nay, which you confess to be such) can make you <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> of the thing it attests: it being the same as to profess <hi>I grant they may all be deceiv'd in what they tell me, yet I am absolutely Certain, by their very Testimony, that what they tell me is True.</hi> What could you do then in that perplexity, being neither in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to allow <hi>Infallibility,</hi> nor avow <hi>Fallibility;</hi> and standing gor'd with both the Horns of the Dilemma or Contradiction? Why, you were forc't to call in your constant and dear Friend [<hi>sufficient Certainty</hi>] to help you out at a dead plunge. For, this is able to do more than Miracle; this can <hi>divide</hi> an <hi>Indivisible,</hi> and put a <hi>middle</hi> betwixt two <hi>Contradictories</hi>; by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World a <hi>Certainty,</hi> that is neither <hi>Infallible</hi> nor <hi>Fallible,</hi> but between <hi>both,</hi> or <hi>mixt of both</hi>; we may imagin, <hi>half</hi> the one, <hi>half</hi> the other.

In all which dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Alterations, as this due commendation must be allow'd you, to have acted very wisely and politickly; so it must be absolutely deny'd you have given any Answer at all to the Question. The <hi>Words</hi> which you would obtrude upon us for an Answer, carry indeed a pretty shew, and shift it off with much cunning; but when we come to look into their sense, with an Eye directed to the Question, they squint aside to quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters; and the whole <hi>Reply,</hi> in a manner, is made up of <hi>different</hi> Notions from what was ask't. Nor can I liken the Replies you generally make to our Ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or the Explications you make of your own An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, to any thing better than to that mock Exposition of the First Verse in <hi>Genesis,</hi> which <hi>Luther</hi> made for your Friend <hi>Zuinglius</hi>'s Iinterpretation of <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum. Deus</hi> (God) that is <hi>a Cuckow; creavit</hi> (created) that is, <hi>devoured; Coelum &amp; Terram</hi> (Heaven and Earth) that is <hi>a Hedge Sparrow with bones, and feathers and all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. You put a pretty Similitude indeed to Illustrate your own Tenet;<note place="margin">P. 17, r 8.</note> but in reference to our main Ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Absolute Certainty of your kind of Protestant Faith</hi> by <hi>your</hi> Grounds, 'tis so far from running on four legs, that it is in many regards, lame on the right,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44996:82"/>
(and indeed onely) foot it ought to stand on, and (which is worse) is perhaps against your self. You resemble the Holy Scripture to a purse <hi>full</hi> of Gold and Silver; left by a Father, and entrusted to Executours; who tell his Son, this is all his Father left him; and, if they deal truly with him, do certainly deliver all it contains. This the Primitive Church, Christ's Executours, did, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering us the Scripture; and assuring us all Divine Truths, which respect Mans Salvation, were contain'd there <hi>in the Lump;</hi> among which, some were <hi>Gold Points,</hi> some <hi>Sylver Points;</hi> but, having the <hi>Purse</hi> of Scripture, we have the one as well as the other, and, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all matters necessary to our Salvation, these being of greatest moment. Thus <hi>stands</hi> the Similitude, for, <hi>run</hi> it cannot; and the summ of it (as far as I apprehend it) amounts to this; that, because Scripture <hi>contains</hi> all, and Protestants have Scripture, therefore, they <hi>have all.</hi> A strange kind of Discourse! As if, because they have it in a <hi>Book,</hi> therefore, they have it in their <hi>Minds</hi> or <hi>Souls,</hi> in which, and, no where else, Faith is to reside. And as if a Man, were a jot the more learned, for having purchast Aristotles Works, and reading, and not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing them.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. I could except against divers particulars, presum'd on, in this Similitude; as, that you have any Absolute Certainty of your having the <hi>whole</hi> Scripture that was writ, or, that it contains <hi>all</hi> Divine Revelations; or, that you have the right Copy, to every material particle in it, that may signify Faith, that is, indeed, right Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (or the right <hi>Purse,</hi> &amp;c. But, I am more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for some plausible Insinuations in this Similitude, which may hazard to corrupt the Reader's Judgment. For, however, you decline and avoid it, yet the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Readers, whenever they hear any speech of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44996:83"/>
the <hi>Certainty</hi> of the Grounds of their Faith, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately apprehend they are to be Certain of the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Points</hi> of their Faith by vertue of those Grounds. And, 'tis a common Errour in many, of an indifferent good Judgment, (I wish it did not sway with some who pass for great Schollars) that, when a thing easily sinks into their <hi>Apprehension,</hi> they are apt to conceit it to be a <hi>Truth.</hi> When, therefore they hear of a Purse, which is a thing very easy to open, (it being no more but pulling two strings which use to run very glib;) and, that Scripture is in many regards, here compar'd to a Purse; they are presently inclin'd to fancy, that, Scripture's sense is as easy to be come at, as 'tis to take money out of a Purse: 'Tis but plucking those easily following strings, and the deed is done. But, alas! Here lies all the difficulty. The <hi>Arians, Novatians, Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> &amp;c. have all of them this Purse, yet are never the richer; but, for want of skill to open it, and get the Gold and Silver thence, they go away empty, or worse. Now, certainly, those high points, <hi>viz.</hi> A Trinity, Christ's Divinity; the Real Presence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be reckon'd amongst the <hi>Golden</hi> Ones; and, therefore, should be as most valuable, so most easily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable; being of the highest import for the <hi>Church,</hi> or the <hi>Body</hi> of Christianity. Yet, 'tis granted the Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Err in the two first of those Points, for all their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteness and wit. I except next against the resembling the Contents of it to <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi>; which certainly <hi>enrich</hi> those who are Possessours of such a <hi>Purse:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, those Sects lay claim to that Purse too with equal Title, yet, coming to open it by their Interpretation, they take the <hi>Dross</hi> of Errour for the pure <hi>Gold</hi> of Truth, and Soul-poysoning <hi>Heresies</hi> for <hi>means of Salvation.</hi> Had I a mind to set up a similitude-mender, and, that you will
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44996:83"/>
needs have it a <hi>Purse,</hi> I should beg your leave to put it thus: Suppose that Purse's Mouth were tyed up with a knot of such a mysterious contrivance, that none could open it (I mean still, as to the understanding the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of our Faith) but those who knew the Mind of the Bequeather; and, that the <hi>Church,</hi> to which it was left as a Legacy, had knowledge of his <hi>Mind,</hi> and so could open it; while others tortur'd their Wits with little tricks and inventions, turning and winding the ambiguous folds of it, some one way, some another; and yet entangled their own thoughts, more and more, while they went about to unty the Knots that so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex't them.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. This is the true case. You make account <hi>contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> does all the business; whereas, 'tis nothing at all to our purpose, which is (in the final Intention of it) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Absolute Certainty of your Faith</hi>; unless we have equal assurance that you can <hi>get out thence</hi> what's <hi>contain'd there,</hi> as you pretend to have, that <hi>'tis contain'd.</hi> Now, it cannot be deny'd, but the Primitive Church was imbu'd with <hi>Christ's sense</hi> by the Preaching of the Apostles and their immediate Successours; and so had a <hi>sure</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> Way to interpret Scripture; and, while this <hi>sense</hi> was still deliver'd down, they could not fail of an absolutely Certain Rule to understand it right.</p>
                  <p>But, there steps up now one Heretick, then another, opposing himself to the <hi>sense</hi> of the Church; and, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying on the dextery of his own wit, will needs find out contrivances how to open the <hi>Scripture's</hi> Meaning by wayes of his private Skill: But falls into multitudes of Errours, finding no way to unfold the deeply-my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious Book; having refus'd to make use of the right means, <hi>viz.</hi> Christ's <hi>sense</hi> descending in the Church by <hi>Tradition.</hi> Whence, notwithstanding all his little Arts
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44996:84"/>
and boasting presumption like the Fox in the Fable, <hi>Vas lambit, Pultem non attingit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. Mistake me not: I do not mean Scriptures Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not clear in such passages as concern Common Morality, or the Ten Commandments; with the Sense of which every one is imbu'd by the Light of Nature. Nor in matters of Fact, such as were most of those <hi>Marks</hi> or Signs to know the <hi>Messias</hi> by, foretold us by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; our Saviour's doing such and such Miracles, his <hi>going beyond Iordan, &amp;c.</hi> Nor in Parables explain'd by himself, and such like. But, in Dogmatical Points or <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> which are <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and oftentimes profound <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,</hi> (and, of these, by the way, I desire still to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, when I speak of the Certainty of the Letter or Sense of Scripture, for with other Passages I meddle not) as the Tenet of a Trinity, Christ's God-head, the Real Presence of his Body in the Sacrament; and such like; which have a vast Influence upon Christian Life; either immediately, or else in a higher Nature, being (as it were) Principles to many other Articles of Faith, which depend on their Truth: One would verily think, I say, that such as these should be some of your <hi>Golden</hi> Points, or else there were none at all contain'd in your <hi>Purse:</hi> Yet, we experience, That even in such as <hi>these,</hi> your Rule is not intelligible enough to keep the Followers of it from erring. So that, let your Purse have never so <hi>Golden</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> a lining, you are never the <hi>richer,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you can come at it, or can certainly distinguish the pure <hi>Gold</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> from the impure Dross of Errour. Your Similitude then comes not home to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, nor shews that you have therefore <hi>all</hi> your <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>all Divine Revelations,</hi> because you have a Book which you judge <hi>contains</hi> them. Let's see now if it does not make against you. You put the Doctrin (or
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44996:84"/>
                     <hi>Points</hi>) of Faith to be the Gold and Silver <hi>contain'd</hi> in the <hi>Purse;</hi> and, consequently that must be the Purse into which that Doctrin of Faith <hi>was put</hi> by Christ our Saviour; and this was evidently the <hi>Heads,</hi> and <hi>Hearts</hi> of the Faithful. For the <hi>Points</hi> of Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so many Divine <hi>Truths,</hi> are onely <hi>contain'd</hi> in Men's <hi>Minds</hi> properly; and, <hi>Words</hi> being, by their very Definition, but <hi>Signes</hi> of what is in our Minds, <hi>Truths</hi> are no more really in a <hi>Book,</hi> than <hi>Wine</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a <hi>Bush</hi> which signifies it. Since then those Truths were onely in the Breast of <hi>Christ</hi> Originally, and, after him, in that of the Apostles; and their Thoughts could not be communicated, nor consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Gold and Silver deliver'd to the Legatees, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than by <hi>signifying</hi> it, which can onely be done by one of these ways, by <hi>Living Voice and Practice,</hi> or by <hi>Writing</hi>; that is by <hi>Tradition</hi> or <hi>Scripture,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these can with any Sense be liken'd to the <hi>Purse</hi> it self, into which the money is to be put, or answer comparatively to It; but they are both of them <hi>Wayes, Means</hi> or <hi>Methods</hi> of putting these heavenly Riches into it's Proper Purse, the <hi>Souls</hi> of the Faithful. Of these two Ways our Saviour chose the <hi>First;</hi> which was Teaching his Doctrin <hi>orally,</hi> for he <hi>writ</hi> nothing; and by doing thus, told us it was the <hi>better:</hi> For, it had been against his Infinit Wisdom to chuse the <hi>worser</hi> way for Himself to make use of, and leave the <hi>better</hi> to his Servants. Nor, did his servants, the Apostles, affect the Way of <hi>Writing,</hi> so as to use it <hi>onely</hi>; but, on the contrary, they made use of this <hi>Oral</hi> Way of Preaching <hi>constantly,</hi> and that of <hi>Writing</hi> (for the most part at least, if not altogether) <hi>occasionally.</hi> They converted the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church by their <hi>Preaching;</hi> they comforted the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Church by leaving many most edifying Words, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44996:85"/>
Actions of our Blessed Saviour, <hi>Written;</hi> which being <hi>Particulars,</hi> and not breaking out openly into Christian <hi>Practice,</hi> might otherwise in likelihood, (at least to a great degree) have been lost to succeeding generations; besides the abetment their Writings give to Faith it self, when certainly interpreted, and rightly understood. So that, according to this discourse of yours we should ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have never a Purse to put Points of Faith in, for you take no notice of the Souls of the Faithful into which they are properly put, and in which onely they are in reality <hi>contain'd:</hi> Or, if you will needs call that a Purse which <hi>contains</hi> them meerly as a <hi>Sign</hi> does the thing <hi>signify'd,</hi> or as that which may signify to us our Faith, you must put <hi>two</hi> Purses: <hi>Tradition</hi> and <hi>Scripture:</hi> And then the onely Question is, out of which Purse, we can with more Certainty get it. That is, whether a Living Container, which can give us perfect light of it's <hi>Sense</hi> by <note n="*" place="margin">See above, Sect. 2. &amp; 3.</note> all the best ways imaginable; or the Dead Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which, as Experience demonstrates, can neither clear it's Sense to Private Understandings; nor, if we <hi>doubt</hi> of it's Meaning, and had a mind to <hi>ask</hi> it, could ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>hear</hi> or <hi>reply,</hi> much less pertinently, and appositely speak to the Asker as oft as he had occasion to press still for satisfaction. Again, the <hi>Written</hi> Instrument or Means of putting this heaven-stampt coyn in our Souls, is an Ignoble Instrument in comparison; being in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, as to it's Material part, or taken as abstracted from the Sacred Sense which is signify'd by it, nothing but Ink thus figur'd on Paper. Whereas, the material part of the <hi>other</hi> is the most Noble that can be found under Heaven it self: <hi>viz.</hi> the Church which all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans must acknowledge to be the <hi>Spouse of Christ,</hi> the <hi>Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi> and consisting of the Living Temples of the Holy Ghost; That, for whose edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44996:85"/>
the Scripture was writ; and, so, holds proportion with it as the Means does with the End, which is in a manner Infinit. Nay, That, for which all the Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial World was created, and the Oeconomy of it still carry'd on, from the first beginning of Time to it's last Period. Lastly, That for whose sake God himself was made Man, and dy'd a most cruel Death on a Cross. So that 'tis unconceivable, that it can enter into the thoughts of any intelligent man who believes this to be the due Character of the Church, there should be any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition betwixt the Letter of Scripture and it; or that it can possibly be doubted to which of them (all things consider'd) we ought to attribute most in looking after Faith. But, to return to your similitude. The sum of it is this: That the Gold and Silver you speak of, being the Doctrin of Faith; not the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but the <hi>Heads,</hi> and <hi>Hearts</hi> of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> (that is, of the Church) does really and indeed <hi>contain</hi> it; and, consequently, this onely can with any propriety be compar'd to a <hi>Purse.</hi> That, both Tradition and Scripture are to be liken'd to the several Ways of putting the Heavenly Treasure of Faith, into this Purse, or Faith into the Souls of the Faithful. Lastly, that taking them as <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi> them, as signes do the things signify'd, it is not their <hi>containing</hi> this Treasure does us any good, but the <hi>delivering it out</hi> to us; no more than a man is better for having a Trunk full of Money so circumstanc't that he could never come at it: and, that, between these <hi>two ways</hi> of coming at this Treasure, or their <hi>delivering</hi> it out to us there is no comparison, whether we regard the Intelligibleness, or Providential Establishment of those respective Instruments in order to such an End. So that your similitude, how prettily soever it look't at first, hath one misfortune very common to such fine useless
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44996:86"/>
toys, that is, to be good for nothing; for it neither comes up to the Question, nor sutes with your own Tenet.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. But ere we part from this Point, it were not amiss to examin a little that cautious expression of yours [<hi>all things necessary for salvation</hi>] into which you change that bold assertion that you are <hi>absolutely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you now hold all the same Doctrin that was taught by Christ and his Apostles.</hi> I ask you then, what do you mean by those words [<hi>necessary for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi>] which mince the matter so warily? Do you think Christ taught any <hi>unnecessary</hi> Points, or did a <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> action! Sure you will not say it. And yet my self will grant too, and agree with you that fewer Means than the Knowledge of <hi>all Christ taught,</hi> may suffice for the Salvation of <hi>some</hi> particular persons. What follows then, but, that, since they are <hi>all</hi> necessary for some body, and yet not all necessary for <hi>every</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar person, more of them are necessary for <hi>one</hi> man than for <hi>another,</hi> and all of them necessary for the body of the Church: whose Pastours are to instruct their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in them, and apply the Efficacy of them to their Souls, as their capacities admit, and exigencies require. For, tho' some few may be saved without the knowledge of such &amp; such Points, (slender Motives being enough for their circumstances,) yet multitudes of others may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire incomparably more effectual Means, to buoy them up from the World, and raise them to heaven; and so, they would certainly miscarry for want of them. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, the points now mention'd, are of such a high and general Influence, that, without these, the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a very great portion of the Church, would be enfeebled, many of the Souls that want them be lost eternally, and others be but dim Stars in the Glorious Firmament of Heaven, in comparison of what they
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44996:86"/>
might have been, had their Minds been cultivated with such elevating considerations. And, can the <hi>Church,</hi> which God has entrusted with those Souls, think that 'tis agreeable to his Will, his Flock should ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dy, or fall short of the full growth they might have had in the plentiful Pastorage he had provided for them? It rests then for you, either to shew those Points not <hi>necessary</hi> for the Generality, and that your Grounds are sufficient to give men, both as able and as willing (for ought appears) to understand Scripture right as your self is, <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> of Them (which is to confute Experience, and dispute against your own Knowledge,) or else to confess ingenuously you have no Absolute Certainty of even the highest Fundamentals, and <hi>most necessary Points for the Salvation of Mankind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. Thus much to shew that your Rule gives you no Absolute Certainty of <hi>all such matters as are necessary for your Salvation,</hi> with reference to the <hi>Points of Faith;</hi> to certify which, Experience assures us it does not reach. Now, should we speak of the <hi>Assent</hi> of Faith, the <hi>Short Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> p. 30, 31. of my former Letter, demonstrates clearly you can have no Absolute Certainty of any one, and so cannot with reason affirm your Faith is <hi>True;</hi> since, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Absolute Certainty that Christ taught it, it <hi>may be False.</hi> The same point has been prest upon you in <hi>Faith vindicated, Reason against Raillery, Errour non-plust,</hi> and diverse other Books: yet tho' it was the most important objection that is or can be imagin'd, as plucking up by the roots all your Faith, and destroying it from it's ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Foundation; no return could ever yet be obtain'd, nor candid Reason produc't, but onely a put-off with <hi>sufficient Certainty,</hi> and such dow-bak't words; without being able or even endeavouring, to shew that Grounds less than <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> can possibly be thus <hi>sufficient</hi>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:44996:87"/>
for the <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Vses</hi> of Faith. But 'tis high time to return to our Disputants.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Against this pretended Answer of yours, you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce Mr. <hi>M. suggesting several things.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 18.</note> First, <hi>As to difference of Translations.</hi> To which you reply. <hi>Doth Mr.</hi> M. <hi>think our Faith is to be resolv'd into the Original Texts?</hi> What he thinks, you know better than you would seem to do. He cannot but think, if he may believe you, that you resolve your Faith into the <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture.</hi> He cannot but think that by these words you mean <hi>the Right Letter;</hi> for, otherwise, it would not be <hi>Scripture:</hi> Nor can he think, or you ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it can be the <hi>Right Letter,</hi> unless it have a <hi>Right Translation,</hi> and this, from a <hi>True Copy;</hi> nor that any <hi>Copy</hi> can be <hi>True,</hi> unless conformable to the <hi>True Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</hi> And, if there can be any failure in <hi>any of these,</hi> nay, if you have not Absolute Certainty of <hi>all these,</hi> you cannot have (by your Grounds) any Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of your <hi>Faith:</hi> For, if the Letter be wrong, all is wrong that is built on it: and it may be wrong, for ought you know, notwithstanding the Testimony of all Christian Churches relying on this Way of attest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth of the Letter. For, you can never shew that all those Churches consented to apply their utmost diligence to examine and attest all the several Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, made in their respective languages; or witnest that they came from the true Original; or took the most exquisit care that was possible, to see that the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and the Copiers did their duty. Which, had they held the Letter to be their onely Rule of Faith, and, consequently, that <hi>All Faith,</hi> that is, the very <hi>Being</hi> of the present and future <hi>Church,</hi> and their own <hi>Salvation</hi> too, depended on the Scripture, they were obliged in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and under the highest Sin, above all things in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44996:87"/>
the World, to have done; and this, with the exactest care imaginable: <hi>Your</hi> Grounds then, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all you have said or alledged hitherto to ensure the Letter, make no Provision for the Absolute Certainty of the Written-Rule, nor consequently of your Faith.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. But <hi>what becomes then</hi> (say you) <hi>of the Vulgar La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Translation?</hi> I answer, in our Grounds no harm at all:<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> For the Canon of the <hi>Books</hi> comes down by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of all Christian Churches that are truly Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; and the Doctrin of Christ, transfus'd into the hearts of the succeeding Faithful ever since the beginning, both taught them <hi>how,</hi> and oblig'd them to correct the Copy in those <hi>particular Texts</hi> that concern'd <hi>Faith,</hi> if any Errour through the carelesness, unattentiveness or malice of the Translaters or Transcribers at any time had crept in. By the same Means as you can now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days correct the Copy in those Texts, that ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press some Point of Morality, in case it were corrupted, and deviated from Christian Manners; <hi>viz.</hi> by vertue of the <hi>Sense</hi> of that Practical Tenet you were imbu'd with formerly; &amp; this, even tho' you had no other Copy or Text to amend it by: Insomuch that, how good an opinion so ever you had of the Copy, Translater, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Correcter of the Press; yet, for all that, you would conclude they had <hi>err'd,</hi> and the Letter was <hi>faulty,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than forgo the <hi>Doctrin</hi> so firmly rivetted in your heart by the constant Teaching and Practice of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian world. As for other particular Texts of an Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Concern, they could be best corrected by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of other ancient Copies (the Churches Care still going along) in which too the greatest care that was possible to rectify it's Errours was taken by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent,</hi> that so it might be as exact as Human Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence could well render it. A thing, as far as my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

reaches, never order'd or very much regarded by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Council formerly.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. But I foresee, your method of confuting (which is to muster up Extrinsecall objections not at all to the purpose) will naturally lead you to discredit this way of correcting Scripture's Letter in passages belonging to Faith, as <hi>singular</hi> or <hi>New;</hi> This being the same your Friend <hi>G.

This is my Iudgment, and (as I conceive) a True one; that whatever</hi> (Text) <hi>is useful to build Faith on, was not better translated by any than it was writ by the Apostles themselves. And therefore, as oft as any thing occurs in the Latin-Books, that seems to make against Faith or Good Manners, the Interpreters of</hi> Scripture, <hi>either ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from other Words in other places what that doubt should mean; or they compare those doubtful sayings to the living Gospel of Faith, which was infus'd into the Hearts of the Faithful, throughout the Vniversal Church; &amp; which, before any man writ it, was Preach't by</hi> Christ <hi>to the</hi> Apostles, <hi>and by the</hi> Apostles <hi>to the whole World; &amp; examine them by the inflexible Rule of Faith; with which if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make it square, they conclude, that either they do not understand it, or the Book is faulty</hi>] where he passes by the former way with a sleight word <hi>[expiscentur] fish out</hi> the <hi>sense;</hi> but insists on the latter way of preserving the Copy sincere, as <hi>Certain</hi> and Proper.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. I must not pretermit your Objection p. 19. that <hi>the Ancient Christian Church never knew any thing concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Method of resolving Faith into meer Oral Tradition.</hi> I would desire you to add [<hi>Practical</hi>] to <hi>Oral;</hi> at least to conceive it to be <hi>understood</hi> all the way, that being our True and constantly-avow'd Tenet. But, did the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Church, in reality, never know any thing of this way? Tis wonderful you should not understand they <hi>meant</hi> the same as we do, unless they speak the <hi>self-same Words,</hi> and make the <hi>same Discourses</hi> we do now. Did not they all hold, that who taught any thing contrary to the Doctrin delivered down by the Church, was a Heretick? Did any of them say that the Churche's <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of a Doctrin, as Christs, was liable to Errour? Did any of them hold that it was lawful for your <hi>Sober Enquirer</hi> to rely on his Private Interpretation of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44996:89"/>
and relinquish the sense of the Church, which is the true Point? Not one. 'Tis one thing to say they oft quoted Scripture against Hereticks, who had rejected the Authority of the Church, (even the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> does so;) another, to say they had no firmer <hi>Ground</hi> for their <hi>Faith,</hi> but their own <hi>private Iudgments</hi> of it's <hi>sense.</hi> Tis one thing to give it high Commendations for it's Excellency, Divine Doctrin, Usefulness and Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency for the Ends for which it was Ordained by God: 'Tis another, to say that, in those places which relate to <hi>Spiritual</hi> Points and high <hi>Mysteries</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> it is so clear, that, private Fancies can with Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty <hi>fix</hi> upon it's <hi>true sense,</hi> and, on <hi>that,</hi> Ground their <hi>Faith.</hi> Tis one thing to say sometimes, 'tis <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Evident,</hi> when they are Arguing against Hereticks: this is a thing not unusual even among us, when we are disputing, and have an opinion that what we alledge is manifest; and those Fathers or Councils which insisted on it, had good reason to have that opinion of what they alledg'd, having the Doctrin of Faith, (Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's best Interpreter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) in their hearts: Besides, when there is full assurance of it's sense, who doubts but it is of a vast <hi>Authority</hi> too; being in that case the same as if the Apostle or Christ himself were there, and spoke his Mind in the Point under debate. Whence they confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hereticks with defining from Scripture; upon the assurance that they had the true sense of it <hi>another Way,</hi> than the Heretick had by his <hi>private Interpretations.</hi> But, 'tis another thing to say, that, as manag'd by Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Judgments, working on the bare Letter, or relying on Fallible Interpreters, it is so unavoidably convictive, beyond all possibility of giving it another plausible sense, that all Mankind must think him a Renouncer of the clear Light of Reason, or stark blind with Passion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44996:89"/>
and Interest, and abhorr him as such, who shall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it after another manner. And such the Rule of Faith must be, otherwise, none could with Conscience <hi>think</hi> or <hi>say</hi> any Heretick is obstinate, nor any man (no not the Church it self) <hi>condemn</hi> him, much less <hi>abhorr</hi> him for being, such, as was ever her Custome. <hi>All</hi> the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Perfections we as heartily, fully, and constantly ascribe to Scripture as any Protestant in the world: nay, we say moreover, that this want of Clearness which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualifies it for being a Rule, springs from a very high perfection in it; <hi>viz.</hi> It's <hi>deep Sense;</hi> onely this <hi>one,</hi> of giving every particular man, who by his private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Interprets it, such assurance of its sense as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to Ground his Faith on, we cannot grant; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no less contrary to common Reason, than 'tis even to Experience also. To return then to your Objection. You see <hi>Sect.</hi> 10. that the Antient Fathers were not such Strangers to this Method of <hi>Tradition</hi> we follow and explicate. And, you might have observ'd many others both nam'd and cited, <hi>Surefooting</hi> p. 131. to 137. What matters it that they did not <hi>express</hi> That our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, or <hi>Dilate</hi> upon it in such Terms as we do now; so they taught others to <hi>hold to what was deliver'd,</hi> and not to rely on their own private Interpretations of Scripture against the <hi>present</hi> Churches Doctrin? Since in doing this, they held the <hi>substance</hi> of that which we have since more diffusely explain'd, and reduc't our Discourses to more Methodical and Formal Resolutions of Faith, which were not so much in fashion in former Ages. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, you are not to be told we both <hi>have</hi> &amp; <hi>could</hi> alledge Fathers enow for our Tenet, and the Obligation to hold to the Doctrin deliver'd from Fathers, that is to <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;</hi> and how smartly and unanswerably they prest it against Hereticks, as a certain Determiner of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44996:90"/>
between the Catholicks and Them. On the other side, how often they complain'd of the <hi>Vncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of the Scripture interpreted by private Men, as Grounding all Heresies; by reason of the mysterious Obscurity of the Letter, and its liableness to be misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted and misunderstood? Whereas, it was never heard that the Rule of <hi>Tradition</hi> taken in the sense, in which we hold it (<hi>viz.</hi> for a Delivery of a Practical Doctrin, publickly preach't to great multitudes at first, practised by them, and held, and recommended as <hi>Divine,</hi> and the way to Salvation) did ever give rise to any Heresy, and impossible it should. Which one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion to a Considerate Man, is sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the whole present Controversy about the <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="30">30. From the <hi>Qualities</hi> requisit to <hi>make</hi> Scripture's Letter a <hi>Rule of your Faith,</hi> we come to consider the <hi>Quantity</hi> it ought to have, or the <hi>Number of Books;</hi> which you tell us <hi>p.</hi> 19. Mr. <hi>M.</hi> suggested. In order to which, I have onely two things to ask you. 1. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as I said formerly, you have any <hi>unanimous Consent of the Christian Church,</hi> that there was never a Book <hi>lost</hi> that was writ by some who were <hi>Divinely inspir'd;</hi> and, consequently, did contain <hi>some</hi> Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Or, if you cannot prove but there was, how do you know but those Divine Revelations, which that Book or Books contain'd, were not different from, or to be superadded to those, contain'd in the Canon <hi>we have now?</hi> If you cannot prove these two Points, then 'tis manifest you cannot prove with Absolute Certainty, that the Books <hi>Wee have now,</hi> contain'd <hi>all</hi> the Divine Revelations. 2. You insist onely on this Universal Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony for the Canonical <hi>Books</hi> of the New Testament; but, I would know whether this Testimony reaches to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44996:90"/>
each <hi>Chapter</hi> and every <hi>Verse</hi> of those Chapters, nay, each material <hi>Word</hi> in those <hi>Verses?</hi> If it does not, as you neither say, nor with any Reason can say (for 'tis hard to prove the former, &amp; impossible to prove the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but by our Rule) then you are as far from your Faith as ever; unless you bring some other Testimony that is <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> to assure you that such and such a <hi>Verse,</hi> which you would quote and rely on for such and such a Point of Faith, nay, the main and most sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant <hi>Word</hi> in that Verse is <hi>true Scripture:</hi> which, I am sure you cannot: For, what Testimony else can be invented to do this, if the other, which was of the <hi>whole Christian Church,</hi> cannot reach it? Is there any possible way to ascertain this, but by our Doctrin-Rule? Upon this occasion, pray inform me with what reason you could reflect so severely pag. 15. on the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> for not receiving the <hi>Epistle to the Hebrews</hi> in St. <hi>Hierom</hi>'s Time, assoon as other Churches; and, not on the Greek Churches, (which you use to prefer before the Latin) who, in the same Father's time, refus'd to admit the <hi>Apocalypse?</hi> The accepting or not accepting such Books, even according to your own Doctrin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on their being satisfied of the <hi>Evidence produced for their Apostolical Authority;</hi> and so was an Act of <hi>Prudence,</hi> antecedent to the Judgment or Determination of any Church, whether Greek or Latin. But, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable is your pique against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that she cannot act <hi>prudently</hi> without forfeiting her <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</hi> Tho', another man would have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, it was rather a very commendable cautiousness in the Latin &amp; Greek Church too, not to admit into such a sacred Roll, Books that were not yet clearly prov'd to be authentickly such; than a blameable Lapse, or so hainous a Crime, that for committing it, she must needs
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44996:91"/>
lose all her Title to Christ's promis'd Assistance.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. This gives me occasion to ask you what becomes of Your <hi>Rule,</hi> and, consequently, of Your <hi>Faith</hi> all that while? If the Letter of the Canonical Books, that is, of the <hi>whole Canon</hi> of the New Testament be your Rule, and those Books were <hi>part</hi> of this <hi>Canon,</hi> they must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be <hi>part</hi> of your <hi>Rule</hi> too; whence it follows that your Rule was not <hi>Intire,</hi> but <hi>deficient</hi> for some hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of years, till the whole Canon was Collected and Acknowledg'd. I see you do but complement with the Primitive Church of the first 300 years; and, that you onely cry it up to avoid the unkindness, which the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages shew to your Cause; for, by your Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, you cannot but hold that the Ages which <hi>follow'd</hi> it, are to be <hi>prefer'd:</hi> Since <hi>These</hi> had your <hi>intire</hi> Rule, the <hi>Others</hi> wanted <hi>some parts</hi> of it; and sometimes held but <hi>three parts</hi> of it, <hi>half</hi> of it, or less, (and so, by your Principles, were but <hi>three quarters</hi> or <hi>half</hi> Christians) according as the several pieces came by degrees to be acknowledg'd, and universally accepted. I doubt Mr. <hi>M</hi>'s Discourse about the <hi>Number of Books,</hi> more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexes you, than your are willing to make shew of. For, pray, <hi>how many</hi> of these Books go to make up your Rule of Faith? If any one, or some few, then you should not have stood upon the Canon <hi>we have now;</hi> that is, <hi>all</hi> the Apostolical Books, or <hi>Scripture</hi> in general. If <hi>all</hi> the Canonical Writings be your Rule, then perhaps the Primitive Christians had but <hi>half</hi> their Faith, or <hi>less;</hi> it may be <hi>none at all,</hi> because, wanting yet those other Books, they wanted necessary places to <hi>compare</hi> those Texts with they already had; which is a great part of your Method to find out your Faith in Scripture. Pray, satisfy us about this exact <hi>Number of Books,</hi> and how many will just serve the turn; and, make some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44996:91"/>
cohere; for, I cannot for my heart as yet find any thing that does. You talk to us of a <hi>Purse,</hi> and say it must be <hi>full;</hi> but, when we come to look at it more narrowly, it appears to have been for some time but <hi>half</hi> a Purse, and wanted <hi>one side</hi> of it, at least had a great <hi>Hole</hi> in it: so that you put us into an apprehension, that many of the <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver Points</hi> might have dropt out of it in the time of the Primitive Church; by which Church notwithstanding, and no other, in our disputes about Faith, you seem heartily willing to be judg'd.

Nor need it be recounted how many Orthodox Christian Churches did not accept diverse Books formerly. And, tho' after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as you say well, they came <hi>by degrees to fix on
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44996:92"/>
the Certain Canon of the New Testament,</hi> yet I am apt to judge that this was not perform'd by Immediate <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 15.</note> For, the Witnesses were long ago dead, and their Grand-Fathers too, who could attest that such a Book was indeed, to <hi>their knowledge,</hi> written by such an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle or Evangelist. It descended then by <hi>Oral Tradition</hi> in those respective Churches. Whence, as that Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was not so Practical, so it was restrain'd to some few in each Church, and was withal, very narrow at first in comparison of our Tradition for Christ's Doctrin; which was, in a manner, universally and publickly preach't and practis'd. Now the <hi>strength</hi> of a Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the <hi>largeness</hi> of it are to be taken from the largeness of the first Attestation; and all that after-Ages can do, when they attest such things, is to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that they received it from some others; but so, that the Tradition was still <hi>narrower</hi> as it came nearer the fountain; which very much weakens it. By what other Lights the Church guided her self in her accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting such and such Books for Canonical Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to another place. Your Tradition then was not Universal for Scripture in the first 300 years, and its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Attestation was <hi>weak</hi> in comparison of that which was for <hi>Doctrin.</hi>

I have little to say to your <hi>Explicit</hi> or <hi>Implicit</hi> Points contain'd in Scripture: For, I see they are both equally to no purpose, while but <hi>contain'd</hi> there, till you bring us a Rule to <hi>interpret</hi> the Letter with <hi>Absolute Certainty.</hi> If any ought to be <hi>explicitely</hi> there, none can have so good a Title to it as those high and most Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Articles spoken of so often; yet we see there are no places producible for <hi>them,</hi> but may have <hi>other</hi> senses given them; and bear (as experience shews us) not yet ended, and, for ought we know, endless Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44996:92"/>
among your <hi>sober Enquirers</hi> attending to your <hi>Rule.</hi> Onely I a little wonder you should say <hi>'tis sufficient for your purpose, that all Doctrin of Faith necessary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are contain'd in</hi> (the Letter of) <hi>Scripture, either expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly or implicitly.</hi> If they be <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> they must be <hi>necessary to be believ'd</hi> or <hi>known</hi> to be there; for they must <hi>save</hi> men by <hi>believing</hi> them, and <hi>acting</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Belief, or <hi>no way;</hi> and, if they be onely <hi>implicitly</hi> there, they are as yet <hi>unknown,</hi> or <hi>not believ'd:</hi> So that, according to you, that is a Point <hi>necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> which does not at all conduce to it. But, I wonder more at the happiness of your <hi>Sober Enquirer</hi> to whom, you affirm and stand to it stoutly,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> those Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Points <hi>will become Explicit without the help of the Church;</hi> and yet you call it <hi>assuming,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to do the <hi>same,</hi> or <hi>declare the Sense</hi> of such Articles. Certainly, this <hi>Sober Enquirer</hi> is your special Darling, and Favourit. <hi>He,</hi> tho' a <hi>private</hi> person, can discover those <hi>Explicit</hi> Points; and I suppose may <hi>declare</hi> them too, to as many as he pleases; for how can he in Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty do less? But alas! The silly insignificant <hi>Church,</hi> can do nothing at all; she must submit to the wondrous Gifts, you have bestow'd upon the Rabble, and her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors and Pastors be accounted Tyrants if they shall dare to encroach upon their high Prerogatives, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to share in their Priviledges of being able to <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi> or <hi>know</hi> the Explicit Meaning of Scripture-Texts: For, in case they can <hi>know</hi> this, and this Knowledge be good for the Faithful (as it is, being as you say <hi>necessary to Salvation</hi>) 'tis without question they may <hi>declare</hi> them, or <hi>make them known</hi> to others: nay, and use their Authority too (if you will vouchsafe to allow them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) to edify the Faithful by making this Knowledge sink into them. Nor can it prejudice their Reason, that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44996:93"/>
the Church obliges them to <hi>believe</hi> them; for this is no more than obliging them to act <hi>according to</hi> Reason; which tells them that, since they must either trust them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves or their Pastours in such things, and the Pastours must be incomparably better qualify'd than themselves are, for the discovering of such mysterious Truths, and withall appointed by God to teach them; 'tis far more Rational to <hi>submit</hi> to <hi>their</hi> Judgments in such things, than to <hi>use</hi> their <hi>own.</hi> But, indeed, you have reason to stand up for your <hi>Sober Enquirer;</hi> for all Ring-leaders of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Heresy, or Faction against the Church, took this very Method in their proceedings. The Spirit of Pride, which possest them, principled them with these Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal and Peaceable Maxims, that they had Authority to <hi>judge</hi> their Judges, <hi>teach</hi> their Teachers, <hi>direct</hi> their Guides, and that their own Wit <hi>excell'd</hi> that of all the World before them. But, when a Faction was form'd into a good lusty Body, the Scripture-Rule was laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side again; so that 'tis doubtful whether we have had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a <hi>Sober Enquirer</hi> since, as was shewn in my First Letter Sect. 25.</p>

If you demand how the Roman Church came by this knowledge of making Implicit Points <hi>Explicit?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, by Tradition, giving her the Sense of Christ's whole Law, and each Intire point of it; and by the Light of Nature purify'd by supernatural knowledges antecedently; as also by her Application, when occasion required, to reflect upon, and penetrate deeply into that

                     <hi>Sense;</hi> which enables her to explicate her own thoughts (or the Points of Faith) more clearly now; which she <hi>had</hi> indeed <hi>before,</hi> but did not so distinctly <hi>look into</hi> them, or set her self to explain <hi>them.</hi> But pray, what <hi>express Scripture</hi> has your <hi>Sober Enquirer</hi> for his Power to make the <hi>Implicit</hi> Points <hi>Explicit?</hi> You reckon up diverse <hi>agreeablenesses</hi> p. 21. why this should be; but not one word of <hi>express Scripture</hi> do you pretend to for it.

You say p. 21. that <hi>the Church of Rome has no where declar'd in Council it has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such Power;</hi> viz. to declare explicitly Points imply'd in Scripture. But, First, you may please to know It <hi>has</hi> made such a declaration Sect. 4. where it defines that it belongs to the Church, <hi>judicare de vero sensu et interpretatione Scripturarum, to judge of the true sense, and Interpretation of Scripture;</hi> Next, It, accordingly, proceeds upon this Power, as I shall manifest by three several Instances.

Where it declares the Text, 1 Cor. 1. <hi>Let a man examin himself,</hi> &amp;c. to be understood by the <hi>Custome</hi> (or Practice) of <hi>the Church,</hi> of, <hi>Sacramental Confession,</hi> necessary to be us'd before receiving the Sacrament by all those who are conscious to themselves of <hi>mortal sin.</hi> The Third, Sess. 14. cap. 1. where it interprets that Text of S. <hi>Iames</hi> cap. 5. to be <hi>by Apostolical Tradition</hi> understood of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44996:94"/>
the Sacrament of <hi>Extreme Vnction.</hi> Which places you do not judge so much as <hi>implicitly</hi> to contain that Sense, but hold that they contain another thing. How the Churches declaring explicitly Points descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Tradition, makes no new Articles of Faith, is discours't above, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4, 5, 6, 7. By which, you may see that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> and Mr. <hi>M.</hi> whom (pag. 22.) you will needs set at variance, are, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, very good Friends. For, if the Church knew the the <hi>sense</hi> which is contain'd in that place, <hi>before;</hi> the Doctrin is <hi>Old,</hi> tho' the declaring it to be signifi'd by that particular Text, be perhaps <hi>New.</hi> I say <hi>perhaps;</hi> for, in some signal passages, much in use in the Churches Preaching, Catechisms and Practise; I doubt not but that, not only the particular Doctrin, but also that 'tis signifi'd by such a Text, comes down by Tradition in the <hi>Ecclesia docens.</hi> Notwithstanding the agreeableness of these two Positions, you triumph mightily here p. 23. that, <hi>Thus Mr.</hi> M. <hi>has answer'd Mr.</hi> G<hi>'s Demonstration.</hi> As much as to say, <hi>I know not for my life what to say to it my self, and therefore, would gladly shift it off upon any Body, so I could handsomely rid my Hands of it.</hi> Thus, you <hi>make</hi> (for you can <hi>make any thing</hi> by your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of <hi>mistaking every thing</hi>) the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> clash with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (a hard Task one would think!) by <hi>pretending to interpret</hi> Scripture <hi>according to the unanimous sense of the Fathers;</hi> which you judge <hi>contradicts the making known, and obliging Men to believe that explicitly now, which they were not oblig'd to by any precedent Sense or Explication.</hi> What mean the words [<hi>Men</hi>] and [<hi>They</hi>] If they signify <hi>all men,</hi> and intend to signify that <hi>no man</hi> knew those imply'd Points before, but <hi>all</hi> might hap to contradict them, you mistake our Tenet: for, we judge it absolutely impossible that <hi>none</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:44996:94"/>
of the Fathers should reflect more attentively on the <hi>full</hi> sense of the Points deliver'd, or look into their own thoughts as Faithful; and, therefore, it was much more impossible they should <hi>unanimously contradict</hi> those Points. And, unless they did so, the Council of Trent, and the Church of Rome may, by the Grace of God, very well correspond in their Doctrin for all your mistake. For the Intention of the Fathers in that Decree (Sess. 4.) was to repress the insolency of Hereticks wresting the Scripture to their own private sentiments [<hi>contrary to the Sense of the Church, or the unanimous Consent of the Fathers.</hi>] And how this is <hi>directly contrary</hi> to this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of obliging to believe somthing, as in Scripture, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly <hi>now,</hi> which was not so known <hi>before,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable; unless you will prove that that <hi>Explicit</hi> Sense is directly <hi>contrary</hi> to the unanimous Consent of the Fathers or the Church, which you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do. But, tis a trivial Exploit to make Mr. <hi>M.</hi> clash with Mr. <hi>G.</hi> or the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> you can make that very Church clash with her self— <hi>Suis et ipsa Roma</hi> — and that openly and professedly too: Nay, which is most wonderful, fall out with her self about her own Prerogatives. For, you tell us p. 23. that <hi>tho' it has assum'd this Power</hi> now spoken of, yet it <hi>still disown'd</hi> it. Now to <hi>assume</hi> a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, is to <hi>challenge</hi> it; and to <hi>disown</hi> it, is to <hi>renounce</hi> it; which hang together much alter the rate of all your Discourse hitherto. This Church of Rome is a most monstrous kind of Creature: It goes <hi>backwards,</hi> and <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> blows and sups, declares <hi>for</hi> and <hi>against,</hi> and all at once: but we must imagin her to be such onely as she stands pourtray'd in Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s Fancy.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. Your main Stratagem to elude all this discourse, remains yet to be more fully detected, tho' it has been
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44996:95"/>
occasionally toucht at diverse times formerly. Tis this, that you <hi>are now upon the General Ground of Faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>and not the particular Acts of it, or the particular Certainty as to this or that Doctrine.</hi> And you seem to have reason for it too, because <hi>the main point in Dispute</hi> was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Protestants could shew any Ground</hi> of <hi>Absolute Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for their Faith.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 24.</note> And this you think justifies you for hovering in the ayr, and onely talking of your Scripture-Rule <hi>in common,</hi> without lighting on or applying it to any one particular point contain'd in that Rule. But this will avail you nothing. For, first; Neither does <hi>our</hi> Discourse pinch upon any <hi>one</hi> particular Point, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Uncertainty of your Faith <hi>in general,</hi> or on <hi>all</hi> your Points of Faith at once as built on <hi>your</hi> Ground. So that, 'tis the pretended <hi>Ground</hi> of your Faith we are disput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against all the while, and not <hi>any one</hi> particular Tenet. We bring, indeed, Instances now and then of some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Articles; but, 'tis to shew that, if your Ground has not power to ascertain absolutely those <hi>most Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental</hi> Points, it has power to ascertain <hi>none;</hi> and, so, is no <hi>Ground</hi> of Faith <hi>at all.</hi> Secondly, A <hi>pretended</hi> Ground cannot be known or acknowledg'd to be a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>firm Ground,</hi> till we see it grounds <hi>somthing,</hi> It's Notion plainly imports a <hi>Relation</hi> to the <hi>Superstructure</hi>; and you may as well prove a man a <hi>Father</hi> without prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he has a <hi>Child,</hi> as prove any thing to be a <hi>Ground</hi> without proving such and such Points to be <hi>grounded</hi> on it; and this (in our case) with <hi>Absolute Certainty.</hi> Pray, take <hi>that</hi> along with you still, otherwise you turn your back to the Question, and run away from it in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Field. Tis tedious and mortifying beyond measure to hear you still <hi>talking,</hi> and <hi>pretending</hi> you have an <hi>Absolutely Certain Ground</hi> for Faith, and yet never see
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44996:95"/>
you, so much as once, endeavouring to shew how it's Ascertaining Virtue affects the Articles you build upon it; and that <hi>this</hi> particular <hi>Sense</hi> of Scripture in each respective Point has such a close, and <hi>necessary Connexion</hi> with the <hi>Letter</hi> on which 'tis built, as to give Absolute Certainty of it to all that are competent Judges of the Sense of Words. Which the Experience of all Ages since Christ confutes, and our own Eyes <hi>Witness</hi> to be false in the <hi>Socinians</hi> and others. Thirdly, Your self confest once upon a time that you <hi>are absolutely Certain you now hold all the same Doctrin that was taught by Christ and his Apostles.</hi> Now,<note place="margin">P. 14.</note> this candid expression would make any honest well-meaning man verily believe that you meant you had been absolutely Certain of <hi>every</hi> particular <hi>Christian Doctrin,</hi> by vertue of your Ground or Rule. But your incomparable dexterity quite and clean over-reach't us. For, when you came to explain your self there, it amounted to no more but that your Faith was <hi>resolv'd</hi> into Scripture (that is, that you <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> to Scripture) which <hi>contains</hi> all, or as you told us p. 17. that you were absolutely certain you <hi>hold</hi> all, because you hold all, not in your Soul or Mind (where Points of Faith are to be <hi>held</hi>) but in a kind of <hi>Purse</hi> as it were; as one is said, when he holds a Book in his hand, to hold all that is in it: being possest of which, tho' you cannot come at it's sense (which is little better than if it were lock't up in a Trunk) you are in <hi>possession</hi> of all Christian Faith notwithstanding, and <hi>hold</hi> very firmly (in <hi>that</hi> Sense) <hi>all that was taught by Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</hi> Fourthly, Hence you have not perform'd what you undertook, viz. to shew that Protestants had any <hi>Absolutely Certain Ground</hi> of their Faith. For, 'tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to <hi>point out</hi> a <hi>Book,</hi> and <hi>cry</hi> out aloud <hi>Tis your Ground,</hi> but you must <hi>shew,</hi> that 'tis <hi>indeed</hi> such a Ground.
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:44996:96"/>
Now a <hi>Ground</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> bears in it's notion <hi>Evidence</hi> to those who are to use it, and to know other things by it's Direction; Nay more, <hi>Clear</hi> Evidence: For, as all <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> must have some kind of <hi>Evidence</hi> to create it in us, so this Effect of <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> can have no less than <hi>Clear</hi> Evidence for it's Cause. But, you may as easily prove Mankind has no Eyes to see with, as go about to shew that the Letter of Scripture is thus clear in order to the discovery of right Faith, even in the highest and most concerning Points of our Christian Belief. Fifthly, Tis pleasant to observe what a rare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of your Faith you give us p. 24. <hi>Our Faith</hi> (say you) <hi>is resolv'd into the Scripture as the Word of God, and whatever is built on the Word of God, is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Certain.</hi> You must, indeed, having deserted the Tradition of the Church, either pretend to Scripture, or nothing; unless you will confess your selves to be pure Phanaticks or Pagans: and it looks mighty plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly to say, that <hi>whatever is built on the Word of God is absolutely Certain;</hi> for 'tis a great Truth. But the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Point is still, Are you <hi>absolutely-certain</hi> by your Grounds, that your Faith is <hi>indeed built</hi> on the Word of God? You <hi>say,</hi> indeed, Scripture is your <hi>Ground,</hi> you <hi>pretend</hi> to it as your <hi>Ground,</hi> perhaps you <hi>think</hi> it so too; and, 'tis not about your <hi>saying, pretending</hi> or <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it to be such, that we dispute with you; for we should not scruple to grant you all this without any Dispute at all: But does your <hi>saying, pretending</hi> or <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prove</hi> it to be so <hi>really,</hi> and <hi>indeed?</hi> All Heresies in the world do as much as this comes to, and yet are no less Heresies than if they did none of this. Tis your <hi>Proving</hi> it to be <hi>your Ground</hi> (and that an <hi>Absolutely Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> one too) which we would be at; but, we justly complain you flinch from the onely thing in Dispute
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44996:96"/>
and perpetually balk us. We tell you once more, (and we cannot repeat it too often) there is a necessary Connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion between the <hi>Ground</hi> and the <hi>Building;</hi> for, 'tis not a <hi>Building</hi> if it have no <hi>Ground,</hi> nor the <hi>Ground</hi> of a <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> if nothing be <hi>built</hi> on it. You are then to shew us Absolute Certainty of this <hi>necessary Connexion</hi> between the <hi>Scripture</hi> and your <hi>Faith,</hi> or you do nothing but talk at random. But, alas! You have not the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to make out this, or produce your Reasons to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elude this Ground and this Building have such a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Relation; and I must tell you plainly, <hi>you can never do it.</hi> For, pray, tell me, May not the Socinians, and indeed all Hereticks that ever arose in the Church, <hi>say, pretend,</hi> and (perhaps) <hi>think</hi> the same that you do? Nay, do not they all <hi>alledge</hi> the same? Do not they all profess to <hi>resolve</hi> theit <hi>Faith</hi> (I mean their abominable <hi>Errours</hi>) into the <hi>written Word?</hi> Do not they pretend it for their <hi>Ground,</hi> and, that they <hi>build</hi> their prophane Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets on it; &amp; lastly, avow as stoutly as you do for your heart, that <hi>whatever is built on</hi> Gods <hi>Word, is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Certain?</hi> Will you allow these Pleas Argumentative for them, or, that their wicked <hi>Errours</hi> are therefore <hi>true</hi> Faith and <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> because they <hi>alledge</hi> all this! And can you be so unreasonable as to expect we should pass that for a good Argument, or a conclusive Reason to prove <hi>you</hi> have <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> for <hi>your</hi> Faith, which your self disallows, when 'tis alledg'd for <hi>them;</hi> nay, which <hi>you</hi> must disallow and declare against, unless you will patronize all their Heresies? Pray, lay your hand on your Heart, and consider (I am sure, 'tis more your own Good, than mine, you should) into what a La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable, or rather Chimerical Condition God's Church is reduc't by your Resolution of your Faith here, and the Account you give of it. The <hi>Pillar and Ground of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44996:97"/>
Truth,</hi> is reduc't by you into a confused <hi>Chaos</hi> of inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Errours; <hi>Christ's</hi> immaculate <hi>Spouse</hi> is associated with all the Adulterate Synagogues of <hi>Sathan</hi>; lastly, <hi>Faith</hi> as to it's Certainty is in no better a Condition than Heresy, and Heresy is upon even Ground with Faith. I have a better opinion of the Church of England, than to believe Her most learned and genuin Members, will own such a Resolution of her Faith, as will make the Socinians, and all other Hereticks in the World their fellow-Christians and Brothers; as they must be forced to do, if they own no other Resolution of it than all those pestilent Sects unanimously profess. I see Mr. <hi>G</hi> had good reason to ask you in his 5<hi>th.</hi> Question, <hi>What Churches you accounted Christian Churches?</hi> For, I much fear, by your Discourse and Principles, you exclude <hi>None:</hi> Nor ought you, so they heartily hold the same Gound of Faith with you; for then all their <hi>Vnchristian Tenets</hi> are to pass for <hi>Material Errours,</hi> not <hi>Formal He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies:</hi> They <hi>hold</hi> all true Faith in the <hi>Purse</hi> still, tho' they mistake the <hi>coyn</hi> and <hi>mettal;</hi> and that's enough, in all conscience, for such a Church as that you are about rearing or dawbing up. You pass a complement indeed upon the four first General Councils, and that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject <hi>all such Doctrins as were condemn'd</hi> by them; which use to be words of course in your Controversies; as [<hi>your humble servant</hi>] and such like, are in our common Conversation: but, when you are once got out of the circumstance of pretending to hold to some Antiquity, that so you may set a better face on it, when you oppose the <hi>Papists;</hi> when that job is over, they are but <hi>Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Congregations, and so perhaps were deceiv'd in all they defin'd against the <hi>Arians, Eutychians,</hi> &amp;c. Especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, if one of your <hi>sober Enquirers</hi> comes to fancy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; and, no doubt, there were many such even in
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44996:97"/>
those dayes. And, then comes the 21<hi>st.</hi> Article of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Symbol, and knocks them down all at once with a Declaration that their Decrees <hi>have neither Strength nor Authority, unless it may be declar'd, that they be taken out of Holy</hi> Scripture; and so all is with a turn of ones hand brought back to the same Point again, and, farewell Councils: Your self, and any one of your sober Enquirers, are at full liberty still to judge of <hi>them</hi> by your Scripture-Rule; and the Resolution of your Faith is establish't by that Article (at least as you make use of it) to be the same with that which is made, and profest by all the vile Hereticks in the world. For, as Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> sayes very candidly in his <hi>Answer to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of oonverting Protestants,</hi> p. 83. and, no doubt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Principles, <hi>If any man, after his strictest Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is still perswaded that a Council, has decreed against the true meaning of the</hi> Scriptures, <hi>in a point necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then he must prefer</hi> God <hi>to Man, and follow the Sounder tho' it should prove to be the lesser party: And, if any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or Synod of</hi> Protestants <hi>have decree'd any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this, in so far they have departed from the Protestant Principles.</hi>] Where we see he gives every sober Enquirer leave to judge of Councils, even tho' <hi>General</hi> ones, for he excepts None; and himself shews them the way, by Judging &amp; Censuring the Councils of his own Church.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Another scruple yet remains incumbent on you to clear; which is, that, by your putting it upon Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to prove you have not Absolute Certainty as to the Rule of your Faith, and by your innate Antipathy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Infallibility,</hi> 'tis very dubious whether your self do indeed hold the Tradition of all Christian Churches <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> even for the <hi>Scripture;</hi> however to save your Credit, you <hi>then</hi> pretended it, fearing your denying it might disedify Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Since then you ly under
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44996:98"/>
a shrewd suspicion, that you do not deal really with him, and the rest of your Readers, in this <hi>forc't</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; it would become you, in your Reply, both to shew <hi>why</hi> you allow that Testimony to be <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> and yet are such an Enemy to <hi>Infallibility</hi>; since common sense tells us, no man can judge himself <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> of a thing, if he judges he <hi>may</hi> at the same time <hi>be deceiv'd</hi> in it; and, withal, that you may give more satisfaction to your Readers herein, than an empty and scarce credible acknowledgment of it, when you were in untoward Circumstances; pray, go to work like a Schollar, and <hi>demonstrate</hi> to us by way of solid Reason, working upon the Nature of the Thing (for no Argument <hi>meerly probable</hi> will suffice to prove a Testimony <hi>Absolutely Certain) how,</hi> and <hi>by what vertue</hi> this <hi>Tradition of all Christian Churches</hi> comes to be thus <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> for the Letter of the Scripture; as you see we <hi>endeavour</hi> to <hi>demonstrate</hi> the <hi>Absolute Cettainty</hi> of <hi>our</hi> Tradition for Doctrin, There cannot be a worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Point to exert your self in, nor a greater service done to your <hi>Rule;</hi> nor a better way to clear your self to the incredulous part of the World, than to perform this: for one knows not whence meer <hi>Words,</hi> and outward <hi>Professions</hi> may proceed; but, solid and convincing Reasons can come onely from a <hi>Heart</hi> possest wiih the <hi>Truth</hi> of what is Profest. Go to work then, and bless us with the sight of this <hi>truly Learned</hi> and <hi>Iudicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance,</hi> And, while your hand is in, please to shew us too, that, the Absolute Certainty of this Universal Testimony reaches to prove your Rule <hi>Intire;</hi> that is, reaches to prove no part of the Written Word was lost: nay, that it reaches to the particular Verses, and the most substantial <hi>Words</hi> in those Verses, as well as to the main <hi>Books;</hi> and lastly, to Translations also and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44996:98"/>
as you ought to do in case they be (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are) of <hi>equal</hi> Concern, in our circumstances, as the <hi>Books</hi> themselves. Or, if you deny they are <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually important;</hi> and, maintain that this <hi>Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> may be had of your <hi>Rule,</hi> without the same Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty for <hi>these;</hi> then please to give us your Reasons for it, and shew how <hi>Faith</hi> can be <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> tho' the <hi>Letter</hi> on which it depends, may perhaps have been <hi>maim'd</hi> or <hi>corrupted</hi> by any of these miscarriages. Or, if you think fit to say you have Absolute Certainty of your <hi>Faith,</hi> tho' you have not Absolute Certainty for it's Rule; then, confess candidly and ingenuously your Faith is <hi>Absolutely-speaking Vncertain;</hi> and, to make good that rare Christian Tenet, fall to work and confute utterly that Positive Book [<hi>Faith Vindicated</hi>] which undertakes to produce a multitude of Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations to prove that <hi>Faith cannot possibly be false;</hi> and, withal, please to inform us to what end you maintain your <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith to be <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> if it do not make your Faith <hi>thus Certain</hi> too, or what that Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty serves for. Any thing would content us, so you would once leave fluttering, and hovering in common Words: Either tell us plainly all Faith is Uncertain, or come at length to some firm bottom, on which we may with <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> ground the <hi>Truth</hi> of it, and raise it above some plausible <hi>Likelihood.</hi> But, we remonstrate against your putting us off with the Old Sham [<hi>Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Certainty</hi>] unless you particularize to us what kind of Certainty you hold, and make out 'tis sufficient for the <hi>Nature,</hi> the <hi>Ends</hi> and <hi>Vses</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons issuing from it, and incumbent on the Prosessours of it. If you refuse to condescend to these fair Proposals, all the World must think you onely temporiz'd with Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and the occasion; and that you have not that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44996:99"/>
Zeal for your <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> (whose grand Interest 'tis these things should be made out) as you pretend. Once more I tell you, that, if all this will not move you to this every way necessary undertaking, I must then plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenge you, that it is your necessary and precise Duty, in this very circumstance, as you are a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertist; and, as I am concern'd with you under that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I must demand it of you.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. I know not well whether it be worth the while to justify Mr. <hi>M.</hi> for calling your Answer to Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s 5<hi>th.</hi> Question <hi>Trifling;</hi> or whether it be necessary, after so ample a Discovery, that all the rest of them, taking them in the sense you explicated them, deserv'd no better Character. You were ask't onely the meaning of your Words, [<hi>Christian Church</hi>] but you had a mind to be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral, and give more than was ask't, the meaning of [<hi>Vniversal Testimony</hi>] too: and to tell us, that, by <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Testimony,</hi> you mean <hi>Vniversal Consent.</hi> That is to say, by <hi>Vniversal Testimony,</hi> you mean <hi>Vniversal Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony:</hi> For, all agree or <hi>consent</hi> in the Testimony, if it be <hi>Vniversal.</hi> Then, to the precise Question, you An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that, by the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> you mean all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches;</hi> which is to say, that, by the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> you mean the <hi>Christian Church;</hi> for <hi>All</hi> the <hi>Parts</hi> make the <hi>Whole;</hi> so that, instead of an Explication, you give us the same thing over again, and almost in the same Words. And, pray, who's the wiser for such an Answer? Yet, tho' it be impertinent, and nothing to the purpose, 'tis at least <hi>True,</hi> and <hi>Evident by its self,</hi> without needing to make it a <hi>Question:</hi> If you would please to afford us such Evidences, when 'tis to purpose, you would highly oblige us. Certainly, a Considering Reader cannot but think you are very unhappy in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating your self; for, either your Explications run
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44996:99"/>
quite away from your Answer, which you are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate, and are a mile <hi>wide</hi> of them; or they come <hi>too close</hi> to them, and are the self-same said over again, and almost in the same Words. But, can any one think so excellent a Wit, as Yours, is justly reputed, should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose himself so manifestly, without some latent Design? Tis incredible: Let us take a view then of Mr. <hi>G</hi>'s 5<hi>th.</hi> Question; <hi>Being the Words</hi> Christian Church <hi>may be taken in several Latitudes by Persons of different Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I desire to know what that</hi> Christian Church <hi>is,</hi> &amp;c. Here we see plainly, that the main of the Question was, what Churches were accounted by You <hi>Christian,</hi> or how that Word [<hi>Christian</hi>] was to be explicated; and, You give him for explication the self-same word again, and in effect tell him, that by <hi>Christian</hi> is meant <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;</hi> and thats all he can get from You. And, You did prudently; for, had You come to distinguish which Congregation was <hi>Christian,</hi> which not, You must have secluded all <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which your Principles could not do; for your Ground of Faith here is most manifestly Common to <hi>all</hi> of them; and so You would have lain open to the Disrepute of having and <hi>professing</hi> a Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head with all those Excrementitious Out-casts; and your pretended Rule (notwithstanding its other many Divine Excellencies) had appear'd to be utterly unqualifi'd with Clearness and Firmness enough to be call'd a <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Ground.</hi> To avoid this, and in Consonancy to your Principles, You take all their Testimonies in for Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and pretend it <hi>strengthens</hi> it. So it may perhaps as to the <hi>Books:</hi> But, You know how the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of the Hereticks for corrupting the Letter of <hi>Scripture,</hi> to make it Favourable for them; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for any thing <hi>You</hi> know, they cry'd up the <hi>Books,</hi> because they had fitted them for their own purpose.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44996:100"/>
Whence, tho' the Testimony for the <hi>Books</hi> should be stronger by their <hi>concurrence,</hi> yet the Credit of the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the respective places that oppose those Hereticks, is <hi>weaker</hi> for their allowing them, because they admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them as consistent with their Tenets; otherwise, they would have rejected <hi>them,</hi> as they did <hi>others</hi> upon that score. And, what advantage can you gain by the former towards the proving your Ground of Faith Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely Certain, if you be not equally Certain of the later? Surely none at all: For, 'tis not the whole Book in <hi>the lump</hi> that can be produc't to <hi>prove Faith,</hi> or <hi>confute Heresy,</hi> but <hi>particular Texts;</hi> and, if These and the mainly significant <hi>Words</hi> in them, be not Absolutely Certain, what becomes of the <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> of your <hi>Rule,</hi> or your <hi>Faith</hi>? Nay, I am not fully satisfied that their <hi>concurrent Testimony</hi> does strengthen the Certainty of even so much as the <hi>Books.</hi> For, I observe that our Judges suspect the Testimony of honest men, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt the justness of the Cause, if known Knights of the Post are call'd in to <hi>corroborate</hi> their <hi>Evidence.</hi> But, you have prudent Maxims of your own which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of Lawyers.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. You endeavour to come a little closer to the Point p. 29. and set <hi>your self</hi> to prove that Scripture <hi>is</hi> your Rule of Faith; ay, that it is: In order to which, You advance this Proposition, <hi>that Certainly all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be the Word of</hi> GOD, <hi>must take it for a Rule of Faith.</hi> These two confident Words, [<hi>Certainly</hi>] and [<hi>Must</hi>] are very efficacious to perswade those who will take it upon your Word; nay they are so magisterial, that they impose a kind of necessity upon them of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving all <hi>is</hi> as you say, or else of denying your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which would break Friendship. But, if they will not, but happen to be so uncivil as to require <hi>Proofs</hi>
                     <pb n="77" facs="tcp:44996:100"/>
for it, they quite lose their force; and, which is worse, such positive Assertions make People expect very <hi>strong</hi> Arguments to Answer and make good such confident Affirmations; else it hazards Credit, to pretend Great Things and bring little or no <hi>Proof.</hi> How you will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify those big Words, we shall see shortly. In the mean time let us ask you, how you come to be thus <hi>Certain</hi> of it? Is there no more requisit to a <hi>Rule,</hi> but to be the <hi>Word of God?</hi> Or, did you never read in <hi>Errour non-plust,</hi> long ago, p. 73, 74, 75. the Answer now given You to this Pretence, in the Confutation of your 12<hi>th.</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; in which You endeavour to establish Scripture to be a <hi>Rule?</hi> Or, can You so much forget your self, and your duty to reply to it, as to discourse still thus crude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with the same confidence as if You had never read or heard of such a Book, or any thing alledg'd there to the contrary? If we must needs mind You of it so often, take these few words along with you now at least; and till you have reply'd to them, and others such which are there alledg'd, I beseech you let us be tir'd no more with such Talk, as serves onely to amuse, but can never edify or convince.

[What then Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is to do, <hi>is to produce conclusive Reasons to evince that the Letter of</hi> Scripture <hi>has</hi> such a Perspicuity, <hi>and other Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons belonging to</hi> such <hi>a Rule, as must Ground that</hi> most Firm, and Unalterable, <hi>and (if rightly Grounded)</hi> Inerra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Assent</hi> call'd <hi>Christian Faith.</hi>] We see here the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion rightly stated, and the Point that sticks; now let's see whether your Proof does so much as touch it, or in the least mention it.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. The Argument you make choice of, (I suppose it is your <hi>best,</hi> the matter in hand being of highest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence) to prove that all who <hi>believe Scripture to be the Word of God must take it for a Rule of Faith,</hi> is this. [<hi>For, since the reason of our believing is because God has reveal'd, whatever God has reveal'd must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, and a Book containing in it such Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons must be the Rule of our Faith.</hi> i. e. <hi>by it we are to judge what we are bound to believe as Divine Revelations.</hi>] What a wild medly is here, instead of a Reason! Here are four Propositions involv'd. The First, is this; <hi>the reason of our believing is because God has reveal'd</hi>; and this is granted: onely you may note that we are <hi>equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> bound to believe what God has reveal'd by the Church's <hi>Testimony</hi> as by <hi>Writing,</hi> if it be <hi>equally clear</hi> it was thus reveal'd; nay, more by the former than by the later, in case <hi>that</hi> way of ascertaining the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation be <hi>more clear</hi> than <hi>this</hi>: nor does your First Proposition deny this, but rather asserts it. The Second, This, [<hi>whatever God has reveal'd must be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd.</hi>] And this is pretended for an Inference, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, 'tis nothing less. For, how does it follow that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the reason of our believing is God's Revealing, therefore we are bound to believe what God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd, <hi>whether we know it or no?</hi> All then that can be
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44996:101"/>
said of it is, that 'tis pious Non-sense, unless you add to it that we have also <hi>Certain Grounds</hi> God <hi>has indeed</hi> reveal'd it: For, otherwise, besides the danger of <hi>err<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> our selves in matters of the highest moment (and this <hi>unalterably</hi> too, in regard we entertain that Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour as recommended by the Divine Revelation) we shall moreover hazard to entitle God's Infinit veracity to a Falsehood, and make <hi>Truth</hi> it self the Authour of <hi>Lies.</hi> The Third, that [<hi>a Book, containing in it such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations must be the Rule of our Faith</hi>] is absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd. For a Book may <hi>contain</hi> in it Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and I may not know certainly it does contain them: Or, I may <hi>know</hi> certainly by very good Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony it <hi>does contain</hi> them, yet not know certainly it does contain them <hi>all:</hi> Or, I may know it does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them <hi>all,</hi> yet perhaps not be able to know <hi>any one</hi> of those Divine Revelations in particular, which are <hi>contain'd</hi> there; for example, if it be in a language I understand not: Or, tho' I do understand the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, yet by reason of it's mysterious Sublimity, and deep Sense, and thence Obscurity and Ambiguity in many passages relating to spiritual matters, and the Chief Articles of our Christian Profession, I cannot be assur'd with Absolute Certainty <hi>which</hi> is the <hi>right Sense</hi> of it; and therefore (considering me as in the way to Faith, &amp; that my Assent depends necessarily on the Truth of some Preliminary which is the object of pure Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) I <hi>might</hi> not, nay <hi>cannot,</hi> with any true Reason, <hi>firmly assent</hi> to what I <hi>see</hi> may be an Errour; nor hazard my salvation upon an <hi>Vncertain</hi> Ground, and on which I know great multitudes have already Ship-wrackt. The Fourth [<hi>By it we are to judge what we are bound to believe as Divine Revelations</hi>) runs upon the same strain; for you are to shew us how <hi>by it</hi> I am to judge my
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44996:102"/>
self bound to believe <hi>any thing at all</hi> as a Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, that is, as taught by <hi>Christ,</hi> with a <hi>Firm</hi> and <hi>Vnalterable</hi> Assent, (such as <hi>Faith</hi> is) till I am <hi>Certain</hi> it is so, by being ascertain'd <hi>he</hi> taught it. This is the <hi>True,</hi> This is the Main Point; which you slide over still as smoothly as a non-plust Commentator does o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hard Texts, that puzzle him to explicate. I say once more, 'tis the <hi>Main</hi> if not <hi>onely Point:</hi> for, till you have made out this, you can never prove that Scripture (taken alone) is a <hi>Ground of Faith at all,</hi> much less an <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> Ground; and, least of all, <hi>your</hi> Ground in particular. And therefore you said very True when you lamented p. 28. you were <hi>in a hard case:</hi> for tho' (say you) <hi>there is an Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and this Certainty lies in Vniversal Tradition, and we can shew this Vniversal Tradition, yet we cannot shew the Ground of</hi> our <hi>Certainty.</hi> For, you cannot shew Universal Tradition for every particular Text that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns Faith without <hi>our</hi> Tradition-<hi>Rule</hi> for <hi>Doctrin;</hi> nor Absolute Certainty you have the true <hi>Sense,</hi> tho' you had <hi>that Certainty</hi> for the <hi>Letter,</hi> without which 'tis not <hi>your</hi> Ground at all. A Certainty there is, but not by vertue of <hi>your</hi> Grounds, and so 'tis none of <hi>your</hi> Certainty, nor <hi>your</hi> Ground neither. Whereas then you confess here that, <hi>if you cannot shew the true Ground of your Certainty you deserve to be either pity'd or begg'd,</hi> you say very true: for we do from our hearts pity you, let who will take the tother part. We pity you to see such excellent Wits, who, had they a good cause, would be honourably victorious, forc't by the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of a bad one to employ their Talents in shifting about for by-paths to avoid meeting the Question in the face. We pity you for your being necessitated to impose upon your well-meaning Readers with your
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44996:102"/>
specious pretences of <hi>Gods Word,</hi> instead of shewing them with Absolute Certainty (on your Grounds) that you have the true <hi>Sense</hi> of it in <hi>any one</hi> passage rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the controverted points; without which you cannot with Honesty pretend it <hi>Gods Word</hi> as to those Points. And, if that kind of <hi>begging</hi> may do you any good, we shall earnestly and heartily <hi>beg</hi> of God's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mercy to give you hearts to seek Truth, and candidly acknowledge it when found.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. I had almost forgot your <hi>Id est,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nects your Third and Last Proposition together [—<hi>must be the Rule of our Faith, Id est</hi> (say you) <hi>by it we are to judge what we are bound to believe as Divine Revelations.</hi> These <hi>Id est</hi>'s, which should be us'd to <hi>clear</hi> things, are still so made use of <hi>that</hi> they are the main Engines to <hi>confound</hi> them. Let your <hi>Id est</hi> then say what it please, I must tell you plainly, you quite mistake the meaning of the Word <hi>Rule</hi>; It speaks <hi>Rectitude,</hi> and that such an <hi>Evident</hi> one as preserves those who regulate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by it from obliquity or Deviation, that is, in our case, from <hi>Errour.</hi> You ought then to have said—<hi>The Rule of our Faith,</hi> Id est, <hi>by which, while we follow it, we shall be absolutely secur'd from erring</hi> in <hi>Faith,</hi> For the Primary Effect of a <hi>Rule</hi> is to give Faith that prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Quality</hi> as elevates it to the Dignity of <hi>such a kind</hi> of Assent, and raises it above that dwindling, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, alterable assent call'd <hi>Opinion.</hi> But you will needs, (to avoid coming neer so dangerous a Rock) take it for a kind of <hi>Quantitative Measure,</hi> nor for a <hi>Qualifying Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple:</hi> Whereas, indeed, 'tis not the <hi>What</hi> or <hi>how much</hi> we are to believe, which is now our Question; but, the <hi>That</hi> we ought to believe <hi>any thing at all;</hi> or <hi>That</hi> you can by your Grounds <hi>have any Faith at all</hi> for
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44996:103"/>
want of this Absolute Certainty, which you pretend to; 'Tis this I say, which is the true Subject of our present Debate. For tho' we both held the same <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> or <hi>Number</hi> of Points to a tittle, yet it might be <hi>Faith</hi> in one of us, and but <hi>Opinion</hi> in the other; nay perhaps <hi>Opinion</hi> in both, if both of us wanted Certain Grounds to evince they were <hi>Christs</hi> Doctrin, which is the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Motive of our Faith. It belongs then to a <hi>Rule</hi> to ascertain both the <hi>That</hi> we are to believe, and the <hi>What;</hi> but the former Office of it is Antecedent and <hi>Principal,</hi> the later Collateral, and Secondary: Common Sense telling us that we ought first to determin whether there is <hi>any Faith at all,</hi> e're we come to debate <hi>what Points</hi> are <hi>of Faith,</hi> what <hi>not.</hi> These Fast-and-Loose Doings make me, when ever I meet with an <hi>Id est,</hi> still expect it means [<hi>aliud est</hi>] and that, like your other Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your self, it is brought in to divert our Eyes to <hi>another</hi> Object instead of keeping them still fixt upon the <hi>same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="40">40. Enough has been said, I am sure too much ever to be Answer'd, to prove that Scripture alone as inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted by any Private Mans Judgment, wants the Chief Property of a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> viz. such a <hi>Clearness</hi> as is able to give all sorts of People, or the Generality of Christians (be they never so Sober Enquirers) Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Assurance of it's Sense, even in the highest Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Faith, <hi>without needing the Church's Help.</hi> Nor, will You ever be able to produce the Consent of all Christian Churches affirming that it has this Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Wherefore, when it is call'd a <hi>Rule</hi> by some of the Antients, it must be taken (as Mr. <hi>M.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>St.</hi> second Letter, <hi>p.</hi> 29.</note> sayes) with the Interpretation of the Church adjoyn'd; which, having the Living Sense of Christ's Law in her Heart, can ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the Dead Letter, and preserve it from Explications
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44996:103"/>
any way prejudicial to the Faith <hi>received.</hi> And, <hi>thus</hi> indeed, it may be call'd a Rule of Faith; because, as 'tis thus understood, it cannot lead any into Errour, but, <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Sect.</hi> 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note>is of good use to abett Truth by it's Divine Authority. In which sense Councils proceed upon it often, and sometimes call it a Rule. And, I remember the Famous <hi>Launoy,</hi> when we were Discoursing once about Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shew'd me a little Book of his, in which, he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prove, that Councils had frequently defin'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Hereticks out of Scripture. On which occasion I ask't him, if he judg'd those Councils fram'd their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions by the sense they had of the Letter by their own human Skill; or by the sense of the Church, which they had by Tradition: he answer'd, <hi>undoubtedly by the later;</hi> and that there would be no End of Disputing with Hereticks, had they taken the former Way. By which we may discern that still <hi>Tradition</hi> was in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per speech <hi>their Rule,</hi> even when they alledg'd Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Other, call Scripture sometimes a <hi>Rule,</hi> because it <hi>contains</hi> Faith; in which sense even some Catholicks call it a <hi>partial Rule</hi> because <hi>Part</hi> of Christ's Doctrin is <hi>contain'd</hi> in it, the other part descending by Tradition: which acceptation of the Word [<hi>Rule</hi>] is yet less Proper; because (as has been prov'd) it may be <hi>contain'd</hi> there, and yet we be never the neerer knowing our Faith meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by virtue of Scripture's containing it. But no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick ever said that <hi>every sober Enquirer may find out all necessary Points of Faith</hi> in Scripture <hi>without the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es Help.</hi> A Doctrin, which You declare p. 21. You <hi>are far from being asham'd of.</hi> And yet, let me tell You Sir, You will never find this Position of yours as it lies [<hi>without the Churches Help:</hi>] in the Universal Tradition <hi>of all</hi> Christian Churches; and, unless You find this, You will never prove they held it a <hi>Rule</hi> in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44996:104"/>
the genuin and proper signification in which we take that Word; (and tho' they shou'd call it a <hi>Rule,</hi> in either of the former Senses lately mention'd, they impugn not us at all, who grant the same.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. You will needs run out of the way, p. 30. to talk of a <hi>Iudge of Controversies;</hi> but the best is, You acknowledge you do go thus astray, by acknowledging <hi>'tis another distinct Controversy;</hi> and yet, tho' you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this, You still run on with it, that is, You still wander from the Point. You triumph mightily p. 31. that <hi>it is impossible for us to bring such an unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Consent of all Christian Churches for our Infallible Iudge</hi>—or <hi>our Infallibility,</hi> as Protestants <hi>bring for their Rule.</hi> As for the later, where were your thoughts, Sir, while you thus bad adieu to the plainest Rules of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course? Cannot we go about to <hi>demonstrate</hi> the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a <hi>Human</hi> Testimony by <hi>Natural</hi> Mediums, but, instead of Answering it, you must object against our Conclusion, and bid us bring the <hi>Consent of all Churches</hi> to abett that, which neither depends, nor is pretended to depend, on <hi>Authority,</hi> but on meer <hi>Reason?</hi> Cannot one say two and three make five, but he must be presently bobb'd in the mouth that he cannot shew the Consent of all Christian Churches for it; and that, unless he does this, let it be never so evident, 'tis not True? Tis very pleasant to reflect how brisk you are still with this <hi>Consent of all Churches;</hi> (I suppose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis a Topick very seldom heard of in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies) tho' as has been shewn over and over, 'tis not a jot to your purpose, nor avails any thing to the evincing <hi>you</hi> have an Absolutely-Certain <hi>Ground</hi> of <hi>your</hi> Faith. And, if we have an <hi>Infallible Rule,</hi> or such a Rule as permits not those to be deceiv'd that follow it, can there be any thing more Rational than to hold by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44996:104"/>
consequence, that there is an <hi>Infallible Iudge,</hi> or that our Church can judge unerringly in matters belonging to Faith? the word <hi>Iudge</hi> onely signifying that that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Persons, are <hi>in Authority,</hi> or are Authoritative <hi>Deciders,</hi> to preserve the Integrity of Faith, and the Peace of the Church. So that, supposing Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours or Bishops, and that those Sacred Concerns are to be provided for, plain <hi>Reason</hi> demonstrates to us this too as well as the other, without <hi>needing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all Christian Churches;</hi> tho' you need not to be told this does not want neither; unless you think that all the General Councils that defin'd against Hereticks, imagin'd they might perhaps be in an Errour all the while; and the Heretick, whom they condemn'd, in the right. Your <note n="*" place="margin">p. 3.</note>
                     <hi>Appeal to all the Churches of the Christian World</hi> for <hi>your</hi> Rule, has a plausible appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but vanishes into air when one comes to grasp it. How often must it be repeated that you have as yet produc't <hi>no</hi> Rule at all for <hi>your</hi> Faith? For you have neither prov'd that Scripture's <hi>Letter,</hi> as to every substantial <hi>word</hi> that concerns Faith, is <hi>absolutely-Certain</hi>; nor that it has in it the nature of a <hi>Rule;</hi> nor that, 'tis <hi>your</hi> Rule, more than 'tis to all the Hereticks in the world; nor that your <hi>Assent</hi> to any Point upon that <hi>Rule,</hi> as made use of by you, (for want of Connexion between the <hi>Points</hi> to be believ'd, and the <hi>Rule</hi> on which they are believ'd,) can have the nature of <hi>true Faith</hi> in it. If talking big would do the deed, you would indeed do wonders; but let your Reasons be proportionable; otherwise, <hi>strong words</hi> and <hi>faint</hi> blows are but very ill-matcht. Now, I must declare plainly I cannot see the least semblance of so much as one <hi>solid Proof</hi> in this whole Treatise of yours. If there be, confute me by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and maintaining it to be <hi>such.</hi> You explain
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44996:105"/>
you own Tenet over and over till one is weary of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it, and half asham'd so often to answer it. You talk much of <hi>God's Word;</hi> that we are <hi>bound to believe it, that it contains God's Will,</hi> and <hi>all things necessary to Salvation;</hi> and, twenty such fine things; which bear a Godly <hi>Sound,</hi> and would do well in a <hi>Sermon</hi> where all goes down glib, there being none to contradict you; but, are very dull and flat in <hi>Controversy.</hi> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, not one Argument have you even <hi>offer'd</hi> at, to prove you have <hi>Absolute Certainty of the Rule or Ground of your Faith,</hi> but have faln short in every one of those Considerations; both as to the Notions of <hi>Certainty, Ground, Rule, Faith;</hi> and that 'tis <hi>your</hi> Ground, <hi>your</hi> Rule, and <hi>your</hi> Faith.</p>

                  <p n="43">43. Of how different a Judgment the Primitive Church was, let a Chief Pillar of it, St. <hi>Athanasius</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us (<hi>Lib. de Synodis Arimini &amp; Seleuciae</hi>) where he blames some Clergy-men of his time for going about <hi>enquiring</hi> what they were to believe, in these words, <hi>Si credidissent, nunquam, quasi Fidem non haberent, de Fide quaesivissent.—Sese Infideles esse declaraverunt, cum id quaerant quod non habent.</hi> If they <hi>had believ'd, they had never enquir'd, as if they did want Faith.— They have declar'd themselves to be Vnbelievers by their enquiring after what they have not.</hi> So, that, it seems all your <hi>Sober Enquirers</hi> are (according to this Fathers Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) <hi>Infidels,</hi> or <hi>Vnbelievers.</hi> Observe here the vast distance between your Principles and those of this Holy Father and most learned Controvertist. Nothing but <hi>seeking</hi> and <hi>enquiry</hi> (with the Epithet of <hi>sober</hi> to grace it a little) will serve your turn; but, he tells us, on the quite contrary, that, if <hi>Wee seek,</hi> or <hi>enquire,</hi> we have <hi>no Faith at all</hi>: Which, in plain English, signifies thus much; you judge <hi>that</hi> to be the <hi>onely</hi> way to Faith, which, he judges a plain Argument of having <hi>none.</hi> You are all for <hi>seeking</hi> for your Faith in Scripture; He, for taking what is <hi>already found</hi> to our hand some other Way, w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi> must be by <hi>Tradition.</hi> One thing I should much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, did not I know your private-spirited Principles; 'tis this, why amongst other means you assign for your <hi>sober Enquirer</hi> to make use of, you do not put the <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Present Church</hi> (let it be your own if you
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44996:107"/>
please) for <hi>one</hi>? I should think the Faith of the Church had more weight in it, than all the rest put together, if you do indeed hold it a True Church; and 'tis far more <hi>easy</hi> to know its sense, where it has thought fit to expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it's self clearly. The finding the sense of <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatours,</hi> and the <hi>Places compar'd,</hi> and of <hi>Primitive Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> costs infinit trouble; whereas, there is no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to know the sense of the Present Church, speaking to you by Living Voice, and consonant Practise. I should think too, 'tis most agreeable to the Order of the World, the Unity of the Church, and the Maxims of Government (if you will allow any such to a <hi>Church</hi>) that People should follow the Doctrin of their Teachers, be led by their Pastours, and obey their Superiours; rather than be left to their own private Fancies, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of such Concern, that, if they clash with them in their Judgment, it hazards to break all those sacred Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by which the World subsists. Let me ask you one thing, ere we leave this Point. Is your <hi>sober Enquirer</hi> Bound to use these means for his satisfaction in <hi>doubtful</hi> Points, or not? You say expresly here, that, he is <hi>bound</hi> to do this; and, so I suppose you will be disatisfi'd with him, if he falls short of this Duty. I ask next, did Mr. <hi>T.</hi> use all these means in a <hi>doubtful</hi> Point, to compass a rational satisfaction? How should he, when he was sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd, and <hi>confirm'd,</hi> and <hi>resolv'd</hi> in so little time. Yet, for all your contrary Doctrin here, you are well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd with him, nay, you undertake <hi>p.</hi> 13. <hi>to satisfy the World that Mr.</hi> T. <hi>had sufficient Grounds for what he then said; which was, that, he was much more confirm'd in the Communion of our</hi> (the Protestant) <hi>Church, and resolv'd to continue in it,</hi> Pray, Sir, was he a <hi>sober Enquirer</hi> or no? If he was, did he in two hours time, that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> and you were Disputing, use the means you say your
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44996:107"/>
sober Enquirer is <hi>bound</hi> to make use of in <hi>doubtful</hi> cases; as <hi>his</hi> was, if he dealt sincerely with Mr. <hi>G.</hi> and did not play booty? Did he in two or three hours time, <hi>pray, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, compare Scripture, and Expositours upon it, use the help of spiritual Guides, &amp; the sense of the Primitive Church,</hi> which, are but <hi>some</hi> of the Means you prescribe p. 31. He made prodigious hast, if he did use those means: How comes he then to be so <hi>satisfi</hi>'d, nay, so <hi>resolv'd,</hi> without using those means; and so worthy of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage, if he did not what you say here, he was <hi>bound</hi> to do? These are Mysteries, which must be veil'd from the eyes of the Vulgar, &amp; Prophane. Nor is there any way to reconcile these Contradictions, but to understand you with this <hi>Clavis;</hi> that, you say any thing that seems to serve your turn, when you are disputing against us, and <hi>disclaim</hi> it again when the circumstance is alter'd; and that, as you pretended <hi>that</hi> for your <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> which not one in a thousand follow; so you pretend those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods must be taken, to understand your Rule right to the end we may not be deceiv'd by it, which, neither <hi>are</hi> taken by any, nay, <hi>need not</hi> be taken at all, tho' you told us here men were <hi>bound</hi> to take them; the believing your word that your Answer was competent (<note n="*" place="margin">See the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to Dr. St<hi>'s</hi> First Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Sect.</hi> 12.18, 30.</note> which was indeed <hi>none</hi>) acquitted his Obligation, and atton'd for his rashness. This, this alone, was so meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that, it was equivalent to <hi>Prayer, Meditation, comparing Scripture, and Expositours upon it, the help of spiritual Guides, and the sense of the Primitive Church,</hi> which, you declare here, such as he were <hi>bound</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult for their satisfaction in Faith. By which I guess your Test to distinguish a <hi>Sober</hi> from a <hi>Rash Enquirer,</hi> is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will rely on your Word or Skill for his security of Heaven. If he <hi>will,</hi> he is of your <hi>sober</hi> sort without more ado; and, need not trouble himself with those pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44996:108"/>
Methods: If he <hi>will not,</hi> he must go through them all, or be <hi>Rash.</hi> The Truth is, you play sure; and may safely defy any man living ever to <hi>enquire</hi> himself sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of your Communion: For, whoever begins, shall be sure to dy before he have <hi>enquir'd</hi> half way.</p>

At length, to my great Comfort (for 'tis tedious to find no Reasons to speak to, but still to be employ'd in confuting Mistakes) I am come to the last Task, that, as far as I can discern, will belong to my Province. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of <hi>pag.</hi> 31. your Discourse ayms to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish your kind of <hi>Iudgment of Discretion</hi>; which makes such a noise in your Books, and of late rings out of the Pulpit too.<note place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s famous Sermon Preach'd at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Cross,</hi> Feb. 23. 1686.</note> You make way to it thus, <hi>If we have the Consent of all Christian Churches against the onely pretended Infallible Iudge, we have their Consent likewise that every man is to judge for his own Salvation.</hi> Your Argument, such as it is, stands thus, <hi>By the Consent of all Christian Churches, there is no Infallible Iudge, therefore, every man must judge for himself.</hi> It seems then nothing will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent you now but <hi>Infallibility;</hi> and, if that be not to be had, every one may set up for himself in the <hi>Iudging</hi> Profession. Why, suppose the Governours of Our Church, when you left Her, or of your <hi>Own</hi> Church either, were <hi>Fallible;</hi> are you grown so nice on a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and your Conscience so tender in embracing any thing less than Infallibly-Certain, for Faith, that <hi>Falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> will not serve your turn, which hitherto, you so contentedly hugg'd and ador'd, and so wittily derided any Certainty above it? Suppose they had but your <hi>Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Certainty,</hi> or <hi>great Likelyhoods, fair Probabilities,</hi> or such like, for their Interpretations of Scripture; must they therefore lose their Power of <hi>Iudging</hi> in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, because they are Bishops?

You have such an a king tooth at the <hi>Churches</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddling in Faith-matters, no not so much as to <hi>help</hi> her Children in the most necessary Points (p. 21..) so they be <hi>doubtful,</hi> that neither profes't <hi>Infallibility</hi> nor acknowledg'd Fallibility will put you in good humour with <hi>Church</hi>-Governours; but out they must, and your <hi>sober Enquirer</hi> starts up in their stead. For <hi>he</hi> must judge whether they tell him right or no, when all's done; I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose by the light Scripture gives him, as he is to judge of the veracity of General Councils; and so we are got into the giddy whirl-pool of a <hi>Circle.</hi> He must learn the Sense of Scripture <hi>by them,</hi> and yet trust <hi>himself</hi> interpreting Scripture, not <hi>them,</hi> for the Sense of it? 'Tis pitty but he had a blew Apron on, and a Tub to hold forth in what heavenly light he had gain'd, by interpreting Scripture after the Method you have shewn him. Tis true, if there were no Absolute Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the way to Faith (and I believe you hold none in your Church) every man must shift for himself as well as he may; yet still even in that case, he is <hi>bound</hi> to do that which shall appear <hi>best,</hi> and come up as <hi>neer</hi> to Certainty as he <hi>can.</hi> And can he in any reason think his <hi>own</hi> Enquiry will bring him to more Certainty, than the Pastors of his Church, who had been <hi>sober Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> too themselves, and understood the Means you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to make that Enquiry, perhaps a thousand times bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than himself? If he thinks them <hi>better qualify'd</hi> than himself for interpreting Scripture, he sins against the Light of Reason, not to trust them <hi>rather</hi> than <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self:</hi> For they have, in that Supposition, more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge than he; Tis left then, that he is to judge <hi>himself</hi> to be better <hi>qualify'd</hi> than his Church, her Bishops and all his Pastors are for that work: and, upon this brisk self-conceit, the Book of Scripture flies open on a sudden,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44996:109"/>
discloses it's <hi>Sense,</hi> and discovers to him his <hi>Faith.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, such a man is likely to have a very Reverend esteem of his Church, her Bishops and Pastors; and yet, your Principles would have all men <hi>such.</hi> Indeed, you would have your sober Enquirers, <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>meditate.</hi> But, it should seem they are to <hi>pray,</hi> amongst other things, God would give them the <hi>Grace</hi> not to obey or believe their Pastors so much as themselves in <hi>necessary</hi> Points; (I hope you hold the Tenet of a Trinity, Christ's God-head, and such other Points, <hi>such</hi>) which otherwise their honest Natural Reason, conscious to it self of it's own Ignorance, will very much <hi>tempt</hi> them to do; and to <hi>meditate</hi> on God's great Mercy, in giving them great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Abilities and better Assistance than he does to his <hi>Church;</hi> for they are very ungrateful if they <hi>forget</hi> so signal and extravagant a Favour. But, let us see what is to be meant by an <hi>Infallible Iudge;</hi> for you do not particularize your acception of those words; nor let your Reader see <hi>what</hi> Judge, <hi>how,</hi> or <hi>for what reason</hi> we hold him <hi>Infallible.</hi>

If you mean by [<hi>Iudge</hi>] an Authoritative Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Controversies about Faith (as was said above) and that (which is what we hold) his verdict is <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi> by proceeding upon an <hi>Infallible Rule,</hi> you must either pretend the Christian Church never permitted Church-Governours to exercise their Authority in <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding</hi> matters of Faith; or else that it never held they had an <hi>Infallible Rule</hi> to go by. And I believe your utmost attempts will fall so far short of producing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such Consent of Universal Tradition for either, that it will be directly against you in both; and you must have a strange opinion of the Decrees of General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, in such cases, if you apprehend they held either of those self-condemning Tenets. And yet I cannot tell, but
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44996:109"/>
I have made my self too large a Promise concerning this Universal Consent of all Christian Churches being <hi>for us</hi> or <hi>not against us</hi> in this particular: For I remember now, that, when you were to state the Notion of <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> you took in the Consent of all former Hereticks to make your Tradition for Scripture <hi>larger</hi> and <hi>firmer</hi> than ours is against you, <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s First Letter, p. 7.</note>

                     <hi>and to make your Argument stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by their concurrent Testimony;</hi> and I see a glimmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light already, which will grow very clear ere long, you take in the same infamous Gang to bear witness against our Infallibility; And what a case is the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church in <hi>then?</hi> We can never expect those obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Revolters from that Church or those Churches which were then in Communion with <hi>Rome,</hi> will ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Governours had a <hi>just Authority</hi> to declare against them as Hereticks (for they were all of them, to a man, true-blew <hi>Sober Enquirers</hi>) or that those Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours proceeded upon an <hi>Infallible Rule;</hi> for this were to cut their own throats, and acknowledge themselves Hereticks; a mortification not to be submitted to by much contumacious spirits. Now all these by your Principles are to be accounted <hi>Christian Churches,</hi> and are call'd so very currently, and very frequently by you (p. 24. 25. 26. and in many other places) without any distinction at all. And so we are reduc'd to a very pretty condition, according to the admirable mould in which you have new-cast the Church. For, unless all those Hereticks of old, any <hi>Lutherans, Calvinists,</hi> and all the inferiour Subdivisions of Faith Reformers, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to give their <hi>concurrent Testimony</hi> to the Infallibility of the Roman Catholick Church (which condemn'd them all; and, as appears by the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> throughout, by the same <hi>Rule of Tradition</hi>) she is to have no Infallibility at all allow'd her; her old Rule too
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44996:110"/>
is condemn'd by them for a <hi>False Light,</hi> because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd them, and their <hi>New-Light;</hi> nor consequently can she be an Infallible <hi>Iudge</hi> in Faith-Controversies. This is a very hard Law; Yet your severe Discourses allow us no better quarter. You alledge that <hi>the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Churches utterly deny the Roman Churche's Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blely, tho' they be of very different denominations.</hi> You mean (I suppose) amongst the rest, the <hi>Nestorians, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychians,</hi> and such kind of good folks. And can you without blushing avail your self of such <hi>concurrent Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> against the Body communicating with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and her Infallible Rule, whose Ancestors were condemn'd by that very Body to which the present Roman-Catholick Church uninterruptedly succeeds; and were cast out of the Church for receding from the Christian Doctrine, held even then upon that very Rule?</p>
                  <p n="46">46. But what have we to do with any of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Christian Churches,</hi> whether <hi>Eastern,</hi> or <hi>not-Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern,</hi> Modern, or Antient; many or few? Or, what have you to do with them either, if you would, as becomes a Controvertist, speak home to <hi>us.</hi> You know already we place the Infallibility of our Church in delivering, defining and <hi>Iudging</hi> of Faith-Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, in the Absolutely Certain Rule of <hi>Tradition.</hi> All therefore that have adher'd to Tradition as their Rule, must allow to Her this Inerrableness, while she adheres to it, else they must condemn themselves. And those pretended Churches which have <hi>deserted</hi> Tradition, can never, for many reasons, be of any competent Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity against the Roman-Catholick. For, having <hi>no Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule,</hi> they can have <hi>no sure Ground</hi> of what they believe or alledge against her: And, besides, being her Enemies, and condemn'd by her, and that by vertue of
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44996:110"/>
this very Rule they carp at, common Equity tells every man 'tis not a pin matter what such men say of that Rule, or that Church either, whether those men live East, West, North, or South. I perceive by your far-stretcht words here p. 31.

While this Infallible Rule remains unconfuted, you must confess there may, and ought to be an <hi>Infallible Iudge;</hi> and your <hi>Iudgment of Discretion</hi> is convinced to be a meer Libertinage, forcibly granted to <hi>all,</hi> for want of Principles in your <hi>selves</hi> to <hi>Ground</hi> them certainly in their Faith, keep them <hi>steady</hi> in it, and <hi>reduce</hi> them to it when they deviate.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44996:111"/>
this <hi>Iudgment of Discretion,</hi> I will acquaint you how far and in what I allow it, how far and in what I reject it. I grant that <hi>every man is to judge for his own salvation,</hi> and to endeavour by his Reason to find the Way to right Faith. I grant with you that <hi>all Mankind agrees in it;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wonder at your self-contradiction to make <hi>us</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree to it, who certainly are <hi>some part</hi> of <hi>Mankind.</hi> I grant that, otherwise, <hi>'tis to no purpose to go about to make Converts:</hi> I add, nor for you, and me, to write Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies. I grant that <hi>every man is to judge of the best way to Salvation, and of all the Controversies between us and you; and especially of the true Grounds of Faith;</hi> and to be well satisfy'd who proceeds on a Certain Rule, who not; and that the contrary Tenet is as <hi>ridiculous</hi> as what's most, unless your putting upon us, against your daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, such a sottishness as to hold it. I add, that, since every man is to judge of his Grounds, therefore the Rule of Faith must be such as needs not much Learning and Reading, <note n="*" place="margin">Se Faith vind. p. 132, 133, 134, 135.</note>but must ly level to every man's Natural Light of Understanding; as the nature of Testifying Authority, and it's Certainty does. I will grant you moreover, that to deprive Mankind of this Priviledge of <hi>judging</hi> thus, is to debarr him of the Light and Use of his Reason, when 'tis most needful for him; that is, when it should direct him how to find out the way to his Eternal Happiness, and, avoid the paths that lead him to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Misery. But, I utterly deny, that therefore, he ought to think it <hi>Discretion</hi> to hammer out his Faith by the dints of his private and unelevated Reason, from Words that are of so deep, and mysterious a sense; and this, after he has experienced that multitudes of other men, as <hi>wise</hi> or wiser than himself, and (for ought he can discern) very <hi>sincere</hi> too, do their best to understand them right; and yet, as appears by their contradicting
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44996:112"/>
one another in matters of highest importance, one of those Great, and Learned Parties, does <hi>erre</hi> most dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously; I deny that his <hi>Discretion</hi> can lead him to <hi>judge</hi> that God's Providence has left no <hi>absolutely Certain</hi> Way to Faith, it being of so vast a Concern, and highest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity: Or that it can command him to <hi>Assent firmly</hi> and <hi>unalterably</hi> to any Tenet as a <hi>Truth,</hi> nay, profess it to be such, even with the laying down his Life to attest it; and yet that, notwithstanding, it may be a <hi>Lye,</hi> for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing can be known by the Grounds he goes upon. And, therefore, I deny that, in case Faith depends on some Authority bringing it from Christ (without Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of which none can be Certain 'tis <hi>True</hi> at all) that Authority should be <hi>Fallible</hi> in that affair, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps <hi>deceive him</hi> while he trusts it, or relies on it: Or, in case it depends on some <hi>other</hi> Means (<hi>viz.</hi> Scripture's <hi>Letter,</hi> and his own <hi>Interpretation</hi> of it) that Means should not <hi>certainly</hi> bring him to the End, if he makes use of it to the best of his power: I deny it to be <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion</hi> to think himself capable to <hi>judge</hi> he has <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> of the <hi>Intire</hi> Books of Scripture, even to such particular <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Verses</hi> he builds on, but by our Tradition for <hi>Doctrine;</hi> as likewise of their Translations and Transcriptions all along; and, of the Copies being taken at first from the true Original; whence I deny he can with true reason judge his Faith <hi>True;</hi> since a fault in any of these may make it <hi>False.</hi> I deny that he can with any Discretion <hi>judge</hi> that the ways you prescribe p. 31. for your <hi>Sober Enquirer</hi> to understand the Letter of Scripture right, and so come at true Faith, (viz. <hi>comparing Scripture and Expositours upon it, help of spiritual Guides</hi> (who confess they <hi>may</hi> all be <hi>deceiv d,</hi> and so may mislead him) and knowing the <hi>sense of the Primitive Church,</hi> &amp;c.) are the means left by God for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44996:112"/>
Men to arrive at Faith and Salvation; since to do this, he sees so many volumns must be read over, compar'd, and well-weigh'd, that in all likelihood, a hundred parts of Mankind for one (I may say a thousand) would Dy e're they could make a certain choyce which side to take in <hi>dubious</hi> points; and to add to his discomfort, those Points which of all other, are of highest concern, as are the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Christ's Godhead, the Real Presence of Christ's Body in the Sacrament, the Efficacy of God's Grace, and such like, are the <hi>most dubious;</hi> as being <hi>most controverted</hi> by the Pretenders to the <hi>Scripture-Rule.</hi> I deny he can with <hi>any Discretion,</hi> when he comes to receive satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Absolute Certainty of his Faith, suffer himself to be fobb'd off with telling him there is <hi>Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> of such a <hi>Book</hi> which <hi>contains</hi> it; when common Sense tells him he is as far as ever from having <hi>such</hi> a Certainty of his Faith, unless he has the <hi>same</hi> Certainty he interprets that Book right; and does not err pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously by misunderstanding the sense of it in those impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Articles: Especially, since your selves, tho' it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst your own Interest, are forc't to confess other Great and Learned Bodies had most grievously misunderstood its meaning, who had both the same Letter, and the same Means to look into it that he has, &amp; all that your Grounds afford him. I deny, he can with the least Discretion <hi>Judge</hi> it possible that all Christian Fathers could <hi>forget</hi> to day what they held yesterday; or that they should, if they remember'd it, <hi>knowingly resolve</hi> to damn themselves and Posterity, by teaching them a wrong Faith; or, that they <hi>could</hi> conspire to do so if they <hi>would;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that he ought not, if he acts discreetly, <hi>judge,</hi> that this Rule of <hi>Tradition</hi> is an absolutely, or infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly-Certain Conveyer of Christ's Faith down to Our Dayes. Whence, I deny that he can with the least grain
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44996:113"/>
of <hi>Discretion</hi> refuse to communicate with those who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on such an evidently Certain Rule, and are found in Possession of their Faith upon that secure Tenure; and adhere to those others who declare against any Infallible Rule; that is, who confess the means they have to know <hi>any</hi> one <hi>particular</hi> Point of Faith or (which is all one) <hi>any Faith at all, is Fallible;</hi> that their <hi>Guides</hi> may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps all <hi>mislead</hi> them, and their <hi>Rule</hi> permit the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of it to <hi>Err.</hi> You see now how we allow them the Use of their Reason, and Judgment of Discretion, till it brings them to find a <hi>Certain Authority;</hi> and, when they have once found <hi>That,</hi> the same <hi>Iudgment of Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which shew'd them that Authority was <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> obliges them to <hi>trust it,</hi> when it tells them what is Christ's Faith; without using their private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any longer, about the <hi>particular Points</hi> themselves, thus ascertain'd to them, but submitting to <hi>It.</hi> In doing which, yet, they do not at all <hi>relinquish</hi> their Reason, but, <hi>follow</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> it.

                  </p>
                  <p n="49">49. Now, let us consider the <hi>Iudgment of Discretion,</hi> as understood by you, of which your <hi>sober Enquirer</hi> makes use to find out his Faith. 'Tis onely employ'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout searching out the <hi>sense</hi> of Scripture's <hi>Letter</hi> by <hi>Fallible</hi> means; which he can never hope will preserve him Certainly from Errour, let him do his very best; since he is told, even by your selves, that Great Bodies of very Learned Men, and acute Scripturists do follow the same Rule, and yet erre in the highest Articles of our Belief; nay, he sees himself, by daily experience, how many Sects follow that for their Rule, yet vastly
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44996:113"/>
differ. Whence, instead of <hi>judging discreetly,</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the most absurd <hi>Indiscretion</hi> in the world, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his salvation upon his own <hi>Interpretation</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; when, at the same time, he is told by those very Men who propose to him this Rule, that there is no <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute</hi> security (neither by his own Industry, nor his Churche's veracity) from <hi>erring</hi> in that Interpretation. And, not onely this, but he sees or may see, if he will <hi>soberly enquire,</hi> what Certain Grounds are propos'd by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and yet suffers his Reason, and the Truth to be run down with the noisy hubbubs against Popery; and, either out of a blameable Weakness, or, perhaps out of an inexcusable obstinacy, rejects those Grounds, or disregards the looking into them. I say again, <hi>Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable:</hi> For, the very Nature of <hi>Faith</hi> tells him, that, 'tis an <hi>Vnalterable Assent,</hi> and, that it <hi>cannot possibly be a Ly;</hi> whence, common sense will tell him, 'tis not to be hoped for amongst those who confess that all the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they have of <hi>each</hi> particular Point of Faith, (that is of <hi>any</hi> Faith) is <hi>Fallible;</hi> and, onely likely to be had amongst those who <hi>own</hi> and <hi>maintain</hi> their Grounds <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deceive them;</hi> so that, such a man, if he ever came to a due Reflexion upon what most concerns him, sins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Light of Reason, in many regards; and, what you call <hi>Iudgment of Discretion</hi> is convinc't to be the most <hi>Vnjudicious Indiscretion</hi> imaginable: And, your <hi>sober Enquirer,</hi> who builds all his hopes of salvation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Iudgment,</hi> proves himself (the weight of the Concern being duly consider'd) to be the most rash and hair-brain'd <hi>Opiniastre,</hi> and the most credulously blind, that ever submitted and prostituted his Rational Faculty (with which God has endow'd him, and will require a strict account of him, how he has us'd it) to a most Groundless and Improbable Conjecture.

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>PErhaps the smart Expressions and plausible Methods that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> so affects in his late <hi>Discourse concerning the Nature and Grounds of the Certainty of Faith,</hi> in which he pretends to <hi>Answer</hi> the <hi>Catholick Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> may have rais'd Expectation in many indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent men, and Triumph in some of his Partial Admirers; wherefore, to stay the Appetites of the former, and give some check to the over-ween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the later: I thought it fitting to say somthing here by way of Preface, to give our Readers a short Account of his main Performances in that Discourse, till I come to publish a Compleat Answer to the whole. What I affirm of it, and undertake to make good, is;</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <hi>1.</hi> That he so strangely prevaricates from the whole business we are about, that he even forgets we are Writing <hi>Controversy;</hi> and would turn the <hi>Polemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<pb facs="tcp:44996:116"/>
Contest</hi> in which we are engag'd, into a Dispute of <hi>School-Divinity</hi>; bearing the Reader in hand, That we are Treating of Faith, as formally <hi>Divine,</hi> and of all the <hi>Intrinsical</hi> Requisites to it, as it is such; tho' none of them be Controverted between us, and some of them are perhaps onely Knowable by <hi>GOD</hi> himself. The meanest Reflecter may discern how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible 'tis for the Dr, My self, or any man living, to put such Particulars as these into our Proofs, or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; and how unpardonable an Absurdity 'tis to alledge them <hi>in our Circumstances.</hi> The very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (I say) of <hi>Controversy,</hi> obliges and restrains us both to speak of Faith precisely according to what is <hi>Controverted</hi> between the Contending Parties; and the nature of our present Contest, which is about an Absolutely-Certain <hi>Rule</hi> to know this matter of Fact, that <hi>Christ and his Apostles did Teach the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines we Profess,</hi> determines us both to speak of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Faith <hi>precisely as it stands under such a Rule,</hi> recommending our Faith to us, as deliver'd by <hi>Christ,</hi> and <hi>proving</hi> it to be <hi>his</hi> genuin Doctrin.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> That, whatever the Big Letters in his Title pretend, he neither shews from the <hi>Nature of Faith,</hi> as it lies under our Consideration, that it does not need the Perfect Certainty we require; nor that the <hi>Certainty</hi> he assignes to make us adhere to it as <hi>True,</hi> is not Perfect <hi>Uncertainty</hi>; since
<pb facs="tcp:44996:116"/>
he does not bottom it on the firm Ground of the things themselves without us, in which Creative Wisdome has imprinted all <hi>Truths;</hi> but, on our own aiery Apprehensions, or <hi>undoubting</hi> Perswasions; which must necessarily be <hi>Unsteady,</hi> when the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>those Things</hi> does not <hi>Fix</hi> them. Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly (which more closely touches our present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy) the <hi>Certainty</hi> he substitutes to that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc't by us, which excludes <hi>Deception,</hi> is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be manifested by <hi>Outward</hi> Arguments to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, being only his own <hi>Interiour</hi> Satisfaction or Opinion; which, as it is <hi>Invisible,</hi> so it may, in Disputes, be, with just reason; <hi>Rejected</hi> by any man at his pleasure.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> Whereas he pretends to lay <hi>Grounds for the Absolute C<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>tainty of Faith,</hi> he shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to shew he has laid any one <hi>Ground thus Certain</hi> (which is what he pretended) worthy the Name of a <hi>Ground,</hi> for the <hi>only</hi> Point in debate; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Christ and his Apostles taught thus</hi> or <hi>thus;</hi> but instead thereof, such feeble Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, as leave <hi>Christian</hi> Faith, whose <hi>Truth</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends necessarily upon the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Christ's Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing It,</hi> in the opprobrious and scandalous condition of being <hi>possibly</hi> (or <hi>perhaps</hi>) False. In a word, he was to shew the Absolute Certainty of his Grounds of Faith, and he so handles the matter, that one would
<pb facs="tcp:44996:117"/>
think, instead of <hi>shewing</hi> them, he were shewing there was no such Certainty <hi>Requisit,</hi> and so none <hi>needs</hi> to be shewn.</p>
                  <p>The rest of his <hi>Answer</hi> consists, generally, of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent Excursions, disingenuous Cavils, witty Avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances of any Rub that should hinder his Discourse from sliding on smoothly. His mistakes (whether Sincere or Affected the Reader is to judge) are numberless, his scornful jests frequent, and either meer Trifles, or built upon Chimaeraes of his own Invention. All which deliver'd in <hi>Poignant</hi> and Smart Language, give a pretty tang of Gayity and Briskness to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, and counterfeit a kind of liveliness of Reason; when as I dare avouch, and shall make it good, he has not one Single Argument that is <hi>Pertinent</hi> and <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> in the whole Course of his Answer. I pass by his <hi>Omissions,</hi> which are both very many, and most important; as likewise how he does not take his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries Discourse <hi>End-wayes,</hi> as I did <hi>His;</hi> nor gives the due force to his Arguments; but <hi>Skips</hi> up and down, here and there, Skimming off the <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial</hi> part of them by Playing upon his <hi>Words,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding the full <hi>Sense</hi>; that so he might make a more plausible mock-shew of an Answer. <hi>Lastly,</hi> his Evasions, as is the natural Progress of <hi>Non-plust Errour,</hi> are still <hi>worse and worse,</hi> and are <hi>Confuted</hi> by being <hi>Detected.</hi> 'Tis easy to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb facs="tcp:44996:117"/>
by his Expressions he is much Piqu'd and out of Humour; nor can I blame him; for 'tis too severe a Tryal of Patience, for a Man of his great Abilities and Authority, to be so closely prest to shew his Grounds why he Holds it <hi>True</hi> (or which is the same, <hi>Impossible to be False</hi>) That the Faith he pretends to, was indeed <hi>Christs</hi> Doctrine, and to find himself utterly unfurnish't with any means to perform it.</p>
                  <p>But I have reason to hope there will need no more to let the Reader see that all that <hi>Glisters</hi> in the Drs. Writtings is not <hi>Gold,</hi> but his carriage in this Sermon of his which I now come to examine; and to make him judge, that, if he hath dealt so delusively with his <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors</hi> when he spoke out of the Pulpit <hi>in God's Name,</hi> he will scarce behave himself more sincerely towards <hi>me,</hi> when he speaks <hi>in his own.</hi>

                     <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p n="1">§ 1. WHen Controversies are Preach't out of Pulpits, every Well-meaning Hearer is apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that what sounds thence is to be receiv'd as <hi>a Voice from Heaven:</hi> Too great a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage to be admitted by a Person concern'd, who judges he is able to shew 'tis but a <hi>false Eccho:</hi> especially, when he sees this forestalling the World by a Sermon, is a meer preparation to turn the Question quite off the Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and, withal, as the Preface intimates, to bring it from the handling <hi>one</hi> single Point, which bears all the rest along with it, to the debating of <hi>many</hi>; none of which can be <hi>decided,</hi> till <hi>That</hi> be first <hi>clear'd.</hi> Hence I esteem'd it not only a Justice to my self, but a Christian Duty to others, to Address my Defence to You, his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory; who (I fear) were led into Errours by many particulars in that Sermon, relating to our Controversy. I have reason to hope this Discourse will keep your Thoughts <hi>Impartial;</hi> which done, I will desire no other Umpire of our Contest, at present, but your selves.</p>
                  <p n="2">§. 2. It being the Chief and most Precise Duty of a Controvertist to secure the <hi>Truth</hi> of Christian Faith,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44996:119"/>
and this not being possible to be done, without proving it <hi>True</hi> That Christ or his Apostles taught it: hence, it has ever been my Endeavour to establish that Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Verity in the first place, by settling some Method that might secure it with a <hi>perfect</hi> or <hi>Absolute Certainty.</hi> Nature tells us, an <hi>End</hi> cannot be compassed without a a <hi>Means</hi> enabling us to attain it; whence, the first thing to be examin'd is, what that <hi>Means</hi> is, that is to give us this <hi>Certainty. Your</hi> common Reason assures you, that what's <hi>[True] cannot possibly be False;</hi> and the common Sentiment of all Christians, and the very Notion of <hi>Faith</hi> it self, has, I doubt not, imbu'd you with this apprehension, that your <hi>Faith cannot but be True;</hi> nor does any thing sound more harsh to a Christian Ear than to affirm that <hi>All Christian Faith may perhaps be but a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Story;</hi> which yet 'tis unavoidable it may be, if it <hi>may not be True</hi> that 'tis <hi>Christ's</hi> Doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="3">§. 3. You will wonder perhaps, when I acquaint you this is my greatest quarrel with Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and others of <hi>his</hi> Principles, that they make all Christian Faith <hi>possible to be False.</hi> Dr. <hi>Tillotson,</hi> with whom he agrees, and whose <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> he approves, maintains there, that there is no Absolute Security to be had from our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Deciev'd</hi> in judging we have the right <hi>Letter,</hi> or right <hi>Sense</hi> of the Holy Scripture, or that they were Writ by those Divinely-inspired Persons; but that, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the certainty we can have of those particulars, <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> p. 118.</note> 
                     <hi>It is possible all this may be otherwise.</hi> This I say, as appears by my Preface to the <hi>Second Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Letter,</hi> and by my Discourses quite through all the <hi>Three,</hi> is our Grand Contest, under which all our other differences subsume. But this Dr. <hi>St.</hi> was so pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to conceal from you, lest it should shock all his well-meaning Hearers; and I do assure you, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44996:119"/>
shall shew it, that, in those matters which he thought it expedient to let you know, he so misrepresents every thing, that he has both deluded You, injur'd the Truth, and quite dropt the Question. Whether he is to make satisfaction to <hi>Truth</hi> and to <hi>You,</hi> or <hi>I</hi> to <hi>Him,</hi> is to be determin'd by the <hi>Evidence</hi> I bring to make good my Charge. To State the Question then.</p>
                  <p n="4">§. 4. As to the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> my very Principles oblige me to declare that what I attribute to them, is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That they have <hi>All</hi> those Excellencies which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> yields them, and <hi>one more</hi> which he <hi>does not;</hi> of which hereafter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That they are <hi>Profitable</hi> to all the Ends St. <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Timothy</hi> ascribes to them; and that in such a high measure, that I do from my heart grant them to be so great an Instrument of our Salvation, that the Church had been at an incredible loss without them; &amp; that not near half the number of Christian Souls would have been sav'd, had it not pleas'd God to leave to the Church such a Powerful Means to instruct them in a virtuous life, and raise them up to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That, when they are animated with the Sense of the Divinely-Inspired Writers by a <hi>Certain Interpretation,</hi> they are very useful to confute Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; and that, <hi>Thus Interpreted,</hi> they are with much profit made use of, to that end, by Fathers and Councils.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That, tho' they were written on several oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, it was not without the <hi>Design</hi> of God's good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; which orders all our Actions to the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about his Best Ends, however they be <hi>occasional</hi> to us; much more an Affair so mainly important to the Churches improvement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That there was also a peculiar Providence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44996:120"/>
in preserving the Letter from any material Corruption; and, that the Second Causes by which this Providence exerted it self, was the most obligatory <hi>Care</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to whom those Sacred Oracles were committed, and the <hi>Knowledge</hi> she ever had of <hi>Christ's Doctrin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> That the <hi>Sense</hi> of Scripture is so <hi>sublime</hi> in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Points and high Mysteries of Faith, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Nature, and could only be known to the World by Divine Revelation, that no men by their Private Judgments, much less all sorts of men <hi>coming to Faith</hi> (and therefore unelevated and unenlighten'd by It) can arrive at the knowledge of it's Sense by the Letter in those difficult Texts, with such an unerring Certainty as is requisit for that most Firm, Rational and Unalterable Assent, call'd <hi>Faith;</hi> and, therefore, that in <hi>These,</hi> they need the <hi>Help of the Church:</hi> Whereas in other passages that are Historical, Moral, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the subject matter is more obvious to ordinary Reason, they are either clear of themselves, or may be clear'd, as much as is necessary, by the Learning of the more Knowing Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. For the same reason I hold, that Scripture, thus <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately interpreted,</hi> is not convictive of Hereticks, who have imbib'd a contrary sentiment to that of the Divine Enditer; because those men admit no <hi>Certain Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of those difficult places. And, this want of <hi>Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> in such Texts, I do not take to be a <hi>Privative Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection;</hi> but, on the contrary, to argue a very <hi>high Perfection</hi> in Scripture; <hi>viz.</hi> as <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis</hi> has told us 1200 years ago, <hi>Commonitor,</hi> cap. 2. It's <hi>Deep Sense;</hi> Whence 'tis rather to be call'd properly, a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion of that <hi>Sense</hi> to the low Conceptions of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Iudgments</hi> looking after Faith; or an Obscurity, <hi>relatively</hi> to such Persons, than an <hi>Absolute</hi> one: since the Faithful, who are instructed in that Sense, are both
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44996:120"/>
capable to understand it right, and moreover to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover still more and more Excellent Truths in it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7<hi>thly,</hi> That for this reason, I cannot hold the Letter of Scripture privately interpreted the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> or a Means for people of every capacity, looking after Faith, to know the <hi>Sense</hi> of it in those Dogmatical Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; with <hi>such</hi> a <hi>Certainty,</hi> as was shewn <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> above to be Necessary for a Ground of <hi>Faith;</hi> nor can I allow that the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Christian Faith</hi> ought to be built upon such a Sandy Foundation as are those <hi>Private Interpretations.</hi> And, therefore, that there needs some other Rule to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain people of all sorts what is Christ's true Doctrin <hi>in those points.</hi> Moreover, I make account the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of all Ages since Christ's time abets my Position. Every Heretick, and all his Followers, relying on his <hi>private Interpretations</hi> of Scripture for his wicked Blasphemies; as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do <hi>now,</hi> who are (as far as we can discern) <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>exact</hi> Followers of that <hi>Rule,</hi> or <hi>Vsers</hi> of that <hi>Means;</hi> and yet, fall short of Christ's genuin Doctrine, denying his <hi>Godhead,</hi> and the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the B. <hi>Trinity</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A plain Argument that <hi>That</hi> cannot be the way to <hi>Truth,</hi> which such vast multitudes have follow'd, and yet have been led into Errour, unless we <hi>knew</hi> them all to be <hi>wilfully sincere,</hi> or <hi>strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly negligent;</hi> which we can neither <hi>know,</hi> nor have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to <hi>think.</hi> And, as experience has shewn this to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans eye, so neither is it my sentiment onely. The same <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>Lirinensis</hi> telling us, That by reason of <hi>the Scripture's Depth, as many Opinions as there are Men seem possible to be drawn thence.</hi> Where he ascribes the obscurity of the Letter not meerly to the fault of the Persons, nor the hardness of the <hi>Words,</hi> in which the Sense is deliver'd, but to the <hi>Profoundness</hi> of the <hi>Sense</hi> it self; Reason and Experience both informing us, that,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44996:121"/>
where the matter is above the Readers capacity, tho' the <hi>Words</hi> be never so <hi>plain,</hi> yet the Doctrine is not easily comprehended without some who is already skill'd in that Sense.</p>
                  <p n="5">§. 5. As for <hi>Tradition;</hi> The very sound of the Word may perhaps give you some prejudice against it, because our Saviour reprehended the Jews for some un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable <hi>Traditions</hi> of theirs. This obliges me to give you a true Character of our Tenet concerning It, and to make known to you particularly what [<hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>] means, as we understand it in our Controversies; which Dr. <hi>St.</hi> (tho' he knows it) will never do; but, on the contrary, (as shall be seen) misrepresents it all along very disingenuously in every particular. What we hold of it then, is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That the Apostles, by their <hi>Preaching</hi> during the whole time of their lives, settled the self-same Christian Doctrin in the minds of the Generality of the Faithful, dispersed in several Countries; and not only at <hi>large</hi> and <hi>particularly</hi> explicated it, and <hi>fixt</hi> it by their heavenly <hi>Preaching,</hi> but <hi>riveted</hi> it (as we may say) by <hi>Miracles;</hi> founded Churches, and constituted Disciplin; by means of which, and their own Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they establish't them in the <hi>Practice</hi> of that Doctrin. Lastly, They recommended the continuing it as the means of Salvation; and, consequently, that the swerving from it themselves, or neglecting to educate their Children in it, was the assured way to Eternal misery to them and their Posterity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That this <hi>vast multitude</hi> unanimously settled in the same Faith is that which we make the <hi>First Source of Tradition;</hi> which had no more to do but to <hi>attest</hi> to the <hi>next</hi> Age what the <hi>First</hi> had <hi>receiv'd</hi> and <hi>practis'd;</hi> nor could they <hi>forget</hi> a Doctrin which was <hi>so</hi> recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44996:121"/>
and according to which they had <hi>led</hi> their Christian <hi>lives</hi> so long: Nor could true <hi>Faith</hi> (the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of all other Virtues) which was in their hearts, no nor even the <hi>Natural love</hi> to themselves and their Children, permit them <hi>all</hi> to be so <hi>Wicked</hi> as to decline from it voluntarily, or neglect to educate the others in it; however, it was to be expected there would be now and then a <hi>failure</hi> in some <hi>Particulars,</hi> deserting the former Doctrin, and drawing Proselytes after them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> That, the <hi>same</hi> reason holds for the <hi>Continuate Delivery</hi> of the <hi>same</hi> Doctrin by the <hi>Second</hi> Age to the <hi>Third,</hi> and so still forwards; the most powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives God himself could propose being laid to oblige Christians not to deviate from it in the least, or be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to recommend it. And those Motives too a thousand times more lively imprinted and apprehended by the heaven-instructed Faithful, than they were by any in the <hi>former</hi> Ages of the World, <hi>before Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4thly, That by [<hi>Tradition</hi>] then is meant, <hi>The Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the whole foregoing Age of Christians to the next Age, of what had been deliver'd, and explain'd to them by their Living Voice and Practice.</hi> Or, taking <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> (as it ought to be) for <hi>Oral</hi> and <hi>Practical</hi> both, 'Tis, <hi>A Continu'd Education of undergrowing Posterity in the Principles and Practice of their Immediate Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> That hence 'tis Evident beyond needing Proof, that <hi>this Rule cannot</hi> (on it's part) <hi>deceive us.</hi> For, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that it was <hi>still follow'd,</hi> or, that Posterity still <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev d</hi> and <hi>practis'd</hi> as their Immediate Fore-Fathers <hi>did,</hi> who at first believ'd and practis'd as the Apostles had instructed them; 'tis manifest the Last Age of the World must have the same Faith that the First Age of Christianity had. Whence follows evidently that no
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44996:122"/>
Errour could possibly come in at any time unless this Rule of <hi>Tradition</hi> had been deserted.</p>
                  <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> That <hi>Tradition,</hi> thus understood, (and we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver understood it otherwise) being the Living Voice and Practice of the Church in the immediate Age before, is applicable to all even of the lowest Capacity; as we experience, to some degree, in the instructions by Past<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours even now adays. And, since it delivers it's <hi>Sense</hi> (which, in those that have follow'd that Rule, has been even now shewn to be Christ's Doctrin) by <hi>Preaching<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Catechizing, Explaining,</hi> daily <hi>Practising,</hi> and all the ways imaginable to make it understood, 'tis also an <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely-Clear</hi> Conveyer of Christ's Doctrin downwards. Add that, should it's sense be at any time <hi>misapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> the Church and her Pastours can <hi>explain</hi> their own meaning, <hi>pertinently</hi> to the Askers, Doubter's or Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker's Exigencies; which a Letter in a Book <hi>cannot.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7<hi>thly,</hi> That the Chief Care of the Church was to inculcate to the Faithful, and preserve inviolate the <hi>Chief Points</hi> of the Christian Faith; and, therefore, that <hi>Tradition</hi> did most particularly exert it's self in Teaching and Transmitting <hi>Those.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8<hi>thly,</hi> 'Tis not to be deny'd but <hi>Scriptural Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> went along with this other we have explain'd. For the Church having the <hi>same sense</hi> in her breast which the First Writers had, were, consequently, the <hi>best In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters</hi> of it; which was <hi>one</hi> Reason why the Fathers and Councils often made use of it to <hi>confute</hi> Hereticks, and <hi>comfort</hi> the Faithful by it's <hi>concurrence.</hi> But, when they were to <hi>convert</hi> any to Faith, it was never heard, they took such a Method as to put the Bible in his hand, and bid him look for his Faith there; telling him 'twas Plain even in the highest points, that were <hi>dubious</hi> or Controverted, to every capacity.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:44996:122"/>9<hi>thly,</hi> That, hence, Scripture, <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Letter, p. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>without the Churches help,</hi> was never held by <hi>them Anciently,</hi> nor can with reason be held by <hi>us now</hi> to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> in the sense we use that word; that is, to be a <hi>Means</hi> or <hi>Way</hi> for All who are <hi>coming to Faith,</hi> to arrive <hi>unerringly</hi> at it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> we hold that the Sense of Scripture's Letter, in those sublime Points, <hi>surpasses</hi> the apprehensions of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men <hi>coming to Faith;</hi> and, so, the Letter alone can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an assured Ground to build the Truth of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith upon: whence follows that <hi>Tradition</hi> (which is Plain and Easy) and only <hi>It,</hi> can be in Proper Speech <hi>the Rule of Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">§. 6. <hi>This</hi> then is the true State of the Question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us. <hi>This</hi> is our true Tenet, both concerning <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> and <hi>what</hi> are the Points to be ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by them. Now, let us see how the Sermon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents us, and whether your admired Preacher does so much as <hi>touch</hi> any one of these particulars.</p>
                  <p n="7">§. 7. In the first place you may please to take notice that he never lets you know, or so much as suspect that the main Contest between <hi>him</hi> and <hi>me</hi> is about the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Certainty,</hi> or <hi>Uncertainty</hi> of <hi>Christian Faith,</hi> His wicked Doctrin, in that Point, oblig'd me to write a <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Faith vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi>

                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:44996:123"/>§. 8. First, he talks of a <hi>Stedfastness, and a firm and well-settled resolution to adhere to that Faith which Christ himself deliver'd.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 1.</note> But, ought you not to be assur'd first that he did <hi>indeed</hi> deliver it? Or are you to adhere to it as <hi>his,</hi> whether you are certain 'tis <hi>his</hi> or <hi>no?</hi> Or is a <hi>resolution,</hi> to hold <hi>stedfastly</hi> to what you judge <hi>is</hi> the Faith of Christ, <hi>well-settled,</hi> if that Faith of yours, the <hi>Basis</hi> of your Spiritual Building and <hi>Ground</hi> of that Resolution, be not <hi>well-settled</hi> it self, but <hi>may</hi> sink into <hi>False-hood?</hi> This is the true Point you are to look after; and, till you have perfect satisfaction from him in this, wisely to consider, that <hi>Pious Talk</hi> without <hi>Solid Grounds</hi> to support their <hi>Truth,</hi> is but painting the out-side of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher. The tinkling cymball of a little Rhetorick, and shews of much Reading, may go far with persons whom such flourishes can prevail upon to forgo their Reason; but he had but a very small respect for you, if he hop't you were so easy to be play'd upon with the wind of a little articulate ayr.</p>

If the Later, the Tradition was not faulty, but <hi>They</hi> who Deserted it; Yet, how different soever these two Points are, the one making <hi>for</hi> that particular Tradition, the other <hi>against</hi> it, he never thinks of distinguishing them, or letting the Reader know when the <hi>Tradition</hi> was in fault, and when the <hi>Persons;</hi> but runs on in common words, as if he had no Design, or determinate prospect whither he was going.

But, tho' all his Reflexions from the several pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture are quite besides the purpose, yet his Candid and Solid way of managing his own Mistakes, and how he wire-draws every thing to make it seem fit, deserves our particular observation.

Doctrin. But, this mountainous Expectation came off with a poor little mouse, the relation of one single man, <hi>Papias,</hi> of what an Apostle had told him; which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good honest Soul, gain'd credit with diverse. Tho', as for his wit, Dr. <hi>St's</hi> Author, <hi>Eusebius,</hi> tells us <hi>he was a man of a mean capacity,</hi> and scarce <hi>understood the meaning of what was spoken,</hi> I wonder the Dr. blush't not to put such a Slur upon his Auditory, as to compare the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority of the whole Christian World, and the Universal Testimony of God's Church, to the private story of <hi>one weak</hi> man; or to pretend hence that if <hi>he</hi> were mistaken, the <hi>Authority</hi> of <hi>Tradition mightily sinks</hi> and <hi>fails;</hi> whereas 'tis only his own Credit that falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that disaster by making such a senseless Argument. Yet, this is the best, and, as far as I can find, the only one he has brought to prove directly the First Age of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians had bely'd Christ's Doctrin to the Second; and that because one man of a <hi>mean Capacity mistook,</hi> we may stand in doubt of our <hi>Assurance</hi> whether all the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neder Faithfull, nay all the Pastours and Bishops in the Church, had <hi>Capacity</hi> enough to <hi>know</hi> an open matter of <hi>Fact, viz.</hi> what had been taught and practis'd publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every day by a World of Fore-fathers, or the <hi>Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> not to <hi>deceive</hi> us.</p>
                  <p n="15">§. 15. Of the same stamp is his alledging that St. <hi>Luke</hi>'s reason why he writ his Gospel,<note place="margin">P. 14.</note> was to give <hi>Theophilus Certainty of those things wherein he had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.</hi> The Subject of our Enquiry is about the High Points of Christian Belief: Does the Dr. think then that <hi>Theophilus</hi> was not a <hi>Christian,</hi> or had no Certain Knowledg of his Faith, ere St. <hi>Luke</hi> writ?

his Gospel) could make him know it <hi>better,</hi> and with more <hi>Certainty</hi> than their <hi>Preaching</hi> it <hi>at large?</hi> With what Sense can any of this be pretended? The Apostles did Miracles to attest their Doctrin: Did St. <hi>Luke,</hi> do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to attest the True Sense of all he writ in those Points? Again, what did his <hi>Gospel</hi> contain? Only those Dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Points controverted from time to time between the Sons of the Church, and her Deserters; of which, and none but which, we speak? Alas! these are the <hi>least part</hi> of his Gospel, and make but a small appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in it. He relates our Saviour's Genealogy, Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Fasting, Miracles, Parables, his sending his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and Disciples, his Exhortations to Repentance and good Life, the Manner of his Entring into <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> his Instituting the Last Supper, the particulars of his being apprehended, accus'd, condemn'd, and Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify'd. Lastly, his Burial, Resurrection, Apparitions and Ascension. These are laid out in that Gospel <hi>at large,</hi> together with many excellent sayings of our Blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour related <hi>verbatim.</hi> And <hi>These,</hi> as they were never pretended by us to be the Object of Tradition; so, tho' spoken of frequently (and perhaps variously) amongst Christians, were Impossible ever to be perfectly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd by the Generality, unless put in a <hi>Book;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives <hi>Theophilus</hi> (and others) the <hi>Certain</hi> and particular knowledge of all <hi>these Passages</hi> by <hi>Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> And Dr. <hi>St.</hi> confesses the same (p. 17.) and that his aym and Intention was <hi>to give an Account of the Life and Actions of Christ,</hi> but not a word that his Writing was to give <hi>Theophilus Certainty</hi> or a <hi>Clearer Knowledge</hi> of those Main Articles, to ascertain which <hi>Tradition</hi> is pretended by us to be the most proper Means.</p>
                  <p n="16">§. 16. Now let's see how many notorious prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and faults he has fallen into in this one Instance.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44996:126"/>
1. Our whole Controversy is about the Certainty of those sublime Points of Christian Faith; which he conceals, and confounds them with a multitude of <hi>particular</hi> Passages. 2. He intimates our <hi>Tradition</hi> is to ascertain all that's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in St. <hi>Luke's</hi> Gospel. Whereas, he knows well, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon no Tradition but whats in some degree <hi>Practical,</hi> which those Particulars are not; unless it be those, of which we keep Anniversary Solemnities. 3. He is so angry at <hi>Tradition,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">pag. 15.</note> that he pretends the very <hi>Oral Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Preaching</hi> of the Gospel by the Apostles, needed <hi>something to strengthen and confirm it.</hi> Lastly, he makes our Tradition to begin with the <hi>first Preaching of the Apostles;</hi> whereas, it dates it's Original from the <hi>first Age of Christianity</hi>; already perfectly instructed by them, during all their Lives, and settled into Ecclesiastical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Discipline at their Decease.</p>
                  <p n="17">§. 17. He seems at length to come neerer the Point, and affirms, <hi>That the Writings of the Apostles, when Matters of Doctrin came to be contested,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">pag. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>were the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rule whereby they were to judge which was the true and genuin Doctrin of</hi> Christ; and, which is yet better, that <hi>They were intended by the Holy Ghost, to be a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule, whereby the Church was to judge which was the true and genuin Doctrine of</hi> Christ. I am glad with all my heart, to hear him speak of the <hi>Church</hi> being a Judge of <hi>Controversies;</hi> or, that he allows Her any hand in <hi>ascertaining</hi> and <hi>proposing</hi> Faith. I ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood him hitherto, That <hi>every sober Enquirer</hi> was to judge of the sense of Scripture for <hi>himself;</hi> That it was <hi>plain</hi> to him even in the highest Points; and, that if, in any contested or <hi>dubious</hi> Articles, the Letter of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture did not declare it <hi>explicitly,</hi> his sober Enquirer could <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s Answer to the Catholic Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>p.</hi> 71</note> by <hi>parity</hi> of <hi>Reason</hi> render any <hi>Implicit</hi> Point <hi>Explicit,</hi>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44996:127"/>
the most difficult Task as to the penetrating the Sense of Scripture that is possible, and far beyond the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what's there <hi>Explicitly.</hi> He told us too in his <hi>second Letter,</hi> p. 31, 32. <hi>that, because there is no Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Iudge — every man is to Iudge for himself;</hi> and this by Scripture, his <hi>Rule.</hi> But, here the case is alter'd, and the <hi>Church</hi> is to <hi>judge of Christ</hi>'s <hi>Doctrin by Scripture.</hi> I can allow honest Retractions without upbraiding them; and am contented that the Church should judge by Scripture, both when She is to Edify Her Children, and in <hi>contests</hi> with Hereticks, as to all those Points contain'd there; and, I think the only difficulty in that particular is, <hi>By what means</hi> She came to be <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely-Certain</hi> of it's <hi>Sense.</hi> Let him add then but <hi>one</hi> word more, and say that <hi>by</hi> the Letter of Scripture She so judg'd of Faith, that She <hi>could not</hi> be in an Errour, or mistaken all the while, and then <hi>Christian Faith</hi> is <hi>Absolutely-Certain,</hi> and my greatest care is over. And, if he does not <hi>That,</hi> what is the future Church, after the Apostles Deaths, the <hi>better</hi> for Scripture's being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Rule, if She and Her Children <hi>partake</hi> not the Benefit of that Infallibility some way or other, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perfectly secur'd from Erring in Faith? Is it not all one as to the intent of knowing assuredly we have the Faith taught by Christ, whether we have an Infallible Rule or no, if, when we have done our best, we may still stray from Her Faith? Or, why is not a Rule that is not <hi>Absolutely-Certain,</hi> so I have Absolute Certainty I am directed by it, as good for that purpose, as an Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely-Certain Rule with no Absolute Certainty that I do indeed go according to it. To speak to his proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Whether the Church and the Faithful in <hi>Contests with Hereticks</hi> avail'd Her self of Scripture's Letter, to gain Absolute-Certainty of it's Sense, in those main Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets; or <hi>brought</hi> the Sense (which She had another

way) <hi>along with her,</hi> shall be decided if he pleases, by St. <hi>Austin,</hi> whom he cites here, <hi>p.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p n="18">§. 18. He will prove <hi>Scripture</hi> a <hi>Rule</hi> from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reason of it's Writing;<note place="margin">See p. 15.</note> and prove <hi>this</hi> general Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from a Testimony of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> which speaks of the Gospel as abstracted from being <hi>Preach't</hi> and <hi>Written</hi>; and who doubts but as such it is infallibly true. He seems to build much upon the Words [<hi>That it might be a Foundation and Pillar of our Faith.</hi>] Be it what it will in it self, the Point is, How does it Build Faith <hi>in us?</hi> By it's meer <hi>Letter,</hi> descanted upon by <hi>private Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> or, interpreted by the Church? The Later he denies; the Former, all our most earnest Pressing and Intreating could never bring him, nor his Reflecter to go about to make out; and he wayes it totally through this whole Sermon. Let him then but shew that he has Absolute-Certainty of Scripture's Sense, in those Tenets of Christian-Faith, by any Method his Principles will allow him, and his Sermon should have past for me without Controul. <hi>That's</hi> the main Point, whereas all here is quite <hi>besides</hi> it. As for those Words from <hi>S.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44996:130"/>
Scripture might in that Supposition be a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> as to the Points contained in it; and that there would be no need of the Church for our <hi>simply believing,</hi> but only to <hi>confirm</hi> our Faith, <hi>explain</hi> it more throughly, when any part of it, imply'd in some main Point, is deny'd; apply it to our Consciences by her <hi>Preaching,</hi> and keep us up to the Doctrin it delivers by her Government and Discipline.

Whence, for the same Reason, if there were any deviation from the <hi>Christian Doctrin,</hi> which, as contradistinguish't to that other, was <hi>writ in the</hi> Living <hi>Tables of the Hearts</hi> of the Faithful, the best Way of preserving or restoring <hi>That,</hi> was by the <hi>Sence</hi> writ in the <hi>Heart</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> at first by the Preaching of the Apostles, and continu'd ever since, in the manner we have describ'd and prov'd.</p>

presume to penetrate the Meaning of the Scripture in Texts of so <hi>deep</hi> a Sense as those <hi>Mysteries are,</hi> because the Jews were exhorted to do it, in a matter <hi>within</hi> the Sphere of their Capacity?

And did ever any of us pretend, that <hi>Tradition</hi> was to bring down such <hi>particulars?</hi> If he says we did, he must shew <hi>where!</hi> If he confesses we <hi>did not,</hi> he must confess withal, his Text and Discourse here is nothing to the purpose. He turns it off from the Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of <hi>searching the Scriptures</hi> to know the true <hi>Messias,</hi> to the knowing whether he were a <hi>Temporal Prince</hi>; whereas the Tradition of his Kingdom's being purely <hi>Spiritual,</hi> was neither <hi>Vniversally</hi> held, taught, nor deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd at first by the First Founders of that Law, nor settled in the hearts of the Synagogue, or the Universality of the Jews in the beginning, as Christ's Doctrin was by the unanimous Preaching of the Apostles in the hearts of such a numerous Multitude as was the Christian Church of the First Age. Which being evidently so, What rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was there our Saviour should refer them to such a <hi>slight,</hi> or rather <hi>no-Tradition,</hi> and not to the <hi>Written</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, in which he was foretold? Or, What conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can be drawn hence to the prejudice of <hi>Christian</hi> Tradition, which, and which only, we defend; and which (as was fitting) is so strongly supported, that it is impossible to find a Parallel to equal or come nigh it. And unless this be done, all his Arguments against it stand thus, <hi>A Lesser Force cannot do an Effect, therefore a Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot.</hi> An odd piece of Logick, but suitable to all the rest.</p>

We cannot put <hi>God's Grace</hi> and our <hi>Internal Satisfaction</hi> into <hi>Syllogisms</hi> when we are <hi>disputing.</hi> Nor does God intend by His Grace to prejudice the true Nature Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self has given us, which is <hi>Reason;</hi> but to perfect and elevate it.

If then we are bound to embrace Christian Faith as a <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>profess</hi> it to be <hi>so,</hi> it must be <hi>indeed</hi> such; and therefore the Grounds left us by God must be of that nature, as to prove or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it to be such: and, if Dr. <hi>St.</hi> have no such Grounds that what he holds is really <hi>Christ</hi>'s Doctrin, he ought not to handle or preach Controversie; since he must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily disgrace and weaken Christian Faith, when he is to credit and establish it.

'Tis Scripture's Letter (in Texts that are thought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to those <hi>Points</hi>) as <hi>understood</hi> or <hi>interpreted</hi> by Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or any other Private Judgment. What he has then to do, is to make out with Absolute Certainty, that this Method of arriving at the Knowledge of Christ's True Doctrin, as to those Points, cannot be <hi>Deceitful</hi> and <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous.</hi> Otherwise, 'tis unavoidable, <hi>his</hi> Faith, and <hi>all Christian</hi> Faith, no better grounded, <hi>may be False,</hi> and, by consequence, is not <hi>True.</hi> He will tell you Twenty fine Stories, and give you many pretty words of it's being <hi>Sufficiently Certain, Morally Certain,</hi> that it has such <hi>Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> as men <hi>accept</hi> for <hi>other matters,</hi> &amp;c.

Observe, I beseech you, where the stress of the whole Question lyes. 'Tis in this, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Ground or Method of <hi>his</hi> to be assur'd of Faith, is able to prove it to have been truly and indeed taught by Christ, so as it <hi>was not possible it should be otherwise.</hi> By this Test, if you examin the <hi>very good-Grounds</hi> for the <hi>Certainty of</hi> his <hi>Protestant Faith,</hi> which he promises you here in his Preface, you will find evidently he only gives you <hi>very good Words</hi> instead of <hi>very good Grounds;</hi> and that, whatever he produces, whether he <hi>quotes</hi> or <hi>argues,</hi>

he will never vouch them to be so Certain, but <hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Errour</hi> may <hi>possibly</hi> consist with them. He will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that 'tis an unreasonable expectation, because the <hi>nature of the things will not bear it.</hi> And what's this, but to tell you in other terms, that there neither is any Absolute Certainty of Faith, nor can be <hi>any:</hi> which bids fair for Atheism, unless Interest satisfies the <hi>Will,</hi> and by it the <hi>Reason.</hi> By his speaking there of <hi>the main Points in Controversie between us,</hi> I perceive he is running from the whole business in hand, and seeking to shelter himself, and hide his Head in a Wilderness.

And, in another place, speaking of a false <hi>Pointing</hi> of the Letter, made by the <hi>Arians,</hi> to abet their Heresie, he confutes them thus; <note n="*" place="margin">De Doct.

with the Drs. Principles or ours, is left to your selves or any man of reason to judg and determine.</p>
                  <p n="30">§. 30. Thus comes off this famous Sermon which makes such a noise, for a Confutation of the Traditionary Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trin. The Sum of it is, 1. The Dr. takes no notice of the main Question betwixt us, which is about the <hi>Absolute-Certainty</hi> that our <hi>Faith</hi> is Truly Christian or taught by Christ, nor attempts to shew <hi>his</hi> is thus Certain; but Preaches to you <hi>Stedfastness</hi> and a <hi>well-setled Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to continue in it, yet avoids the giving you any Grounds to make you <hi>Stedfast</hi> and <hi>Well-setled</hi> in that <hi>resolution.</hi> 2. He conceals every Advantage <hi>Christian Tradition</hi> has, or is <hi>pretended</hi> to have; that is, he would perswade you to <hi>Hate</hi> it, before you <hi>See</hi> it, and to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi> it to Scripture before you know what kind of thing it is; which is yet worse, he shews you <hi>another</hi> thing for <hi>It,</hi> and through all his Discourse pretends <hi>'tis It,</hi> which is nothing at all to It, but utterly unlike It; <hi>viz. Particular Traditions,</hi> both before and after that <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Tradition</hi> (only which we defend) was <hi>setled.</hi> 3. He fixes a <hi>false date</hi> upon the beginning of <hi>the</hi> Tradition we speak of, that the vast <hi>source</hi> of it, which (with the Circumstances annext) was able to continue the <hi>Current</hi> strong, and the <hi>Derivation</hi> of Christ's Doctrin both <hi>Certain</hi> and <hi>Perpetual,</hi> might not be reflected on. To deform it the more, he makes it meerly <hi>Verbal,</hi> as if it were nothing but the telling some dry story, by surpressing it's <hi>Practicalness,</hi> in which consists it's chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Vertue. 4. He hides from your consideration all the most Incomparable, and most Powerful Motives which enforce its Continuance, and oblige the Church never to forsake the first deliver'd Doctrin. 5. He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver regards, even in those <hi>Particular Traditions,</hi> whether they fail'd the Persons, or the Persons fail'd <hi>Them</hi>; but
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44996:135"/>
supposes still the Tradition was in all the fault, without attempting to shew it. 6. He would have you imagin the Church in the first Age (consisting of Pastors and People) lost all their <hi>Memory</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> too, assoon as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Apostles were dead, lest it should be held <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and <hi>Willing</hi> to <hi>testify</hi> Christ's Doctrine to the Next Age, which by Parity would Establish it a <hi>Rule</hi> for all succeeding Ages to the End of the World. 7. He mingles known <hi>Opinions,</hi> and which he holds <hi>himself not</hi> to <hi>have been</hi> Universally deliver'd at first, with Points which we <hi>All</hi> hold to <hi>have been</hi> first deliver'd. Then, as to the <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Object</hi> of Tradition, which, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which we pretend it is to bring down with abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Certainty,</hi> and deliver <hi>Clearly (viz.</hi> the <hi>Dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical or Controverted Articles of Christian Faith,</hi> which are Practical) he <hi>never</hi> mentions it <hi>at all</hi> with any distinction, but tumbles and confounds it with all things imaginable for which it was <hi>never</hi> pretended; and puts upon Tradition a hundred abus'd tasks as never thought of by us, so <hi>improper,</hi> &amp; oft times <hi>impossible</hi> in themselves; As, the deriving down the Ten Commandments, Creeds, Decrees of Councils, <hi>set Forms of Words,</hi> an Infinity of particular passages not at all <hi>Practical,</hi> nay, whole E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles and Gospels, Schemes of Doctrin taught by Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philosophers; Messages which use to be sent by long Letters; Historical Narrations or Actions; and in a word, every thing he could invent but the <hi>right one</hi> (viz. Those <hi>Controverted Points of Faith</hi>) tho' it lay just before him: the very nature of <hi>Controversy,</hi> which we are about, determining our Discourses to those Points, and nothing else: This is his <hi>General view of Scripture and Tradition, as to the way of conveying down matters of Faith.</hi> He means a <hi>General view,</hi> which misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents and blinds your sight of it in <hi>every Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:44996:135"/>
In a Word, there is much of Reading, Conduct and Wit in his Sermon; but wholly misemploy'd to speak as handsomely as he could <hi>to no purpose,</hi> and to <hi>miss</hi> the whole Point in <hi>Question</hi> with a great deal of Plausibility. In which, amongst his other Great Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, justly acknowledg'd to be Excellent, consists his most considerable Talent and Dexterity.</p>
                  <p n="31">§. 31. So he ends his Sermon with good Advice to you to follow Christ's Heavenly Doctrin in your <hi>Lives</hi> and Conversations. Which, as he worthily presses upon you, so I shall heartily pray that God would vouchsafe you his Grace to follow it. I am far from blaming His or any one's Preaching the wholsome Moral Doctrines of Christianity, and laying it home to men's <hi>Consciences:</hi> But I ought not, if concern'd, to suffer, that, when he pretends to speak to your <hi>Understandings,</hi> and establish you in Faith, he should bubble his Auditory with forty impertinent pretences, Injurious to his candid Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and to Truth, as well as to your selves; please and delude your Fancies with a great shew of his Reading, and little conjectural Reflexions tack't prettily toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and, in the mean time, send you away empty of knowing any Ground which may render you, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> that what you hold is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Christ's Doctrin; that is, any Ground of perfect se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; that is, <hi>cannot but be indeed his Doctrin;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being which it ought not be held <hi>True.</hi> Whereas yet, 'tis only <hi>this</hi> Certainty which can give His or any other Sermon it's full force and Energy.</p>

                     <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>WHen a Person is incomparably qualify'd above all others in any Particular; men use to look upon him as a <hi>Pattern</hi> in that Kind. I will not say Dr <hi>St.</hi> has manifested himself to be such an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar</hi> in every respect that can be an Ingredient of an <hi>Ill Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertist.</hi> This is yet to be shewn; and Pretence without Proof signifies nothing: Only I may justly fear that, while you are reading my <hi>Reply</hi> to his <hi>Answer</hi> (as he calls it) to my <hi>Catholick Letters,</hi> you may be apt to judge that I am rather framing an <hi>Idea</hi> of what Human Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness maintaining an insupportably-ill Cause may be obnoxious to, than giving a Iust Character of his Performances; and that, 'tis Absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Impossible that a Man of his Parts should be Guilty of such and so many Incredible Failings. I acknowledge with all due Respect to him, his Great Endowments; and am heartily glad, in Truth's behalf, I am engag'd with an Adversary to whom no Personal Insufficiency can be objected. Nothing could make the Victory come more Clear to the Cause I am defending; and the more Dr <hi>St.</hi> is rais'd above the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Levell of Writers, the more Evidently it will appear that nothing but the pure force of <hi>Truth</hi> could drive a man of his Abilities to such unparallel'd Shifts and Subterfuges, to palliate that Errour the Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
<pb facs="tcp:44996:138"/>
of which he had so unfortunately espous'd. Nor is it to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at, that even the best Wit in the World should be baffled while it maintains such a Cause: For, were it some Errour of an ordinary size that he defended, or were the Truth which he opposes of a trivial Importance, Rhetorick and misus'd Wit might perhaps bear it down, and gain a seeming Victory over it: but when the sole Point is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even what we all hold to have been the Faith taught by Christ, <hi>may</hi> for ought any man living <hi>knows,</hi> be perhaps <hi>none of his;</hi> and so, a <hi>Falshood</hi> and a Lying Story; 'tis not to be imagin'd that any Tricks of Human Skill can prevail against a Point of that Sacred Concern. It belongs to the Wisdom of our Good God, to settle those things most firmly, which are of the greatest Weight; and therefore the Certainty we are to have that Christ was indeed the Author of the Faith we profess, being such an Incomparable Good, and the <hi>Basis</hi> of all our Spiritual Building, must be by far more unremovably establisht, and more surely plac't above a tottering Contingency, than the strongest Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of this Material World; whence, all Attempts to undermine, and weaken this Certainty (which as shall be seen is the Chief Endeavour of Dr <hi>St.</hi>) must be proportionably Weak and Ruinous.</p>
                  <p>To give you a Map of his <hi>main</hi> Performances taken from his Book <hi>in short,</hi> and prov'd upon him in this Reply.</p>
                  <p>First, Whereas 'tis the Principal Duty of a Controvertist (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, writing about the <hi>Grounds of Faith</hi>) to <hi>justify,</hi> that is to <hi>prove</hi> Faith to be <hi>True;</hi> the Dr is so far from <hi>doing,</hi> or <hi>allowing</hi> this good Office to be done to Faith, that he maintains the direct contrary. Nay, he will not grant so much honour to any <hi>Particular Point</hi> of Faith (and our <hi>Whole</hi> Faith is made up of such <hi>Particulars</hi>) as to let it enjoy even <hi>his own</hi> kind of Absolute Certainty, tho' that falls short of <hi>proving</hi> any thing to be above possibility of Falshood or (which is the same) <hi>True;</hi> but says over and over in perfectly equivalent terms that the <hi>Sense</hi> which himself, or any man (or Church either) has of Scripture in particular Points, <hi>may not be</hi> the <hi>True Sense</hi> of it; that is, may not be <hi>Christ's Doctrin;</hi> which if it <hi>be not,</hi> it <hi>may not be True;</hi> And is it possible that what <hi>may not be True,</hi> can at the same time <hi>be True;</hi> that is, Is it possible that <hi>Truth may not be its self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, We are writing <hi>Controversy,</hi> and consequently treating of <hi>Faith</hi> precisely according to a particular consideration belonging to
<pb facs="tcp:44996:138"/>
it, which is, <hi>by what way 'tis with Absolute Certainty derivable from Christ.</hi> This has been repeated and Eccho'd to him over and over even to Surfeit. This was the Scope and Occasion of the <hi>Conference.</hi> This is exprest in my <hi>Short Discourse</hi> against <hi>his</hi> way of having Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Christ's Doctrin; and clearly aim'd at in Mr <hi>G's</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration. Nay, this has been told him fifteen years ago in <hi>Errour Non-plust, p. 44.</hi> Where I in these plainest words thus <hi>Stated the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</hi>
                     <q>[It being then agreed amongst us all that what Christ and his Apostles taught is God's Word, or his Will, and the Means to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all that is to be done by us as to matters of Faith, is to know with Absolute Certainty what was the first-taught Doctrin, or Christ's Sense; and whatever can thus assure us of That, is deservedly call'd, <hi>The Rule of Faith.</hi>]</q>
Yet, tho' we should trumpet this into his Ears every moment, he is still Deaf, and never takes notice of it, or regards it in his whole Reply; Nay, he diverts from it with all the hast he can make, when our express words force him to it. To do this with the greater Formality and Solemnity, he Entitles his Book, <hi>[A Discourse concerning the Nature and Grounds of the Certainty of Faith.]</hi> Which Expression is so Large, that it leaves it Indifferent for him, under that Head, either to treat of Faith as 'tis <hi>in its self,</hi> viz. as 'tis <hi>Divine;</hi> or of Faith as 'tis <hi>Controverted between us;</hi> that is of our Faith as 'tis Ascertainable <hi>to us</hi> to be Christ's true Doctrin. And, that we may see this was done by Design, when he comes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Sense of those Equivocal Words, he pitches upon that Meaning of them which is quite beside our purpose, and nothing at all to our Question: viz. upon Christ's Faith as 'tis <hi>Divine;</hi> which is not disputed but <hi>agreed</hi> to be such; and this, whether the Faith comes to our knowledge by <hi>Tradition</hi> attesting it; or by an <hi>Absolutely Certain Interpretation of Scripture;</hi> and the sole Question is, whether the <hi>Tradition of the Church</hi> or the <hi>Letter of Scripture</hi> interpreted by any Way his Principles afford us, be the more <hi>Certain</hi> and more <hi>Clear</hi> Way to give us <hi>Christ's Sense,</hi> or (which is the same) our <hi>Faith.</hi> How untoward a Procedure is it then, to stand quoting our School-Divines against me, whenas the Objects of Controversy and of School-Divinity are so vastly different: the one treating of Faith as made known to the World at first by Divine-Revelation; the other, of the <hi>Way</hi> to know <hi>now</hi> what was <hi>at first</hi> Divinely reveal'd, by <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Motives inducing men to the Acceptation of it of for the <hi>same
<pb facs="tcp:44996:139"/>
Doctrin.</hi> Hence, also, when he was to bring Arguments which should evince, by his Principles, that the Faith held <hi>now</hi> is the same that was reveal'd at <hi>first,</hi> to avoid that impossible task, he falls unseasonably to alledge <hi>God's Grace</hi> and Invisible <hi>Moral Qualifications:</hi> Which, tho' absolutely requisit in many regards to Faith as 'tis <hi>formally Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;</hi> yet are they most improper to be alledg'd in Controversy against an Adversary, for a Proof that what he holds is the first-taught Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; since only God himself can know whether the Alledger or any man else has those Supernatural Means or no.</p>
                  <p>To put a stop once for all to this impertinent Topick, and to shew how he trifles while he quotes our School-Divines, I alledge First, that the plain state of the Question lately given, which runs through our whole Controversy, has forestall'd all he can object from them; unless he can shew that they <hi>stated the Question,</hi> and treated of <hi>Faith</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Consideration, as we do in our Controversy; which I am Certain he cannot instance in so much as any <hi>one</hi> of them: And in case they <hi>do not state it</hi> after the <hi>same</hi> manner we do in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy, with what sense can it be pretended that I contradict <hi>Them,</hi> or They <hi>Me,</hi> whenas we do not speak of the same Point, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction must be <hi>ad idem?</hi> Secondly, Our Divines bring Motives of Credibility to prove Christian Faith to be <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>True;</hi> such as are Miracles, the Conversion of the World, the Sufferings of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Very good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would Dr <hi>St.</hi> reply, these might prove the Faith profest <hi>in those times</hi> to be <hi>True:</hi> but you have alter'd that Faith <hi>since,</hi> and therefore you are to prove that the Faith you profess <hi>now</hi> is the same which was <hi>of old.</hi> So that, out of the very nature of our circumstances, <hi>This</hi> is the <hi>Only</hi> Point between us, and the main busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our Controversy about the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> or the Ground that can justify its Invariable Conveyance downwards; for, this being made out by us, all the rest is admitted. Thirdly, Hence both the Protestants and We agree, that <hi>That is to be called the Rule of Faith</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>by which the knowledge of Christ's Doctrin is convey'd certainly down to us at the distance of so many Ages from the time of its first Delivery.</hi> Does any of our School-Divines take the Words <hi>[Rule of Faith]</hi> in this Sense? Not one. They content themselves with what serves for their purpose, and call that a <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> which barely <hi>contains</hi> Faith. Fourthly, Our <hi>only</hi> Point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to know assuredly the former Faith by a Certain Conveyer, how
<pb facs="tcp:44996:139"/>
must this be made out to those who are enquiring what is Christ's True Doctrin? Must we bid them rely on their <hi>Private</hi> Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture? No surely; for this is the way Proper to all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. Must we bring them the <hi>Publick</hi> Interpretation of it by the <hi>Church</hi>? This might do the deed so we could manifest this by some Knowledges those Candidates are already possess'd of, and did admit. Must we then, at the first dash, alledge the Publick Interpretation of the Church <hi>Divinely assisted?</hi> What effect can this have upon those who do not yet hold that Tenet; and, consequently, how can this be a Proper Argument to convince <hi>them?</hi> It remains then that we can only <hi>begin</hi> with their unelevated Reason, by alledging the Church's <hi>Human-Authority</hi> or <hi>Tradition</hi> (the most vast and best-qualify'd Testimony to convey down a notorious <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> of Infinite. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that ever was since the World was Created) for a Certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer of Faith from the time that those <hi>Motives of Credibility,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Faith to be <hi>Divine,</hi> were on foot. And, if so, why not with the same labour, and for the same Reasons, to bring it down from the very Beginning of the Church? And if we must <hi>alledge</hi> it, are we not oblig'd, as Disputants, to bring such Arguments, to <hi>prove</hi> that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority Certain, as do <hi>conclude</hi> that Point? If they do not, what are they good for in a Controversy, or what signifies a <hi>Proof</hi> that <hi>Concludes</hi> nothing? This is the Sum of my Procedure and my Reasons for it in short; which are abundantly sufficient to shew to any man of Sense, that, while the Doctor objects our School-Divines to one in my Circumstances, his hand is all the while <hi>in the wrong Box,</hi> as will more at large be shewn hereafter. He might have seen cited by me in my <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Clypeus Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templex,</hi> two Writers of great Eminency, <hi>viz.</hi> Father <hi>Fisher,</hi> the most Learned Controvertist of his Age here in <hi>England;</hi> and a Modern Author, <hi>Dominicus de Sancta Trinitate,</hi> whose Book was Printed at <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and appprov'd by the <hi>Magister Sacri Palatii,</hi> who (to omit divers others) do abet each particular Branch of my Doctrin; which renders insignificant all his pretence of my Singularity, and my Opposition to the Catholick Controvertists.</p>
                  <p>But to leave off this necessary Digression and proceed. As our Doctor has shuffled off the whole Question by taking the word <hi>[Faith]</hi> as treated of by <hi>us,</hi> in a wrong Sense, so he behaves himself as ill in every particular of the rest of his Title; <hi>viz.</hi> in his discoursing of his pretended <hi>[Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty]</hi> of Faith, and of the <hi>[Nature]</hi> and the <hi>[Grounds]</hi> of it. He
<pb facs="tcp:44996:140"/>
cannot be won to give us any Account how his Grounds Influence the Points of Faith with the <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> he pretended. And as for the <hi>Certainty</hi> it self, (the only word of his Title that is left) he never shews how any one Article (even though it be most Fundamentall) is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely secur'd from being <hi>False</hi> or <hi>Heretical,</hi> by any <hi>Rule, Ground</hi> or <hi>Way</hi> he assigns us. Nor can I imagin any thing could tempt him to so strange Extravagances, but the <hi>streight</hi> he was in, being put to shew his Faith Absolutely Certain; and his <hi>Despondency</hi> ever to perform an Vndertaking, which he foresaw was, by his shallow Principles, impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be atchiev'd. And hence he was necessitated to all these crafty Shifts, and Wiles, and all those Vnsound Methods which, like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complicated Diseases, affect his languishing Discourse and dying Cause; as shall be laid open in the Progress of this Discourse, and, particularly, in the Concluding Section. I shall only instance at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in two or three Material ones, which, like the Grain in wood, run through his whole Work. For Example:</p>
                  <p>When any Question is propounded which grows too troublesome, he never pursues that Game but flushes up another, and flies at <hi>that,</hi> 'till the true Point be out of sight. Tell him our Point is whether the High <hi>Mysteries</hi> and other <hi>Spiritual</hi> Articles of Faith be <hi>Clear</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; he will never answer <hi>directly,</hi> but runs to Points <hi>necessary to Salvation.</hi> Ask him if the Tenet of Christ's Godhead be <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Salvation;</hi> no direct Answer can we get to that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, tho' it be the very Point we instanc't in. Press him that there are no <hi>Unnecessary</hi> Points; and, therefore, that All are Necessary for the <hi>Generality</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> he cries <hi>Alas for me!</hi> but answers nothing. Ask him what Points he accounts <hi>Necessary?</hi> He is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly mute: 'Till at length he shuffles about so, that the true Question which is about a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> comes to be chang'd into a <hi>Rule of Manners;</hi> and those High Spiritual Points which are most properly <hi>Christian,</hi> and could only be known to the World by <hi>Divine Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> are thrown aside; and <hi>Moral</hi> ones put in their place, which were known to many even of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Writers. And this is the best Sense I can pick out of a man who affects to <hi>wrap</hi> up those Tenets of his, and their Consequences, which he thinks would not be for his Credit to discover, in <hi>Mysterious Reserves.</hi> The like Shuffling he uses in the Notion of <hi>Certainty,</hi> or any other that is of Concern in our present Dispute; for he is a very Impartial
<pb facs="tcp:44996:140"/>
man, and treats them All alike. Ask him then, If <hi>Faith</hi> be Absolutely Certain by his Grounds? He will not say it, but more than once hints the contrary. Are the <hi>Grounds</hi> of it at least <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> tho' he makes them such ill-natur'd things that (contrary to all other Grounds in the world) they keep their Absolute Certainty to themselves, and will let <hi>Faith</hi> have none of it? Yes; he'll tell you they are; provided that by <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> you will mean such a Certainty as will permit those Grounds <hi>may be False,</hi> and Faith built upon them <hi>much more:</hi> for we are to know 'tis a Maxim with him that the Absolute Certainty he allows his <hi>Grounds</hi> is possible to be False, and he allows a less degree of Certainty to <hi>Particular Points</hi> than to his Grounds, so that <hi>Faith</hi> may much <hi>more</hi> easily be False then his Grounds may, though they may be False too. And all this out of an Antipathy I suppose, to <hi>Infallibility,</hi> because the abominable Papists own it; as if <hi>Mankind</hi> did not use to say they are <hi>Infallibly Certain</hi> of some things before the Papists were born. What then is this Absolute Certainty? Is it meerly built on his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension</hi> or <hi>Thinking</hi> it so? No, but upon such an <hi>Evidence</hi> as the <hi>Thing is capable of.</hi> Very good. Is <hi>any</hi> thing in the world <hi>capable to be known</hi>? 'Tis a strange Paradox to deny it; and yet if he grants it he cannot escape meeting with this bug-bear <hi>Infallibility</hi>: For, if the Knowledge (as it is) <hi>be as the Thing is,</hi> and the Thing <hi>be Infallibly as it self is,</hi> the Knowledge is <hi>Infallibly</hi> as the Thing is. Here Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men you may expect he will turn it off with some scornfull Irony, for he never in his life answer'd any such pressing Reason any other way. But the Argument will not be laught out of Countenance; and therefore if Infallibility must be allow'd, he is to shew us what harm would come to Faith if the Previous Grounds of it, <hi>as to our Knowledge, were</hi> thus Certain? None at all. But then, alas! his <hi>Credit</hi> and his <hi>Cause</hi> will go to wrack; for no shew or shadow of any such Argument can his super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Principles allow us: and therefore no Absolute Certainty will he yield to the Grounds to know Christ's Faith, but such a one as permits all Mankind may be deceiv'd in them, and <hi>much more</hi> in knowing what <hi>is</hi> his Doctrin it self after we have those Grounds: For <hi>Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> shall not mean <hi>Infallibility,</hi> let us say and prove what we will. However I'le venture to ask him once more; Since (as he says) the Thing, notwithstanding the Absolute Certainty we have of its being <hi>True,</hi> may yet be <hi>False,</hi> let us suppose (as 'tis not impossible, there being some degree of Contingency in it) that it happens to <hi>be</hi> False; Can he in that Case have Absolute Certainty that a <hi>Falshood</hi> is <hi>True?</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:44996:141"/>
Here it goes hard with him, nor can all his old Heathen Philosophers, he so oft recurrs to, in the least help him out. He has but one Refuge that I know of to sly to; and that is to use some trick to shuffle away from Absolute Certainty, and say that he meant by it <hi>Sufficient Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> and <hi>That</hi> he'l stick to when all his new notions fail him. For Absolute Certainty he was unluckily <hi>forc't upon</hi> by Mr G. tho' he had no acquaintance with it, or friendship for it; but his <hi>Inclination</hi> and <hi>Heart</hi> was for <hi>Sufficient Certainty.</hi> And good reason, for in the Sanctuary of that Common Word he's as safe as in an Enchanted Castle. Those scurvy Particularizing Expressions are <hi>Tell-tales,</hi> and by their <hi>Lavishness</hi> are apt to discover <hi>Sense</hi> or <hi>Nonsense;</hi> but <hi>This</hi> keeps <hi>aloof,</hi> and by signifying nothing at all <hi>determinately,</hi> is past the reach of any Confute. But if you tell him 'tis a <hi>Relative</hi> word, and put him upon proving that his <hi>possibly-False Certainty</hi> is <hi>Sufficient</hi> to <hi>conclude</hi> it to be <hi>True,</hi> that any Point of his Faith is the same that our Divine Master taught the World, he'l no more <hi>hear</hi> or <hi>mind</hi> you than he did me when I alledg'd that a <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Ground</hi> were <hi>Relative</hi> words too; and, therefore, must communicate their Certainty to all the Particular Points they relate to. And, if you continue to press him hard with such <hi>Cramp-questions,</hi> he'l tell you he's not at leasure, having his foot in the stirrup to take a long Iourney as far as <hi>Trent</hi>: So being Bankrupt of <hi>Reason,</hi> he withdraws his <hi>Effects</hi> thence to <hi>Trade</hi> more fortunately (as he hopes) in <hi>Citations;</hi> and finding himself beaten at <hi>Tradition</hi> he gets Letters of Reprizall from his new Logick to revenge himself on us in combating the <hi>Tridentin Council;</hi> To which he will receive an Answer when he first shews us that he <hi>stood firm</hi> in his own Principles at <hi>home,</hi> ere he took such a <hi>leap</hi> beyond Sea; and Satisfies the World how it is possible that a man who confesses he has no Absolute Certainty of Christian Faith, can be sufficiently qualify'd either to <hi>prove</hi> any Tenet of his <hi>own,</hi> or <hi>disprove</hi> any Tenet of <hi>others</hi> to be truly <hi>Christian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In a word, his chief Art is to Cloak his Arts, and he is a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster at it. His Aim is to make his Discourses run plausibly, whatever it costs his Credit: which he hopes is so great now with the Inferiour Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, that, let him be as Prodigall of it as he will, it can never be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted. The telling of his tale smoothly will take much with those Readers who dwell in the middle story: But strip his Discourse of all those needfull Ornaments and Assistances, and 'tis plain impertinent Nonsense <hi>in cuerpo.</hi> For, not any thing like a solid Ground is found in
<pb facs="tcp:44996:141"/>
his whole Book: The Manufacture and Contrivance of it is all in all.</p>
                  <p>It may perhaps be thought by some that I am too downright with him in divers of my Expressions; but I desire them to consider that I do not use him half so rudely as some of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have done; and besides, that in doing that little I did, I do but write after his own Copy; and fall very short too of imitating him, as appears by his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Viper, venomous froth, Gall, Spleen, Folly, Malice,</hi> &amp;c. His Faults are <hi>Great,</hi> and <hi>Many;</hi> and must I not <hi>Name</hi> them when I am oblig'd to lay them open? If I <hi>must,</hi> the very <hi>Names</hi> we give to <hi>Great Faults</hi> will be <hi>Harsh words,</hi> let <hi>me</hi> do what I can. Yet I have mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated them as much as the sense of what I ow'd to <hi>Christian Faith</hi> would give me leave. Besides as my <hi>Genius</hi> leads me to carry it friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with unpretended Honesty tho' Erring; so it inclines me to show less respect to a man, who as I see plainly by a constant Experience, has none at all for <hi>Truth,</hi> but practices and pursues all over <hi>Study'd Insincerity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have one <hi>Request,</hi> or rather a fair <hi>Offer</hi> to <hi>make</hi> the Dr. which is, that, since it is so mortifying to a man who, (as appears by all his former Writings) aims to reduce Truth to <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> to be still task't in laying open such multitudes of his Shifts and Prevarications<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (For I do think in my Conscience I have not either in this <hi>Preface,</hi> or my following Book even hinted a quarter of them) he would condescend that we may each of us chuse two worthy Gentlemen; who, leaving out the Question of <hi>Right,</hi> may examin only <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> viz. which of us uses Indirect Tricks and Stratagems to avoid the force of Truth, and which of us candidly pursues it; and let them after a mutuall protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon their Honours, that they will pass an Impartial Verdict, give under their Hands the particulars in which each of us have notoriously fail'd or falter'd: I mean that such Faults, whether of <hi>Commission</hi> or <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> should be noted as may appear to be wilfully disingenuous or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly Insincere, and not meerly <hi>Humane Oversights.</hi> This fair and Equal Offer, Gentlemen, will exceedingly conduce to your and all our Readers Satisfaction; and Dr <hi>St</hi>'s accepting it is the only way to do right to his <hi>Credit,</hi> which stands impeacht of using such unworthy Methods: And your pressing him to it, will be both a Iustification of your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Esteem for him, and be also received as a very great favour by</p>

                  <p n="1">1. IN his Preamble Dr. <hi>St.</hi> according to his usual way of confuting, quarrels every word he meets with, and gives every circumstance an invidious turn. This looks <hi>brisk</hi>; but how <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>flat</hi> he is in his Arguments shall be seen hereafter. In the mean time the dimmest Eye may discern how Impertinent this is to our <hi>Dispute,</hi> and to the <hi>Certainty of his Grounds of Faith,</hi> nay to his own Title-page. I am sorry to see him so much out of humour, as to run against, and strike at every thing near him, tho' it lay not in his way. But <hi>sinking</hi> men, when their case is <hi>desperate,</hi> must catch at <hi>straws</hi> having no firmer support at hand to keep them from <hi>drowning. First,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 1.</note> He wonders why Mr. <hi>G.</hi> did not defend his own cause himself. He was at that very time call'd upon to attend his Majesties Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and it was a Duty owing to Truth and our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, as well as Charity and Friendship to him, that some body should step in to supply for him. 2<hi>ly, Why must</hi> J. S. <hi>be the man?</hi> Because it was desir'd of him; and, he was besides prest to it by many Judicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; as one who had, in their Opinion, and by the Dr's own tacit Confession by his silence for 15 years, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerably overthrown his Principles in <hi>Error Non-plust</hi>; and, besides, he was <hi>injur'd, provok'd,</hi> and in a manner <hi>Challeng'd</hi> by him in his <hi>Second Letter,</hi> by his quoting and abetting <hi>Haeresis Blacloana,</hi> which was writ design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44996:143"/>
against <hi>Him</hi>; and by pretending the way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy he follow'd, was <hi>Pelagainism.</hi> Now it belong'd properly to <hi>I. S.</hi> to clear this by his own Pen; and (whatever the Dr's Intention was) I am to thank him he has put a force upon me to Vindicate my self in <hi>English,</hi> which I have done in <note n="*" place="margin">Clypeus Septemplex &amp; Vindiciae.</note> two <hi>Latin</hi> Treatises a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ten years ago, to the Satisfaction of my Judges and Superiors, and the farther Illustration and Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what I had written in my former Books. 3<hi>ly,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 2.</note> He quarrels the Titles of my <hi>Catholick Letters,</hi> and that <hi>no one Church of the Christian World ever own'd it.</hi> And does he in his great Learning think the <hi>Church</hi> is to <hi>Own,</hi> or prescribe every one their particular Methods of handling <hi>Controversy?</hi> All she is to do is to <hi>deliver</hi> to us <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Doctrine</hi>; and then leave it to the Learning of her <hi>Controvertists</hi> to take such Methods to defend it as best sutes with their Circumstances, and the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of the Persons they are to treat with. Are all the <note n="*" place="margin">See Error Non-plust.</note> 
                     <hi>Principles</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> laid? Is all his Discourse at the Conference with Mr. <hi>G?</hi> Is his avow'd Position, that <hi>every Sober Enquirer may without the Churches help find out all necessary Points of Faith,</hi> own'd by <hi>any one Catholick Church?</hi> I know not what that Great Conventicle of <hi>Geneva</hi> may do, or what the <hi>new one</hi> that is now ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting here by the <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. Burnet, Dr. Tillotson. and Dr. Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet.</note> Triumvirate of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Reformers, mentioned in the scurrilous Reply to the Bishop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> may do in time, when they haue brought about their Projects; but I am confident he shall never find <hi>any one Catholick Church</hi> that ever <hi>own'd</hi> diverse of his <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>that Position.</hi> 4<hi>ly,</hi> But why did I not call those <hi>Letters [Roman-Catholick] but [Catholick.]</hi> He tells the Reader with much assuredness <hi>I durst not do so, because I had not forgotten how hardly I had lately escaped Censure at</hi> Rome. Now, another man whose Reason was free and undisturb'd, would think I should

rather have done this, in <hi>Gratitude</hi> to their allowing and accepting my Defence upon such honourable terms as a <hi>kind Admonition,</hi> that <hi>mindfull of the Apostles words,</hi>

                     <hi>ambiguity of a word.</hi> My true reason, if he will needs have it, was, because Dr. <hi>St's private-spirited Rule</hi> was Common to <hi>all Hereticks</hi>; and the Rule I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended was quite opposite to it, and therefore <hi>Catholick</hi>; and this, even in the sense of many Eminent Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, who pretend to Universal Tradition as the Rule, to ascertain their Interpretations of Scripture; to whom the name of [<hi>Roman</hi>] is not so agreeable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Dr. will still be leaving the road-way of the Question, tho' (which I am sorry to see) he runs himself into the Bryars most wofully. So he tells the Reader I ought to have let him alone, and not have writ against him,<note place="margin">P. 3.</note> because I <hi>have done next to nothing for my self,</hi> and <hi>seem to have forgotten the Answer to my</hi> Sure-footing, meaning Dr. <hi>Tillotson's Rule of Faith.</hi> Yes, quite forgotten it without doubt! About two Months after that Answer came out, I publish'd my <hi>Letter of Thanks.</hi> In which I laid open how he had mistaken still the main point in Controversy; how he had willfully <hi>perverted</hi> my Sense <hi>all along,</hi> and <hi>falsify'd</hi> my Words in <hi>many places</hi>; nay, inserted some of his <hi>own,</hi> and then <hi>impugn'd</hi> what himself had disingenuously <hi>added</hi>; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended my Testimonies, and reply'd to the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning passages. Then, observing that his <hi>whole</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer proceeded on a False Ground, <hi>viz.</hi> That there was no Rule of Faith but what left it under the Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous ignominy of being <hi>perhaps False,</hi> that is, indeed <hi>no Rule at all</hi>; therefore to stubb-up his shallow-rooted work from its Foundations, I writ another Treatise
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44996:144"/>
[<hi>Faith Uindicated</hi>] in which I demonstrated from many Heads that <note n="*" place="margin">Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Faith Vindication.</note> 
                     <hi>the Motives as laid in Second Causes by Gods Providence to light Mankind in their way to Faith,</hi> or the (<hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> (and consequently Faith it self, in what it depends on that Rule, that is, as to us,) must be <hi>Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be false</hi>; and <note n="*" place="margin">Faith Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated. P. 167 to the End.</note> apply'd it home against Dr <hi>St.</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tillotson</hi> at the End of that Treatise; and thence shew'd that his Book could have no just claim to any farther Answer, and that the branches must necessarily be held <hi>Wither'd</hi> and <hi>Sapless</hi> when the <hi>Root</hi> was once shown to be rotten. Nor content with this, I follow'd on my blow and penn'd a short discourse, entitled <hi>The Method to arrive at Satisfaction in Religion</hi>; comprizing, in short, the strength of <hi>Sure footing</hi>; and reduc't each branch of it to <hi>Self-Evident Propositions,</hi> which force Humane Nature to assent to their Verity. Farther it was not possible to go. Yet all this, my candid Adversaries, who must not acknowledge it for fear of giving under their hands they owe a Debt they can never pay, slubber over with assuring their Readers, <hi>I have done next to nothing</hi> in my own Defence. It seems that to talk <hi>triflingly</hi> is with them to do <hi>All</hi>; and <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>clearest Evidences,</hi> are either <hi>Nothing at all,</hi> or <hi>next to it.</hi>

Why, he had a mind to print his Sermons; and, knowing his Auditory were his best-inclin'd Friends, in a <hi>Preface</hi> (forsooth) to them, he gives a slight touch at each of those Treatises. He endeavours to clear himself of <hi>Two</hi> of his many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerities, and (oh wonderfull!) with about <hi>a dozen Iests</hi> quite confutes <hi>Three Books.</hi> I would not let him rest so, nor enjoy even this empty vapour; but gave a full and distinct Reply to his <hi>Preface</hi> in <hi>Reason against Raillery.</hi> I instructed his shallow Logick, utterly unacquainted with the <hi>First Principles of our Vnderstanding,</hi> with which Nature imbues even the rudest. I prov'd against him
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44996:144"/>
evidently those few of his many faults of which he had labour'd to purge himself. I laid open the Folly and Weakness of his <hi>First Principle</hi>; and accus'd him severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of making both <hi>Christian Faith</hi> and the Tenet of a <hi>Deity</hi> uncertain; and this by vertue of that very <hi>First Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> of his: And, out of my zeal for such dear concerns, I charg'd home upon him those two shamefull Tenets by many Arguments. Since which time he has not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd a word, but has sate very contentedly under that heaviest Scandal full fifteen Years; and now he stands indebted to me for an Answer to all those Treatises. And I have been so civil a <hi>Creditor</hi> as not once to call upon him severely for such considerable <hi>Arrears,</hi> till Dr. <hi>St.</hi> would needs have me to be his <hi>Debtor,</hi> and so oblig'd me to make up the Accounts between us. Now, to have done all this, is, if a man of Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s Sincerity may be trusted, <hi>to do next to nothing,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> to have <hi>defended my self.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. But since he will have it so, let's see what Dr. <hi>St.</hi> himself, who objects this, has done to defend <hi>Himself.</hi> He undertook to write <hi>Principles</hi> for <hi>his</hi> Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. I shew'd in <note n="*" place="margin">From pa. 212. to the End.</note> 
                     <hi>Errour Nonplust</hi> he had not laid <hi>one</hi> for that particular end. I manifested that he was guilty of the most weak piece of Illogical procedure that ever mortal man stumbled upon; by making almost all his <hi>Conclusions</hi> to be <hi>Self-Evident</hi> and beyond needing any <hi>Proof</hi>; and his <hi>Principles</hi> which should <hi>prove</hi> them, and so ought to be clearer than they, <hi>Obscure</hi> or <hi>False.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Error Non-plust. p. 236.</note> I shew'd the <hi>Grounds</hi> of his Discourse to be plain <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi> and some of his pretended Principles to lead di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid. p. 123.124.</note> 
                     <hi>Phanaticism.</hi> And yet he has quietly endur'd his Doctrine, concerning the <hi>Grounds</hi> of <hi>his</hi> Faith to be stigmatiz'd for <hi>Erroneous,</hi> and himself declar'd <hi>Nonplust</hi>; nay he has had the phlegm to see himself expos'd in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Letters in the Title-Page of that Book for a <hi>Man of No Principles</hi>; and yet has born it with Invincible and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44996:145"/>
Heroical Patience full fifteen Years: Which yet I had not so particularly insisted on at this time, had he not so utterly forgot himself, as to charge me to have <hi>done next to nothing</hi> in my own defence, when I had so manifestly baffled and put to silence, (those who have most reason to pardon my glorying) Dr. <hi>Tillotson</hi> and <hi>Himself.</hi> He'll pretend I owe him an Answer to an <hi>Appendix</hi> of his: the main of which is answer'd in <hi>Faith Vindicated,</hi> where its Grounds are subverted; and, if any thing, besides the Raillery, remains unspoken to in <hi>Error Nonplust,</hi> when he pays me my <hi>Hundred Pound,</hi> I will reckon with him for his <hi>Brass Shilling.</hi> So much difference in just value <hi>Principles</hi> ought to have above a loose Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course made up of meer misrepresentations and Drol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. In the mean time, it were not amiss to give the Reader an Instance how he quite misses the bus'ness we are about, in that <hi>Appendix</hi>; which, I conceive, is the most solid way of confuting the <hi>whole.</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">App. to the Rule of Faith. p. 82.</note> [<hi>If Mr. S.</hi> (says he) <hi>would have undertaken to have told us who they were that first peopled</hi> America, <hi>and from what place they came, by the Tradition of the present Inhabitants; and what famous actions had been done there in former Ages; we might have thought indeed, that</hi> sole Tradition <hi>had been a very safe way to convey matters of Fact from one Age to another.</hi>] By which we see he both forgets that the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> we speak of is <hi>Practical,</hi> and waves all the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> to <hi>continue</hi> the memory of <hi>Christs Doctrine</hi>; which are the greatest God himself could impose, or Man's nature is capable of. He should have shewn us that those Inhabitants of <hi>America,</hi> had some Constant and Obligatory Practices and Solemnities, Commemorating their coming from another Nation, or their former Great Actions (of the same kind the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> had of their deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi>) and then he might draw thence some show of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44996:145"/>
And yet, even then, it would fall short of a Parallel to the force of <hi>Christian Tradition</hi>; unless the Matters to be convey'd were of <hi>Equal</hi> Concern, and the Obligations to propagate them, <hi>Equally</hi> forcible and binding. I shall propose to him an Instance of the force of <hi>Our</hi> Tradition, and than ask his judgment of it. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Anniversary of the <hi>Powder-Plot</hi> should be kept on foot, by Ringing of Bells, Bonefires, Squibbs, and spitefull Preaching against <hi>All</hi> Catholicks indifferently, and their very Religion it self, as guilty of that Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Treason; I would know of him whether the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of it, tho' kept alive by this Practical Solemnity but once a year, would not be perpetuated for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Generations, or how it should ever be forgot? If (as I am sure he must) he <hi>grants</hi> it; he must grant withall that the Tradition of <hi>Christ's Doctrine,</hi> which had a source incomparably <hi>larger,</hi> and was of the <hi>highest</hi> Concern to every particular Person not to <hi>desert</hi> it, but to <hi>hold</hi> to it, <hi>practice</hi> &amp; <hi>live</hi> according to it <hi>Daily,</hi> &amp; <hi>propagate</hi> it to others, must be in a manner infinitely stronger. For, sure, he will not say that the <hi>Hatred</hi> against the <hi>Papists,</hi> which, I fear, is the main Motive to continue the other, is a more powerfull Cause to effect this, than all the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> laid by God, and the Care of the <hi>Salvation</hi> of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Posterity was for the Body of the Church to <hi>perpetuate</hi> a Doctrine that came from <hi>Heaven.</hi> In a word, this one Instance is enough to shew evidently that he either <hi>grossly mistakes,</hi> or <hi>wilfully perverts</hi> in that Appendix the <hi>whole Subject</hi> about which we are there discoursing. And is such a slight piece, or such a man worth answering, were it not for the Repute he has got, not for writing <hi>for the Church of England,</hi> but for his Hatred and Scribbling <hi>against the Papists</hi>? Since this one Errour is so Fundamentall that it must needs influence all that Discourse of his as far as 'tis <hi>Serious,</hi> or pretends
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44996:146"/>
to <hi>Solidity</hi>; and, so, leaves nothing to be replied to but wilely Shuffles and aiery Trifles, which are Frivolous in themselves, and (in his Writings) Endless.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. HAving behav'd himself thus unfortunately to himself and his Friends ever since he came upon the Stage, Dr. <hi>St.</hi> comes to settle his <hi>Method,</hi> which he says, he <hi>thinks is most Natural and Effectual to proceed in,</hi> in handling <hi>the main Subject of our Debate about the Nature and Grounds of the Certainty of Faith.</hi> It consists of Four Heads: and I shall follow my Leader, he being such a Master of <hi>Method,</hi> and take them as they lie. The First is, <hi>To shew how unfit</hi> J. S. <hi>is of all men to undertake this Cause,</hi> who <hi>contradicts</hi> himself as occasion serves. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, this man has a <hi>Method</hi> as well as a <hi>Logick</hi> pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to himself. Does it follow so <hi>Naturally</hi> that Faith needs no Higher Grounds of <hi>Certainty,</hi> because J. S. writes <hi>unconstantly?</hi> Or, does he prove so <hi>Effectually</hi> he has <hi>shewn</hi> his Grounds do allow <hi>Faith, as 'tis controverted</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, the <hi>Certainty</hi> due to it's <hi>Nature,</hi> because <hi>I</hi> write <hi>weakly.</hi> But, the truth is, his <hi>Method</hi> is to <hi>avoid all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi>; and to wriggle in twenty Impertinent and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious things, to make a shew of having said <hi>a great deal,</hi> tho' <hi>to no purpose:</hi> and to raise as much <hi>Dust</hi> as he can, that he may <hi>run away</hi> from the business we are about, and <hi>hide</hi> himself in the <hi>Mist.</hi> But is he sure that <hi>I. S.</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts himself? Impartial men will doubt it, when they shall know, that both those <hi>few</hi> pretended contradictions he has borrow'd out of <hi>Lominus</hi> and <hi>many more</hi> were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44996:146"/>
and earnestly press'd against me in a far-distant Tribunal; where my self was unknown, and had <hi>few</hi> or rather <hi>no</hi> Friends, but what my <hi>Cause</hi> &amp; <hi>Defences</hi> gave me: That they were discust by those strictest Judges and compar'd with my Answers, and yet not so much as the least check given me, or any Correction of my Books, even in the least tittle, was order'd; though this be a thing not unusual in such cases: That the business already <hi>transiit in rem judicatam</hi>; and that the Satisfaction I gave <hi>then</hi> to Superiours, who could have no imaginable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be favourable to me, to the prejudice of Catholick Doctrine, is an abundant clearing of the <hi>Soundness</hi> of my <hi>Writings,</hi> and the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of my <hi>Defences.</hi> It would, I say, be enough to do this, and then leave the Doctor's malice to the Censure of all Ingenuous Persons, for <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting anew</hi> things of which I was about Eleven years ago, so authentiquely acquitted. But alas! his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> which oblig'd him to speak to the true Point as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as he could for shame, and to fill up an empty figure of an Answer with as many Impertinencies as he could well hook in, led him so <hi>directly</hi> to it, that he could not for his heart avoid it. Should he object <hi>Murther</hi> or any other heinous Crime to a pretended Malefactor, already clear'd of it by his Proper Judges and the Court, every honest man would admire at his folly; but all's merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious with his Party against the <hi>Papists.</hi> Tho', I say, this be sufficient for my Vindication; yet because those <note n="*" place="margin">Clypeus Septemplex &amp; Vindiciae.</note> Defences of mine were in <hi>Latin,</hi> and the clearing this Point conduces very much to the shortening and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating my future Answer, I shall repeat <hi>here</hi> some <hi>few</hi> particulars of <hi>many</hi> which are found there at large. And First, I shall put some notes to give a clear Light of this business. Next I shall show his Shallowness and Insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in what he objects. Thirdly, I will put down the most Authentick Approbations of my Books by the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44996:147"/>
Testimony of Learned Men <hi>of all sorts,</hi> and <hi>beyond all Exception</hi>; and then reflect on his Imprudence in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such an objection.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. For the First, I lay these Notes. 1. That <hi>School-Divines</hi> discourse of <hi>Faith</hi> under another Notion or Consideration than <hi>Controvertists</hi> do. The former treat of it as 'tis a <hi>Theological Virtue,</hi> and the <hi>Material Objects</hi> of it, as reveal'd by a Testimony <hi>formally Divine</hi>: And they <hi>prove</hi> it to be such by alledging the <hi>Miracles</hi> done to <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test</hi> it; the wonderfull <hi>Conversion</hi> of the World by it, and the admirable <hi>Effects</hi> issuing from it; as the <hi>Sanctity</hi> of it's Professors that live up to it, the Heroick <hi>Sufferings</hi> of Martyrs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And, because 'tis a <hi>Supernatural Virtue,</hi> and, so, depends on God's <hi>Supernatural</hi> Influence as much as <hi>Natural Effects</hi> do on His <hi>Power</hi> as Author of <hi>Nature</hi>; hence, they consider it as introduc't by Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Dispositions <hi>inclining</hi> men to it, and God's Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Grace</hi> making them <hi>embrace</hi> it and <hi>adhere</hi> to it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly. On the other side, <hi>Controvertists,</hi> particularly <hi>We</hi> in our Modern Controversies, being to <hi>argue</hi> against those who <hi>admit</hi> whatever was taught by <hi>Christ</hi> to be <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> cannot possibly have the least occasion to treat of it as 'tis <hi>such,</hi> or use any of the former Arguments that are apt to <hi>prove</hi> it such; but accommodate our Discourses precisely to <hi>make out</hi> what those men <hi>deny</hi>; that is, the <hi>Grounds</hi> by which we come to know <hi>assuredly</hi> that these or those Points were taught by <hi>Christ.</hi> Much less do we consider Faith as it depends on the Workings of God's Holy Spirit, illuminating <hi>Interiourly</hi> the Souls of the Faithfull, and <hi>fixing</hi> them in their Faith; these being <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible</hi> and so Impossible to be brought into <hi>Arguments,</hi> or <hi>produc't</hi> against an Adversary in our Controversial Disputes. 2. That 'tis evident that in all my Books I am writing <hi>Controversies</hi>; and, consequently, writing of Faith precisely as <hi>'tis controverted</hi> between me and my
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44996:147"/>
Opposers: Which manifestly evinces that I treat of it under none of those Considerations <hi>School-Divines</hi> do; in regard none of my Adversaries, (at least professedly) <hi>deny</hi> it to be <hi>Divine,</hi> or that God's <hi>Grace</hi> is requisite to it. Nor can any man shew so much as <hi>One</hi> Argument in <hi>all</hi> my Books that looks that way. 3. That, since 'tis manifest beyond all Cavill that we are writing <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy,</hi> and consequently treating of <hi>Faith</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely as 'tis <hi>Controverted</hi>; and there are but Two Points that can be controverted in relation to the <hi>Evincing</hi> or <hi>Defending</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>Christian Faith</hi>: The one, that <hi>what Christ taught was Divine</hi>; the other, that <hi>Christ taught what we now believe</hi>; the Former of which being <hi>granted</hi> by <hi>all</hi> the Deserters of the Church, and therefore cannot possibly need to be <hi>Prov'd</hi> by Me, or any in my Circumstances; it follows evidently that the <hi>later</hi> Point is only that which can be debated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and my Adversaries; that is, we are only to treat of <hi>Faith</hi> as it stands under that Abstraction or Consideration; that is, as it stands under some certain Rule, securing us that it <hi>was taught by Christ</hi>; It being agreed on all hands, that, if he taught it, it <hi>Is Divine.</hi> 4. That tho' this and no other can with any sense be our Task, yet 'tis tedious to stand repeating at every turn this Abstracted Acception of <hi>Faith,</hi> as 'tis found or treated in our Controversies, or reiterating still this reduplication [<hi>as taught by Christ;</hi>] but 'tis enough to have exprest it at first in <hi>Prefaces,</hi> and the <hi>State of the Question,</hi> and afterwards upon occasion in many <hi>signal</hi> passages, which I did very punctually, as appears by my <note n="*" place="margin">See Clype<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex from. p. 151. to 194.</note> Defences, where I instanc't in Sixty three several places: I might say, I did it in <hi>whole Books,</hi> where I spoke in short, as is seen in my <note n="*" place="margin">Declaration p. 43.</note> 
                     <hi>Method</hi>; in which very small Treatise 'tis inculcated above twenty times. Whence, where-ever I use the single word [<hi>Faith</hi>] it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44996:148"/>
must necessarily mean <hi>Faith as Controverted,</hi> or, <hi>accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what is Controverted between us.</hi> Such a sollicitous Repetition would argue a distrust in me, that my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders wanted Common Sense; who could not reflect on what was <hi>in hand,</hi> or keep a heedfull eye upon what was <hi>at first,</hi> and <hi>once for all</hi> declar'd and <hi>signally exprest</hi> in those remarkable places. <hi>Lastly,</hi> That my treating of what Motives or Rule Christian Faith must <hi>have in it self,</hi> or in its own nature to make good its <hi>Truth,</hi> (which is <hi>Essential</hi> to it) as I did particularly in <hi>Faith Vindicated,</hi> does not exceed the bounds of Controversy, or treat of Faith as 'tis a Theological Virtue, or in any Consideration relating to it as <hi>such</hi>: for I still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press my self over and over in the <hi>Introduction</hi> to speak of its <hi>Rule,</hi> or of <hi>Faith,</hi> as proveable by its <hi>Rule</hi>; and tho' I do not <hi>there</hi> apply it against any Adversary, yet in the Inferences at the End I do this against Dr. <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotson</hi> and Himself, without any Reply for these Fifteen years: Nor, have they any Possible way to come off, but either, by answering <hi>Faith Vindicated,</hi> and shewing there needs no Absolutely Certain Rule to secure us of our having Christian Faith; or, by shewing that they have some Rule Absolutely securing those from Error who <hi>rely</hi> on it. The same <hi>Introduction,</hi> and the same Answer serves to show how Moral Certainty of the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this Rule <hi>is,</hi> and how it <hi>is not</hi> sufficient. For I declare my self <note n="*" place="margin">Faith Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. p. 18.</note> there <hi>to speak of the Nature of those Motives</hi> (or Rule) <hi>in themselves and as laid in Second Causes by Gods Providence to light Mankind in their way to Faith; to which the dimness of Eye-sight, neglect to look at all, or looking the wrong way, even in many particular men, is Extrinsical and Contingent.</hi> Moral Evidence then of the Rule of Faith's Certainty, nay, even less, may serve many particular men; for they are still <hi>secur'd from Errour,</hi> by adhering to what such a Rule delivers,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44996:148"/>
tho' they <hi>penetrate not</hi> the Grounds of its Certainty; with which it well consists that that <hi>Rule as laid by God to light</hi> or satisfy <hi>all Mankind,</hi> who are <hi>in their way to Faith,</hi> must be <hi>in it self</hi> more than Morally Certain, or <hi>must be impossible to be False</hi>; otherwise it <hi>could not</hi> perfectly satisfy acute Schollars that what it abets is <hi>True</hi>; nor enable Pastors and Learned men to defend the <hi>Truth</hi> of Faith as far as it depends on that Rule; nor <hi>Secure</hi> any man, Learned or Unlearned, from <hi>Erring</hi> in Faith; whereas, by being thus Absolutely Certain, it secures <hi>every man,</hi> tho' never so weak, from <hi>Errour</hi> while he <hi>follows</hi> it, and preserves inviolable the <hi>Truth</hi> of Faith it self.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This last Note fully answers his first <hi>pretended</hi> Contradiction,<note place="margin">P. 7.</note> that <hi>my Chief End in that Treatise (viz. Faith Vindicated)</hi> was to <hi>settle Christian Faith,</hi> and yet <hi>that I speak not of Faith in it self, but as it it controverted.</hi> For I no where meddle with Faith <hi>in it self,</hi> or as it is a Theological Virtue as School-Divines do, but meerly <hi>in order to my Opposers.</hi> With which may well consist, that I may write a Book to <hi>settle Christian Faith</hi> by shewing it must have a Certain Rule, <hi>before</hi> I apply it against my Adversaries, by shewing they have no such Rule, and so no Certainty of their Faith; as I did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Himself and Dr. <hi>T.</hi> at the End of that Book, and do peremptorily Challenge them to clear themselves of those <hi>Inferences,</hi> and <hi>prove</hi> themselves to be <hi>Holders of Christs Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Christians.</hi> An Instance will shew how weak this Cavil is. A Scrivener makes a Pen; and his Primary Intention, considering him, <hi>as he is doing that Action,</hi> is that the Pen should be a good one; and his writing taking him precisely as a Pen-maker was <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary</hi> and <hi>Occasional.</hi> And yet writing was for all that his <hi>Primary</hi> Intention as he was a <hi>Scrivener.</hi> Thus it past with me. My <hi>Main, Primary,</hi> and (if he will)
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44996:149"/>
                     <hi>precise</hi> End <hi>in that</hi> Treatise was to settle Christian Faith, by demonstrating it was to have a <hi>sure Foundation</hi>: and in this was terminated the particular design of that Book. Now, the doing this was apt to exclude all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Christianity, who had no such Grounds; but I did not this, till I had ended the Treatise, nor stood applying my Discourses, or <hi>striking my Opposer just then</hi> with the Weapon I was but a making. Which yet hinders not but the <hi>Primary End of</hi> writing that whole Treatise was <hi>in Order to my Opposers,</hi> tho' a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more <hi>remotely;</hi> and this is so Evident by my <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences</hi> at the End, that none but a Caviller, enrag'd that he could not answer them, would have made such an Objection.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <note place="margin">P. 8.</note>8. Hence his Second, which Equivocates in the word [<hi>Objects</hi>] is frivolous. For I no where treat of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or Mysteries of Faith <hi>in themselves,</hi> or say the Connexion of <hi>their</hi> Terms must be Evident; but only that the Certainty of the <hi>Humane Authority</hi> of the Church, which I make our <hi>Rule,</hi> to know they were taught by Christ, must be prov'd from the Objects or <hi>things without us, viz.</hi> the Nature of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and the Nature of the <hi>Motives</hi> laid to perpetuate Christs Doctrine. And I wonder at his Insincerity to alledge this: when I had particularly forestall'd it in my Introduction (<hi>p.</hi> 18.) and declar'd there once for all, that in the following Treatise I only spoke of the <hi>Motives to light Mankind in their way to Faith</hi>; Does he think the <hi>Mysteries of Faith</hi> are the <hi>Way to Faith</hi>? Or can he pretend that the <hi>State of the Question,</hi> exprest so carefully before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand in a <hi>Preface</hi> to signify my meaning throughout the whole Treatise following, is totally to be set aside and neglected; and that only single words pickt out, where for brevity's sake I did not constantly repeat it, are to give my true Sense? What impertinent Brab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44996:149"/>
is this? Again, <hi>p.</hi> 16.17. I no less punctually declare that I <note n="*" place="margin">Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Faith Vindicated. p. 16.17.</note> only treat of the <hi>Objects</hi> or <hi>Points of Faith,</hi> as their <hi>Truth</hi> depends on those <hi>Motives</hi> or <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> Yet all will not do to a man bent upon Cavill.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. My last Note, towards the End, let's him see clearly <hi>when,</hi> to <hi>whom,</hi> and <hi>how,</hi>

This and much more is laid out <hi>there</hi> at large; which prevents most of his Objections <hi>here.</hi> But no notice takes the good Dr. of it.

                     <note place="margin">P. 11.</note> which was by the Confession of both Parties <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Supernatural,</hi> and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son called so by me; but did not treat of it as thus quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or go about to <hi>prove</hi> it <hi>Divine</hi>; but prov'd it's Truth meerly as it depended on <hi>Humane Faith</hi> previous to it; and so, did only <hi>formally</hi> treat of that <hi>Humane Faith</hi> it self, on which the Knowledge of <hi>Divine Faith</hi> leans, and by which those coming to Divine Faith are rais'd up to it. Yet what hideous Outcries the Dr. makes here, that by my Doctrine <hi>we are to seek for the Certainty of Faith formally Divine</hi>; That I make <hi>Divine and Supernatural Faith derive it's Certainty from Natural Infallibility, &amp;c.</hi> Tho' he knows as well as that he lives that we make Faith as <hi>Formally Divine</hi> derive it's Certainty from the <hi>Divine Authority</hi> testify'd to us by <hi>Miracles</hi>; That this Establishment of Divine Faith by Supernatural means is presuppos'd to our Question and granted by both sides; and that our only Point is how we may know certainly what was this Divine Faith thus ascertain'd at first. Whoever reads <hi>Third Catholick Letter. p.</hi> 23.24. will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire with what face he could object these falshoods, or counterfeit an Ignorance of what has been so often and so clearly told him; and which he had seen so particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answer'd in my Defences: But this is his usual Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. 'Tis pretty to observe into what a monstrous piece of Nonsense our Dr. has fall'n here: and how because I argue <hi>from</hi> Supernatural Faith, he thinks I am arguing <hi>for</hi> it or <hi>proving</hi> it. Whereas common sense tells every man who has not laid it aside, that he who argues <hi>from</hi> another thing, <hi>supposes</hi> that other thing, and, so cannot

possibly, while he does so, go about to <hi>prove</hi> it, or <hi>treat</hi> of it. But it seems <hi>For</hi> and <hi>From</hi> are the same with his great Reason, and not possible to be distinguisht. He might have seen other <note n="*" place="margin">Faith Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated.

His 7th Exception is answer'd in my last Note; which shews that the Ground upon which the <hi>Truth</hi> of Faith depends must be <hi>more than Morally Certain;</hi> tho' every Believer needs not penetrate the force of those Grounds, or have even <hi>so much as Moral Certainty</hi> of their Conclusiveness. But, what means he when he <hi>Objects</hi> my saying, that, <hi>True Faith, by reason of its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Grounds can bear an asserting the Impossibility of it's Falshood</hi>? Can this man do himself a greater preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, than by <hi>thus</hi> confessing, that he holds not Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, <hi>absolutely</hi> speaking, <hi>True?</hi> Or can he lay a greater scandal on <hi>Christian Faith</hi> it self, than to quarrel at a Position that can give him no displeasure, but by as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting it's <hi>perfect Truth</hi>? If this do not like his new-fashion'd Christian Principles, I suppose he will own the contrary Position, and affirm that <hi>True Faith, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it's Moveable</hi> (or <hi>Uncertain) Grounds, Cannot bear an asserting the Absolute Impossibility of it's Falshood</hi>; And this is in plain terms to assert, that <hi>absolutely speaking, True Faith may all be False:</hi> which is both <hi>Unchristian,</hi> and <hi>strong Nonsense</hi> to boot. He should have Preach't this to his Auditory at <hi>Guildhall</hi>; and then he should have seen how every honest Hearer, would have abhorr'd his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, have lookt upon Him as scarce <hi>half a Christian,</hi> and on such a Faith as <hi>absurd, praeternatural, and Irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> as well as I did.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. These are the greatest Contradictions the Dr. could pick even out of an Adversaries Book; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which he keeps such a <hi>mighty noise, blusters</hi> and <hi>triumphs.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 14.15.</note> He tells the Reader, I affirm that <hi>Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty destroys the Essence of Faith.</hi> And I affirm it does, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Faith without some absolutely certain Principle, as Demonstration is, to ground it on.

                     <hi>True;</hi> and it cannot be <hi>True</hi> to those who <hi>see</hi> that, notwithstanding it's Grounds which are to prove it <hi>Christ</hi>'s Doctrine, it <hi>may</hi> yet be <hi>none</hi> of his Doctrine.

As for the three Propositions pickt out of my Books apart from the Context, and which, <hi>as</hi> taken in the <hi>precise words</hi> in which they were exhibited, were cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd: I desire the Reader to reflect, that these words [<hi>There is no God</hi>] tho' found in the Holy Scripture it self, yet <hi>as separated</hi> from the words adjoyning, and exprest

This was my very case. The words or passages taken <hi>alone,</hi> without the <hi>Prefaces,</hi> declaring the sole <hi>Intent</hi> of the Author, without the <hi>State of the Question,</hi> and <hi>other</hi> Paragraphs (or words in the same Paragraph) giving light, by the Tenour of the Discourse, to my true meaning, bore a shew as if I had affirm'd that it was requisite to Faith to demonstrate the <hi>Mysteries of Faith,</hi> and among them the <hi>Supernatural</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Church, which is a <hi>Point of Faith.</hi> Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since there was inserted by the Exhibiter a <hi>Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi> in the middle of the second Proposition, [<hi>he speaks of Propositions of Faith</hi>] whereas there was not a word of any such thing, but about <note place="margin">Vindiciae J.

in their Sense.</hi> Now, not one word is there in those <hi>Letters</hi> which is the Sense Condemn'd, as I shew'd lately; however I am glad he who has still been so high against all Infallibility in his Writings, and deny'd it to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, or any <hi>Church,</hi> owns it at least in <hi>Himself.</hi> I see now what Grounds he went upon when he would not make a Candid <hi>Retractation</hi> of his <hi>Irenicum.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly this man would persuade us to take his word for our <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> But the ill luck, is his Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is evidently prov'd already to be willfull Forgery, against plain and Authentick matter of Fact.

Whence we may judge of our Drs. sincerity: In his Second Letter to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> p. 8. by putting <hi>Heresis Blacloana</hi> in the Margent over against his Appeal to <hi>F.

Beat off from that False and Ungrounded pretence, he has found us another Author for it; and I expect in his next piece we shall have a Third or Fourth; according as his fancy, so heated now that it has shaken off all regard to Civility, shall prompt him. Again, he shews us how wonderfully ingenuous he is, by his quoting against me the railing Book of an unknown Adversary, which had besides all the Marks of a Libel in it; and over-flipping the Attestation of Eight Worthy Divines of great repute; who, openly and <hi>owning their names,</hi> did witness that those <hi>places,</hi> in my Books, did not bear the <hi>Sense</hi> in which those words <hi>pick't out</hi> thence were

censur'd. Add that Dr. <hi>St. knew</hi> all these particulars were clear'd satisfactorily, since it appears (by his quoting them) he had read my <hi>Defences,</hi> in which they are <hi>printed at large.</hi> Which Common Sense may assure him I durst not have done, in the Life-time of all the Persons mention'd and concern'd, without quite losing my Cause; Nay I should have expos'd my self to new Accusations as a Falsifier, had I not dealt sincerely to a tittle, and preserv'd all the Authentick Originals in my own hands, for the Justification of my <hi>Defences,</hi> which I yet have.

He read it, and at my request made his Exceptions; which being clear'd by me, he askt me why I did not Print it? I reply'd I would, so his <hi>Grandeur</hi> would please to give me leave to Dedicate it to himself. Which obtain'd, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44996:156"/>
to the <hi>Sorbon</hi> for their Approbation of it, the former of them (Monsieur <hi>Pirot</hi>) testifying <hi>it contain'd nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Faith or good manners,</hi> &amp; the later of them (Dr <hi>Gage</hi>) added that <hi>the most certain Rule of Faith was in that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise exactly settled and invincibly defended.</hi> But still obscure <hi>Lominus</hi> is worth twenty <hi>Sorbons</hi> in Dr. <hi>St's.</hi> Learned Judgment.

                  <p n="20">20. I alledge in the Fourth place the Testimony of my Superiour here in <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>Humphry Ellice,</hi> an Ancient Dr. and Professor of Divinity, and late Dean of our Catholick Chapter; whose Sanctity of Life and solid Judgment gave him a high Esteem with all that knew him. This Grave and Venerable Person, besides the Ordinary and Customary Approbation of my Books, added that <hi>They do clearly demonstrate, out of the very nature of Ecclesiastical Tradition, that the Doctrin delivered by Christ and his Apostles, was inviolably eonserv'd in the Roman-Catholick and Apostolick Church even to this Age in which we now live; and by Irrefragable force of Reason did evidently convince the Grounds of the Hereticks</hi> (meaning Dr. <hi>St.</hi> and Dr. <hi>Till.</hi> against whom I had writ) <hi>to be meer Tricks and vain Fallacies.</hi> But still <hi>Lominus</hi> (that is the Lord knows who) is Dr. <hi>St's.</hi> only <hi>Saint</hi> and Infallible <hi>Oracle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. It were not amiss to add next the Testimony or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judgment of that deservedly Esteemed, and Learned man, Mr. <hi>R. H.</hi> Author of The <hi>Guide of Controversy.</hi> This Excellent Writer, though he inclines rather to the School-opinion of the sufficiency of Moral Certainty, yet, like a truly ingenuous and Charitable man, preferring the Common Good of Christianity before his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Sentiment, after having discourst according to his own Grounds, he, in allusion to my way of proceeding,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44996:156"/>
subjoyns these words: [<hi>But then, if any, after all this, can make good any farther Certainty in such Tradition; I know no Party, if Christian, that has any Interest to oppose him — The stronger any one can make this Faith, they have all reason to like it the better.</hi>] By which 'tis apparent that he is so far from <hi>condemning</hi> and <hi>censuring</hi> the way I take, that he declares 'tis <hi>not the Interest of any Party, if Christian,</hi> to oppose it; and that himself and every one ought to <hi>like it better</hi> than the other way, so <hi>it could be made good.</hi> And, that it <hi>can,</hi> my best Reason tells me; since, as appears by my <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi> it has born the Test of being reduc't even to <hi>Self-Evidence;</hi> and the miserable shifts and Evasions, to which the most Learned of our Adversaries are driven, to avoid it's force, do more and more assure me 'tis not at all hard to compass it.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. In the last place, to omit many others, I shall put the Testimony of that very Reverend Person F. <hi>Martin Harney,</hi> Dr. of Divinity of the University of <hi>Lovain,</hi> and Principal Regent of the General Studies of the Order of St <hi>Dominick</hi>: Who being askt at <hi>Rome</hi> (where he was at the time of the Contest) his Judgment of my Doctrin, compriz'd in my <hi>Method,</hi> and of the Sense of the three Propositions, as they lie in my Books, gave under his hand this Testimonial of both. <hi>I under-written have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively read the</hi> Method <hi>writ by Mr</hi> John Sergeant, <hi>and his Vindication of the three Propositions pickt out of his Books; and I have found that the Method is sound Doctrin, and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to reduce many to the Catholick Faith. And in his</hi> Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciae <hi>'tis plainly demonstrated that the foresaid Propositions, as written by the Author, do make a Sense altogether Orthodox.</hi> This Reverend Person I had never seen, nor heard of; nor could any thing but the love of Truth move him to this Approbation; nay, he must have lost much Credit with the <hi>Sacra Congregatio,</hi> had my Doctrin been prov'd <hi>Vnorthodox,</hi> or the Propositions in my Book, (as <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> affirms) <hi>Heretical.</hi>

                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:44996:157"/>23. Modesty forbids me to mention the excessive <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums</hi> of that Eminent Controvertist Mr. <hi>Edward Worsley,</hi> a Father of the Society; who, though utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me, took such a Friendship for me upon the reading my Books, and in all places where he came ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd my poor Endeavours with such immoderate Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, that to save my blushes in rehearsing them I intreat those who have the Curiosity to read them in my <hi>Declaratio</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 73. to <hi>p.</hi> 78. I shew'd them to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Castlemain,</hi> who was pleas'd to do me the right to attest them to be his hand-writing. The same noble Personage &amp; as many as knew F. <hi>Worsley,</hi> will, I doubt not, do that right to his Memory, as to witness for him that as he was Second to none in abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to distinguish between Sound and Tainted Doctrine; so his sincere Candour and Integrity set him as far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the humour of Flattery, as my Meanness could incline any to it.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. The Sum of my present Defence is this. Eight Divines of great Repute appointed by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and admitted by my Adversary himself, do unanimously attest that <hi>the Sense condemn'd</hi> is <hi>not</hi> in my Books, but the <hi>contrary.</hi> My Judge <hi>clears</hi> me, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers are <hi>commanded</hi> to make me Satisfaction. The Highest Tribunal <hi>allows</hi> my Plea, and <hi>acquits</hi> me. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, Arch-Bishops, Bishops, the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> Eminent Divines, and even those who take another way in their Writings, approve and commend my Doctrine, and most of them in very high and extraordinary expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; my own Superiour does the same; nay even those, who were formerly highly prejudic't, declar'd themselves satisfy'd in it. So that poor Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is left alone to ballance against all this weighty Authority, with one <hi>Lominus,</hi> a meer <hi>Utopian,</hi> or <hi>Man in the Moon;</hi> on whose sole <hi>no-Authority</hi> he grounds all his sensless
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44996:157"/>
Calumnies. Was ever weak man so baffled! Add, that he <hi>knew</hi> that all these <hi>Defences</hi> of mine had been <hi>made</hi> and <hi>accepted</hi> many years ago, and those Authorities <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd,</hi> and my Doctrine thus <hi>approv'd</hi> and <hi>clear'd;</hi> yet he had not the Candour to let his Reader have the least hint of any of those particulars; which argues not too great <hi>love of Moral Honesty.</hi> Nor does he take off any <hi>one</hi> Answer of those <hi>many</hi> I had given; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly says over again rawly some few things objected, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to, and printed fourteen Years ago; and plays up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a double-sens't word or two by applying them still to wrong Subjects. which is in effect to tell the Reader he must either talk insignificantly against evident matter of Fact, or say just nothing, and to confess in plain terms he is at a perfect <hi>Nonplus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="25">25. To close this present business I desire the Reader to reflect that those Judges, Approvers and Commenders of my Books and Doctrine, liv'd generally in divers and far-distant Nations, were of different Faculties and Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities, of different Education, different Orders, and (to some degree) of different Principles and Interests; some of them of slight acquaintance; divers utterly unknown to me, or I to Them. So that, 'tis impossible to imagine that any thing but the <hi>Force of Truth</hi> and the <hi>Integrity</hi> of my way of proving the Certainty of our Faith as to it's being taught by <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> could make them conspire to allow or abet my Writings so heartily and unanimous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Nor could there be any Human inducements to make them so partial to a private man every way inconsidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of no Esteem at all but what my Writings and Principles gave me. Whence, though <hi>no one Church,</hi> as Dr. <hi>St.</hi> weakly objects, has ever <hi>own'd my Doctrine</hi> (to give formal Approbations of Controversial or Theological Writings not being a work proper for <hi>Churches</hi>) yet, the Dignity of the Persons and all these Circumstances con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44996:158"/>
I conceive it may amount to the full weight of the Judgment of any <hi>one</hi> particular Church whatsoever, that my Doctrin is Sound and Orthodox. Nor will he, I believe, find that any work of a particular Writer hath had more Authentick Testimonials for it, than my poor Endeavours have had; except that of the never-enough-praised, the Bishop of <hi>Condom.</hi> And 'tis not the least Confirmation of their Integrity that they have been twice brought to the Tryal, (at <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>) and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unsound found in them. Though I must do the Doctor the right to acknowledge he has spoke <hi>one</hi> (and hitherto <hi>but one</hi>) true word: but he is to be pardon'd for prevaricating from his constant method of speaking Falshoods, for it was at unawares, and he knew not he did so; The Truth he spoke against his will was this, <hi>That I hardly escaped Censure at</hi> Rome: and therefore, to make his words good, I'le tell him how it was. All my Books were sent thither to Cardinal <hi>Barberin;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them one written by the Right Honourable my Lord Chancellour <hi>Hyde,</hi> in defence of Dr. <hi>St.</hi> against Mr. <hi>Cressy;</hi> pretending (the Title of this last being torn out) they were all writ by the same Author, <hi>my self;</hi> There went with them a desire to His Eminency, that, not to give them the trouble of Perusing them All, he would cause only <hi>this last</hi> of my Lord Chancellour's to be read; and, by the Character he receiv'd of <hi>that,</hi> to judge whether <hi>all the rest</hi> writ by that Author ought not to be <hi>Condemn'd.</hi> He gave them to an English Divine to keep, who knew nothing of the Contest; ordering him to read only <hi>That,</hi> and give him a faithfull account of it as soon as he could. While he was reading it, God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence so order'd it, that an <hi>English</hi> Gentleman, his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, came accidentally into his Chamber, and finding all my Books on his Table, askt how they came there? He, hearing <hi>mee</hi> nam'd as their Author, admir'd,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44996:158"/>
and said he could not believe they were <hi>mine;</hi> in regard he had heard I was a Writer for Catholick Faith; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as this Author was of far other Principles. After some perusing it, my Friend found it was my Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour's Book foisted in for one of mine. Which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by my Friend's Testimony and the finding all the other Books to run in a quite different strain, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Protectour of the <hi>Fourbe</hi> that was put upon him, and so my poor Books escapt scot-free. By this or some such Stratagem they might perhaps have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd, but that there was any danger of it when my Defences were seen and compar'd with the Accusations, <hi>Infallible</hi> Dr. <hi>St.</hi> is the first man that ever inform'd us. But, what would we have from a man that can scarce speak a word of liquid Truth!</p>
                  <p n="26">26. But, tho' Dr. <hi>St.</hi> has neither manag'd this invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Cavil <hi>Solidly,</hi> nor (he must pardon me) <hi>honestly</hi> or justly, according to any <hi>Moral Honesty</hi> but his own, which he has told us he so <hi>loves</hi>: Has he at least deserv'd the Commendation given to the <hi>Vnjust Steward;</hi> has he done <hi>wisely,</hi> or, in any degree, <hi>prudently</hi>?

But, tho' they were over civil to him, why had not he the Goodness by a voluntary Recantation to give a stop to the spreading that contagious Doctrin, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he did not hold it still?

                  <head>SECT. II. How Dr. <hi>St.</hi> settles the true State of the Controversy.</head>
                  <p n="28">28. I Have been longer about this First Section than seem'd needfull. But the Influence it has upon our future Dispute will recompence my trouble, and excuse my Prolixity. The Second thing his <hi>Method</hi> leads him to (for hitherto it has led him quite out of the way) is <hi>to state the Controversy.</hi> And to this end, he acquaints us with the <hi>Occasion of the Conference</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 15.</note> which was that Mr. <hi>G. affirm'd in some company that no Protestant could shew any Ground of Absolute Certainty for their Faith; and that Mr.</hi> T. <hi>had promis'd him that if Dr.</hi> St. <hi>were not able to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the contrary, he would forsake his Communion.</hi> Will the Dr hold to these words? 'Tis plain here that Mr <hi>G. demanded</hi> he should <hi>shew</hi> Grounds to ascertain his Faith absolutely. Mr. <hi>T. expected</hi> he should <hi>manifest</hi> they had such Grounds as <hi>did</hi> ascertain their Faith; and, if he <hi>could not,</hi> was to leave his Communion: Lastly, that Dr. <hi>St.</hi> by accepting the Challenge, became engag'd to satisfy Mr <hi>T's.</hi> expectation, and to <hi>manifest the contrary</hi> to what Mr <hi>G.</hi> had asserted; that is to <hi>manifest</hi> he had <hi>Grounds of Absolute Certainty for his Faith;</hi> or, (which comes to the same) for <hi>Christian Faith</hi> upon his Grounds
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44996:161"/>
being taught by <hi>Christ.</hi> And, how did the Dr. acquit himself, and perform this? Why, he assign'd <hi>Scripture</hi> for the Ground or Rule of his Faith, and <hi>Universal Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> for the <hi>Proof</hi> of the <hi>Books of Scripture.</hi> All the company knew this before. For, both sides <hi>knew, held</hi> and <hi>granted</hi> already that the Book of Scripture was prov'd by Universal Tradition, and every one knew too that Dr <hi>St.</hi> would assign <hi>It</hi> for the <hi>Ground</hi> or <hi>Rule</hi> of his Faith. Wherefore, unless all the company were out of their Wits, surely something more was expected; and what could <hi>that</hi> be, but that he should manifest his <hi>Faith</hi> was <hi>absolutely Certain</hi> by relying on that Rule, or that the Rule he assign'd, gave <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>his,</hi> Absolute Certainty of their <hi>Faith,</hi> or of those <hi>Tenets</hi> which they held upon it. For, it being agreed on both sides that the <hi>Sense of the Scripture</hi> was <hi>in it self</hi> True Faith, Gods Word, and as such to be embrac't, the only Question was of the <hi>sense of Scripture as to us,</hi> or <hi>as to our knowledge of it:</hi> And of <hi>This</hi> the Dr was to shew and manifest he had Absolute Certainty by any way <hi>his</hi> Grounds afforded him; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, he might <hi>fall short</hi> or be <hi>wrong</hi> in the knowing Scriptures <hi>Sense</hi> (that is, in his <hi>Faith</hi>) tho' the <hi>Letter</hi> were never so Certain. Again, by his <hi>counterposing</hi> to those words of his [<hi>than you can have for the points in difference between us</hi>] 'tis manifest the contest was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had Absolute Certainty of those <hi>Points</hi> he held upon <hi>his</hi> Rule. What says the Dr now to this plain <hi>state of the Controversy</hi>?</p>
                  <p n="29">29. First he changes <hi>the Ground of Absolute Certainty for his Faith</hi> into proving the <hi>Absolute Certainty of the Ground or Rule of his Faith</hi>:<note place="margin">P. 15. l. 32. ult. &amp; p. 16. l. 1.2.</note> which transposes the Terms of the Question, and alters the whole business. For <hi>Absolute Certainty for Faith</hi> engages him to shew the <hi>Doctrin</hi> or <hi>Tenets</hi> of Faith to be thus Certain; whereas [<hi>Absolute Certainty of the Rule of our Faith</hi>] makes <hi>Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44996:162"/>
affect the <hi>Rule,</hi> but leaves all Faith Uncertain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the pretended Rule proves a good one, and renders the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of Christian Faith, consisting of many <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Points, thus Absolutely Certain; which himself will tell us afterwards, he will not stand to. Next, he Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates in the word [<hi>Scripture</hi>] which may either mean the <hi>Letter,</hi> or the <hi>Sense</hi> of it. Now the <hi>Sense</hi> of it being <hi>Faith,</hi> 'tis <hi>That</hi> only could be meant by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> and of which it was affirmed he could not shew Grounds ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely ascertaining it; The <hi>Sense,</hi> I say, of Scripture, could only be <hi>question'd</hi> since the Letter was <hi>agreed to.</hi> Wherefore to alledge <hi>Tradition</hi> for his Proof of what his Grounds will not allow to it, <hi>viz.</hi> to bring down the <hi>Sense</hi> of Scripture or Faith, and turn it off to the shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Certainty of the Letter, which was out of Question, is a most palpable prevarication. 3. He quite forgets to shew that <hi>any</hi> Point <hi>of his</hi> Faith or <hi>all</hi> of it, (speaking of the Controverted or Dogmatical Points as we do) may not be <hi>False,</hi> notwithstanding his Proof for the Certainty of its <hi>Letter</hi>: which if it be, 'tis not <hi>Faith</hi>; unless he will say the Points of his <hi>Faith</hi> may be so many <hi>Untruths.</hi> 4. It has been prest upon him over and over in <note n="*" place="margin">First Cath. Letter. p. 22. Third Cath. Letter. p. 66.67.68.69.</note> my Catholick Letters to shew how his Rule influences his Assent of Faith with Absolute Certainty. It has been inculcated to him how both [<hi>Rule</hi>] and [<hi>Ground</hi>] are <hi>Relative</hi> words; and, therefore, that he could not pretend they were <hi>to him</hi> Absolutely Certain <hi>Grounds</hi> for his Faith, unless he shew'd how they made him Absolutely Certain of that <hi>Faith</hi> of his, which was the <hi>Correlate.</hi> Which tho' the most material Point, and most strongly prest upon him, he takes no notice of in his whole Reply; and it shall be seen that, when he comes to touch upon that Point (after his fashion) hereafter, he is forc't to confess they are <hi>no</hi> Absolutely Certain Ground or Rule to him at all. Lastly, that, when (<hi>Faith</hi> being
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44996:162"/>
                     <hi>Truth</hi>) the Question was whether he had any such Ground as could <hi>conclude</hi> it <hi>True</hi> that Christ had taught his Faith, and consequently whether he has <hi>any Faith at all</hi>; he slips over <hi>That,</hi> and rambles into a Discourse about <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> Faith in Scripture, instead of shewing he had <hi>any.</hi> Other shifts he has, but <hi>these</hi> are his master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieces: So that his whole performance, as to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, amounted to no more, than to take up the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his hand, and cry aloud [<hi>Look ye, Gentlemen, here is my Ground or Rule of Faith; and your selves must confess 'tis Absolutely Certain; and, therefore, you cannot deny but I have shewn you the Ground of Absolute Certainty for my Faith.</hi>] But if it should be reply'd: <hi>Sr, an Arian or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian might do the same, and yet no by-stander be the wiser for it, or more able to discern which of you</hi> has <hi>Christs true Faith, which</hi> not; <hi>in regard that must be decided by shewing who has an Absolutely Certain Means to know the true Sense of the Letter</hi>; the Drs insignificant Principles carry no farther, but (as we shall see anon) to confess plainly neither of them have <hi>any</hi> such Means of Absolute Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty <hi>at all.</hi> And that he cannot <hi>manifest</hi> what was <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected</hi> of him and he stood engag'd to <hi>manifest.</hi>

And why should not the Proposer fear, as himself did here, lest by changing his words, as he did enormously, he should change his Sense too? But this Orall Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like a Spright so haunts his Fancy, that all along (as shall be seen) he either <hi>starts</hi> perpetually into Excursions and counterfeit Mirth, or <hi>stumbles</hi> into downright Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense. And this I believe verily is the <hi>General</hi> reason of all his failings: But we are now to seek out his <hi>particular</hi> reason of changing the words here. The last words that differ in the Question and Answer can break no squares, for <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles agreed well enough; and that Heavenly Master of theirs taught them <hi>All Faith</hi> either by Himself or the Holy Ghost sent <hi>in his name.</hi> The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then must be in these words [<hi>the same Tenets in Faith</hi>]
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44996:164"/>
which he changes, for his security, into [<hi>the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin.</hi>] Because the word [<hi>Doctrin</hi>] signifies all <hi>in the lump</hi> (as <note n="*" place="margin">Second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Mr. G. p. 17.</note> he expresses it) to shew which he hop't it might be sufficient to shew the Book of Scripture; whereas the Plural word [<hi>Tenets</hi>] might come to oblige him to shew <hi>how</hi> he has Absolute Certainty of <hi>each</hi> or <hi>any</hi> Point in particular, to which he has a great Antipathy. And, accordingly, when he came to perform this, he <hi>chang'd</hi> again the Absolute Certainty <hi>of Faith</hi> into Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Certainty <hi>of Scripture.</hi> I answer'd. They held <hi>more</hi> to be of Faith than that the <hi>Book so call'd is Scripture.</hi> He first trifles that we mean <hi>more than is contain'd in Scripture,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P 21.</note> contrary to our express words, where there's not a Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable of <hi>containing</hi> or <hi>not-containing</hi> all Faith. However, <hi>if I mean</hi> his <hi>assent to Points of Faith contain'd in Scripture,</hi> he promises a <hi>full Answer afterwards:</hi> which we impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently long to see. Only we intreat him, because 'tis a far off, he would not lose <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> by the way; nor fool our expectations when we come at it, by letting the <hi>full Answer</hi> promist us, vanish away into a <hi>flat denial</hi> he has any <hi>such</hi> Certainty of those Points at all.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. I argu'd <hi>ad hominem</hi> that,<note place="margin">P. 23.</note> since he confesses <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on causes Certainty, it makes Faith as Certain as Scripture:</hi> He seems to confess it; but denies <hi>we have such an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Tradition for our Tridentin Faith.</hi> As if the Faith come down by Tradition were not the same <hi>before</hi> and <hi>since</hi> that Council; or that the Tradition we build on did not consist of such a vast Body of Attesters as were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to evince the truth of a plain matter of Fact, unless those who had renounc't Tradition did club to it's Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. But is it not pretty to observe that he pretends not to hold Faith to be Certain by our Tradition because 'tis <hi>not</hi> Universal, and yet at the same time disputes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Tradition's being a Certain Deriver of <hi>Christ's</hi> Faith even <hi>tho' it were</hi> Universal! For, his Principles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

no more hand in our Faith to Universal Tradition, but only to bring down the <hi>Book of Scripture,</hi> and then make that Book the <hi>only</hi> Ascertainer of our Faith. He threatens to shew the Tridentin Council had not Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Tradition for it's Decrees; and to give us a taste before-hand of that Treatise, he adds, <hi>Let the matter of Tradition it self, as a Rule of Faith, be one of those Points.</hi> Well shot Doctor! The Points he speaks of here are <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest</hi> to be Points of <hi>Faith;</hi> and the Tradition we defend in our Controversy at present is the <hi>Human</hi> Authority of the Church, which we make to be the <hi>Rule</hi> to those <hi>coming to Faith;</hi> and so it is <hi>Antecedent</hi> to Faith and the Object of pure <hi>Natural Reason</hi>: And does he in his Great Learning think <hi>This</hi> is a <hi>Point of Faith</hi>? Or is it not possible to keep this roving Pen of his to any thing?

his Rule to be a <hi>Qualifying</hi> Principle, which is to give his Faith <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> to the making it a <hi>Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Measure</hi> shewing what's Faith what not, or <hi>how much</hi> is of Faith.

By this Discourse the <hi>Arians</hi> and most of the Hereticks since Christs time held the <hi>Same</hi> Doctrin he taught; for they all held the Scripture's Letter to be <hi>Certain,</hi> and that it contain'd their Faith; yet tell him this a hundred times over, and demand <hi>how</hi> this is a <hi>particular</hi> Rule for <hi>his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> which is a <hi>Common</hi> one to all <hi>Hereticks,</hi> he is still deaf on that ear.

it All to be True,</hi> and that none of the Tenets <hi>he holds</hi> to be in Scripture are <hi>Hereticall.</hi> But he thanks you he'll not burn his fingers with handling such <hi>hot</hi> Points.

                     <note place="margin">P. 26.</note> But ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to our Point 'tis as wide from the purpose as what's most.

And 'tis to be remark't, that all Dr <hi>St's</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, Parallells and Similitudes which show prettily and look fine and glossy, when they come to be apply'd to the true Point, do still miss of being sutable in those very particulars which are only to the purpose.</p>

                     <note place="margin">P. 27.</note> to which he promis'd a full <hi>Answer</hi> formerly.

Yet he not only <hi>says</hi> it, but will <hi>prove</hi> it too from a Jew's having <hi>Absolute Certainty of all contain'd in the Books of</hi> Moses, <hi>and yet not having it as to

such a particular point, viz.</hi> the <hi>Resurrection.</hi> I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know if that point be <hi>contain'd</hi> in those Books?

And this he may have by the Testimony for these Books, tho' he can neither <hi>read,</hi> nor <hi>understand,</hi> nor ever <hi>heard</hi> read any one word in them: And has not this Man an incomparable <hi>Certainty of his Faith,</hi> that knows <hi>no Faith at all</hi>? Is not this to make a man Absolutely Certain of <hi>he knows not what</hi>? Yet, this it seems is all the Resolution of Dr. <hi>St's</hi> Faith.

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44996:169"/>
Apostles</hi>? 2. He is Absolutely Certain of <hi>his Rule,</hi> and it's <hi>containing all necessary Points.</hi> And what's he the better for Certainty of <hi>This,</hi> if still he remains uncertain of <hi>all</hi> the <hi>particular</hi> Articles he is to believe by it? 3. That God's Grace is requisit to <hi>Faith</hi> formally <hi>Divine;</hi> which is granted: but what's this to the <hi>proving</hi> it by a Natural <hi>Medium</hi> to have come from <hi>Christ,</hi> as he must do to those who are in the <hi>Way</hi> to Faith? Conclusive Evidence must be produc't for this, or the Proof must fall short of <hi>concluding</hi> (whether we have <hi>Grace</hi> or no) and so leave it <hi>Unprov'd</hi> and <hi>Uncertain.</hi> 4. He says, <hi>Particular Points of Faith are more or less Certain, according to the Evidence of their Deduction from Scripture as the Rule of Faith.</hi> This only seems to touch the Point in hand, and it touches it very gingerly. Let him speak out and tell us whether he is <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> of all particulars of his Faith, nay even of a Trinity and <hi>Christ</hi>'s Godhead <hi>by his Rule;</hi> or whether <hi>any man living</hi> is absolutely Certain of them by <hi>his</hi> Principles? If not, then all Faith may be a Lying Story for any thing he or any man else can tell. And that this is his true Tenet is evident by his omitting <note place="margin">P. 33. l. 12. &amp; 16.</note> here when he comes to speak of Particular Points, the words [<hi>Absolutely Certain</hi>] which he put to the two first parts of his Division. Nor do I like his expression of [<hi>more or less Certain</hi>] for since any Quality is <hi>more or less such,</hi> by having <hi>less or more</hi> of the Opposit Quality mixt with it, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that this his [<hi>more or less Certain</hi>] must mean [<hi>less or more Uncertain</hi>] strange Language for a Christian to use when he is speaking of <hi>All the Particular Articles of his Faith,</hi> and what Certainty is to be allow'd for them! And yet he calls this, the <hi>setting this Controversy about the Certainty of Faith in it's true light.</hi>

                  <head>SECT III. How Dr. <hi>St.</hi> Answers Our Reasons produc't against his Grounds of Certainty for his Faith.</head>
                  <p n="39">39. HE proceeds next to answer my <hi>short Discourse</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating that He, and those of His Principles, could not be <hi>Sure</hi> they had right Faith. I presum'd he <hi>could not do it;</hi> he says he <hi>has;</hi> Let's see which of us is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed. It consists of five plain Propositions. 1. <hi>God has left us some Way to know surely what</hi> Christ <hi>and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles taught.</hi> 2. <hi>Therefore this Way must be such that they who take it, shall arrive by it at the End it was intended for; that is know surely what</hi> Christ <hi>and his Apostles taught.</hi> 3. <hi>Scripture's Letter Interpretable by Private Iudgments, is not that Way; for we experience Presbyterians and Socinians</hi> (for example) <hi>both take that Way, yet differ in such high Fundamentals, as the Trinity &amp; Godhead of</hi> Christ. 4. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Scripture's Letter Interpretable by Private Iudgments, is not the Way left by God to know surely what</hi> Christ <hi>and his Apostles taught, or surely to arrive at right Faith.</hi> 5. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they who take only That Way, cannot by it arrive surely at right Faith; since 'tis impossible to arrive at the End, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Means or Way that leads to it.</hi> The Reader may know that this very Discourse, in substance, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to him many years ago by a Worthy Lady, of whose sincerity I believe himself does not doubt. He made a rambling Discourse of his own against it, unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to any Proposition in it. The Lady, having a high opinion of Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s parts, judg'd it impossible a man of his Learning should not be able to give an Answer to a few Lines in so long a time; not reflecting how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected Truth hampers an Adversary, and is perfectly
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44996:170"/>
Unanswerable: So she prest vehemently for a Second &amp; a Distinct Answer. After some tedious expectation he sends another, more insignificant, if possible, than the former. Which seen, and the Lady now satisfied that he (upon whom she most rely'd) had done his utmost, she alter'd her Judgment; upon no other inducement than the seeing plainly that his Principles resolv'd all Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith finally into the Private Spirit: The Drs <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecter</hi> was set on, like an unexperienc't <hi>Perdu</hi> Souldier, to combat it with a <hi>distinct</hi> Answer: but alas!<note place="margin">P. 16.17. &amp;c.</note> he was shown to falter or falsify in every particular. This ill suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, made the Dr. grow wary in speaking to any <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> part of it; but thought it safest here to stand aloof, and throw stones <hi>at distance,</hi> instead of grappling with it <hi>neerer hand.</hi> His answer is, that it proceeds upon two <hi>False Suppositions,</hi> and <hi>Overthrows the Possibility of any Rule of Faith.</hi> My first False Supposition is,<note place="margin">P. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>that there is no Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty without Infallibility.</hi> No <hi>True</hi> or <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> good Dr. For, as for <hi>your</hi> Morall Certainty it may be <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible</hi> enough. I must confess I hate such nonsense as to say [<hi>I am perfectly Certain of a thing yet peradventure I am deciev'd.</hi>] The word [<hi>Absolute</hi>] signifies <hi>Perfect;</hi> and <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> if <hi>True,</hi> is taken from the Natures of the <hi>Objects</hi> or <hi>Things without us;</hi> and if they stand <hi>perfectly</hi> engag'd by a True <hi>Knowledge</hi> of them, they would <hi>not be</hi> what they <hi>are,</hi> if when we truly conceive them <hi>as they are,</hi> our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or <hi>Iudgment</hi> of them <hi>can be False,</hi> that is, if it be not, in that particular, <hi>Infallible.</hi> This is plain Sense, and told him long ago. It has been demonstrated also in <note place="margin">P. 36.37.</note> 
                     <hi>Faith Vindicated</hi> that <hi>True Certainty</hi> &amp; <hi>Infallibility</hi> were all one. What answers he? Why, he makes as if he had never known or heard of our Arguments for it; but falls to talk of the <note place="margin">P. 35. P. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>Stoicks Marke, Epicurus</hi> his fooleries: He learnedly mistakes the Definition, [<hi>Man is a Rational Creature</hi>] for a <hi>Demonstration,</hi> and dislikes it at the same

time. Lastly, he tells us many other things the Antients held or said; which are nothing to me, who judge I know what belongs to <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>resolving of Truths</hi> into their <hi>Principles,</hi> as well as they did; and do think them very weak to stand disputing with the perfect Scepticks or convincing them by <hi>Criterions;</hi> because all Discourse supposes something <hi>Certain</hi> to build upon, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it might go on <hi>endlessly;</hi> that is, would be <hi>to no End;</hi> and the Scepticks admitted no Certainty of <hi>any thing at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="40">40. His Application of those Preparatives is, that we are to expect <hi>no</hi> Absolute Certainty in proving the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Faith to be Christ's Doctrin. And so he hopes to save his own Credit for producing <hi>none,</hi> let the Credit of Christian Faith, and the repute of its being an <hi>Absolutely Certain Truth</hi> go where it will for him. However, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the shame justly due to such a Position, he must cast in some good words to fool his Readers; and, so, he grants that they who use due <hi>Care and diligence may attain to a true Certainty and satisfaction of Mind</hi> as to the sence of Scripture. But he never attempts to <hi>show</hi> that possibly they <hi>may not</hi> do so,<note place="margin">P. 36.</note> but may hap to fall into damnable Heresies as the <hi>Socinians</hi> do; who, for ought he or I know, us'd as much <hi>Care and Diligence,</hi> as he and his Party use. Again, what means <hi>Satisfaction of Mind?</hi> Is Faith ever a jot more <hi>Certain</hi> or <hi>True</hi> because some may be <hi>Satisfy'd</hi> it is? Are not the <hi>Socinians</hi> as well <hi>satisfy'd in mind</hi> that <hi>Christ is not God,</hi> as the Dr. is that he <hi>is God</hi>? Moreover; if the Argument he brings to <hi>prove</hi> his Faith to be Christ's true Doctrin, does not <hi>conclude,</hi> 'tis a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand to one that Acute and Intelligent men will find the flaw in it: And what can those men do in that case, so they be true to their Reason, the only Light they can <hi>yet</hi> guide themselves by? Must they <hi>Assent</hi> that his Faith came from Christ, when they see that, notwithstanding
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44996:171"/>
all the Proof he brings for it, it may <hi>not be Christ's,</hi> and <hi>hazard</hi> to Embrace that Doctrin for <hi>his Faith</hi> which may, for any thing they know, have the <hi>Father of Lyes</hi> for its Author? They must <hi>Suspend</hi> then in that case, and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy themselves by alledging that the <hi>best</hi> Arguments, the most Learned Christians bring to <hi>prove</hi> it, <hi>conclude</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; Nay 'tis to be fear'd they will disgrace the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as a company of Fops, for believing upon weak Grounds; and, by showing them such, lay a just Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall upon the Christian <hi>Church</hi> for pretending to <hi>hold</hi> what Christ taught, when as yet <hi>none in it</hi> are able to <hi>prove</hi> it <hi>was</hi> his Doctrin. And how would they laugh Christians out of Countenance, if, proceeding on Dr <hi>St's short</hi> Grounds, they should only show them a Well-At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested Book <hi>containing</hi> those Doctrines, without ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining absolutely the true <hi>Sense</hi> of it, when as only that <hi>Sense</hi> was the Doctrine of Faith; and, which is worse, when they saw multitudes of numerous Sects at perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and irreconcileable variance about that <hi>Sense!</hi> The true <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> then must be such as sets Faith above any <hi>Peradventure</hi> of not being Christ's true Doctrin, and so, secure all who rely on it, how weak soever, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>deceiv'd</hi> or in an <hi>Error;</hi> and, withall, it must be such as Intelligent men, seeking for assurance of Christ's Faith, may be satisfy'd it is able to <hi>conclude</hi> it to be such, and the more Learned Faithfull <hi>Evince</hi> to Doubters and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> Opposers, that the Faith <hi>held now</hi> by themselves and the Church is the <hi>Self-same</hi> that Christ and his Apostles taught <hi>at First.</hi> But Dr <hi>St.</hi> dares not affirm any of this of <hi>his</hi> Rule of Faith; therefore his pretended Rule is <hi>none.</hi> His Instance of True Certainty attainable <hi>without Infallibility</hi> in that point of Faith, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <hi>That Iesus was the True Messias,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Fourth Cath. Letter. p. 25.26.</note> is partly answer'd in my <hi>Fourth Catholique Letter;</hi> and his alledging it has one strange inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in it, which I wonder he was not aware of, which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44996:172"/>
is, that <hi>the Proof of it depended on the Interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> He had it seems forgot that to manifest himself to be <hi>the true Messias, foretold by the Prophets,</hi> was the main Point of our Saviours Doctrin; and that he did <hi>Miracles</hi> to <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test that</hi> Doctrin, and make himself known to be that Person; which <hi>Miracles</hi> were <hi>Infallible</hi> Marks that that Doctrine of his in that point was <hi>True.</hi> And, when the Dr. produces <hi>Miracles</hi> to abet his Private Interpretations of Scripture, then he may have a fair pretence to lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the Publick Interpretation of the Church. Again, he is quite out as to the Subject of his discourse: For tho' it was <hi>a Point of Faith</hi> in the Jewish Law that a <hi>Messias</hi> was to come; yet that this very Person, <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> was to be that <hi>Messias,</hi> was <hi>no Point of Faith</hi> among them; and God's Providence, we see, took a far better way to make it out than <hi>Private Interpretations</hi> of the Scripture; unless he thinks <hi>Miracles,</hi> no more Effectual nor more Certain than private Interpretations are. What insignificant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things this Man brings for his choice Arguments, and what pains he takes in the worst cause in the world, <hi>viz. To maintain that Christian Faith needs not to be Absolutely Certain?</hi> And this, for no other reason (for 'tis every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian's Interest it should be so) but because his bad Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples can afford him no Argument to <hi>prove</hi> it to <hi>be such.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="41">41. His Pretence of my <hi>Second False Supposition,</hi> (viz. that a <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 37.</note> according to me <hi>must be a Mechanical Rule, and not a Rational</hi>) is weak beyond expression. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Schollar knows (his Friend Dr. <hi>T.</hi> particularly who took the same way and us'd the same expressions, <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> p. 4.) that Metaphors are translated from <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall</hi> to <hi>Intellectual</hi> things, in regard we have no <hi>Genuin Conceptions</hi> of these Later; (and indeed, most of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Christianity is made up of such expressions,) whence we can argue, by Analogy, from the one to the other. The word [<hi>Rule</hi>] is one of those Metaphoricall
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44996:172"/>
words: and, hence we say that, as a <hi>Material</hi> Rule is that by which if we draw our Pen, it directs us to make a Right <hi>Line;</hi> so, the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> being intended by God to direct us to <hi>Truth,</hi> will lead those <hi>Right</hi> who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it and regulate themselves by it. Does not this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor look a little more Proper, and the Discourse upon it hang better together than his likening Scripture to a <hi>Purse</hi>? yet he utterly dislikes it, and tells the Reader <hi>I falsly suppose the Rule of Faith must be a Mechanicall or Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters Rule with all its Dimensions fixt;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 37.</note> and denies that himself <hi>supposes</hi> it to be such a <hi>Materiall</hi> or Mechanicall <hi>Rule</hi>: Nor any man sure that were not stark Mad.<note place="margin">P. 38.</note> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, do we here meddle with its <hi>Dimensions</hi> or <hi>how much</hi> is of Faith, as he did when he spoke of <hi>his</hi> Rule? The <hi>Straightness</hi> of the draught, preserving us from the <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> of Errour, is the only point we aim at. Next, he denies there <hi>is any such Intellectuall Rule,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 38.</note> because <hi>there may be Mistakes in the Vnderstanding and Applying it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Care and Diligence and Impartiality are requir'd,</hi> else men <hi>may miss.</hi> How? <hi>Miss</hi> tho' they <hi>follow</hi> it? Then it self was not <hi>Straight;</hi> and, so, <hi>no Rule</hi>: For the very no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Rule is to be a Thing that has a <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> or direct us <hi>right,</hi> or <hi>keep</hi> the <hi>Understanding</hi> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it from <hi>missing;</hi> and to <hi>follow</hi> it is all the <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> it can need to do its Effect. Whence, all the <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> and <hi>Impartiality</hi> he speaks of, must be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in seeing they do indeed <hi>follow</hi> it: for none of these can help or hinder the Rule in its Power of direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; since it had <hi>this</hi> of it <hi>Self,</hi> independently of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi> But <hi>his</hi> Rule, tho' all these (as far as we Mortalls can discern) be us'd by the <hi>Socinians</hi> in the <hi>following</hi> it, still suffers those <hi>Carefull,</hi> and <hi>Diligent</hi> and <hi>Impartiall</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of it to err in Faith; Therefore 'tis <hi>no Rule of Faith.</hi> But 'tis mighty pretty to observe that when he is pincht with plain Sense he ever and anon runs to the

old Philosophers;<note place="margin">P. 37.</note> who he says, <hi>would have laugh'd at me for applying a Materiall Rule to Intellectuall things.</hi> Sure he's not well awake.

In a word, his Instance falters in the Third Proposition, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Two who have made use of the same way differ at least a hundred in casting up the Sum.</hi> Which is False; and by altering the Terms irregularly, he hinders any Conclusion from following. <hi>False,</hi> because, no two men can differ in a Sum, unless they wrong or <hi>abuse</hi> the Rules of Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Irregular;</hi> because, instead of the words [<hi>who take that Way</hi>] found in his Second Proposition and in our <hi>Discourse,</hi> he coggs in the words [<hi>make use of that way</hi>] which are not so <hi>express</hi> in sence as the word [<hi>Take</hi>] is, which imports <hi>following</hi> whither it leads, or making a <hi>right use</hi> of it.

those who both <hi>Take</hi> and <hi>Follow</hi> all along the Letter of Scripture interpreted by their private selves, and this <hi>to their power,</hi> and are skilfull in Languages &amp; in <hi>comparing</hi> places, do yet <hi>go wrong</hi>

His Discourse of <hi>Moral Qualifications</hi> requisit to the <hi>Certainty of Faith,</hi> as to know the Sense of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> if apply'd to our present Question, amounts to this; that no man can see the force of a <hi>Natural Medium leading to Faith,</hi> without <hi>Humility of Mind, Purity of Heart, Prayer to God, sincere Endeavours to do God's Will, &amp;c.</hi> So that for want of a good Argument, he has left off <hi>Disputing,</hi> and falls to <hi>Preaching,</hi> tho' he has had but ill Success in his <hi>Guildhall Sermon.</hi> 'Tis granted all these are excellent means to purge the Will from By-affections; and, by doing so, to leave the Understanding free to <hi>see</hi> the force of the <hi>Proof,</hi> and thence <hi>inferr</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> of what's <hi>prov'd</hi> or shewn to our Reason. But where's this <hi>Proof,</hi> where's this <hi>Truth</hi> all the while? Must we produce such <hi>invisible</hi> things for <hi>open</hi> Proofs? If all these Moral Qualifications be <hi>requisit</hi> (as he says) to make men <hi>Certain of</hi> Christ's <hi>Doctrin,</hi> he must prove that Himself and all his Sober Enquirers, which are the Members of his private-Spirited Church, have all these <hi>Qualifications,</hi> e're we or any man living can be certain they have true Faith. Again, how will he <hi>satisfy</hi> Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and <hi>convince</hi> acute Opposers and Adversaries what is the true Doctrin of <hi>Christ?</hi> Will the alledging <hi>Invisible Qualifications</hi> do the work? Moreover, he is Certain of his Faith by his Rule; and yet his Rule of <hi>Scripture</hi> ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44996:174"/>
none by his Doctrin but by vertue of these <hi>Moral Qualifications.</hi> These then are either his Rule or the <hi>best</hi> part of it. At least he maintains here they are <hi>requisit,</hi> and that otherwise Scripture is no Rule. He must then <hi>prove</hi> He has these Qualifications, or he cannot <hi>shew</hi> he has <hi>any Rule,</hi> or <hi>any Faith.</hi> In a word, we are disputing as Controvertists, and demand <hi>open</hi> &amp; <hi>intelligible</hi> Proofs; and he sends us to <hi>Invisible holes,</hi> which only God the searcher of Hearts can find out; and is not this <hi>mighty Learned</hi>? I wonder how he can pretend to Convert any man to <hi>Christ's</hi> true Doctrin by these Principles. All he can do is to alledge and compare Texts to <hi>prove</hi> it <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Christ's</hi> Doctrin; I but, Sir, says the other, how shall I be satisfy'd you have <hi>Humility of Mind, Purity of Heart, &amp;c.</hi> without which your self confess you cannot be certain of the true Sense of Scripture at all? What Art the Doctor has to satisfy him in this hard Point I know not. But setting the Doctor's Faith aside, what Provision has he made for the standing Visible Body of the Church to <hi>defend</hi> and <hi>maintain</hi> she has <hi>Christ's</hi> true Faith? None in the world by his Principles, unless she can <hi>prove</hi> she has all these <hi>Moral Qualifications.</hi> So that all is left to each private man's breast; and, if he has but this <hi>good Conceit</hi> of himself, that he is endow'd with all those excellent Virtues, and <hi>fancies</hi> that he prays better than all his Neighbours, let them be <hi>Socinians, Quakers</hi> or what you will, he is <hi>certain</hi> of his Faith meerly by vertue of this Self-conceit that he is such a <hi>Saint;</hi> since by Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s Principles without firm assurance that he is thus <hi>requisitly qualify'd,</hi> he can never have any assurance at all of his Faith. Might he not as well have told us in one word, that Himself and all his Friends are <hi>pure Saints,</hi> and <hi>know</hi> themselves to <hi>be so,</hi> and therefore they are Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they have these rare <hi>Qualifications,</hi> and by them As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of the <hi>Sense</hi> of Scripture, or <hi>Christ</hi>'s Doctrin; but

that all who do not think as they do, <hi>want</hi> those <hi>Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> are of the <hi>Wicked</hi> and Children of <hi>Darkness,</hi> and so can never have any Light to know whether they have <hi>Christ's</hi> true Doctrin or not? This then is the rare Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s Faith.

                     <note place="margin">P. 46.</note> and is very brisk that it overthrows my Demonstration. And what says his Instance?

as to think, that, when what he brings for an Answer is so evidently <hi>for me,</hi> it makes <hi>against</hi> me.

He must shew I say that <hi>Fallibility</hi> in the Testimony can ground <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> of the thing attested, and this, tho' a man <hi>sees</hi> that the Testimony and himself who relies on it may be in an <hi>Error,</hi> before he can make either the Letter or the Book of Scripture, <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> by Tradition or <hi>Human</hi> Testimony, which he maintains here is <hi>Fallible.</hi> Can a man think or say interiourly, [<hi>I am Absolutely (or perfectly) Certain of a thing peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> When that very [<hi>Peradventure</hi>] hinders his Certainty from being <hi>Absolute</hi> or <hi>Perfect?</hi> What answers he to this plain Evidence?

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44996:178"/>
highest which in point of Reason the thing is capable of, then there is that which I call Absolute Certainty.</hi> These words [<hi>Which I call</hi>] are very Emphatical, and precisely True; for no man living but himself and Dr. <hi>T.</hi> that I know of ever call'd it so. For, suppose the Evidence be but very <hi>slight,</hi> and the Thing, as propos'd to us, or in our Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, can give us no more, will this <hi>slight glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering Evidence</hi> make us <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> of it? Again, Does he mean <hi>in point of True Reason</hi> inform'd by the best Maxims to direct and establish it? This is <hi>Conclusive E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> or <hi>Demonstration,</hi> and the Conclusion thus deduc't is <hi>Infallibly</hi> True, because the Maxim which legitimates the Consequence, is, as all Logicians know, Infallibly Certain, being <hi>a Principle of our Understanding,</hi> and <hi>Self-evident</hi>; Is it this he means? No: He does not like <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive Evidence</hi> in the Grounds of his Faith by no means. To come closer, I ask him, Does he mean that <hi>True Knowledge,</hi> conformable to the Thing, or object, fixes him in that Certainty, or (in great part) his own aiery Apprehension? If such a <hi>Knowledge,</hi> then, since none can <hi>truly</hi> know what <hi>is not,</hi> that Knowledge is as Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be False, or is as <hi>Infallibly True,</hi> as 'tis that <hi>the thing must be what it is</hi>: And, if <hi>no such</hi> Knowledge grounds his Certainty, how is it an <hi>Absolute</hi> or <hi>Perfect</hi> one? Can his <hi>apprehending</hi> it so <hi>make</hi> it <hi>so</hi>? Can a man be Absolutely Certain of a <hi>Falshood,</hi> because he apprehends that Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood to be a Truth, or that a thing <hi>is so</hi> when 'tis <hi>not so</hi>? If not, then 'tis only it's <hi>being so</hi> which can be the Ground of <hi>Absolute Certainty,</hi> and <hi>justify that Assent,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> that Assent is <hi>Infallible,</hi> for a thing <hi>is</hi> Infallibly <hi>what it is.</hi> He'l say he <hi>took</hi> it to be so, and that's enough. But, to omit that his <hi>taking</hi> a thing to be so neither <hi>makes</hi> nor <hi>proves</hi> it to be so, I press farther: When he took it to be so, Did he <hi>take</hi> it <hi>right,</hi> or did he <hi>mistake</hi> it?

                     <hi>help</hi> is necessary to give his <hi>Rule</hi> (the rest being all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppos'd) the Power to <hi>regulate</hi> us in knowing the <hi>Sense</hi> of that Book or our <hi>Faith,</hi> as to those Spiritual and most Important Articles?

His Friend Dr. <hi>T.</hi> goes (by chance) a little more consonantly, and confesses the substance of this discourse of mine, by allowing that the Letter of Scripture must be <hi>Sufficiently Plain,</hi> even in those High Points I mention (<hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> p. 86.87.) But it seems, that upon second thoughts fearing to be pinch't hard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that point, they have since that time, chang'd their measures.</p>

For 'tis the greatest
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44996:182"/>
Injustice and Tyranny in the world to punish a man Temporally, or (which is worse) by Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures for following sincerely this <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> Besides, who can tell but this man is better stock't with Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s <hi>Morall Qualifications</hi> and Inward Light than his Judges and Pastours are?

                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> which such wicked Principles have tainted him with, and win him to a rational Humility by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting how all Mankind in their several affairs seek out one more skill'd than themselves and use their best rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in pitching upon him, and then trusting him in things themselves are Ignorant in. I would shew him how the Order of the World, the Commands of God, and his known Duty, do all oblige him to believe the Church in such matters rather than his own Private In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations; I would endeavour to shew him that the Preservation of these necessary Orders engages God's Providence to assist his Church and keep her from Erring in Faith, rather then private Men. I would show him that, since the only thing he doubts of is to know what <hi>Christ</hi> taught, &amp; that God has left some Way to make us sure of his true Doctrin, he must first find out such a Way that, if men follow'd it, would <hi>secure them</hi> from Errour in that particular. Nor would it be hard to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate to him that <note n="*" place="margin">see it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the Reflecter, p. 21.</note> Tradition is such a way, and that Scripture's Letter interpretable by private Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not that way. I would shew him how impossible
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44996:182"/>
'tis the Body of the Church should have unanimously <hi>deserted that Way</hi>; And, amongst other things I would inform him how <hi>weakly</hi> Dr <hi>St.</hi> had <hi>defended</hi> his <hi>Own</hi> Rule and <hi>impugn'd ours</hi>; and, lastly, how he and others who follow'd another way, have been forc't to grant that all the Main Points of Christian Doctrin may be false for any thing they know. These and such like Discourses, I hope, would at first <hi>startle</hi> him, and at length <hi>cure</hi> him, if he were not too deeply tainted with Enthusiasm, or a high opinion of his own <hi>Moral Qualifications</hi> and <hi>Divine Assistances</hi>: For, if he were, he is got beyond the reach of Reason and Humane Discourse; and is not to be helpt by any thing under a Miracle, perhaps not by that neither.</p>

then, 'tis ever understood with this restriction, that we must not make our suit to have Knowledge or Virtue by <hi>Extraordinary</hi> ways, and neglect the <hi>Ordinary</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods laid already by God's Providence to attain those good Gifts. Our Question then being of understanding those difficult places of Scripture which contain the main Articles of our Christian Belief, and whether they can better attain to the Sense of Scripture with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Certainty by their own Private Judgments, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Churches Help,</hi> or by <hi>the Churches Means,</hi> and Dr <hi>St's</hi> Principles asserting the former Method, mine the Later, I do affirm, that none of those Authors hold with him, but would condemn his Tenet for Heresy.

However, our Dr pretends himself wonderfully skillfull in our Authors, because he can make a shew of <hi>Quoting</hi> them, tho' it be quite from the purpose. He should have kept an Eye to the State of the Question, and brought his Citations <hi>home</hi> to <hi>it;</hi> but this is not his way. His main art through this whole Treatise is to keep <hi>that</hi> from the Readers sight, talk in Common, name great Authors for his Vouchers, but never shew <hi>how</hi> they savour him by <hi>applying</hi> them. And then he's safe, by virtue of a great noise &amp; fine <hi>Raree</hi> shows.<note place="margin">P. 62.</note> He ends with railing, at the rate of a man at his Wits End; I desire him to pacify his spleen, for no man that knows me and my circumstances, does or can think I write to <hi>raise</hi> my self, or to be <hi>caressed</hi> (as he phrases it) by any man.

'Tis so purely A-la-Mode of <hi>Merry Andrew</hi>; Never did Grave Man make such a Fop of himself. But his Reason was <hi>Nonplust,</hi> and his Fancy was over-heated, and this must plead his excuse: for what could he do better in such ill circumstances? To set right what his Raillery has so ravell'd; I declar'd my Tenet was, that every man is to use his <hi>Iudgment of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion</hi> or his <hi>Reason</hi> in finding out a <hi>Rule</hi> which could ascertain him of all the several Points taught by Christ: Since the Rule of Faith being <hi>antecedent</hi> to Faith, must consequently be the Object of <hi>pure Reason.</hi> That by this Rule he was to <hi>judge for his Salvation,</hi> and of <hi>all Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Points.</hi> For, if this Rule gave him Absolute Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that all those determinate Points were indeed taught by Christ, then since he acknowledg'd Christ's Doctrin to be <hi>from God,</hi> they were to be held by him to be <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>True;</hi> If it give him no such as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of this, being in it self <hi>Fallible,</hi> then they are not to be held <hi>Divine,</hi> nor <hi>True,</hi> nor <hi>Faith,</hi> nor the way to Salvation; since, in that case, they might perhaps be <hi>Diabolical, False, Heresy,</hi> and the <hi>way to Damnation.</hi> Now no such Rule does he assign us, but leaves it to the <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of his sober Enquirers to find out those determinate Points in Scripture's Letter; which, in those Articles of so profound a sense is <hi>obscure</hi> to them. <hi>Our</hi> Judgment of Discretion is to find out a <hi>Certain Light</hi> to walk by in those sublime passages, in which the Light of our own Reason is very dim. <hi>His</hi> is to do as well as he can in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating the Sense of the Scripture in such high passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, tho' he sees he may fall into Error every step. That is, his way is indeed to be a <hi>Rule to our selves,</hi> and scorn to be led by the <hi>Church,</hi> tho' there be all the Reason in the world to think Her wiser than our selves in that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44996:185"/>
What says the pleasant Dr to this? Or how does he make good <hi>his</hi> judgment of Discretion, or overthrow ours? why, First; he laughs heartily over and over, that I <hi>come closer</hi> to take a view of his Judgment of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion after 99. pages.<note place="margin">P. 62.</note> As if my whole Book had been to treat meerly concerning <hi>that one</hi> point, and I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver handled it till <hi>now</hi>: whereas his Conscience knows, (but that necessity has forc't him to bid it Farewell) and every Reader sees that above forty other Points were to be handled as they lay in my way, and that this concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Iudgment of Discretion,</hi> was the <hi>very last</hi> I was to speak to. What pityfull Trifling is this? Then comes in the <hi>Game at Cards, blew apron and Tub</hi> over and over: That I yield to his Sober Enquirer <hi>what he aim'd at</hi>; that I make the Fanaticks <hi>Catholiques,</hi> and his Sober Enquirer <hi>a Iudge of Controversies,</hi> and would have him judge <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Rule:</hi> Which is a continu'd <hi>Series</hi> of willfull and ridiculous Forgeries: For I allow him to judge of <hi>never</hi> a Point of Faith but <hi>by his Rule,</hi> and affirm that he is to find out his Rule by his <hi>Reason</hi> or Judgment of Discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But this clear Method he casts a Mist over all the way; and, finding that Seriousness would gravell him, he has recourse to his beloved and still-assisting Friend, Drollery. Next, he asks, what if the <hi>matter</hi> propos'd by this Certain Authority which I have found out by my Reason be very much <hi>against Reason</hi>? And I ask, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Matter</hi> under Consideration be the Object of Naturall Reason, or <hi>no?</hi> If it be <hi>not,</hi> then Reason is to concern it self in judging of the Humane <hi>Authority</hi> of the Church attesting it to be Christ's Doctrin, which is <hi>Subject to Reason</hi>; and not with the <hi>Other,</hi> which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly <hi>above Reason.</hi> He knows I still speak of the High Mysteries and Articles of our Christian Belief which are Supernaturally reveal'd or taught by Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; and will he have the profound Judgment of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44996:185"/>
of his Sober Enquirers scan them by their <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>? This savors too strong of the <hi>Socinian.</hi> Yet he sticks not to say <hi>the same,</hi> (that is, <hi>Natural) Reason helps</hi> men <hi>to Iudge of the Matters propos'd by this Certain Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> It makes yet worse for his Credit, that,<note place="margin">P. 64. l. 3 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> whereas I instance all along in the Tenets of the <hi>Blessed Trinity</hi> and the <hi>Godhead of Christ,</hi> he stills recurrs to <hi>Points necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Salvation</hi>; by counterposing which he seems to think those Mysteries <hi>not necessary to Salvation.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 64.</note> But <hi>who set the bounds of Reason</hi>? why, God and Nature, by alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Reason</hi> for its Sphere <hi>Naturall Objects</hi>; and by so doing, precluding her from attempting to sound the Profound <hi>Depth</hi> of <hi>Supernatural</hi> ones by her <hi>Shallow</hi> Line.

                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>I have no more use of you.</hi> This savours yet more strongly then the former. Would he have us, after this <hi>Certain</hi> Authority has <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd</hi> us 'tis <hi>Christ's Doctrin,</hi> still to <hi>suspend</hi> our Belief till we have examin'd the <hi>Mysteries</hi> themselves by our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Reason? I am loath to name what this signifies. I omit to insist on his bad Logick, shall I say, or want of Common Sense; who, tho' a Certain Authority were suppos'd, yet discourses all along as if the things it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses may still be false, or need the Examination of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whether they be false or no. But this argues he has not once in his thoughts the Notion of <hi>True Certainty,</hi> but means some <hi>Mock-Certainty</hi> or <hi>Probability</hi> by that word; otherwise 'twas impossible such a Fancy should have a seat in his Mind. For the most obvious and Common Light of Reason tells him that what's <hi>Truly Certain</hi> (as what's built on a Certain Authority is,) <hi>cannot</hi> be False, nor can need any further <hi>Scrutiny</hi> whether it be or no.</p>
                  <p n="54">54. Next he asks,<note place="margin">P. 65.</note> 
                     <hi>Are all People Capable of this Certain Reason</hi>? They are, or may be made so according to their pitch, so Tradition be rightly represented, and not Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

as it was by him throughout his Sermon: For nothing is more sutable to the Capacity of every one then is the Force of a vast <hi>Witnessing, Authority.</hi> And, tho' they were not, yet being in it self Certain, it preserves even those who are uncapable of seeing the reason for its Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, from erring in Faith while they rely on it, which his Rule does not. He puts Questions and gives Answers here very kindly for his own behoof; and from such sleight Grounds concludes <hi>he may have True Faith and be sav'd without finding out this Certain Authority.</hi> The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I leave to God's Mercy, which may, I hope, give him the Grace to repent his impugning known Truths, which with him I fear is too frequent: but he makes himself too Liberall a promise of <hi>True Faith</hi> without it. However he expresses it modestly, and only says he <hi>may have it</hi>; that is, he <hi>may hap</hi> to hold <hi>right</hi> in <hi>Some</hi> points of Faith by his private Interpretation of Scripture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Tradition of the Church; and he <hi>may hap</hi> to hold <hi>Twenty Heresies.</hi> His fifth Head is ridiculous; for 'tis a pure Folly to talk of <hi>believing the Scripture,</hi> without knowing certainly <hi>what</hi> the Scripture <hi>says.</hi> Let him se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this, and none will refuse to yield a perfect and sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast belief to what Christ has taught us by <hi>it.</hi> Our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Sense</hi> of it in passages containing dogmatical Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of Faith is the only Point between us; In assigning some Certain Means to do this, he is <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>flat,</hi> or else perfectly <hi>Silent</hi>; but mighty <hi>brisk</hi> in what's nothing to our purpose. His Sixth is frivolous, and answer'd with a bare denying that we hold that <hi>Tradition is only to lead us into the Certain Sense of Scripture.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 66.</note> And this he <hi>knew</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as he did five hundred things he pretends here <hi>unknown</hi> to him.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44996:186"/>
our Proofs over and over again; in the mean he reaps the advantage of <hi>gaining time,</hi> and coming off dextrously <hi>at present.</hi> His Seventh is the same with the Second, and spoken to already.<note place="margin">P. 67.</note> His citing Scripture Texts has the same fault with better half this whole Book; <hi>viz.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is said <hi>in common</hi> never <hi>apply'd</hi> to the point in hand, or brought <hi>close</hi> to it, but left in that <hi>Raw</hi> Condition, to make the Reader think there is <hi>Something</hi> in it, tho' he knows not well <hi>what.</hi> Our point is, that our Judgment of Discretion is not to be Employ'd about scanning the Mysteries of Faith by our <hi>Natural Reason,</hi> after we have found a Certain Authority proving them to be Christ's Doctrin, or interpreting such Texts of Scripture by our Private Judgments to gain Assurance what is to be held <hi>of Faith.</hi> The first Text [<hi>I speak as to Wise Men, judge ye what I say</hi>] may, for any thing he has shown relate to Manners, or to the avoiding Idolatry spoken of the verse before, which is known by the Light of Nature; or to something relating to or consequent from a Point of Faith already known, as is intimated in the following verses. Of all these they may judge, but <hi>None</hi> of these comes near our business, as appears by the State of the Question. The Second Text is <hi>Prove all Things.</hi> And does he think this can mean, they should consult their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reason how it lik't the Misteries, or rather (in case that Text had indeed related to them) does it not signify that they should consider well of the <hi>Grounds</hi> why they Embrac't them? The Third is, <hi>Try the Spirits whether they are of God.</hi> And this is spoken in order to the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Hereticks; whose Spirits they were to <hi>Try</hi> by examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether they deviated from the Doctrin preacht by the Apostles; or, by looking what Grounds or Motives they produc't to prove their new Doctrin to be Christ's. The Judgment of Discretion in this Last case we allow; and the two Former are both of them wide of our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44996:187"/>
unless the Second were meant of examining things by the Grounds for them. It were good to dive into the Drs thoughts, and get light what it is he would here be at. The Apostles (says he) allow'd them <hi>to make use of their Understandings,</hi> tho' themselves, the Proposers were <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.</hi> What mean these dry <hi>Common</hi> words? Does he mean they were to <hi>Vnderstand</hi> what it was the Apostles taught? This is the Duty of every Hearer, Catholick and Protestant, and the very <hi>End</hi> of all <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; and, so, it does not reach the <hi>peculiarity</hi> of his <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Discretion.</hi> Does he mean they were to examin whether the Apostles were Divinely-inspir'd or not? This was very laudable in them; for this is to use their Reason e're they allow their Authority, and is the very Judgment of Discretion we recommend; but he is here impugning <hi>our</hi> Judgment of Discretion, and so cannot mean <hi>thus.</hi> He is then contending for a Judgment of Discretion which shall scan the Verity of the Points of Faith themselves, or the <hi>Matters propos'd even</hi> by a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Authority, by his Naturall Reason. I am loath to fix a censure upon Common words; but I must tell him that if he means so, and that, tho' we receive the Tenets of a <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Christ's Godhead</hi> (for example) upon a <hi>Certain Authority,</hi> we are still to suspend our Assent, till our Great Judgment of Discretion shall consider well of the <hi>Matters propos'd,</hi> and reject them if such uncouth Articles seem disagreable to <hi>Natural Reason,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 65.</note> (his <hi>usefull Servant</hi> not yet discarded:) If this be his Tenet, as it seems to be, then I must tell him his Principles are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>Socinian.</hi> Whether he follows those Principles in his particular Tenets I am not to judge; but such <hi>Edg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Leaning</hi> towards those Principles do, I conceive, oblige him to satisfy the World he is not that way Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44996:187"/>
wherein it lies, and how far it extends?</hi> I answer the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority our Question proceeds on is the Humane Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church deriving down Christ's Faith: Nor do I know any Catholick who ever impugned that, but one <hi>unknown Nameless</hi> Author <hi>Lominus</hi>; whom here out of his constant love to sincerity he is pleas'd to call [<hi>Others.</hi>] But, in case any should differ about it, it being a thing <hi>Previous</hi> to Faith, and, therefore, subject to our <hi>Natural Reason,</hi> all I can say is, <hi>the better reason must carry it.</hi> He knows well how many most Eminent Catholick Writers have approv'd and follow'd in their Writings the same way of Controversy I take. But he is not now in such good circumstances as <hi>candidly</hi> to <hi>acknowledge</hi> any thing. He is put to his shifts; and counterfeit Ignorance does him as much service as any of the rest.

of the Church; that 'tis to be consulted in <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious</hi> Points (and all <hi>Controverted</hi> Points, of which we speak, have been call'd into <hi>Doubt</hi>) which makes its <hi>Help</hi> very <hi>Needfull</hi>; and, (which I chiefly insist on) that its Authority is <hi>Clearly</hi> and <hi>without any Ambiguity demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Scripture</hi>; whereas yet in his Second Book <hi>de Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinâ Christianâ,</hi> he acknowledges the Obscurity of Scripture in divers places, <hi>Obscurè quaedam dicta densissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam caliginem obducunt.

I ask, with the good leave of his Jest, Does he think <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles taught any <hi>unnecessary</hi> Points? If not; why did he use such cautious diminishing expressions, and instead of <hi>All their Doctrin,</hi> put, <hi>All matters necessary to our Salvation</hi>? 2. Christians are wrought up to the <hi>Love of Heaven,</hi> the Immediate Disposition to it, by <hi>Motives,</hi> and <hi>Some</hi> may need <hi>more</hi> than <hi>Others</hi>; nay the variety of Peoples Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Circumstances is so Infinite that scarce <hi>two</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons will precisely need the <hi>same.</hi> He is to acquaint us then <hi>how</hi> he <hi>knows,</hi> or how he can <hi>make out,</hi> that every man shall, by reading the Scripture, be sure to find his own <hi>Quota</hi> of Motives adjusted and <hi>serving</hi> for his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Exigencies? 3. Is he <hi>Sure</hi> they cannot <hi>err</hi> as to what's necessary to their Salvation? If, provided they do their best, they cannot, then <hi>every</hi> man is so far <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi>; which the Doctor has deny'd hitherto to <hi>all Mankind</hi> but to <hi>himself.</hi> If they <hi>can err</hi> in matters neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salvation, then doubtless many <hi>will err,</hi> and how can errour <hi>Save</hi> them? 4. Tho' all cannot err in all <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Points, yet can he shew us any thing securing them from Erring in all those Articles of Faith held by the Church, and renounc't by her Heretical Dissenters ever since <hi>Christ</hi>'s time? If he <hi>cannot,</hi> (and he declines shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us they <hi>can,</hi> nay he by his Doctrin confesses they <hi>may</hi>) then they may be <hi>Sav'd</hi> tho' holding all the Heresies that ever were; in which case I doubt he will scarce find them competent Assurance of their Salvation. Again, how knows he but the mixture of many of those gross Errours may not as much <hi>deprave</hi> their Souls as their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding <hi>plainer places</hi> will <hi>edify</hi> them; especially if the Church interposes, and Excommunicates them for

Is the holding the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that <hi>God</hi> dy'd to save and redeem Mankind, a Matter <hi>Necessary to Salvation</hi>? Or is it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hold it was only a <hi>Man</hi> to whom they owe that highest Obligation to <hi>Love</hi> him? Let him speak to this at least; For I am not to expect but his aiery <hi>wordish</hi> Divinity makes him look upon the Mystery of the most Blessed <hi>Trinity</hi> as on a kind of dry Speculation.

Or, will he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr to <hi>Divine Assistances</hi> to keep <hi>Particular</hi> Persons from <hi>Errour,</hi> and yet <hi>deny</hi> them to the <hi>Church</hi>? If so, how <hi>proves</hi> he <hi>This</hi> at least? I wish he would speak out fairly and candidly to these Points, and make something <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here</hi>: For I profess with all sincerity I cannot for my heart make any <hi>Idea</hi> or Sense of this Motly Church which his Principles would patch up. The several Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it hang more <hi>loosely</hi> together than if they were ty'd to one another with <hi>Points</hi>: Nay, they <hi>agree worse</hi> than Fire and Water, and all the several <hi>Contrarieties</hi> in in Nature: for they are distanced by direct <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>

Other, the <hi>Book of Scripture</hi> into which they put it by <hi>Writing</hi>; and that Faith was properly in the <hi>Former</hi> only, in regard <hi>Truth</hi> is no where <hi>Formally</hi> but in the Minds of Intellectuall Beings; whereas it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Words Written</hi> as in a <hi>Sign</hi>; that is, <hi>no more properly</hi> than Wine was in a Bush; and that therefore the former had incomparably <hi>Better</hi> Title to be the <hi>Purse</hi> (if no Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor else would serve his turn but such an odd one) at least it ought not to have been quite set aside.

                     <hi>it could not be a Rule of Faith for all Persons.</hi> Let him then apply this to the Dogmatical Points which are only in Question, and <hi>shew</hi> it thus <hi>Easy</hi> to all Persons in those Texts that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain those Articles, and his Work is <hi>at an End.</hi> But alas! that <hi>Work,</hi> tho' 'tis his <hi>only Task,</hi> is not yet <hi>begun;</hi> nor, for any thing appears, ever <hi>Will.</hi> For 'tis a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Undertaking to go about to confute daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. What new Stratagem must be invented then to avoid it? Why he must slip the true Point again and alter it to an Enquiry, <hi>Whether the Scriptures were left only to the Church to interpret it to the People in all Points, or whether it were intended for the General Good of the Church, so as to direct themselves in their Way to Heaven, and consequently, whether it may not be open'd and understood by all Persons in Matters that are necessary for their Salvation.</hi> What a rambling, what a clutter of Questions is here, when he knows, and it has been repeated near a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred a times over, that our only Question is, <hi>whether the Letter of Scripture be intelligible by all sorts coming to Faith in those Revealed Articles which are properly Christian with such a Certainty as is fit to build Faith upon.</hi> But this is one main part of his Confuting Talent, to throw in twenty Questions so none of them be the <hi>right</hi> one. However, tho' he'll not <hi>keep</hi> the Way, he'll triumph unless we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him <hi>out of the Way.</hi> To his Questions then I answer 1. That none but Madmen ever thought or said that the Church was to interpret it as obscure to the People <hi>in All Points.</hi> For, ordinary Moral passages, such as the Ten Commandments are plain enough of themselves. Why did he not Instance in the <hi>Trinity,</hi> the <hi>Godhead of Christ</hi> and such like, which and <hi>only which</hi> we say are <hi>Obscure?</hi> Because, that had been to speak to our purpose, and he thought it <hi>safer</hi> for him to suggest <hi>other</hi> matters which
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44996:195"/>
were not all to purpose. 2. They were intended for the <hi>General Good of the Church,</hi> to direct them in their <hi>Lives,</hi> and, so in their <hi>Way to Heaven;</hi> and to that end are freely read by all that can understand Latin, and might likely have continued permitted to all even of the most vulgar capacities, had not men of his Principles made them think themselves, when they had got a Bible in their hands, wiser than the whole Church. Whence they came to wrest them to their own Destruction, and, therefore, it being now <hi>not for the General</hi> Good of such proud Fools, the Church took care they should not be promiscuously allow'd to all, tho' indulg'd to many, even in the Vulgar Tongue, and explain'd and preach't to <hi>All</hi> by their Pastours. Lastly, None knows distinctly what he means by <hi>Matters necessary to Salvation;</hi> He <hi>should</hi> mean such as those sublime Points so often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but then he must make out such passages <hi>can be understood by all Persons</hi> looking after Faith with unerring Certainty to <hi>secure</hi> their Faith from being so many <hi>Falshoods</hi> or <hi>Heresies;</hi> But he was not able to do this, tho' he pretended the <hi>Rule for all</hi> persons must be <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>Easy.</hi> As far as I can guess by a man's words whose whole Discourse is made up of <hi>Reserves,</hi> he mistakes the <hi>Rule of Manners</hi> for the <hi>Rule of Faith;</hi> and thus meant 'tis indeed <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>Easy,</hi> but as 'tis such 'tis nothing to the Question in debate, which is of Christian <hi>Faith,</hi> &amp; so 'tis nothing to <hi>our purpose.</hi> I, but <hi>Bellarmin</hi> says, Scripture is a Rule, and that a Certain and Infallible one. But when it comes to the proof he speaks only of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">P. 78.</note> and this as to the <hi>Law, Testimonies,</hi> or <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> which are easily intelligible as being either Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Ordinances, or Moral Precepts. I, but <hi>Christ proves his Doctrin by the Scripture, and confutes the Sadduces from them.</hi> Well, give us such an Interpreter of Scripture as Christ was, and we shall not doubt but they will <hi>prove
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44996:195"/>
his Doctrin,</hi> and <hi>confute all the Hereticks</hi> in the World. His <hi>referring the Pharisees to Scripture</hi> was <hi>ad hominem;</hi> for they allow'd the <hi>Scriptures</hi> yet would not believe his <hi>Miracles;</hi> Tho' sure Dr <hi>St.</hi> will not say but <hi>Christs Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> were in their own Nature more convincing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments than Interpretations of Scripture made or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by the Pharisees.

I <note n="*" place="margin">Third Cath.

themselves by it.</hi> Now the word <hi>Regulate</hi> has clearly an <hi>Active</hi> Signification; whence, it being impossible an <hi>Action</hi> should be without an <hi>Effect,</hi> it follows that <hi>Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency</hi> or <hi>Effectuallness</hi> is involv'd in it's Notion: So that, to do a thing <hi>Effectually</hi> does not signify any better degree of doing a Thing, but only to do it <hi>really</hi> and <hi>indeed.</hi> He pretends [<hi>Regulating</hi>] is <hi>an Ambiguous word,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he assigns it a double Signification. One of them is, <hi>what a Man doth in Conformity to his Rule</hi>: And Common sense tells us that as far as a man acts <hi>Unconformably to his Rule,</hi> he is <hi>not Regulated</hi> by that Rule, whence, to act <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to a Rule</hi> is the self same as to be <hi>Regulated</hi> by the Rule to which he is to conform. This then is <hi>one</hi> Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Regulating;</hi> and 'tis a <hi>right</hi> one; for to <hi>regulate</hi> one's self by a Rule is nothing else but to <hi>Act conformably to it.</hi> Lets see the other sense of the word <hi>Regulating.</hi> 'Tis this.

The Rule of Justice is to pay every man his own: Now comes an unconscionable Debtor, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains he has <hi>followed</hi> that Rule or <hi>Regulated</hi> himself by it in some Sense; because he has <hi>profess'd, declar'd</hi> and <hi>own'd</hi> he has follow'd that Rule, tho' he has not <hi>Effectually</hi> and <hi>Indeed</hi> done so.

                     <hi>and yet through their own Fault may deviate from them or Sin.</hi> But can Sinners with any sense be said to <hi>regulate</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by Christ's Commands, when they <hi>Sin</hi> meerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they <hi>profess</hi> to follow <hi>his Rule of Life?</hi> Or can any man of a settled Brain (Dr <hi>St.</hi> still excepted) pretend a Sinner can be said to be <hi>regulated</hi> by that Holy Rule, and <hi>deviate</hi> from it, or <hi>Desert</hi> it at the same time?

Can it be imagin'd but that many of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and the Pastours especially, put their doubts, and askt them Questions, concerning the Points of Faith they had Preacht, and receiv'd pertinent Answers; none of which a Book could do. How ridiculous a pretence then is this! Yet this is his best shift: For, unless the Book have This or an Equivalent Virtue to make <hi>Clear</hi> its Sense, it cannot have the Plainness or Clearness requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit to a <hi>Rule of Faith.</hi> He contends that, if those Points be <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> they must be so <hi>Plain that we may be Certain of our Duty to believe them.</hi> Which retorts his Discourse upon himself; for if those two sublime Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles there spoken of be <hi>Necessary</hi> for the Salvation of the Generality (which cannot be deny'd without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusing the Primitive Church of <hi>Tyranny</hi> for casting those out of the Church who deny'd them) then they must <hi>be Certain,</hi> one way or other, that 'tis their Duty to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:44996:198"/>
them; and, since he does not think fit to say this Duty can be <hi>Certainly</hi> shewn them by the Letter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it follows that this <hi>Duty to believe them,</hi> must be made <hi>Certain</hi> by the Testimony of the Church <hi>delivering</hi> them. 'Tis easy to be seen the whole force of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course here is built on his <hi>begging the Question,</hi> that Scriptures Letter as understood by Private Judgments, is the Rule of Faith; and that it is <hi>plain</hi> in all Necessary Points: Which he ought not to do without shewing us first <hi>which</hi> Points are Necessary, at least those of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and Godhead of <hi>Christ,</hi> if he think them so, and then proving his Rule is <hi>Plain</hi> in all such Points; and not still to <hi>suppose, presume</hi> upon, and <hi>occurr to</hi> that which is yet <hi>under Dispute, Vngranted,</hi> and <hi>Unprov'd.</hi> Let me then mind him of one piece of Logick, which tho' it be not <hi>Admirable,</hi> yet 'tis Solid and never regarded by him. 'Tis this, that no Argument has any force upon another, but either by its being so <hi>Evident</hi> that he must forfeit his Reason to deny it, or <hi>Granted</hi> by his Adversary; so that he must either Argue from something <hi>Clear of it self</hi> or <hi>made Clear</hi> by <hi>Proof,</hi> or else argue <hi>Ex concessis</hi> from the Party's own Concession. By which Rule if all the Reasons he brings here were examin'd, it will manifestly appear he has not spoken one word of True Reason a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me in his whole Answer. I do here Challenge him to shew me so much as <hi>any One</hi> Argument of his that has either of these Qualifications: and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him to such a performance, if he can shew me any <hi>One</hi> such, I promise him to pass all the rest for valid and good. I end with desiring the considering Reader to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect on the Drs Discourse here p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 82. and upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act review of it to determine whether Principles are not deeply laid here to make the <hi>Socinians</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther known Hereticks, Members of his Church, and to free them from Church Censurers. For if they find
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44996:199"/>
not in Scripture that the Apostles Preacht the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Godhead of Christ</hi> in clear and Express terms, and with this Connotate, [<hi>as necessary to Salvation</hi>] they cannot be <hi>Certain of their Duty to believe them,</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of which I need not dilate on. His own Church is more concern'd to look to his Tenets than I am.</p>

He triumphs much that I grant <hi>Some may be sav'd without the Knowledge of all Christ Taught</hi>; He means, those Spiritual Points so often mention'd. But, if he knew how little advantage he gains by it, he would not think it worth his taking notice of. What may be done in an abstracted case is <hi>one</hi> thing; what, if they live in a <hi>Church,</hi> and hold Heresies contrary to Christ's and the Church's Doctrin, is <hi>Another.</hi> Some Catholick Divines treating of Faith do mantain that to hold <hi>There is a God,</hi> and that <hi>He is a Rewarder and Punisher,</hi> is <hi>Simply enough</hi> for <hi>Salvation</hi> if they live up to those Tenets; whence they conceive hopes that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was sav'd tho' he was no <hi>Iew.</hi> But what's this to our case? Christ has left us a Body of Doctrin; and since he did nothing <hi>Unnecessary</hi> for the Salvation of <hi>Mankind,</hi> this being the End of his <hi>Coming</hi> and <hi>Preaching,</hi> each Point conduced to that End either immediately or by Consequence, whence by the way 'tis a Folly to expect the Apostles Taught such Points <hi>as necessary to Salvation,</hi> others as <hi>not necessary,</hi> since no Point was <hi>Vnnecessary</hi> for the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Mankind</hi>; except when they said for Distinction, <hi>Dico ego, non Christus,</hi> or us'd some Equivalent expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But to return, God has also settled a <hi>Church</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that Doctrin of Christ <hi>Intire.</hi> Whence, if any falls into Heresies contrary to that Doctrin by Misunderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Scripture's Letter in such passages, 'tis her Duty to cast them out of the Church and deliver them over to <hi>Satan,</hi> for their contumacious Pride in preferring their own Private Judgments before the Judgment of their
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44996:199"/>
Pastours, and the Church whom <hi>God appointed to Teach Them.</hi> Whence, I do assure him I do not hold that <hi>any one</hi> such <hi>Privative Unbeliever</hi> will ever be sav'd, tho' he holds some Points which, <hi>of their own Nature</hi> might suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for <hi>Salvation.</hi> For, such a man believes nothing at all but upon his own <hi>Self conceit,</hi> and the very <hi>Ground</hi> of his <hi>Faith,</hi> let him prate of Scripture as much as he will, is <hi>Spiritual Pride</hi>; which Vice alone is enough to <hi>damn</hi> him, even tho' he held all those Points of Christ's Faith to a Tittle. Hence follows that either the Primitive Church (as hinted above) was very uncharitable in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating those who dissented from those High Articles; Or else, the Rule of Faith must be so <hi>Plain</hi> and <hi>Clear</hi> that it must preserve those from Heresy who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, and render them <hi>Inexcusable</hi> who by <hi>deserting</hi> it do fall into the opposit <hi>Heresies</hi>: And, therefore, that we may bring our Discourse back to the Question, he must either prove his Rule of Faith thus Qualify'd, or <hi>'Tis no Rule.</hi> What follows to p. 85. is meer Drollery; which gives all the seeming <hi>Strength</hi> to his <hi>Weak</hi> reasoning. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he has a fling at <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> which is a Topick of course in his Controversy. He thinks 'tis <hi>Unnecessary</hi> to the Church; but the Church it seems thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to define it, in her Circumstances; and I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive the necessary occasion of <hi>defining</hi> it was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such as He Equivocated in the Tenet of the <hi>Reall Presence;</hi> and (according to the Drs late Distinction making <hi>Not-Regulating</hi> to be one sort of <hi>Regulating</hi>) would needs have the word [<hi>Reall</hi>] to mean [<hi>Not-Reall</hi>] whence it was judg'd expedient to put it past quibble by such a rigorously-express Definition. And I much fear this vexes the Drs Sacramentarian Spirit far more then <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation</hi> it self. I omit, that he has forgot here the Common distinction of what Points are necessary <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate Medij,</hi> and what <hi>Necessitate Praecepti.</hi> I suppose
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44996:200"/>
because this Later did not sute with his <hi>Levelling</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which set the <hi>Church</hi> and his <hi>Rabble</hi> on <hi>even</hi> Ground as to Matters of Faith.</p>

I alledg'd that those Articles of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Christ's Godhead</hi> were <hi>Fundamentall Points;</hi> and therefore if his Rule could not <hi>Absolutely Ascertain</hi> People of all sorts coming to Faith of those Articles, it could assure them of <hi>None,</hi> and so is <hi>no Rule of Faith.</hi> He runs quite away from the Points, and thinks he has done enough to say, <hi>It is Absolutely Certain that God has reveal'd the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentalls of our Faith.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 85.</note> But the Question sticks still, Are you <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> by your Rule that the <hi>Trinity and Christ's Godhead</hi> are Christ's Doctrin or signify'd with <hi>Absolute Certainty</hi> by Scripture's Letter? To this he says nothing, but shifts it off most Shamelessly to another thing. Let him set himself to do this which is <hi>his</hi> Task, and we will undertake to examin the Nature of his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> and show it <hi>Inconclusive.</hi> I alledg'd that there is <hi>Experience,</hi> by the <hi>Socinians</hi> taking the same way, that his <hi>Medium</hi> or way to be Certain of this is not <hi>Certain.</hi> He again turns off <hi>Experience</hi> that the way he takes is not <hi>Certain,</hi> to <hi>Experience</hi> of his Inward <hi>Certainty,</hi> or his Inward <hi>Persuasion.</hi> And asks briskly, <hi>whether he or I know best?</hi> A pleasant Gentleman! Why does he not confute all my Book by that Method? Does he think 'tis enough to show he is <hi>Absolutely Certain</hi> of the <hi>Sense</hi> of Scripture as to those Points, with barely saying, <hi>he knows he is</hi> thus <hi>Certain</hi> of it better than I? What wretched Shifts are these? In pursuance of this new Method of <hi>Proving</hi> and <hi>Confuting</hi> He asks again, <hi>How comes Mr. S. to know we are not Certain when we say we are</hi>?<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Because, when you are most highly <hi>Concern'd,</hi> and stood <hi>Engag'd</hi> by promise to show this Absolute Certainty, and are <hi>Prest</hi> to it Vehemently, and upon the brink of losing your <hi>Credit</hi> for not doing it, you still decline the showing you have any <hi>such</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44996:200"/>
for the <hi>Sense</hi> of Scripture as to those Points. Still he asks, <hi>Are not we Certain because some</hi> (that is, the <hi>Socinians</hi>) are not <hi>Certain</hi>? No, Sir, not barely for that reason; but because the <hi>Socinians</hi> proceeding upon the <hi>Same Rule,</hi> are so far from being Certain of the Sense of Scripture as to those Points, that they esteem themselves Certain by the same Scripture of Hereticall Tenets Point-blank <hi>Opposit</hi> to those Points. Common Reason assures us no <hi>End</hi> can be compass'd without a <hi>Means,</hi> and therefore you can never show us <hi>You</hi> are Certain, till you show us you <hi>follow</hi> a better <hi>Way,</hi> rely on a firmer <hi>Ground,</hi> and <hi>Guide</hi> your selves by a <hi>Clearer Light</hi> to make you Certain of Scriptures Sense in those passages, than <hi>They</hi> do: which you <hi>can never show,</hi> and, as appears by your wriggling from that Point by the most untoward Shifts imaginable, <hi>dare not Attempt.</hi> But some are uncertain of <hi>Orall Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> nay <hi>Censure</hi> it: I do not know one man but holds and reverences it.

It had been happy for them, had Dr. <hi>St.</hi> presided in those Councils, for he would doubtless have dealt with them very <hi>kindly,</hi> and have clapt them head and tail together with good Catholicks, into one Latitudinarian Bill of Comprehension. 5.

To show the Inconsistency of his Tenets, and utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his Pretence of that Rule, I <note n="*" place="margin">First Cath.

To press my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment still more home, I urg'd that perhaps, according to him, they had <hi>no Faith at all</hi> during that <hi>long Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi>; because wanting <hi>other</hi> Books or sufficient warrant

To show more the Inconsonan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his Doctrine, I noted that, notwithstanding all this, <note n="*" place="margin">Second Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Mr G. p. 31.</note> he declar'd that he lookt upon the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> tho' so ill furnish't with his Rule, as on <hi>the Best Arbitrator between us in all our Controversies about the Sense of the doubtfull</hi> (that is Controverted) <hi>places of Scripture.</hi> Now, one would verily think this pressing Discourse, following the Point in Question so <hi>Close</hi> and pursuing it so <hi>Home,</hi> were exceedingly worth his while to Answer, if he could; since it toucht his <hi>Rule</hi> and his <hi>Cause</hi> to the quick. Now lets see what he says in their Defence. The Substance of his Answer (for all the rest is impertinent) is a most doughty and most weighty word <hi>[If] If God</hi> (says he) <hi>hath so Abundantly provided for his Church that there may be a full Revelation of all Points of Faith in the rest,</hi>

Did not I, not only speak of but most <hi>Expressly</hi> discourse <hi>all along</hi> of those <hi>many</hi> or <hi>most</hi> Books of Scripture, not Universally <hi>known</hi> and <hi>accepted</hi> at the very first, but by <hi>degrees spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and gaining in <hi>Process of Time</hi> the Credit of being <hi>Authentick</hi>?

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44996:204"/>
out a word or two which may best serve him to slip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Point; and turn it to quite another busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but leaves the whole Stress and full import of the Argument <hi>Unanswer'd.</hi> It were tedious still to reflect how oft he has done thus in this pretended Reply to my <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique Letters</hi>: But, whoever <hi>compares</hi> his severall An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers to the respective places he pretends to speak to, will see how dull and insignificant they are; tho' if he be read <hi>alone,</hi> especially with an Implicit Belief of his dealing fairly, they look very jolly and brisk. However to divert the Readers Eye he is even with me in another Point. I said the <hi>accepting or not accepting Books</hi> whether in the <hi>Latin</hi> or <hi>Greek Churches</hi> was an <hi>Act of Prudence An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to the Iudgment or Determination of any Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Third Cath.

To clear which 'tis to be observed that our Divines admit <hi>Prudentiall Considerations</hi> in any <hi>Church,</hi> even tho' held Infallible, <hi>Previous</hi> to her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, &amp; yet do not hold that Church is Infallible in those Acts of Prudence which are thus <hi>Antecedent.</hi> Now, tho' the whole <hi>Series</hi> of my Discourse there shows clearly that I spoke of an <hi>Antecedency</hi> in the Course of <hi>Humane Actions,</hi> or of a <hi>Prudentiall Deliberation Antecedent</hi> to an <hi>Absolute Decision</hi>; he turns it to an <hi>Antecedency</hi> in <hi>Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> or of more <hi>Antient Writers</hi>;<note place="margin">P. 96.</note> and when he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd that word to a wrong matter he has the Vanity to insult. But, he says, I say not a Syllable to his proving hence the <hi>Roman Church was not then believ'd Infallible.</hi> Surely he never <hi>consider'd</hi> what he pretends to <hi>Answer</hi>; for by saying it was not only an <hi>Act of Prudence Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to any Degree,</hi> I show there was no occasion to show what was then believ'd of her Infallibility or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd. Again, since the Certainty of that Epistles being
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44996:205"/>
writ by St. <hi>Paul</hi> depended on Testimony, other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es might perhaps know that better for some time than She. But, the worst is, he was preparing for <hi>New</hi> Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, to avoid the danger in keeping to the <hi>True one.</hi> For he knew the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Church we are here defending, is that of <hi>Tradition</hi> in delivering down <hi>the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of Christ;</hi> and he does not, sure, judge it a Point of Christ's Doctrin that the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> was writ by S. <hi>Paul.</hi> Add, that when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did <hi>Decree</hi> any thing at all in that matter, it was for the <hi>Reception</hi> of that Epistle; in doing which he will not, I hope, say she <hi>Err'd.</hi> So that our great Dr is <hi>out</hi> in every particular in which he shows such Confidence, or rather he is to talk very <hi>Confidently</hi> whenever he is <hi>out,</hi> that he may not seem <hi>not to be out.</hi>

Now, if I us'd such words as [<hi>who rejected the Canon of the New Testament</hi>] I spoke <hi>Nonsense;</hi> for those Hereticks were dead long before that <hi>Canon</hi> was settled: But if I did not, then he has abus'd me and our Readers too, and done no great right to himself. Let Eye-sight decide it. In my Third Catholick Letter. <hi>p.</hi> 59. (the place he cites) line 11.12. my express words are, <hi>The Consent of all your Christian Churches for Scripture;</hi> and he instead of [<hi>Scripture</hi>] puts down as my words [<hi>The Canon of the New Testament.</hi>] I can compassionate <hi>Humane Oversight</hi> (for it may hap <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly</hi> tho' it can never <hi>knowingly</hi> to be my own Case) and not too severely impute a mistake in altering my <hi>Words,</hi> and by them my <hi>Sense</hi>: Yet I must needs say that to put
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44996:205"/>
those wrong words in the Italick Letter to breed a more perfect Conceit they were <hi>mine,</hi> and quote the very page in the Margent where no such words were found, to make me speak Nonsense, looks a little Scurvily; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, because when men have their Eyes upon the <hi>very Page,</hi> as he had, they have an easy and obvious directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>words</hi> too. But, why do I make such a <hi>Spitefull Reflexion</hi> on him as to call them <hi>His Christian Churches</hi>? Because he would needs allow other Sects, as perfectly Hereticall as they were to be [<note n="*" place="margin">Dr St's Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Letter to Mr G. p. 24.25.</note> 
                     <hi>Christian Churches</hi>] tho' he was put upon it to give them a distinct Character; and here again he grants them to be <hi>parts of the Christian Church,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 98.</note> tho' they be <hi>cut off</hi> by Lawfull Authority from the body of Christianity. Next, that I may speak my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, because I fear, by many passages in his Books, by his ill-laid Principles, and the very <hi>grain</hi> of his Doctrin and discourses, he judges all to be good <hi>Christians</hi> who profess to ground their Faith on <hi>Scripture,</hi> let them hold as many Heresies as they will. And, lastly, for his fierce anger here against me for calling those Hereticks, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Arians, Nestorians,</hi> &amp;c. which have been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by Generall Councils, (for I concern not my self with his <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Abyssins</hi> or any others) <hi>Excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious Outcasts,</hi>

this? If the <hi>Chapter</hi> or <hi>Verse</hi> he cites be not <hi>True Scripture,</hi> or if any materiall <hi>Word</hi> in the Verse be <hi>alter'd</hi> can he securely build his <hi>Faith</hi> on it?

Neither of them is his Concern: What does he then? Why he complains how <hi>hardly we are satisfy'd about the Certainty of Scripture</hi> and that we are <hi>Incurable Scepticks.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 99.</note> Sure he dreams. <hi>We</hi> are <hi>Satisfy'd</hi> well enough; but his Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that we are not satisfy'd of it <hi>by his Principles;</hi> and how should we; if, when it was his <hi>Cue</hi> to satisfy us, he will never be brought to go seriously about it? And why must we be <hi>Scepticks;</hi> when as we both <hi>hold</hi> the Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the Letter our selves in Texts relating to Faith, and <hi>Assign</hi> a way to secure it <hi>Absolutely,</hi> which he <hi>cannot</hi>? Must all Men necessarily be <hi>Scepticks</hi> who allow not his <hi>No-way</hi> of doing this, tho' they <hi>propose</hi> and <hi>Maintain</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way that <hi>can do it?</hi> This is a strange way of <hi>Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> He says <hi>There are different Copies in all Parts to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min and Compare.</hi> 'Tis these very Copies that are <hi>in Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi> whether they give Absolute Certainty of every <hi>Verse</hi> or materiall <hi>Word</hi> in the Letter of Scripture, and we expected he should have shown <hi>how</hi> they did so, and not barely <hi>name</hi> them, and say there are such things. But the main Point is, Must those who are looking for Faith run to all <hi>parts</hi> of the World, and <hi>examin</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare</hi> all the Copies e're they embrace any Faith? This looks like a Jest: Yet 'tis a sad, tho' a mad Truth by his Principles. For without knowing <hi>this,</hi> Scripture cannot be their Rule; and hee'll allow no way to come to Faith but by Scripture; So that, for any Assurance he can give them, (even of his <hi>Necessary</hi> Points) they must e'n be content to stay at home, and live and dye without any Faith at all. He ends. <hi>And Thus I have answer'd all
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44996:206"/>
the Objections I have Met with in</hi> J.

But, first he will clear his bad <hi>Logick</hi> for letting the Argument stand yet in its full force, and falling very manfully to Combat the Conclusion: and tho' Common Sense tells every man this is not to <hi>Answer</hi> but to <hi>Argue,</hi> yet he will have <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing</hi> to be <hi>Answering</hi> for all that. 'Tis his Interest to do it solidly, for he has all the World, who in their Disputes follow the contrary Method, to confute. His main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to prove that <hi>Arguing</hi> is a good way to <hi>Answer</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Argument attempts to prove a thing <hi>Impossible,</hi> and that 'tis <hi>contrary to Sense and Experience</hi> to say the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Churches do not differ in what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive upon Tradition;<note place="margin">P. 101.</note> and so the same Answer that <hi>Diogenes</hi> gave to <hi>Zeno's Argument against Motion</hi> by <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi> will serve the turn. Let's examin this parallel, in which consists the substance of his Defence of his bad Logick. Does all the World <hi>see</hi> that the Generality of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44996:207"/>
the <hi>Greek</hi> Church proceed upon Tradition in what they differ from the <hi>Latin</hi> as certainly and evidently as they see there is <hi>Motion?</hi> Have not I produc't in my <hi>First Catholick Letter,</hi> p. 35. reasons enow to shew him how disputable this point is, none of which he so much as mentions? Did not I there p. 13. quote him out of his own book <hi>Peter Lombard,</hi> saying, that the <hi>Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Greeks and Latins is in Words and not in Sense</hi>? Nay, <hi>Thomas a Iesu, Azorius, &amp;c.</hi> who were of the same Judgment? And could not these Learned men see a thing manifest to <hi>Sense and Experience</hi>? Our point then is nothing like that of denying Motion, nor is it <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Sense and Experience,</hi> but such as bears a Dispute amongst intelligent Men and Great Schollars, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, even by the Drs own Discourse, an <hi>Argument</hi> or <hi>Instance,</hi> brought against the <hi>Conclusion</hi> was no <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Premises</hi> of the Argument brought by Mr. <hi>G.</hi> and so all the Division he runs upon it here is perfectly frivolous. Nor was Mr <hi>G.</hi> oblig'd either to <hi>grant</hi> or <hi>deny</hi> the Greek Church had <hi>Err'd,</hi> but was to insist on an Answer to his Argument; because the Dr had playd foul play, in attacking his <hi>Conclusion</hi> when he was to <hi>answer</hi> his <hi>Proof;</hi> which if admitted, no Discourse could possibly proceed. For, let us suppose Dr. <hi>St.</hi> had been to <hi>argue,</hi> and had brought this <hi>Instance</hi> of the Greek Church; would he have thought it fair that Mr <hi>G.</hi> when he was to <hi>answer</hi> it, should have brought the Argument he made use of in the Conference, and have bid him prove that two Churches following Tradition differ'd in Faith, <hi>notwithstanding his</hi> Demonstration that they could not? Or, would it be held a competent Answer to his late Book against the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> to bid him prove it had not follow'd Tradition, <hi>notwithstanding</hi> all that a multitude of Learned Catholick Authors had writ to the contrary? I <hi>took heart</hi> then indeed, as he says, seeing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44996:207"/>
the Dr so <hi>Nonplust,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 102.</note> but 'tis his own fiction that I <hi>resolv'd to grapple with his Instance,</hi> it being impertinent to do it in those circumstances, and so he may thank himself if he were <hi>disappointed.</hi> I was ty'd to the known Laws of Dispute, and not bound to dance after his Pipe when he strays from all the Clearest Methods of <hi>Reasoning.</hi> I objected that himself had defended the <hi>Greek</hi> Church from <hi>Erring</hi> in his <hi>Rational Account;</hi> which spoils his own Instance of a Church <hi>going upon Tradition</hi> and <hi>Erring.</hi> He calls this <hi>Trifling,</hi> and says <hi>the Dispute was about Mr</hi> G<hi>'s Argument.</hi> Yes; but these words were not brought to abet his Agreement, but expressly to shew the Drs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consonancy to himself, and his Unconscienciousness in arguing from the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches <hi>Erring;</hi> whereas it was his <hi>Opinion</hi> it did <hi>not Err.</hi> And tho' Mr <hi>G's</hi> Answer may be pretended not to be so pat to the particular Demand, yet it was apposit to the main Point that no Church did at once <hi>adhere</hi> to Tradition and <hi>Err</hi> at the same time. For which I gave my reason,<note place="margin">P. 103.</note> because if each Successive Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration follow'd their Fathers Tradition from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the <hi>last</hi> Son must believe as the <hi>first</hi> did. This was too hot to handle,<note place="margin">P. 104.</note> and so 'tis answer'd with <hi>Good Night to the Greek Church;</hi> which is Learned beyond expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Lastly, upon my saying, <hi>He might as well have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc't in the Latin Church it self, without running so far as Greece;</hi> he takes hence an occasion to accept of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge,</hi> tho' it did not look like one, being only spoke oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally; and threatens us not with a bare instance but a whole Book against us: He may use his pleasure; tho' I must tell him it looks but <hi>cowardly</hi> to threaten when he's <hi>running away</hi> from his business, undertaken and not yet perform'd; and leaving the <hi>Absolute Certainty of his</hi> poor destitute <hi>Faith</hi> in the suds.

But, he had a mind to be at another Work more suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Quoting <hi>Genius,</hi> and hop'd to draw us after him from a Conclusive and short way of Discoursing to an Endless one, of answering every frivolous mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood or misapply'd Citation.</p>

But now he will shew us how 'tis <hi>Possible to adhere to Tradition &amp; yet err.</hi> A hard Task, if apply'd to our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness! For, since <hi>to adhere to Tradition</hi> is still <hi>to believe what was deliver'd,</hi> to shew that those who <hi>adhere</hi> to Tradition do <hi>err,</hi> is to shew that they who still believ'd the same <hi>Christ</hi> taught did <hi>not</hi> believe the same <hi>Christ</hi> taught.

One of adhering to it as the Rule and Means of conveying matters of Faith.</hi> The other for <hi>adhering to the very Doctrin taught</hi> at first and <hi>truely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd down since by Tradition.</hi> That is, there are two sorts of <hi>Tradition</hi> or <hi>Delivery;</hi> One is <hi>Tradition,</hi> the Other is not <hi>Tradition</hi> or <hi>Delivery,</hi> but the <hi>Points deliver'd.</hi> Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to this is his Distinction of <hi>Traditionary Christians.</hi> To what purpose is it, to talk <hi>Sense</hi> to a man who is resolv'd to run still so wildly into <hi>Nonsense?</hi> Do but see, good Reader, with what care I had forestall'd this very Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd Distinction in my <hi>Third Catholick Letter,</hi> p. 4.5.9.12. and shew'd how he had deform'd <hi>Tradition</hi> into all the untoward <hi>Senses</hi> man's wit could invent, by making it now signify <hi>Articles,</hi> now <hi>Power,</hi> now <hi>Points deliver'd;</hi> yet to convince the World that he <hi>cannot</hi> or rather <hi>must not</hi> speak Sense, he's at the same work again as briskly as ever: And good reason: <hi>Contradictions</hi> are better Friends to him than Principles: for nothing more <hi>confounds</hi> the Reader, which is all he looks after; and to <hi>confound</hi> him
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44996:208"/>
with a shew of <hi>Distinguishing,</hi> which Nature intended for a way to <hi>clear</hi> things, does it with a better grace. The same work he makes with the word [<hi>Traditionary</hi>] and, tho' he were told what we meant by it <hi>First Letter,</hi> p. 8. and <hi>Second Letter,</hi> p. 52. yet 'tis never acknowledg'd, but he still runs his <hi>Division</hi> upon it, as if it were some Ambiguous or Mysterious Word, till he has put the whole Tenour of the Discourse into <hi>Confusion.</hi> Once more I tell him, and desire the Reader to witness it, that he already knows what we distinctly mean by those words: and, if he will not acknowledge it and speak to the Sense we give it upon our assurance that we <hi>never took</hi> them, nor ever will take them <hi>otherwise,</hi> he speaks not to <hi>me,</hi> nor gives a word of <hi>Answer;</hi> but, as baffled men use, runs for shelter to meer Brabbles and Impertinencies.</p>

And <hi>Now</hi> that is,<note place="margin">P. 105.</note> after he had laid Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for his Principles, he comes <hi>to give a Clear and distinct Answer to our Demonstration of the Infallibility of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> And no doubt by Virtue of such Grounds he will do wonders. Mr. <hi>G's</hi> discourse was distinguish't by me in my First Letter p. 8.9. into four parts or Propositions; of which, the First is, that <hi>All Traditionary Christians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the same to day which they did Yesterday, and so up to the time of our Blessed Saviour.</hi> Now he knows that by <hi>Tradition</hi> we mean an <hi>Immediate Delivery,</hi> and this from day to day; for it would not be <hi>Immediate</hi> if it were at all <hi>Interrupted;</hi> and by [<hi>Traditionary</hi>] those who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd this Rule of <hi>Immediate Delivery</hi> and do <hi>Actually</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the say to day which they did yesterday; and that, if they do not this, they <hi>desert</hi> this <hi>Tradition</hi> by <hi>Interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Immediate Delivery, and so <hi>cease</hi> to be <hi>Traditionary Christians.</hi> All this he already knows for it has been told him over and over: Whence he cannot but <hi>know,</hi> tho' he thinks not fit to <hi>Acknowledge</hi> it, that the Proposition is <hi>Self-Evident,</hi> and plainly amounts to this, that <hi>They
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44996:209"/>
who believe still the same do still believe the Same;</hi> and the word [<hi>Traditionary</hi>] was only made use of to express those Persons in <hi>one</hi> word, because it had been tedious still to use so <hi>Many.</hi> Could any man but this Gentleman undertake to combat a Proposition so formally, which is <hi>in Sense</hi> Identicall and <hi>Self-Evident?</hi> I took him to be one who would own his <hi>Humane Nature</hi> which obliges every man to assent to such <hi>Clearest Truths,</hi> and so vainly <hi>hop't he had nothing to say to it.</hi> But, as he says very true, <hi>I was mistaken:</hi>

                     <hi>for</hi> he <hi>has many things to say to lay open the Notorious Fallacy of it in every Clause.</hi> How? <hi>Every Clause?</hi> Why, there's but <hi>one</hi> Clause in the <hi>Whole;</hi> for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd words [<hi>and so up to the time of our Blessed Saviour</hi>] are the most Essentiall part of it, and distinguish <hi>Christian</hi> Tradition from that of Hereticall Traditions begun since Christ's time.

But, now come the <hi>Notorious Fallacies.</hi> Why did I not say that <hi>All Christians are Traditionary?</hi> Or that <hi>All Christians have gone upon this Principle</hi>? Because many are <hi>call'd</hi> Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans especially by him,<note place="margin">P. 106.</note> who have <hi>deserted</hi> this Principle, and so have no Title to be call'd <hi>Traditionary:</hi> But prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, because if we speak of <hi>True Christians,</hi> that was the thing to be <hi>Concluded;</hi> for those men are not <hi>such,</hi> who <hi>Disacknowledge</hi> a Way of knowing Christ's Doctrin, which is <hi>prov'd</hi> to give them Absolute Certainty of it.

After these Noble Performances,<note place="margin">P. 106.107.</note> he falls into his old track of <hi>Dividing</hi> and <hi>Subdividing,</hi> he talks of <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from the Word of God,</hi> from <hi>the Guides of the Church,</hi> he runs to Infallibly holding to Tradition, (not spoke of <hi>Yet,</hi> but <hi>following</hi> in the Argument) he tells us they <hi>may go upon another Rule</hi> &amp;c. Anticipating thus all the following discourse, and complaining all is not prov'd <hi>at once,</hi> when as we are as yet but at the very <hi>first words</hi> of the Proof.

                     <hi>It supposes falsly</hi> (he says) <hi>that the Change in Faith must be so sudden and Remarkable,</hi> whereas it was <hi>Graduall,</hi> and so <hi>to pitch upon such a Precise and Narrow Compass of time is very Unreasonable.</hi> Lastly, to Illustrate and compleat his Answer with an Instance, he tells us, that <hi>by the same Method one may demonstrate it to be Impossible that any Language should be Chang'd.</hi> By which we may gather that Dr <hi>St's</hi> Incomparable Skill in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, and deep Inspection into the Natures of Things, makes account that <hi>Truths</hi> are of the same Nature with <hi>Quantitative</hi> Things or <hi>Bodies.</hi> All <hi>Corporeall Motions,</hi> amongst the rest <hi>Sounds</hi> or <hi>Speaking,</hi> have a Thousand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate Degrees between any two determinate Points. Does he think 'tis so with <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Falshoods?</hi> Or does he imagin the Thoughts of the Christian World could take a Walk of two or three Hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Is</hi> and <hi>Is not</hi>? Did he never hear that <hi>Truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist

in an Indivisible,</hi> that he thus compares them to <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titative</hi> or <hi>Divisible</hi> Natures, and judges the Comparison so apposit? Putting then once the true Notion of the Points in the Head and Heart of the Christian Church, (and, if they were never there the Apostles lost their labour) the <hi>least</hi> Change in it must change the <hi>Point.</hi> Did he never reflect why a <hi>Tenet</hi> is Metaphorically call'd a <hi>Point?</hi> And that 'tis because a <hi>Point</hi> is <hi>Indivisible</hi>? The putting in the Proposition [<hi>to day</hi> and <hi>Yesterday</hi>] is to express the <hi>Immediateness</hi> of Tradition. Others, amongst the rest the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> and many of the Fathers, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> call it [<hi>Delivering down by Hands</hi>] and the hands of the <hi>Children</hi> must be <hi>Immediate</hi> to the hands of their <hi>Fathers,</hi> else the one could not <hi>receive</hi> what the other <hi>Delivers.</hi> Nor do I, or any man living, know how, if the whole Church should be in an Errour but <hi>one day,</hi> by deserting the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> they should ever retrieve <hi>True Faith</hi> again, having forsaken the only way to it. Of such consequence it is that the Means of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down Christ's Faith be <hi>Immediate,</hi> even <hi>from day to day.</hi> And thus Dr <hi>St.</hi> has <hi>begun</hi> to answer Mr <hi>G's</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, by keeping such a huge pother about a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition <hi>Evident by its own Light,</hi> and pretending more faults in it than even a wise man could have shown in the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantest Falshood.</hi> But he has not done with it yet: the most Essentiall part of it remains yet behind; [<hi>And so up to the time of our Blessed Saviour</hi>] Now the Proposition speaks of <hi>Believing the same</hi> all that while;<note place="margin">P. 108.</note> and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes it with talking of <hi>Claiming</hi> and <hi>Pretending</hi> to follow it. Whence, since to <hi>believe the same</hi> that was deliver'd, is <hi>Actually following</hi> Tradition, his distinguishing Talent has afforded us two sorts of <hi>following</hi> Tradition: One which is <hi>really</hi> and <hi>indeed following</hi> it, the other is only <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending</hi> to <hi>follow</hi> it and not doing so; that is, there is one sort of <hi>believing the same</hi> or of <hi>following</hi> Tradition, which
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44996:210"/>
is <hi>not-following</hi> of it, which is still of the same Learned Strain.</p>
                  <p n="74">74. The Second Proposition is [<hi>And if they follow this Rule they can never Err in Faith</hi>] what says he to this? If they <hi>follow this Rule,</hi> that is, <hi>believe the same</hi> from Christ's time that was taught at first, do not they <hi>believe the same Christ Taught!</hi> One would verily think that this is as Evident as 'tis that, <hi>to believe the same is to believe the same.</hi> True, 'tis so, and therefore 'tis with him <hi>Self-Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently a meer Fallacy.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 108.</note> Certainly never was any Mortall Man such an Enemy to <hi>Common Sense.</hi> But 'tis his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant humour to talk big when he's at a perfect <hi>Nonplus.</hi> Well, but how <hi>proves</hi> he 'tis a <hi>meer Fallacy.</hi> Why 1. He grants that <hi>those who believe Christ's Doctrin cannot Err.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 109.</note> And is not this a rare Answer? We both grant that Christ's Doctrine is <hi>True,</hi> and consequently that who hold it cannot <hi>Err</hi>: All this is <hi>Presuppos'd</hi> to our Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so is <hi>no part</hi> of it. But our Point is how we shall know assuredly what <hi>is</hi> Christs Doctrin? Or by what Means shall we come <hi>at it?</hi> 2. He says, They <hi>might mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake in this Rule;</hi> It has been shown him, <hi>Third Cath. Letter, p.</hi> 6, 7.8.9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in many other places upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, that they could not <hi>mistake in this Rule;</hi> &amp; he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver takes notice of it in his whole Answer, and yet has the Confidence to object it afresh. 3. He says,<note place="margin">P. 109.</note> They might <hi>follow another Rule.</hi> This too has been prov'd against him, nay 'tis <hi>here</hi> prov'd in the Fourth Proposition of this very Argument; for by proving they <hi>could not innovate in Faith,</hi> 'tis prov'd they (that is the <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Vniversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) could not desert Tradition.</hi> But what a shift is the Dr put to? Do we contend <hi>here</hi> they could <hi>follow no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>? All the Proposition pretends to is, that <hi>If they follow this Rule they cannot err in Faith.</hi> What says he to this? <hi>Can</hi> they, or <hi>can</hi> they <hi>not</hi>? If they <hi>cannot,</hi> then the Rule is a <hi>good Rule,</hi> which is all we labour to prove <hi>here,</hi> the rest
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44996:211"/>
is prov'd in the Fourth Proposition. And if they <hi>can</hi> err, tho' following it then, since <hi>to follow</hi> it, is <hi>still to believe the same,</hi> the Dr must say that the <hi>same</hi> Faith tho' still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd down the <hi>same</hi> is not the <hi>same</hi> it self was at first; which is a direct Contradiction. Not one single word of Answer then to the Proposition has he given us, only he affirms stoutly 'tis <hi>Fallacious</hi> (a very <hi>Cheap</hi> Answer to any Argument that is too crabbed and difficult) but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not for his heart tell where the Fallacy lies. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion is <hi>naught,</hi> that he's <hi>resolv'd</hi> on, but he has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is pertinent to say to the <hi>Premisses</hi> or <hi>Proof.</hi> Yet, something he must say for a <hi>shew;</hi> and, so, <hi>he will shew some other ways that Errours might come in.</hi> And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I can shew him twenty more;<note place="margin">P. 109.</note> but, still, what's this to the Point? Can Errours in Faith come in while men <hi>follow this Rule</hi> of Tradition, that is while they continue <hi>to believe the same</hi> that was still taught imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before, and this ever since Christs time? This is our only business.</p>
                  <p n="75">75. Since I must now run out of the way after our Straggling Disputant, I desire first the Reader would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the Proposition he is now answering is this, [<hi>If they follow this Rule (viz.</hi> Tradition) <hi>they can never err in Faith;</hi>] as also that by [<hi>Tradition</hi>] is meant <hi>the Publick Testimony</hi> of the Church of— <hi>what was deliver'd as Christs Doctrine.</hi> His first particular way of <hi>introducing Errours,</hi> is, <hi>by the Authority of False Teachers.</hi> But was Tradition <hi>follow'd,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> while they follow'd their <hi>Authority</hi>? If it was, then the Christian Church was a <hi>False Teacher,</hi> and her Publick Testimony attested false Doctrin to be <hi>Christs;</hi> which if he holds, let him speak out, and see how all Christians will detest him. If Tradition was <hi>not follow'd</hi> but <hi>deserted</hi> when men were led by False Teachers, what's this to us? or whom does it oppose? For 'tis plainly to abet <hi>Tradition,</hi> to say that none could
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44996:211"/>
                     <hi>follow False Teachers,</hi> but they must at the same time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert <hi>It.</hi> 'Tis hard to conjecture then what he meant by alledging <hi>de Molinos</hi> unless it were to make his Friend Dr <hi>Burnets</hi> Book concerning <hi>Molinos</hi> sell. 'Tis no news that False Teachers may introduce Errours; and that that man pretended the Publick Testimony of the Church, or that his whimsies <hi>were</hi> Christ's Doctrin deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd down from the beginning, is both unheard of and Incredible. His Second way of <hi>introducing Errours,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 110.</note> is by <hi>Enthusiasm.</hi> Very well. Did the Testimony of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church tell them that <hi>Enthusiasm</hi> was Christ's Doctrin? If he says it <hi>did,</hi> he makes the whole Christian Church in some Age to have been a pack of hare-brain'd <hi>Enthusiasts.</hi> If it did not, then 'tis an honour to Tradition that they <hi>deserted</hi> it when they fell into that Spiritual Madness. His Third way is <hi>by a pretence to a more secret Tradition.</hi> But was this <hi>pretence to a Secret Tradition</hi> a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to follow the Publick Tradition of the Church</hi>? If it was not, it opposes not <hi>our</hi> Tradition but credits it. And if he says it was, then he makes what's <hi>Secret</hi> to be <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> which is a Contradiction; and the very alledging this makes him in some manner Guilty of that old Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his. His Fourth is,<note place="margin">P. 111.</note> 
                     <hi>Differences among Church-Guides about the Sense of Scripture and Tradition.</hi> I have <note n="*" place="margin">Third Cath. Letter p. 6.7.8.15.</note> already shewn him that it was impossible the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, especially of Pastours, should not know the <hi>Sense of Tradition;</hi> and, as for some <hi>Church Guides</hi> differing about the <hi>Sense of Scripture,</hi> it was equally impossible they should Err in Faith, as long as they interpreted Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the Rule of the <hi>Church's Tradition;</hi> and, when they once left that Rule, instead of being any longer <hi>Church-Guides,</hi> they became generally if they were any thing, Eminent Ringleaders of <hi>Heretical Sects;</hi> which gives a high repute to <hi>our Tradition,</hi> even by their <hi>erring</hi> when they <hi>deserted</hi> it. His Fifth way how Errour might
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44996:212"/>
come in, is <hi>too great a Veneration to some particular Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers— which made their Disciples despise Tradition in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their Notions.</hi> And were those men <hi>Followers</hi> of Tradition who <hi>despis'd</hi> it? His 6th is, <hi>By Compliance with some Gentil Superstitions, &amp;c.</hi> But did Tradition or the Church's Testimony <hi>deliver</hi> down to them these Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish Superstitions for <hi>Christs Doctrin?</hi> Or rather, would it not have <hi>preserv'd</hi> men from them, had nothing else been attended to but <hi>that Rule</hi>?<note place="margin">P. 112.</note> His 7th and last is <hi>by Implicit Faith,</hi> that is, that when a man had found a Faithfull Guide to direct him, he should submit himself to be Guided by him in things in which he could not guide himself. A very dangerous case indeed! But the Antidote to this malicious suggestion is, that the same Church that they <hi>believ'd,</hi> condemn'd all <hi>New Revelations,</hi> and <hi>adher'd</hi> only to what was <hi>deliver'd.</hi> He could have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an Eighth way how Errours in Faith come in, had he pleas'd, and That too such a one, as had done a thousand times greater mischief than all the rest put together; <hi>viz. Private Interpretations of Scripture;</hi> which every man knows has been the source of all the Heresies since Christ's time. But this being the <hi>sole Ground of his Faith,</hi> it was not his Interest to let his Readers know it had been the <hi>Ground of all Heresy.</hi>

                  <p n="76">76. But what's all this to the Point? Or how is the Demonstration <hi>lost</hi> if many men <hi>err'd</hi> upon divers other accounts so <hi>none</hi> err'd while they <hi>follow'd</hi> Tradition? Unless he proves this, he <hi>establishes</hi> our Demonstrations by his shewing how multitudes <hi>err'd</hi> who were led by <hi>other</hi> Motives and by his not being able to produce so much as <hi>one</hi> Instance of any that err'd by adhering to <hi>It.</hi> What Noise and Triumph should we have had, could he have alledg'd so many Hereticks sprung up by grounding their opinions on mistaken Tradition, as 'tis known have arisen by grounding their

With what Sense can any of this be imagin'd? The Tradition then which they went upon was Citations of some former Authors, which they misunderstood, (the very Method Dr <hi>St.</hi> and his fellow-Quoters take now a-days) or else the Judgment of a few Foregoers; of whom some might speak ambiguously, others perhaps hanker'd after their Heresy.

the Body of <hi>Traditionary Christians could not innovate in Faith but either through forgetfulness or Malice.</hi> And yet I cannot fix upon this neither; both because he names not these two defects before he shows us his <hi>other</hi> ways of <hi>Erring;</hi> as also because we are not come as yet to the Fourth Proposition where <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Stress</hi> lay, but have spent all our time in confuting the First and Second, which were <hi>Self-Evident.</hi> But, if that be his meaning as he intimates p. 112. to escape replying to the Fourth Proposition, then let him know that, whatever his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound Principles say, whoever <hi>deserts</hi> the <hi>Testimony of God's Church</hi> whether by the <hi>Authority,</hi> (or rather <hi>No-Authority</hi>) of <hi>False Teachers;</hi> or, by <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> the root of which is <hi>Spirituall Pride;</hi> or, by following <hi>Secret Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> against the <hi>Publick Authority</hi> of the Church; or, by adhering to a <hi>Sense of Scripture</hi> contrary to what <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> allows; or by <hi>too great a Veneration to some particular Teachers;</hi> or <hi>by Compliance with Heathenish Superstitions;</hi> or, by whatever other Motive, is Guilty before God of a Heinous Sin, and it must spring from some degree of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious</hi> or <hi>Bad</hi> disposition in his heart. For he cannot but <hi>See</hi> that himself or his Leader breaks the Order of the World by disobeying, rising against and preferring himself before those whom God had set over him to feed, direct, instruct and Govern him.

That a <hi>Means</hi> will bring a man to his <hi>End,</hi> who <hi>does not use</hi> it? That a <hi>Way</hi> will keep a man from <hi>Straying</hi> in his Journey who <hi>does not walk in it</hi>? Yet all these Contradictions we must be Guilty of by his leaving out the words [<hi>If follow'd</hi>] 'Tis pretty too upon review of his words to reflect on his Craft [<hi>'Tis vain to pretend that Orall Tradition will keep</hi>—] whom was it pretended to <hi>keep from any Possibility of Errour</hi>? He should have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded [<hi>the followers of it</hi>] but because he had <hi>Slipt</hi> this all along, he leaves the Sense <hi>Imperfect,</hi> and the word [<hi>keep</hi>] must want the Accusative Case after it, due to its Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Sense by the Laws of Grammar, meerly to avoid his putting the <hi>Right one,</hi> because it would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sutable to all his foregoing Discourses, which never toucht it. But, since he speaks still what Causes of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour he has shown, tho' I have already manifested, that all those Causes were accompany'd with <hi>Malice</hi> in the First Deserters of Tradition, yet to enforce our Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration the more, I discourse thus. If Tradition could be deserted or <hi>Innovation in Faith</hi> made by the <hi>Generality</hi> of Christians (for none ever said or doubted but <hi>Many Particulars</hi> might do so) it must either proceed from some Defect in their <hi>Vnderstandings</hi> or in their <hi>Wills.</hi> A defect in the <hi>Will</hi> is call'd Badness or <hi>Malice;</hi> whence, if they willfully <hi>Innovated,</hi> it must spring from some degree of

                     <hi>Malice.</hi> If in their <hi>Understanding;</hi> then it must either be in that Power as <hi>Apprehending,</hi> or <hi>Knowing</hi> Christ's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin; or as <hi>Retaining</hi> it. It could not be in the Former, for none doubts but the body of the Church, particularly the Teachers who were to instruct the Rest, did very well <hi>Comprehend</hi> Christ's Doctrin <hi>in the Beginning,</hi> and the many <note n="*" place="margin">Third Cath.

                     <hi>Clear</hi> ways <hi>Tradition</hi> comprizes to deliver it down, renders Faith Intelligible still to each succeeding Age. Wherefore since the Defect cannot be in their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing or their <hi>having</hi> Christ's Doctrin in their Hearts, it must be (if any where) in that knowing Power as 'tis <hi>Retentive,</hi> that is in their <hi>Memory.</hi> But, it was absolutely impossible the Generality of the Church should be so weak as to <hi>forget</hi> in any little determinate part of Time (by which Immediate steps Tradition proceeds) what was <hi>Taught</hi> and <hi>Practis'd</hi> a little before; or Considering the Motives to keep them firm to it) so <hi>Wicked</hi> as to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire</hi> to <hi>Alter</hi> it purposely. Therefore whatever Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency there must be in some Particulars, it could not be that the Generality of the Church should have alter'd it, or consequently, <hi>Err'd in Faith.</hi> Wherefore this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion</hi> stands yet <hi>Firm,</hi> the <hi>Premisses</hi> remaining yet <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toucht:</hi> Since he neither shows nor can show more Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Mankind engag'd in the <hi>Perpetuating</hi> the Former Faith than these <hi>Two.</hi> Add, that he does not even <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt</hi> to show that the Causes he produces can have the Power to prevail or carry it against the force of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and, unless he does this, all he alledges signifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.

                     <note place="margin">P. 112.113.</note> is, because <hi>he intends to shew in a particular Discourse, how the Errours and Corruptions</hi> he <hi>Charges on the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>did come into it.</hi> That is, we cannot have an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to <hi>Two lines</hi> but by perusing a Large Book.

and Conjecturall Descants upon them, with which that book abounds, and to be sure they <hi>Conclude</hi> the Point; which he shall never do.

it; and that the Evidence of such a Proof consisting in the <hi>Necessary Connexion</hi> of the Terms which are us'd in it, has the Self-same force whether the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> Council, had ever been held, or not; who sees not, I say, that this is a meer plausible Shift to avoid the shock of our Arguments and to run the Field by the still-necessary; and Still Friendly Assistance of his former bad Logick, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Arguing</hi> against the <hi>Conclusion</hi> instead of <hi>Answering</hi> the <hi>Premisses</hi>?

                  <p n="84">84 HItherto of Doctor <hi>St's</hi> Sins of <hi>Commission; viz.</hi> of his Groundless and Impertinent Calumnies, his manifest Falshoods against his own Knowledge, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant prevarication from the Question in every respect, and this quite thorough his whole Answer; his bad Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick laid open in many Instances, his Shifts and Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, his Paralogisms, Cavils and Contradictions. Now follow his Sins of <hi>Omission.</hi> By which I do not mean his Failing to give a <hi>good</hi> Answer to those Arguments he thought fit to take notice of; for this, as has been shewn in every Particular, would spread one Universal Blot over his whole Book; but his not so much as <hi>Attempting</hi> to give the <hi>Reasons</hi> I alledg'd to prove them, or other particular Omissions charg'd upon him, <hi>any</hi> Answer at all, or taking the least notice of them.</p>
                  <p n="85">85. To begin with my <hi>First Catholick Letter,</hi> or the Answer to Dr. <hi>St</hi>'s First Letter to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> Why might we not know the <hi>particular</hi> Reason <hi>how</hi> Mr. <hi>T</hi> came to be satisfy'd;<note place="margin">First Catho.

Why did he turn it off to Mr. <hi>G.</hi> to shew that the Doctor's Protestants <hi>have not</hi> Absolute Certainty of <hi>their</hi> Faith,<note place="margin">P. 4.5.</note> when as he had taken it upon himself to <hi>shew</hi> they <hi>had</hi>? but instead of giving a Reason for that carriage of his, to deny his own express words (<hi>First Letter, p.</hi> 7.) which put the Proof upon Mr. <hi>G.</hi> and then, to turn Absolute Certainty of his Protestant Faith, which consists of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Number of Points,<note place="margin">P. 6.7.</note> into Certainty of <hi>Scripture</hi>;
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44996:218"/>
which perhaps may not signify so much as <hi>one</hi> Point of Faith, unless he shew Absolute Certainty that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it is <hi>rightly understood</hi> in those Texts that contain those Points? which he is so far from shewing that he not so much as goes about it. Why no Reply to our Proof that Mr. <hi>G.</hi> has, by doing his own work, at the same time perform'd what the Doctor would needs have put him upon;<note place="margin">P. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>viz. prov'd</hi> that Doctor <hi>St</hi>'s Church has <hi>no</hi> Certainty of <hi>its</hi> Faith? Why conceal'd he the true Meaning of the word [<hi>Traditionary</hi>] given by us,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> but took it purposely in <hi>another</hi> Sense, and then <hi>rally'd</hi> upon it?<note place="margin">P. 8.9.</note> Why no notice taken of our Explication of those words [<hi>If they follow'd this Rule</hi>] declar'd by us to mean the [<hi>Believing still the same</hi>] which had forestall'd his ill-grounded Descant upon them (<hi>p.</hi> 108.109.) and why no regard to that most Important <hi>Conditional Proposition,</hi> but starting aside to ways how Errours might come in by <hi>not following</hi> it; which instead of Answering, asserts and makes good our Tenet?<note place="margin">P. 10.11.12.13.14, 15. &amp; p. 33.34.35.</note> Why no Reply to our seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Reasons</hi> brought against his intollerably bad Logick, shewing at large from many heads the absurdity of it, and that the Subject of our Argument, as impugn'd by his Instance, was not at all like <hi>Zeno's</hi> denying of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which Reasons had <hi>prevented</hi> and utterly defeated his pittifull Defence of it here? Why nothing to the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable force of our Argument,<note place="margin">P. 18.</note> manifesting it to be <hi>Self-evident</hi> that Tradition is a Certain Rule? Why does he not justify his palpable Prevarication from the whole Question laid out at large &amp; prov'd against him,<note place="margin">P. 21.22.</note> 
                     <hi>p.</hi> 21.22. Why not a word of Answer to my Discourse shewing Absolute Certainty &amp; Infallibility to be the same?<note place="margin">P. 23.</note> Why does he no where distinguish himself &amp; his Protestants from all sorts of Hereticks owning the same <hi>Common</hi> Rule;<note place="margin">P. 25.26<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> by shewing us by what <hi>Particular</hi> Means he is <hi>more</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the <hi>True Sense</hi> of Scripture then they were, and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44996:219"/>
thence <hi>differenc't</hi> from them by his having some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Rule or <hi>Way</hi> to arrive at True Faith which they <hi>had not</hi>; This being a Point of the Highest Importance in our Controversy, and most Earnestly prest upon him o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and over? And yet for all his flourishes about <hi>Crite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions</hi> he has said nothing to those Reasons, only he has made a sleight Discourse of his own, <hi>p.</hi> 53.54. but never shew'd any particular Means securing his Party from Erring, more than the vilest Hereticks us'd. Why little or no regard to my <hi>Reasons</hi> shewing that Scripture Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretable by their private Judgment of Discretion is not the Rule which the Generality of Protestants rely on;<note place="margin">P. 26.27.28.29.</note> which, if true, utterly overthrows his whole Pretence to That for his Rule? He blunders indeed about it in clear words, and tells his own Tale very prettily; but he has not answer'd my <hi>Reasons,</hi> as the Reader may discern, who is pleas'd to compare them with his Reply. Lastly, why no Answer to each particular Proposition of my <hi>Short Discourse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 30.31.</note> or shewn it inconnected, demonstrating that <hi>none</hi> who follow'd <hi>his</hi> Rule can have <hi>Assurance</hi> that what they believe is <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Doctrin</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But instead of this Duty, bringing pretended False Suppositions against the <hi>Whole,</hi> which suppos'd nothing but that we could have no more Reason to judge the <hi>Socinians</hi> Insincere, or Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, or less Skilfull in the Sense of words than we have to think <hi>He</hi> is?</p>
                  <p n="86">86. These are his <hi>Omissions</hi> in Answering my <hi>First Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Letter.</hi> As for my <hi>Second</hi>; since his Title pretends an Answer to them All in Generall, and he referrs us to another able to speak <hi>for himself,</hi> meaning his <hi>Reflecter,</hi> we are to imagin he makes account he has Answer'd them All, by Himself or by his Proxy, But, good God! what an Answer has that weak man given us? His Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is a <hi>Chain</hi> of <hi>Sand.</hi> 'Tis a mess of Controversy dish't up in Sippets; a meer Hash of Repartees, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44996:219"/>
torn into Raggs. A <hi>Discourse,</hi> as every man knows, has it's true Force by the <hi>Constant Tenour</hi> of it; and this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is shatter'd all to pieces by a new invented Method of short <hi>Dialogues</hi>; where he makes me, at his pleasure, say as little at a time as he lists, and he plays upon it as much as he pleases: I must <hi>break-off</hi> just where he thinks fitting, and he <hi>Enlarge</hi> against an imperfect Discourse, unassisted by it's Comparts, as long as he Judges conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. Now he's at the beginning of my Book, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately at the Middle or End of it; gathering thrums-ends of little Sentences, which he patches together so aukwardly that they have no Connexion at all but what his unskillfull or Partiall hand bestows upon them. If we expect Reason from him, he tells us he never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to <hi>Prove</hi> but to <hi>Reflect.</hi> A very pretty come off!<note place="margin">P.</note> I wonder what Answer is proper to a man who <hi>proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> nay not so much as <hi>Vndertook</hi> it! Thus much for his Method: But the Tricks and Shifts in managing it are Innumerable: 'Tis almost as easy to determin how many words may be made of the four and Twenty Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as to trace all the Anagrams he makes of my Sense, by weaving it in <hi>his</hi> loom to sute his own Fancy or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest. When our Question is only about a <hi>Certain Rule of Faith,</hi> he alters it when he lists, to a <hi>Certain Rule of Life (p.</hi> 33.) as if we pretended Scripture <hi>not Clear</hi> in <hi>Morall</hi> Points: by which means he turns the whole Question to a quite different Subject. His Contradictions are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, for he never speaks of the Nature of any thing that concerns our Dispute but he constantly falls into that ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverable lapse. As he turn'd the precise Duty of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> into the Needless Impertinency of <hi>Reflecting,</hi> so tell him of Falsifications he tells you (<hi>p.</hi> 52.) he meant them for <hi>Ironies.</hi> And, indeed his whole <hi>Reflexionary</hi> (if I may call it so) is nothing but a continu'd Irony; it being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to know when he's in Jest, when in Earnest:
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44996:220"/>
Only he garnishes his <hi>Scorn</hi> with demure pretences of Charity and Civility, that so he may affront his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary with a more plausible Garb of Affected Gravity and Godliness.</p>
                  <p n="87">87. As for the strength of his <hi>Reasons,</hi> since one <hi>Instance</hi> is held by Dr <hi>St.</hi> and him a Competent Answer to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Demonstration,</hi> I hope one pregnant Instance how he quite misses the whole matter in hand, may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd sufficient to render insignificant his <hi>Hopping</hi> and <hi>Skipping</hi> Dialogues, by shewing plainly that his ill-le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd <hi>Reflexions</hi> hit not <hi>me,</hi> but <hi>Squint</hi> aside to other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. E're I come to my Instance, I desire the Reader to bear in Remembrance (for I cannot repeat it too often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause my Adversary is resolv'd never to take notice of it) that, Our Controversy <hi>Supposes</hi> as agreed to by both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that Christ's Doctrin is <hi>Divine,</hi> and that our <hi>Whole</hi> Question is about the Means to bring down to us those <hi>Sublime</hi> Spiritual Articles of Christian Faith, with such a <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Clearness</hi> as may oblige us to assent firmly and unalterably, that what we hold concerning them now at present is the self-same that was taught by him and his Apostles; and consequently is <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>True.</hi> Next, we affirm that the Letter of Scripture not being <hi>Clear</hi> to people of all sorts looking after Christ's True Doctrin, in those Texts which relate to such High Points, the best way to satisfy such men that those Articles came down invariably from Christ is the <hi>Humane Authority</hi> of the Christian Church. And, Lastly, that the Credibleness of this Authority is prov'd by <hi>Intrinsical Mediums,</hi> taken from the Natures of Things lying levell to our Reason, which contribute to support it from being liable to be deceiv'd or to deceive us in that affair: <hi>viz.</hi> from the Nature of <hi>Man,</hi> who being a <hi>Rational</hi> Creature cannot possibly act without a Motive or a Reason; and is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all endow'd with such and such Faculties belonging to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44996:220"/>
such a Nature; As also from the Practical Nature, &amp; High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Import of the Doctrin to be deliver'd, and the Nature of those most powerfull Motives obliging the Generality to whom they are apply'd, to transmit down faithfully a Doctrin held Divine; and, Lastly, from the Nature of divers Circumstances of the Universe. All which are laid out in my <hi>Second Cath. Letter,</hi> p. 57.58.59.60. To which nothing but a very sleight return (with many O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions) has been given us by Him, and nothing at all by Dr <hi>St.</hi> tho' these (as the Reader may see if he pleases to review them) be the most forcible part of that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise to prove the uninterrupted <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of Tradition hitherto, on which the Resolution of our Grand Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mainly depends. 'Tis enough, it seems, for such a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Reflecter, at the end of his Pamphlet, to call the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages he has omitted, amongst which are the <hi>Natures</hi> of those things, <hi>Hedges</hi> and <hi>Puddles;</hi> and <hi>close Reasons</hi> drawn from them <hi>frisking Fancies</hi>; and that's all can justly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from one who seems to be a sworn Schollar to the Great Professor of Learned Jests and Ingenious Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rications.</p>
                  <p n="88">88. These particulars concerning our Tenet, known to all that have read our Controversy, being reflected on, let's see how this Gentleman represents it, and how profoundly he discourses against us. In his 12th Page he will needs <hi>repeat</hi> our Tenet, or (as he with much For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality is pleas'd to call it) <hi>the Lesson I have taught him:</hi> which, put into distinct Sentences, he makes to be this. 1. <hi>Your Churches Authority is Human Authority. Answ.</hi> Our Church'es Authority is also <hi>Divine,</hi> and as such 'tis the Rule of Faith to those who are already Faithfull: But in our Controversy, which is about the Way for men to come to Faith, 'tis not proper to alledge any other than her <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Humane</hi> Authority, consisting of a vast Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Men</hi> both <hi>able</hi> and <hi>oblig'd</hi> to testify such open mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44996:221"/>
of Fact as is the Delivery of a Doctrin so Qualify'd by those that <hi>educated</hi> us; And the Reason is because 'till men come at <hi>Christ</hi>'s Faith they can only guide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by their Reason; whence the Credibility of that Authority must be provable by Reason against those who shall deny it. 2. He says, <hi>It has force to prove the Truths which depend upon it.</hi> Yes; it has force to prove <hi>to us</hi> this <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> that those Truths <hi>descended from Christ</hi>; but not the <hi>Intrinsical Truth</hi> of any <hi>one</hi> Article <hi>in it self.</hi> To do this is the work of <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> not of <hi>Humane Authority.</hi> 3. <hi>It has this force and concludes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such as own its Veracity,</hi> but <hi>it deserves no Assent fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Reason gives it to deserve.</hi> Well then, since we bid him guide himself by his Reason e're he admits it, will he at least admit it and yield assent to it, when Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shews him it deserves it? This is all we desire of him; and 'tis a very reasonable request in us, for it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desires he would not renounce his Reason and forfeit his Manhood. Now come his Conclusions from mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Premisses: <hi>Hence I conclude, Seeing We admit not your Church'es Authority, nor own its Veracity it proves nothing to us nor concludes any thing against us.</hi> From what Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is this Conclusion drawn? Did we ever press him to admit it <hi>blindly</hi>; the Point is, will he <hi>renounce his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> when it tells him this Authority <hi>ought</hi> to be believ'd? This is our Tenet and should have been taken in e're he had inferr'd any thing at all: but then it would have marr'd his Conclusion and his admirable Method of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king every Discourse of mine to pieces and never putting it together again, and so it was thought expedient to neglect it. His next Conclusion is, <hi>Seeing Articles of Faith depend not on Humane Authority, your Church'es Authority can have no effect on Humane Nature to oblige to a Belief of them.</hi> Where we have near as many <hi>Faults</hi> as <hi>Words.</hi> For, First, Articles of Faith <hi>in themselves</hi> or as to their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44996:221"/>
Intrinsicall <hi>Verity,</hi> depend only on the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as their Formall Motive; but, <hi>as to us,</hi> or as to our knowledge of those Articles <hi>Now,</hi> which were taught by Christ <hi>long since</hi> (which is our only business) a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive Human Authority, the most strongly supported of any that ever was in the World to convey down a matter of Fact of Infinit Concern, is the properest way to <hi>Attest</hi> them; whence all those Articles, <hi>in that regard</hi> do <hi>depend</hi> on that Human Authority, after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as even himself also holds the <hi>Book of Scripture</hi> does. Secondly, What an Incredible Folly is it, not to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between those Articles which were <hi>Taught at First,</hi> (and, so, are Divine) <hi>as in Themselves,</hi> and the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles as <hi>Knowable by us Now</hi> to have <hi>been Taught Long ago?</hi> nor to reflect that our Controversy only treats of them under this latter Consideration? Nor to know that, <hi>as thus Consider'd,</hi> All Articles of Faith not only <hi>May</hi> but <hi>Must</hi> necessarily <hi>depend</hi> on <hi>Human</hi> or <hi>Naturall Means,</hi> since without <hi>Such</hi> they cannot be introduc't into our understandings connaturally, nor by any way but by Immediate Inspiration, which is perfect <hi>Enthusiasm?</hi> Nor Lastly, not to advert that even the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, in <hi>some</hi> sort, on <hi>Naturall</hi> Means? St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us <hi>Faith comes by Hearing;</hi> and, if so, then Faith <hi>depended</hi> on <hi>Hearing</hi> as to its coming to be <hi>Known by us.</hi> Nay, as Christian Faith was <hi>Formally from God,</hi> it depended thus on <hi>Miracles,</hi> which could not be known to be such but by their being <hi>above the Course of Nature;</hi> nor could they be known to be <hi>above the Course of Nature</hi> unless the course of Nature <hi>it self</hi> had been <hi>fore-known,</hi> the Knowledge of which is only <hi>Naturall</hi> or <hi>Human.</hi> Thirdly, His follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words in this Ridiculous Conclusion, shew him ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ignorant of our whole Question; otherwise he could not with any degree of sincerity have put it upon us, that we hold the Human Authority of our Church ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44996:222"/>
to a Belief of the Articles themselves; whereas what we hold is, that it only obliges us to Assent they <hi>came from Christ,</hi> or were inerrably <hi>deliver'd</hi> down by the Churche's Testimony. Fourthly, By leaving out all mention of what's most particularly our Tenet in this Point, he puts it upon us to hold that Human Authority has effect upon Human Nature <hi>of it self;</hi> whereas we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver presum'd or affirm'd it either <hi>had</hi> or <hi>ought</hi> to have <hi>any</hi> but by Vertue of the <hi>Reasons</hi> which vouch't for its Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, nay, I both <hi>Affirm'd</hi> and <hi>Prov'd</hi> the direct <hi>Contrary.</hi> His Third Conclusion is, <hi>Seeing all its Credit depends on its Intrinsicall Reasons produc't, till they be produc't we are not bound to give any Credit to it.</hi> No, nor bound to <hi>mind</hi> them much it seems, nor <hi>Answer</hi> them fully <hi>when produc't;</hi> as appears by his omitting the most forcible Reasons for the Certainty of Tradition's Continuance as was Lately shown. But why is this made a distinct Conclusion or disjoynted from the rest, whereas it was the most neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary and Essentiall part of our true Tenet? Because the Method he so Religiously observ'd throughout his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue-Answer, which is to shatter asunder the intire Sense of every passage, would not allow it. His Fourth Conclusion is, <hi>When these Reasons shall be produc't, its Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony has but the Nature of an Externall Motive, not of an Intrinsicall Ground.</hi> Answ. <hi>Intrinsicall Ground</hi>? To what? To Christian Faith as 'tis <hi>Divine</hi>? 'Twas never <hi>pretended,</hi> nor can it belong in any regard to our Question, since 'tis not <hi>disputed</hi> between us, but <hi>Acknowledg'd</hi> by us both, that Christ's Doctrin is <hi>Such.</hi> Means he then 'tis not a <hi>Proper Medium</hi> to prove Christ's Faith <hi>deriv'd</hi> to us who live <hi>now</hi>? How can he even pretend to shew that so vast a Testimony is not proper to <hi>Attest</hi> a Notorious <hi>Matter of Fact, viz.</hi> what Doctrin was <hi>Deliver'd</hi> immediately before, and this throughout every Age, Year, or Day? Again, what means he when he says, <hi>Testimony is not an Intrinsicall
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44996:222"/>
Ground?</hi> What man in his senses ever said or thought it? We spoke indeed of <hi>Intrinsicall Grounds</hi> to prove the Credibleness of that <hi>Testimony,</hi> but not a word have we even hinting that <hi>Testimony</hi> it self is an <hi>Intrinsical Ground</hi> to <hi>any thing.</hi> If he will needs be talking Nonsense let him take it to himself, and not put it upon me. Lastly, why is not an <hi>Extrinsicall</hi> Ground or <hi>Testimony</hi> prov'd to be such by <hi>Intrinsicall Reasons</hi> sufficient in our case? This <hi>should</hi> have been shewn, but for this very reason 'tis not so much as taken notice of either by him or his Master. In a word, he uses <hi>some</hi> of our <hi>words,</hi> taken asunder from the Context of our intire <hi>Sense;</hi> then blends them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusedly together on any fashion, without any kind of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or respect to the true Question; he gives us <hi>Relative</hi> words without telling us what they <hi>relate</hi> to; he puts upon us Tenets we never advanc't or held, but the direct <hi>Contrary.</hi> And the witty Gentleman would still persuade his Reader he is <hi>Repeating his Lesson I have Taught him,</hi> when as all the while he deserves more then a <hi>Ferula</hi> for his rehearsing it <hi>wrong,</hi> or rather saying it <hi>Backwards.</hi> Then follows his Grand Conclusion as the Flower of all the foregoing ones, which we may be sure hits the Point Exactly; <hi>And therefore</hi> (says he) <hi>either your Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion overthrows your Churche's Authority, or It your Position.</hi> Most Excellent? My Position is about <hi>Tradition</hi> which is the <hi>Self-same</hi> thing with the <hi>Churche's Authority;</hi> and this precious Scribbler will needs have the same thing to destroy it self. A fit Upshot for a Discourse without sence.</p>

And, does he think I have nothing else to do but to stand <hi>Rectifying</hi> still what he all along takes such Care and Pains to put into <hi>Disorder?</hi> Especially, since those few things that are pertinent, are abundantly spoke to in my <hi>Third Catholick

The Omissions in answering my <hi>Second Catholick Letter</hi> are as many as that Letter it self contains: since his untoward Method renders all his Talk, Twitching and Girding at little sayings of mine, utterly insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.

And the Reason is, because, should should he do this as he ought to do, he must necessarily make the Church Infallible, and rely upon her Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for the Certainty of Scriptures Letter; and should it come to be <hi>prov'd</hi> that 'tis easier to transmit down the <hi>same Doctrin</hi> than an <hi>Exact Copy,</hi> this would oblige his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Enquirer to be led by her in <hi>matters of Faith.</hi> A conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendence not to be submitted to by his Fanatick Friends; both because their First Principle is to think themselves wiser than the Church; as also, because to prove this would make the Knowledge of Christ's Doctrin too strong by <hi>Proofs</hi> and <hi>Outward Means,</hi> which their <hi>Gifted</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd</hi> Genius (impossible ever to be prov'd but by doing Miracles) cannot away with.

To <hi>Answer</hi> is to <hi>Solve</hi> the <hi>Arguments</hi> of another, not to find fault with his <hi>Conclusions</hi> and make Discourses on his own head; a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod which any Judicious Reader may observe runs tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough his whole Book. Whence I am not ty'd to <hi>Reply</hi> to such Impertinent and Irregular Prevarications; but only to <hi>defend</hi> and stand by my <hi>Reasons;</hi> and 'tis a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Condescendence, not a Right due to his Carriage, that I have reply'd to them at all; since my Arguments, according to the Laws of Disputation, must be granted to <hi>stand firm</hi> 'till they be <hi>overthrown.</hi> Yet, notwithstanding I was not oblig'd to humour his Illogical Proceedings, I do not know of any thing that is Pertinent and of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I have over-past; and I could have spoke it with more assuredness, had he quoted the Pages in my Letters all along as I did in him, especially when I cited him; but he would not expose himself to that disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, lest the Reader should by that means be directed still to my Discourses themselves; and comparing them with what he had said to them, see how <hi>Frigid, Indirect.</hi> or utterly Insignificant his pretended Answers were. Tho' I say I know of no <hi>such</hi> passage omitted, but what
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:44996:228"/>
has been already reply'd to and forestall'd in my former <hi>Letters,</hi> or in <hi>Errour Nonplust,</hi> yet, in case he still contends I have, let him single out those which he judges the strongest, or any page in this Answer of his own which concerns the Certainty of Faith as we treat of it, that is of <hi>Christ's Doctrin as 'tis Knowable by us at this distance from his time,</hi> and I do promise him a very punctual Reply to each particular Passage, one by one. He would much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige our Readers and mee too, if instead of <hi>Answering</hi> he will needs fall to <hi>Arguing,</hi> he would please to pick out what's most Pertinent and Weighty, and let each single Point be debated <hi>apart.</hi> This would give a far Clearer Light to our Readers: And for their sakes, if he will not do this himself, I shall (as my leisure serves) do it for him. In the mean time I am to demand of him publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as my Right, both a <hi>punctual Reply</hi> to the long Roll of these his important <hi>Omissions,</hi> and also a Defence of his <hi>Trifling Performances</hi>: And, in case he <hi>denies</hi> to give me and the World that Satisfaction, since none who knows him can think <hi>he</hi> wants <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> to do it, if feisible, it must necessarily be concluded his <hi>Cause</hi> wants <hi>Truth.</hi>
