            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

At the example of others, vvhere they have beene ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted vvith generall applause.</p>
            <p>THE first, (vvhich is the Protocoll Office) vvas first thought on in the first yeare of the raigne of King Henry the IV. of France, first put in practise in Picardie and Vermandois; vvhere unconsionnable persons had accustomed themselves to conceale Morgages, Transactions, Doua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and other Acts; vvhich by all Purchassers vvere deceived in their Bargaines, many good famillies and peaceable persons put to great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xations, long and chargeable processes, vvhich did often prove the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing of honourable and honest Famillies, VViddovvs and Orphans besides other mischievous accidents.</p>
            <p>The Generall States of the united Provinces did at that good example establish the said Office in their Iuridictions, and did erect the same in the most sure, regular, compleat method, as the time than did permit; did since by the continuance of able States men, reduce the same in the best and readiest forme as could be thought on; and so sure for all true Proprietaries and Purchassers, as it proved an impossibility for any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conssionable
<pb facs="tcp:35776:3"/>
persons to use any deceat in their Morgages, Transactions, Douaries, Saile or Gifts, as they vvere vvont to do, by concealing (as aforesaid) their deeds, and by passing them in severall places, and by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knovvn persons; Nor vvas it since possible for parties to be overtaken by any error, nor by shortnesse of time, for that the truth of all propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etaries rights and Estates in possessions of Lands and Houses vvas Knovvn at an instant, vvithout their cost; yet vvith their consent, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvayes not: for that no persons are permitted to vievv the Records, but vvith a ticket subscribed by the Proprietary, vvhich he gives to the party that is minded to purchasse (or to put forth his money on a Morgage) only to vievv the records, vvhen he is fully agreed on Conditions vvith the said party.</p>
            <p>THE Purchasser (as said) being himselfe the discoverer of the State of the case, vvith ease and safety freeth himselfe of all disputes, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, and processes: VVhich discovery is vvith the least discredit possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to proprietaries; vvhen it vvas othervvayes by the recours had to common Roules; besides that all Acts vvere but confusedly (as in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hos) put into the said Common Roules, vvhich is to serve only as for a Iournall.</p>
            <p>The Records of this PROTOCOLL Office (vvhich is a particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord) are in number ansvverable to the Parishes in the City and Tovvn vvherein the Office is erected.</p>
            <p>THE Records are great Books of the largest paper, consisting of 300 leafes and no more, to shune confusion; every leafe bearing in cheefe the name of the Proprietary of Lands and Houses, in such order as the Houses stand in the City or Tovvn.</p>
            <p>THE leafe bearing the right vallidity, vvorth of the pocession, and any Morgages thereon, Dovvaries, Gifts or any act soever.</p>
            <p>THE Enroulment is immediatly after the signing and sealing of deeds; and after the entring of such acts in the Common Roules.</p>
            <p>IF any Propietary, Heire, or Purchasser obmits the enroullements of his Succession, Gift, Saile, Transport, Morgage (or any other) his right is voyde, and forfaited to the State.</p>
            <p>THIS publicke security is a bate to all Purchassers, and to all persons desirous to put forth a stock of mony, and to secure them against all frauds and incombrances.</p>
            <p>THE Records are kept in a secure place from fier, and others accidents.</p>
            <p>THEIR Keepers are payed by yearly Stipends, proportionnable to the number of Books in their managing.</p>

the Nederland Provinces under the State generall; It's the public Cash of all Negotiants, vvho (to free themselves of the continuall receite, and payment of monyes, vvhich takes so much of their time as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves too prejudiciall in their affaires) Keepe in Banco (as they call it) a constant stock, vvithout any charge or cost to them, thereon to make their Assignations, and to raise their Credit by a public fame, of the considerable stock by them Kept therein.</p>
            <p>Experience manifests, that in the said Bench (vvhich is the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle of a great Tresor,) remaines continually a vaste ussesse stock of monny; of vvhich the Aministrators of the Bench do (vvithout any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty) put to gaine a great part, and that they can do it vvithout dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, experience hath manifested the same divers times, that though they put forth great part of that Stock vvhich layeth uslesse in the Cash-yet doth the said Cash remaine so vvell provided, as that the Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants are readdily served, vvhen they call for their monny: This hath often been made apparent, vvhen Negotiants had been mis-informed by ill grounded brutes (raised by malicious and ignorant persons) concerning the point of Trust, in the Administrators of the Bench, that they resolved to put it to a Triall, by dravving at one time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
