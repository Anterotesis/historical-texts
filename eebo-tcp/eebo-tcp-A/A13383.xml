            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It is a high question, by reason of the excellencie of the ende depending on the same. It is Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, bicause of the necessitie of Procreation. And it is of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, for that it includeth all things within it selfe. High, because it concerneth the felicitie of Man. Difficult, because <hi>Socrates</hi> himself could not resolue vpon the same. And of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, for that being once married, it is (then) too late to repent. It is high, because the thrée Uertues, <hi>Politicall, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> and <hi>Economicall,</hi> are comprehended in the same.

for that it determineth and clearely sheweth the qualitie of the life to come. To conclude, it is high, for that such haue discoursed in praise of the same as cannot lie: It is difficult, because Matrimony is not counted blame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> worthie: and it is of importance, by reason it serueth as a meane to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that eternall blessednesse, for which we all hope.

               <p>We ought to take the example, and follow the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of those whom the worlde hath accounted for the wisest: and such a one <hi>Thales Miletius</hi> was not only reputed, but also held to be the first man that had the name of wise attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted vnto him: being afterward reckoned one of those seuen who only wer of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Grecians called wise men: he being impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned by his mother <hi>Cleobulina,</hi> to take a wife whilest he was young, alwaies answered her, that it was yet time enough: and afterward being growne in yeares, and vrged by her more earnestly, he told her, that it was (then) past time, and too too late. This graue man meaning hereby, that it was not good to marry at all. Then let not vs marry, except we will martyre our selues for euer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bias, Prieneus, Bion</hi> of <hi>Boristhenes,</hi> and <hi>Antistenes</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian,</hi> being demaunded of their friends what kinde of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man they should chuse for their wife: they all thrée with one consent answered thus. If thou marry one that is faire, she will grow to be common: If one that is fowle, she will waxe


<pb facs="tcp:18723:5"/>
loathsome, and become to be a corsie vnto thée. As if they ment to aduise such as requested their opinions herein, not to take any at all, of what condition soeuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theophrastus</hi> a great Philosopher, and successor in the Chaire of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> was of conceit, that if any man wold take a wife, it was very necessary for him, to be maruellous rich, and with all lustie, healthfull, and of a strong complexion: and that the woman he should marry, should be faire, of good behauiour, and a gentlewoman borne: yet his especiall aduise was, that although a man might happen of such a one so wel qualified, if he were wise, he would not haue him to venture on her for feare of a further daunger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Epicurus</hi> alleaging that more purgatories then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures were to bee founde in Matrimony, disswaded men likewise from the same. <hi>Pamphilus Saxius</hi> was of the same mind: affirming that the more faire &amp; learned women were, the more daintie we men should make to wed them: because euery co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie bringeth his discommoditie: and euery thing excellent, is not without excessiue &amp; vnspeakable pride. Then if in this case we rather couet libertie then bondage, if we would liue quietly and not contentiously, if we wil be counted vertuous, and not wantons, if we loue to be frée men, and not slaues, and if we will seek what is good, and shun what is bad, let vs (then) let such alone, with whom being (once) yoaked, we can neuer be quiet. If we will not be defiled, let vs touch no pitch: if not polluted, let vs not handle filthe: and if we meane to liue pleasantly, let vs neuer marry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mirthus</hi> the Philosopher, famous in the olde time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the auncient Sages in <hi>Greece,</hi> rendring a reason why hée did not betake himselfe vnto a wife, saith thus. If (quoth he) the Woman on whome I should light, should chaunce to be good, (as tis twentie to one the contrary) yet must I loose her in the ende whether I will or no: If shée should be badde, I must beare with her perforce: If poore, I must supply her wants &amp; necessitie: if rich, I must support her


<pb facs="tcp:18723:6"/>
pride and insolencie: If foule, I must loathe her: and if shée be faire, I must kéep a watch and guard ouer her: and (which is worse then all the rest) I must (said he) resigne, and make a déed of gift of my libertie, vnto a person, that would neuer séeke to please my humor, nor once content me. But there is no man whatsoeuer, but loueth and looketh to receiue thanks and kindnesse, where he hath bestowed and done good turnes and courtesies, nor any one but gréeues and laments to be troubled with the foresaid plagues and passions. Then to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape them, let no man marrie, except he meane to marre him selfe for euer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> writing vnto the Tyrant <hi>Corynthus</hi> his friend, who had requested him to set downe his censure, what qualities one should séeke to finde in a woman that he ment to marry withall, returned him this answere: First, shée must be rich, that thou maist haue wherewithall to liue in shewe and carrie a port: next, she must be nobly borne, that thou maist be honoured through her blood: then she must be yong, that she may content thée: then faire, that thou néede not to hunt after other game: and lastly, honest and vertuous, that thou maiest not take the paines to prouide a spie to watch her. And (quoth he) who without these conditions taketh a wife, he were better be quicke buried, then otherwise wedded: giuing vs to vnderstand hereby, that there is none more right<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly vnfortunate indéed, then such a one as is not maruellous charie and warie in the chusing of his wife. But as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to finde a shée, that hath all these good properties in her, so it is most manifest, that this worthie Orator, did not alledge and bring them all togither to no other end then me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to giue vs to vnderstand by the consequence aforesaide, that most wretched &amp; vnhappie haue such bene, and alwaies are, that haue heretofore had, and now haue betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto this bitter swéete Marriage: and so to conclude, shall we be, if we shall like blinde men, stumble into this intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Labyrinth of Wiuing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18723:6"/>Heare me O ye people of <hi>Megara</hi> (crieth out the sage <hi>Sosacius.</hi> Certainly most pestilent things are Women, and yet neuerthelesse it is not possible to liue without some one mischiefe or other hanging on our elbowes, séeing that both to marrie, and to liue without marriage is ill.

               <p>Then to place a wife at his side, as a iust scourge and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement for so gréeuous a fault. Which interpretation, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though at the first apparance it séemeth to bee meant other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> séeming as it were of a more higher nature: yet is it not so rightly taken in another sense, but that I can bring the same to serue my purpose most fitly, (if others shall applie it after the same way that I do) to serue their turne: And if first they wil remember that the reason only, why the handes of <hi>Prometheus</hi> were tied with a King of Iron, and afterward that he was bound to a great stone, the auncient and learned sort would giue vs to vnderstand thereby, that the King, from that day forward should signifie the <hi>Hieroglificall</hi> state of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony: séeing that by the same (as a most necessary ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) it is continued stil by them, and vsed (at this day) by vs in weddings: they differing from vs in this point onely, that whereas at the first, their King was of plaine Iron, in which was put some base or simple stone, of litle or no value at all, we giuing our selues to new fangle wantonnesse, and to the vanitie of our time, wil haue ours wrought most curiously, with the most richest and pretious Iewels that can be found in all the world. Besides <hi>Puhagoras</hi> iudgement is, the King doth import, nor meane nothing else, but bondage, slauerie, and hardnesse of life. Such then as shall consider of these circumstances, may easily call to minde this last interpretation: (and <hi>Tacitus</hi> being as wel of this opinion as my self, &amp; <hi>Sappho</hi> and <hi>Hesiodus,</hi> agréeing with vs in the same) to be verie neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and not much varying from the purpose at all: which if it bee so, it then consequently followeth, that not anie one that is in his right sences, ought to séeke to marrie:


<pb facs="tcp:18723:10"/>
because it is the naturall propertie of all that liue, to desire and procure their owne good: and contrariwise, to detest and abandon, that that is ill for themselues, as this should be for any man, that should venture to enter into this troublesome state of life.</p>
               <p>Lastly, <hi>Philemon</hi> the comicall Poet, vsed to say that he did not much maruell at him, that had once ventured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vpon the seas, but he did excéedingly wonder at him, that comming safe to lande, returned againe thither: nor so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise at him that was once married, but at such a one as had more then once tried that fortune: it séeming vnto him, that as it was an ordinary and light matter to commit an errour for want of experience, so likewise was it more then incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beastlinesse, that any should be so sottish as to thrust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe afresh into a giddie maze of infortunes and miseries: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing experimented the same, not a litle vnto his cost most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly before.</p>
               <p>Yet that learned man alledged not the same reason why he wondred at second marriages, of whom <hi>Pontanus</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, who being demaunded of <hi>Caron</hi> why he married not againe, séeing he had so good fortune in his first choyse: answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, because he well knew, that what was rashly begun, sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or neuer happened twise well done: secretly inferring hereby, that to take a wife was the Act of a hairbraine, wilde, and rash fellow. Which Act we will not allow our selues: meaning not to accost, no not as much as to the first Bridale, to auoyd and shun all such procéedings as are not seconded and borne out through the priuiledge and authoritie of Uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue her selfe.</p>
               <p>But let vs now leaue all these antiquities aside, although procéeding from the most learned and wisest men, and come to sound reasons, and right Philosophie: for by the same, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting chiefly of two points, will Iorderly proue, that we ought not in any wise to marry. First, for the base indignitie and corrupt wickednes of womens nature: and secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause


<pb facs="tcp:18723:10"/>
so many mischiefs happen vnto their husbands, throgh their ouermuch selfe-wild folly, and too too péeuish froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>Beginning then thus: I say that all such Creatures as are mortall, doo participate and take of their sexe or kinde, not only in what is Indiuiduall, as wel of good or euil (whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such being the humane nature, it suffereth likewise these qualities) but it is a most cleare case, that Man, being the Act and Forme, as (indéed he is) doth follow, and take what is good: and so by this reason, the woman is made of that part that is worst. Now if the nature of good, is to auoyd (as much as lieth in his power) from what is badde, surely then ought Man to renounce and abiure Wiuing and Marriage: and not affect the same in any wise.</p>
               <p>Uile and abiect (and not alone and simplie vnderstood) are all such things, that haue not in themselues, their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per endes. But such a one is Woman, who was created for Man, as witnesseth Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and therefore imperfect and vile: as being not framed for any other respect or vse, then for a Receptacle of some of our Excrementall humors: stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vs in the same stéed, as the Bladder, the Gaull, and such other vncleanly members of our bodie doth vnto vs, and no otherwise. From whence then I maruel, can any pleasure or delight spring rightly from her?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auicen</hi> writeth (disputing of these questions, whose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is allowed as authenticall, by S. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi>) that if you consider some one thing, you shall finde that the same hath not within it self, his substance or essence, the truth, nor the necessitie: but if it receiue the same outwardly, and by other meanes, you shal perceiue the Opposites of th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>se, to be proper vnto it: in such wise, as it wil fall to take the name of <hi>Non Ens:</hi> of that that hath no being: of False, and Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: as the terme of Darke or Obscure, is attributed vnto the the Aire, by reason of the borrowing and helpe, which it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of Light: shewing by that meanes cleare and bright.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18723:11"/>Now this being graunted, I applie it thus: The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that hath no being, but only what is giuen vnto her (as it were of Almes) from the ribbe of Man, shall without doubt fall vnder this infamous consideration of such a <hi>Non Ens:</hi> being Nothing, or a thing without substance.

                  </gap> thus. What thing soeuer is borne by chaunce, besides the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and meaning of Nature, is a foule fault, a wicked vice, or a hatefull monster, the same not consenting vnto ought but to that which is best, and more perfect in their kinde, which is Man.</p>
               <p>But then by this Argument, a woman (that as <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Peripatetickes,</hi> affirmeth) is so borne, must néeds be a Creature, imperfect, corrupt, and defiled. Let vs not then bathe our selues in such foule puddles.</p>
               <p>After the same maner is Woman borne, through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Uertue <hi>Operatiue,</hi> or the working power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as Monsters are brought forth through defect, or throgh superabundance of matter, then is she borne <hi>Per Accidens:</hi> but these <hi>Accidentall</hi> things, are by the Philosopher compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a litle before vnto the aforesaid things that haue no being. And that this <hi>Ens</hi> may be changed from good to bad, and from badde to good, <hi>Aristotle</hi> teacheth <hi>Eudemius</hi> the same: And so by this rule, a Woman, and Badde, shall be (after a sort) <hi>Synonimas,</hi> and by this meanes, the one should import and be of as much force as the other. Euery Woman would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly bee a Man, as euerie deformed wretch, a goodly and faire creature: and euerie Idiot and Foole, learned and wise: but all naturall instincts and motions, moue and bende from imperfect, to what is perfect: and from what is lame &amp; wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, to that which is ful &amp; oueraboundeth: so the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by this rule, the same woman is conuicted of imperfection &amp; defect: she is lothed of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> man that hath knowne her before carnally: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as she on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, loueth the place where the fact was first done, as well as the man: this being a most manifest proofe of


<pb facs="tcp:18723:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a great losse vnto him, and a signe of a kind of gaine or digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnto her. Then an vnworthie and contemptible thing is a woman. She is the particular influence of the Moone, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the constitution and complexion of her bodie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable vnto the same: and by the fulnesse and emptinesse of both of them all at one time.

                  <pb facs="tcp:18723:12"/>By the Conuersation, Use, and touching, the Nature of things oft times are so strangely altered, as they receiue new habits, nouel customes, and forreine qualities, quite repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to that which is their owne. The salt turneth that into his nature, wherwith he is couered. One of the Graihounds of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> loathing to follow the Hare, leapeth into the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redge pot.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Origen</hi> affirmeth, that the Hunter draweth vnto himselfe the nature of brute beasts, instéed of better game.

But he that taketh a wife, liueth inseparably with a woman, and is with hir so strictly vnited, as it is impossible to be more. Then how shall such a poore soule do with himselfe, to be frée from enuie, from feare, from frowardnesse? and how can he escape from committing a thousand worse faultes then these be?</p>
               <p>And to be briefe, how may we more apparently perceiue and know this insufficiencie and vnhappinesse of this vnluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie Sexe of women, then in this onely, that God hath not vouchsafed to haue made and formed woman after his owne Image and likenesse, as he hath done Man: either absolutely vnderstood as it pleaseth <hi>Theodoretus, Senerianus,</hi> and <hi>Gagne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> to interpret the same, because of the authoritie, prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence and rule, which he hath &amp; holdeth in this world, aboue all other liuing Creatures: as we read in <hi>Genesis,</hi> and in <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Ephesians:</hi> or respectiuely ment, according as <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> noteth vppon the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> (inlarging so much more this libertie and authoritie spoken of before) affirming, that euen in the verie soules and mindes of vs men, Nature hath infused much more vigor and force, then in the vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table kind of women.</p>
               <p>But let vs come vnto our Argument. The contrarietie


<pb facs="tcp:18723:12"/>
of effects, as well naturall, as such as are vnderstood by Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, shewe to be contrary in their beginnings, and alleadge (in their Authors) causes for the same: as <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Topickes,</hi> in his <hi>Politickes,</hi> and in his booke intituled <hi>de Celo,</hi> setteth downe the same to be so. Now <hi>Paule</hi> commaundeth, that in the time of prayer and preaching, Man should stand with his head bare, and that women should kéep their vailes still ouer them: and not alone in Churches, but as well in all other publique assemblies and congregations: alleadging no other reason for suche difference distinguished betweene them, then because that men are the Images and glorie of God: which if it be so, then say I, impossible it is that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man should bee the same, séeing she is forbid to vnshadowe and vnbare her head. And if there be any that by some other kind of interpretation of this diuine Image, shall go about to proue woman to bee worthie of some part of the same, I assure you for certaintie, that verie hardly or neuer can they bring it to passe, to come so neare to bee counted the verie Image of God, (to vse <hi>Bonauenters</hi> owne proper termes) as we haue done, as well because of the probable distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the foresaid Doctor <hi>Angelicus,</hi> alleadged before, as also in respect of that which we shall héereafter heare of that worthie <hi>Alia<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Neither dooth this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne any thing that we haue said, bicause that in the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the first man, it is said that God made both man &amp; woman: taking their Arguments from thence, that therefore there cannot happen betwéene them Anterioritie of times, nor principallities or degrees in their endes (as the Schoolemen terme it): and lesse dooth it hurt vs, that it is set downe in the seconde of <hi>Genesis,</hi> that before the Creation of the Woman, God himselfe saide (hauing respect vnto the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the world) <hi>Let vs make Man a Helper like vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if from those words wee might inferre, that they being both of one and selfe same qualitie, should therefore be


<pb facs="tcp:18723:13"/>
(both) either like good or bad.</p>
               <p>As concerning the first Obiection, I answer with <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,</hi> in his sixt Booke, intreating of such a matter, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> in that place speaketh of Women <hi>Potentially,</hi> or rather <hi>Causually,</hi> or <hi>Seminally,</hi> (for such is his owne phrase) and not <hi>Actually,</hi> as he doth when he treateth of Man.</p>
               <p>Which thing well appeareth by the incompatibilitie (as I may say) of the words that were spoken, by which the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient figure of <hi>Plato</hi> might be renewed and allowed againe. This soueraigne Historiographer, Lawgiuer and Captaine of God, meaning by this word <hi>WOMAN,</hi> that from her the Uertue <hi>Productiue</hi> was included within Man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as by the effects following, we are satisfied more at large.</p>
               <p>As for the second, we denying the Consequence, I will shewe the reason why I doo so: affirming, that amongst like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of things, there is no necessitie that the similitude should hold in euery point, but rather that it chaungeth and turneth for the most part amongst those of diuers kindes, according vnto some conformitie or proportion of the same: as if we should say, that science changing, to that that is to be knowne, were like vnto the sense, with that that is sensible: or rather the eye being in the bodie of Man, resembled the minde with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the inward soule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Topickes,</hi> setteth vs downe such Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and such. Likewise doth <hi>Hilarius</hi> in his Treaties, where he discourseth of <hi>Sinodes,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> where he disputeth against the <hi>Democriti.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Augustine</hi> sheweth the same with examples, of Egs, of Stares and Hennes: with Wheate and Branne. And <hi>Sistus</hi> the <hi>Sanesi,</hi> with the Oliue, and the wilde Hollie Trée.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chrysostome</hi> alleadgeth in proofe of this, the resembling varietie of beastes, comparing them vnto Man, sinning di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly, We sée also the like by the Names that are attributed vnto God in the sacred scriptures, one while giuing him the

               <p>And to be short, Saint <hi>Aquinas</hi> defineth the same in the first Chapter of his first <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>omb, by the relation of Equalities, not alwaies imbracing the endes. So that, I confessing (as I haue done before, and now still doo) the Communitie of the Woman with Man, in her formall and specificall being: and so <hi>per Consequence,</hi> in the <hi>Edentitie</hi> of the ende: I say and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme againe, that by so much she commeth behinde him, by how much as she is imperfect.</p>
               <p>And know, that whosoeuer for all this will most insolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ouer saucily, vphold this second poynt, besides that, he shall fall into the errour of the <hi>Audiani,</hi> (who were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that God had a bodie fleshly and mortall as we haue, by reason of the likenesse of his owne shape which he had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated vnto vs) hée shall likewise be forced to confesse by the same Text, that there was no distinction of the Sexe, betwéene Man and Woman: for otherwise, <hi>Moyses</hi> and Christ, should iumpe and agrée in Nature and fulnesse of Grace: seeing it is read in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> that Christ (as then) should come and descend from <hi>Moyses,</hi> for so <hi>Moyses</hi> himself did affirme.</p>
               <p>Amongst all Creatures then, as well <hi>Intellectuall,</hi> as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall</hi> and mixt, Man, onely possesseth (I say Man by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, distinguished from Woman) certaine Excellencies and Honours, which alone raise him to that height of greatnesse as you haue heard before: which moste willingly I woulde héere set foorth, if it were fit time and place so to doo, as indéed (now) it is not. Yet is it a verie good place, and fit time to wonder and admire at the ordinary presumption and audatious boldnesse of these vnworthie women, who too too malepert and insolent, dare with theyr Brazen and bolde faces, venture to call themselues mens Companions: as also to bewaile and lament the common ignorance and blockish simplicitie of vs men in this poynt, that without

hauing any orderly respect at all vnto our owne worthinesse and woorth, wee doo still so seruily and abiectly abase our<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues, as to yéelde vnto these deuouring and painted sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, daining to strike saile so low, as to stoupe to our <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish inferiours: when not only (besides what is before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated) God himselfe in <hi>Genesis,</hi> moste manifestly placeth them vnder vs: as likewise dooth Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> in his first Chapter. So dooth Saint <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Colossians</hi> charge them, to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> willes them, and to the <hi>Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> commaunds them to be obedient and to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnto vs.</p>
               <p>And the selfe same Apostle writing vnto the two last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Citties, addeth: that woman was created for Man, and not Man for Woman, and that Man is the Head of the Woman, as our Sauiour Jesus Christ is chiefe ouer the Churche: shall wee then bee head ouer some of the members, as ouer the handes, ouer the féete, and ouer the rest? and shall the same goutie foote be so sawcie, or so selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited, as to perswade it selfe that she is as good as the head? Because then the wife becomes as a mixt substance with him whom shée weddeth, (euerie one of them as a new <hi>Salmare,</hi> with her Hermites, renuing daily <hi>Hermophradites</hi>) shall therefore, that which is taken (which is the Woman, come to be equall with that which taketh, which is the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band? Forsooth no.</p>
               <p>And so in like maner, shall not the bodie be of lesse account, and lesse noble then the soule, although assoone as she inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth and incorporateth her self in the same, they both liue and loue so entierly togither, neuer parting at all one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as the wife doth oftentimes from the good man) but liue vnited togither vntil death them depart? I think it shall be so, and that great difference is betwixt them.</p>
               <p>Then (worthie Gentlemen) let vs rowse our selues out of this drowsie sléepe, shaking these base conceits of subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from out our mindes, and let him that is a Man,


<pb facs="tcp:18723:14"/>
shew himselfe by this absolute power hee hath, to be such a one indéed, nor let him henceforward part stakes, with that which God willeth he should kéepe wholie vnto himselfe: I meane this honour and glorie due vnto him, bestowing it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these women so farre vnfit and vnméet for the same: for who shall so do, not onely sheweth himselfe vnworthie of so great a gift, but also not a little offendeth the Almightie one, who is the giuer of the same. And let her that is a woman, suppresse and kéepe downe her shamelesse pride, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold rashnesse, and not with aspiring Lucipher, presume to arrogate that place vnto her, to which she is not called: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, she is like to receiue like gréeuous punishment as hee did, allotted vnto her for the same foule offence. Neither must she repine nor grudge, if she haue not so high a place as man hath, since the Angels themselues want the same, and yet are they content with their state in which they liue, they knowing that it is in the hands of the Potter to make ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, vnto what vse he pleaseth. Therefore let her be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and thinke she is well vsed, to be placed in the second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée, I meane betweene man and vnreasonable creatures, which is (of right) her roomth, taking the name, either of a childe new conceiued, as is the opinion of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> or else of one lesse, of a Demie man, after the aduise of <hi>Auerroies.</hi> Neither let them thinke, this strange, or that they be hardly handled herein, when as <hi>Plato</hi> writeth after much considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and studie had about them, affirming in the ende, hee could not find betwéene them and the brutish beasts, any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant distinction at all.</p>
               <p>But (perhaps) some will thinke I roue too much at large, therefore I will (now) come vnto my other promise, one of the chiefe pillars and groundes of mine argument, which was of such euilles, as women, either by their owne selues, or by reason of such children as they bring vnto those too too carelesse and vnwarie husbands, who too vnlucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chance vpon them: which last poynt I will not handle as I

               <p>For what woman is she that marrieth, but before her husband can come to take the <hi>Assay</hi> of her sower swéetnesse, hath not wearied and tired him with her cheating and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niketching so many toyes and bables, to furnish themselues withall, as wée sée now adaies in euerie one of their kinde (in a maner) to weare about them, they making their bodies to shew like a Pedlers shop of new fangled deuices: this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a most manifest signe, and an infallible token of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie lightnesse &amp; wantonnesse of mind? what new spouse is she, that scarce hath bin two daies in her husbands house, but will straight (as if she were a Princesse) make new laws and orders; that wilnot find fault with his estate &amp; liuing; that wil not curse her father in law, &amp; raile on her husbands mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that will not set her husband and his brethren togither by the eares; that will not wrangle with his kindred; go to cufs with her maids, and abuse her men with tearms, scarce fit for villaines: and lastly, is so loftie and proud, that euery thing stincketh in her nose? What is she, but that at her first comming, with her ribald inuentions, &amp; false and forged sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions, doth not depriue her husband of his oldest &amp; dearest friends, they being the best part of his owne selfe, making him to hate and detest such as do most dearly loue, honor and account of him?

               <p>If thou commit the charge and gouernment of thy house vnto her, shee gréeueth and crieth out that shée is ouermuch troubled, groaning as it were, to haue so heauie a burthen throwne vppon her: if thou doest not commit the managing thereof vnto her, shee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth that thou darest not trust her: if thou ridest about thy businesse abroade into the Countreys, shee then sayth, it is an excuse and deuise, onely to shunne and flie from her companie: and if thou stay not still spending thy time idlely by her, as no wise man will or ought, except hee be out of his wittes: why then thou hast quite forgotten and abandoned her for euer: if thou kéepest within doores, shee imagines thou doest it to watch her as a spie: and if thou goest abroad, shéele thinke thou canst not abide her: if thou bee troubled with any thing in thy minde, shee affirmeth, that tis nothing but malice thou bearest vnto her: If thou eatest not, she suspects nothing shée doth can content thee.</p>
               <p>Sléepe thou soundly, shee then thinketh thou art wearied with hauing taken thy pleasure somewhere else. But if thou sléepe not, then tis because thy minde runneth

Stay out more then thy wonted houre about some earnest matter, she perswadeth her selfe, that then thou art a wenching. If thou fallest sicke, then she banneth and curseth, swearing that she is brought into an Hospitall; and let her fall sicke indeed, or be but sicke of the sullens, then must thou in despite of thy teeth, be ill too for companie: so much must thou turmoile and take paines about her. If she gréeueth, thou must gréeue too; and if she put finger in the eye, thou must weepe too for good fellowship; otherwise she roreth out like Bull of a <hi>Basan,</hi> that she seeth very well thou doest hate her, that thou canst not abide to stay by her, and that thou thinkest long till she kick vp her héeles, and make a die. And to conclude, shee will neither say nor doo any thing but all by contraries, such and so vile is their peruerse and Diabolicall nature.</p>
               <p>Now if to these gréeuous and insupportable behauiours, we shall adde the heauie crosses of their continuall alarums of discontentments and brawles; why then these be ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the crosses of these miserable men: and these iangling peales do they ring continually vnto them.</p>

               <p>So likewise, either her owne mother is liuing, or not, and if thine be dead, then shalt thou finde thy selfe to be in a shrewde peck of troubles: for then hast thou no bodie to teach her how to gouerne thy house and familie, to learne her how to conuerse amongst her equalls: Thou hast none fit to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her, nor any with whom thou maist trust her in thy absence, or when she shall be abroad.

to foyle too much, and make her ouer labour her selfe, she hath not bene vsed vnto this hard kinde of life, that she hath not: you must let her goe abroad when shee pleaseth to take the freshe aire, you must make much of her, and see that shee want nothing, for I knowe her nature well enough by mine owne, shee is as good and as louing a Childe as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Woman bare, a faire word getteth any thing at her handes, but if you vse her a little vn<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For I my selfe haue found the experience, and sée the same daily in other Women, that to holde their tongues, and to suffer and beare what theyr hairebraine Husbands say

and do, is the only cause that maketh them to be vsed so bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and villainously by them: whereas contrariwise, I finde that there is none of vs liue so merrily and more at hearts ease, then suche as stand stoutly to their tacklings, resist as carelesse, and make least account of their husbands. And this is the godly lessons she learneth vnto her pretie and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly daughter.</p>
               <p>Now if graue mothers themselues giue such ghoast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counsell vnto theyr forwarde Children, what shall wée thinke of these Launderers, of these common Gossips, of these counterfayt puritane Dames, and such like homely stuffe as vse to haunt vnto euerie house, and by that meanes cunningly insinuate and créepe into the fauour of our wiues and mistresses?</p>
               <p>Let any man but consider within himselfe throughly of the matter, and hée shall quickly finde into what daunger he bringeth himselfe, that giueth leaue and libertie vnto such light huswiues, to haue egresse and regresse into his house, suffering them to haue daily accesse thither.</p>
               <p>But, doo but once restraine these filthie Baggages from thy doore, and forbid them any more frée enterance into the same, (Lord) howe thy Wife will then take on, she will swell lyke a Toade, sweare like a Cutpursse, and braue thée to thy face like a Smythfield Russian: affirming shée is vtterly disgraced and discredited, disparaged, and scandalized: and shée will take the matter so hotely, and so highly in the nose, as for a while shée will neyther speake nor answere vnto thée, as if shée were growne dumbe and deafe on the suddaine.</p>
               <p>Besides, as I sayde before of thée, so say I of thy Wife, that shée must bee either riche or poore, both which are passing badde: for if shée bee a Begger, and thou not verie riche, then must you both smart for the same: rubbing out in the Worlde moste miserablie, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull hardly: And if shée bee riche, and thou poore,


<pb facs="tcp:18723:20"/>
she will then make thée starke deafe, with her continuall din and noise, making an open proclamation like a common Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that she hath made Iacke a Gentleman, and hath drawne Dunne out of the mire: that she hath brought thée out of thy lowsie ragges, into courtly silkes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that thou haddest died like a begger vnder a stall, had it not bene for her full bags.</p>
               <p>Againe, she will be either prodigall, or couetous (for their Nature knoweth no golden meane): and if she be miserable, thy whole familie smarteth for it: and they wanting, thou canst not any way haue any thing in good order: besides, thou shalt be continually disquieted, being forced to call for euerie small triflle thou lackest. And if she be pordigall, she wil squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and vainly cast away in one day, more good prouision, then would serue thy house a whole yeare: flattering euerie one of thy seruants, at thy Table and elsewhere, only to win them to be her creatures, and to bee at her commaund: and euery straunger that commeth to eate with thée, will she vse as kindly in this sort, giuing to this huswife bread, to that gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop wine: and to that she Pandresse, corn: to this man shirts, to that man bands and ruffes: and to an other, handkerchers or purses, or such like ioyes as these.</p>
               <p>In like sort, her humour must be either too too merry and ouer impudent and bold, or else too too squeamish coyish, and disdainfull. If it be of the first sort, it will make thée suspect all will not go well. And the other (out of all doubt) will doo what shall be ill indéed: either she wil haue gossipping in thine own house, vnto thy great disgrace or hinderance, or else she will go a gadding where feasts and <hi>Velias</hi> be vsed abroad: and if the one doth dislike thée, I know thou canst not be but discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the other. For among diuers other things, which euerie wise man noteth as a prognostication or token of the behauiour of a lasciuious and light huswife, he counteth the often running abroad, and the resorting from one house vnto another, not to be the least, which marke is so certaine and infallible, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, he maketh no doubt to set the


<pb facs="tcp:18723:20"/>
same downe as an effect that followeth all such loose widows as haue violated and broken their faith, vowed vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary not long before.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, thy wife must either hate thée or loue thée, imagine which of these thou wilt, for as the one will soone kill thée, so the other will as quickly be reaue thée of thy life <hi>Phaedra</hi> louing, caused <hi>Hippolitus</hi> to die. And <hi>Clytemnestra</hi> hating, wrought the destruction of <hi>Agamemnon</hi> her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
               <p>Shée, must be either a Widowe or a Maide, the elder of which, will haue the customes and the fashions of her first husband to stand (as it were for a lawe) vnto him whom she new marrieth: and the younger knoweth not how to carrie her selfe any way in good order, and so oftentimes through this defect, she shameth her selfe, her friendes, and her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
               <p>To be briefe, they will be either barren or fruitfull: and hap, what hap can of these twaine, nothing can happen but ill vnto thée: séeing that if she be a barren Doe (leauing apart to set downe that that happeneth for the most part, by reason of their vnholsom complexions, alwaies subiect to one loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some disease or another) thou art depriued of that conclusion thou didst hope for, of the helpe thou didst assure thy selfe of, and of the stay thou diddest beléeue thou hadst prouided and prepared to bee a reliefe vnto thy weake and drouping olde age: besides that, to thy vnspeakeable griefe, thou seest a strange heire to enioy thine own goods: yea and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thy mortall enemy to succéede thée, whilest thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdest most plainly and as it were in a Glasse, the very lowe waine, and vtter downfall of thy whole linage and stocke: thine owne name and thine auncient House, with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie and remembrance of all thy Predecessors and thy last selfe, to be extirped and extinguished in thine owne death for euer. But say thou haue children, then is there no plague, hell, nor Purgatorie, that is comparable, either in qualitie or


<pb facs="tcp:18723:21"/>
quantitie, like vnto thine. For all such troubles, griefes, passions, bitternesse, and sowre incombrances which we haue heretofore shewed, that Man can bee plagued withall, by reason of want of issue, are but pastimes, sportes, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and delights, in respect of this: because that one procée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from an intrinsicall, a straunge, and only one cause, or occasion, but this is deriued and commeth from many: for many children may we haue by our owne selues, which are our owne flesh and blood, and the verie <hi>Quintisence</hi> of our substantiall loue (as I may say) towards them.</p>
               <p>And to come to the purpose (letting passe that whilest they lie as Infants in their Cradles, or as litle Children runne vp and downe the stréetes, continuall conceits come into our heads, and daily feares of some notable mischaunce or other that may happen vnto them, either that the Nurse is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of them, and so they come to a mischiefe, or else by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their excéeding charges in the bringing of them vp, the troublesome noyse they still kéepe, crying and bawling day and night) no sooner are they commen to yeares of discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but if they bee Maides, (and thou a right carefull father for them) thou neuer commest home againe without suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or feare, that one or other, either will steale secretly in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, or hath alreadie scraped and gotten some too too fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar acquaintance with them, thou being not ignorant how easily such Natures as theirs be, are soone intreated, and how with faire words, they are brought a bed oftentimes in fooles paradise: their héeles being so short, as they catch such shrewde falles, as they can scarce bee ridde of the swelling that commeth of the same, in fortie wéekes after.</p>
               <p>These bee the guawing corsiues, that eate the verie heart of a right carefull Father as I called thée euen now: and I vse this tearme vnto thée, onely to the disgrace of some certaine Fathers, dwelling héere in our Countrey, who only are but méere shadowes of the same: béeing of so frée and franche a minde, as they cannot onely brooke


<pb facs="tcp:18723:21"/>
that their Daughters should reuell and passe theyr time merrily all the liue long day, walking and rouing abroad in the fieldes with theyr louing seruants and swéete hearts, and in the night goe running vp and downe like a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of wilde Buckes, séeking good companie at other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours houses.</p>
               <p>But they themselues, euen in theyr owne houses, giue them leaue and libertie to daunce vndecent and shamefull Daunces, and to haue secret conference in priuate and suspitious places with whome they list.</p>
               <p>And as I may say of these Fathers, so are there as badde Mothers, who being left widowes by their deare husbands, and Stewardes of mountaines of wealth, for theyr owne good, and to the aduancement of their Children, not only spende vainly and prodigally their owne, but also that which is bequeathed vnto their poore Orphanes, growing in their olde yeares into such miserie and want, as they become litle better then Palliardes vnto theyr owne Daughters, and so vtterly vndoo themselues and theyr Children too, being a most vnconscionable and vnchristianlike part, and not to bee suffered in a godly Common-wealth, séeing Saint <hi>Paule</hi> himselfe testifieth and pronounceth, that person to be worse then an Infidell, that taketh not care to prouide for his familie and children.</p>
               <p>But leauing such vnnaturall and barbarous mothers, to liue in this miserable estate as they most iustly deserue, with their poore children, who being vtterly ouerthrowne through such parents meanes, their innocencie and forced necessitie to lead these shamefull liues, crying out for reuenge vnto the Protector of all such abused poore Creatures, I will come againe vnto the former carefull parents of whome I spake before.</p>
               <p>And put the case as I said but now, it be the good fortune of thy Daughters, that thou canst neuer take them trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in any fault, by reason that other be appointed to watch


<pb facs="tcp:18723:22"/>
to sée thée safe, and to sée the coast be alwaies cleare: yet shalt thou neuer be frée from some one grief or another, onely if it were but for feare of scandalous reports, of badde and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tongues, in whose power it consisteth to make the world beléeue, that, that most chaste Quéene of <hi>Carthage,</hi> was but an arrant strumpet: and contrariwise, that that most impudent and adulterous <hi>Penelope,</hi> was to be counted and held for a most rare example and patterne of singular and excéeding chastitie.</p>
               <p>But now thy daughters being commen vnto yeares of mariage, it gréeues thée that none dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth them for wiues, and when they be demanded, thou art as sorrowfull, because perchance thou hast not wherewithall to giue them dowries. But say they may be married, and that thou hast money to giue vnto their husbands with them, yet hast thou brought them to be but slaues vnto others, which is no smal corsie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thée: for being maried, they are no better then seruants vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Neither is that mans fortune better y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath sonnes only, then he that hath all daughters, but rather in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit worse, by reason that men are more accounted of then women: and that a greater expectation is hoped of them, then of the other: and being put abroad into the world, they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are subiect to more mischances the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other by ods. The farther they are off from thée, the more they still do run in thy mind lest all should not be well with them. If they take any iourney, why thou then in thought doest ride with them for company, alwaies fearing least some théefe or other shuld rob or kil them. If they be Marchants &amp; vse to trafficke amongst strangers for marchandise, thou still art with them, doubting either least they spend beyond all gods forbid as they say, or els y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they may be ouerreached in making of their bargaines. If they venter on the seas, thou likewise hoysest vp the sailes of the winds of thy thoughts, lest their ship by tempest should runne vpon some rocke, least Pirates should seize on them, or least they should be drowned in the bottomlesse gulfe.


<pb facs="tcp:18723:22"/>
If they liue ciuelly, as schollers in the Uniuersitie, yet art thou carefull for them: the hard life they leade there, the sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp late at their bookes, and the ouermuch studying to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper their braines, thou thinkest will too much trouble them. Againe, thou doubtest they haue none to attend on them whilest they are in health: being sicke, that they shall be forsaken of euerie one: that they haue no acquaintance but such as hates them, nor any friend to defend, aduise, and to counsell them for the best. If they be <hi>Martialistes,</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the warres, the danger they are in to be slaine abroade, taketh away thine owne life from thée at home. If they liue with thée idlely in thine owne house, then shalt thou neuer be quiet, neuer shall sléepe enter thine eyes, neither shall thy meate at any time do thée good. For one while thou art pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue to sée how they run to Lauernes and Ordinaries, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away their money and their thrift togither: and an other while thou art perplext, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou hearest of some villainie or outrage which they haue offered vnto one man or other: now they séeke to raise scandals and slaunderous reports of some honest familie, whereby they are brought into trouble: and then againe, they fal into the profunditie of the french disease, and that doth most of all disease thée.</p>
               <p>Besides, they wil fall a quarrelling and making of fraies, and that will afflict thée: and then shalt thou heare they are committed to prison, or wounded mortally, and that will sore gall thée: within a while after, thou shalt heare (may be) that they themselues are abused, discredited and disgraced, and that stets and chafes thée: or for some hainous offence are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished their countrey, and that killes thée. And to conclude, because they fall sicke and die, and then thou louest them so dearely, as thou beginnest to despaire, running as it were out of thy right wits, whereby thou offendest both God, thy selfe, and nature.</p>
               <p>So as he that hath children, there is not a hinderance, but he hath it: not a trouble, but he is tired withall: not a


<pb facs="tcp:18723:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
griefe, but he is vexed withall, not a burthen, but he is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed withall, and not a torment but he is tormented with the same.</p>
               <p>There is no sorrow, but he is acquainted with it: no misfortune, but he is afflicted with all: no daunger, but hée is drowned in it: no annoyance, but he féeleth it: no feare, but he is scourged with it: no crosse, but he beares it: no corsie, but he tries it: no mischance, but moues him: no heart-brerking, but burnes him: no disaster, but distempers him: no passion, but pincheth him: no anguish, but doth oppresse him: no miserie, but doth molest him: and to be bréefe, no plague but doth pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish him.</p>
               <p>And therefore I conclude with a certaine anncient and graue wise man, that to haue no children, is a great good vnknowne, and perhaps the very greatest which hapneth vnto any man, whilst he liueth.</p>
               <p>So as if we should graunt, that for some other causes we ought to marrie, yet for this one onely occasion are they to be hated, and to be shunned of euery one of vs, in séeing they are the causes of so many millions of euils, which they bring forth into the world against, vs by bringing forth such vnfortunate children vnto vs.</p>
               <p>But say, that neither for those of their children, neither for the discommodities and troubles, which both through the one and the other we beare and suffer, we should not abhorre and detest this subtill sex of deceitfull euill, yet ought we so to do, were it but onely for that they depriue vs of our owne swéete naturall fréedome and most pleasing libertie, which as the Lawyers say (whose knowledge is not without the grounds of reason) we ought to prefere before our proper liues, and so true and apparent is it, that they robbe from vs the same, as it should be but labour lost to proue it by <hi>Picus Mirandula,</hi> he affirming, that husbands no otherwise owe their bodies vnto their wiues, then the soule doth it selfe vnto God: or by Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> affirming our Wiues to be


<pb facs="tcp:18723:23"/>
mistresses ouer our bodies, and not we our selues. So that it were more superfluous and vaine to bring in our senses for proofe of the same, when euery one that is so muffled and yoaked, féeleth after a certaine manner, that his hands are tied, and his féete bound: so as if a mans going bee taken away, I thinke hee can stand but with little ease.</p>
               <p>He that will not beléeue this, is as bad as a pettie He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticke: if he but call to minde the picture of matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it selfe as the most wise Egyptians drewe the same, one while painting it as man that had both his handes and his féete manacled togither, an other while repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting it with such a plaine fashioned yoake as you tie horned Oxen with all: which doubtlesse is a most mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest imprese or signe of bondage, slauerie, and continuall ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile drudging.</p>
               <p>Besides, is not that which we call Honour, the chiefe and principall of all externall good things? No doubt it is. Why then by all reason we ought to conserue and preserue the same more then our owne libertie and liues. Now he that shall (except for the inward vertues of the minde) venter as it were vpon a Mumchaunce with a false paire of Dice, both the one and the other: is not hee worthie to be quoted for a foole? I know euery one will say he is.</p>
               <p>And shall it not then be worse then grosse foolerie, and selfe wild madnesse it selfe, for any man to commit the trust and custodie of his honor vnto a woman, worse then a weak vessell of brittle Glasse, who with euerie little touch is so short héeld, as she presently falleth and breaketh? And so doth he whatsoeuer he be that entreth into this intricate Maze of mariage, after the custome, or rather to say more rightly, after the sottish ignorance of this doting age, which hath placed the Honour and the infamie of Man in the power of the dishonestie, and blacke swanlike chastitie


<pb facs="tcp:18723:24"/>
of his wife, as if the vertue and vice of others should preuaile more, and bée of more power in others, then in our owne selues.</p>
               <p>Let vs not then entertaine these venomous serpents in our bosomes, for as long as we kéep what is our owne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our owne selues, we shall not be in danger of loosing the same: the exceeding greatnesse of which euill, how mightie it is, wee may gather from hence, that the Almightie God himselfe placeth it in <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> amongst the cursings which hee allotteth vnto the transgressors of his comaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>To conclude, if this which is now our disputation, that is, whether it be fit to take a wife or no? was heretofore a question, which so much troubled the Gentils, that although (almost for what small cause soeuer, they might be deuorced from them) they were doubtfull still what to do, and could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer as yet resolue vpon what to determine: why should it not be a cleare and resolute case with vs not to marrie, vnto whom it is not permitted, for all their excéeding and gréeuous faultes they shall daily, and that most wilfully commit, to rid them away from vs, as long as we shall liue.</p>
               <p>But oh immortall God, if it be a matter so plainely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, both by the counselles, reasons and experience of the wisest and best men that euer liued amongst vs, their drift and meaning herein being none other, then to perswade vs for to withdraw our selues from such lettes as hinder vs from all humane felicitie, by shunning this sorrie go merrie daunce of married mans round: how much more ought we the rather to do the same, being inuited hereunto by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and perswasion of such as haue bene the choise vessels and elect oracles of the thrice sacred &amp; holy Ghost, whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions haue béene onely to dehort and perswade vs from those that steale vs away, entice vs from that which is diuine and eternall.

Let vs heare <hi>Salamon,</hi> who by the gift of reuelation from aboue, knew all the causes, beings, &amp; natures of euery thing, and from whose stocke it pleased Christ our blessed Sauiour to descend; who speaking of a Woman, saith, that he found her more bitter then death it selfe, that she is the occasion Man rebelleth against God, and counselleth vs not to liue or to conuerse with her, because as from garments Mothes doo procéed: so doth the iniustice of man from her, which iniustice (saith he) is yet far better then the best workes that that iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious sexe can doo.</p>
               <p>Let vs reade <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Mathew</hi> the Euangelistes, where Christ being demaunded if it were lawfull for one to repudiat and forsake his wife for any occasion whatsoeuer, and he answering no, except it were for adulterie, (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is vnderstood onely by the separation of the bedde) and by this you shall finde, that from hence the Apostles gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and concluded, that it was best not to marrie at all.</p>
               <p>Let vs looke into Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> and we shall likewise sée our Sauiour himselfe, animating men to learne and to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish these wiues, we shall heare him say, that we must néeds as it were hate them, and that otherwise we cannot followe him, neither rightly enioy him, for we find, that he that had taken a wife could not come vnto the holy supper, where that good man with other his guests attended for him: I say to that spirituall supper, most glorious and blessed, vnto which God from the beginning inuiteth and ordaineth (as much as in him lyeth) euerie one to ioyne in generall.</p>
               <p>And to this effect let vs heare <hi>Paule</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> where he will say, that it is not good to touch a woman, and he will perswade such as haue neuer bene married, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowers that haue bene wedded, to stay and liue ashe then did at that time, that is, without a wife, which he himself had had once. If the text of <hi>Ignatius</hi> who liued in his time, was not corrupt and falsified, he will aduise such as haue none, not to take any at all: and those that are married, he will tell


<pb facs="tcp:18723:25"/>
them that he pitieth them, because that first they endure most bitter stormes and troubles, and then they become too too carefull, and ouerpensiue for worldlie goods, not séeking after any thing so much, as how to please their wiues: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the same Apostle addeth, that such as are vnmarried giue their mindes onely vnto heauenly matters, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauouring most studiously and carefully how to please God.</p>
               <p>Let vs meditate and call to mind, the reuelation written by that secretarie of God, Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> and we shall find in the same, that not any of those hundred fortie foure thousand which sung new praises, knew euer any woman, and that none but such immaculate and vndefiled Innocents could say the like.</p>

               <p>Let vs come vnto Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> where he entreateth of the vnequalitie and proportion of merrits, ment by Christ, in the numbers of thirtie, sixtie, and a hundred: and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly, he will affirme, that in these greater numbers, he is comprehended that doth not marrie: and in the first and smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest, are contained such as be married.</p>
               <p>Let vs search in Saint <hi>Ierome,</hi> who besides that, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreteth the exposition of these numbers, after this maner: he moreouer auerreth this, that so much difference is there to go the nearest way vnto heauen, betwéene him that hath a wife, and him that hath none, as there is betwéene sinning and dooing of good workes: applying the first vnto the vnma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and the last vnto those that haue wiues. Likewise hée will say, that the woman is the fountaine and originall of all euill, the swift way to all wickednes, the sting vncurable of a scorpion: and to be briefe, a generation most detestable and

hatefull. But let vs a litle come backe againe vnto <hi>Origen,</hi> and we shal find, that he defineth her to be the head, or rather beginning of sin, the weapons of the diuell, the expulsion out of Paradise, the mother of all transgressions, and the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distinction of the law. <hi>Tertullian</hi> calleth her the entrance into Hell, the first bringer in of the forbidden fruite, the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the law diuine, the ouerthrow of man, whom Sathan himself durst not be bold to tempt. <hi>Chrisostome</hi> writeth, that she is the enemie to all vertuous friendship, a plague incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, abad necessarie euill, a naturall and ordinarie kinde of temptation, a sought for calamitie, a domesticall danger, a delightfull detriment and hurt: and so following on with such bad titles as these, in sequence, he reckoneth vp a huge rabble of them, amounting to the number of 600. at the least, going far beyond <hi>Aluarus Pelagius,</hi> who gaue ouer as being tired with setting downe thrée hundred of the same.</p>

kinde, I, as one resolute and resolued, conclude, that it is best for such of you as be Bachelers, to continue <hi>Celibes</hi> stil. <hi>Quasi celestem vitam agentes,</hi> and such as are married, I pray and beseech God most hartely, and desire him euen from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of my bowels, and very inward of my soule, to giue you that most needfull gift of patience whilst you are so plagued: and for his great mercies sake, either (soone) to mend them, or quickly to end them. And as for such of you as haue bin trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with these stinging waspes and incurable diseases (worse then <hi>Nolime Tangere</hi>) but now through speciall grace from aboue, are rid from them (being as it were neare come out of S. <hi>Patrickes</hi> purgatory, into S. <hi>Peters</hi> Paradise) with you, I, as wel-willer of your great happinesse, congratulate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce &amp; participate with you for your most blessed deliuerance out of that irkesome dungion of Litle Ease, and from that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile slauerie, worse then that the miserable I sraelites sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnder the tortering Egyptians intollerable thraldome and bondage.</p>

               <head>A Defence or Answere vnto the foresaid Declamation, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by that famous Poet and Orator, <hi>Torquato Tasso.</hi>
               </head>
               <argument>
                  <p>That it is good to take a Wife, and that Marriage, is both Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and necessarie.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Worshipfull Sir, and my singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar good kinsman, I first was giuen to vnderstand that you haue married a Wife, and presently vpon the same, I sawe a certain booke of yours, in which you not only blame Women, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise inueigh most bitterly against Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. And although I could wish that your writings and your déeds were equally to be praised, yet if I should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Action, I cannot rightly giue praise to the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the same; for so doing, I should disagrée as much from mine owne selfe, as your workes doo from your owne spéeches.</p>
               <p>But you (perhaps) by the one, would make some proofe of the excellencie of your sharpe wit, and by the other, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest vnto the world your constancie in loue, whereby as in the first you are to bee counted wittie, so in the last you are worthie to be commended for your wisedome: it being my part, not a litle to reioyce with you in both of them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate


<pb facs="tcp:18723:29"/>
with you as much in your praises, as in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test ioy and feasting you make for your marriage.</p>
               <p>Neuerthelesse, as neither the fragrant flowers of the pleasant spring time, nor the gréen leaued boughes of diuers coloured Garlands, bewtified with swéete Mirtell, with louely Roses and perfumed Uiolets, if they be not placed orderly, and with cunning art befit nor become all places, nor at all times: so all pleasing praises agrée not with euery age: neither are méete for euerie calling and profession.</p>
               <p>Therefore I reioyce with you in some part of your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and I condole and gréeue, that the Himenean verse, the Uirgins <hi>Corus,</hi> and the nuptial song, which most willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I would haue sung with others, are as it were troubled, disquieted, and disgraced, by reason of spéeches full of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and disgrace: whereas you your selfe (who know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so to do then any other) should haue as highly aduanced women, as you haue depressed and abased them, immitating (or rather excéeding herein, <hi>Stesicorus</hi> the Poet, who changed his note, singing a second song, quite contrarie to his first: and not doting <hi>Homer,</hi> who became wilfull blinde, not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the foule error he had (before) committed.</p>
               <p>But that which you would not doo, some elequent Gentlewoman will (perhaps) take in hand, for as <hi>Euripides</hi> saith, One woman vseth to defend an other in cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie.</p>
               <p>So all your obiections shall not alone bee refuted by her reasons, and your allegations by her arguments, but you shall be vtterly confounded by her admirable bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which is such a silent kinde of eloquence, as it is of farre more force and power to perswade euery way, then any other painted or passionate Rhethoricque whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.</p>
               <p>And if true perswasion standeth in the lippes (as it doth in very déede) in no part is it of such efficacie, nor of greater delight to the hearers, then in the mouth of a


<pb facs="tcp:18723:29"/>
faire and gracious Lady: whilest she reasoneth of her selfe modestly, and for her companions courteously, and for both learnedly, she hauing such straunge vertue in her, as all the thundring spéeches and lightning words which <hi>Pericles</hi> vsed to the mutenous people of <hi>Athens,</hi> and all the smoothe and flattering phraises which tickle the eare, and inchaunt the minde, are nothing in comparison of hers: the swéete deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of her voice, resembling a pleasing Lullabie, that bringeth a delightfull slumber vpon a man, making him glad and faine to yéeld and vaile vnto her pathenticall and enchanting discourses: neither shall she néed (as <hi>Phrina</hi> did) to vnbare the white Alablaster of her mountaine snowy breasts, in the graue iudgement place, or reuerent tribunall seate, because in this case, the weake weapons of cankered backbiting and malicious slaunder, shall hee forced presently to fall out of the hands of their spitefull aduersaries, euery tatling tongue being shut vp with the fast locke of husht silence, that dare (but once in conceit) prattle or talke ouer licenciously neuer so little against them.</p>
               <p>But I perhaps speake now with that affection, which were far more fitter at an other time, and for an other occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of which I could not as yet vntill now well giue ouer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the last garment that a wise man should dispoyle himselfe of. But as the same <hi>Euripides</hi> saith, to commend the vertue of a gentlewoman in such sort as is conuenient for her dignitie and estate, is the propertie of a wise and learned man.</p>
               <p>And could I promise vnto my selfe so much from my learning, as others might, or ought in reason to assure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of my credit, or chalenge me rightly for to stand in their defence, I would then dare to enter and venter to trie this combat with you, although you are borne and come of the selfesame bloud that I am: for these contentions are like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fained battles, fought in iest, in which it is lawfull for kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to prooue their valours one against the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18723:30"/>But as in all Courtly Justes and royall Turnaments, not any vseth to enter, but such a one as besides the pleasant delightsomenesse of his Colours, and the pomp and richnesse of his Caparisons, and the splendant glistering of his gilden Armor, carrieth likewise in shewe, the high prised fauour of his dearest Mistresse: So should not I ofright (being depriued of all such like meanes) intermeddle in this matter, and come as it were an vndaunted gallant, to braue you in your owne battell: whereupon I chose rather (for a while) to holde my peace, then by contradicting you, to write any thing: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I was as it were forced vnto the same, vpon an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of great importance (which I wil at this time conceale vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my selfe) I thought it not much out of the way, to request you to take that, in friendly wise from me, which of another (may chance) you might conceiue to be an arguing, or an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, quite against you.</p>
               <p>First therfore I exhort you (deare Cousin) that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne not against your own self, but that you so order al your actions by the Diall of Discretion, that your doctrine may be conformable according vnto your owne workes: and if you shal please to think it worthie to place this my discourse, as an Attendance or a follower of yours, you shall find that the one wil be no disparagement nor ouerthrow vnto the other. But as in one &amp; the selfesame trée, those peares which are olde are grafted with young and new peares, and as the apple, by the apple, the figge by the figge, and the vine by the vine, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and recouereth life again: so shall mine answer take life from yours, and in exchange as it were, return back the same again vnto you. And if my reasons shall in part séem contrary and repugnant vnto yours, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> shall it happen, like vnto those plants which are new grafted, vpon which not alone is séene fruit of their own kind, but oftentimes (as it were by miracle) we view y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Seruise to spring out from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boughs of the Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler trée: the Pomgranet &amp; Drenge, to grow on one trée togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and on y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> science where the white grape ripeneth, the red

begin to waxe ripe, and white Mulberies to hang by the black, all vpon one branch: Then (deare <hi>Hercules</hi>) let this friendlie kinde of Grafting be in our contrarie opinions, whilst most truely though briefely I come vnto the matter.</p>
               <p>Neither do I request this, because I would arrogate that authoritie vnto my selfe which was graunted by <hi>Maximus Tirius,</hi> to <hi>Anacarsis</hi> the Poet, for he was of conceit, that the head and as it were the top of all wisdome (contained in a perfect life) was placed in the quietnes of the minde, and comprehended in the breuitie of spéech, with which they came to touch the verie quick and pith of the matter. But I desire to take this course, not as one presumptious or ouer-arrogant, trusting vnto the excellencie of mine owne wit, but because of the infirmitie of my body, and by reason of the weakenes of my memorie, and therefore I would willinglie tie and close vp that in few spéeches, which (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise) I could if I lifted drawe out at length, and display if at large. And if by chaunce it shall happen to me as it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did vnto <hi>Anacarsis,</hi> who discoursing vpon a certaine argument, there were diuers men that all the time ranns vp and downe, making a noyse about the question, and troubling him in the deliuerie of the same, whome he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore compared and likened vnto light horsemen, and ranke riders, that flie vp and downe the Countrie: yet will I indeuour and force my selfe in such a tumult and insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of conceits, and caprichious discourses of opinions not to be troubled at all, like vnto a souldier that standeth stoutlie in his place, neuer giuing once back what violent charge soeuer is giuen against him. Although my chiefest studie hath bin for the most part pleasing <hi>POESIE,</hi> yet will I now forget the same, and in a loose kinde of plaine and familiar Prose, briefely, according vnto my promise, and to the purpose, aunswere your chiefe points obiected against women: although my selfe a Bacheler, not filling many leaues of paper with bare words only, like vnto the


<pb facs="tcp:18723:31"/>
vnprofitable blast of fruitelesse winde; remembring the old saying, that <hi>Frustra fit per plura, quod per pauciora fieri potest.</hi> And thus <hi>a Ioue surgit opus,</hi> I thus begin.</p>
               <p>I say then, that the authoritie of <hi>Thales Milesius,</hi> from whome those Philosophers called <hi>Iouici</hi> had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is not of greater priuiledge any way then that of graue <hi>Solon,</hi> who gaue Lawes vnto most of the learned Cities of <hi>Greece,</hi> with which they so many yeares most happily flourished, and gouerned their Common-wealths, making all <hi>Ionia</hi> subiect vnto them, and vtterlie (in a manner) ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing the Empire of the Barbarians; And yet this <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> had wife and children. And although reasoning with <hi>Thales</hi> (as we may reade in his life described by <hi>Plutarch</hi>) he was somewhat moued with the lamentable losse of his vertuous sonne, yet ought not we to leaue and giue ouer those things that are both lawdable and necessarie, as is this sacred Matrimonie, if by chaunce there should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen any effect contrarie vnto the desire of him that taketh a wife.</p>
               <p>But say that <hi>Solon</hi> did ouermuch bewaile the death of his daere sonne, yet did not <hi>Xenophon</hi> take on so heauilie, as to giue ouer the Sacrifice he was in hand withall, and as then about to solemnise: but hearing that his sonne had dyed honorably, he placed againe the Garland vpon his head, which vpon the first report of those sad newes he had taken off before: and for that this Philosophy is one of those that are of account, and great, with the greatest Kings and Monarks that then liued, and had commaund and rule ouer their huge and royall Armies, I sée no reason but that his authoritie should be held in estéeme, and goe for currant, more then any others.</p>
               <p>Consider what he hath written in that little booke, where he intreateth of the gouernment of a house, and you shall finde that he affirmeth how the Gods themselues (amongst other things most wisely ordayned by them) deuised this


<pb facs="tcp:18723:31"/>
easie yoke of Matrimony, first because the generation of liuing creatures should not want, and then that there might be some such as should nourish and comfort vs in our old age; And because mortall men liue not vnder the open aire, and in broade fieldes (as other creatures do) but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a shelter and in houses, it is conuenient that a graue Matron and prouident Huswife conserue and kéepe those things close and in couert, which the Husband doth purchase and get abroad.</p>
               <p>Where you bring in certaine old fragments (as reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions) of <hi>Bias</hi> and others, who sayde, If thou take a faire woman vnto thy wife she will be common, and if a foule one, it will be a pennaunce vnto thée to behold her: the same was retorted and turned quite contrarie, <hi>(All o reuerso)</hi> in this manner by <hi>Pitacus Mitalenus,</hi> who was one of the seuen Sages also, of whome <hi>Greece</hi> did so much vaunt. If (quoth he) thou take a faire woman, it will be a pleasure vnto thée, and if a foule one, why, then she will not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Or it might be answered well thus: If thou choose a faire one, thine owne wisedome shall kéepe her vnto thy selfe alone, and if a foule one, yet the loue thou bearest her, shall make her séeme pleasing vnto thée: for a wife is as other things are, which may be ill or well imployed and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, so that the prudent cariage, and warie circumspectnes of the husband, hath great interest in the chastitie of a woman.</p>
               <p>And because Chastitie is the bewtie of the soule, there is reason that a faire soule be resident and lodged alwayes (if it be possible) in a faire bodie: that very same bewtie which we sée in swéete Gentlewomens faces, being no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, then the right glittering luster, and glorious brightnes of a victorious &amp; triumphant soule, which hauing vanquished and ouercome all whatsoeuer opposeth it selfe contrarie against her, in the selfesame manner, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Sunne dissolueth and disperseth the shadowie and

gloomie cloudes, she shining with dauntlesse maiestie in the controwling eyes sparkling like Diamonds, and depain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the pleasing countenance with farre more delightfull cullers, then are those which we behold with great pleasure in the heauenlie Rainebow: or rather as <hi>Iris,</hi> is a token and signe of the atchiued victorie of the Sunne; euen so is this gratious fauour and amiablenes of the looke, a certaine and infallible argument of that of the minde: in such sort as that that is naturallie desired of many by election, hapneth (by Fortune) to be graunted but vnto one alone.</p>
               <p>Neither can the authoritie of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> which you after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward alleage, alter my beliefe in this matter, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth it more stronger, for those things that are eschewed and shunned by the bad, ought to be followed and sought for of the good: and those that are blamed of such as are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, deserue of right the praise of those that are most learned.</p>
               <p>But (perhaps) if I should procéede after this order, hardly could your fruite and mine be gathered together off from one selfe trée, but (as if they were shaken with a blustering winde) some of them would be found to lie brused on the ground, and therefore because one discourse may adde life vnto another, I will begin to graft according vnto the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise of <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> from whose counsell I meane not to swarue: for there is no doubt but that it is as necessarie for rich and sound men of bodie to marrie, as it is for such as be poore and diseased to liue without wedding at all. And yet I would not so expound his meaning, as if it should be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that of his maisters, who if he had thought that Matrimonie had bin bad, he would not then haue reprooued the communitie of wiues, with which it seemed he was much offended: neither that as concerning goods, which are as expedient and necessarie for the bringing vp of their children, nor haue giuen out that Man was a liuing creature, borne to be accompanied, and that amongst all other companies belonging vnto a priuate house, that of the Husband and of


<pb facs="tcp:18723:33"/>
the wife was the principall and chiefest: through which spéeches, being so plaine, me thinketh no man néedeth to doubt of his opinion. And after this selfesame manner, the authorities of many that you produce, may be most trulie interpreted, <hi>Plato</hi> himselfe perswading vs to bring forth children, and to bring them vertuouslie vp, in the same sort as the Lamp which is lightened, giueth light in course from one companie to another.</p>
               <p>And verily, that Poet spake passing well, that the one gaue the Lamp of life vnto the other, no otherwise then is vsed amongst vs at this day in the Galliard or Daunce of the <hi>TORCH,</hi> when the man taketh it of the woman, in whose hands it séemeth (as it were) that both life and death is reposed and placed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Musonius</hi> a Philosopher of great account, affirmeth, that weddings were the first beginners and founders of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and housholdes, so that whosoeuer goeth about to depriue man of the same, destroyeth the House, the Citie, and all humane ofspring, which cannot continue without encrease, as the right and lawfull encrease cannot be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without Marriage. For a Familie, or a Citie, are not composed of men alone, but of men and women to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Nay which is more, there haue béene Cities and Monarks found in the world, consisting onely of women, (as was that of the <hi>Amazons</hi>) but that there coulde bée an Empire or Kingdome of men without women, hath ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bin yet knowne: and therefore wée may conclude by this rule, that women are more necessarie amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and so consequently, néeding the lesse the perfection of others. And the same Philosopher sayth, that the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship betwéene man and woman is more auncient, and of longer continuance, then all the rest whatsoeuer. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth <hi>Hieron</hi> the Siracusan, differ from this former iudgement, for he will haue all our predecessors successors, to be borne through societie and companie, and that the


<pb facs="tcp:18723:34"/>
chiefe and principall of the same, are especially knowen and discerned by Marriage: for Cities cannot be without fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and such families as are not of married folkes, do want as defectious and vnperfect: for that house cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defect, in which Marriage is not, because, neither the most royallest part of the soule can be without his subiect, neither the subiect or inferiour without this which is so royall. <hi>Antipho Anasfundricus</hi> discoursing of Marriage, sayth, that a perfect life cannot continue nor be without wife and children; for that house is as well lame, as that Citie is vnperfect, in which are women alone, or men only.</p>
               <p>But (peraduenture) we haue giuen too busie and too too lowe a beginning vnto Matrimonie, seeing her originall is as it were Celestiall, beginning euen then when the soule is first placed and espoused vnto the bodie as <hi>Dant</hi> writeth, who perhaps (in this) would imitate the auncient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, of which, some affirme that Reason doth signorise and dominere in the minde, like a Father ouer his familie: as she that is most auncient and fittest euen from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of mans birth to discourse and iudge, but the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piditie or gréedinesse of the minde, being a womanish pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and ouertender of the soule, which is gentle and easie to be brought to relent, representeth a woman: and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mositie and dauntlesse courage full of aspiring thoughts, and princelie heate, as he is willing oftentimes to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient vnto the minde, resembleth a yong man, the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and concord of the same (which ingendreth and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth) being the affects of this animositie. But this cupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie or gréedinesse of minde is Definite and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and that is vneuen by her owne nature, where this is euen, although it depend vpon other things, that hauing her perfection from her owne selfe, and this being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by borrowing of others. So, then the example of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is in the Soule before it come to be in the house: so by this consequence, who so destroyeth Mariage, not onely se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parateth

man from woman, but also the Soule from the Bodie, and as it were, cutteth off from the Soule his head, deuiding it from his other parts: so as without doubt, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is a murtherer, as sayth <hi>Sperou Speroue.</hi> By the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities then of so many worthie Philosophers, we ought to beléeue that wiuing is both necessarie and good, and we must giue credit vnto Reason, who also perswadeth vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same: for if those occasions be bad which corrupt and defile Matrimonie, there is no question then, but that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage it selfe is most excellent and good: but it is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by two passing bad things, the one is Death, which is the finall ende of all euils, and is most terrible: and the other is Dishonestie, which is as it were the death of the Soule. Besides, if those things are good which conserue the same, there is no sense, but that Mariage it selfe should be good, but it is preserued by life, which is most swéete, and most desired of euerie one, and suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by modest bashfull Chastitie, the most lawdable and pretious praise-worthie vertue amongst all others in a woman.</p>
               <p>Againe, if pensiue solitarinesse be counted a miserable, yrksome, and displeasant life, then is companie happie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, and pleasing: but amongst all companies, there is none more déerer nor more ioyous, then that which is betwéene Man and Wife. If to abandon and forsake all lasciuious loue, and vnholsome lothsome Curtezans, be held an honest part, then is chaste Matrimonie honest, which is the happie occasion of the same. If it be profitable to leaue superfluous pomp and vaine expenses that bringeth too late repentance with it, then is this nuptiall band pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and commodious: and if to ende all olde grudges and auncient ciuill enmities, bringeth health and prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie both to Cities, Kingdomes, and Common-wealthes, then is there nothing more wholesome nor iust, then thys so honorable and lawfull coupling together. For


<pb facs="tcp:18723:35"/>
there can be no greater nor more vpright iustice, then to make warre and wage battell for a mans owne wife, as <hi>Menelaus</hi> did for <hi>Helena,</hi> and <hi>Cambises</hi> the Persian king, for his <hi>Notesia,</hi> daughter of <hi>Apria</hi> king of <hi>Egipt,</hi> from whome <hi>Amasis</hi> had taken away her kingdome. Lastly, none can enioy more pleasure in this troublesome life of mortall men, then to be blessed with happie frute of comfortable children: but these, eyther are not enioyd without Marriage, or else nothing so happilie, nor so lawfully. Nay, the husband is like the maister of a goodly Garden, who (at his pleasure) without feare, gathereth the morning swéete Roses, and the pearlie dewed Uiolets, but the Adulterer comming in snea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinglie in the night, opening the same with counterfet keies, and climing softlie vp vnto the trées, where he lurketh in couert, is resembled vnto a timerous thiefe, who stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth alwayes in such feare, as he can neuer (in a manner rightlie) enioy or take any kindlie vse of such things as he stealeth.</p>
               <p>Then by all these reasons Mariage is good, neither ought it to be left in any wise in the Actiue life of man, since it bringeth not (as your Cosen sayd before) trouble, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true felicitie and happines. For as the yoke can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie be drawen by one Oxe alone, so the burthen of this our humane life, cannot be sustained or borne out by Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, neither, onlie by Woman, but the one agréeing and assisting the other, it will prooue to be verie light, which of it selfe doth séeme verie heauie and grieuous: whereby wée learne, that that olde fable of <hi>Aristophanes</hi> is not altogether false, because the husband liueth with two soules, with that of his wiues, and with his owne: and discourseth and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth with two tongues, seeth with foure eyes, heareth with foure eares, laboureth and taketh paine with foure hands, so as these procéedings and actions, are easie, well estéemed of, and vertuous, where the wife doth help what she can. Neither is there any thing of the husbands so

much his, but that the wife hath also interest in the same: nor hath shée ought, but that hee hath a propertie like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise therein: séeing they are, not only Companions of the bed, but as well partners in all their other procéedings and determinations whatsoeuer: as <hi>Dien Cassius Niceus</hi> affirme, all other friendships and curt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sies being ioyned togither, lesse perfectly, and farre more vnsurely, they being resembled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a gallemawfrie of pease, or such like grosse meate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the loue of the man and the wife, is as wine mingled with water: for the liking of married folkes is diuided &amp; mingled in euery part: neither haue they only their children, common vnto them both (which is farre dearest aboue all whatsoeuer) but the soule and bodie likewise, and perhaps the vertue of the soule and bodie both alike too. So that, as they which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a swéete Garden full of many fragrant flowers, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not distinguish rightly the perfect sent of the Rose from the Lilly, nor the Uiolet from the Hiacint, nor the Gilliflower, from the Carnation, because they all at once make a kind of melodie or harmonie, of diuers swéet sauours togither, which the calmie winde and gentle aire doth breathe into their sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses on the sudden: so the prudence of a husband, his fortitude and magnanimitie, his liberalitie and his bountie are mixt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither, as one proper swéete perfume, with the pleasing sent of feminall temperance, and roseall modestie: and with the humble submisse méeknesse, and more then precious pearle, Chastitie of a modest woman: in such maner as it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be discerned, which is the one, and which is the other. And if the sacred skill of diuine <hi>Poesie,</hi> is as well in the Man as in the Woman, as we sée as much by the verses of <hi>Sappho,</hi> as by those of <hi>Anacreon,</hi> or by the learning of <hi>Bacides,</hi> as by the answeres of <hi>Sibilla.</hi> And if Painting and Musicke, is as well in the one Sex as the other, and all Arts florish in both kinds, with like and equall excellencie, then is it not vnséemly that these these vertues compared togither in the same sort as the <hi>Statues</hi> of <hi>Phidias,</hi> or <hi>Praxitiles,</hi> with other artificiall and rare


<pb facs="tcp:18723:36"/>
workes are vsed to be, should haue the selfesame Forme, and as it were the very like Caracter, without any difference at all: neither that there should be any distinction betwéene the Magnificence of <hi>Sesostides,</hi> and that of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> and the greatnesse of <hi>Pelopida,</hi> and that of <hi>Timodia.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though vertues (sometimes) are wont to take certaine differences (and as it were) liuely cullers from them to whome they do naturally belong, by reason of their brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp in the Exercises of the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet neuerthelesse this happeneth vnto Men amongst themselues, as well as it chaunceth vnto Women: for <hi>Aiax</hi> was valiant af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one fashion, and <hi>Achilles</hi> after an other: neither was that wisdome of <hi>Nestor,</hi> that which was in <hi>Vlisses:</hi> nor that prudence of <hi>Agesilaus,</hi> the selfesame that <hi>Cato</hi> had: neither did <hi>Irene</hi> and <hi>Alcesta</hi> loue their Husbands both after one manner: nor was <hi>Cornelia</hi> Magnanimous in that sort that <hi>Olimpia</hi> is sayd to be. So that hereby we may conclude, that it is not necessary diuers sorts of wisdoms, iustice or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantnes of mindes shoulde be, but we may rather auouch and affirme, that they are rather differences by reason of their vnequalities, then because of their Speties or Kinde. And though some will haue it to be graunted vnto Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that Differences are said to come after another manner and sort, yet doth it not therefore follow, that the woman should be depriued of these vertues: but if it be true that was spoken by that excellent Poet of <hi>Tuscania:</hi>

                  <l>Rare Vertue neuer comes by chance,</l>

               </lg>
               <p>Shée being endowed with all these Uertues, cannot by Nature be brought forth by Chaunce, although that in particular Subiects shée had another kinde of intent and meaning: for, otherwise shée should be rather the Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame of the worlde, then a kinde and vniuersall Mother of all such things as we presuppose and meane; her fashion

being to conserue and preserue the eternall speties and kinds equallie, as well of Men as of Women, drawing forth and painting the lap of the matter of all Formes, which are the Reasons in the Soule: and <hi>Ideas</hi> in the deuine vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as the chiefe minister of the heauenly prouidence, which hath the selfesame care of woman, as it hath of man.</p>
               <p>A Woman then is not created against the purpose of Uniuersall Nature, (nor <hi>per Accidence</hi> as the Scholemen call it) and say that she were lesse perfect then Man, yet ought she not to be seperated from him, for so should the Soule be deuided from the Bodie by this Reason, and the mixtures of one element from another, and so by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence should follow the distinction of the whole world, occasioned and chauncing by Discord, as writeth <hi>Empedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> Neither, because some women are found, through whose faults Mariage bonds are infringed and dissolued, as <hi>Clytemnestra</hi> and <hi>Helena, Phedra,</hi> and the couetous wife of <hi>Amphiaraus,</hi> with the 49. Daughters of <hi>Danaus,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the number of those that be good, the lesse, but rather, so much the more greater, by how much they were the more renowmed and glorious. For the wife of <hi>Admetus</hi> would néedes die for her husband, although she refused to lose her life for her sonnes sake. And <hi>Argia</hi> and <hi>Euadne,</hi> solemnized most royall Exequies for their bedfellowes: and <hi>Artemesia</hi> made her heart a sepulcher for her deare Spouse, the same being farre more famous and miraculous then the <hi>Mawso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum</hi> which she framed, although it was termed to be one of the 7. wonders of the world. So did <hi>Lucretia</hi> stab her selfe with a dagger: and <hi>Portia</hi> killed her selfe with swallowing hote burning coles, because their husbands might be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly assured of their faith &amp; consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie. And <hi>Ipsicratea,</hi> like to a seruile slaue in humble sort bearing of a ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning Lackies weedes and port, would be companion of the banishment and flight of <hi>Methridates,</hi> as she had bin before copartner of his pompe and glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18723:37"/>Neither haue only certaine particular women, but whole troupes and bandes of them, left behinde them most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable examples of their feminine vertues, as the wiues of the people called <hi>Tirrheni,</hi> who exchaunged their garments with their husbands, being in prison and condemned to die. And the <hi>Saguntine</hi> women, who ensued the men of <hi>Marsilia:</hi> and in our dayes, the Ladies <hi>Baptista,</hi> surnamed <hi>Saluzza,</hi> and <hi>Eleonora</hi> of <hi>Aragon,</hi> were bright mirrors of matchlesse cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie, in the Court of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and in that of <hi>Vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bino, Isabella,</hi> and <hi>Leonora Gonsaga,</hi> personages of rare mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie.</p>
               <p>I could recite diuers other examples, as well of our owne Countrey, as of such worthie women of <hi>France, Spaine, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie,</hi> and <hi>England:</hi> who haue so entierly affected their lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kid Mates, that not only they haue exposed themselues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuers mortall perils for their sakes, but haue also most willingly offered their dearest blood as sacrifice to die with them. But who is hee that can rightly set down the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlesse numbers of such stainlesse and immaculate swéet La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies? when there are so many to bewtifie the earth withall, as there be stars inafrosty night, to set out and adorn the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens withall? Neither were many of these renowmed alone, but others also of whom there is no mention made in Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.

And if it be true as it is written, that in the skies there are certaine hidden signes, besides such as are discerned by vs, about which the Sun doth take his Circle and compasse: so may the concealed vertues of Women be compared vnto these same, as more glorious and excéeding farre the others, although they display so many beames and brightnesse, as no mortall creatures else can do the like.</p>

               <p>But <hi>Crates</hi> (certainly) although he wanted both house and al other things necessarily belonging vnto house kéeping, yet would he haue a wife: and lacking a priuate place vnto which he might repose himselfe, he (poore man) tooke vp his lodging, and liued with her in the Porches of <hi>Athens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But perhaps this kinde of Philosophie is too disagrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and vnfit for a ciuill and orderly life, being as it were bannished in disdaine, not only from the Courts and Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces of Princes and Noble men, but likewise from the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Schooles and Academies also. So that, although it be a laudable course to marrie a Wife, yet ought we to leaue her or to take her, not only for her good or badde qualli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties (as some haue affirmed) but we must likewise haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard vnto the riches or pouertie as well of the husband as of the wife: for a man nobly borne, should not (by right) match with a woman whom he cannot be able, either by his owne proper goods, or with such wealth as shee bringeth of her owne, maintaine her like a Noble Gentlewoman: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we finde, that that saying of <hi>Philippides</hi> is verie pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>Thou hast (quoth he vnto a friend of his) married a rich Woman, but yet ill fauoured, and therefore shalt thou sléepe vnquietly, though thou goe gallantly and fare dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely.</p>
               <p>Nor lesse wittie then this was of <hi>Epicarmus,</hi> who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,


<pb facs="tcp:18723:38"/>
that to take a Wife, is no other manner of thing, then to play at Dice, and venter thy Fortune: for if thou chaunce to light vpon one that is courteous and well qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, thou shalt bee blessed in thy marriage: but if thou happen on one that is insolent and proude, and that will neuer kéepe within doores, thou then shalt haue not a wife, but a most intolierable misfortune as long as euer thou li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest.</p>
               <p>Let vs take them then, hauing regarde, as well vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vertues of the minde, as vnto the beawties of the bodie, and riches of Fortune: and if we cannot make our choyce as we would (and that we shrowdly doubt the worst) why then let vs leaue them.</p>
               <p>And yet would not I haue a man to mistrust ouermuch, except vpon a good ground and sound cause: For <hi>Mala mens, malus animus.</hi> An ill disposition, breedeth an ill suspition. And there are some, that because in their youthes they haue played the wilde Coltes, and gone astray into other folkes groundes, therefore they thinke their Wiues will repaie them with the same money, suffering their friends to take commons at their Tables: which as it is vanitie to thinke, so is it more follie to suspect, and greatest foolishnesse of all, to speake of the same.</p>
               <p>But to returne where we left, It séemeth vnto me ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie difficult, that this conclusion can hardly be brought to be counted as doubtfull, by any sophisticall reasons. By which also is concluded, that a woman hath some vertue, either as it is proper vnto her selfe, (as <hi>Aristotles</hi> opinion is) or else as it is common, as well to the man as to the woman, as <hi>Plato</hi> most plainly setteth downe. But yet which of these two questions we should determine vpon, by Theologicall Doctrine (the one of which, as it were a Gimmall King, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth vpon the other) I minde not now to set downe or dispute of: for so should I séeme to passe from one kinde vnto an other, and from one Science vnto a nother: and so as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending

vp vnto Diuinitie, I shall be as a straunger that scarce vnderstandeth the language of those that discourse with him, and so in the ende not be able to set downe mine owne opinion vnto them.</p>
               <p>But you <hi>(Signior Hercules,</hi> are most fortunate in this) who with the orderly Rules of the right <hi>Tuscan</hi> spéech, haue so aptly ioyned and vnited togither, so fruitefull and so copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a knowledge of all things togither, not a litle vnto your great commendation and praise.</p>
               <p>And yet (with your fauour) I will speake a word or two as concerning this matter, which when you shall so please, you may at your leisure consider of with <hi>Signior Christophoro</hi> your brother, he being as exellent a Philosopher, and as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding a good Diuine, as any liuing at this day.</p>
               <p>I say then, that in that Argument, about which both <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> are in controuersie: there is not any man of sufficient authoritie and power, to giue censure and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon the same, vnlesse he be some péerlesse Diuine: as was <hi>Basilius,</hi> surnamed the <hi>Great,</hi> who affirmeth, that the vertue of the Man and of the Woman, was all one thing, and the verie same. Therefore can none blame the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but they must likewise finde fault with the Man, by the same reason: nor praise the one, but that they must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the other in like manner: in such strict wise, are not only their Offices and Actions conioyned togither, but their verie vertues themselues, the which if they were euer distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished and diuided, the same distinction was verie wise and discréete: nay rather to speake more truer, most conuenient and necessary that it should be so.</p>
               <p>Neither is the opinion of Saint <hi>Paule</hi> any thing discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant from the same, for he writeth vnto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that the woman is the glorie of the man. And in the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same Epistle, hée sheweth the Equalitie thereof, saying that the woman hath not power ouer her owne bodie, but man:


<pb facs="tcp:18723:39"/>
and so likewise that the man hath not authoritie ouer his owne bodie, but the woman.</p>
               <p>And in another place he showeth the Dependancie (as I may say of the woman) affirming that she was made of man, and for him created: for in his creation, <hi>Eue</hi> was taken out of the side of <hi>Adam:</hi> which most vndoubted truth, might force any graue <hi>Stoicke</hi> in a manner, to laugh at the foolish and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ottish Fables and loude lies of <hi>Focilides,</hi> who wrote that a woman was formed of foure liuing creatures, of a Dogge, of a Waspe, of a Sowe, and of a Mare: of which last shee tooke her long haire. And to smile no lesse at those Tales of <hi>Simonides</hi> (who comming in with his fiue Egges, whereoffoure were rotten) dreameth that some of them are created for a Sowe, some others of the craftie Fore, who knoweth all things: neither is any thing be it good or bad, had from him as hee saieth (and by these, I gesse hée meant such as be sharpe shrowes) some others of the earth, some of the sompter Asse, othersome of a Weasell, other of Asses, but hée that hath one that commeth of a Bée, hée (saith he) is passing happie, for shee groweth to be excellent in all kinde of workes, and prooueth to be a passing good Huswife, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing her husbandes stocke wonderfully. Now were not these opinions too too grosse and ridiculous, they were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to be tollerated, and to be borne withall: especially when the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceits be such as oppose themselues not too much against most true and graue matters of great importance, as these be wherof I now speake. I say then, that woman was created of a most daintie, fine, and tender matter, because she might be the more tractable &amp; easie to yéeld vnto the commandements of her husband. Wherupon passing from y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> first question vnto the second, we may boldly say with Saint <hi>Paule</hi> himselfe, that it is better to marrie then to burne: and to take of him this good counsaile, that hée that is bounde séeke not to bee vnbounde: and hée that is loose, (if hée so like to liue still) séeke not to come into bandes: although to bée bounde

By thée came downe from heauen, loyall faith, and spotlesse modestie, and all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: nay rather thou wert the first founder of the same, thy holy lawes teaching men to take vp defensible weapons in the honor of their wiues, they learning by this meanes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come valiant. Thou taughtest others to assemble and gather togither their friends, their kinsfolkes and subiects, filling the seas with sailes and armed Nauies, and to fight many years in forren coastes, to recouer their wiues whom they had lost. And if we may giue credit vnto auncient Histories, the first famous warres which euer were first begun, began vpon this occasion, betwéene those of <hi>Asia</hi> and them of <hi>Europa,</hi> who in the end growing wearie of trauell and fearefull of farther vaungers, came to agréement, and to growe vnto a truce, in the kéeping of which, prudence and instice consisteth: for it shewed vnto many of the wisest sort, that it was not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to haue warre vpon warre, nor discord vpon discord: whilest the long absence of husbands, learned women milde temperance and graue modestie, throgh which most of them continued chaste and vndefiled amongst whole multitudes of Ruffinlike suters, and swaggering louers: and many of them through the swéete remembrance of their best beloued Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, haue shewed themselues most bountifull vnto straun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and most charitable and courteous vnto Pilgrimes and trauellers: so that what by reason of one thing or of an other, they prized their vertues at so high a rate, and so hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie carried themselues in all their actions, as they did mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister sufficient ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thou art the cause that faire Ladies in their behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours commit nothing worthie of reprehension. Thou art the roote of godlinesse, whence springeth the braunch of shamefastenesse, which is the onely defence that nature hath giuen vnto them, to kéepe their reputation, to preserue their chastitie, to maintaine their honour, and to aduance their praise.</p>
               <p>To thée then is due all commendations procéeding from modest speeches. To thée is giuen the glorie of euery good worke: and to thée is rendred all thankes for humane felicitie and happinesse, for else our liuing without thée, would be no other, then wofull miserie: heauie tribulation and gréeuous wretchednesse, world without end: but thou turnest and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertest Gall into Honey, Uineger into Wine, and loathsome bitternesse into the sweetnesse of loue, making vs all happie by thy working: sicknesses are lesse gréeuous vnto vs, aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie lesse noysome, health of body more precious and deare, and prosperitie more pleasing and of better relish, only throgh thy operation and power. Thou doest lesson sorrowes and increasest the delights of this life, making the troubles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of séeme lesse with thy mutuall consolations and comforts, multiplying our pleasures with common and ordinarie satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and amends. Thou art the occasion, that to the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime, after his long labours and wearisome iournies, his returne backe againe into his owne countrey séemeth the more pleasanter vnto him. That to the sayler after many bitter stormes and boysterous tempests, the kenning of his wished land, and the sight of his much desired Hauen, is the more dolightfull vnto him: and that vnto the Husbandman after much tilling and sowing of corne, and often planting of fruite with great labor and toile, the expected increase is more sauerie and welcome vnto him.

Thou art the cause that the braue souldier and Cauelleir re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring himselfe from bloudie broyles and perillous battles, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyeth more contentedly the heartie welcomes, and the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred embracings of his loyall spouse and wife, and that the quietnesse of a priuate house is farre more swéet vnto those who haue withdrawne themselues, and left the hurliburltes of the Courtes, and the endlesse sutes, and troublesome busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of such as be in law.

Thou art the cause that many giuen to gad abroade, do willingly stay at home, that all things are well and orderly gouerned, that the heart and minde is better cheared, that euill suspitions are expelled and buried, that angry brawlings are detested, that charges and expenses are diminished, and the great excesse of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell not so much vsed, wherein we are commonly so curious, that otherwise (being naturally great sauers) onely therein are we great wasters: all which abuses are auoided by the prouident Wiues discréete and wise carriage of her selfe.</p>

with skill and experience to performe, with capacitie to comprehend with wisedome to vnderstand, with strength to execute, with sollicitude to prosecute, with patience to suffer, with meanes to sustaine, and aboue all, with a great courage to accomplish and bring to an end any enterprize: yet for all this, he is contented to be aduised sometimes by his wife, (though a weake woman) so dearely doth he loue her, for in marriage, loue indefferent serueth not, nor loue fained, pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereth not, but right perfect loue indéed knitteth loyall harts in an indissoluble knot of amitie, euerlastingly to endure: and where such loue is, there do the parties looke for vertues, and not for riches, and there as it is a ioyfull begnning amongst them, so is there as blessed a continuance and ende, all things prospering with them, and sorting out happily eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto their liues end.</p>
               <p>Finally, if any defendeth his countrey, he then defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth marriage, if any saueth his father or his mother or his children, he then preserueth Matrimonie: and through Matrimony came it to passe, that <hi>Cimon</hi> of <hi>Athens</hi> was resembled vnto <hi>Milciades, Alexander</hi> to <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> the great, to <hi>Scipio</hi> his father: and that the one <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius,</hi> after the immitation of the other offered, his life for the good of his countrey.</p>

What is more honourable and praise worthie then this, that Christ with his mother in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> did not onely with his owne presence make honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but also with miracles did sanctifie the same? What is more iust, then to render that vnto our posteritie, which we of our predecessors haue before receiued? What thing is more inhumane then for man to contemn that as prophane, which the eternall <hi>Iehouah</hi> hath hallowed, and <hi>Nature</hi> her selfe bewtified? Christ our Sauiour commandeth that man shall forsake father and mother, and cleaue vnto his welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued spowse: and what is more holy then loue towards our parents, which God in his commandement hath rewarded with long life, and yet Matrimonie is preferred before the same? What is then more ncessarie then marriage, which containeth in it the felicitie of mans life, the flower of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, the preseruation of Realmes, the glorie of Princes, and that which is most of all, it causeth immortalitie?</p>
               <p>To conclude, where in the e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nd, though it be long, yet at the last, you not onely allow of marriage, but commend wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the persons of two great princely Potentates (althogh you might haue done it in many others beside).
