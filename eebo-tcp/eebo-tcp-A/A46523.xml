         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have received undoubted Advice, That a great and ſudden Invaſion from <hi>Holland,</hi> with an Armed Force of Foreigners and Strangers, will ſpeedily be made in a Hoſtile manner upon this Our Kingdom; And although ſome falſe Pretences relating to Liberty, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and Religion, contrived or worded with Art and Subtilty, may be given out (as ſhall be thought uſeful upon ſuch an Attempt) it is manifeſt however, (conſidering the great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations that are making) that no leſs Matter by this Invaſion is propoſed and purpoſed, then an Abſolute Conqueſt of theſe Our Kingdoms, and the utter Subduing and Subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vs and all Our People, to a Foreign Power, which is promoted (as We underſtand, although it may ſeem almoſt Incredible) by ſome of Our Subjects, being Perſons of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reſtleſs Spirits, implacable Malice, and deſperate Deſigns, who having no Senſe of former Inteſtine Diſtractions, the Memory and Miſery whereof ſhould Endear and put a Value upon that Peace and Happineſs which hath long been enjoyed; nor being moved by Our reiterated Acts of Grace and Mercy, wherein We have ſtudied and delighted to abound towards all Our Subjects, and even towards thoſe who were once Our avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and open Enemies, do again endeavour to Imbroil this Kingdom in Bloud and Ruine, to gratifie their own Ambition and Malice, propoſing to themſelves a Prey and Booty in ſuch a publick Confuſion.</p>
            <p>We cannot omit to make it known, That although We had Notice ſometime ſince, that a Foreign Force was preparing againſt Vs, yet We have always declined any Foreign Succors, but rather have choſen (next under God) to relie upon the true and Ancient Courage, Faith and Allegiance of Our own People, with whom We have often ventured Our Life for the Honour of this Nation, and in whoſe Defence againſt all Enemies, We are firmly reſolved to live and die: And therefore We ſolemnly Conjure Our Subjects to lay aſide all manner of Animoſities, Iealouſies and Prejudices, and heartily and chearfully to Vnite together in the Defence of Vs and their Native Countrey, which thing alone will (under God) defeat and fruſtrate the principal Hope and Deſign of Our Enemies, who expect to find Our People Divided, and by publiſhing perhaps ſome plauſible Reaſons of their coming hither, as the ſpecious, though falſe Pretences of maintaining the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, or Aſſerting the Liberties and Properties of Our People, do hope thereby to Conquer this Great and Renowed Kingdom: But albeit the Deſign hath been carried on with all imaginable Secrecy and Endeavours to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize and deceive Vs, VVe have not been wanting on Our Part, to make ſuch Proviſion as did become Vs, and by Gods Bleſſing VVe make no doubt of being found in ſo good a Poſture, that Our Enemies may have cauſe to repent ſuch their raſh and unjuſt Attempt.</p>
            <p>We did intend (as We lately Declared) to have met Our Parliament in <hi>November</hi> next, and the VVrits are iſſued forth accordingly, propoſing to Our ſelves, amongſt other things, that VVe might be able to quiet the Minds of all Our People in matters of Religion, purſuant to the ſeveral Declarations VVe have publiſhed to that effect, but in regard of this ſtrange and unreaſonable Attempt, from Our Neighhouring Countrey (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manner of Provocation) deſigned to divert Our ſaid Gracious Purpoſes, VVe find it neceſſary to recall Our ſaid VVrits, which VVe do hereby recall accordingly, Commanding and Requiring Our Loving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to take Notice thereof, and to ſurceaſe all further Proceedings thereon; And foraſmuch as the approaching Danger which now is at hand, will require a great and vigorous Defence, VVe do hereby ſtrictly Charge and Command All Our Loving Subjects both by Sea and Land (whoſe ready Concurrence, Valour and Courage as true <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> We no way doubt in ſo juſt a Cauſe) to be prepared to defend their Countrey; And We do hereby Command and Require all Lords Lieutenants, and Deputy Lieutenants to Vſe their beſt and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Endeavours to Reſiſt, Repel and Suppreſs Our Enemies, who come with ſuch Confidence and great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to Invade and Conquer theſe Our Kingdoms. And laſtly, We do moſt expreſly and ſtrictly Enjoyn and Prohibit all and every Our Subjects, of what Degree or Condition ſoever, from giving any manner of Aid, Aſſiſtance, Countenance or Succour, or from having or holding any Correſpondence with theſe Our Enemies, or any of their Complices, upon pain of High Treaſon, and being proſecuted and proceeded againſt with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Severity.</p>
