            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THough nothing be more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral than that all, who deny the</hi> Certainty <hi>of the</hi> Rule of Faith, <hi>should deny also the</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty <hi>of</hi> Faith <hi>it self, since the Certainty of this later depends on the Certainty of the former; and, it is impossible the</hi> Conclusion <hi>should be held</hi> Certain, <hi>unless the</hi> Premisses <hi>be held so too, yet, the conceit which the Generality of those who call themselv's</hi> Faithful <hi>or</hi> Christian, <hi>have of</hi> their Faith, <hi>and, consequently, the nature of</hi> that kind <hi>of Assent, is such, that nothing can sound more horridly
<pb facs="tcp:59230:3"/>
and blasphemously to their ears, than bluntly and without disguise to say,</hi> That all their Faith may possibly be a Ly for any thing any man living absolutely knows. <hi>For, a certain goodness of Rational Nature, has fixt this apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in them, that, since the World is made for the</hi> Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>it is unsuitable to the</hi> Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>and</hi> Goodness <hi>of Providence, which has furnisht us with means of</hi> Certainty <hi>for our</hi> inferiour <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, that the Principles on which</hi> Eternity <hi>depends, should fall short of that</hi> Certainty, <hi>and, consequently, of</hi> strength <hi>and</hi> efficacy <hi>to move &amp; carry us on to a steady pursuit of that</hi> greatest, <hi>and, in comparison,</hi> onely <hi>Interest. Notwithstanding, so unresistible is the force of this evident truth, that, whoever has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted the</hi> Catholick Church, <hi>and
<pb facs="tcp:59230:3"/>
her Rule of Faith,</hi> Tradition, <hi>can have no absolute</hi> Certainty <hi>of</hi> Faith; <hi>that is, indeed</hi> no true Faith <hi>(for that truly is</hi> Faith <hi>which the</hi> Generality <hi>of those who use the Word mean by it) that the more intelligent amongst them, conscious of the manifest weakness of their</hi> Grounds, <hi>are necessitated, in their</hi> Controversies, <hi>when they should</hi> defend <hi>their Faith, in plain terms to</hi> disgrace <hi>and</hi> betray <hi>it; chusing rather candidly to confess it to be all a</hi> possible Falshood, <hi>than to undertake that impossible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance to maintain that it is an</hi> Absolute Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I cannot resemble this</hi> Natural Conceit <hi>of the</hi> perfect Certainty of Faith, <hi>inbred as it were in the</hi> Generality <hi>of those who have had even a glimmering of</hi> Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>to any thing so well as to the

apprehension, the former World had of a</hi> Godhead. <hi>For, as</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Instinct <hi>forc't those, who had not light to know the True God, to affix the Notion of a Deity to some false one, as some eminent Heroe, the Sun, Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Fire; nay, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so ridiculous but they would make a God of it, rather than forgoe the tenet of a Soveraign Power so deeply rooted in them by Nature; so, our modern Misbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, rather than they will relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish their Opinion, that</hi> Faith <hi>and the means to know the way to Heaven is</hi> absolutely-Certain, <hi>springing naturally from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit they have that God has a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence for the Salvation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, chuse to misplace the notion of the</hi> Certain means to know God's will, <hi>or Rule of Faith, in
<pb facs="tcp:59230:4"/>
the most unlikely things imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; as, in a ridiculous whimsy of Fancy little better than a</hi> Dream, <hi>nay sometimes in a dream it self, or in the motion of some</hi> hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondriacal vapour, <hi>as do the</hi> Fanaticks; <hi>others, in other things seemingly wiser; as, in their</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions <hi>of some men they esteem</hi> Good <hi>and</hi> Learned; <hi>in meerly</hi> their being educated <hi>thus by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents who confess they have</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquish'd <hi>what themselves had been educated to; in</hi> Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>of words by Grammatical skill which were writ long ago, and in dogmatical points, where</hi> every word <hi>is capable of</hi> equivocalness; <hi>nay (which is indeed as mad as the most</hi> extatick <hi>of them all) to affirm that such words are so</hi> plain <hi>to every Reader that</hi> none <hi>can miss the right sense of them:
<pb facs="tcp:59230:5"/>
All which, though plainly confuted by this Principle which Nature teaches the rudest, that,</hi> That can never be a way which many follow to their power and yet the greater part are misled, <hi>joyn'd to their plain Experience that many followers of these wayes exceedingly differ; yet, so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent is the force of</hi> the other Truth, <hi>that they will wink at this</hi> later <hi>to embrace</hi> that; <hi>inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that none of those (I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> Seekers, <hi>by what name soever they are call'd, as not being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to Faith) but, were they ask'd whether they be not</hi> as Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>of their</hi> Faith <hi>as that</hi> they live, <hi>would readily and heartily answer</hi> affirmatively; <hi>I mean those of every sort who follow meerly the</hi> Guidance <hi>of uncorrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this affair.</hi>

               <hi>What I am on this occasion chiefly to reflect on, is</hi> my own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation; <hi>which is, the</hi> boldness <hi>of owning and publishing the</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of Christian Faith, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the height, to assert it's</hi> Absolute Firmness <hi>and</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty <hi>in the best manner God shall enable me: and his Providence seems to</hi> require <hi>it of me at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; In regard 'tis expected I should reply to Mr.</hi> Tillotson<hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Answer to</hi> Sure Footing; <hi>whose</hi> first Principle <hi>in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply seems to be this, that, what he deems the</hi> Rule of Christian Faith, <hi>and, consequently, that</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59230:9"/>
Faith it self <hi>is</hi> possible to be False; <hi>for, by virtue of</hi> this <hi>Position, which he</hi> defends <hi>p. 118, and in diverse other places</hi> implies <hi>and</hi> builds on, <hi>he more oppugns my discourse than by</hi> any other Thesis <hi>whatever. The contrary to which if I evince, then the Protestants own confession, that they have</hi> no Absolutely-Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ground <hi>or</hi> Rule of Faith, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes them without more ado, and concludes them to have relinquish'd its onely right, because its onely truly certain Rule,</hi> TRADITION.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet, were it not my</hi> chief <hi>design to</hi> establish <hi>the</hi> Absolute Truth <hi>of Christian Faith in it self, by</hi> all <hi>the Arguments I can imagin, and not meerly to</hi> confute <hi>Protestant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertists, I needed not take the pains thus to</hi> multiply <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or even alledg so much as</hi> one. <hi>For, since, whatever they pretend
<pb facs="tcp:59230:9"/>
seemingly</hi> to Antiquity <hi>or</hi> Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Fathers <hi>by their voluminous quotations, yet they will finally and heartily stand to nothing in contests about Faith, as</hi> Conclusive, <hi>but</hi> their own Interpretations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>Which being so</hi> weak <hi>a Ground that every dayes</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>shows it's</hi> Failings; <hi>an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Probability is abundantly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to overthrow their Discourses, whose very</hi> Principle <hi>is not onely</hi> Improbable, <hi>but evidently a</hi> False <hi>one; Whence, the</hi> meanest <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick writer cannot fail to have the advantage over their</hi> Best <hi>in a Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential man's Esteem; because he cannot possibly miss of a</hi> Medium <hi>more probable than is their</hi> main Ground. <hi>I declare then that my</hi> Chief End <hi>in this Treatise is to</hi> set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Christian <hi>Faith, or to demonstrate that it must be</hi> truly <hi>or</hi> Absolutely
<pb facs="tcp:59230:10"/>
Certain; <hi>and that my applying it now and then to my Opposers, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Secundary Intention, and meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Occasional.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ere I fall close to my Proofs, that</hi> Faith cannot possibly be False, <hi>to avoid Equivocation in the words, I declare that by the word</hi> [Faith] <hi>I am not sollicitous whether be meant our</hi> Act of Faith <hi>or the</hi> Points of Faith, <hi>that is, the</hi> Object of that Act; <hi>but judg that distinction wholly Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in this present discourse; and, the reason is, because I cannot</hi> affirm <hi>a Point</hi> True <hi>or</hi> False, <hi>but as it stands under Motives</hi> able <hi>to make me</hi> judge, assent <hi>or</hi> beleeve <hi>'tis such or such; which Motives, if they be such as are able to</hi> convince <hi>that the Point</hi> cannot but be so, <hi>then my Iudgment or Assent tothose Points,</hi> thusconcluded, <hi>that is my</hi> Act <hi>of Faith</hi> cannot but be True; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:59230:10"/>
it depends</hi> intirely <hi>on Grounds</hi> Impossible to be False, <hi>viz. those Motives; But, if those Motives are</hi> not <hi>of such a nature as is</hi> absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conclusive <hi>the thing</hi> is, <hi>then both the Thing, Object, Point, or Proposition of Faith, as being</hi> onely <hi>Knowable by virtue of</hi> them, <hi>may be otherwise, and also my</hi> Act <hi>of Faith or</hi> Belief <hi>of those Points may be a wrong or erroneous Iudgment; that is, both of them</hi> may be False. <hi>To ask then</hi> if Faith can possibly be False, <hi>is to ask whether the Motives laid by God's Providence for</hi> Mankind <hi>or his</hi> Church <hi>to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Christian</hi> Faith, <hi>must be</hi> such <hi>as of their own nature</hi> cannot fail to conclude <hi>those points</hi> True; <hi>and, to affirm that</hi> Faith is not possible to be False, <hi>is equivalently to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert that</hi> those Motives <hi>or the</hi> Rule of Faith, <hi>must be thus</hi> absolutely
<pb facs="tcp:59230:11"/>
Conclusive, <hi>Firm, and Immovable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence is seen, that I concern not my self in this discourse with how</hi> perfectly <hi>or</hi> imperfectly <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse persons</hi> penetrate <hi>those mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; or how they satisfy or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfy</hi> some particular Persons; <hi>since, I onely speak of the</hi> Nature <hi>of those</hi> Motives <hi>in themselves, and as laid in Second Causes by Gods Providence to light</hi> Mankind <hi>in their way to</hi> Faith: <hi>to which the</hi> dimness <hi>of eye-sight,</hi> neglect <hi>to look at all, or looking the</hi> wrong <hi>way, even in many particular men, is</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecal <hi>and</hi> Contingent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly, to avoid Mistake and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, I declare, that there being</hi> two <hi>sorts of Questions,</hi> one <hi>concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the</hi> Existence <hi>of a thing, call'd</hi> An est, <hi>viz. whether there be any Certainly-Conclusive Rule of Faith, or no; and the</hi> other <hi>about</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59230:11"/>
what is <hi>the Certain or truely-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive Rule of Faith, call'd</hi> Quid est; <hi>I am not</hi> now <hi>discoursing about the</hi> later <hi>(that was the work of SURE FOOTING) but the</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>onely. Indeed, in my first di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse</hi> there <hi>I endeavour'd to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince this</hi> Truth <hi>from</hi> par. 1. <hi>to</hi> par 17. <hi>by</hi> diverse <hi>Arguments; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Mr.</hi> T. <hi>waves the speaking to those</hi> Premises <hi>as they tend to</hi> infer <hi>my Conclusion, and onely discourses a little (Mistakingly) against the</hi> Conclusions <hi>themselves, therefore, being resolv'd to</hi> write <hi>a Treatise to establish Christian Faith, I thought fit to</hi> apply <hi>it to his proceedure there; that so I may both more forcibly invite him to that</hi> necessary <hi>though</hi> neglected <hi>Duty, and, withall that by settling the</hi> Existence <hi>&amp;</hi> Nature <hi>of</hi> Faith <hi>and it's</hi> Rule <hi>first, I may clear the way methodically to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scover</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59230:12"/>
what, <hi>and</hi> onely what, <hi>can be the</hi> right Rule of Faith. <hi>And, possibly in my</hi> next <hi>Treatise if Mr.</hi> T. <hi>and Mr. St. think fit to continue on this discourse forwards by answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> this, <hi>they may, by</hi> denying <hi>that in true speech the Points of Faith are</hi> Truths, <hi>or Faith is</hi> True, <hi>oblige me to begin yet higher, and make use of such</hi> Mediums <hi>as are more direct and immediately fit to confute</hi> Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The understanding Reader will easily pardon the</hi> Speculativeness <hi>of this Treatise in great part of it: if he reflects that discourses built on</hi> Intrinsecal Mediums <hi>and manag'd in the way of</hi> Severe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>do</hi> naturally, <hi>nay must</hi> neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily, <hi>bear up to the</hi> First Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; <hi>yet, by the</hi> Harmony <hi>and</hi> Connexion <hi>of Truths with one
<pb facs="tcp:59230:12"/>
another, there will be found al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so</hi> very many <hi>Proofs fairly</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible <hi>by the</hi> middle <hi>sort of Prudential men; especially in those Arguments which are drawn from</hi> Practice; <hi>and, if I flatter not my self, some Proofs, and those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing ones too, suitable to every Capacity. This comfort my Readers may expect to reap by this Procedure that it must forcibly shorten Disputes, and bring Controversies after a while to a period, unless our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries be still obstinately bent to play the</hi> Drolls <hi>instead of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly and pertinently</hi> disputing. <hi>For, hardly can</hi> Errour <hi>hide her</hi> deformity, <hi>when she is exposed</hi> naked <hi>to the view of</hi> Rational nature <hi>in the</hi> noon-day-light <hi>of</hi> FIRST-PRINCIPLES.</p>

            <p>§ 1. I Lay for the <hi>Basis</hi> of my present Discourse these two Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Christians are oblig'd to hold firmly, profess, and stand to it, even with</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Postulata.</note> 
               <hi>the loss of their Lives, that Points of Faith are</hi> TRUTHS.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>None can be thus oblig'd to hold, profess, and maintain that to be</hi> TRUTH <hi>which they know not to be so.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The later of these is as certain, as that God, the Imposer of this Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is <hi>Good:</hi> For how unworthy his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit Goodness were it, to will that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59230:14"/>
               <hi>rational Nature</hi> or <hi>Mankind</hi> should act irrationally by <hi>holding firmly</hi> what it has <hi>no firm Grounds</hi> to hold; that is, what it <hi>knows not</hi> to be so? Or to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice its very <hi>Being</hi> to testifie the truth of those Points, concerning which, if it work according to right reason, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture God has given it, and deviate not from that by a weak credulity, it can never be perfectly satisfy'd that they are indeed Truths; which it can never be, if, notwithstanding all it knows, they yet may possibly be Falshoods. No man in true morality ought to say what he <hi>knows not,</hi> much less so asseverantly, as to seal it with his blood.</p>
            <p>As for the former Proposition, which I account most fundamental to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing Discourse, I am to declare that by <hi>Holding,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>a thing to be a Truth,</hi> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the holding that the thing <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, in reality,</hi> or <hi>indeed, is so as I judge.</hi> Whence to this Holding a Thing to be Truth, 'tis not enough that a man hold <hi>it is so to the best of his judgment;</hi> but 'tis requir'd moreover, that he hold he is not deceiv'd in making such a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and this, because he holds his Thought <hi>conformable to the Thing.</hi> For,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59230:14"/>
this settles Verity or Truth on its proper and firm Foundation, <hi>the thing;</hi> and not on the unstable motions of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as does the other. My first and chief <hi>Postulatum</hi> thus understood, I esteem to be self-evident to all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with Christianity taken in its largest sense, as I declar'd in my Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; setting aside that sort of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culaters; I mean those of our modern Adversaries, against whom I dispute at present; and of whom the Question is now agitated, whether they are indeed to be held right Christians or no. And I conceive that he who should deny it, must be bound to put the contradictory Position; and to affirm, that <hi>Christians are not bound firmly to hold, profess, and maintain with the loss of their lives the</hi> TRUTH <hi>of their Faith,</hi> but its <hi>Likelihood</hi> onely.</p>
            <p>He that affirms this, if he would be held a Christian, is to be confuted by the contrary sentiment of the generality of Christians, from whom he dissents in so Fundamental a Point as is the rightly understanding the nature of <hi>Faith,</hi> which they <hi>profess,</hi> and which it so highly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them to <hi>know;</hi> that is, indeed, in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59230:15"/>
rightly understanding the meaning of the word <hi>Faith.</hi> If he be no Christian, yet hold the Godhead, 'tis to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated partly from the <hi>proper effects</hi> of Faith, and the nature of the great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, both intellectual and moral, which 'tis ordain'd to master: partly out of the nature of God and his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes, obliging him to lay means pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to an intended end; or to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish every thing according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern that depends on it, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern in our case is the highest imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to wit, <hi>the Salvation of Mankind,</hi> the End of creating those very Entities on which the Certitude of Science is built. Or, lastly, if he be an Atheist, the Deity and it's Attributes are first to be demonstrated: as also what is Man's <hi>summum bonum,</hi> and the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Disposition to it; and then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Certitude of <hi>Faith,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of it's <hi>Rule</hi> are to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.</p>
            <p>Supposing then my later <hi>Postulatum</hi> to be evident to all that know there is a wise and good Governour of the world, and who understand the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Principles of Morality; and my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59230:15"/>
former <hi>Postulatum</hi> to be clear and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable matter of Fact to those who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with Christianity; and therefore to have unavoidable force upon all that would be held Professors thereof, I shall be bold to proceed upon them.</p>
            <p>And, first, <hi>Logick,</hi> whose proper of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice 'tis to look into the nature and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Soul as <hi>Rational;</hi> and as it were, to anatomize her Thoughts, takes up the discourse, and proceeds thus.</p>
            <p>§ 2. <hi>Truths</hi> are found in <hi>Propositions;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated from the nature of <hi>Evidence.</hi>
               </note> a Proposition consists of two Notions called <hi>Subject,</hi> and <hi>Predicate,</hi> and a third, whose office 'tis to connect them; whence to <hi>know</hi> a thing to be Truth or true, is to <hi>see</hi> the <hi>Conn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xion</hi> between the two Notions spoken of, or to see that the third truly connects them. Now there are but two wayes imaginable (ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting from Experience) how this may be <hi>seen:</hi> Either by seeing immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately that those two Notions are the same with one another out of the very Notions themselves; or else by seeing that they are <hi>each</hi> of them the same with a <hi>Third;</hi> whence follows, that, unless that Third Notion can fail to be the same with it self, those two Notions
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59230:16"/>
which are the same with it, cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fail to be the same with one another. The former is called <hi>Self-Evidence;</hi> this later, <hi>Evidence by deduction:</hi> Both are built immediately upon this grand Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that, <hi>The same is the same with it self;</hi> wherefore, unless it be seen: that the Truth of that most Self-Evident Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>om is engag'd in their Patronage, they cannot be even known to be <hi>True;</hi> and, if it be <hi>seen</hi> that it is thus engag'd, they must needs be known <hi>impossible to be false;</hi> since 'tis most manifestly impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that First Principles should be false, or that <hi>the same should not be the same with it self.</hi> Wherefore, either Points of Faith need not be known to be <hi>Truths,</hi> or else they must (by Reflecte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s at least) be known <hi>impossible to he false.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. The same is evinc't from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">From the nature of the <hi>Subject</hi> in Faith-Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> of the <hi>Subject</hi> in those Propositions which affirm the Truth of any point of Faith: For, if we look narrowly, we shall find that the Subject in those is, either formally, or in effect, a <hi>Proposition</hi> it self; as when we say, <hi>This Proposition [Christ is really in the Sacrament] is true; [That God is one and three] is true,</hi> &amp;c. Where the Subjects are manifestly these;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59230:16"/>
               <hi>Christ is really in the Sacrament; God is one and three,</hi> or, <hi>a Trinity is.</hi> A Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then being a Speech apt to express <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falshood,</hi> nay necessarily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to do the one, (excepting those which speak of a future Contingent) it follows, that who ever is bound in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to affirm that the Proposition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the point of Faith is <hi>True,</hi> is bound likewise to affirm 'tis <hi>impossible to be false,</hi> if taken in the same sense he means it; that is, indeed, if taken for the same Proposition, since 'tis impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Truth</hi> should be <hi>Falshood.</hi> Either then Christ's followers are not oblig'd to affirm the Points they profess are <hi>true,</hi> which thwarts the Sentiments of the Christian part of mankind; or else, they must necessarily be oblig'd, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to affirm them <hi>impossible to be false.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. The same is concluded from the <note place="margin">From the nature of the <hi>Copula</hi>
               </note> nature of the <hi>Copula, [is]</hi> whose office being to connect or identifie the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Subject and Predicate, that is, to express that what is meant by those two notions is to be found in the same <hi>Thing,</hi> or that they have one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon stock of Being, its proper signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is <hi>Being</hi> or <hi>Existence;</hi> not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59230:17"/>
as if it meant that either of the Terms exists in Things; but compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively or conditionally as it were, that that Being which belongs to one of the Terms, is the same Being with that which belongs to the other; or that by the same Being whereby one of the Terms <hi>is,</hi> the other <hi>is</hi> also. Now then, this kind of Expression or Significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being such as has no latitude between it and its utmost Opposit or Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, <hi>[is not]</hi> it being the most uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded notion that is, and not capable to be mingled with any alloy or partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of its Opposit, as it happens in <hi>Contraries:</hi> it follows that who holds the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Proposition, or, which is all one, the Identification of the two Terms exprest by the <hi>Copula [is]</hi> must hold it <hi>absolutely,</hi> and the Opposite to be <hi>impossible to be false;</hi> nothing being more impossible than that <hi>is</hi> and <hi>is not</hi> should both be true at once; or that the same thing should be the same and not the same in the same respect, that is, should <hi>be true,</hi> and <hi>not be true:</hi> And hence it is, that though distinctions use to fall upon the Equivocalness of the two <hi>Terms,</hi> yet no man that knows what Logick
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59230:17"/>
meant, ever distinguisht the meer <hi>Copula,</hi> its simplest notion not admitting any possible division.</p>
            <p>§ 5. Our Argument from the <hi>Copula</hi>

                  </hi> in most of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</note> is particularly strengthen'd from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Predicate</hi> in the Propositions we speak of; I mean in such Speeches as affirm such and such Points of Faith to be <hi>True.</hi> For <hi>True</hi> means <hi>Existent,</hi> in Propositions which express onely the <hi>An est</hi> of a thing, as most Points of Faith do; which speak abstractedly, and tell notwherein the nature of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it speaks of consists, or the <hi>Quid est.</hi> So that most of the Propositions Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are bound to profess, are fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest thus; <hi>A Trinity is Existent,</hi> a <hi>Christ God-and-man is Existent,</hi> &amp;c. and the like may be said of those Points which belong to a Thing or Action <hi>past;</hi> as, <hi>Creation was, Christs Crucifying was,</hi> &amp;c. For, <hi>Existent</hi> is the Predicate in these too, onely affixt to another difference of time; and 'tis equally impossible such Subjects should <hi>neither have been</hi> nor <hi>not have been,</hi> or <hi>have been</hi> and <hi>have not been</hi> at once, as it is that a thing should neither <hi>be</hi> nor <hi>not be</hi> at present, or both <hi>be</hi> and <hi>not be</hi> at present. Regarding
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59230:18"/>
then stedfastly the nature of our Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, <hi>[Existent;]</hi> we shall find that it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses the utmost Actuality of a Thing; and, as taken in the posture it bears in those Propositions, that Actuality <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis'd;</hi> that is, the utmost Actuality in its most actual state; that is, as absolutely excluding all manner or least degree of Potentiality, and confequently all Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of being otherwise; which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically destroy'd when all Potentiality is taken away. This Discourse holding, which in right to Truth I shall not fear to affirm (unconcern'd in the drollery of any Opposer) to be more than Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matically <hi>demonstrative,</hi> (as shall be shown more particularly hereafter) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows inevitably, that who so is bound to profess a <hi>Trinity, Incarnation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is</hi> or <hi>was Existent,</hi> is also bound to profess that 'tis <hi>impossible they should be not-Existent;</hi> or which is all one, that 'tis impossible these points of Faith should be false.</p>

The same appears out of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">From the nature of <hi>Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd to the Predicate.</note> of <hi>distinction</hi> or <hi>division</hi> apply'd to our Predicate <hi>Existent,</hi> as found in these Propositions: For, could that Predicate bear a pertinent distinction, expressing this and the other respect, or <hi>thus</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59230:18"/>
               <hi>thus,</hi> it might possibly <hi>be</hi> according to one of those respects, or thus <hi>consider'd,</hi> and <hi>not be</hi> according to another, that is, <hi>another way consider'd:</hi> But this evasion is here impossible; for, either those di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing Notions must be more Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential or antecedent to the Notion of <hi>Existent,</hi> and then they neither reach Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent, nor supervene to it as its Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations or Actuations, which Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to do; nor can any Notion be more <hi>Actual</hi> or <hi>Determinative</hi> in the line of <hi>Substance</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> than <hi>Existent</hi> is; and, so, fit to distinguish it in that line; nor, lastly, can any determination in the line of Accidents serve the turn; for, these suppose Existence already put, and so the whole Truth of the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion entire and compleat antecedently to them: 'Tis impossible therefore that what is thus affirm'd to be <hi>True,</hi> should in <hi>any regard</hi> be affirm'd <hi>possible to be false;</hi> the impossibility of distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Predicate pertinently, excluding here all possibility of divers respects. <note place="margin">From the impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Faith-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</note>
            </p>
            <p>§ 7. The same is demonstrated from the impossibility of distinguishing the Subjects of those Faith-Propositions; for those Subjects being Propositions
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59230:19"/>
themselves, (as was shown § 3.) and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for <hi>Truths,</hi> as is suppos'd, they are incapable of Distinction, as shall be particularly shown hereafter, (Evict. 3. § 5.) Besides those Subjects being Points of Faith, and, so, standing in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract, that is, not descending to subsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming respects, even in that regard too they are freed from all pertinent distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishableness.</p>
            <p>§ 8. The same is demonstrated from the nature of <hi>Truth,</hi> which consists in <note place="margin">From the nature of <hi>Truth,</hi> consisting in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible.</note> an Indivisible: Whence there is nothing of <hi>Truth</hi> had, how great soever the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived approaches towards it be, till all <hi>may-not-bees,</hi> or Potentiality to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, be utterly excluded by the Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of <hi>Is</hi> or Existence: which put or discover'd, the Light of <hi>Truth</hi> breaks forth, and the dim twilights of <hi>may-not-bees</hi> vanish and disappear.</p>
            <p>§ 9. The same is demonstrated out of <note place="margin">From the nature of <hi>Connexion</hi>
               </note> the nature of <hi>Connexion</hi> found in the aforesaid Propositions. For, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent their Truth consists in the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those Notions which make the Subject and Predicate. Whoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sees not the Connexion between those Notions in the Principle of Faith,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59230:19"/>
sees not the truth of any of those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions; that is, those Propositions are not to such a man <hi>True.</hi> Wherefore, Connexion excluding formally Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion, so that 'tis clearly impossible they should be found together in the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same Subjects, and the falshood of such Propositions consisting in the Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nectedness of their Terms, it follows that he who is oblig'd to profess those Faith-Propositions <hi>True,</hi> must see the Connexion between their <hi>Terms,</hi> and consequently that they <hi>cannot possibly</hi> be inconnected or <hi>false.</hi> Again, since all approaches or vicinity to Connexion, by how near degrees soever they are made, are <hi>not</hi> Connexion, it follows that all Connexion consists in an Indivisible, and can admit no Latitude for <hi>a Possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be otherwise,</hi> to be grounded on. Lastly, all Connexion being necessarily Immediate, or seen by virtue of Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diateness, and to see Immediate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion being the Producer of <hi>Certain Knowledg,</hi> or of Assurance the Thing <hi>cannot but be so;</hi> it follows, that to see the Truth of such Propositions, or, which is all one, the Immediate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of their Terms, is to see they
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59230:20"/>
               <hi>cannot but be so,</hi> or that they are absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly void of all <hi>Possibility of Falshood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 10. By this time we are brought <note place="margin">From the nature of <hi>Opinion.</hi>
               </note> orderly to look into the nature of <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Which word I take not here in a large sense for any kind of Assent, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever produc't; but for an Assent or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hesion to a Tenet without sufficient Grounds to evince the Thing <hi>is so</hi> as the Opiner judges; as it is taken in that Proverb, <hi>Turpe est opinari.</hi> Now, 'tis most evident, that there would be sufficient Grounds to convince, in case, the Term or Point were seen to be deduc't by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate steps, or a Train of immediate Connexions to that very Conclusion. 'Tis manifest then, that 'tis therefore <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> and blame-worthy, because its Grounds, as they are laid in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the Assenter, want or fall short of this immediate Connexion; So that <hi>Opinion</hi> is a judgment upon <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote</hi> or unimmediate Considerations. By which means it comes to pass, that the most necessary verity of that Grand Principle, <hi>[The same is the same with it self]</hi> upon which all Certainty both of first Principles and of <hi>Deduction</hi> is built, and whose perfect Self-Evidence and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59230:20"/>
Interessedness in whatever belongs to right discourse, seem to make the very Light of Reason consist originally in It, is not engag'd in the <hi>Opiners</hi> discourse; whence, wanting Immediateness, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes unconnected, incoherent, weak, and slack, or rather indeed <hi>null.</hi> No wonder then if all Opinion, how near soever it approaches seemingly to Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Connexion, and how strongly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be supported by an experienc'd seldomness of such Effects, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd unaptness and fewness of Causes fit to produce them, yet it admits <hi>Possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of being otherwise;</hi> in regard it fails in its very Root and <hi>Basis,</hi> by not relying on the main Principle and Foundation of all steadiness in humane Discourse, and which is of so necessary a Truth, that 'tis impossible to falter or give way, to uphold and exempt it from a liable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to disconnexion of those Notions which it pretended, and ought to Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify; that is, from a liableness to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p>§ 11. From this declaration of the nature of <hi>Opinion,</hi> it is render'd manifest out of what Fountain-head all Rational Assents flow; namely, from seeing the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59230:21"/>
Immediate Connexion of one Term with another; or, which is all one, that this Principle <hi>[The same is the same with it self]</hi> stands engag'd for their verity: Also, that the Light of Reason consists <hi>fundamentally</hi> in this; and <hi>formally</hi> in deriving the <hi>perfect Visibleness</hi> of this to make other Propositions also <hi>visible</hi> to the Eye of our Understanding. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that Assents not springing from this Light of Reason, must be, as such, <hi>Irrational;</hi> and arise necessarily from the <hi>Will,</hi> taken as not following the Light of Understanding, but as prompted and put forward by some passion, <hi>viz.</hi> some ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational desire or inclination the thing should be so, which prest and precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the understanding into Assent before due motives forc't it. As likewise, that since none can be bound <hi>constantly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess</hi> what he cannot <hi>steadily see</hi> to be true, a Christian who is thus bound to <hi>profess</hi> his <hi>Faith True,</hi> must <hi>see</hi> that the First Principle now spoken of, which gives all <hi>Steadiness</hi> to our Intellectual Sight, is interessed in the patronage of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position he assents to: Whence, true Faith, by reason of its Immoveable Grounds, can bear an asserting the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59230:21"/>
absolute Impossibility of its being False; whereas, who ever affirms <hi>Faith may possibly be false,</hi> makes it built upon remote <hi>mediums,</hi> that is, such as are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not immediate; or (which is all one) not seen to be immediate to the two Terms of the Proposition assented to; and so, they become destitute of the Invincible strength of that first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which establishes all deduc't Truths, and legitimates all Assents to them. Whence follows inevitably, that he turns all Faith into Opinion; makes Faith absurd, preternatural and irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal; importing that 'tis a thing which men <hi>must</hi> assent to or say interior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>'tis so,</hi> and yet see no <hi>solid</hi> Grounds <hi>why it must be so;</hi> profess stoutly <hi>'tis true,</hi> and that they are <hi>sure</hi> of it; and yet, if they will speak truly, profess with all, that <hi>it may be false,</hi> and that the whole world may be mistaken in it; and lastly, he leaves all Christs Doctrine Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensible, and utterly unmaintainable to have, absolutely speaking, either any so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity or steadiness in its Grounds, or one true word in it self.</p>

            <p>§. 1. FRom this not-seeing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the two Terms in <note place="margin">The Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin and Natures of <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence</hi> and <hi>Assent.</hi>
               </note> the Conclusion by a <hi>Medium</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately connected to them both, but by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Glances onely, which have not the power to make one <hi>see Intellectually</hi> the Thing <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>Assent;</hi> joyn'd with this that, notwithstanding, 'tis not seen those Terms are Opposit or <hi>Inconnectible;</hi> the Soul becomes hereupon, as it were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with a kind of Intellectual Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and sees not which way to step for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, without danger of harming hor Cognoscitive or Truth-affecting Nature by <hi>Errour.</hi> Whence, she remains in a kind of Neutral Condition, which we call <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.</hi> But, 'tis to be well noted, that this Suspensive Condition of the Soul, not being a state of Actuality or Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, (much less of utmost Actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as is the seeing, by virtue of that main Principle before-nam'd, that a thing <hi>is)</hi> but of Indetermination, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiality, and Confusedness; its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture admits consequently infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59230:22"/>
according as the Appearances which incline her towards Assent or Dissent are greater or less. Moreover, as in the passing from Indetermination to Determination (for example) in a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a <hi>Terminus</hi> of Rest, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse approaches of that Motions Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity so very near the <hi>Terminus</hi> or End, that their distance is undiscernable to a vulgar eye, and needs exact skill to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish them: So it happens here, that there must necessarily be found divers Inclinations or Approaches towards <hi>Assent,</hi> which have so small a degree of <hi>Suspence</hi> in them, that they are hard to be distinguisht from absolute Assents, but by a learned Reflecter; and the way he takes to distinguish them must be to observe whether the Understanding, acting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flectingly, that is, looking into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of its own Act, finds there that it absolutely yields it self over to judg the thing <hi>is existent</hi> or <hi>true,</hi> or whether it onely judges it <hi>very probable</hi> or <hi>Truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely.</hi> For, any Assent to the <hi>greatest Likelihood</hi> of a thing is as far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Assent to the things <hi>Existence,</hi> as the Notion of <hi>Existent</hi> or <hi>True</hi> is from the Notion of <hi>very likely to be true.</hi> And
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59230:23"/>
if the Assent to the former be not <hi>actually</hi> an Assent to the later, yet tend towards it, as it does; then 'tis <hi>Potential</hi> in respect of it, and so includes some degree of <hi>Suspence;</hi> which defect only can in our present case, hinder the other from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actually <hi>it,</hi> according to our former Discourse. <hi>Assent,</hi> then, to the <hi>meer Likelihood</hi> of a thing, is, or at least im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, <hi>Suspence</hi> of its <hi>Existence</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 2. Another thing which inclines men to confound the Assent to the <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood</hi> of a thing, with the Assent to its <hi>Existence</hi> or <hi>Truth,</hi> is Habituation or <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom.</hi> For, men being us'd to proceed naturally to outward Action upon a very high Probability, without more adoe or examination, they are hence apt to apprehend that a Conceit, which had so little and so undiscernable a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Suspence in it, was a <hi>perfect Assent:</hi> and that, because the Soul quite yielded to the Motive as to <hi>Exterior Action,</hi> therefore it yielded likewise as to <hi>Interior Assent.</hi> Whereas, by reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Nature of this Act in the Soul, and by retriving its Grounds, we come to discover that, however the Soul runs promptly and rationally to Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59230:23"/>
Action upon such a Motive, when she is concern'd to act, even after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration; yet, not so to Interiour As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, if she acts rationally; but, upon reflexion, finding in her self nothing to fix in her the Existence of the thing, or elevate it beyond the possibility of <hi>not-being</hi> or being False, she hangs back from assenting the thing <hi>is,</hi> and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to say interiorly, or acknowledg in her own breast, she may possibly be mistaken, and the thing possibly be <hi>not-Existent,</hi> for ought she sees; which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains her from truly <hi>assenting</hi> that the thing <hi>is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. An Instance will render our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse clearer. 'Tis propos'd then (for example) to our Judging Power, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>America be</hi> or <hi>no?</hi> And we'l sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (to avoid a disputed case) the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Authority has convinc'd the Understanding it once <hi>was,</hi> by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility the several Attesters should either be deceiv'd in a plain Object of Eye-sight, or have a common Motive able to make them conspire to bely their Eyes. But, the Question is, whether it <hi>be now</hi> or <hi>no.</hi> And, the uncouthness and unlikelihood that so vaste a place should
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59230:24"/>
be destroy'd, joyn'd with the Customa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness of acting upon a very great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, makes him who is to act in order to it, (for example, send a ship thither) proceed to his intended outward action fearlesly, and esteem him <hi>mad</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists upon a conceit of so unlikely a failure. For, since all Action is in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, and Particulars are the very Sphear of Contingency, it follows, that we must not act at all, if we expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Demonstrations of the several Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Adjuncts of our outward Action: Whence he deserves justly to be accounted frantick who should desist from Action where there is so high a Probability; for this extravagant cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness were in effect to take away the Motives to any Exteriour Action in the world, and consequently all such Action it self. But now, let two Speculaters or Scholars meet together, who consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not the <hi>Practicableness,</hi> but meerly the <hi>Truth</hi> of things; and aim not to better their Purse by Merchandizing or outward Endeavours, but their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings by rightly-made Judgments or <hi>Assents,</hi> that is, by <hi>Knowledges:</hi> and we shall see their working on the Point
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59230:24"/>
turns upon other hinges. In the other, there was <hi>Necessity of acting,</hi> without which the world could not subsist: but, here's <hi>no necessity of Assenting,</hi> which we suppose onely aim'd at, at present; nor can there be any, unless that Principle or Cause of all Assent <hi>[The same is the same with it self]</hi> comes to exercise its over-powering Virtue upon the Soul. <hi>There,</hi> it was enough that <hi>prudential</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations discover'd a <hi>betterness</hi> to act exteriourly, all things weigh'd; to which needed not a severity of Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples forcing the <hi>Truth</hi> of the thing: but <hi>here,</hi> those Principles, which are the Maxims of Metaphysicks or Supreme Wisdom, are the only things to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted; and the prudential weighing of Particulars avails little or nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the secure establishment of the <hi>Truth</hi> aim'd at. <hi>There,</hi> some harm was likely to ensue, if they acted not <hi>exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourly,</hi> and went not about their work: but, <hi>here,</hi> no harm at all could come by not acting <hi>interiourly;</hi> I mean, by <hi>not-Assenting,</hi> but <hi>Suspending</hi> till the beams of Truth, by the Fountain-light of that First Principle, clear'd their Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: rather on the contrary, a great
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59230:25"/>
harm was certain to ensue upon assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that case, that is, an Injury to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, their true Nature; by <hi>concluding,</hi> without seeing a middle Term connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two Extreams, on which every act of right Reason is built. These Scholars then, or Pursuers of Truth, consult with Speculative, not Practical Principles, to guide their Assents by. They are certain that such <hi>an Effect</hi> (as is the destruction of <hi>America) cannot be without a Cause;</hi> and Experience tells them such Causes seldom or never hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: Yet, knowing that all material things have Contingency annext to their Natures, and not discovering any evident Principle in Nature hindering the vast Oceans on either side <hi>America</hi> to overswell the Continent, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy it; they are forc'd to confess in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriourly <hi>America</hi> may, for any thing they know, <hi>possibly not be;</hi> whence they are forc'd to <hi>suspend,</hi> as to its <hi>Existence,</hi> and only <hi>Assent</hi> to it's extream <hi>Likelihood</hi> of existing.</p>
            <p>§ 4. The use I make of this discourse <note place="margin">The Point evinc't from the natures of <hi>Suspence</hi> and <hi>Assent</hi>
               </note> at present is this: that, though <hi>Likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods</hi> have a great latitude; yet <hi>Assent,</hi> (being the <hi>terminus</hi> of those Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59230:25"/>
towards it, which gradually exceed one another) consists in an Indivisible, as does the notion of <hi>is,</hi> on which (either <hi>seen,</hi> or <hi>deem'd</hi> to be <hi>seen)</hi> 'tis built, and to which it goes parallell. That, all Acts falling short of Assent to the <hi>Existence</hi> of a thing advance no farther than great Assents to it's <hi>Likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi> and fall under the head of <hi>suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Acts;</hi> as to that things Existence, as the Soul will discover upon reflexion: and that, when we mistake one for the other, 'tis for not distinguishing well the great resemblance between assenting as to outward Action, and as to the speculative Truth; as also between as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to the <hi>extream Likelihood</hi> of a thing, and assenting to its <hi>Existence.</hi> That, whensoever we see the <hi>Possibility of a things being False</hi> or <hi>not-Existent</hi> (which in our case is all one) we cannot have an Assent to it's <hi>Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> but to the <hi>likelihood</hi> of it only, and <hi>suspend</hi> as to its Existence or <hi>actual being:</hi> and that, therefore, they who acknowledg that, notwithstanding all the Means used and all the Grounds it has, Faith may <hi>possibly be false</hi> to us, cannot be held to <hi>assent</hi> to the <hi>Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:59230:26"/>
or <hi>Truth</hi> of those points; but to <hi>suspend</hi> concerning their <hi>truth,</hi> and to <hi>assent</hi> only to their <hi>likelihood to be true,</hi> Which, whether it be a sufficient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition to denominate such persons <hi>Christians,</hi> will easily and best be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by the vulgar of Christianity, who possess the genuin and natural mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word <hi>Faith,</hi> untainted with the frantick conceits sprung from such speculations as are taken out of Fancy; not, as they ought, from the nature of the Thing.</p>
            <p>§ 5. The same Argument may be <note place="margin">From the nature of <hi>Holding.</hi>
               </note> made from the nature of firmly <hi>Holding,</hi> as was from <hi>Assent;</hi> and the self-same discourse, <hi>mutatis mutandis:</hi> since 'tis most Evident, none can firmly hold a thing to be <hi>true,</hi> which he sees and acknowledges, that is, <hi>holds</hi> may be <hi>False;</hi> however he may hold it <hi>Very likely to be True.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 6. The same is evinc'd from the <note place="margin">From the nature of <hi>Knowing.</hi>
               </note> notion of <hi>knowing:</hi> which word I take here abstractedly, unconcern'd what <hi>kind</hi> of knowledg it be; provided it be <hi>True</hi> and proper knowledg, and not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usively so call'd. For, since nothing can be <hi>known to be</hi> but what <hi>is,</hi> nor
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59230:26"/>
               <hi>known to be such</hi> but what <hi>is such:</hi> again since Christians, if they have either Honesty or Wit in them, must, some way or other, <hi>know</hi> points of Faith to be true, whose truth they esteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bound to profess and stand to even with the loss of their lives; it follows, those points must <hi>be</hi> what they are <hi>known to be,</hi> that is <hi>True;</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently (unless <hi>knowledg</hi> can be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) <hi>impossible not to be</hi> or to <hi>be False.</hi>

            <p>§ 7.

the Nature of Certainty consists in an <hi>Intellectual Determination</hi> thus originiz'd, and consequently, when put, excludes all possibility of being otherwise (which is the point I aym to evince) appears, partly from the Etymology, and most evidently from the Use of the Word.

               <hi>Faith,</hi> then, must be deny'd to be <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> if it be put <hi>Possible to be False.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§9. And, as my former Discourse has endeavour'd to display the Nature of <hi>Certainty</hi> from its <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Difference,</hi> which compound it's Definition; so the same will be still more satisfactorily evinc't from observing the Language of Mankind, when they use the word <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> For, that being most evidently the signification of a word which the intelligent Users of that word intend to express by it: if by divers sayings of theirs we can manifest that they meant to signifie <hi>such</hi> a Conception by that Word, <hi>that</hi> will infallibly be the true meaning of it, and that Conception will have in it the true Nature of <hi>Certainty.</hi> Let us observe then attentively what is at the bottom of their hearts, when they use these and the like familiar Discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which naturally break from them. How frequent is it, when any one asks another, <hi>Is such a thing true?</hi> and the other replies, <hi>I verily think it is;</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns upon him with this pressing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; <hi>I, but are you certain of it? may not you be mistaken?</hi> Which clearly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that that Disposition call'd <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:59230:28"/>
is beyond all Inclinations, Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or indeterminate Tendencies of the Understanding, making it <hi>verily think 'tis true,</hi> which speaks the next remove, as it were, from a certain Assent; and, consequently, that 'tis an absolute deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and fixure of the Soul that <hi>'tis true:</hi> As also, that <hi>Certainty</hi> elevates the Soul beyond hazard of <hi>mistake.</hi> Again, many times, when one is smartly questioned, if he be <hi>Certain of a thing?</hi> not daring, upon better reflexion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to Certainty, he replies warily (in a moderate word which diminishes and falls short of the other) that he is <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally certain</hi> of it; which evidences that the Notion of <hi>Certainty</hi> is in point of fixing or determining the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beyond that counterfeit Certainty, call'd <hi>Moral Certainty:</hi> Wherefore, since all <hi>Moral Certainty</hi> (as they call it) how great soever, though it be penetrated perfectly according as 'tis in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is seen to consist with a <hi>Possibility to be otherwise; True Certainty,</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds it, must needs include an <hi>Impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to be otherwise.</hi> Faith, then, is not, in true speech, <hi>Certain,</hi> unless it be <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be False.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59230:29"/>
§ 10. Again, let an Overweener, after his mistake becomes Visible, be chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd with it; we find that, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon speech, we use these or the like words, <hi>You said, or thought, You were Certain of it, but You see You are mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> Is it not Evident that the word <hi>Certain</hi> excludes a possibility of being otherwise? since his being <hi>Certain</hi> of it formerly is deny'd purely upon this score, because he was mistaken: which shews that the true notion of <hi>Certain</hi> is inconsistent with <hi>mistake;</hi> that is, that <hi>Certainty</hi> implyes Unmistakableness or, which is all one, Inerrability <hi>hîc &amp; nunc</hi> in the present affair. Whereas, had the notion of <hi>Certainty</hi> admitted <hi>a Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility not to be</hi> as he judg'd, he had not been so mistaken in judging that <hi>Certain</hi> which by actually happening not to be was shewn afterwards <hi>Possible not to be.</hi> To think to evade, by alledging that it was not meant his mistake consisted in judging that <hi>Certain</hi> or <hi>Impossible not to be,</hi> which was <hi>Possible not to be,</hi> but in judging that <hi>would be,</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>hap'd not to be,</hi> is meerly Childish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Folly amongst Men, who hold that things are carry'd on by the course
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59230:29"/>
of Cause and Effect; and that things therefore happen because a Cause puts them, or not happen because no Cause puts them. To judg, then, a thing <hi>would not be</hi> is the same, amongst Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Men, as to judg there would be <hi>no Cause</hi> to make it be; and, if there would be none such, 'tis most evident it <hi>could not be,</hi> or was <hi>Impossible to be</hi> in this order of the world. Such answers are fit for men who are led more by Sounds than Sense; and who think a different word will gain them an Escape, though that word signifies the same thing as the former.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The same will appear from the Absurdity, which palpably discovers it self in any Expression that modifies the true Notion of <hi>Certain</hi> with a Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency: as if one should say, <hi>'tis Certain per adventure,</hi> or 'tis <hi>fallibly Certain:</hi> The Nonsence of which shews that the true Notion of <hi>Certainty</hi> implies an Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitness to all Contingency, or an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility to be otherwise. You'l ask, what then must be said of the Phrase, <hi>[Moral Certainty]</hi> where <hi>Certainty</hi> seems to admit an allay of Contingency? I answer, 'tis evident even hence and from
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59230:30"/>
all my former Discourse, that the word <hi>Certainty</hi> is there us'd <hi>Catachrestically</hi> or abusively, for some great <hi>Likelihood,</hi> and its <hi>Epithet</hi> means such a degree of it as is found generally in humane exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our actions which depend on <hi>Free-will,</hi> and are contingent as being Particulars; and speaks not proper <hi>Certainty,</hi> as 'tis meant to signifie that perfect Intellectual Determination, whose Principles and Causes being high Truths, are unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Whence, <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> how high soever it be exalted and triumph in an empty name, is in reality <hi>Uncertainty;</hi> and the highest degree of <hi>Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> is the lowest degree of <hi>Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> truly so call'd; that is, of that which expresses an Intellectual Indetermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>§ 12. Thus much from the use of the word; which, when it falls naturally and unaffectedly from the tongue of the Speakers, is a proper Effect of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or meaning in their Souls, that is, of the Signification of that word; whence 'tis an apt <hi>Medium</hi> to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate that Notion, its proper Cause, <hi>à posteriori.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 13. From this Discourse follows,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59230:30"/>
first, that, since, speaking of the <hi>present,</hi> (and the same, in proportion, holds of other differences of time) 'tis the same to say, <hi>The thing is certain,</hi> as to say <hi>the thing is;</hi> and to say <hi>the thing is</hi> speaks Indivisibility; the Notion of <hi>Certainty</hi> too consists in an Indivisible. By which is not meant that one Certainty may not be greater than another, both from a greater Perfection in the Subject, and a greater certifying Power in the Object: but, that Certainty, in the way of being generated in the Soul, is either there all at once or not at all; in the same sort as there is no middle between <hi>is</hi> and <hi>is not,</hi> (or <hi>half-beings</hi> of them) which are the formal Expressers of Certainty. Whence, again, appears that what we abusively call <hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> is indeed none at all; because it reaches not that Indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Determinative Point in which True Certainty consists.</p>
            <p>§ 14. Secondly, since true Certainty <note place="margin">From the Impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that what may be false can have any Principles.</note> is caus'd in us by seeing the thing <hi>is;</hi> and this cannot be seen but by virtue of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; (especially that chief one, <hi>A thing is the same with it self)</hi> which Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples being <hi>Truths,</hi> cannot possibly be False: it follows both that what is Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59230:31"/>
cannot possibly be False, and that what can possibly be False subsists upon no Principles. Whence, all <hi>Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> as they call it, as also all high Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities, which confessedly <hi>may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be false,</hi> are convinc'd to subsist upon no Principles: and they, who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg they have but <hi>Moral Certainty</hi> and <hi>high Probabilities</hi> for their Faith or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, confess they have no Principles, which in true Language deserve that name, to ground them; but, at best, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>likely</hi> Topical <hi>Mediums</hi> that oft prove true, or hold for the most part: which may serve for a talking kind of Discourse, or Exteriour Action; but are flat things and useless when <hi>Truth</hi> is to be <hi>concluded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 15. Thirdly, it follows that true <note place="margin">From the Identity of Certainty with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility.</note> Certainty of any thing is the self-same with Infallibility or Inerrability, as to the same thing. For, <hi>Certainty</hi> is not had, till it be <hi>seen,</hi> that that First Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>[A thing is the same with it self]</hi> is engag'd for the identification of the two Notions which make up the Proposition we are <hi>Certain</hi> of; that is, for the Truth of that Proposition: Wherefore, since we can have <hi>Infallible Assurance</hi> of the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59230:31"/>
Truth of that First Principle; as also of this, that nothing can be <hi>seen to be,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it <hi>be;</hi> we can frame an Inerrable Judgment that, when we <hi>see</hi> that First Principle engag'd for the Identity of those two Notions, <hi>'tis</hi> engag'd for it, and so they identify'd; that is, we must know Infallibly that that Proposition is true. This I say in case it be a True Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and not an only deem'd or mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken one: yet even then there is a deem'd Infallibility, and the person that mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly judges himself certain of a thing, <hi>judges</hi> withall that he cannot be mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>hic &amp; nunc,</hi> in that particular, which manifests that the Notion of Certainty is the same with that of Infallibility, however it may be misapply'd. Again, since the natural use of words gives it not to be nonsence to say, [I am <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Certain</hi> of such a thing] 'tis plain that the Notion of <hi>Infallibly</hi> is not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Notion of <hi>Certain,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>competent to it: it must then be either Tautological, or else be a different yet appliable Notion, and so apt to diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or distinguish it; but it cannot be this later, for then the Notion of <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> ought in all Reason and Logick ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59230:32"/>
with equal sense the opposit diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <hi>[Fallibly]</hi> which we experience it does not; nothing being more absurd and foolish than to say, [I am <hi>fallibly certain</hi> of a thing] 'Tis clear then that <hi>infallibly</hi> is not fit to difference the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Certain,</hi> or not a different Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from it; but the same sense reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in another word for aggravations sake, as when we say, <hi>I saw it with mine own eyes;</hi> or such like; that is, if we consider it calmly, we shall find that that malignant word <hi>Infallibility</hi> which so bewonders our Opposers, amounts to no more but true <hi>Certainty,</hi> and has the self-same Notion with it.</p>
            <p>§ 16. Fourthly, it appears that, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">From the contrary opinion's unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting Faith to <hi>Chance</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency.</note> what <hi>may be otherwise,</hi> how <hi>unlikely</hi> soever, needs but a lucky chance to <hi>be so;</hi> they who say Faith may possibly be False, instead of <hi>establishing</hi> it, subject it to <hi>Chance</hi> and Contingency; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess it has no Grounds so to secure it but a greater Wit than has been formerly, may possibly <hi>shew</hi> it to be False; that is, may subvert all the Grounds it now stands on. So that these men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd not to <hi>settle</hi> Faith upon any <hi>firm Grounds,</hi> or on the Nature of the thing:
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59230:32"/>
but to <hi>hang</hi> it on <hi>Humane Wit,</hi> that is, on the Wit of the present Christians main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining its Plausibility; and, possibly, on the fortunate want of an acuter Wit than any now extant; who, when he shall arise, may perhaps outwit them, and shew all their Faith to be a ridiculous foolery.</p>
            <p>§ 17. Lastly, speaking of Truths, 'tis <note place="margin">From the Incompos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of Truth with False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</note> perfect Nonsense to say they can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be False; since 'tis a direct contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction Truth should be Falshood; as is evident in Predications of past or future things, <hi>viz.</hi> in these, <hi>Christ has dy'd, the Resurrection will be:</hi> the former of which, if once True, <hi>has been,</hi> and so <hi>cannot have not been,</hi> the Circumstance of Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone in which only it could <hi>not have been;</hi> and the later, if once put to be true, that is, to stand under certain or unimpedible Causes, is Impossible to be False, or not to succeed. So that 'tis the greatest madness and folly in the world to put either of these <hi>possible to be False.</hi> if they be once rightly judg'd Truths: and indeed I fear rather that they who judg the later <hi>possible not to be,</hi> subject them to impedible Causes; and so make them, or at least their Grounds as to our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59230:33"/>
Future Contingents, which have neither determinate Truth nor Falshood. Speaking then of those Propositions or Points of Faith which predicate <hi>de prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senti,</hi> it will be found by the Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that they are all in a matter which is <hi>unalterable,</hi> and above Contingency; and, in case this were not, their very Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the present frees them from being other than they are for the present: Every thing <hi>while it is</hi> being necessarily <hi>what it is.</hi> There is no shadow, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of Ground, for a man, who affirms Points of Faith to be Truths, to affirm withall they may <hi>possibly be False.</hi> All I can imagine in their behalf, to excuse them from speaking palpable Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, is this; that perhaps they may mean our Discourse, while <hi>in viâ</hi> to find out these Truths, was impedible, and so there was <hi>then</hi> a possibility they might not become <hi>seen to be True,</hi> that is, might be <hi>no Truths to us.</hi> But, the Question re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, Whether, in the <hi>end</hi> of our weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Motives, we discover them to be Truths or no? If not, why do we so asseverantly affirm they are? and why are we bound by Religion to profess them to be so? or, if we come to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59230:33"/>
they are <hi>Truths,</hi> how are we so stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid as not to discover withall, that they cannot possibly be Falshoods?</p>
            <p>§ 18. My last Argument from Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick <note place="margin">From the nature of <hi>Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and the Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to evince the <hi>Truth</hi> of faith.</note> shall be this, that there is no way left to prove Faith, or perswade it to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other that acts according to perfect Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, in case <hi>it,</hi> that is, its Grounds as to our knowledg, can possibly be False. And, that this is so, is not so much evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from any particular Consideration in Logick, as from the whole Nature of Artificial Discourse, or <hi>Disputation.</hi> For, in case the Premisses be but <hi>Morally Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> (as they call it) or <hi>possible to be false,</hi> that is, if the two Terms be not seen to be connected, these Propositions <hi>may,</hi> nay <hi>ought</hi> to be <hi>deny'd</hi> by the Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; whose Office and Right it is to grant nothing but what is <hi>Evident,</hi> lest he ensnare himself; but to put the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guer to prove them. What then must the Opponent or Arguer do? Must he bring a Syllogism consisting of Premisses only <hi>morally Certain</hi> or <hi>possible to be false,</hi> to make the other good? What will it avail? since these Premisses are also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable for the same reason, and so <hi>in infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum;</hi> that is, nothing at all can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59230:34"/>
be concluded finally, till Grounds <hi>impossible to be false</hi> be produced; which put, the Conclusion may be such also. Wherefore, unless Faith have Grounds <hi>impossible to be False,</hi> (and, consequently, able to shew It such also) none can <hi>Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem reddere Fidei,</hi> give a true Reason of their Faith; but such an one at best as, in due right of Dispute, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>deniable at pleasure: Whence Faith is rendred both unmaintainable or indefensible in it self, and unperswadable to others that guide themselves by perfect Reason. For, however all who discourse of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when they would convert any to Faith, use not to pin their Motives to Syllogistical Form: Yet, since no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the case of convincing the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, is allowable, but what will bear the test of true Logick; and this assures us there's no <hi>concluding</hi> any thing at all, without relying finally on Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses or Grounds <hi>impossible to be False:</hi> it follows that, how finely and quaintly soever these men talk, unless they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce such Grounds, they can <hi>conclude</hi> nothing at all; and all their importunate Perswasions, which are not reducible to these Grounds, (nay, are made use of by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59230:34"/>
Persons who declare against having any such Grounds for Faith) signifie just as much as if they should say, <hi>I beseech you, Sir, be so good natur'd as to believe me; though to tell you true, I acknowledg sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neither can I bring, nor can there possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be brought any Ground able to make good what I say, or any undeniable Premisses to force my Conclusion.</hi>

            <p>§ 2. The Position of our Adversaries <note place="margin">From the, otherwise, necessity of putting a consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of <hi>Truth</hi> with <hi>Falshood.</hi>
               </note> is still render'd more absurd by this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, that even in Nature where there is the greatest Potentiality that is, <hi>viz.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59230:35"/>
and as to the same Part or Point.</p>
            <p>§ 3. But 'tis still far more irrational, <note place="margin">From the, otherwise, necessity of putting Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories to be true.</note> in regard these seeming Contraries, (True) and (False,) apply'd to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions we speak of, have in them the perfect nature of <hi>Contradictories;</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing necessary that in those which speak <hi>de praesenti,</hi> one should be exprest by <hi>[is existent]</hi> the other by <hi>[is not existent]</hi> as 'tis in those which speak preteritly and futurely, that one should be exprest by <hi>(hath been)</hi> or <hi>(shall be,)</hi> the other by <hi>(hath not been)</hi> or <hi>(shall not be:)</hi> To think then they can at once be <hi>True</hi> and <hi>False,</hi> is to judg that Contradictories may be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of the same, or that both sides of the Contradiction may be true.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Again, Truth being a <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> 
               <note place="margin">From the, otherwise, necessity of putting it possible the minde should be at once conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the thing.</note> of the mind to the Thing, and Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood a <hi>Disconformity;</hi> to say, a Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is True, and yet possible to be False, is to say, that the mind, consider'd as judgingly conversant about that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, may be at once Conformable and Disconformable to the same thing. Too wild a Position to be introduc'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a rational nature, by any thing but such a wilful and blind passion, as must first actually corrupt, and, in fine, tend
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59230:36"/>
to destroy the very nature it self.</p>
            <p>§ 5. And, to void this Thesis from all <note place="margin">From the Impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects here so to avoid a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</note> possible evasion, here can be no different Respects according to which these Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations and Negations may be made, so to avoid Contradiction; but all such Respects are excluded, both out of the nature of the Predicate in most of those Propositions, as hath been shewn <hi>(Evict.</hi> 1. § 5.) as also out of the nature of the Points of Faith; which, standing in the abstract, descend nor to, nor meddle with subsuming Respects, but have their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions compleated in the common words which express them. And, lastly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Truths</hi> and <hi>Falshoods</hi> are not capable of Distinctions and Respects: For, however a Proposition taken into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration and scanning whether it be true or no, may admit Respects and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions, and so be affirm'd to be in this regard <hi>True,</hi> in that <hi>False;</hi> yet, what is once accepted to be True, cannot in any Respect afterwards be affirm'd possible to be not True, or False. For example, this Proposition <hi>[An Ethiopian is white]</hi> is distinguish'd by Respects to several parts, and in regard to his <hi>Teeth</hi> 'tis true; to his <hi>skin,</hi> 'tis false: But after those
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59230:36"/>
Respects have distinguish'd the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity of it, and so, by dividing it into two Propositions, settled one to be <hi>True,</hi> the other to be <hi>False,</hi> there can be no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther use of Respects or Distinctions, which are to antecede to Truth and Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by clearing the doubtfulness of Propositions, and can have no place after the <hi>Truth</hi> is once acknowledg'd, or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervene to it. He then that once ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges Points of Faith to be <hi>Truths,</hi> can have no Assistance from recourse to this and the other Respect, to evade a Contradiction when he affirms they may be False.</p>
            <p>§ 6. Again, 'tis particularly opposite <note place="margin">From the nature of the Soul.</note> to the nature of a Soul to have such an Act in her as to judg a thing <hi>True</hi> yet <hi>possible to be False</hi> at the same time. For, our Soul as to her Judging Power is es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially a Capacity of Truth; whence the First Principles which ground all Truths are so connatural to her, that she cannot but embrace them and judg them true. Nothing therefore being more opposit to Truth than a Contradiction, it follows that nothing is more impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be receiv'd or subjected in the Soul according to her Judging Power
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59230:37"/>
than a Contradiction; that is, no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatory or contradictory Act can settle there. Now, to judg a Proposition or Point to be <hi>true,</hi> is to judg the thing to <hi>exist</hi> just as it affirms; and, to judg it <hi>Possible to be False,</hi> is to judg it <hi>Possible not to exist</hi> as it affirms; and this, not in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to different times but the same; that is, to judg a Proposition or Point true yet possible to be false, is the same, as to judg the thing actually is, and yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is not at the same time; and this, as appears by our former Discourse, not to be avoided in our case by difference or diversity of Respects. Wherefore, since such an Act is not possible to be in the Judging Power of the Soul, 'tis most manifest, that he who holds one side of the Contradiction, cannot possibly hold the other; that is, he who holds Faith may be False, cannot hold that 'tis True; and that, if it be held and profest to be True, it ought also to be held and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest <hi>Impossible to be false.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 7. Moreover, the Soul, antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <note place="margin">From the necessity of putting the Soul at once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd in order to the same Point.</note> to its being inform'd by the Object, was <hi>indifferent</hi> and <hi>undetermin'd</hi> to judg it <hi>True</hi> or <hi>False,</hi> that is, to <hi>be</hi> or <hi>not to be;</hi> but, when it came afterwards through consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59230:37"/>
of the Thing or Object to judg it <hi>True,</hi> it became <hi>determin'd;</hi> and how, but by a Notion the most determinative of any other, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>being</hi> or <hi>is:</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, since to put in her at the same time a Judgment of its <hi>possibility</hi> to be <hi>False,</hi> puts her to be <hi>indetermin'd,</hi> and this in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the same, This Position puts the Soul to be at once <hi>determinate</hi> and <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate</hi> as to the same; which states are as vastly distant as <hi>actual Being</hi> and <hi>not-actual Being</hi> can remove them. Nay, this monstrous <hi>Thesis</hi> makes the Soul In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate to either side, that is to Truth as well as to Falshood, even after it had suppos'd her determin'd to Truth; For, to judg a Point <hi>possible to be False,</hi> puts the Judgment Potential or Indetermin'd as to the <hi>Falshood</hi> of it; and <hi>False</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>not-true, possible to be False</hi> must sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>possible to be not True,</hi> and so include Potentiality or Indetermination to Truth also: in regard, were it <hi>actually</hi> True, it could not be <hi>Possible to be not True,</hi> or not it self. The Soul must then be <hi>Indeterminate to either,</hi> that is, neither judg it true nor false, even after she was supposed to judg it <hi>true,</hi> in case she can then judg it <hi>possible to be false:</hi> and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,

For I ask, was it determin'd enough by any Intellectual or Rational Motives to judg the thing <hi>is?</hi> if not, what made it judg so when those Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives could not?

               </note> will be better penetrated when it shall be well consider'd in what <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Falshood</hi> formally consist; and that, taken rightly, they are certain Affections or Dispositions of our Understanding. For, that is not to be called <hi>True</hi> by me which is not <hi>True to me;</hi> not is any thing <hi>True to me,</hi> but when 'tis <hi>seen</hi> by me to be so in the Object; and to be thus
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59230:38"/>
               <hi>seen</hi> by me, is the Object to inform and actuate my Understanding Power as 'tis Judicative; whence that Power, as 'tis thus actuated, gains a Conformity to the thing it self, in which consists the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise nature of Truth. However then Truth come from the Object which is the ground or cause of it, yet 'tis formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no where but in the Understanding or Judgment; as appears evidently from this, that Truth is found in Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: now Propositions are not in the <hi>thing</hi> formally, (though, when true, they are deriv'd hence) but in the <hi>mind</hi> only, and significatively in <hi>words. Truth</hi> then is that whereby <hi>I am true</hi> or veracious when I say interiourly, <hi>the Thing is,</hi> or <hi>is thus</hi> and <hi>thus;</hi> wherefore the Truth of any Point is not had till this Actuation or Determination of my Power by the <hi>Object,</hi> which as it's Formal Cause makes this Conformity to it, be put: And, this put, to think that at the same time or at once the mind can be unactuated, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, potential or disconformable to it, is too gross a conceit to enter into the head of any man endued with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Light of Reason. Whoever then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm's Faith or those Propositions which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59230:39"/>
express Faith possible to be false, he is convinc't by the clearest Light of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (in case the desperation of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth of Faith, for want of grounds, drives him not to say any thing, but that he speaks candidly what he thinks) not to judg or say from his heart, <hi>His Faith is indeed True,</hi> having never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc't in his Soul, for want of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to put it there, that the Object or Ground of his Faith hath wrought in it that Conformity to the thing, in which <hi>Truth</hi> consists; and, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that, when he professes Points of Faith to be <hi>Truths,</hi> he either by a fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate piece of folly understands not what he sayes, or collogues and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles with God and the world for honour or some other Interest.</p>
            <p>§ 9. 'Tis hence farther demonstrated that the Position we impugn destroys <note place="margin">From the notion of <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Unity</hi>
               </note> the Notion of Metaphysical <hi>Unity,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in an Indivision or Indistinction of any Notion, Nature or Thing in it self, and a Division or Distinction of it from all other: For, according to this Tenet, <hi>Truth</hi> or the Conformity of our Understanding to the Object, put by our joynt supposition that the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               </note> Metaphysical <hi>Verity.</hi> For this Position makes the self-same mental Proposition or Disposition of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding we call <hi>Truth,</hi> possible to be <hi>Falshood;</hi> that is, <hi>Possible not to be the same with it self,</hi> which subverts all <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysical Verity;</hi> that is, the Foundation or ground of all <hi>Formal Verity</hi> or Truth in the World.</p>

            <p>§ 12. I make no question but my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries will think to elude the force of these three last Demonstrations, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59230:40"/>
of some others by alleadging that they deny absolutely Truth can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be Falshood, and that they mean only that though the Points of Faith ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear now upon considerable Motives to be True, yet those Motives secure it not from being absolutely False; but not so that they can really be <hi>both.</hi> And I grant this would be a good Answer, in case they did not affirm Points of Faith to be really <hi>True,</hi> (upon which Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taken from the common <hi>Language</hi> and Sentiments of all that profess Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, even theirs too as Christians I proceed) but only profest they were <hi>Likely to be True;</hi> for then it would be so far from following that Truth could be Falshood, or that the same Points could be <hi>both</hi> true and not true at once, that, in that case, it would follow they ought to affirm they were <hi>neither</hi> True <hi>nor</hi> False; since <hi>likely to be True</hi> and <hi>True indeed</hi> are no more the <hi>same,</hi> than a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue which is <hi>like</hi> a man is the same with a <hi>man.</hi> But, if all Christians be bound to profess, and themselves actually do so, that their Faith is <hi>indeed True,</hi> then let us see how they will avoid the consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of my former discourse, when they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59230:40"/>
assert it withall <hi>Possible to be False.</hi> For it is that very individual judgment they make concerning a Point of Faith, or an Act of Faith, which they must affirm to be True or a Truth, that is conformable to the thing; and 'tis of the self-same Judgment, though call'd by them a <hi>Truth,</hi> of which they affirm that 'tis <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be False,</hi> or disconformable to the Object: And, this is not so meant as if it should become so afterwards, either by some Alteration of that Judgment into another, or of the thing to which it is Conformable; but that even that very self-same Judgment, while they speak and hold it after their Fashion <hi>True,</hi> may <hi>even then</hi> possibly be <hi>False;</hi> from which 'tis evident, that for want of solid Grounds to settle Poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

be conceiv'd to agree to the Subject suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively, for their sense is that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position <hi>[a Trinity is,</hi> &amp;c.] may (for any thing they know) even now possibly be False while they pronounce it true.

               </note> object that I mistake them and impose upon them to relate their Discourse to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59230:42"/>
the real Being of the thing as it stands in the thing it self, whereas they intend it only to mean the thing as standing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Notion, or consider'd according to divers Motives they either have or may have to perswade or disswade them as to the Verity of it; and in plain terms that they mean only this; that Faith is not so conveniently proposed to them but that the grounds of it for any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears evidently are possible to be False. I answer, that I also speak of the thing as standing under Notion, else how could I put it in Propositions, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course from the nature and contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness of those Propositions as I do all along? But yet, lest my Notions should be aiery and empty, I am careful to take them from the nature of the thing, and to rate the Truth of my Propositions from the Conformity they have to the Object as in it self; and the force of my Motives from the relation they have to First Principles; and then I am sure to discourse and speak solidly. The same I expect from them: Whence I ask them, whether they assent to this Proposition, <hi>[A Trinity is Existent]</hi> that is, judg it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and <hi>indeed True,</hi> or not? If not, I
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59230:42"/>
argue not against them at present, but leave them to be confuted by the natural Sentiments, and punsh'd by the abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all that profess themselves Christians, even their own party; of whom I have so good an Opinion that they will heartily abominate that man who shall make any difficulty to profess and maintain that there is <hi>indeed</hi> a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or that his Faith is <hi>True.</hi> But, in case they do assent indeed to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, <hi>[A Trinity is]</hi> or judg it <hi>True,</hi> then I contend farther that they must be forc't likewise to affirm it to be so in the thing in it self as they predicate; that is, there is found in the same Thing or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what corresponds to the Notion of <hi>Trinity</hi> and the Notion of <hi>Existent;</hi> which put, and that they thus judg it to pass in the <hi>Thing,</hi> I affirm that, out of the formal Opposition between <hi>Existent</hi> and <hi>not-Existent,</hi> and their Incompossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the same subject, which they cannot but know, it follows necessarily that they must judg it Impossible it should be not-Existent, or that that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position should be false at the same time they judg it true and the thing existent; nor ever afterwards, unless the thing

As <hi>real existence</hi> so ultimately determines and actuates the Thing in which it is, that it excludes, while there, all possibility of <hi>real non-Existence:</hi> so Intellectual or <hi>Iudg'd Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence</hi> exprest by the word <hi>[is]</hi> so ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately determines and actuates the Soul as to its Judging Power, that it excludes, whiles there, all Possibility of <hi>judg'd non-Existence;</hi> in such sort, that (the Soul being by Nature fram'd a Capacity of Truth) 'tis no less Impossible it can <hi>judg</hi> a thing may be and may not be at once, than 'tis that a thing should at once be and not be <hi>in reality.</hi> Again, I affirm that, 'tis equally impossible the Motive, which (in case she acts ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally) convinces the Soul the Thing <hi>is,</hi> should consist with a Possibility of it's <hi>not Being,</hi> as 'tis that the Soul can at once <hi>judg</hi> it <hi>to be</hi> and <hi>not to be,</hi> or that the thing can <hi>both be</hi> and <hi>not be really;</hi> since this Motive was the <hi>Cause</hi> of the other <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and an <hi>Effect</hi> of the Thing's <hi>Being so in reality;</hi> and depends on the same Incompossibility of Being and not-Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or on the simplicity of the Notion

               <hi>is;</hi> and, lastly, on a Maxim as evident as what is most; namely, that <hi>the same is the same with it self.</hi> Whence I make account whoever has sufficient Grounds to affirm a Point of Faith <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>is true,</hi> that is, is more than <hi>Likely to be True,</hi> has withall true Grounds to affirm it <hi>Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be False;</hi> and that, who confesses it <hi>Possible to be False,</hi> disclaims any true Grounds of judging or professing it <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>is True;</hi> and so judges it in his heart to be but a high <hi>Probability</hi> or a good <hi>Likelihood</hi> at most, which is enough for plausible Talkers, but falls far short of making a man a true Christian.</p>
            <p>§ 3. And, hence, we may with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and pitty reflect upon the pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of Heresy, in corrupting the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, that eye whose defect <hi>fills</hi> (as our Saviour discourses it) <hi>the whole Body with darkness;</hi> by subverting funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally all those Principles in which the Common Light of all Knowledg consists; and perverting (as much as the Goodness of Nature establish't by our Creator will suffer it) that very Faculty which makes us <hi>Men</hi> in what is most Intrinsecal and Essential to it, the knowledg of the first Principles,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59230:44"/>
that is, despoiling it quite of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Perfection due to it's nature: But to return to our Arguments.</p>
            <p>§ 4. Can any discourse be taken high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than from first Principles? Yes, in some sort there can; that is, from the <hi>First Cause</hi> or <hi>Being,</hi> or, <hi>à Patre Lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, the Father of lights,</hi> from whom all created Natures, whence those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are borrowed, and the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Understanding it self, where they are found, derive their Origin. This <hi>First Being</hi> Metaphysicks demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate to be <hi>Self Existent,</hi> that is, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit and Unlimited in Existence, and consequently in all perfections; amongst which, since to be a <hi>Self-determination</hi> to act according to right Reason is one, God <hi>has</hi> or rather <hi>is</hi> that too. It being then according to right Reason to <hi>do</hi> what is <hi>seen</hi> clearly to be <hi>best,</hi> all things consider'd; God, seeing what is absolutely Best, must therefore be Self-determin'd to <hi>do</hi> still what is <hi>Best.</hi> This put, looking into the notions of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Best,</hi> we find them to be both <hi>relative,</hi> and that what is <hi>good to none</hi> is <hi>is not good at all:</hi> Applying which to God's Perfection every way Infinit
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59230:44"/>
and no way farther perfectible, 'tis seen manifestly that when he is said to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate exteriourly in this world what is <hi>Best,</hi> it cannot mean what is Good or Best to <hi>Himself,</hi> or any thing which is His <hi>own Good,</hi> or Perfection, but, what is good or best to <hi>his Creatures.</hi> And hence we settle this most comfortable, most evident and most enlightning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, that <hi>God does what's best for his Creatures.</hi> And, it being evidently Best for them to be guided or govern'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true natures which he has given them, it follows also that God governs his Creatures connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, or sutably to their right natures.</p>
            <p>§ 5 Hence it follows that, if we can once demonstrate that to Act thus or thus is most Connatural to such a <hi>Species</hi> or Nature, we can demonstrate from the Highest, First, Best and most Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Cause, that, however Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency finds place in divers particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, yet that <hi>kind,</hi> as 'tis subjected to Gods guidance, is govern'd most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to its true and right nature, which his Creative Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness had at first given it.</p>
            <p>§ 6 Particularly, 'tis consequent that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59230:45"/>
it cannot be God should command or expect from his Creatures what is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit to the true Nature he had given them. For, since their being what they are, or their Metaphysical Verity is fixt by the <hi>Idea's</hi> in his own divine Understanding, from which in their Creation they unerringly flow'd, hence, as to put them at first was to act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to himself or his own Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, so, to violate them, is to work Disconformably and unlike to himself; which it cannot be thought God should do through Inclination or Choice, and as little be made to do it through force.</p>
            <p>§ 7. Again, since we can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise discourse of God but by such Notions as we gather here from Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which, however <hi>improper,</hi> yet all grant to be <hi>truly</hi> pronounc't of him if they signify Perfection; Hence, if we can demonstratively evince that such an Action is truly agreeable to Wisdom, Goodness, Mercy, &amp;c. and such others disagreeable, we can know Demonstratively that <hi>those</hi> are worthy to proceed from him, <hi>These</hi> Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have so infinitely perfect an Author.</p>

§ 8. What use may be made of this <note place="margin">From the nature of the <hi>First Cause,</hi> or the <hi>Deity.</hi>
               </note> Principle of Supream Wisdom <hi>[God does what is best for his Creatures]</hi> will be seen hereafter. The use we make of it at present, is to adde a new degree of establishment to our former Discourses by applying it to them. I argue then thus: Since 'tis agreeable to <hi>rational Nature,</hi> or rather since 'tis the very Nature it self, not to hold any thing but upon the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of Immediate Connexion, or seeing that the first Principle of all rational discourse, <hi>[The same is the same with it self]</hi> is engag'd for the Truth both of the Premisses and Consequence; since Assents not thus abetted are but <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and, as such, deprave Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; since nothing but <hi>true Certainty</hi> can fix the Understanding in a stead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Judgment; since 'tis connatural to Rational Nature to proceed upon <hi>Principles,</hi> which is not to be had where there is Possibility of Falshood; since this Possibility renders Faith unmain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable; and so, contrary to rational nature, makes Christians hold and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess what they cannot make good; since the putting Points of Faith to be Truths, yet possible to be False, puts the Soul in violent and Incompossible States, as of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59230:46"/>
Indetermination and Determination, Conformity and Disconformity to the Object; nay subjects her to the judging Contradictions True, which is most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to her Nature; since it subverts all the Principles of our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, both Logically and Metaphysically consider'd, that is radically and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally destroys all possible <hi>Rationali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> since it destroys the Nature of <hi>Faith</hi> it self, and by consequence the stability of all the Natures in the world; since, I say, these things are so, as hath been particularly prov'd in my precedent Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses, it follows that 'tis the greatest Impossibility that God, who does the best for his Creatures, can govern or manage his Darling-Creature, <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> on this preternatural fashion: But, 'tis Certain that the way to arrive at Faith is particularly <hi>laid</hi> by Gods <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and so is an especial part of his <hi>Government</hi> of Mankind; 'tis known also and acknowledg'd that he has <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded</hi> us to profess the <hi>Truth</hi> of our Faith in due occasions; Therefore, 'tis Impossible the Means, Grounds or Rule of Faith, and, consequently, Faith it self, should be capable to be False; Seeing this last Position, joyn'd to the

understanding as such; that is, 'tis to him a <hi>Knowledg,</hi> and so informs his mind with <hi>Truths.</hi> The Nature of Faith then forces that Points of Faith must be <hi>Truths,</hi> and, so, as is manifoldly demonstrated, Faith it self is not possible to be False.</p>
            <p>§ 9. Again, this Intellectual <hi>Virtue</hi>

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59230:50"/>
is <hi>apply'd</hi> to our Understanding; and consequently, more forcibly works its effects there, or subducs it to Assent; whence this Certitude is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>against</hi> the nature of Belief, that 'tis most manifest it <hi>strengthens</hi> and <hi>perfects</hi> it under that Notion. <hi>Divine Faith</hi> then being <hi>Supernatural,</hi> has a peculiar right to have such an Application of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority to the understanding, as may be truly Certain or Impossible to be False; since by such an Application 'tis most evident that not <hi>less</hi> but <hi>more Belief</hi> is given to the said Authority, and the understanding becomes more humbled and subjected to it; that is, by such an Application, how scientifically evident soever it be, the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> is never the nearer being an Act of <hi>Science,</hi> but is perfecter under the very Notion of an <hi>Act of Faith;</hi> being still a steadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, heartier, and firmer <hi>Assent for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority's</hi> sake, which is thus strongly and closely apply'd, and a greater Reliance on it.</p>
            <p>§ 12. Moreover, Faith being to work through Charity, and to guide our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">From the requisite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Christian Action should proceed from the Acters in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectest manner.</note> as we are Christians; and rational actions being so much more perfect by
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59230:50"/>
how much more <hi>knowingly</hi> they proceed from the Agent; unless Faith were truly <hi>Certain,</hi> that is, <hi>Impossible to be false,</hi> Christian action would fall short of the Perfection found in most ordinary Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions of an inferiour and (in comparison) trifling concern; and a Christian would go to work with less assuredness and steadiness than a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter and Cobler; and this, not out of the Impediments of Original Sin, (which is Contingent and Extrinsecal to Faith or Religion) but meerly out of a defect of Certainty in the Intrinsecals of Faith it self and it's Grounds; which beyond all evasion, affixes the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection upon Christianity it self.</p>
            <p>§ 13. I may add, that Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, <note place="margin">That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise Christian Religion would be more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in point of Principles than any other Art or Science.</note> ev'n the most slight and inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ones, and which are most lyable to Contingency in their Effects or the Actions springing from them, have yet all of them Certainty in their <hi>Principles.

THe foregoing Considerations are more enforc'd by this, that <note place="margin">From Faith's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Knowledg of our last <hi>End,</hi> and of the <hi>way</hi> to it.</note> Faith is the Light which discovers to us our <hi>Last End</hi> and the <hi>Way to it;</hi> that is, which is to guide us in that to which all our other Concerns are subservient, and all our Actions directed. Unless there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Knowledg or Light of Faith be steady and firm, all our whole Life, as Christians, would be feeble, tott'ring and uneven: as wanting Certainty of the First Practical Principles which are to ground our Christian Behaviour; nay, Certainty of the <hi>End</hi> we should aim at, without which the whole Course of our Life must needs be staggering and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, and it self but a blind groping in the dark.</p>

§ 2. Moreover, since all Mankind, <note place="margin">From the Certainty the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens had of the Principles of their imperfect Morality.</note> even the Heathens themselves, had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Evidence and Certainty of the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Principles of Natural Morality, which grounded their Moral (seeming) Virtues, as is confest; which Virtues yet, for want of the Light of Faith teaching them to <hi>know</hi> their true last End, and so perform the Acts of those Virtues for it's sake, or order them to Heaven, fell short of elevating them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it and bringing them thither: It follows that, had there not been provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made that Points of Faith, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Christian</hi> Morality, should be as Certain as were the other, things would have been perversly order'd; that is, greater care would have been taken to create those imperfect Dispositions of the Soul, which alone were not able to secure one man from the State of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Misery, than for those Sublime Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, call'd <hi>Christian Virtues,</hi> which are the direct steps for man to arrive at Eternal Bliss, and the Immediate means to attain the End he was created for, the Sight of God.</p>
            <p>§ 3. Especially, since this Last End <note place="margin">From mans last End being only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al means.</note> and Chief Good of Mankind is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable

by <hi>External</hi> Actions or <hi>Local Motions;</hi> but <hi>Intellectually,</hi> or by Interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Acts of the Soul; by which he is promoted forwards even to the very as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of it; that is, by force of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> exciting him to act, and guiding him in those actions: 'Tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, the Points of Faith must be <hi>Truths,</hi> and so, as has been manifoldly prov'd above, <hi>Impissible to be false.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. Again, <hi>Virtues</hi> spring connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally <note place="margin">From <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue's</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Effect of <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> of <hi>False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi>
               </note> from <hi>Truths,</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> from <hi>False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods:</hi> If Faith then be <hi>Possibly False,</hi> the Practises springing thence are <hi>Possibly no Virtues</hi> but <hi>Vices;</hi> and, so, they, and consequently, Faith, whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, possibly would not dispose, but indispose us towards our last End; which destroyes perfectly the Notion of <hi>Faith</hi> and Virtues too. <hi>Faith,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, would be no <hi>Faith,</hi> were it possible to be False.</p>
            <p>§ 5. You'l object, a Reason merely Probable or Morally-Certain is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make Us act for a Temporal Good; much more, then, for an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Infinite one; since the greater Goodness is in the Object, the less is the hazard; and consequently the more
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:59230:52"/>
the Reasonableness to act for it. I answer, though, if all other things cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>responded, the Objection would be Valid, and the reason given for it, speaking abstractedly, be really Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive: Yet, in our present case, there are so many things which make it Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel that no Shadow of Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can be made from the one to the other. First, for the reason lately given; <hi>Viz.</hi> because our Last End be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it self Spiritual and most Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is not attainable but by Means of <hi>Best Spiritual</hi> Perfections or Virtues; and the more <hi>knowingly</hi> these proceed from Us the better they are; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that saying, <hi>None is cordially and solidly good, who knows not why he ought to be good:</hi> whence they cannot be <hi>Best</hi> in their kinde, nor, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Means fit to attain that End, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they proceed at least, from <hi>True Knowledg;</hi> which cannot be had by a mere Probability, how high soever it be. Whereas, Material and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Goods depend not on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant course of Causes or Dispositions towards them knowable by us: but very frequently, if not equally on a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59230:53"/>
Chanceable or Contingent cast of Things; whence we use to say, <hi>Fools have the best Fortune.</hi> Hence, the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending</hi> and <hi>directing</hi> part in such Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons depends on the Knowledg of some particulars; but the Attainment is carry'd on by Material Means: nay, very frequently, there is no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg at all requisit in any respect. For Example, He that, by the death of a hundred Relations in a Plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time should alone survive and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit their Estates, would be really rich, whither any interiour Act of his minde in the least contributed to it or not; that is, though he never <hi>desir'd,</hi> aim'd at, or even <hi>thought</hi> of it. But, if a Man in time of persecution and Martyrdom should say within himself, <hi>I cannot believe there is a God or a Next World; Yet Ile venture to dye rather then deny them; in hopes that, if perhaps there be such a thing or state, he will give me a far greater reward:</hi> such a Man I dare affirm to be no nearer gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heaven by this Act no better prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled, than if he had never had any such Act at all; in regard he wanted that First necessary disposition which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59230:53"/>
               <hi>St. Paul</hi> and Connaturality require; <hi>Accedentem ad Deum oportet credere quia Deus est.</hi> Heb. 11. v. 6.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Again, Faith is intended for a <note place="margin">From the otherwise Inability of Fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

But, alas, how unactive had their Charity and Zeal been: how dull their desire to forego all present Goods, ev'n life too among the rest; if this wicked Doctrine had been in their hearts, that perhaps all was a <hi>lye,</hi> which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, suff'red, and dy'd for! And, how coldly and timorously would they have look'd Death in the face,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59230:54"/>
having perfect Certainty on one side that they were about to lose all the known Goods they possest, for others unknown and uncertain? Well may a Natural sincerity preserve diverse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who are out of the Church mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally honest and innocent: but we must not hope for any eminent Sanctity or Heroick Act of Virtue from any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of such a Faith, if they follow their Teachers, maintaining there are no stronger Motives for the Truth of Christianity, to comfort and establish the Souls of the Faithful. And 'tis to be feared that, though their highly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited Probability or Moral Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty (as they call it) be enough to <hi>Exclude Actual Doubt,</hi> while Men are in a state of Security and all things go well with them; Yet it will scarce be able to preserve them from <hi>doubting Actually,</hi> when they are upon the point of foregoing all the Goods they at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent enjoy, and are so highly concern'd to be Certain of the Existence of those Future ones they hope for in lieu of them.</p>
            <p>§ 7. Moreover, we are perfectly Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <note place="margin">From the, otherwise,</note> by manifest Experience, of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:59230:54"/>
of Temporal Goods, <hi>viz.</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, <note place="margin">Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of Spiritual Goods, or the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness of them in the next life.</note> Pleasures, Riches, &amp;c. or, that such things are in the world; whereas, unless Faith be truly Certain, that is, <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be false,</hi> the Generality of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> cannot be perfectly assur'd ev'n of the <hi>Existence</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> or those Future Goods for which they are to relinquish all present ones. Wherefore, the Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the thing being the first and main <hi>Basis</hi> of all Humane Action, and the Ground of all the other Motives: 'tis clear there's a manifest difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween acting for Heaven and for Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Goods, ev'n in this respect, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Parallel may be pretended in some other Considerations. Besides, all acting ev'n for Temporal Goods were unjustifyable, unless those Goods be held <hi>Attainable;</hi> and <hi>de facto</hi> we are perfectly certain that Honours, Pleasures, Riches, &amp;c. not only <hi>exist,</hi> but are of such a nature also as they may be <hi>attained</hi> to, due means us'd; since we experience multitudes of men <hi>have</hi> and <hi>do</hi> daily ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at them. But, ev'n, though Heav'n be held to <hi>be,</hi> yet it cannot be held to be <hi>attainable,</hi> unless the Proposals of Faith be Certain; since neither have those
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59230:55"/>
who are to come to Faith seen nor experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd any man get Heav'n, nor discours'd with any whom they know to have come thence and seen it. So that I fear, were the Objection, concerning the Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Probable Motives to make us act for Inferiour or Humane Goods, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly clear'd, it would be found not to mean that <hi>Probability</hi> of those Humane Good's <hi>Existence</hi> or <hi>Attainableness</hi> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for example, that there are Riches in common, or that they may be gotten one way or other, both which are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed to the Action as certainly known: but it seems to mean only this, that men ought to proceed to Action though there be but Moral Certainty or great Likelihood that those Goods are actually to be attain'd in this or that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of Time or Place, or by such or such means, as, by sending Ships to the Indies, inventing Water-works, Husbandry, Souldiery, and the like: which assertion held within its bounds will break no squares; seeing ev'n in the actual attainment of Heav'n <hi>by me</hi> or <hi>by this particular way or means,</hi> when those means depend on material Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there is found the same room for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59230:55"/>
failure and contingency, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Certainty of Heav'ns <hi>Existence</hi> and <hi>Attainableness</hi> in common, secur'd to us perfectly by Faith. For, though <hi>Virtue practic'd</hi> is an Infallible Way to bring Souls to Bliss; yet no man has Certainty that any Extrinsecal State he puts himself into, or material means he uses, will make him truly vertuous, or finally get him the end he aims at: but must content himself with Likelihoods, or the seeming-betterness of his putting himself in that State or Circumstance, or his using this or that means; in the same manner as it happens when he acts for Temporary Goods; and, for the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, leave it humbly in the hands of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, or <hi>miserentis Dei,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging with <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>in mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus tuis Domine sortes meae,</hi> and working out his Salvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>

For, however the Will may set the Understanding to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Motive; yet it must be the Truth of the Object's Goodness, or the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59230:56"/>
clearness of the Proposal of it, which only can oblige connaturally the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to conceit it as it ought, and consequently the Will to love it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: in which <hi>conceiting</hi> and heartily <hi>loving</hi> not onely the Intending and Commanding part of the Action is plac'd in our case, as it happens in our acting for material Goods; but also the Executive and Assecutive Parts of it. Not the same sleightness of Motive; therefore, or Moral Certainty, will here serve the turn; but true Certainty or Impossibility of Falshood is requir'd: this being the best and properest to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a hearty, lively, steady, and all-over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering Affection for Heav'n; and such as may (as it ought) make Christians practically repute all other things as <hi>Dung</hi> in comparison of That.</p>
            <p>§ 9. But, the main consideration <note place="margin">From the Incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries nor su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable by <hi>any</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be False.</hi>
               </note> which forces the Certainty of <hi>Faith</hi> and the Motives which are to beget it, (that is, of the <hi>Rule of Faith)</hi> above those which ground our Action of pursuing Temporary Goods, is the unconceivable Mysteriousness of the Points of Faith: Truths exalted above the ordinary Course of Nature as far as Heav'n is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59230:56"/>
above the Earth: Many of them look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so odd and uncouth to our course Humane Reason unrefin'd by Faith, that, as they seem'd of old <hi>to the Greeks Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness,</hi> so still they are acknowledgedly most unsuitable to the grossness of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, by which the Generality of the world, especially those who are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elevated by Christian Principles, are led; and confessedly <hi>above Reason;</hi> insomuch as it costs the best Wits of Christianity no small pains to maintain them not to be Contradictory or <hi>Impossible to be True.</hi> Putting, then, the Motives of Faith, and consequently Faith it self, <hi>Possible to be False;</hi> the only seeming Certainty (I might say, the confest want of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty) of the Motives to believe would be so counterballanc'd by the Incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness and seeming Contradict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>riness of the Thing or Object, or rather indeed <hi>overballanc'd</hi> in the Conceit of all those who are yet to embrace Faith; that there would be no over-plus of weight left to incline them to hold those Points <hi>True</hi> rather than <hi>False:</hi> much less to make them absolutely hold they <hi>are</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Truths. And, he that sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uld assert the contrary, I wonder how he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59230:57"/>
would go about to prove it, or by what Standard he would measure whether is the greater of the two counterpos'd Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likelihoods, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>possibly false</hi> Motive of Faith should hap to be <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> such, or that the <hi>seeming-Impossibility</hi> in the Objects should chance to be a <hi>real one.</hi> For, 'tis not enough to say here that we are in reason to expect the Divine Nature should be exceedingly exalted above its Creatures, and incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and therefore we are not to measure his Perfections by the ordinary Rules found in Creatures, but think it reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able he should infinitely exceed them: For, however this has weight in Points of Faith which concern the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and its Perfections as in it self, yet here it will not serve the turn, in regard Faith teaches us many other Points <hi>seemingly</hi> repugnant to the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it self, and most strangely debasing and vilifying it; as, that God, infinitely happy in himself, should be expos'd to injurious Bufferings, Scourgings, and an ignominious Death, for a Creatures sake that, in comparison of him, is a meer Nothing; and that Omniscience and Omnipotence could not invent and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59230:57"/>
practice some easier and more honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way to work the End they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, lastly, that it should beseem Infinite Goodness that a Person superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively innocent should be so severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht, to do an undue favour to those who were enormously wicked, This consideration, then, necessitates plainly the <hi>Impossibility of Faith's being false;</hi> for else 'twould be irrational to believe it. And lastly, it shews the case of Christian Interiour Acts utterly unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to that of Acting Exteriourly for sensible and material Goods; which one may apprehend to <hi>be attainable;</hi> and also comprehend the <hi>Way</hi> to attain them, without puzz'ling his Understanding with any unconceivable mysteriousness in the business to check his Assent.</p>
            <p>E're I leave this Point, I must desire the Reader to reflect well on the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion those persons are in who are yet to embrace Faith. They have no Light but their pure Natural Reason, and to this are propos'd for Objects to the one side the Motives to Faith, or the Authority (in our case) that God has spoke it; on the other the strangeness of the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Let then those persons under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings

no better elevated, go about to scan the profound Mysteries of Faith, 'tis clear, and I think confest by all, they must needs seem to them <hi>Impossible to be True;</hi> which therefore nothing but a Motive of its own nature seemingly <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be false,</hi> can conquer so as to make them conceit them really <hi>True.</hi> But this Motive or this Rule of Faith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by our Adversaries <hi>Possible to be false;</hi> nor (it being a fit and proportion'd Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for Humane Reason) is there any thing to make it seem better than it is, or <hi>Impossible to be false;</hi> 'tis then against all reason to <hi>believe,</hi> were Faith and its Grounds <hi>Possible to be false;</hi> the Motives of Dissent being in that case evidently greater than are the Motives of Assent.</p>

Oftentimes indeed they deny Faith to be <hi>Evidence</hi> or Science, and affirm it to be <hi>Obscure:</hi> but what's this to the purpose? while all Relyance on Authority is obscure; and Certain Knowledg can be had by means of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as appears in diverse Instances of <hi>Humane Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. Particularly, waving the former, we will reflect on some places more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly assertive of our Position; as, that of the Prince of the Apostles, <hi>Acts 2. 36. Certissimè sciat ergo omnis Domus Israel,</hi> &amp;c. Where, about to bring them to Faith, he exprest it to be <hi>A most certain Knowledg,</hi> and this Attainable by the <hi>whole House of Israel,</hi> which must mean the Generality at least.</p>
            <p>§ 5. I add, (omitting many others) two of his Fellow-Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi> The first, <hi>Col. 1. 23. Si tamen permanetis in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de fundati, &amp; stabiles et immobiles à spe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelii:</hi> Now, how any one can be founded or <hi>grounded</hi> in Faith, if Faith be <hi>Possible to be False,</hi> that is <hi>(Eviction.</hi> 2. § 14.) have no <hi>Foundation,</hi> Principles or Grounds it self; how any one can be <hi>Stable</hi> and <hi>Immoveable</hi> in a Persuasion,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59230:60"/>
which very Persuasion and its Grounds may not only be <hi>moved</hi> but <hi>overthrown</hi> &amp; subverted (as must inevitably follow, if it be <hi>possible to be False.)</hi> I expect to be inform'd by Mr. <hi>Tilletson</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet.</hi> Do these words sound onely an Exclusion of <hi>Actual Doubt,</hi> or <hi>Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion</hi> of it at present, which Protestant Writers make sufficient to an Act of Faith? or rather does it not mean that which of its own nature is such as can admit <hi>no Possible</hi> Cause of Doubt at any time for the <hi>future?</hi> Let them dispense a while with pursuing their affected Gay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses in the <hi>Out-sides</hi> of words, and take the pains to look into their <hi>Meanings;</hi> and then, if they can make out that <hi>Groundedness, Stability</hi> and <hi>Immobility</hi> can consist with <hi>Possibility of falshood,</hi> I shall promise them my utmost endeavour to hold Contradictions with them; for, in that case, those would be the onely Truths.</p>
            <p>§ 6. The second shall be that most em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatical one of the same Apostle. <hi>Licèt nos aut Angelus de coelo annuntiaverit vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis praeter id quod accepistis, Anathema sit. Though we or an Angel from heaven should preach to you otherwise than you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd,</hi>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:59230:61"/>
               <hi>let him be Accursed.</hi> Which were a very rude and unreasonable carriage (especially for us Christians now adays) were Faith <hi>Possible to be False,</hi> and so, short of the credit due to so Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Authorities: For since 'tis known that many things which have seem'd, (that I may use Mr. <hi>T's</hi> words) <hi>morally impossible to be False,</hi> have prov'd to be <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>indeed False,</hi> and 'tis granted that 'tis always <hi>possible to be so:</hi> but it was never <hi>heard</hi> that an Apostle of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> or an <hi>Angel from heaven could,</hi> or at least did <hi>at any time</hi> preach False: 'tis most manifest that nothing which was <hi>Possible to be false,</hi> can with any reason su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain it self against the force of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and that Faith, which ought to do so, must be <hi>Impossible to be False.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 7. From the Language and Sense of the Saints and Christians of former <note place="margin">From Faith's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plac'd beyond <hi>Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencie.</hi>
               </note> times, let us come nearer home, and see how unsuitable 'tis to the Notions and Expressions of present Christianity, to say, <hi>Faith is possible to be False.</hi> Now, the Possibility of Faith's Falshood, is built on the Contingency of the Motives which are to ground it: for, were there no Contingency in them, but that their
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59230:61"/>
Causes were so laid, that 'twere impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they should not be Conclusive, they could not possibly fail of being able to conclude; and so Faith would of its own nature be <hi>Impossible to be False.</hi> Considering, then, the Nature of <hi>Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency,</hi> whether Speculatively in it self, or Practically in Instances wherein 'tis found, we may observe that it implies a certain kind of Proportion between the frequency of Effects on the one side, and the Seldomness on the other: which we usually express by <hi>Ten to one, a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand to one</hi> &amp;c. If then Faith be <hi>Possible to be False,</hi> its Nature will bear, nay ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to express the probable degree of its Likelihood in such kind of Language; and that we assert it to be <hi>likely</hi> in such a proportion, but <hi>not-likely</hi> in a higher: for example, it would be perhaps wise and agreeable to the Nature of the Thing, as thus propos'd, to say, <hi>v. g. 'Tis a hundred to one</hi> there is a Trinity, a Heaven or a Hell; but 'tis <hi>not a Thousand to one</hi> that there are any such things. Or, if any contend I have assign'd too-small an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-proportion to Faiths <hi>Likelihood;</hi> yet at least he must grant that, in a greater, it would inevitably follow, that such lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59230:62"/>
ought, in True speaking, be used, when we are to express the <hi>degree</hi> of Faith's Firmness. Wherefore, it being experientially manifest, that nothing sounds more ugly to a Christian ear, than to say, that 'tis <hi>so many to one</hi> Faith is True, but <hi>not so many more:</hi> 'tis evident that the Nature of Faith is plac'd <hi>beyond</hi> all Proportions of its <hi>failing</hi> to its <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and all degrees of Contingency; that is, 'tis <hi>Impossible to be False.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 6. Moreover, to say, <hi>'Tis a thousand</hi> 
               <note place="margin">From the manner in which Christians express themselves when they profess their Faith</note> 
               <hi>to one Faith is True,</hi> or <hi>there is a Trinity,</hi> is not to say, <hi>'Tis True,</hi> or <hi>There is a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> Christians, therefore, ought in due candor, then when they are to profess their Faith, express onely how much o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-proportion, in a Moral Estimation, its Likelihood bears to its Unlikelihood; and not to stand <hi>telling a Lie,</hi> when they are to make <hi>Profession of their Faith;</hi> say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>'Tis True,</hi> when 'tis onely to such a degree <hi>Likely to be True;</hi> that is, <hi>Lying,</hi> when they should be doing a chief duty of <hi>Religion.</hi> And, which is worst of all, as being not onely most unwise and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent, but most diabolically wicked and impudent, <hi>to stand stiff</hi> in the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that <hi>Ly,</hi> though they hazard the loss of their <hi>Estates,</hi> and even <hi>Lives</hi> too,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59230:62"/>
by the bargain. Yet, this imputation of such a most foolish and most damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly-dishonest Obstinacy is Unavoidably to be affixt upon Christians, if they thus profess their Faith <hi>True,</hi> in case it be <hi>Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be false;</hi> that is, in case it be <hi>onely a thousand to one</hi> (for example) <hi>that 'tis True.</hi> If it be said, they saw not perhaps this possibility of Falshood, and so acted virtuously in that Absolute Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of its Truth, because of their good meaning; the Answer is ready: First, that Mr. <hi>Tillotson,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and such who maintain, and, so, if they write what they think, see Faith <hi>Possible to be False,</hi> are bound not to profess Faith to be <hi>True,</hi> and to forewarn others not to make such a <hi>Lying</hi> Profession: Next, that if God have commanded us to make such a Profession, as all Christians grant he has; then, not onely their <hi>Meaning,</hi> but the <hi>Act</hi> it self is good and laudable. Which, joyn'd to these mens Principles, and their Natural Consequences laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in our former Discourse, signifies that Dishonesty is Honesty, and a most foolish and wicked Obstinacy a high Virtue, as being commanded by God: Nay, that God is the Author of <hi>Sin,</hi>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:59230:63"/>
commanding them to tell a <hi>Ly</hi> in Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their Faith <hi>True.</hi> Positions most abominable, as well as contradictory; but 'tis most fit the Nature of all <hi>Goodness</hi> should go to wrack, when the Nature of <hi>Truth</hi> is once violated.</p>
            <p>§ 7. Again, if Contingency have place in Faiths <hi>Basis,</hi> there must be some <hi>stint</hi> of <note place="margin">From this, that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to lay a wager Christian Faith is a <hi>Ly.</hi>
               </note> this Contingency, according to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral estimation of things: be it then, for Example, a thousand to one, or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proportion you please, for it alters not the present case: If then it be <hi>but</hi> a thousand to one Faith is True, then 'tis <hi>One to a thousand</hi> 'tis <hi>not-true,</hi> that is, it will bear a Wager that Faith is a <hi>Ly;</hi> and a Christian, according to these Principles may, without injury to his Faith or its Grounds, and with a great deal of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, <hi>lay a wager</hi> that his Faith is actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly False. Nay, if he get any one to cope with him at excessive odds; he is bound in Reason and Prudence to undertake him, and lay a wager all Christian Faith is a Ly. Which sounding highest Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety in the ears of all reputed Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, of what Sect soever, that govern themselves by the Natural conceit they have of Faith; 'tis plain that the Nature
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59230:63"/>
of Faith is plac'd beyond all Contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of failing, that is, all <hi>Possibility of Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> If it be objected, such a Wager could never be try'd, and so, it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in Prudence come to be layd: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, my Discourse is unconcern'd how able or unable mans Understanding is to decide it, and onely contends that the Nature of the thing, that is, of Faith no better settled, would bear or justify it; which is unavoidably consequent.</p>
            <p>§ 8. Particularly, 'tis strange that <note place="margin">
                  <hi>From the</hi> Carriage of the Martyrs, <hi>if suppos'd</hi> Honest <hi>&amp;</hi> Prudent.</note> none of the Christian Martyrs, who from time to time have dy'd for their Faith, should when their life lay at stake, endeavour to mitigate the fury of their Persecutors with such like language. <hi>I beseech you, (Great</hi> Nero; <hi>or</hi> Dioclesian!) <hi>understand us Christians right: we deny not absolutely the possibility of your opposit Tenets being true, nor assert our own Faith so far as to say it may not possibly be False.

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59230:64"/>
we dare venture a thousand to one (or perhaps something more) that our Faith is true; yet for all that we shall not stick to lay one to a thousand 'tis false.</hi> These had been moderate and mollifying Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and questionless might have sav'd the lives of very many: which why they should not have used, they being (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our Adversaries Principles) <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>honest to profess them,</hi> and highly <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> to do it, their lives being concern'd; nay, <hi>Consciencious</hi> too, (for there is none but holds it highly sinful to conceal any Truth which may save <hi>another</hi> mans life) no other reason can be given but this, that the <hi>Possibility of Faiths falshood</hi> had never enter'd into their hearts; but they held Gods promises of a better life full as Certain, as was their present possession of this, or present determination of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it for Christ's Name. All their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions sounded the <hi>Certainty</hi> of the Truth they profest, and their most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Hopes grounded upon that Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. Nor did any of the circumstant Faithfull ever judg them too lavish of their bloud, for standing so stiff upon their avowing the <hi>rigorous Truth</hi> of their Faith, and the Falshood of its Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59230:64"/>
but always esteem'd their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction no less <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>Honest,</hi> than it was <hi>Undaunted.</hi> What kind of Profession of his Faith a Protestant, thus principled, would make, in case of imminent Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, I know not; but I should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem my self the foolishest Knave living to tell aly to hang my self, by professing my Faith <hi>true,</hi> which I could never hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily judg it to be, whilst I held it <hi>Possible to be False;</hi> and so, at best, onely <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be True.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 9 Note here, that I have conceded very much in yeilding a thousand to one of the Likelyhood of Christian Faith in the Protestant Grounds without Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions <hi>Certainty,</hi> which they deny: rather, taking in the Incredibleness of the Mysteries, it would be (in that Hypothesis) above five to one, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing modestly, that all Faith is False. For, since 'tis Evident the Certainty of Books cannot be had at all without the Certainty of Tradition; and Protestants deny the Certainty of Tradition, and bring multitudes of exceptions against it (as may be seen in Mr. <hi>Tillotson</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, or rather Abuse of <hi>Sure Footing)</hi> there is some degree of Incredibleness
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59230:65"/>
in the right Conveyance of Christ's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hitherto: to which difficulty add the Incredibleness of the Mysteryes themselves, exceedingly enhauncing the other; 'tis manifest there would be a high disadvantage on Faith's side. Nay, granting a pretty high Probability (which is perhaps as much, as they care for) yet, the not-onely Improbability, but seeming-Impossibility of the Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Faith, if taken, not as standing under Authority, but as Objects of our Humane Reason (as in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ballancing case they ought to be) would quite overpoise the Probable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and incline the Soul strongly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Dissent, unless Interest, Custom, or some other Affection come in to the Assistance of the weaker Motive, Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in a bigger Letter, and dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the difficulty in the Object by not letting it be considered or penetrated, that is, by hindring the working of <hi>Right Reason.</hi> Now, in this case, if this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course holds, a Protestant may with a safe Conscience lay odds, and wager two to one at least, his Faith is all a F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </note> of the Generality of the Faithful professing Faith, we come next to the Practise of the <hi>Wits</hi> of Christianity; not proceeding as <hi>Speculaters</hi> and <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars</hi> (a most trifling impertinent Topick when we are speaking of Faith, yet most frequently us'd by our Adversaries, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> who are obstinately bent to practise that wilful mistake) but as <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi> or <hi>Faithful:</hi> and this, not only acting or speaking <hi>in Abstraction</hi> from Humane Knowledg, but as in <hi>direct Opposition</hi> to it, and (as it were) in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance and despight of it.

               </note> will perhaps be brought nearer home, and so be better penetrated even by our Opposers themselves, if we reflect how wickedly it would sound from the mouth of Preachers; if, after a Sermon, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and pressing the Faithful to the <hi>Love of Heaven,</hi> or particularly, <hi>to stand stedfast in their Faith,</hi> they should in the close, to prevent in their Auditors the misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing some overstraining Expressions, add an ingenuous caution, That they should not, for all that, adhere to Faith as if it <hi>could not be False,</hi> nor work for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as if there were any <hi>absolute Certainty</hi> of the being of any such a Thing. Is it not manifest, this (in our case) honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing Profession would enervate the force of all the Motives they had propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and prest? And, if so, is it not as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59230:69"/>
that all the efficacy of Christian Preaching springs naturally from the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility that Faith should be False?</hi> For, 'tis not only the Unseasonableness of this Profession, but the Impiousness of it, which would so scandalize the Hearers; and either avert them from the Preacher, or make them cold in Virtue. 'Tis clear, then, that all the forceable Application of Christian Motives to the hearts of the Generality of the Faithful, is grounded on the Impossibility of Faith's Falshood: and that, therefore, he who holds the opposite <hi>Tenet,</hi> and would be honest, should either leave off Preaching, for which this <hi>Tenet</hi> makes him unfit; or else use much caution while he preaches, least, by implying the perfect Certainty of Faith, while he practises Assentation to That, he becomes Injurious to Truth, and consequently to It too, if it be True.</p>

Yet, neither of these different States enters into the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> I have of <hi>Man,</hi> but meerly what is common to the Thing, under either State, which is what answers to the <hi>definition;</hi> for, both Man, taken as in himself, is a <hi>rational Creature;</hi> and also what I <hi>conceive,</hi> or <hi>mean</hi> by the word <hi>[Man]</hi> is <hi>rational Creature;</hi> though the words <hi>[rational Creature]</hi> express nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the being <hi>in</hi> my Minde nor <hi>out</hi> of it, but abstract from either. By this means my Mind concieving <hi>Man</hi> gains an <hi>Unity of form</hi> with the Thing <hi>out</hi> of it, or a <hi>Conformity</hi> to it: which Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:59230:73"/>
wants nothing to be call'd <hi>Truth,</hi> but that 'tis incapable of grounding <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi> or <hi>Negation;</hi> the bare <hi>meaning</hi> of the word <hi>[Man]</hi> neither implying <hi>[is]</hi> nor <hi>[is not]</hi> Whence Truth and Falshood are usuall said to be incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the first Operation of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</p>
               <p>We will make way to the Second O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of our Understanding by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Instance of the first. Imagin then there is propos'd to my Eye a <hi>Round Pillar;</hi> which it affects, and by it my Brain, and, so, my Understanding; it cannot fail to beget there a simple Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, and consequently a Notion of what is directly imprinted; which is, that Thing with as many of its qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations as were apt to be convey'd in by means of that sense, confusedly blended together; as also (by my Experience that it affects or <hi>is</hi> affecting me) of it's <hi>Existence.</hi> Moreover, as Occasion, or indeed Nature guides me, I may have distinct or abstracted notions of Pillar, Roundness and Existence, nay more of Pillar and Roundness as exercising or actually having the same existence; or, which is all one, of what is <hi>meant</hi> by this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59230:74"/>
Proposition, <hi>[the Pillar is round]</hi> that is, of what corresponds to those three distinct notions, put now in a frame of a Proposition, and, so immediately apt to express Truth or Falshood; and yet not proceed to behave my self affirmingly or denyingly, or <hi>judg</hi> any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, but meerly to <hi>conceive</hi> what is <hi>meant</hi> by those words.</p>
               <p>Way being thus orderly made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Second Operation of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding by disposing the separate notions in a fitting posture by the First; nature seems to require It should super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene; and, so, the Understanding sets it self to <hi>judg</hi> whether those Extream or distant notions, exhibited by the First in the posture of Connexion, be <hi>indeed</hi> connected or no; the standard or measure of which is to be taken from the <hi>Thing.</hi> Now in <hi>self-evident</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions and First Principles the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding guides it self by that imbred or nature-taught <hi>Principium Intellectûs; [The same is the same with it's self]</hi> In <hi>deduc't</hi> Propositions; by the same Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple fundamentally, or originally, and immediately by this, <hi>[Those notions which are the same with a Third, are the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59230:74"/>
same with one another,]</hi> But, in our present Instance, Experience alone suffices to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the understanding, supposing the obvious knowledg of what <hi>Pillar</hi> and <hi>Roundness</hi> are, and that a Pillar is a <hi>Thing,</hi> whereas Roundness without Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is <hi>none,</hi> but onely an Affection or determination of a Thing; both known by plain Nature, whatever som School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men speculate. For, these put, meer Experience teaches us that that thing which is call'd <hi>Pillar,</hi> is the same thing which is call'd <hi>Round,</hi> or, which is all one, that in this Proposition, <hi>[The Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is round]</hi> the two extream notions are <hi>indeed,</hi> (that is, with a Conformity to the Thing) identifi'd, or that that Proposition is <hi>True.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return home to our purpose: 'Tis clear that <hi>Pillar</hi> and <hi>Roundness Existing by the same existence</hi> or in the same Thing, are found in the thing after it's manner, and in my Judgment (or Soul as apt to judg) after it's, that is judgingly: But Truth hath nothing to do with either of these <hi>manners</hi> of Being (as was discourst former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the parallel case of <hi>Notions)</hi> but purely and adequately consists in the <hi>Unity</hi> or <hi>Community of Form</hi> which my
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:59230:75"/>
Judgment has with the Thing; by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving which in her, the Soul gains a <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> to it. In this Common Form consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd <hi>as in the Thing,</hi> consists it's <hi>Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Verity,</hi> or it's <hi>Being what it is;</hi> and this Verity, consider'd as <hi>apt to</hi> stamp or <hi>imprint it self on my Iudging</hi> Power, is call'd <hi>Objective Truth; as receiv'd in me,</hi> and <hi>fashioning</hi> or <hi>conforming</hi> my said Power to the Thing as in it self, and so making my Judgment <hi>True;</hi> 'tis call'd <hi>Formal Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This declar'd, I deny that I any where confound <hi>Objective Truth</hi> with <hi>Formal,</hi> or what's <hi>in the Thing,</hi> with what's in me <hi>as in me;</hi> for, that were to identifie those two most vastly and most evidently dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent States: A Supineness too gross for any attentive Discourser to fall into I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive then what the Objecter would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is, that I confound those Truths spoken of with Truth <hi>to us,</hi> or <hi>quoad nos,</hi> as the Schools speak. For, though what's <hi>Truth to us</hi> must needs be Truth <hi>in it self,</hi> and <hi>in us,</hi> in regard we cannot know that to <hi>be</hi> which <hi>is not;</hi> yet what's Truth <hi>in it self,</hi> or Truth <hi>in us,</hi> is not therefore Truth <hi>to us,</hi> in regard one may upon <hi>probable,</hi> nay <hi>improbable,</hi> or even <hi>False</hi> Grounds, light upon a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59230:75"/>
in which case his mind as judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is conformable to the thing or <hi>True:</hi> yet, still, that thing is not true <hi>to him,</hi> in regard he hath no reason able to <hi>conclude</hi> it such, or to make him <hi>see</hi> it to be true. <hi>Truth</hi> then <hi>to us,</hi> is the same with our <hi>Sight</hi> of it; that is, with Certainty or Determination of our Understanding by force of Intellectual Motives; and, this indeed I often seem to confound with Truth in the two former Accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but I therefore <hi>seem</hi> to do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am loath to transcribe and apply so often my <hi>Postulata,</hi> and suppose my Judicious Reader bears them in mind. Which if he pleases to understand as subjoyn'd to those Discourses, it will follow that what <hi>is so</hi> in the thing it self, or perhaps <hi>in us,</hi> if it be so severely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory to be thus constantly profest and held so, and consequently (by my later <hi>Postulatum)</hi> necessary to be <hi>known</hi> to be so, all my mistaken proofs will be brought to conclude it <hi>True to us,</hi> that is, <hi>Certain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will say, why is it not enough for God to provide that our Acts of Faith be indeed <hi>True in us,</hi> since, so, they would perfect our Understandings by
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:59230:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conforming them to the thing; and guide us right; but they must also be <hi>True to us,</hi> or be <hi>known</hi> to be <hi>True.</hi> I answer, for two Reasons. One, because God's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Mankind would by this means be preternatural, obliging him to hold, profess, and dye for professing the <hi>Truth</hi> of those Points which he <hi>knows not</hi> to be such. The other Reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every Act of Faith as exercis'd would perpetually involve an <hi>Errour,</hi> in case the Motives to those Assents were not conclusive of the Truth of those Points: For, however one may light by hap-hazard, or through weakness on a Truth from an Inclusive Motive, yet, since 'tis impossible a rational Creature should assent but upon <hi>some Motive,</hi> good or bad; hence, every Assent practically implies <hi>['Tis true for this reason]</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the Reason grounding such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents be unapt to conclude the Truth of the thing, that Judgment necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves a Falshood or Errour; however it be, otherwise, conformable to the thing abstractedly consider'd.

               <p>A great part of the First Eviction, in case it proceed concerning <hi>Truth in us,</hi> as it ought, supposes the vulgar Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Logick, and to frame their Thoughts and Assents in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as Artificial Discoursers do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> It supposes no <hi>Skill</hi> or Art in the vulgar or Generality of Christians, but onely declares <hi>artificially</hi> what <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> passes in rational Souls when they Assent upon Evidence. And this it ought to do; For the Art of Logick frames not it's Rules or Observations at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but takes them from the Thing or it's Object (as all other Skills do) that is, from what is found in ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Souls <hi>as rational,</hi> or apt to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: by observing the motions of which when it behaves it self rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Logicians set down Rules how to demean our Thoughts steadily and constantly according to right Reason: So that the manner of working in Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial discoursers in this onely differs from that of Natural ones, that the one acts <hi>directly</hi> the other <hi>reflectingly.</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:59230:79"/>
For example, a vulgar Soul when it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents interiourly <hi>a thing is,</hi> or <hi>affirms,</hi> has truly in it what a Logician call's a <hi>Proposition;</hi> and that Proposition has truly in it what corresponds to the notions of <hi>Subject, Copula,</hi> and <hi>Predicate;</hi> though he reflects not on it, as does a Logician. In the same manner when he gathers the Knowledg of some new Thing, he has truly in that <hi>discourse</hi> of his what corresponds to <hi>Major, Minor</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</hi> nay he has practically in him what necessitates the Consequence or that Maxim <hi>[The same is the same with it self]</hi> of whose Truth, it being a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of our Understanding, he cannot possibly be ignorant. Though all this while he reflects not <hi>how</hi> or by virtue of what he acquires this Knowledg.</p>
               <p>And hence Light is afforded us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand in common how the vulgar come to have <hi>Practical Self-Evidence</hi> of divers Truths: For, the Maxims which even scientifical men have of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of several Sciences, being taken from the <hi>Things</hi> or the <hi>Objects</hi> of those Sciences; and (those Maxims being <hi>Common</hi> or General ones) from the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious</hi> or <hi>common</hi> Knowledg of those
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59230:80"/>
things, which the vulgar who convers with them cannot chuse but have; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, nature imbuing them with the Knowledg of that Principle on which the force of all Consequences is Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as also with the knowledg of all those we call <hi>Principia Intellectûs,</hi> or <hi>Principles of our Understanding,</hi> hence their rational nature is led directly by a natural course to <hi>see evidently</hi> and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to divers Conclusions, without any Reflexion or Speculation; which rude but unerring draught of Knowledg is call'd by me in <hi>Sure Footing</hi> and elswhere <hi>Practical Self-evidence,</hi> because 'tis a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Result of Practice or ordinary converse with those things; An Instance would at once clear this, and, if rightly chosen, be serviceable to the Readers of <hi>Sure Footing.</hi> An unlearned person that cannot read a word believes fully there was such a man as K. <hi>Iames;</hi> and that we may not mistake the Question, we will put him to be one that has a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som degree of conversation in the world. We finde him assent to the Affirmative heartily; But the point is <hi>how</hi> he is led into that Assent, and whether rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? To ask him a reason <hi>why,</hi> is boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59230:80"/>
for this puts him to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self like a Reflecter on his own Thoughts, which he is not: whence we shall find him, upon such a question, at a puzzle to give the particular reason; though, as taught by Experience, he will stand stiffly to it in common that he has a reason for it, and a good one too. To help him out then, the way is to suggest the true reason to him, for then he will easily acknowledg it, finding it experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally in himself; which done, deny the Goodness of it, and you shall find, he will, as taught by nature stand to it, and deliver himself in some rude saying or other in behalf of it. For example, tell him he believes there was a K. <hi>Iames</hi> because those who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live then have told us so; but what if they were <hi>mistaken?</hi> His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer would in likelihood be to this purpose; <hi>what a God's name were they blind in those dayes, that they could not see who was King then?</hi> Which expresses naturally his conceit of their Inerrable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in such a point, in case they had eyes, which nature taught him men generally have. Insist farther; Perhaps they were not <hi>mistaken,</hi> but had a mind
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59230:81"/>
to cozen all England that came after them. Nature will lead him to this or some such kind of Reply; <hi>To what purpose should they all make fools of every body?</hi> Which words, though rudely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, yet couch in themselves the full reason given in <hi>Sure Footing,</hi> as far as 'tis built on Nature. For, first, it implies that man's nature with which he hath a fair acquaintance in common is to do a thing for a <hi>purpose, end</hi> or <hi>reason.</hi> Next, his Interrogatory way is in his rude style, equivalent to a Negative, and so it signifies <hi>there could be no reason</hi> for it; and, lastly, his standing to his former Tenet implies virtually a <hi>Conclusion</hi> from the reason given, that the thing could not be done; which involves necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a knowledg of that First Principle on which all force of consequence is grounded; and also of that Principle, <hi>no Effect can be without a due Cause;</hi> both perfectly <hi>suppos'd</hi> and <hi>held</hi> by him, though not exprest in his rude Enthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meme.</p>
               <p>From this discourse is collected what this <hi>Practical Self-evidence</hi> is; and, that 'tis distinguish'd from Experience in this, that Experience is onely found of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59230:81"/>
what uses to make the <hi>Minor</hi> in this vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual discourse, but Practical Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is of Conclusions deduc't (as it were) from a common maxim naturally known, as the <hi>Major;</hi> and a <hi>Minor</hi> (for the most part) experientially, or else Practically known; which, joyn'd with the Self-evident Principle in which the force of Consequence consists, make up that virtual discourse. Again, it differs from <hi>Science,</hi> in that a man of Science reflectingly sees a <hi>Medium</hi> iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the two Extreames, and is aware of the virtue of those Causes which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Evidence; whereas the other is rather Passive from Natural Impressions than Active by any Self-industry in these Knowledges, and rather <hi>feels</hi> the force of those Causes in his own Adhesion, than <hi>sees</hi> it. Secondly, 'Tis collected that this <hi>Practical Self-evidence</hi> is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, <hi>True Knowledge;</hi> though, perhaps, it be the sleightest kind of it; in which 'tis differenc't from <hi>Opinion</hi> built on probabilities. For, seeing such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters have both by Experience or by Common Conversation <hi>true</hi> Knowledg of the natures of diverse things in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which make the <hi>Minor,</hi> as also by

Nature of all the Principles of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, which countervail the <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor,</hi> and force the Consequence; it comes to pass that this Practical Self-evidence is intirely and adequately grounded on <hi>true Knowledges</hi> both as to Premises and Consequence; and cossequently 'tis it self a <hi>True Knowledg</hi> likewise. Which consideration will help to explain my later <hi>Postulatum,</hi> and shew by what means 'tis possible all Christians may <hi>know</hi> their Faith to be <hi>True,</hi> or the same the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles taught, by the Churches <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie,</hi> because they know the Inerra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness and Veracity of vast and grave multitudes in open matters of Fact which are practiceable daily.

               <p>That first Principle <hi>[Every thing while it is, is necessarily what it is]</hi> seems to be

often times misapply'd, particularly E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict. 2. § 11. &amp; 13. to <hi>Truth at present;</hi> whence the Arguer would conclude that 'tis Impossible that a thing should be also at present False.

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> I mean in those places Truth <hi>to us,</hi> or Certainty: But, the Objection proceeds as if there were but <hi>one</hi> man in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59230:83"/>
the world, or as if <hi>True, False, Certain</hi> and <hi>Uncertain</hi> could be relative to <hi>one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> only. First, then, my Position is that, whoever puts a thing <hi>True to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> yet possible to be <hi>False to another,</hi> puts no less a capacity of the thing's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at once thus True and False though in <hi>several</hi> Subjects, than as if it were in <hi>one</hi> Subject <hi>onely.</hi> Next, he supposes each of those different Judgers to have possibly just Grounds for so judging, since he puts in one Motives sufficient to evince the <hi>Truth</hi> of the thing, in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, possible ones to conclude it's <hi>False<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</hi> For our Question is not, to what degree <hi>weak</hi> Souls can <hi>miscarry</hi> in assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but what degree of <hi>strength</hi> is found in the <hi>Motives</hi> to Faith; which, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecter, <hi>as a Christian,</hi> that is, as a <hi>Holder</hi> that Points of Faith are <hi>Truths,</hi> must af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to be sufficient to conclude it <hi>True;</hi> and yet, as himself contends, leaves it still <hi>Possible to be False;</hi> that is, proveable by other Grounds to <hi>be so;</hi> for, else, the word <hi>False,</hi> cannot mean False <hi>to us,</hi> or <hi>in the Subject,</hi> as is pretended; that is, he must make it possible to be justly or <hi>in right reason, held</hi> by one <hi>True,</hi> by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>False.</hi> Now 'tis the Impossibility
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59230:83"/>
of such opposite Grounds I constantly maintain; or that the Grounds of Faith are <hi>Impossible to be False.</hi> Thirdly, hence I go farther and urge, that, if those diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Motives can oblige justly one man to hold Faith <hi>True,</hi> the other to hold it <hi>False,</hi> then, putting them in the same man, it ought to oblige him to hold both sides of the Contradiction: and this enforces my proofs of this nature in my Third Eviction. I know it will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily answe'rd, that this will not follow; because, the Motives being disparate, the more probable one would, when in the same subject, over-power the other, and so hinder the opposite Assent. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it may be consider'd that Intellectual Motives or Reasons have their power to <hi>bind</hi> the Understanding to Assent, not from their relation to other extrinsecall Proofs corresponding or discorrespond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, but from the Truth of the Premisses on which they intrinsecal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend, and the Goodness of the Consequence; and, finally, by virtue of their being built on first or self-evident Principles. If then the Motives one man has at present be sufficient of their own nature to oblige him, acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59230:84"/>
to right reason, to judg Faith True; who ever has humane Reason <hi>ought</hi> to assent upon them: and, if Faith be still possible to be <hi>False,</hi> that is, <hi>False to us;</hi> that is, be <hi>possible to be shown False,</hi> or possible that others may have <hi>just</hi> ground to hold it so, put those Grounds also in the <hi>same</hi> man, and, since they must be convictive of humane understanding, they ought to have their formal Effect where they are; that is, convince it of Faith's Falshood too; which however absurd, yet 'tis the genuine and necessary sequel of this Source of Absurdities, viz. <hi>That Faith and its Rule may possibly be False.</hi> How the force of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is avoidable but by alledging that no man acting according to right reason has just grounds to hold his Faith <hi>True to us,</hi> or can ever have just Grounds to hold it <hi>False to us,</hi> (which is to deny the Possibility of Faith's Falshood to us, the Opposers own position) I profess my self utterly unable to discern. Now, he that holds these Positions is a perfect Sceptick or a Pyrrhonian as to matters of Religion; since he puts an absolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperateness of knowing the Truth on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, in that matter or subject.</p>

he were very wicked who would thus disgrace or diminish Faith, if he did not know his Position to be a Truth; whence follows that such a man must not onely say, <hi>I know not but it may be False;</hi> but he must, if he will speak out what he thinks, be oblig'd to say, <hi>I know it may be False;</hi> however he be loath to declare Categorically and sincerely his Tenet in so odious a Point, or hazard his credit with the Generality of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, whose Sentiment he contradicts so expresly.</p>

                  </gap> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be enough for Faith to be as Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to us Christians, as it was to those immediately before the Flood, that the whole world should not be drown'd, which exceeds the case of <hi>America</hi>'s pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible destruction; or, as it was to those after the Flood, that the Sun should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver stand still or go back; or, lastly, as it is that a house, of whose Firmness none had actual doubt, should fall? If so, then the <hi>Standing</hi> of the Sun in <hi>Ioshuah</hi>'s time, and it's <hi>Retrogradation</hi> in <hi>Ezekiah</hi>'s, show the unparallelness of these Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. You'l say these were both miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. But, this alters not the case; first, because it was never heard, nor can it be held by any sober man, that even <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi> can make such <hi>Truths, Falshoods;</hi> or those Motives, which are of their own nature able to conclude the <hi>Truth</hi> of any such Points, <hi>Inconclusive</hi> or Invalid. Next, because, if the <hi>Motives</hi> to Faith, and so <hi>Faith</hi> it self are <hi>Possible to be false</hi> for any thing we know, 'tis Impossible to give a satisfactory Answer to a Deist, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59230:86"/>
how, in case they should prove <hi>indeed</hi> False, we can be assur'd Gods Goodness to Mankind will not step in even <hi>miraculously</hi> to discover the vanity of so universal an Illusion, and the Abuse of Falshoods so absurdly imposing upon the world, as to obtain the highest repute of Sacred and Divine Truths.</p>
               <p>Concerning the last Instance of the Moral Certainty of a houses standing, which hath been objected to me by learned Protestants, as sufficient to make me act as steadily and heartily as if I had a Demonstration that it would not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fall, besides the General Answer that Points of Faith are <hi>Truths,</hi> which renders the case unparallel; I reply, that the two houses, <hi>the one in Holborn,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Kings Street,</hi> which of late years, &amp; a third in <hi>Cock Lane,</hi> which of late days fell, when none had the least <hi>actual doubt</hi> or <hi>suspicion of doubt</hi> of it, else surely they would never have staid in them, inform us sufficiently to what a changeable, tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and ruinous condition Christian Faith would be reduc'd by these Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Parallels: No fewer than three Houses fell in the compass of a short time, and none had the least <hi>suspicion of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59230:87"/>
doubt</hi> beforehand of such an Event; therefore, may an Atheist say, <hi>Down falls Christian Faith too,</hi> whose Foundation was (by this Doctrin) but Parallel for strength to the other; or, if it fall not in so long time, it has only something <hi>better luck,</hi> not <hi>better grounds</hi> than had the three Houses.</p>
               <p>As for the objected <hi>Unsuitableness</hi> of such a Certainty as I require, 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, that nothing is more natural for the Generality of Mankind, than to be led by Authority; nothing more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrable by those of all sorts than the Infallibleness and Veracity of exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly vast and grave Authorities rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting matter of Fact, as we experience in their beleef that there was a Q. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> and such like; to <hi>comprehend</hi> and <hi>assent immovably</hi> to which costs them not the least over straining, as the Obiecter imagins. Which being so, I make account that God both in his power and wisdom <hi>could,</hi> &amp; in his Goodness <hi>would</hi> render the Authority of his Church, <hi>the Ground and Pillar of Truth,</hi> as evident to all her Children, both as to its Inerrableness and Veracity as the other; nay incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably more, it being in every regard so requisit.</p>

               <p>If the Motives to Faith must be <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be False to us,</hi> they would <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily</hi> conclude the <hi>Truth</hi> of Faith; wherefore they would, of themselves, <hi>oblige</hi> the Understanding to assent, and so there would need no precedent <hi>pious affection</hi> of the Will; which yet both Councils, Fathers, and Catholick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines with one consent require.

               </p>

                  <hi>Answer.</hi> If Experience teaches us that even assent to Humane Sciences, though <hi>Evident</hi> from Intrinsecal reasons, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible</hi> by our Understanding, and purely <hi>Speculative,</hi> is not to be acquir'd without an affection to see Truth; as is evident from the carriage of meer Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who having entertain'd a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of it's <hi>hopelesness,</hi> come thence to want Love or Affection for it, and so never come to see it, how <hi>Conclusive</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the reasons be. Much more by far must some good affection be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requisit to assent to Divine and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59230:88"/>
Truths, which are <hi>Obscure</hi> in themselves, as depending upon Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; <hi>Incomprehensible</hi> to our natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and <hi>Practical,</hi> that is obligingly-Efficacious to break out into Christian Action or Love of Heaven above all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary things, as <hi>True Faith</hi> must be. The First obstacle of the three mention'd has this difficulty, that the beams of Truth, which come directly from the things themselves are generally apt to strike our Understanding more natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, penetrate it more deeply, and to stick in it more immovably, than those which are reflected to us from the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of another, such as are Points of Faith; besides the new difficulty of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Veracity</hi> of the <hi>Attester,</hi> which, how evident soever it be, yet it puts the Understanding to double pains; whereas, Evidence had from the <hi>Thing</hi> is but a <hi>single</hi> labour, and so less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding and distracting the thought.</p>
               <p>The Second Obstacle, <hi>Incomprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness</hi> is apt to stupify the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and retard Assent; nay even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it from <hi>considering</hi> them as <hi>Truths;</hi> The Atheistical temper of the world (which could not subsist were Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59230:88"/>
duly advanc'd) sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us how difficult it is for men to apply and fix their thoughts upon those considerabilities in things and those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which are <hi>abstracted from matter;</hi> the reason whereof is, because it being natural that our Fancy be in act while our Understanding is so, and there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not <hi>Proper</hi> Phantasms, (the onely agreeable ones to material men, who are not strong enough to guide their Judgments purely by Principles and Connexions of Terms) which sute to such abstracted Conceptions, but <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical</hi> ones onely, which the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing must in rigour deny to be right ones, even while by necessity 'tis forc't to make use of them; Hence the life of a Christian, as such, being <hi>to serve God in Spirit and Truth,</hi> and, so, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Principles of his new Life for the most part and principally <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> ones, it comes to pass that for this very regard alone, there will need a great love of Truth and Spiritual Goods to make the Understanding appliable to them, or even admit a consideration of them. I was told by a worthy Friend of mine that discoursing with an acute
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59230:89"/>
man, but a great hater of Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks, and mentioning <hi>a Spirit,</hi> he in a disgust broke out into these words <hi>[Let us talk of what we know.]</hi> By which expression 'tis manifest that he mistook the Question <hi>An est,</hi> for <hi>Quid est;</hi> But what makes for my purpose is, that the <hi>unknowableness</hi> of the Essence or nature of a Spirit to us in this State, obstructed even his <hi>desire</hi> to <hi>consider</hi> whether there were any such thing or no; &amp; consequently that there needs a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry desire or affection to know Spiritual things, to make us willing even to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain a <hi>thought</hi> of their <hi>being,</hi> much more to <hi>conceit</hi> it. But incomparably more needful is such an Affection, when to the <hi>Spirituality</hi> of those points there shall be added an <hi>Incomprehensibleness,</hi> nay, if onely those points be consider'd, an Incredibleness; when no <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel</hi> can be found in Nature, nor scarce any <hi>similitude</hi> weakly to <hi>shadow</hi> out the thing and it's possibility; nay, when some of those points directly <hi>thwart</hi> the course of <hi>natural</hi> Causes, whence all our other Knowledges have their Stability. Then, I say, if ever there is requisit an Affection for the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:59230:89"/>
Nobleness and Excellency of those high Spiritual Objects, to make us willing to hearken to any Authority proposing them, how evident soever the Motives be for the Credibleness of that Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>The third Obstacle follows, taken from the <hi>End</hi> for which Faith is essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>ordain'd,</hi> that is, from what it essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially <hi>is, viz.</hi> a mover of the Will to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> and Goodness, or a <hi>Practical</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now, nothing is more evident than this Truth, that by-affections and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary inclinations are apt to hinder the understanding from assenting, or even at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending candidly and calmly to these Reasons, (how clear soever they be) which make against any beloved Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; whence, there needs a <hi>contrary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> to these other, to remove the mists those passions had rais'd, and purge the Eye of the Mind, that so it may become capable of discerning what it could not before, though in it self most visible. How much more, (not only requisite but even) necessary must some <hi>pious affection</hi> be to permit the mind freely to embrace the doctrin of Christian Faith, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principles which enjoyn a disregard
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59230:90"/>
and posthabition of all that is sweet to Flesh and Blood, nay even of Livelihood and Life it self.</p>
               <p>'Tis most manifest then that a <hi>Plous Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> pre-requisit to Faith, derogates nothing from it's <hi>Certainty,</hi> but is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly consistent with the <hi>Evidence</hi> of those Motives which are to generate it; and that the Governours and Officers of the Church, though proposing the most convincing reasons in the world for the Authority conveying down Faith to us, can prevail nothing, unless the Great Governour of the world and Giver of every good gift, by his peculiar Power, plant antecedently in their hearts this good disposition, and prepare <hi>terram bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> that their endeavours may take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and the Sowers Seed take root; no more than <hi>Paul,</hi> though <hi>miraculous,</hi> could convert all that saw his Miracles or heard his Preaching, but only such whose hearts God open'd as he did <hi>Lydia's.</hi> It appears also by the same discourse how the Acts of Faith are <hi>free,</hi> that is, as depending on this pious disposition of the Will, which sets the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on work to consider the Motives, and so produce them. The whole Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59230:90"/>
Action is <hi>free,</hi> because the Will <hi>orders it;</hi> though she do not <hi>produce</hi> it all, or though <hi>freedom</hi> be not formally in the Body: so the Act of Faith is <hi>free,</hi> because it is order'd by the <hi>Will</hi> which is <hi>free;</hi> though no freedom be found in the Understanding, which is incapable of such a qualification, but pure <hi>necessity of assenting</hi> when the Motives are seen to be Conclusive.</p>
               <p>No need then is there upon any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a <hi>pious disposition</hi> of the Will to peece out the defect of the Reasons <hi>why</hi> we believe, and to oblige the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing to assent <hi>beyond</hi> the Motive; that is, assent, <hi>to a degree,</hi> beyond what it had reason to do. An Impossibility in Humane Nature rightly and connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally govern'd, and (I much fear) no small disgrace to Christian Faith; considering the obstinate bent of the Church's Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries to confound the Speculative Thoughts of Divines, explaining Faith and its Grounds less carefully, with their Sentiments issuing naturally from them as Christians, nay with the Doctrin of the Catholick Church it self. What can revincingly be reply'd to an Atheist, objecting on this occasion that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59230:91"/>
make the <hi>Evidence</hi> of Faith's grounds stand need to be pecc'd out by <hi>Obscurity;</hi> our <hi>Knowledg</hi> of them by <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and the <hi>Rationality</hi> of them by <hi>Will without Reason,</hi> that is, <hi>Willfulness.</hi> Wherefore I carnestly obtest and beseech, even <hi>per viscera Christi,</hi> all who shall read this Treatise, and yet have <hi>Speculatively</hi> held and maintain'd this Opinion I here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn, (for <hi>practically,</hi> and as <hi>Christians,</hi> they hold the contrary Conclusion) se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously to weigh the Point once more, and not to obstruct the Resolving Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith into immoveable Principles, or absolutely Certain Grounds, by an Opinion onely sprung from the conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed difficulty in making out those Grounds to be <hi>Impossible to be False;</hi> which yet themselves to a man profess and hold, as they are <hi>Christians.</hi> I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg leave to propose to them these few Considerations: First, 'Tis Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Faith is no less Faith, or an Assent upon Authority, though that Authority be demonstrated to be Infallible: but on the contrary, that 'tis both <hi>firmer</hi> and <hi>more rational</hi> even for that very regard. Secondly, 'Tis Certain that the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Christians <hi>hold</hi> their Faith to be
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59230:91"/>
                  <hi>True,</hi> or Impossible to be False, (that is, 'tis <hi>True to us)</hi> and withall perfectly Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, and consequently that its Grounds or Principles are so able to ascertain it that they place it beyond Possibility of Falshood. Thirdly, 'Tis no less evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that, an inclination or motion of the Will, being of such a nature that it can have neither Truth nor Falshood in it, can be no Rational Principle or Ground of our Assents or Acts of Faith; that is, apt to ascertain them, or indeed apt to establish the <hi>Truth</hi> of any Tenet. Fourthly, That 'tis most evident from my foregoing Discourse, that an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent pious disposition of the Will is still requisite to Faith, notwithstanding the perfect Conclusiveness of the Grounds on which 'tis built; and, that all Acts of Faith depend on this <hi>quoad exercitium</hi> at least, (as the Schools speak) which in the Judgment of many Divines is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Fifthly, That 'tis the common Opinion of the solidest Divines, that <hi>Faith consists with Evidence in the Attester.</hi> Sixthly, That Faith or a firm and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Assent upon Authority, is not <hi>thoroughly rational,</hi> and by consequence <hi>partly faulty,</hi> if the Motives be not <hi>alone</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:59230:92"/>
able to convince an Understanding rightly dispos'd, without the <hi>Will's</hi> Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for, what can be said for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Assent which is <hi>beyond</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive or Reason? Is it not evident from the very Terms that 'tis <hi>Irrational</hi> or <hi>without any Reason?</hi> But, the worst is, that, whereas all good Christians hold their Faith <hi>Impossible to be False,</hi> or judge their Acts of Faith <hi>Immoveable</hi> Assents, these Authors as Speculaters put all the Reasons for Faith to leave it still <hi>Possible to be False,</hi> and make this <hi>pious Affection</hi> the onely thing which elevates it to <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of Falshood,</hi> which is <hi>vastly higher</hi> in point of <hi>Certainty;</hi> as if a rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Creature, not deviating totally from its nature, but acting according to right Reason, ought <hi>therefore</hi> to hold a Point <hi>Impossible to be False,</hi> because it self has an <hi>Affection,</hi> or (as we say) a <hi>great mind</hi> it should be so. Seventhly, This Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion renders the Impossibility of Faith's Falshood, not only <hi>unmaintainable,</hi> (as hath been now shown) but also <hi>unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadable</hi> to others; for, how shall I be able to give account to others that my <hi>Affection</hi> which works this <hi>Perswasion</hi> in me is <hi>rational,</hi> and not apt to mislead me,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59230:92"/>
when as the very Position obliges me to profess the contrary, and to grant that this Affection pushes forward my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to assent <hi>beyond the reason it has,</hi> that is, <hi>as to this degree in my Assent,</hi> (which is no small one since it raises it from judging Faith possible to be false, to judge it Impossible to be such) <hi>without reason?</hi> Or, will not this Speculative Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net seem to force this Inference, that the Grounds of Faith, as to its most intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal consideration, viz. the Impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its Falshood, is made by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin full as dark a hole as 'tis to alledge <hi>the private Spirit?</hi> Nor can the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence due to the Divine Authority suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for such an Effect; both, because 'tis Impossible God should will that <hi>Mankind</hi> for his sake should act <hi>irrationally;</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, because there is no poison in the world so pestilent as an Errour abetted by the most Sacred Patronage of God's Authority, as the Histories of the Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks in all ages, and our home-bred ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience testifies. Whence, that very Reverence to the Divine Authority ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to be so <hi>sure</hi> 'tis engag'd for a Truth e're we admit it for such, that we may securely though with an humble
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59230:93"/>
truth say with <hi>Richardus de Sancto Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, Domine, si error est quod credimus, à te decepti sumus;</hi> so that there is indeed no greater injury and abuse to the Divine Name imaginable, than to hazard the making it patronize <hi>Falshoods:</hi> against this deceit our Saviour hath fore-arm'd us, by his fore-warning us with a <hi>Nolite credere,</hi> when any one pretends, <hi>Loe here is Christ,</hi> or <hi>there is Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, 'tis visible to any indifferent understanding, that those Divines who defend this influence of the <hi>pious Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> upon the settling of Faith's Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though in other Points very rational and acute, yet when they come to this, they are at an utter loss, and can make nothing cohere. <hi>Philippus de Sancta Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate</hi> contradicts himself twice or thrice in one leaf while he attempts to defend it. But, I instance in one for all, that is, Father <hi>Vincentius Baronius,</hi> a Doctour of <hi>Tholouse,</hi> and of the Holy Order of S. <hi>Dominick;</hi> a Person of as much Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, Gravity and Learning as any of late dayes. This Great Writer in his <hi>Manuductio ad Moralem Theologiam,</hi> p. 130, 131. falls upon <hi>Caramuel</hi> in these words, <hi>Distinguit Caramuel duplicem ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestatis
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59230:93"/>
Certitudinem seu veritatem; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malem unam vocat, alteram objectivam; istam negat cuilibet opinioni probabili, ill am concedit,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>Sed hoc nobis ignorantiae prodiglum est aut temeritatis, dari verita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem aut falsitatem, certitudinemque cui nulla Objectiva correspondeat; Hoc ne deo qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem concessum est, ut Scientiam habeat rei non scibilis,</hi> i. e. <hi>veritatem formalem rei quae objectivâ careat.</hi> Yet the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, p. 271 is forc't, by the defence of this ill grounded Tenet which he had espous'd, into the same paralogysm which he had so gravely, severely and learnedly reprehended in another. Where putting the Objection very home, he asks, <hi>Si praevium illud ad Fidem Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium sit intra probabilitatis fines, quâ ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione poterit mens assurgere in assensum illo seu opinione firmiorem? ergo fidei Certitudo nutlat si ab illo Iudicio, quod prudenter probabile dixi, pendeat, nec ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unde repetatur:</hi> This done acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>tota Controversia &amp; fidei summa</hi> is contain'd (as indeed it is) in this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he addresses himself to answer it. First sleightly by an example, that this precedent Judgment is to Faith as Accidental Alteration to the Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59230:94"/>
Form, and so being onely a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to it may be less noble or Certain than Faith is it self; whereas, if our Assent of faith ought to be thoroughly rational, this previous Judgment being that on which this Assent is built, <hi>as to us</hi> or <hi>as to our knowledg,</hi> must at least be <hi>Firm</hi> and <hi>Immovable</hi> it self, since the Assent of Faith built on it ought to be <hi>such,</hi> and consequently beyond Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; whence the example is most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitable; signifying that as Nature dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses matter by imperfect degrees to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a perfect and ultimate Effect, so <hi>infirm Principles</hi> may rationally beget a <hi>firm Assent.</hi> After this, he alledges that <hi>the Certainty of Faith is to be fetch't from God the Authour of it, who infuses Light and gives most efficacious strength to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</hi> But the question is whether God ordinarily and abstracting from Miracle infuses Light into <hi>rational</hi> Creatures, but by means of motives or reasons; and whether it requires such <hi>strength,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be not an unwise Credulousness, that is a great <hi>weakness,</hi> to beleeve be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what we have reason to do, and so unworthy God the giver of every good and perfect gift. Lastly, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms

               <p n="3">3.

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. It follows immediately, that those pretended Faithfull, who have not Grounds of Faith thus qualify'd, have no true Faith; that is, no Act of <hi>Belief,</hi> but what, notwithstanding all that they know, or can know of it, <hi>may possibly be

               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="7">7. 'Tis necessarily consequent from
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:59230:100"/>
the foregoing Paragraphs, that, if I have discours'd right in this small Treatise of mine, and have prov'd that Faith, and, consequently its Grounds, must be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be False; then Mr. <hi>Tillotson</hi>'s Confession p. 118. (to which M. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi>'s Doctrin is consonant) that <hi>[It is Possible to be otherwise</hi> (that is, to be <hi>False) that any Book is so antient as it pretends to be, or that it was written by him whose name it bears, or that this is the sense of such and such passages in it]</hi> is a clear Conviction that neither is the <hi>Book-Rule</hi> he maintains the True Rule of Faith, (§ 3.) nor have he and his Friends <hi>True Faith,</hi> (§ 4.) and, consequently, there being no other Rule owned (taking away <hi>Private Spirit)</hi> but <hi>Tradition,</hi> that <hi>Tradition</hi> is the <hi>onely-true-Rule of Faith,</hi> (§ 6.) and, so, the main of <hi>Sure-Footing</hi> stands yet firm; and, lastly, 'tis evinc'd, that his own Book which opposes it, opposes the <hi>onety-true,</hi> (because the <hi>onely-impossible-to-be-False)</hi> Ground of Faith: that is, he is convinc't in that Supposition, to go about to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all Christian Faith: Whence the Title of his Probable-natur'd Book is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested to be an improper <note n="*" place="margin">Rule of Faith.</note> Nick-name, and the Book it self <hi>to merit no Reply.</hi>

                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:59230:101"/>
8. This last point is hence farther confirm'd because Mr <hi>T.</hi> (and Mr. <hi>St.)</hi> can claim no admittance into a dispute whether this or the other be the True Rule of Faith, till they approve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be <hi>Christians</hi> and show they hold there is such a thing as <hi>Faith,</hi> or that it can bear <hi>the having any Rule</hi> at all; since an Assent to a point seen and acknowledg'd <hi>Possible to to be False,</hi> can never rise to be more than an <hi>Opinion;</hi> nor can the Motive of assenting to what may possibly be False, in true speech be call'd <hi>The Rule of Faith;</hi> both, because there is in that case <hi>no Faith,</hi> (Infer. 1.) and, so, it cannot be a Rule to what <hi>is not;</hi> as also, because what we see <hi>Possible to be False,</hi> cannot with any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety be cal'd a Rule to the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directing it to Truth, in regard, for any thing it sees, 'tis a <hi>crooked path</hi> and a <hi>False Light</hi> leading it into Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. What therefore they are to do, in the circumstances they have brought themselves into, is, to show that they destroy not the <hi>Truth</hi> of Faith, that is, the <hi>Nature</hi> of Faith it self, and the Nature of the <hi>Way</hi> to that Truth or the <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith, by putting them both

                  <hi>possible to be False.</hi> I saw they did; and therefore was oblig'd to begin my discourse higher, and to <hi>Settle</hi> the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence</hi> of Faith by removing the <hi>possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ty of it's Falshood;</hi> that, so, it might be shown able to bear the having a Rule; which, while it was in the tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and uncertain condition to which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and Mr. <hi>St.</hi> had reduc't it, that is, in a Possibility of being all a Ly, and indeed is an Actuality of being as to us <hi>not-Truth,</hi> but at most a great <hi>Likelihood,</hi> it was utterly incapable of. Since therefore in the right method of discoursing <hi>An est</hi> ought to antecede <hi>Quid ests</hi> they have lost their right to be discours't with about the <hi>Quid est</hi> of the Rule of Faith, or <hi>what is that Rule,</hi> till they can justify themselves not to have destroy'd the very <hi>An est</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence</hi> of <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> both, with which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is now challeng'd from his own words, and Mr. <hi>St.</hi> from his abetting him and espousing his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage. Both Nature, therefore, and Art excuse me from replying to Mr <hi>T.</hi> and Mr. <hi>St.</hi> where the just Laws of severe and rigorous Reason exactly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seru'd; and, so, 'tis onely a voluntary

Courtesy not an obligatory duty to afford them or any other Writers thus Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled any Answer at all, or to admit them to a dispute about this Point, <hi>What is the Rule of Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, hence is inferr'd that a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive Method or short way of ending all Controversies between the Catho lik Church and all her relinquishers, is settled by this Doctrin. For, if right Faith must be <hi>Impossible to be False to us,</hi> or to the Generality of Christians, that is, if the Motives to embrace Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, must be <hi>thus firm;</hi> then 'tis E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that that Party whose Writers renounce the having any such Motives, in case those writers speak the sense of that Party, is not rightly <hi>Christian</hi> or truly <hi>Faithfull,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Infer. 4</note> but a <hi>distinct Sect</hi> from the body of right Christians: or, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most unjust that the discourses of private Speculaters should be pinn'd upon the whole party, if they write things deniable by that party; in case any such Party should think fit to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim such Writers as private discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers and their Tenet of Christian Faith's not being <hi>Absolutely Certain,</hi> which they are at liberty to do, and set some
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59230:102"/>
other writers to maintain the opposit Thesis, it will quickly be seen whether they are able to bring <hi>Infallible</hi> Grounds of Faith, I mean any Authority con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying Christ's Faith down to us <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly</hi> (which they must bring <note n="*" place="margin">Infer. 2.</note> if they will prove Faith Impossible to be False) distinct from what the Catholik Church holds to, and which themselves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't when they forsook her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. But that there are, any such Grounds as these, that is Grounds <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>errably</hi> bringing down the Knowledg of Christs Faith to us, that is a, Rule of Faith <hi>Impossible to be False to us,</hi> I could never yet discern by the carriage, writings or Discourse of any Party that dissented from the Catholick Church, to be their Tenet: If, then, it be a most Certain Truth, that Faith must be <hi>Impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be false,</hi> as, I hope, I have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly concluded; 'tis, also, most Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that those who deny they have <hi>such a Faith,</hi> do, by that very denyal, confess they have no <hi>True Faith,</hi> nor are <hi>truly Faithfull,</hi> nor of the <hi>True Catholick Church.</hi>

               <hi>professing</hi> it to be <hi>such:</hi> This found, and duly reflected on, the next thing to be done is, that they press their Learned men, by whom they are led, to shew them by such Grounds as their separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Catholick Church permits them to hold, that is, by <hi>their</hi> Grounds, that Christian Faith is <hi>Impossible to be False;</hi> If they can; (as hitherto they have told us <hi>they cannot)</hi> then their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents may in reason hope well of their own condition till they see those attempts evidently shown invalid.

Grace himself ever instill'd into Mankind.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I beseech thee to obtain for me if thou canst, that, if any think fit to reply to this Treatise, they would be perswaded to set aside all WITTY PREVARI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATION and ELEGANT DROLLERY, (the two chief, and in a manner onely, Sticklers in the pretended Answer to <hi>Sure-Footing)</hi> and, beginning with <hi>First Principles,</hi> to draw thence <hi>Immediate Consequences,</hi> as I have constantly endeavour'd in this Discourse. By their attempting or neglecting to do this, and onely by <hi>that</hi> Test, it will be seen whether my <hi>Evictions</hi> stand or fall; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as from flashy wit so little is gain'd, that even what's solid suffers disgrace by such a mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery. And, I here very penitent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:59230:105"/>
beg pardon of my Readers that I have sometimes heretofore spent my precious time and less<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful labour which might have been better employd, in pursuing that way of Folly. For such my more deliberate Thoughts now discover it, however the reputed profoundness, but, indeed, real shallowness of my Adversaries, made it at that season seem most convenient.</p>
