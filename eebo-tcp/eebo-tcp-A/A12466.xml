            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>IRGINIA</hi> is a Country in <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> that lyeth betweene the degrees of 34 and 44 of the north latitude. <note place="margin">The latitude.</note> The bounds thereof on the East side are the great <hi>Ocean.</hi> On the South lyeth <hi>Florida:</hi> on the North <hi>nova Francia.</hi> As for the West thereof, the limits are vnknowne. Of all this country wee purpose not to speake, but only of that part which was planted by the English men in the yeare of our Lord, 1606. <hi>And this is vnder the degrees 37. 38. and</hi> 39. The temperature of this countrie doth agree well with English constitutions being once seasoned to the country. Which appeared by this, that though by many occasions our people fell sicke; yet did they recover by very small meanes &amp; continued in health, though there were other great causes, not only to haue made them sicke, but even to end their daies, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The sommer is hot as in <hi>Spaine;</hi> the winter colde as in <note place="margin">The te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perature.</note> 
                     <hi>Fraunce</hi> or <hi>England.</hi> The heat of sommer is in Iune, Iulie, and August, but commonly the coole Breefes asswage the vehemencie of the heat. The chiefe of winter is halfe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, Ianuary; February, and halfe March. The colde is extreame sharpe, but here the proverbe is true that <hi>no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame long continueth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the yeare 1607. was an extraordinary frost in most of <hi>Europe,</hi> and this frost was founde as extreame in <hi>Uirginia.</hi> But the next yeare for 8. or 10. daies of ill weather, other 14 daies would be as Sommer.</p>
                  <p>The windes here are variable, but the like thunder and <note place="margin">The windes.</note> lightning to purifie the aire, I haue seldome either seene or

heard in <hi>Europe.</hi> From the Southwest came the greatest gustes with thunder and heat. The Northwest winde is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly coole and bringeth faire weather with it. From the North is the greatest cold, and from the East and South-East as from the <hi>Barmadas,</hi> fogs and raines.</p>
                  <p>Some times there are great droughts other times much raine, yet great necessity of neither, by reason we see not but that all the variety of needfull fruits in <hi>Europe</hi> may be there in great plenty by the industry of men, as appeareth by those we there planted.</p>
                  <p>There is but one entraunce by sea into this country and <note place="margin">The entrances.</note> that is at the mouth of a very goodly Bay the widenesse whereof is neare 18. or 20. miles. The cape on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side is called <hi>Ccpe Henry</hi> in honour of our most noble <note place="margin">Cape Henry.</note> Prince. The shew of the land there is a white hilly sand like vnto the Downes, and along the shores great plentie of Pines and Firres.</p>
                  <p>The north <hi>Cape</hi> is called <hi>Cape Charles</hi> in honour of the <note place="margin">Cape Charles.</note> worthy Duke of <hi>Yorke.</hi> Within is a country that may haue the prerogatiue over the most pleasant places of <hi>Europe, A<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> for large and pleasant navigable rivers, heaven &amp; earth never agreed better to frame a place for mans habitation being of our constitutions, were it ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manured and inhabited by industrious people. here are mountaines, hils, plaines, valleyes, rivers and brookes, all <note place="margin">The country.</note> running most pleasantly into a faire Bay co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passed but for the mouth with fruitfull and delightsome land. In the Bay and rivers are many Isles both great and small, some woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, some plaine, most of them low and not inhabited. This Bay lieth North and South in which the water floweth neare 200 miles &amp; hath a channell for 140 miles, of depth betwixt 7 and 15 fadome, holding in breadth for the most part 10 or 14 miles. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the head of the Bay at the north, the land is mountanous, &amp; so in a manner from thence by a Southwest line; So that the more Southward, the farther of from the Bay are those mounetaines. From which fall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:22714:7"/>
certaine brookes which after come to fiue principall navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable rivers. These run from the Northwest into the South east, and so into the west side of the Bay, where the fall of every River is within 20 or 15 miles one of another.</p>
                  <p>The mountaines are of diverse natures for at the head of <note place="margin">The mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taines.</note> the Bay the rockes are of a composition like milnstones. Some of marble, &amp;c. And many peeces of christall we fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d as throwne downe by water from the mountaines. For in winter these mountaines are covered with much snow, &amp; when it dissolveth the waters fall with such violence, that it causeth great inundations in the narrow valleyes which yet is scarce perceived being once in the rivers. These wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wash from the rocks such glistering tinctures that the ground in some places seemeth as guilded, where both the rocks and the earth are so splendent to behold, <hi>that better iudgements then ours might haue beene perswaded, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained more then probabilities.</hi> The vesture of the earth in most places doeth manifestly proue the nature of the soile to be lusty and very rich. The colour of the earth we found <note place="margin">The soile.</note> in diverse places, resembleth <hi>bole Armoniac, terra sigillata ad lemnia,</hi> Fullers earth marle and divers other such appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances. But generally for the most part the earth is a black sandy mould, in some places a fat slimy clay, in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a very barren gravelli. But the best ground is knowne by the vesture it beareth, as by the greatnesse of trees or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of weedes, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The country is not mountanous nor yet low but such <note place="margin">The vallyes.</note> pleasant plaine hils &amp; fertle valleyes, one prettily crossing an other, and watered so conveniently with their sweete brookes and christall springs, as if art it selfe had devised them. By the rivers are many plaine marishes containing <note place="margin">Plaines.</note> some 20 some 100 some 200 Acres, some more, some lesse. Other plaines there are fewe, but only where the <hi>Savages</hi> inhabit: but all overgrowne with trees and weedes being a plaine wildernes as God first made it.</p>
                  <p>On the west side of the Bay, wee said were 5. faire and

delightfull <hi>navigable</hi> rivers, of which wee will nowe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to report. The first of those rivers and the next to the mouth of the Bay hath his course from the West and by North. The name of this river they call <hi>Powhatan</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">The river Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hatan.</note> the name of a principall country that lieth vpon it. The mouth of this river is neere three miles in breadth, <hi>yet doe the shoules force the Channell so neere the land that a Sacre will overshoot it at point blanck. This river is navigable 100 miles, the shouldes and soundings are here needlesse to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</hi> It falleth from Rockes farre west in a country inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by a nation that they call <hi>Monacan.</hi> But where it commeth into our discoverie it is <hi>Powhatan.</hi> In the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest place that was diligently observed, are falles, rockes, showles, &amp;c. which makes it past navigation <hi>any higher.</hi> Thence in the running downeward, the river is enriched with many goodly brookes, which are maintained by an infinit number of smal rundles and pleasant springs that di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sperse themselues for best service, as doe the vaines of a mans body. From the South there fals into this river. First <note place="margin">The branches.</note> the pleasant river of <hi>Apamatuck.</hi> next more to the East are the two rivers of <hi>Quiyoughcohanocke.</hi> A little farther is a Bay wherein falleth 3 or 4 prettie brookes &amp; creekes that halfe intrench the Inhabitants of <hi>Warraskoyac</hi> then the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Nandsamund,</hi> and lastly the brooke of <hi>Chisapeack.</hi> From the North side is the river of <hi>Chickahamania,</hi> the backe river of <hi>Iames</hi> Towne; another by the <hi>Cedar Isle,</hi> where we lived 10 weekes vpon oisters, then a convenient harbour for fisher boats or smal boats at <hi>Kecoughtan,</hi> that so conveniently turneth it selfe into <hi>Bayes</hi> and Creeks that make that place very pleasant to inhabit, their cornefields being girded therein in a manner as <hi>Peninsulaes.</hi> The most of these rivers are inhabited by severall nations, or rather families. Of the name of the rivers. They haue also in every of those places some Gouernour, as their king, which they call <hi>Werowances.</hi> In a <hi>Peninsula</hi> on the North side of this <note place="margin">Iames Towne.</note> river are the English planted in a place by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called <hi>Iames</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The first and next the rivers mouth are the <hi>Kecoughtans,</hi>

There was once taken 52 Sturgeons at a draught, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draught 68. From the later end of May till the end of Iune are taken few, but yong Sturgeons of 2 foot or a yard long. From thence till the midst of September, them of 2 or three yards long and fewe others. And in 4 or 5 houres with one nette were ordinarily taken 7 or 8: often more, seldome lesse. In the small rivers all the yeare there is good plentie of small fish, so that with hookes those that would take paines had sufficient.</p>

The wood that is most common is Oke and Walnut, <note place="margin">Weeds with their fruits.</note> many of their Okes are so tall and straight, that they will beare two foote and a halfe square of good timber for 20 yards long; Of this wood there is 2 or 3 seuerall kinds. The Acornes of one kind, whose barke is more white, then the other, is somewhat sweetish, which being boyled halfe a day in severall waters, at last afford a sweete oyle, which they keep in goards to annoint their heads and ioints. The fruit they eate made in bread or otherwise. There is also some Elme, some black walnut tree, and some Ash: of Ash <note place="margin">Elme.</note> and Elme they make sope Ashes. If the trees be very great, the ashes will be good, and melt to hard lumps, but if they be small, it will be but powder, and not so good as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Of walnuts there is 2 or 3 kindes; there is a kinde of <note place="margin">Walnuts.

some neere 3 fadome about at the root very straight, and 50, 60, or 80 foot without a braunch. By the dwelling of the <hi>Savages</hi> are some great Mulbery trees, and in some parts of the Countrey, they are found growing naturally <note place="margin">Mulberies.</note> in prettie groues. There was an assay made to make silke, &amp; and surely the wormes prospered excellent well, till the master workeman fell sicke. During which time they were eaten with rats.</p>
                     <p>In some parts were found some Chesnuts whose wild fruit <note place="margin">Chesnuts.</note> equalize the best in <hi>France, Spaine, Germany,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> to their tasts that had tasted them all.

                     <p>They haue Cherries and those are much like a Damsen, <note place="margin">Cherries.</note> but for their tastes and colour we called them Cherries. we see some few Crabs, but very small and bitter.

In winter there are great plenty of Swans, Craynes, gray and white with blacke wings, Herons, Geese, Brants, Ducke, Wigeon, Dotterell, Oxeies, Parrats and Pigeons. Of all those sorts great abundance, and some other strange kinds to vs vnknowne by name. But in sommer not any or a very few to be seene.</p>

Only this is certaine, that many regions lying in the same latitude, afford mines very rich of diuerse natures. The crust also of these rockes would easily perswade a man to beleeue there are other mines then yron and steele, if there were but meanes and men of experience that knew the mine from <hi>spare.</hi>

                     <p>They diuide the yeare into 5. seasons. Their winter some call <hi>Popanow,</hi> the spring <hi>Cattapeuk,</hi> the sommer <hi>Cohatta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yough,</hi>

Then haue they plenty of fruits as well planted as naturall, as corne, greene and ripe, fish, fowle, and wilde beastes exceeding fat.</p>
                     <p>The greatest labour they take, is in planting their corne, for the country naturally is ouergrowne with wood. To <note place="margin">How they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the ground</note> prepare the ground they bruise the barke of the trees neare the root, then do they scortch the roots with fire that they grow no more. The next yeare with a crooked peece of wood, they beat vp the woodes by the rootes, and in that moulds they plant their corne. Their manner is this. They make a hole in the earth with a sticke, and into it they put 4 graines of wheate, and 2 of beanes. These holes they make 4 foote one from another; Their women and childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do continually keepe it with weeding, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is growne midle high, they hill it about like a hop-yard.</p>
                     <p>In Aprill they begin to plant, but their chiefe plantatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in May, and so they continue till the midst of Iune. What <note place="margin">How they plant</note> they plant in Aprill they reape in August, for May in Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, for Iune in October; Every stalke of their corne commonly beareth two eares, some 3, seldome any 4, many but one &amp; some none. Every eare ordinarily hath betwixt 200 and 500 graines. The stalke being green hath a sweet iuice in it, somewhat like a suger Cane, which is the cause that when they gather their corne greene, they sucke the stalkes: for as wee gather greene pease so doe they their corne being greene, which excelleth their old. They plant also pease they cal <hi>Assetamens,</hi> which are the same they cal in <hi>Italy', Fagioli.</hi> Their Beanes are the same the Turkes cal <hi>Garnanses,</hi> but these they much esteeme for dainties.</p>

Their corne they rost in the eare greene, and bruising it in a morter of wood with a Polt, lappe it in rowles in the <note place="margin">How they vse their corne.</note> leaues of their corne, and so boyle it for a daintie. They also reserue that corne late planted that will not ripe, by toasting it in hot ashes, the heat thereof drying it. In win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they esteeme it being boyled with beans for a rare dish, they call <hi>Pausarowmena.</hi> Their old wheat they first steep a night in hot water, in the morning pounding it in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They vse a small basket for their Temmes, then pound againe the great, and so separating by dashing their hand in the basket, receaue the flower in a platter made of wood scraped to that forme with burning and shels. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering this flower with water, they make it either in cakes couering them with ashes till they bee baked, and then washing them in faire water they drie presently with their owne heat: or else boyle them in water eating the broth with the bread which they call <hi>Ponap.</hi> The grouts and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the cornes remaining, by fanning in a Platter or in the wind, away, the branne they boile 3 or 4 houres with water, which is an ordinary food they call <hi>Ustatahamen.</hi> But some more thrifty then cleanly, doe burne the core of the eare to powder which they call <hi>Pungnough,</hi> mingling that in their meale, but it never tasted well in bread, nor broth. Their fish and flesh they boyle either very tenderly, <note place="margin">How they vse their fish and flesh.</note> or broyle it so long on hurdles over the fire, or else after the <hi>Spanish</hi> fashion, putting it on a spit, they turne first the one side, then the other, til it be as drie as their ierkin beefe in the west <hi>Indies,</hi> that they may keepe it a month or more without putrifying. The broth of fish or flesh they eate as commonly as the meat.</p>
                     <p>In May also amongst their corne they plant Pumpeons, <note place="margin">Planted fruits.</note> and a fruit like vnto a muske millen, but lesse and worse, which they call <hi>Macocks.</hi> These increase exceedingly, &amp; ripen in the beginning of Iuly, and continue vntil Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:22714:15"/>
and continue till the end of October. When all their fruits be gathered, little els they plant, &amp; this is done by their women and children; neither doth this long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice them, for neere 3 parts of the yeare, they only obserue times and seasons, and liue of what the Country naturally affordeth from hand to mouth, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>The land is not populous, for the men be fewe; their far greater number is of women &amp; children. Within 60 miles of <hi>Iames</hi> Towne there are about some 5000 people, but of able men fit for their warres scarse 1500. To nourish so <note place="margin">The numbers.</note> many together they haue yet no means because they make so smal a benefit of their land, be it never so fertill. 6 or 700 <note place="margin">700 men were the most were seene together whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they thoght to haue surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Captaine Smith.

As small as the proportion of ground that hath yet beene discovered, is in comparison of that yet vnknowne. The people differ very much in stature, especially in lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as before is expressed. Some being very great as the <hi>Sesquesahamocks;</hi> others very little, as the <hi>Wighcocomocoes:</hi> but generally tall and straight, of a comely proportion, &amp; of a colour browne when they are of any age, but they are borne white. Their haire is generally black, but few haue any beards. The men weare halfe their heads shaven, the <note place="margin">The barbers.</note> other halfe long; for Barbers they vse their women, who with 2 shels will grate away the haire, of any fashion they please. The women are cut in many fashions agreeable to their yeares, but ever some part remaineth long. They are <note place="margin">The constitution</note> very strong, of an able body and full of agilitie, able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to lie in the woods vnder a tree by the fire, in the worst of winter, or in the weedes and grasse, in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buscado</hi> in the Sommer. They are inconstant in everie <note place="margin">The disposition.</note> thing, but what feare constraineth them to keepe. Craftie,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:22714:16"/>
timerous, quicke of apprehensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; very ingenuous. Some are of disposition fearefull, some bold, most cautelous, all <hi>Savage.</hi> Generally covetous of coppeer, beads, &amp; such like trash. They are soone moved to anger, and so malitious, that they seldome forget an iniury: they seldome steale one from another, least their coniurers should reueale it, and so they be pursued and punished. That they are thus feared is certaine, but that any can reueale their offences by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuration I am doubtfull. Their women are carefull not to bee suspected of dishonesty without the leaue of their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. Each houshold knoweth their owne lands &amp; gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and most liue of their owne labours. For their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, <note place="margin">The possessions</note> they are some time couered with the skinnes of wilde beasts, which in winter are dressed with the haire, but in sommer without. The better sort vse large ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tels of deare <note place="margin">Their attire.</note> skins not much differing in fashion fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Irish mantels. Some imbrodered with white beads, some with copper, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther painted after their manner. But the common sort haue scarce to cover their nakednesse but with grasse, the leaues of trees, or such like. We haue seen some vse mantels made of Turky feathers, so prettily wrought and wouen with threeds that nothing could bee discerned but the feathers. That was exceeding warme and very handsome. But the women are alwaies couered about their midles with a skin and very shamefast to be seene bare. They adorne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues most with copper beads and paintings. Their women some <note place="margin">Their orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</note> haue their legs, hands, brests and face cunningly imbrode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with diuerse workes, as beasts, serpentes, artificially wrought into their flesh with blacke spots. In each eare commonly they haue 3 great holes, whereat they hange chaines bracelets or copper. Some of their men weare in those holes, a smal greene &amp; yellow coloured snake, neare halfe a yard in length, which crawling &amp; lapping her selfe about his necke often times familiarly would kisse his lips. Others wear a dead Rat tied by the tail. So<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e on their heads weare the wing of a bird, or some large feather with a Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:22714:16"/>
Those Rattels are somewhat like the chape of a Rapier but lesse, which they take from the taile of a snake. Many haue the whole skinne of a hawke or some strange sowle, stuffed with the wings abroad. Others a broad peece of copper, and some the hand of their enemy dryed. Their heads and shoulders are painted red with the roote <hi>Bocone</hi> braied to powder mixed with oyle, this they hold in somer to preserue them from the heate, and in winter from the cold. Many other formes of paintings they vse, but he is the most gallant that is the most monstrous to behould.</p>
                     <p>Their buildings &amp; habitations are for the most part by <note place="margin">Their buildings</note> the riuers or not farre distant from some fresh spring. Their houses are built like our Arbors of small young springs bowed and tyed, and so close covered with mats, or the barkes of trees very handsomely, that notwithstanding ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther winde, raine or weather, they are as warme as stooues, but very smoaky, yet at the toppe of the house there is a hole made for the smoake to goe into right over the fire.</p>
                     <p>Against the fire they lie on little hurdles of Reedes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <note place="margin">Their lodgings.</note> with a mat borne from the ground a foote and more by a hurdle of wood. On these round about the house they lie heads and points one by that her against the fire, some covered with mats, some with skins, and some starke naked lie on the ground, from 6 to 20 in a house. Their houses are in the midst of their fields or gardens which are smal plots <note place="margin">Their garden.</note> of ground. Some 20, some 40. some 100. some 200. some more, some lesse, some times from 2 to 100 of those houses togither, or but a little separated by groues of trees. Neere their habitations is little small-wood or old trees on the ground by reason of their burning of them for fire. So that a man may gallop a horse amongst these woods any waie, but where the creekes or Rivers shall hinder.</p>
                     <p>Men women and children haue their severall names ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <note place="margin">How they vse their children.</note> to the seuerall humor of their Parents. Their wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men (they say) are easilie deliuered of childe, yet doe they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22714:17"/>
loue children verie dearly. To make them hardy, in the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest mornings they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wash in the riuers and by painting and ointments so canne their skins, that after a year or two, no weather will hurt them.</p>
                     <p>The men bestowe their times in fishing, hunting, wars &amp; <note place="margin">The industry of their women.</note> such manlike exercises, scorning to be seene in any woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like exercise, which is the cause that the women be verie painefull and the men often idle. The women and children do the rest of the worke. They make mats, baskets, pots, morters, pound their corne, make their bread, prepare their victuals, plant their corne, gather their corne, beare al kind of burdens and such like.</p>
                     <p>Their fire they kindle presently by chasing a dry poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sticke in a hole of a little square peece of wood, that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">How they strike fire.</note> it selfe, will so fire mosse, leaues, or anie such like drie thing, that will quickly burne. In March and Aprill they liue much vpon their fishing, weares, and feed on fish, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies <note place="margin">Their order of diet.</note> and squirrels. In May and Iune they plant their fieldes and liue most of Acornes, walnuts, and fish. But to mend their diet, some disperse themselues in small companies &amp; liue vpon fish, beasts, crabs, oysters, land Torteyses, straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries, mulberries, &amp; such like. In Iune, Iulie, and August they feed vpon the rootes of <hi>Tocknough</hi> berries, fish and greene wheat. It is strange to see how their bodies alter with their diet, euen as the deare and wilde beastes they seeme fat and leane, strong and weak. <hi>Powhatan</hi> their great king and some others that are provident, rost their fish and flesh vpon hurdles as before is expressed, and keepe it till scarce times.</p>
                     <p>For fishing and hunting and warres they vse much their bow and arrowes. They bring their bowes to the forme of <note place="margin">How they make their bowes and arrowes.</note> ours by the scraping of a shell. Their arrowes are made some of straight young sprigs which they head with bone, some 2 or 3 inches long. These they vse to shoot at squir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels on trees. An other sort of arrowes they vse made of reeds. These are peeced with wood, headed with splinters
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:22714:17"/>
of christall or some sharpe stone, the spurres of a Turkey, or the bill of some bird. For his knife he hath the splinter <note place="margin">Their kniues.</note> of a reed to cut his feathers in forme. With this knife also, he will ioint a Deare or any beast, shape his shooes, bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, mantels, &amp;c. To make the noch of his arrow hee hath the tooth of a Beuer, set in a sticke, wherewith he grateth it by degrees, His arrow head he quickly maketh with a little bone, which he ever weareth at his bracer, of any splint of a stone, or glasse in the forme of a hart and these they glew to the end of their arrowes. With the sinewes of Deare, and the tops of Deares hornes boiled to a ielly, they make a glew that will not dissolue in cold water.</p>
                     <p>For their wars also they vse Targets that are round and <note place="margin">Their Targets and Swords.</note> made of the barkes of trees, and a sworde of wood at their backs, but oftentimes they vse for swords the horne of a Deare put through a peece of wood in forme of a Pickaxe. Some a long stone sharpned at both ends vsed in the same manner. This they were wont to vse also for hatchets, but now by trucking they haue plenty of the same forme of y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. And those are their chiefe instruments and armes.</p>
                     <p>Their fishing is much in Boats. These they make of one <note place="margin">Their boats.</note> tree by bowing &amp; scratching away the coles with stons &amp; shels till they haue made it in forme of a Trough. Some of them are an elne deepe, and 40 or 50 foot in length, and some will beare 40 men, but the most ordinary are smaller and will beare 10, 20, or 30. according to their bignes. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of oares, they vse paddles and sticks with which they will row faster then our Barges. Betwixt their hands and thighes, their women vse to spin, the barks of trees, deare <note place="margin">How they spin.</note> sinews, or a kind of grasse they call <hi>Pemmenaw,</hi> of these they make a thred very even &amp; readily. This thred serveth for many vses. As about their housing, apparell, as also they make nets for fishing, for the quantity as formally braded as ours. They make also with it lines for angles. Their <note place="margin">Their fishooker.</note> hookes are either a bone grated as they nock, their arrows in the forme of a crooked pinne or fishook or, of the splin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:22714:18"/>
of a bone tied to the clift of a litle stick, and with the ende of the line, they tie on the bate. They vse also long arrowes tyed in a line wherewith they shoote at fish in the rivers. But they of <hi>Accawmack</hi> vse staues like vnto Iave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins headed with bone. With these they dart fish swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the water. They haue also many artificiall weares in which they get abundance of fish.</p>
                     <p>In their hunting and fishing they take extreame paines; yet it being their ordinary exercise from their infancy, they esteeme it a pleasure and are very proud to be expert there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And by their continuall ranging, and travel, they know all the advantages and places most frequented with Deare, Beasts, Fish, Foule, Rootes, and Berries. At their huntings they leaue their habitations, and reduce themselues into companies, as the <hi>Tartars</hi> doe, and goe to the most desert <note place="margin">How they hunt</note> places with their families, where they spend their time in hunting and fowling vp towards the mountaines, by the heads of their riuers, where there is plentie of game. For betwixt the rivers the grounds are so narrowe, that little commeth there which they devoure not. It is a marvel they can so directly passe these deserts, some 3 or 4 daies iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney without habitation. Their hunting houses are like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Arbours couered with mats. These their women beare after them, with Corne, Acornes, Morters, and all bag and baggage they vse. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come to the place of exercise, euery man doth his best to shew his dexteritie, for by their excelling in those quallities, they get their wiues. Forty yards will they shoot leuell, or very neare the mark, and 120 is their best at Random. At their huntings in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts they are commonly 2 or 300 together. Hauing found the Deare, they enuiron them with many fires, and betwixt the fires they place themselues. And some take their stands in the midst. The Deare being thus feared by the fires and their voices, they chace them so long within that circle that many times they kill 6, 8, 10, or 15 at a hunting. They vse also to driue them into some narrowe point of land;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:22714:18"/>
when they find that aduantage and so force them into the riuer, where with their boats they haue <hi>Ambuscadoes</hi> to kill them. When they haue shot a Deare by land, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him like blood hounds by the blood and straine and oftentimes so take them. Hares, Pattridges, Turkies, or Egges, fat or leane, young or old, they devoure all they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> catch in their power. In one of these huntings they found Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> in the discoverie of the head of the river of <hi>Chickahamania,</hi> where they slew his men, and tooke him prisoner in a Bogmire, where he saw those exercises, &amp; ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered these observations.</p>
                     <p>One Savage hunting alone, vseth the skinne of a Deare <note place="margin">One Savage hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting alone.</note> slit on the one side, and so put on his arme, through the neck, so that his hand comes to the head which is stuffed, and the hornes, head, eies, eares, and every part as artefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally counterfeited as they can devise. Thus shrowding his body in the skinne by stalking he approacheth the Deare, creeping on the ground from one tree to another.

These as enimies tooke their stands a musket shot one from another; ranked themselues 15 a breast and each ranke from another 4 or 5 yards, not in fyle, but in the opening betwixt their fyles, So as the Reare could shoot as conueniently as the Front. Hauing thus pit ched the fields: from either part went a Messenger with these conditions, that whosoever were vanquished, such as escape vpon their submission in 2 daies after should liue, but their wiues and children should be prize for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querers. The messengers were no sooner returned, but they approached in their orders; On each flanke a Sarieant, and in the Reare an officer for levitenant, all duly keeping their orders, yet leaping &amp; singing after their accustomed tune which they vse only in warres. Vpon the first flight of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes they gaue such horrible shouts and screeches, as though so many infernall helhounds could not haue made them more terrible. When they had spent their arrowes they ioined together prettily, charging and retiring, every ranke seconding other. As they got advantage they cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched their enimies by the haire of the head, and downe he came that was taken.

returned to their owne quarter. All their actions, voices &amp; gestures, both in charging and retiring were so strained to the hight of their quallitie and nature, that the strangenes thereof made it seem very delightfull.</p>
                     <p>For their musicke they vse a thicke cane, on which they pipe as on a Recorder. For their warres they haue a great <note place="margin">Their Musicke</note> deepe platter of wood.

After this doe 2. or more of their chiefest men make an oration, testifying their loue. Which they do with such vehemency &amp; so great passions, that they sweate till they drop, and are so out of breath they can scarce speake. So that a man would take them to be exceeding angry or starke mad. Such victuall as they haue, they spend freely, &amp; at night where his lodging is appointed, they set a woman fresh painted red with <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cones</hi> and oile, to be his bedfellow.</p>
                     <p>Their manner of trading is for copper, beades, and such like, for which they giue such commodities as they haue, <note place="margin">Their trade.</note> as skins, fowle, fish, flesh, and their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try corne.

                     <p>Every spring they make themselues sicke with drinking the iuice of a root they call <hi>wighsacan,</hi> and water, whereof <note place="margin">Their phisicke.</note> they powre so great a quantity, that it purgeth them in a very violent maner; so that in 3 or 4 daies after they scarce

                     <p>In this place commonly is resident 7 Priests.

The ornaments of the chiefe Priest was certain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires for his head made thus. They tooke a dosen or 16 or

more snake skins and stuffed them with mosse, and of wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and other vermine skins a good many. All these they tie by their tailes, so as all their tailes meete in the toppe of their head, like a great Tassell. Round about this Tassell is as it were a crown of feathers, the skins hang round about his head necke and shoulders and in a manner cover his face. The faces of all their Priests are painted as vgly as they can devise, in their hands they had every one his Rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, some base, some smaller. Their devotion was most in songs which the chiefe Priest beginneth and the rest fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, sometimes he maketh invocations with broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sentences by starts and strange passions, &amp; at every pause, the rest giue a short groane.</p>
                     <p>It could not bee perceiued that they keepe any day as more holy then other; But only in some great distresse of want, feare of enimies, times of triumph and gathering to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither <note place="margin">Their times of solemnities.</note> their fruits, the whole country of men women and children come togither to solemnities. The manner of their devotion is, sometimes to make a great fire, in the house or fields, and all to sing and dance about it with rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and shouts togither, 4 or 5 houres. Sometime they set a man in the midst, and about him they dance and sing, he all the while clapping his hands as if he would keepe time, &amp; after their songs and dauncings ended they goe to their Feasts.</p>
                     <p>They haue also diuers coniurations one they made whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The manner of it was thus. First they made a faire fire in a house; about this fire set 7 Priests setting him by them, and about the fire, they made a circle of meale. That done the chiefe Priest attired as is expressed began to shake his rattle, and the rest followed him in his song. At the end of the song, he laid downe 5 or 3 graines of wheat and so continued counting his songs by the graines, till 3 times they incirculed the fire, then they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:22714:22"/>
the graines by certaine numbers with little stickes, laying downe at the ende of euery song a little sticke. In this manner they sat 8, 10, or 12 houres without cease, with such strange stretching of their armes, &amp; violent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and gestures as might well seeme strange to him they so coniured who but every houre expected his end: not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meat they did eat till late in the evening they had fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed this worke, and then they feasted him and themselues with much mirth, but 3 or 4 daies they continued this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony.</p>
                     <p>They haue also certaine Altar stones they call <hi>Pawco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Their altars.</note> but these stand from their Temples, some by their houses, other in the woodes and wildernesses. Vpon this they offer blood, deare suet, and Tobacco. These they doe when they returne from the warres, from hunting, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many other occasions. They haue also another supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they vse in stormes, when the waters are rough in <note place="margin">Sacrifices to the water.</note> the riuers and sea coasts.

Before their dinners and suppers the better sort will take the first bit, and cast it in the fire, which is all the grace they are known to vse.</p>
                     <p>In some part of the Country they haue yearely a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of children.

Fifteene <note place="margin">Their solemne sacrifices of children.</note> of the properest young boyes, betweene 10 and 15 yeares of age they painted white. Hauing brought them forth the people spent the forenoone in dancing and singing about them with rattles. In the afternoone they put those childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the roote of a tree. By them all the men stood in a guard, every one hauing a Bastinado in his hand, made of reeds bound together. This made a lane betweene them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, through which there were appointed 5 young men
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:22714:22"/>
to fetch these childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: so every one of the fiue we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t through the guard to fetch a child each after other by turnes, the guard fearelesly beating them with their Bastinadoes, and they patiently enduring and receauing all, defending the children with their naked bodies from the vnmercifull blowes that pay them soundly though the children escape. All this while the women weepe and crie out very passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, prouiding mats, skinnes, mosse, and drie wood, as things fitting their childrens funerals. After the children were thus passed the guard, the guard tore down the trees, branches, and boughs, with such violence that they rent the body, and made wreathes for their heads, or bedecked their haire with the leaues. What else was done with the childron, was nonseene, but they were all cast on a heape, in a valley as dead, where they made a great feast for al the company. The <hi>Werowance</hi> being demanded the meaning of this sacrifice, answered that the children were not al dead, but that the <hi>Oke</hi> or <hi>Divell</hi> did sucke the blood from their left breast, who chanced to be his by lot, till they were dead, but the rest were kept in the wildernesse by the yong men till nine moneths were expired, during which time they must not conuerse with any, and of these were made their Priests and Coniurers. This sacrifice they held to bee so necessarie, that if they should omit it, their <hi>Oke</hi> or Divel and all their other <hi>Quiyoughcosughes</hi> which are their other Gods, would let them haue no Deare, Turkies, Corne, nor fish, and yet besides, hee would make a great slaughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them.</p>
                     <p>They thinke that their <hi>Werowances</hi> and Priestes which <note place="margin">Their resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</note> they also esteeme <hi>Quiyoughcosughes,</hi> when they are dead, doe goe beyound the mountaines towardes the setting of the sun, and euer remaine there in forme of their <hi>Oke,</hi> with their heads painted with oile and <hi>Pocones,</hi> finely trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with feathers, and shal haue beades, hatchets, copper, and tobacco, doing nothing but dance and sing, with all their Predecessors. But the common people they suppose
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:22714:23"/>
shall not liue after death.</p>
                     <p>To diuert them from this blind idolatrie, many vsed their best indeauours, chiefly with the <hi>Werowances</hi> of <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>youghcohanock,</hi> whose devotion, apprehension, and good disposition, much exceeded any in those Countries, who though we could not as yet preuaile withall to forsake his false Gods, yet this de did beleeue that our God as much exceeded theirs, as our Gunnes did their Bowes &amp; Arrows and many times did send to the President, at <hi>Iames</hi> towne, men with presents, intreating them to pray to his God for raine, for his Gods would not send him any.

When he dineth or suppeth, one of his women before and after meat, bringeth him water in a woden platter to wash his hands. Another waiteth with a bunch of feathers to wipe them insteed of a Towell, and the feathers when he hath wiped are dryed againe. His kingdome des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:22714:24"/>
not to his sonnes nor children, but first to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whereof he hath 3. namely <hi>Opitchapan, Opechanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">His successors</note> and <hi>Catataugh,</hi> and after their decease to his sisters. First to the eldest sister then to the rest and after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the heires male and female of the eldest sister, but never to the heires of the males.</p>
                     <p>He nor any of his people vnderstand any letters wherby to write or read, only the lawes whereby he ruleth is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome. Yet when he listeth his will is a law and must bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed: not only as a king but as halfe a God they esteeme <note place="margin">Their authority</note> him. His inferiour kings whom they cal <hi>werowances</hi> are ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to rule by customes, and haue power of life &amp; death as their command in that nature. But this word <hi>Werowance</hi> which we call and conster for a king, is a common worde whereby they call all commanders for they haue but fewe words in their language, and but few occasions to vse anie officers more then one commander, which commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly they call <hi>werowances.</hi> They all knowe their severall landes, and <note place="margin">The tenor of their lands.</note> habitations, and limits, to fish, sowle, or hunt in, but they hold all of their great <hi>Werowances Powhatan,</hi> vnto whome they pay tribute of skinnes, beades, copper, pearle, deare, turkies, wild beasts, and corne. What he commandeth they dare not disobey in the least thing. It is strange to see with what great feare and adoration all these people doe obay this <hi>Powhatan.</hi> For at his feet they present whatsoever hee commandeth, and at the least frowne of his browe, their greatest spirits will tremble with feare: and no maruell, for he is very terrible and tyrannous in punishing such as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him. For example hee caused certaine malefactors to be bound hand and foot, then hauing of many fires gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">His maner of punishments.</note> great store of burning coles, they rake these coles rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in the forme of a cockpit, and in the midst they cast the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders to broyle to death. Somtimes he causeth the heads of them that offend him, to be laid vpon the altar or sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing stone, and one with clubbes beates out their braines. When he would punish any notorious enimie or malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:22714:24"/>
he causeth him to be tied to a tree, &amp; with muscle shels or reeds, the executioner outteth of his ioints one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, euer casting what they cut of into the fire; then doth he proceed with shels and reeds to case the skinne from his head and face; then doe they rip his belly and so burne him with the tree and all. Thus themselues reported they exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted <hi>George Cassen.</hi> Their ordinary correction is to beate them with cudgels. Wee haue seene a man kneeling on his knees, and at <hi>Powhatans</hi> command, two men haue beat him on the bare skin, till he hath fallen senselesse in a sound, &amp; yet neuer cry nor complained.</p>
                     <p>In the yeare 1608, hee surprised the people of <hi>Payanka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tank</hi> his neare neighbours and subiects. The occasion was to vs vnknowne, but the manner was thus. First he sent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse of his men as to lodge amongst them that night, then the <hi>Ambuscadoes</hi> inuironed al their houses, &amp; at the houre appointed, they all fell to the spoile, 24 men they slewe, the long haire of the one side of their heades with the skinne cased off with shels or reeds, they brought away. They sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised also the women &amp; the children and the <hi>Werowance.</hi> All these they present to <hi>Powhatan.</hi> The <hi>Werowance,</hi> wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and children became his prisoners, &amp; doe him service. The lockes of haire with their skinnes he hanged on a line vnto two trees. And thus he made oftentation of as great a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph at <hi>Werowocomoco,</hi> shewing them to the Emglish men that then came vnto him at his appointment, they expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting provision, he to betray them, supposed to halfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer them by this spectacle of his terrible crueltie.</p>
                     <p>And this is as much as my memory can call to mind wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thie of note; which I haue purposely collected, to satisfie my friends of the true worth and qualitie of <hi>Virginia.</hi> Yet some bad natures will not sticke to slander the Countrey; that will slovenly spit at all things, especially in company where they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> find none to contradict them. Who though they were scarse euer 10 miles from <hi>Iames</hi> Town, or at the most but at the falles; yet holding it a great disgrace that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:22714:25"/>
amongst so much action, their actions were nothing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime of all things, though they never adventured to knowe any thing; nor euer did any thing but devoure the fruits of other mens labours. Being for most part of such tender educations and small experience in martiall acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, because they found not English cities, nor such faire houses, nor at their owne wishes any of their accustomed dainties, with feather beds and downe pillowes, Tavernes and alehouses in every breathing place, neither such plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of gold and siluer and dissolute liberty as they expected, had little or no care of any thing, but to pamper their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to fly away with our Pinnaces, or procure their means to returne for England. For the Country was to them a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie, a ruine, a death, a hell, and their reports here, &amp; their owne actions there according.</p>
                     <p>Some other there were that had yearely stipends to pass to and againe for transportation: who to keepe the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the businesse in themselues, though they had neither time nor meanes to knowe much of themselues; yet al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s actions or relations they so formally tuned to the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing times simplicitie, as they could make their ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces seeme much more, then al the true actors could by their experience. And those with their great words deluded the world with such strange promises as abused the businesse much worse then the rest. For the businesse being builded vpon the foundation of their fained experience, the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the mony, tinne, and meanes haue still miscaried: yet they ever returning, and the Planters so farre absent, who could contradict their excuses? which stil to maintain their vaineglory and estimation, from time to time they haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed such diligence as made them passe for truthes, though nothing more false. And that the adve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>turers might be thus abused, let no man wonder; for the wisest liuing is soonest abused by him that hath a faire tongue and a dissembling heart.</p>
                     <p>There were many in <hi>Virginia</hi> meerely proiecting, verbal
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:22714:25"/>
and idle contemplatours, and thoseso deuoted to pure idle nesse, that though they had lived two or three yeares in <hi>Virginia,</hi> lordly, necessitie it selfe could not compell them to passe the <hi>Peninsula,</hi> or <hi>Pallisadoes</hi> of <hi>Iames</hi> Towne, and those wittie spirits, what would they not affirme in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of our transporters to get victuall from their ships, or obtaine their good words in <hi>England</hi> to get their passes. Thus from the clamors and the ignorance of false infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, are sprung those disasters that sprung in <hi>Virginia,</hi> and our ingenious verbalists were no lesse plague to vs in <hi>Uir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> then the Locusts to the Egyptians. For the labour of 30 of the best only preserued in Christianitie by their indu strie the idle livers of neare 200 of the rest: who liuing neer 10 months of such naturall meanes, as the Country natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally of it selfe afforded, notwithstanding all this, and the worst furie of the Savages, the extremitie of sicknesse, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies, faction, ignorances, and want of victuall; in all that time I lost but 7 or 8 men, yet subiected the Savages to our desired obedience, and receaued contribution from 35 of their kings, to protect and assist the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> against any that should assalt them, in which order they continued true &amp; faithful, and as subiects to his Maiestie, so long after as I did gouern there, vntill I left the Country: since, how they haue revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Countrie lost, and againe replanted, and the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses hath succeeded from time to time, I referre you to the relations of them returned from <hi>Virginia,</hi> that haue bin more diligent in such observations.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ong hath the world longed, but to be truely satisfied what Virginia is, with the truth of those proceedings, from whence hath flowne so manie reports of worth, &amp; yet few good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the charge, which hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed suspition in many well willers that desire yet but to be truely satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied therein. If any can resolue this doubt it is those that haue lived residents in the land: not salers, or passengers, nor such mercinary contemplators, that only bedeck them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with others plumes. This discourse is not from such, neither am I the author, for they are many, whose particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar discourses are signed by their names. This solid trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, first was compiled by <hi>Richard Pots,</hi> since passing the hands of many to pervse, cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing into my hands, (for that I know them honest men, and can partly well witnesse their relations true) I could do no lesse in charity to the world the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reveale; nor in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science, but approue. By the advise of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny graue and vnderstanding gentlemen, that haue pressed it, to the presse, it was thought fit to publish it, rather in it owne rude phrase then other waies. For that nothing can so purge that famous action from the infamous scandal some ignorantly haue conceited, as the plaine simple and naked truth. For defect whereof the businesse is still suspected, the truth vnknowne, and the best deservers discouraged, and neglected, some by false reports, others by coniecture, and such power hath flattry to ingender of those, hatred and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that one is sufficent to beguile more, then 500 can
<pb facs="tcp:22714:28"/>
keepe from being deceiued.</p>
                  <p>But this discourse is no Iudge of mens manners, nor ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of their former courses; only a reporter of their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Virginia, not to disgrace any, accuse any, excuse any, nor flatter any; for which cause there is no wrong done but this, shortnesse in complaining, &amp; so sparing in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mending as only the reader may perceiue the truth for his paines, &amp; the action purged of foule slander; it can detract from none that intendeth there to adventure their fortunes; and to speake truly of the first planters, that brake the yee &amp; beate the path, howsoeuer many difficulties obscured their inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, he were worse then the worst of Ingrates, that would not spare them memory that haue buried themselues in those forrain regions. From whose first adventures may spring more good blessings then are yet conceived. So I rest thine, that will read, pervse, &amp; vnderstand me. If you finde false orthography or broken English, they are small faultes in souldiers, that not being able to write learnedly, onlie striue to speake truely, and be vnderstood without an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter.</p>

Gentrie, and Marchants, so that his Maiestie by his letters patents, gaue commission for establishing Councels, to direct here, and to governe, and to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute there; to effect this, was spent another yeare, and by that time, three ships were provided, one of 100 Tonns, another of 40. and a Pinnace of 20. The trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of the company was committed to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Christopher Newport,</hi> a Marriner well practised for the westerne parts of <hi>America.</hi> But their orders for gouernement were put in a box, not to be opened, <note place="margin">Orders for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</note> nor the governours knowne vntill they arived in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia.</hi>

                     <p>On the 19 of December, 1606. we set saile, but by vnprosperous winds, were kept six weekes in the sight of England; all which time, <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Hunt</hi> our Preacher, was so weake and sicke, that few expected his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.

But God the guider of all good actions, forcing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by an extream storme to hul all night, did driue them by his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to their desired port, bey ond all their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for never any of them had seene that coast.

but determined by the maior part of the Councell in which the Precedent had 2 voices. Vntill the 13 of May they sought a place to plant in, then the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell was sworne, M. <hi>Wingfeild</hi> was chosen Precident, &amp; an oration made, whie Captaine <hi>Smith</hi> was not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of the Councell as the rest.</p>

The Salvages often visited vs kindly. The Precidents overweening iealousie would admit no exeroise at armes, or fortification, but the boughs of trees cast together in the forme of a halfe moone by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary paines and diligence of Captaine <hi>Kendall, Newport,</hi> with <hi>Smith,</hi> and 20 others, were sent to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover <note place="margin">The discouery of the Falles and Powhatan.</note> the head of the river: by divers smal habitations they passed, in 6 daies they arrived at a towne called <hi>Powhatan,</hi> consisting of some 12 houses pleasantly sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te don a hill; before it 3 fertil Iles, about it many of their cornefields, the place is very pleasant, and strong by nature, of this place the Prince is called <hi>Powhatan,</hi> and his people <hi>Powhatans,</hi> to this place the river is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable, but higher within a mile, by reason of the Rockes and Iles, there is not passage for a smal boate, this they call the Falles, the people in al parts kindly intreated them, til being returned within 20 miles of <hi>Iames</hi> towne, they gaue iust cause of iealousie, but had God not blessed the discoverers otherwise then those at the fort, there had then beene an end of that planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for at the fort, where they arived the next day,

But 30 of vs he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted 5. myles from the fort to learn to make clapbord, cut downe trees, and ly in woods; amongst the rest he had chosen <hi>Gabriell Beadell,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iohn Russell</hi> the only two gallants of this last supply, and both proper gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: strange were these pleasures to their conditions, yet lodging eating, drinking, working, or playing they doing but as the President, all these things were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so pleasantly, as within a weeke they became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, making it their delight to heare the trees thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as they fell, but the axes so oft blistered there ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fingers, that commonly every third blow had a lowd oath to drowne the eccho; for remedy of which sin the President devised howe to haue everie mans oathes numbred, and at night, for every oath to haue a can of water povvred downe his sleeue, vvith <note place="margin">A punishment for swearing.</note> vvhich every offender vvas so vvashed (himselfe &amp; all) that a man should scarse heare an oath in a weeke.</p>

Master <hi>Scrivener,</hi> Captaine <hi>Waldo,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Winne</hi> at the fort, every one in like manner care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully regarded their charge. The President retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from amongst the woodes, seeing the time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, and no provision gotten, (and the ship lay Idle, and would do nothing) presently imbarked himselfe in the discovery barge, giving order to the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell, to send <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Persey</hi> after him with the next barge that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the fort; 2. barges, he had himselfe, and 20. me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but arriving at <hi>Chickahamina</hi> that dogged nation, was too wel acquainted with our wants, refusing to trade, with as much scorne and insolencie as they could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse. The President perceiving it was <hi>Powhatans</hi> pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to starue vs, told them he came not so much for <note place="margin">The Chickaha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines forced to contribution,</note> their corne, as to revenge his imprisonment, and the death of his men murdered by them, &amp; so landing his men, and ready to charge them, they immediatly fled; but then they sent their imbassadours, with corne, fish, fowl, or what they had to make their peace, (their corne being that year bad) they complained extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of their owne wants, yet fraughted our boats with 100 bushels of corne, and in like manner <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Persies,</hi> that not long after vs arriued; they having done the best they could to content vs, within 4. or 5. daies we returned to Iames Towne.</p>
                     <p>Though this much contented the company (that then feared nothing but starving) yet some so envied his good successe, that they rather desired to starue, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

as our Captaine beganne with him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Opechancanough</hi> the great loue you professe with your tongue, seemes meere deceipt by your actions; <note place="margin">Smiths speech to Opechanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</note> last yeare you kindly fraughted our ship, but now you haue invited me to starue with hunger.

                     <p>The king seemed kindly to accept his offer; and the better to colour his proiect, sold vs what they had to our own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; promising the next day, more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, better provided; (the barges, and Pinnas being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the charge of <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Phetiplace)</hi> the President with his old 15 marched vp to the kings house, where we fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d 4 or 5 men newly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e with great baskets, not long after came the king, who with a strained cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes held vs with discourse, what paines he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to keepe his promise; til <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Russell</hi> brought vs in news that we were all betraied: for at least 6. or 700. of well appointed Indians had invironed the house and beset <note place="margin">700 Salvages beset the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish being but 16.</note> the fields.

                     <p>Worthy countrymen were the mischiefes of my <note place="margin">Smiths speech to his company.</note> seeming-friends, no more then the danger of these e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, I little cared, were they as many more, if you

dare do, but as I.

But this is the worst of all, wher in I pray aide me with your opinions; should wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with them and surprize this king, we cannot keep him and defend well our selues, if we should each kill our man and so proceede with al in this house; the rest will all fly, then shall we get no more, then the bodies that are slaine, and then starue for victuall: as for their fury it is the least danger; for well you know, (being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone assaulted with 2 or 300 of them) I made them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pound to saue my life, and we are now 16 &amp; they but 700. at the most, and assure your selues God wil so as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist vs, that if you dare but to stande to discharge your peeces, the very smoake will bee sufficient to affright them; yet howsoever (if there be occasion) et vs fight like men, and not die like sheep; but first I will deale with them, to bring it to passe, we may fight for some thing, and draw them to it by conditions. If you like this motion, promise me youle be valiant. The time not permitting any argument, all vowed, to execute whatsoever he attempted, or die; wherevpon the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, approaching the king bespoke him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>I see <hi>Opechancanough</hi> your plot to murder me, but I <note place="margin">Smiths offer to Opechanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</note> feare it not, as yet your men and mine, haue done no harme, but by our directions.

the Ile in your river is a fit place, if you be contented: and the conqueror (of vs two) shalbe Lord and Master over all our men; otherwaies drawe all your men into the field; if you haue not enough take time to fetch more, and bring what number you will, so everie one bring a basket of corne, against all which I will stake the value in copper; you see I haue but 15 men, &amp; our game shalbe the conquerer take all.</p>
                     <p>The king, being guarded with 50 or 60 of his chiefe <note place="margin">Opechanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noughs devise to betray Smith.</note> men, seemed kindly to appease <hi>Smiths</hi> suspition of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesse, by a great present at the dore, they intreated him to receiue. This was to draw him without the dore where the present was garded with (at the least 200 men and 30 lying vnder a greate tree (that lay thwart as a Barricado) each his arrow nocked ready to shoot; some the President commanded to go &amp; see what kinde of deceit this was, and to receiue the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, but they refused to do it, yet divers offered whom he would not permit; but commanding <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Persie</hi> and <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> VVest</hi> to make good the house, tooke <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Poell</hi> and <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Beheathland</hi> to guard the dore, and in such a rage snatched the king by his vambrace in the midst of his men, with his pistoll ready bent against his brest: thus he led the trembling king, (neare dead with feare) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst all his people, who delivering the Captaine his bow and arrowes, all his men were easily intreated to cast downe their armes, little dreaming anie durst in that manner haue vsed their king; who then to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape himselfe, bestowed his presents in goodsadnesse.

If I keepe this vow, my God will keepe me, you cannot hurt me; if I breake it he will destroie me. But if you shoot but one arrow, to shed one drop of blood of any of my men, or steale the least of these beades, or copper, (I spurne before me with my foot) you shall see, I wil not cease revenge, (if once I begin) so long as I can heare where to find one of your natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that will not deny the name of <hi>Pamavnke;</hi> I am not now at <hi>Rasseneac</hi> (halfe drownd with mire) where you tooke me prisoner, yet then for keeping your promise, and your good vsage, &amp; saving my life, I so affect you, that your denials of your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, doth half perswade me to mistake my selfe.

So the President finding his intention thus frustrated, &amp; that there was nothing now to be had, and therefore an vnfit time to revenge their abuses, helde on his course for <hi>Iames</hi> Towne; we having in this Iornie (for 25<hi rend="sup">l</hi> of copper 50<hi rend="sup">l</hi> of Iron and beads) kept 40 men 6. weekes, and dailie feasted with bread, corne, flesh fish, and fowle, everie man having for his reward (and in consideration of his commodities) a months provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; (no trade being allowed but for the store;) and we
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:22714:66"/>
delivered at Iames Towne to the Cape-Marchant 279 bushels of corne.</p>
                     <p>Those temporall proceedings to some maie seeme too charitable; to such a dailie daring trecherous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: to others vnpleasant that we washed not the ground with their blouds, nor shewed such strange in ventions, in mangling, murdering, ransaking, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying, (as did the Spaniards) the simple bodies of those ignorant soules; nor delightful because not stuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with relations of heaps, and mines of gold and sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, nor such rare commodities as the Portugals and Spaniards found in the East &amp; West Indies. The wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wherof hath begot vs (that were the first vndertakers) no lesse scorne and contempt, then their noble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests &amp; valiant adventures (beautified with it) praise and honor. Too much I confesse the world cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to their ever memorable merit. And to cleare vs from the worlds blind ignorant censure, these fewe words may suffise to any reasonably vnderstanding.</p>
                     <p>It was the Spaniards good hap to happen in those parts, where were infinite numbers of people, whoe had manured the ground with that providence, that it afforded victuall at all times: and time had brought them to that perfection, they had the vse of gold and silver, and the most of such commodities, as their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries afforded, so that what the Spaniard got, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the spoile and pillage of those countrie people, and not the labours of their owne hands. But had those fruitfull Countries, beene as Salvage as barbarous, as ill peopled, as little planted, laboured and manured as <hi>Virginia,</hi> their proper labours (it is likely) would haue
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:22714:66"/>
produced as small profit as ours. But had <hi>Virginia</hi> bin peopled, planted, manured, and adorned, with such store of pretious Iewels, &amp; rich commodities, as was the Indies: then had we not gotten, and done as much as by their examples might bee expected from vs, the world might then haue traduced vs and our merits, &amp; haue made shame and infamy our recompence and reward.</p>
                     <p>But we chanced in a lande, even as God made it. Where we found only an idle, improvident, scattered people; ignorant of the knowledge of gold, or silver, or any commodities; &amp; carelesse of any thing but fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hand to mouth, but for bables of no worth; nothing to encourage vs, but what accidentally wee found na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture afforded.

But to conclude, against all rumor of opinion, I only say this, for those that the three first yeares began this plantation, notwithstanding al their factions, mutenies, and miseries, so gently corrected,

nothing done, but victuall spent, and the most part of our tooles, and a good part of our armes convayed to the Salvages. But now, casting vp the store, &amp; finding sufficient till the next harvest, the feare of starving was abandoned; and the company divided into tennes, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenes, or as the businesse required. 4 houres each day was spent in worke, the rest in pastimes and merry ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise; but the vntowardnesse of the greatest number, caused the President to make a generall assembly, and then he advised them as followeth.</p>

Hee made also a table as a publike memoriall of every mans deserts, to encourage the good, and with shame to spurne on the rest to amendment.

we built a blocke house with a garrison, to giue vs notice of any shipping, and for their exercise they made clapbord, wainscot, and cut downe trees against the ships comming. We built also a fort for a retreat, neare a convenient river vpon a high commanding hill, very hard to be assaulted, and easie to be defended; but ere it was halfe finished this defect caused a stay; in searching our casked corne, wee found it halfe rotten, the rest so consumed with the many thousand rats (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased first from the ships) that we knewe not how to keepe that little wee had. This did driue vs all to our wits ende, for there was nothing in the countrie but what nature afforded. vntill this time <hi>Keinps</hi> and <hi>Tas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore,</hi> were fettered prisoners, and daily wrought, and taught vs how to order and plant our fields. Whome now (for want of victuall) we set at libertie, but so wel were they vsed, that they little desired it; and to express their loues, for 16 daies continuance, the Countrie brought vs (when least) 100 a daie of squirrils, Turkies, Deare, and other wild beastes; but this want of corne occasioned the end of all our workes, it being worke sufficient to provide victuall. 60 or 80 with Ensigne Laxon were sent downe the river to liue vpon oysters, &amp; 20 with leiftenant <hi>Percie</hi> to trie for fishing at point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort, but in 6 weekes, they would not agree once to cast out their net. <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> West</hi> with as many went vp to the falles, but nothing could bee found but a fewe berries and acornes; of that in the store every one had their equall proportion.

Fellow souldiers, I did little thinke any so false to <note place="margin">The Presidents speech to the drones.</note> report, or so many so simple to be perswaded, that I ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to starue you, or that <hi>Powhatan</hi> (at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) hath corne for himselfe, much lesse for you; or that I would not haue it, if I knewe where it were to be had. Neither did I thinke any so malitious as nowe I see a great many, yet it shall not so much passionate me, but I will doe my best for my worst maligner. But dreame no longer of this vaine hope from <hi>Powhatan,</hi> nor that I wil longer forbeare to force you from your Idlenesse, and punish you if you raile, you cannotdeny but that by the hazard of my life, many a time I haue saued yours, when, might your owne wils haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, you would haue starued, and will doe still whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will or no. But I protest by that God that made me, since necessitie hath not power to force you to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gather for your selus those fruits the earth doth yeeld, you shall not only gather for your selues, but for those that are sicke: as yet I never had more from the store then the worst of you; and all my English extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie provision that I haue, you shall see mee devide among the sick. And this Salvage trash, you so scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully repine at, being put in your mouthes your sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks can digest it, and therefore I will take a course you shall provide it.

                     <p>This order many murmured, was very cruell, but it caused the most part so well bestir themselues, that

But nothing could we learne but they were all dead, this honest, proper, good promis-keeping king, of all the rest did ever best affect vs, &amp; though to his false Gods he was yet very zealous, yet he would confesse, our God as much exceeded his, as our guns did his bowe and arrowes, often sending our President manie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents to praie to his God for raine, or his corne would perish, for his Gods were angrie all this time. to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime the Dutchmen, and one <hi>Bentley</hi> an other fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, we imploied one <hi>Willia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Volda</hi> (a <hi>Switzer</hi> by birth) with pardons and promises to regaine them.

our Pinnas; but bring to his service and subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the most part of our companies. With this plot they had acquainted manie discontents and manie were agreed to their divelish practise. But on <hi>Thomas Douese</hi> &amp; <hi>Thomas Mallard,</hi> whose christian harts much relenting at such an vnchristian act, voluntarily revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it to Captaine <hi>Smith:</hi> who did his best it might be concealed, perswading <hi>Douese</hi> and <hi>Malard</hi> to proceed in the confederacie: onlie to bring the irreclamable Dutch men, and inconstant Salvages in such a maner amongst his ambuscadoes, as he had prepared, as not manie of them shoulde ever haue returned from out our penisula. But this brute co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to the ears of the impatient multitude, they so importuned the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to cut of those Dutchmen, as amongst manie that offered to cut their throates before the face of <hi>Powhatan.

returne for England, still dissembling <hi>Valdo</hi> his villany, but certainlie hee had not escaped had the President continued.</p>
                     <p>By this you may see, for all those crosses, treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and dissentions, howe he wrastled and overcame <note place="margin">Note these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.</note> (without bloud shed) all that hapned. Also what good was done, how few died, what food the country natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally affordeth, what small cause there is men shoulde starue, or be murdered by the Salvages, that haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion to manage this courage and industry. The 2. first years though by his adve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tures he had oft brought the Salvages to a tractable trade, yet you see how the envious authority ever crossed him, and frustrated his best endeavours. Yet this wrought in him that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and estimation among the Salvages, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies it had bin impossible he had ever effected that he did, though the many miserable yet generous and worthy adventures, he had long, &amp; oft indured as wel in some parts of <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> as in the most partes of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia</hi> by land or sea had taught him much, yet in this case he was againe to learne his Lecture by experience. Which with thus much a doe having obtained, it was his ill chance to end, when hee had but onlie learned how to begin. And though hee left these vnknowne difficulties, (made easie and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar) to his vnlawfull successors, whoe onlie by living in Iames Towne, presumed to know more then al the world could direct them though they had all his soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with their triple power, and twise triple better meanes, by what they haue done in his absence, the world doth see: and what they would haue done in his

presence, had he not prevented their indiscretions: it doth iustlie approue what cause he had to send them for England. but they haue made it more plaine since their returne, having his absolute authoritie freely in their power, with all the advantages, and opportunity that his labours had effected. As I am sorry their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haue made it so manifest, so I am vnwilling to say what reason doth compell me, to make apparant the truth, least I should seeme partial, reasonlesse, or mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>

But having spent 9. daies in seeking to reclaime them, shewing them how much they did abuse themselues,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:22714:77"/>
with their great guilded hopes, of seas, mines, commo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dities, or victories they so madly conceived. Then (see<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing nothing would prevaile with them) he set saile for <hi>Iames</hi> Towne: now no sooner was the ship vnder saile but the Salvages assaulted those 120 in their fort, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">An assault by the Salvages</note> some stragling abroad in the woods they slew manie, and so affrighted the rest, as their prisoners es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, &amp; they scarse retired, with the swords &amp; cloaks of these they had slaine. But ere we had sailed a league our shippe grounding, gaue vs once more libertie to summon them to a parlie.

left them to their fortunes, they returning againe to the open aire at west fort, abandoning Nonsuch, and he to <hi>Iames</hi> Towne with his best expedition, but this hapned him in that Iournie.</p>
                     <p>Sleeping in his boat, (for the ship was returned 2 <note place="margin">C Smith blowne vp with powder.</note> daies before,) accidentallie, one fired his powder bag, which tore his flesh from his bodie and thighes, 9. or 10. inches square in a most pittifull manner; but to quench the tormenting fire, frying him in his cloaths he leaped over bord into the deepe river, where ere they could recover him he was neere drownd. In this estat, without either Chirurgio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or chirurgery he was to go neare 100. miles.

those humors and factions, had the ships but once left them and vs to our fortunes, and haue made that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision from among the Salvages, as we neither feared Spanyard, Salvage, nor famine: nor would haue left <hi>Virginia,</hi> nor our lawfull authoritie, but at as deare a price as we had bought it, and paid for it. What shall I say? but thus we lost him, that in all his proceedings, made Iustice his first guid, and experience his second; ever hating basenesse, sloth, pride, and indignitie, more then any dangers; that never allowed more for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, then his souldiers with him; that vpon no danger would send them where he would not lead them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; that would never see vs want what he either had, or could by any meanes get vs; that would rather want then borrow, or starue then not pay; that loved acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more then wordes, and hated falshood and cous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage worse then death: whose adventures were our liues, and whose losse our deathes. Leaving vs thus with 3 ships, 7 boates, commodities ready to trade, the harvest newly gathered, 10 weekes provision in the store, 490 and odde persons, 24 peeces of ordinances, 300 muskets snaphanches, and fire lockes, shot, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and match sufficient, curats, pikes, swords, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryons more then men: the Salvages their language &amp; habitations wel knowne to 100 well trained and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert souldiers; nets for fishing, tooles of all sortes to worke, apparell to supply our wants, 6 mares and a horse, 5 or 600 swine, as many hens and chicken; some goates, some sheep, what was brought or bread there remained, but they regarded nothing but from hand to mouth, to consume that we had, tooke care for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

but to perfit some colourable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints against Captaine <hi>Smith,</hi> for effecting whereof, 3 weekes lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger they stayed the 6 ships til they could produce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. that time and charge might much better haue beene spent, but it suted well with the rest of their discreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>Now all those, <hi>Smith</hi> had either whipped, punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaints and proofe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</note> or any way disgraced, had free power and liberty to say or sweare any thing, and from a whole armefull of their examinations this was concluded.</p>
                     <p>The mutiners at the Falles, complained hee caused the Salvages assalt them, for that hee would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their losse, they being but 120, and he 5 men and himselfe, and this they proved by the oath of one hee had oft whipped for periurie and pilfering. The dutch-men that he had appointed to bee stabd for their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries, swore he sent to poison them with rats baine. The prudent Councel, that he would not submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to their stolne authoritie. <hi>Coe</hi> &amp; <hi>Drer,</hi> that should haue murdered him, were highly preferred for swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they heard one say, he heard <hi>Powhatan</hi> say, that he heard a man say: if the king would not send that corne he had, he should not long enioy his copper crowne, nor those robes he had sent him: yet those also swore hee might haue had corne for tooles but would not. The truth was, <hi>Smith</hi> had no such ingins as the king demanded, nor <hi>Powhatan</hi> any corne. Yet this argued he would starue them. Others complained hee would not let them rest in the fort (to starue) but forced the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the oyster bankes, to liue or starue, as he liued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. For though hee had of his owne private provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:22714:79"/>
sent from England, sufficient; yet hee gaue it all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to the weake and sicke, causing the most vnto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (by doing as he did) to gather their food from the vnknowne parts of the rivers &amp; woods, that they lived (though hardly) that otherwaies would haue star<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved, ere they would haue left their beds, or at most the sight of <hi>Iames</hi> Towne to haue got their own victuall. Some propheticall spirit calculated hee had the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in such subiection, hee would haue made himselfe a king, by marrying <hi>Pocahontas, Powhatans</hi> daughter. It <note place="margin">Pocahontas Powhatans daughter.</note> is true she was the very nomparell of his kingdome, &amp; at most not past 13 or 14 yeares of age. Very oft shee came to our fort, with what shee could get for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Smith,</hi> that ever loved and vsed all the Countrie well, but her especially he ever much respected: &amp; she so well requited it, that when her father intended to haue surprized him, shee by stealth in the darke night came through the wild woods and told him of it. But her marriage could no way haue intitled him by any right to the kingdome, nor was it ever suspected hee had ever such a thought, or more regarded her, or any of them, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in honest reason, &amp; discreation he might. If he would he might haue married her, or haue done what him listed. For there was none that could haue hindred his determination. Some that knewe not any thing to say, the Councel instructed, and advised what to sweare. So diligent they were in this businesse, that what any could remember, hee had ever done, or said in mirth, or passion, by some circumstantiall oath, it was applied to their fittest vse, yet not past8 or 9 could <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

all men did knowe was most false and vntrue. Many got their passes by promising in England to say much against him.

For the honorable and better sort of our Virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an adventurers I think they vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it as I haue writ it.

Since there was a ship fraughted with provision, and 40 men, and another since then with the like num ber and provision to stay in the Countrie 12 months with Captaine <hi>Argall.</hi>

                     <p>The Lord governour himselfe doth confidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine to goe with the next, or as presently as hee may in his owne person, with sundry other knights &amp; gentlemen, with ships &amp; men so farre as their meanes will extend to furnish: as for all their particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons since the returne of Captaine <hi>Smith,</hi> for that they haue beene printed from time to time, and published to the world, I cease farther to trouble you with any repetition of things so well knowne, more then are necessarie. To conclude the historie, leauing this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to all posteritie, howe vnprosperously things may succeed, by what changes or chances soever, The action is honorable and worthie to bee approved, the defect whereof hath only beene in the managing the businesse; which I hope now experience hath taught them to amend, or those examples may make others to beware, for the land is as good as this booke doth report it.</p>

I cannot finde there is any thing, but what they all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, or cannot contradict: the land is good: as there is no citties, so no sonnes of <hi>Anak:</hi> al is open for labor of a good and wise inhabitant: and my prayer shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be, that so faire a land, may bee inhabited by those that professe and loue the Gospell.</p>
