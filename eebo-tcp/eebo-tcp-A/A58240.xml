            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>REASONS</hi> for paſſing a Bill in <hi>PARLIAMENT</hi> to Erect three Courts of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> in the three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diviſions hereafter Named, being within the Bills of Mortality, and without the City of <hi>London,</hi> and the Liberties thereof; for Relief of poor <hi>Debtors</hi> and <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,</hi> under the Value of Forty Shillings, to prevent vexatious and chargeable Arrests and Suits at Law.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>FIrſt,</hi> the Diviſion of the Burrough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> with the Pariſhes in the County of <hi>Surrey,</hi> mentioned in the Bills of Mortality.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Diviſion of the Hamlets of the <hi>Tower</hi> Liberty, with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes in the Bills of Mortality, contained within the Hamlets of the <hi>Tower</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Diviſion called <hi>Holborn</hi> Diviſion, conſiſting of the remaining Pariſhes, and part of Pariſhes in <hi>Middleſex</hi> (not comprehending <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> nor the Liberties thereof) likewiſe mentioned in the Bills of Mortality.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Court of Conſcience</hi> for the City of <hi>London,</hi> was firſt erected by an Act of <hi>Common Council</hi> of the ſaid City, in the Nineteenth Year of King-<hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Court being found to be good and Charitable, of great Eaſe and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit both to the poor Debtors and Creditors, as alſo much tending to the quiet and welfare of the City and Encouragement of Trade, was in the firſt and Third years of King <hi>James</hi> the firſt, eſtabliſhed by Parliament, ſtill limiting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the Juriſdiction of the ſaid Court to the Citizens and Free-men of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and other perſons that inhabit or ſhall inhabit within the ſaid City or the Liberties thereof, being a Tradeſman, Victualler, or Labourer. Nor did the Juriſdiction of the ſaid Court of <hi>Conſcience</hi> ever yet extend further than the City of <hi>London</hi> and the Liberties thereof.</p>
            <p>That the Burrough of <hi>Southwark,</hi> and the Out-Pariſhes within the Bills of Mortality, are of late Years vaſtly increaſed in Buildings and Inhabitants, and abound in poor Tradeſmen, Artificers, Laboures, Victuallers and others, far exceeding the City of <hi>London</hi> and the Liberties thereof: who for want of the like good Eſtabliſhment of a Court or Courts of Conſcience amongſt them, are expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to many and great Inconveniences tending to the impoveriſhment and ruine of themſelves and Families. As,</p>
            <p>Many vexatious Suits are daily commenced for inconſiderable Sums, and through extremity of Poverty, uſual Exactions, the Implacability of Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, frequent Impriſonments, and coſt of Suit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they are often put to ſix times more Charges than the Debt was; whereby many Families are left to the Pariſh, the Priſons filled with poor helpleſs Men and Women, Sickneſſes contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and Trade in a great meaſure hindred.</p>
            <p>All which a Salutary Act for the <hi>Courts, of Conſcience</hi> or <hi>Requeſt,</hi> above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, might in a good part prevent, as hath been experienced in the City of <hi>London</hi> and Liberties thereof, during the long time the like Court hath been there holden, Which is humbly ſubmitted to the Prudence of this preſent Parliament.</p>
