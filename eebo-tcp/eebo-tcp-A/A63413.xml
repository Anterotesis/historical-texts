         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SIr <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> drew up the following Relation, at
a Friend's deſire, who was unwilling, that Poſterity ſhould

the <hi>FRENCH,</hi> against the <hi>SPANIARDS,</hi> and thought the
Right they did their Country, by their Behaviour, might make
ſome amends, for the Occaſion of their being in that Service. It
had been printed in the last Reign, if the Authority of it had
not interpoſed, becauſe there was not ſo much ſaid of ſome, who
were <hi>then</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, as they expected; and is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
now to let the World ſee, that more was owing to Our

Opportunity to leſſen their Merit; and being in the right Wing

Reflection he himſelf makes,<note n="*" place="margin">Part II. p. 139.</note> a little after, upon the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

to add, that theſe Papers came to the Publiſher's hand, from the
Gentleman, at whoſe Request they were wrote, and to whom
Sir <hi>Thomas Morgan</hi> confirmed every Paragraph of them, as
they were read over, at the time he deliver'd them to him;
which, beſides the unaffected Plainneſs of the Style, may be ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

            <p>THE <hi>French</hi> King, and his Eminence the Cardinal <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine,</hi>
came to view the Six Thouſand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> near
<hi>Charleroy,</hi> and ordered Major-General <hi>Morgan,</hi> with
the ſaid Six Thouſand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to march and make
conjunction with Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Army, who
ſoon after the conjunction,<note place="margin">The Siege of St. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
               </note> beleaguer'd a Town, call'd St. <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
on the Borders of <hi>Flanders.</hi> Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
the Town on the Eaſt-ſide, and Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi>
with his Six Thouſand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and a Brigade of <hi>French-</hi>Horſe
on the Weſt, the Army encamp'd betwixt Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi>'s
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101904:4"/>
Approaches and Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi>'s; and being to relieve
Count <hi>Schomberg,</hi> out of the Approaches of the Weſt-ſide of the
Town, Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> marched into the Approaches
with Eight Hundred <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> at that time being
ſtrangers in Approaches, Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> inſtructed the
Officers and Soldiers to take their Places by Fifties, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they might relieve the Point to carry on the Approaches eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Hour. In the mean time whil'ſt we beſieged the Town, the
Enemy h<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d beleaguered a Town called <hi>Ardres,</hi> within five Miles
of <hi>Calis.</hi> In the Evening Count <hi>Schomberg,</hi> with Six Noblemen,
came upon the Point, to ſee how Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> carried
on his Approaches, but there happened a little confuſion by the
Soldiers intermingling themſelves in the Approaches, ſo as there
was never an entire Fifty to be called to the Point. Count <hi>Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi>
and his Noblemen taking notice thereof, Major-General
<hi>Morgan</hi> was much troubled, leap'd upon the Point, and called
out Fifty to take up the Spades, Pickaxes, and Faſcines, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him: But ſo it happen'd, that all in the Approaches leap'd
out after him, the Enemy in the mean time firing as faſt as they
could. Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> conceiving his loſs in bringing
them again to their Approaches, would be greater than in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
them forward, paſſed over a Channel of Water, on which
there was a Bridge and a Turnpike, and the Soldiers crying out,
<hi>Fall on, fall on,</hi> he fell upon the Counterſcarp, beat the Enemy
from it,<note place="margin">St. <hi>Venant</hi> taken by the Major-General.</note> and three Redoubts, which caus'd them to Capitulate,
and the next Morning to ſurrender the Town, and receive a
<hi>French</hi> Garriſon; ſo as the ſudden reduction thereof, gave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
<hi>Turenne</hi> an opportunity afterwards to march and relieve
<hi>Ardres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next place Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> beſieged was <hi>Mardike,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in twice eight and forty Hours by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mardike</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered there.</note>
After the taking whereof Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> was ſetled
there by the Order of the <hi>French</hi> King, and <hi>Oliver,</hi> with Two
Thouſand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and One Thouſand <hi>French,</hi> in order to the
bleaguering <hi>Dunkirk</hi> the next Spring.</p>
            <p>The reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were quartered in <hi>Borborch.</hi> For the
ſpace of Four Months, there was hardly a Week wherein Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General
<hi>Morgan</hi> had not two or three Alarms by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Army: He anſwered to them all, and never went out of his
Clothes all the Winter, except to change is Shirt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101904:4"/>
The next Spring Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> beleaguered <hi>Dunkirk</hi> on
the <hi>Newport</hi>-ſide,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dunkirk</hi> beſieged by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi>
               </note> and Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> on the <hi>Mardike</hi>-ſide,
with his Six Thouſand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and a Brigade of <hi>French</hi>
Horſe: He made a Bridge over the Canal betwixt that and <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi>
that there might be Communication betwixt Mareſchal
<hi>Turenne</hi>'s Camp and his. When <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was cloſe inveſted,
Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> ſent a Summons to the Governour, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<hi>de Leda,</hi> a great Captain and brave Defender of a Siege;
but the Summons being anſwered with Defiance, Mareſchal <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
immediately broke Ground, and carried on the Approaches
on his ſide, whil'ſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did the ſame on theirs; and 'tis
obſervable the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had two Miles to march every Day upon
relieving their Approaches. In this manner the Approaches were
carried on, both by the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for the ſpace of
twelve Nights, when the Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> had intelligence,
that the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> &amp;c. coming to relieve it with 30000 Men.</note> the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> Don <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi>
and the Prince <hi>de Ligny,</hi> were at the Head of Thirty
Thouſand Horſe and Foot, with reſolution to relieve <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Immediately, upon this Intelligence, Mareſchal <hi>Turenne,</hi> and
ſeveral Noble-men of <hi>France</hi> went to the King and Cardinal at
<hi>Mardike,</hi> acquainted his Eminence therewith, and deſired his
Majeſty, and his Eminence the Cardinal, to withdraw their
Perſons into ſafety and leave their Orders: His Majeſty an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
That he knew no better Place of Safety than at the
Head of his Army; but ſaid it was convenient the Cardinal
ſhould withdraw to <hi>Calis.</hi> Then Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> and the
Noble-men made anſwer, They could not be ſatisfied, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
his Majeſty withdrew himſelf into ſafety; which was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to.<note place="margin">Upon which the King and Cardinal retire.</note> And the King and Cardinal marching to <hi>Calis</hi> left
open Orders with Mareſchal <hi>Turenne,</hi> That if the Enemy came
on, to give Battle or raiſe the Siege, as he ſhould be adviſed by
a Council of War.</p>
            <p>The Enemy came on to <hi>Bruges,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> calls a Counil of War with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Engliſh:</hi>
               </note> and then Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi>
thought it high time to call a Council of War, which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

du Camp; but never ſent to Embaſſadour <hi>Lockhart,</hi> or
Major-General <hi>Morgan.</hi> The whole Senſe of the Council of
War was, That it was great danger to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:101904:5"/>
to hazard a Battle in that ſtreight Country,<note place="margin">Where 'twas a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon not to fight.</note> full of Canals and
Ditches of Water; and ſeveral Reaſons being ſhewn to that
purpoſe, it ran thorough the Council of War, to raiſe the
Siege, if the Enemy came on. Within half an Hour after
the Council of War was riſen, Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> had the
Reſult of it in his Camp, and went immediately to Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
<hi>Lockhart,</hi> to know if he heard any thing of it: He ſaid
he heard nothing of it, and complained that he was much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with the Stone, Gravel, and ſome other Impediments.
Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> asked him to go with him the next
Morning to the Head-Quarters: He ſaid he would, if he were
able.</p>
            <p>Next Morning Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> ſent a Noble-man to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour

the Noble-man to Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Camp; and, by that time
they came there the Council of War was ready to ſit down in
Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Tent.</p>
            <p>Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> ſatisfied the Council of War, that he had
forgot to ſend for Embaſſadour <hi>Lockhart,</hi> and Major-General
<hi>Morgan</hi> to the firſt Council of War, and therefore thought
ſit to call this, that they might be ſatisfy'd; and then put
the Queſtion, Whether, if the Enemy came on, he ſhould
make good the Siege on <hi>Newport</hi>-ſide, and give them Battle;
or raiſe the Siege? And required they ſhould give their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
for either. The Mareſchals du Camp ran away with it
clearly to raiſe the Siege, alledging what Danger it was to the
Crown of <hi>France,</hi> to hazard a Battle, within ſo ſtreight a
Country, full of Canals, and Ditches of Water; farther al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging,
that if the Enemy came upon the Bank, they would
cut between Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi>'s, and Major-General <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi>'s
Camps, and prevent their conjunction. Two of the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-Generals
ran along with the Mareſchals du Camp, and
ſhew'd the ſame Reaſons: But Major-General <hi>Morgan,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it was high time to ſpeak, and that otherwiſe it would
go round the Board, roſe up, and deſired, though out of
courſe, that he might declare his mind, in oppoſition to what
<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Mareſchals du Camp, and the two Lieutenant-Generals,
had declared. Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> told him he ſhould have free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101904:5"/>
to ſpeak his Thoughts. Then <hi>Major-General Morgan</hi> ſpoke,
and ſaid, That the Reaſons the <hi>Marſchals du Camp,</hi> and the two
<hi>Lieutenant-Generals</hi> had given for raiſing the Seige, were no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
for the Streightneſs of the Country was as good for the
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> as for the Enemy: <hi>And whereas they alledg'd,
That if the Enemy came on the Bank between</hi> Turnes <hi>and</hi> Dunkirk,<note place="margin">And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade them to Fight.</note> 
               <hi>they
would cut between Mareſchal</hi> Turenne'<hi>s, and Major-General</hi> Morgan<hi>'s
Camps; Major-General Morgan,</hi> replied, It was impoſſible, for
they could not March upon the Bank above eight a Breaſt; and
farther he alledged, that Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Artillery and ſmall
Shot, would cut them off at Pleaſure: He added, That that was
not the way the Enemy could relieve <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> but that they
would make a Bridge of Boats over the Chanel, in an hour and
half, and croſs their Army upon the Sands of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> to offer
<hi>Marſchal Turenne</hi> battle.</p>
            <p>Farther <hi>Major-General Morgan</hi> did allege, what a Diſhonour it
would be to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> to have Summon'd the City
of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and broke Ground before it, and then raiſe the Siege
and run away; and he deſired the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>War</hi> would conſider,
that if they rais'd the Siege, the Alliance with <hi>England</hi> would
be broken the ſame hour.</p>
            <p>Mareſchal Turenne <hi>anſwered,</hi> 
               <q>That if he thought, the Enemy
would offer that fair Game, he would maintain the Siege on <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>
ſide, and Major-General Morgan ſhould march, and make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
with the French Army, and leave <hi>Mardike</hi> ſide open.</q> 
               <hi>Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
Mareſchal Turenne<hi>'s Reply,</hi> Major-General Morgan <hi>did riſe
from the Board, and upon his Knees begg'd a Battle, and ſaid,
that he would venture the Six Thouſand</hi> Engliſh, <hi>every Soul.
Upon which</hi> Mareſchel Turenne <hi>conſulted the Noble-men that ſat
next him, and it was deſired, that</hi> Major-General Morgan <hi>might
walk a turn or two without the Tent, and he ſhould be call'd
immediately. After he had walked two turns, he was call'd in;
as ſoon as he came in,</hi> Mareſchal Turenne <hi>ſaid,</hi> 
               <q>That he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
his Reaſons, and that himſelf and the <hi>Council of War</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to give Battle to the Enemy, if they came on; and to maintain
the Siege on <hi>Newport</hi> ſide, and that <hi>Major-General Morgan</hi> was
to make Conjunction with the French Army.</q> Major-General Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
<hi>then ſaid,</hi> That with God's Aſſiſtance, we ſhould be able to deal with
them.</p>
            <p>The very next Day at four in the Afternoon the Spaniſh Army
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101904:6"/>
had made a Bridge of Boats, croſſed their Army on the Sands of
<hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and drew up into Battalia, within two Miles of <hi>Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Turenne</hi>'s Lines, before he knew any thing of them. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
all the <hi>French</hi> Horſe drew out to face the Enemy at a
Mile's diſtance, and <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> ſent immediate Orders
to <hi>Major-General Morgan,</hi> to March into his Camp, with the ſix
Thouſand <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Brigade of Horſe; which
was done accordingly.</p>
            <p>The next day about eight of the Clock, <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> gave
Orders to break Avenues on both the Lines, that the Army
might March out in Battalia. <hi>Major-General Morgan</hi> ſet his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
to break Avenues for their marching out in Battalia like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
Several Officers being with him as he was looking on his
Soldiers at work, <hi>Embaſſadour Lockhart</hi> comes up with a white
Cap on his Head, and ſaid to <hi>Major-General Morgan,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>You ſee
what Condition I am in, I am not able to give you any Aſſiſtance this
day, you are the older Soldier, and the greatest part of the Work of this
day, muſt lie upon your Soldiers.</hi>
               </q> Upon which the Officers ſmiled,
and ſo he bid <hi>God be with us,</hi> and went away with the <hi>Lieutenant
General</hi> of the <hi>Horſe</hi> that was upon our left Wing; from which
time we never ſaw him till we were in purſuit of the Enemy.
When the Avenues were cleared, both the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Army marched out of the Lines towards the Enemy. We
were forced to march up in four Lines, (for we had
not room enough to Wing, for the Canal between <hi>Furnes</hi> and
<hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and the Sea) till we had marched above half a mile;
then we came to a Halt on riſing Hills of Sand, and having more
room took in two of our Lines.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Major-General Morgan</hi> ſeeing the Enemy plain in Battalia, ſaid
before the Head of the Army, <q>
                  <hi>See yonder are the Gentlemen you have to
trade withal.</hi>
               </q> Upon which the whole Brigade of <hi>Engliſh</hi> gave a
Shout of Rejoycing, that made a roaring Eccho betwixt the Sea
and the Canal. Thereupon the <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> came up with
above a hundred Noble-men, to know what was the matter and
reaſon of that great Shout. <hi>Major General Morgan</hi> told him,
<hi>'Twas an uſual Cuſtom of the Redcoats, when they ſaw the Enemy, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> anſwer'd, <hi>They were Men of brave Reſolution and
Courage.</hi> After which <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> returning to the Head of
his Army, we put on to our March again. At the ſecond Halt,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101904:6"/>
the whole Brigade of <hi>Engliſh</hi> gave a Shout and caſt up their Caps
into the Air, ſaying, <q>
                  <hi>They would have better Hats before Night.</hi>
               </q>
               <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> upon that Shout, came up again, with ſeveral
Noble-men and Officers of the Army, admiring the Reſolution
of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> at which time we were within three quarters of
a Mile of the Enemy in Battalia. <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> deſired
Major-General <hi>Morgan,</hi> that at the next halt, he would keep even
front with the <hi>French,</hi> for ſays he, <q>
                  <hi>I do intend to halt at ſome
diſtance, that we may ſee how the Enemy is drawn up, and take our
Advantage accordingly.</hi>
               </q> Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> demanded of his
Excellency, <hi>Whether he would Shock the whole Army at one daſh, or try
one Wing first?</hi> Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi>'s Reply was, <q>
                  <hi>That as to that
Queſtion, he could not reſolve him yet, till he came nearer the Enemy.</hi>
               </q>
Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> deſired the Mereſchal, <hi>not to let him Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
for Orders,</hi> ſaying, <q>
                  <hi>That oftentimes Opportunities are often lost
for want of Orders in due time.</hi>
               </q> Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> ſaid, <hi>he would
either come himſelf and give Orders, or ſend a Lieutenant-General;</hi> and
ſo Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> parted, and went to the Head of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
In the mean time Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> gave Orders to
the Colonels, and Leading-Officers, to have a ſpecial Care, that
when the <hi>French</hi> came to a halt, they keep even front with them;
and farther told them, if they could not obſerve the <hi>French,</hi>
they ſhould take Notice when he lifted up his Hat (for he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſtill above threeſcore before the Center of the Bodies): But
when the <hi>French</hi> came to halt, it ſo happened, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
preſſed upon their Leading-Officers, ſo that they came up under
the Shot of the Enemies: But when they ſaw that Major-General
<hi>Morgan</hi> was in a Paſſion, they put themſelves to a ſtand. Major-General
<hi>Morgan</hi> could ſoon have remedied their Forwardneſs, but
he was reſolved he would not loſe one Foot of Ground he had
advanced, but would hold it as long as he could. We were ſo near
the Enemy, the Soldiers fell into great Friendſhip, one asking,
is ſuch an Officer in your Army; another, is ſuch a Soldier in
yours; and this paſſed on both ſides. Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi>
endured this Friendſhip for a little while, and then came up to the
Center of the Bodies, and demanded, <hi>How long that Friendſhip
would continue;</hi> and told them farther, that for any thing they
knew, they would be cutting one anothers Throats, within a
minute of an hour. The whole Brigade anſwered, <hi>Their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
ſhould continue no longer than he pleaſed.</hi> Then Major-General
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101904:7"/>
               <hi>Morgan</hi> bid then tell the Enemy, <hi>No more Friendſhip; Prepare your
Buff-coats and Scarfs, for we will be with you ſooner then you expect us.</hi>
Immediately after the Friendſhip was broke, the Enemy poured
a volley of Shot into one of our Battalions, wounded three or
four, and one drop'd. The <hi>Major-General</hi> immediately ſent the
<hi>Adjutant-General</hi> to <hi>Mareſchal Turenne,</hi> for Orders, <hi>whether he
ſhould charge the Enemies right Wing, or whether</hi> Mareſchal Turenne
<hi>would engage the Enemies Left-wing,</hi> and adviſed the Adjutant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
not to ſtay, but to acquaint <hi>Mareſchal Turenne,</hi> that we were
under the Enemies Shot, and had received ſome Prejudice alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
but there was no return of the <hi>Adjutant-General,</hi> nor Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
By and by the Enemy poured in another volley of Shot,
into another of our Battalions, and wounded two or three.
<hi>Major-General Morgan</hi> obſerving the Enemy mending Faults, and
opening the Intervals of the Foot, to bring Horſe in, which
would have made our Work more difficult, called all the Collonels
and Officers of the Field together, before the Center of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and told them, <hi>he had ſent the</hi> Adjutant-General <hi>for Orders,
but when he ſaw there was no hope of Orders, he told them if they would
concurr with him, he would immediately charge the Enemies right
Wing:</hi> Their anſwer was, <q>
                  <hi>They were ready whenever he gave Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
               </q>
He told them, <hi>he would try the right Wing with the Blew
Regiment, and the four hundred Fire-locks, which were in the Interval
of the French Horſe; and wiſhed all the Field-Officers to be ready at
their ſeveral Poſts. Major-General Morgan</hi> gave Orders, that the
other five Regiments, ſhould not move from their Ground, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they ſaw the Blew Regiment, the White, and the four Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Fire-locks, ſhock'd the Enemies Right Wing off, of their
Ground, and farther ſhow'd the ſeveral Colonels, what Colours
they were to charge, and told them moreover, <q>
                  <hi>That if he was
not knock'd on the Head, he would come to them.</hi>
               </q> In like manner as
faſt as he could, he admoniſhed the whole Brigade, and told
them, <hi>They were to look in the Face of an Enemy who had violated, and
endeavoured to take away their Reputation, and that they had no other
way, but to Fight it out to the laſt man, or to be killed, taken Priſoner,
or Drowned; and</hi> farther, <hi>that the Honour of England</hi> did depend
much upon their Gallantry and Reſolution that Day.</p>
            <p>The Enemies Wing was poſted on a Sandy Hill,<note place="margin">The Battle of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk.</hi>
               </note> and had caſt
the Sand Breaſt high before them: Then <hi>Major-General Morgan,</hi>
did order the Blew Regiment and the four Hundred Fire-locks,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101904:7"/>
to advance to the Charge. In the mean time <hi>Major-General Morgan,</hi>
knowing the Enemy would all bend upon them that did advance,
removed the White Regiment more to the Right, that it might
be in the Flank of them, by that time the Blew Regiment was
got within puſh of Pike.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Royal Highneſs</hi> the <hi>Duke of York,</hi> with a ſelect Party of Horſe,
had got into the Blew Regiment, by that time the White came
in, and expoſed his Perſon to great Danger: But we knew no
body at that time. Immediately the Enemy were clear ſhock'd
off of their Ground, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours flying over their
Heads, the ſtrongeſt Officers and Soldiers Clubbing them down.
<hi>Major-General Morgan,</hi> when he ſaw his opportunity, ſtept to the
other five Regiments which were within ſix Score of him, and
ordered them to advance, and charge immediately: But when
they came within ten Pikes length, the Enemy perceiving they
were not able to endure our Charge,<note place="margin">The Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh fly.</note> 
               <hi>Shak'd their Hats, held up
their Handkercheifs, and called for Quarter;</hi> but the Redcoats cry'd
aloud, <hi>they had no leiſure for Quarter.</hi> Whereupon the Enemy fac'd
about, and would not endure our Charge, but fell to run, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours over ther Heads, and the ſtrongeſt Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
and Officers Clubbing them down, ſo that the ſix Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Engliſh</hi> carried Ten or Twelve Thouſand Horſe and Foot
before them. The <hi>French</hi> Army was about Muſquet-ſhot in the
Rear of us, where they came to halt, and never moved off of
their Ground. The reſt of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army, ſeeing the Right
Wing carried away, and the Engliſh Colours flying over their
Heads, wheeled about in as good Order as they could, ſo that
we had the whole <hi>Spaniſh Army</hi> before us: and <hi>Major-General
Morgan</hi> called out to the <hi>Colonels, To the right as much as you can,</hi>
that ſo we might have all the Enemy's Army under the <hi>Engliſh
Colours.</hi> The Six Thouſand <hi>Engliſh</hi> carried all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army,
as far as <hi>Weſtminſter-Abby</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Church-yard,</hi> before ever a
<hi>French-man</hi> came in, on either Wing of us; but then at laſt we
could perceive the <hi>French Horſe</hi> come powdring on each Wing,
with much Gallantry, but they never ſtruck one ſtroke, only carried
Priſoners back to the Camp. Neither did we ever ſee the <hi>Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour
Lockart,</hi> till we were in purſute of the Enemy, and then
we could ſee him amongſt us very brisk, without his white Cap
on his Head, and neither troubled with Gravel or Stone.
When we were at the end of the purſute, <hi>Mareſchal Turenne,</hi> and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101904:8"/>
above a Hundred <hi>Officers</hi> of the Army came up to us, quitted
their Horſes, embrac'd the <hi>Officers,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>They never ſaw a
more Glorious Action in their Lives, and that they were ſo tranſported
with the Sight of it, that they had no Power to move, or to do any thing.</hi>
And this high Complement we had for our Pains. In a word,
the <hi>French Army</hi> did not ſtrike one Stroke in the Battle of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk,</hi>
only the Six Thouſand <hi>Engliſh.</hi> After we had done pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
the Enemy, <hi>Major-General Morgan,</hi> rallied his Forces,
and marched over the Sands where he had ſhock'd them at firſt,
to ſee what Slaughter there was made. But <hi>Embaſſadour Lockhart</hi>
went into the Camp as faſt as he could, to write his Letters for
<hi>England,</hi> of what great Service he had done, which was <hi>just
nothing. Mareſchal Turenne,</hi> and <hi>Major-General Morgan,</hi> brought
the Armies cloſe to inveſt <hi>Dunkirk</hi> again, and to carry on the
Approaches. The <hi>Marquis de Leida</hi> happened to be in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp,
and received an accidental Shot, whereof he died;
and the whole Garriſon, being diſcouraged at his Death, came
to Capitulate in few Days;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dunkirk</hi> taken.</note> ſo the Town was ſurrendred, and
<hi>Embaſſadour Lockhart</hi> march'd into it with two Regiments of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
for a Garriſon; but <hi>Major-General Morgan</hi> kept the Field,
with <hi>Mareſchal Turenne,</hi> with his other four Regiments of <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Seige was <hi>Bergen St. Winock,</hi> ſix Miles from <hi>Dunkirk,</hi>
which <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> beleaguer'd with the <hi>French Army,</hi> and
the four Regiments of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and in four or five Days Siege,
<hi>Bergen St. Winock</hi> was taken upon Capitulation. <hi>Mareſchal Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
did reſt the Army for two Days after, and then reſolv'd
to march through the Heart of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and take what Towns
he could that <hi>Campagn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Town we took was <hi>Furnes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">ſeveral Towns taken.</note> the next <hi>Menin,</hi> after
that <hi>Oudenard;</hi> and, in a word, eight Towns, beſides <hi>Dunkirk,</hi>
and <hi>Ipres;</hi> for ſo ſoon as the Redcoats came near the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp,
there was nothing but a Capitulation, and a Surrender
preſently: All the Towns we took, were Towns of Strength.</p>
            <p>The laſt Siege we made, was before the City of <hi>Ipres,</hi> where
the <hi>Prince de Ligny</hi> had caſt himſelf in before,<note place="margin">The Siege of <hi>Ipres.</hi>
               </note> for the Defence
of that City, with two Thouſand five hundred Horſe and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons:
Beſides there were in the City, four Thouſand Burghers,
all proper young Men under their Arms, ſo that the Garriſon,
did conſiſt of ſix Thouſand five Hundred Men. <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi>
ſent in a Summons, which was anſwered with a Defiance: Then
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101904:8"/>
               <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> broke Ground, and carried on two Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
towards the Counterſcarp: <hi>Major-General Morgan</hi> went into
the Approaches every Night, for fear of any Miſcarriage by the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and came out of the Approaches every Morning at Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing
to take his Reſt, for then the Soldiers had done Working.
The fourth Morning, <hi>Major-General Morgan</hi> went to take his
Reſt in his Tent, but within half an hour afterwards <hi>Mareſchal
Turenne</hi> ſent a Nobleman to him, to deſire him to come to ſpeak
with him; when the <hi>Major-General</hi> came, there were above a
Hundred Noblemen and Officers of the Army walking about
his Tent. And his Gentlemen had deck'd a Room for his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi>
with his Sumpter-cloaths, in which homely Place there
were about twenty Officers of the Army with him; but as
ſoon as <hi>Major-General Morgan</hi> came, <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> deſired all
of them to retire, for he had ſomething to Communicate to the
<hi>Major-General.</hi> The Room was immediately cleared, and <hi>Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
Turenne</hi> turn'd the Gentlemen of his Chamber out, and ſhut
the Door himſelf. When this was done, he deſired the <hi>Major-General</hi>
to ſit down by him, and the firſt News that he ſpake of,
was that he had certain Intelligence, that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi>
and <hi>Don Juan of Auſtria,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Don Juan</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> coming to relieve it.</note> were at the Head of eleven Thouſand
Horſe, and four Thouſand Foot, within three Leagues of his
Camp, and reſolv'd to break through one of our Quarters, to
Relieve the City of <hi>Ipres,</hi> and therefore he deſired <hi>Major-Meneral
Morgan,</hi> to have all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> under their Arms every Night at
Sun-ſet, and the <hi>French Army</hi> ſhould be ſo likewiſe. <hi>Major-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Morgan</hi> reply'd, and ſaid, <q>
                  <hi>That the</hi> Prince of Conde, <hi>and</hi>
Don Juan of Auſtria <hi>were great Captains, and that they might
dodge with</hi> Mareſchal Turenne <hi>to fatigate his Army:</hi> The <hi>Major-General</hi>
farther ſaid, <hi>That if he did keep the Army three Nights to
that hard Shift, they would not care who did knock them on the Head.</hi>
               </q>
               <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> reply'd, <q>
                  <hi>We must do it, and ſurmount all
Difficulty.</hi>
               </q> The <hi>Major-General</hi> deſired to know of his Excellency,
<hi>whether he was certain the Enemy was ſo near him;</hi> he anſwered, <hi>He
had two Spies came just from them.</hi> Then <hi>Major-General Morgan</hi> told
him, his Condition was ſomewhat deſperate, and ſaid, <hi>that a
deſperate Diſeaſe must have a deſperate Cure.</hi> His Excellency ask'd,
what he meant; <hi>Major-General Morgan</hi> did offer him, to attempt
the Counterſcarp upon an Aſſault, and ſo put all things out of
doubt, with Expedition. <hi>The Major-General</hi> had no ſooner ſaid
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101904:9"/>
this, but <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> joyn'd his Hands, and look'd up
through the Boards towards the Heavens, and ſaid, <q>
                  <hi>Did ever
my Maſter, the</hi> King <hi>of</hi> France, <hi>or the</hi> King <hi>of</hi> Spain, <hi>attempt a
Counterſcarp upon an Aſſault, where there were three Half-moons co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Cannon, and the Ramparts of the Towns playing point
blank into the Counterſcarp:</hi>
               </q> farther he ſaid, <q>
                  <hi>What will the</hi> King <hi>my
Maſter think of me, if I expoſe his Army to theſe Hazards?</hi>
               </q> and he
roſe up, and fell into a Paſſion, ſtamping with his Feet, and
ſhaking his Locks, and grinning with his Teeth, he ſaid, <hi>Major-General
Morgan</hi> had made him Mad. But by degrees he cool'd,
and asked the <hi>Major-General,</hi> whether he would ſtay to Dinner
with him: But the <hi>Major-General</hi> begg'd his Pardon, for he had
appointed ſome of the Officers to Eat a piece of Beef at his
Tent that Day. His <hi>Excellency</hi> ask'd him, <hi>if he would meet him
at two of the Clock, at the oppening of the Approaches?</hi> The <hi>Major-General</hi>
ſaid he would be Punctual; but deſired he would bring
none of his Train with him (for it was uſually a hundred No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
with their Feathers and Ribbands) becauſe if he did, he
would have no Opportunity to take a View of the Counterſcarp;
for the Enemy would diſcover them, and Fire unceſſantly. His
<hi>Excellency</hi> ſaid he would bring none, but two or three of the
<hi>Leiutenant-Generals. Major-General Morgan</hi> was at the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
a quarter of an hour before his <hi>Excellency,</hi> and then
his Excellency came, with eight <hi>Noblemen,</hi> and three <hi>Leiutenant-Generals,</hi>
and took a place to view the Counterſcarp: After he
had look'd a conſiderable time upon it, he turned about, and
look'd upon the <hi>Noblemen</hi> and <hi>Lieutenant-Generals,</hi> and ſaid, <q>
                  <hi>I
don't know what to ſay to you, here is</hi> Major-General Morgan <hi>has
put me out of my Wits, for he would have me attempt yonder Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarp
upon an Aſſault.</hi>
               </q> None of the <hi>Noblemen</hi> or <hi>Lieutenants</hi>
made any Reply to him, but <hi>Count Schomberg,</hi> ſaying, <q>
                  <hi>My Lord,
I think</hi> Major-General Morgan <hi>would offer nothing to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
but what he thinks feaſible, and he knows he has good fighting
Men.</hi>
               </q> Upon this <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> ask'd <hi>Major-General Morgan,</hi>
how many <hi>Engliſh</hi> he would venture. <hi>The Major-General</hi> ſaid,
that he would venture ſix Hundred common Men, beſides
Officers, and fifty Pioneers. <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> ſaid, that ſix
Hundred of <hi>Mounſieur la Farty</hi>'s Army and fifty Pioneers, and ſix
Hundred of his own Army and fifty Pioneers more, would make
better then two Thouſand Men: <hi>Major-General Morgan</hi> reply'd,
<q>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:101904:9"/>
                  <hi>They were abundance to carry it with God's Aſſiſtance.</hi>
               </q> Then his
<hi>Excellence</hi> ſaid, he would acquaint the King and his <hi>Eminence,</hi> that
Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> had put him upon that deſperate Deſign;
Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> deſired his Pardon, for it was in his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to attempt it, or not to attempt it: But in the cloſe, Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
<hi>Turenne</hi> ſaid to the Major-General, that he muſt fall into
<hi>Monſieur la Ferte</hi>'s Approaches, and that he ſhould take the one
half of <hi>Monſieur la Ferte</hi>'s Men, and that he would take the other
half into his own Approaches. Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> begg'd
his Pardon, and ſaid he deſired to fall on with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> entire
by themſelves, without intermingling them. Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi>
reply'd, he muſt fall on, cut of one of the Approaches: The
Major-General reply'd, that he would fall on in the Plain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
both Approaches. His <hi>Excellency</hi> ſaid, that he would
never be able to endure their Firing, but that they would kill
half his Men before he could come to the Counterſcarp; the
Major-General ſaid, that he had an Invention that the Enemy
ſhould not percieve him, till he had his Hands upon the Stocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does.
Next his <hi>Excellency</hi> ſaid, for the Signal, there ſhall be a
Captain of <hi>Monſieur la Ferte</hi>'s with twenty Firelocks, ſhall leap
upon the Point, and cry, <q>
                  <hi>Sa ſa vive le Roy de France;</hi>
               </q> and upon
that noiſe, all were to fall on together. But Major-General
<hi>Morgan</hi> oppos'd that Signal, ſaying, the Enemy would thereby
be allarm'd, and then he ſhould hardly endure their Firing. His
<hi>Excellency</hi> reply'd then, that he would give no Signal at all, but
the Major-General ſhould give it, and he would not be perſuaded
otherwiſe. Then the Major-General deſired his <hi>Excellency,</hi> that
he would give order to them in the Approaches, to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in readineſs againſt Sunſet, for at the ſhutting of the Night
he would fall on: he likewiſe deſired his <hi>Excellency</hi> that he would
Order a Major out of his own Approaches, and another out of
Monſ. <hi>la Ferte</hi>'s Approaches to ſtand by him, and when he ſhould
be ready to fall on, he would diſpatch the two Majors into each
of the Approaches, that they might be ready to leap out, when
the Major-General paſſed between the two Approaches, with the
commanded <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Juſt at Sunſet Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and told the Major-General, he might fall on when he ſaw
his own time. The Major-General reply'd, he would fall on
juſt at the ſetting of the Night, and when the dusk of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
came on. The Major-General made the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſtand to their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101904:10"/>
Arms, and divided them into Bodies; a Captain at the Head of
the Pioneers, and the Major-General and a Collonel, at the Head
of the two Battallions; he ordered the two Battallions, and the
Pioneers, each Man to take up a long Faſcine upon their Muſquets
and Pikes, and then they were three ſmall Groves of Wood. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
the Major-General commanded the two Majors to go
to their Approaches, and that they ſhould leap out, ſo ſoon as
they ſhould ſee the Major-General march between their Approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
The Major-General did order the two Battallions, that when
they came within threeſcore of the Stockadoes, to ſlip their Faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
and fall on. But ſo it happened, that the <hi>French</hi> never mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
out of their Approaches,<note place="margin">The Storming of <hi>Ipre.</hi>
               </note> till ſuch time as M. G. <hi>Morgan</hi> had
overpowered the Enemy. When the Pioneers came within ſight of
the Stockadoes, they ſlipp'd the Faſcines down and fell on; the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-General,
and the other two Battallions were cloſe to them,
and when the Soldiers began to lay their Hands on the Stocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,
they tore them down for the length of ſixſcore, and leap'd
Pell-mell into the Counterſcarp amongſt the Enemy; abundance
of the Enemy were drown'd in the Moat,<note place="margin">The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarp taken by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</hi>
               </note> and many taken Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
with two <hi>German Princes,</hi> and the Counterſcarp clear'd;
the <hi>French</hi> were in their Approaches all this time: then the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
fell on upon the half-Moons, and immediately the Redcoats
were on the top of them, throwing the Enemy into the Moat, and
turning the Cannon upon the Town, thus the two half-Moons
were ſpeedily taken: after the Manning of the half-Moons he
did rally all the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with intention to lodge them upon the
Counterſcarp, that he might be free of the Enemies Shot the next
Morning; and they left the other half-Moon for Mareſchal
<hi>Turenne</hi>'s Party, which was even before their Approaches.</p>
            <p>Then the <hi>French</hi> fell on upon the other half-Moon,<note place="margin">The <hi>French</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd.</note> but were
beaten off. The Major-General conſidered, that that half-Moon
would gall him in the day-time, and therefore did ſpeak to the
Officers and Soldiers, that it was beſt to give them a little help;
the Redcoats cry'd, <hi>Shall we fall on in Order, or Happy-go-lucky?</hi> The
Major-General ſaid, <hi>In the Name of God, at it Happy-go-lucky;</hi> and
immediately the Redcoats fell on, and were on the top of it,
knocking the Enemy down, and caſting them into the Moat.
When this Work was done, the <hi>Major-General</hi> lodg'd the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
on the Counterſcarp; they were no ſooner lodg'd, but <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſchal
Turenne</hi> ſcrambled over the Ditches, to find out the <hi>Major-General,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:101904:10"/>
and when he met with him, he was much troubled the
<hi>French</hi> did no better, for indeed they did juſt nothing: Then his
Excellency ask'd the <hi>Major-General,</hi> to go to his Approaches to
Refreſh himſelf, but the <hi>Major-General</hi> begg'd his Pardon, and
ſaid, <hi>he would not ſtir from his Poſt, till he heard a Drum beat a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
and ſaw a white Flag over the Walls.</hi> Upon that <hi>Mareſchal Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>
laught and ſmil'd, and ſaid, <hi>they would not be at that paſs in
ſix Days,</hi> and then went to his Approaches, and ſent the <hi>Major-General</hi>
three or four dozen bottles of rare Wine, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
diſhes of cold Meats,<note place="margin">The Town beat a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</note> and Sweet-meats. Within two hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Sun-riſing, a Drum beat a Parley, and a white Flat was ſeen
over the Walls. The <hi>Major-General</hi> ordered a Lieutenant with
a file of Muſquetiers, to go and receive the Drummer, and to
Blindfold him, and carry him ſtreight to <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> in
his Approaches. <hi>Mareſchal Turenne</hi> came immediately with the
Drummer's Meſſage to the <hi>Major-Teneral,</hi> and was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
he would not receive the Meſſage before it came to him. The
<hi>Major-General</hi> reply'd, that that was very improper, his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
being upon the place. The Meſſage was to this effect, <q>
                  <hi>That
whereas his Excellency had offered them honourable Terms in his Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
they were now willing to accept of them, provided they might
have their Charter, and the Priviledges of the City preſerved: That
they had appointed four of their Commiſſioners, to treat farther with
four Commiſſioners from his Excellency.</hi>
               </q> Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> was
pleas'd to ask the <hi>Major-General,</hi> whether he would be one of the
Commiſſioners, but the <hi>Major-General</hi> begg'd his Pardon, and
deſired that he might abide at his Poſt, till ſuch time as the City
was Surrendered up. Immediately then his Excellency ſent for
<hi>Count Schomberg,</hi> and three other Commiſſioners, and gave them
Inſtructions how to treat with the four Commiſſioners from the
Enemy. Juſt as Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> was giving the Commiſſioners
Inſtructions, Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> ſaid, <hi>that the Enemy were
Hungry, ſo that they would eat any Meat they could have;</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Excellency ſmil'd, and ſhortn'd their Inſtructions, and
ſent them away. Within half an hour, the Commiſſioners had
concluded, <hi>that they Should have their City Charter preſerv'd, and that
they were to receive a</hi> French <hi>Garriſon in,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</note> 
               <hi>and the Prince</hi> de Ligny <hi>was
to march out with all his Forces next Morning at nine of the Clock,
with one Piece of Cannon, Colours Flying, Bullet in Mouth, and Match
Lighted at both ends, and to have a Convoy to Conduct him into his own
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101904:11"/>
Territories.</hi> Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> was in the Morning betimes with
ſeveral Noblemen and Officers of the Army, and Major-General
<hi>Morgan</hi> attending near the Gate, for the Prince <hi>de Ligny</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out. The Prince having Notice that Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> was
there, came out of his Coach. Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> being alighted
off from his Horſe, and Major-General <hi>Morgan,</hi> at both their
meeting there was a great Acclamation, and Embracing one
another. After a little time, Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> told the Prince,
he very much admired that he would expoſe his Perſon to a
Garriſon before a Conquering Army: The Prince <hi>de Ligny</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
<hi>that if Mareſchal</hi> Turenne <hi>had left his</hi> Engliſh <hi>in</hi> England, <hi>he
durſt have expos'd his Perſon into the weakest Garriſon, the King
of</hi> Spain <hi>had in</hi> Flanders;<note place="margin">The Town delivered.</note> and ſo they parted, and his Excellency
march'd into the Town with a <hi>French</hi> Garriſon, and the Major-General
with him. So ſoon as the Garriſon was ſettled,
Mareſchal <hi>Turenne</hi> writ his Letters to the <hi>French</hi> King, and his
Eminence the Cardinal, how that the City of <hi>Ipres</hi> was reduc'd
to the Obedience of his Majeſty, and that he was poſſeſs'd of it,
and that Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> was Inſtrumental in that Service,
and that the <hi>Engliſh did wonders,</hi> and ſent the Intendant of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
with his Letters to the King and Cardinal. Monſieur <hi>Tallon</hi>
the Intendant return'd back from the King and Cardinal to
the Army within eight Days, and brought a Complement to
Major-General <hi>Morgan,</hi> that the King and his Eminence the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
did expect to ſee him at <hi>Paris,</hi> when he came to his Winter-Quarters,
where there would be a Cupboard of Plate to attend
him. Major-General <hi>Morgan,</hi> inſtead of going for his Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
of Plate, went for <hi>England,</hi> and his Majeſty of <hi>France</hi>
had never the Kindneſs to ſend him his Cupboard of Plate: So
that this is the Reward that Major-General <hi>Morgan</hi> hath had
from the <hi>French</hi> King for all his Service in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
