         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Thus men liue, and thus they die in the most fearefull state of eternall death: the which thing being duely weighed, would worke griefe euen in the hardest heart, and stirre it vp to a pittifull desire of amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it.

<pb facs="tcp:26956:4"/>
means. For as touching the corruption of nature, the which, wee confesse maketh it impossible for a man to renew himfelf, God is not in any wise to be thought the author of it: for he created man in perfect holines, but man did carelesly &amp; wilfully loose that holines, which God gaue vnto him. But as for the neglect and contempt of the means, which God hath appointed for the recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of holines, man can not but take that wholly to himself, who although he cannot renew himself thogh he wold, yet if he will hee may vse the meanes appointed for that purpose, as will more plainly appeare in the particulars. But ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who (for <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                     </hi> most part) is carelesse of eternall saluation, yea altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnwilling to take that paines in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, which is required of all those, who desire to finde it, will alledge in defence of this his wilfull contempt of Gods word, that it were folly for him to seeke regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the which it is not in his power to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. VVhereunto we answer, that no man ought to despaire of the truth, goodnesse, mercie or power of God, and make his


<pb facs="tcp:26956:5"/>
sinfulnesse the greater, and his damnation the more iust and grieuous: but rather doe his endeuour in the carefull and continuall vse of the means, as God hath commanded, and so leaue both the successe of his labour, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is not gold or siluer, (although <hi>Simon Magus</hi> supposed, that spirituall graces might be bought with money, as worldly commodities are) that can purchase regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, not fauour, friendship, or any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert of holinesse, but onely the vsing of the meanes which God hath appointed.</p>
                  <p>The meanes of Regeneration, is the way leading vnto it, called in Scripture <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> in the Greek tong <hi>Metanoia,</hi> that is, an after minde, or a right mind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a wrong minde: for as in other matters it commeth daily to passe, that men being in processe of time brought by experience to

wherein he seldome or neuer thinketh of God (whom perhaps he thinketh neither to exist in him selfe, nor to worke any way in the world): or of his owne saluation, he neuer dreaming of any other world, then this which hee doth presently enioy, and wherein hee placeth his whole happinesse. In this first estate (which may truely bee called <hi>Atheisme</hi>) man is most wretched as in all other respectes, so chiefely, in that he accounting him selfe happy (as all car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men doe who are free from outward crosses) is for the present without any kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ledge, desire, hope, or likelyhood of any better estate. In the second estate also (the which in this Treatise wee call the state of <hi>Repentance)</hi> man is as yet not happy but miserable: yet happy in this one respect, for that he knowing himselfe to be wretched, doth earnestly desire, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endeuour, and may well hope to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come happy. But in the third estate, to wit, in regeneration, he knoweth him selfe to be both happy and holy, and laboreth for the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of it, &amp; by vertue of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse


<pb facs="tcp:26956:6"/>
which he hath receiued from God, to ouercome that sinfulnesse which he hath by nature. The second state, is the way leading from the first to the third, from sinne to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, from death to life, the conuersion of a sinner, not to God (for he is as yet as farre from him, as hell, or rather as the earth is from Heauen) but onely towardes God, and the preparation for grace and regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, commaunded vnto vs by the name of <hi>Repentance.</hi> Thus the ministery of <hi>Iohn</hi> was the ministery of Repentance, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, not so much to teach Christ and the doctrine of the Gospell, or to worke faith, as by preaching the doctrine of the Law, to bring men to a sight and sense of sinne, that so they might be stirred vppe to Christ the pardoner of sinne. Thus he defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his office and ministery, Math. <hi>3.3. The voice of a Crier in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, prepare the waie of the Lord, and make his pathes straight.</hi> And this was the summe of all his Sermons, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, for the kingdome of Heauen is at hand.</hi> Likewise, in other places of


<pb facs="tcp:26956:7"/>
Scripture, the word <hi>Repentance</hi> is thus taken: alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ough sometimes put for Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or sanctification it selfe, yet vsually distinguished from it, as being but a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue vnto it. As Math. <hi>21.32. You did not repent to beleeue.</hi> Or, that so you might haue beleeued: and Act. <hi>2.38. Repent and be baptized for remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinne, and yee shall receiue the gift of the holy Ghost,</hi> and Act. <hi>8.22. Peter</hi> saith to <hi>Simon Magus, Repent, and pray to God, if perhaps the thought of thy heart may bee forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thee.</hi> And thus we take it in this Treatise for the naturall conuersion of a man to God, wrought in a man vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, (as it seemeth <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was, <hi>Iohn 3.4.</hi> although he did seeke saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) yet being the meanes of regeneration.</p>
                  <p>This way or this ladder, whereby we are to clime vp to regeneration, hath foure steps, for so we will make a homely and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar diuision of it, that it being set down in many seuerall partes, may the more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be vnderstood and knowen. The first step


<pb facs="tcp:26956:7"/>
which is to be made by this carnal man now repenting, is to get the true knowledge of his o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>is present. The second step is humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation or contrition, wrought in him by the due consideration of his own estate. The third, is a full purpose or resolution of mind to seeke for grace and regeneration. The fourth and last part, is the diligent vsing of the meanes appointed by God, for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of grace: the which meanes are three in number. The first is amendment of life: the second, the hearing of Gods word: the third is praier, or inuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the name of God.</p>

And therefore we must endeuour in the first place to bring this our <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to know himselfe, to wit, how he standeth in respect of God and his fauour, whereon his good estate doth

For as the good estate of a subiect or seruant consisteth in this, that he liuing in the fauour and good liking of his king, or maister, procured by his loial obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience &amp; faithful seruice, is free fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al euils and iniuries, and enioieth all things either needfull, or pleasant: so the state of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pure from sin, is good &amp; happie: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, if by sinning, &amp; rebelling against god, he incur his displeasure, most wretched &amp; miserable.

Yea, in the soule of man, nothing is so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to man himself, as that which both of it selfe, and to all others is most appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and conspicuous, as are the spots in a mans face, to wit, the wants, infirmities, and enormities of it.

And therefore, as Philosophers, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that men are altogither ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of their owne faults and vices, set this precept&amp; <hi>Nosce seipsum,</hi> in the beginning of their morall institutions: so the first lesson, which a diuine is to teach, and a Christian to learn is this, know, and acknowledge the sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of thy soule, wherof, of thy selfe thou

And surely so it is: for although the soule of man bee so wholy infected with the leprosie of sinne, that there is no cleane part or piece from the top to the toe of it, yet it seemeth to it selfe most pure, beautifull and glorious, as by the receiued opinions of perfect inhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t righteousnesse, iustification by works, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, of pure naturals &amp; free will, doth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare. <hi>Reuel.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Thou sayest I am rich, and am enriched,</hi> (the one by nature, the other by freewil and industry) <hi>and haue need of nothing, and knowest not that thou art wretched, miserable, poore, blinde and naked.</hi> These are the opinions, &amp; conceits which al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue of themselues, thinking far better of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in euery respect the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they shuld do: yea, the errors before named, as they are natural to man, so they haue place co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly in most, if not generally in all carnall men, who, howsoeuer perhaps for co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions sake they make profession of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In the which examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there must great care be had, that we bee not blinded by any meanes, and so made corrupt iudges, as namely by an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion and conceit of our own good parts,

of nature, our vertues gotten by good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and industrie, our good works which we haue done to God, and to our brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, how many waies, and with how great charges we haue maintained learning, set forward religion, serued God, and releeued the poore. These conceits, if they runne in our heades, they will blinde our eyes, and so ouershadow all our sinnes, that wee shal iudge and pronounce our selues not sinfull, but holy, iust, and innocent. And then especially this commeth to passe, when as we compare our selues with those who are more sinfull, and in some respect notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously wicked: then the opinion of our owne holinesse, which before was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, is put out of all controuersie, and wee not onely exempted from the ranke and state of sinfull men, but euen canonized Saints in our owne conceits.

But this mischieuous errour, by the which many mens repentance is nipt in the head &amp; broken off in the beginning, must be remoued, by knowing and considering, that other mens sins will condemne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but cannot iustifie vs, that in sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes we are as far &amp; further beyond others, then we are short of them, and that our good deeds though neuer so many &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, comming from the corrupt fountain of an irrepentant and vnbeleeuing heart, are accounted sinnes before God, as the scripture teacheth vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.23. yea, as defiled and filthie clouts, loathsome and abhominable in his sight. And further, that they comming (as our owne consciences knowfull well, and as others haue suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ground to suspect) not from any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of loue, either to God or man, but from selfe-loue, pride, and vaine glorie, we intending &amp; desiring nothing but onely to purchase vnto our selues credit &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the world, deserue not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, but to be abhorred euen of men.</p>
                        <p>This fight of sin consisteth in knowing two things. First our selues to be so sinfull as we are indeed, seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, that in regard of our sin we are vnrighteous in the sight of God. Mans sinfulnes is this, that wheras he


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:26956:13"/>
ought by the lawe of God to be holy and pure in nature, soule and bodie, hee is in all these respects wholly corrupted &amp; defiled with sin. His natural sinfulnes consisteth in this, that he is of himself by nature, without any outward tentation, allurement, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, inclined to euill, &amp; altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to do good. The inward sinfulnesse of the soule is, in that all the secret motions of it, which should be onely toward God, and the doing of that which is agreeable to his law, are altogether from Godward, and toward sin and disobedience. These (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer some thinke &amp; teach them to be no sins) yet God doth account otherwise of them, &amp; so must this our repentant do. For why? as god is a spirit, so he wil be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and serued not onely outwardly in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily actions, but also inwardly in the spirit and soule: and abhorreth the secret filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the soule, as much as the outward and apparant filthinesse of the bodie, the one being as apparant &amp; manifest to him as the other.

the perfitnesse, number, excellencie, and merite of them, but rather thinke &amp; know that as sauory water cannot come from a stinking puddle, or sweete fruit from a sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er roote, no more can any one good worke come from an vnregenerate man, from a corrupt and sinfull soule, who although he giue his bodie to the fire for the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and maintenance of the truth, and all his goods to the poore, in a tender compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their miserie, yet hee being desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of faith, loue, &amp; the rest of the parts of regeneration, dooth not by these workes please God, or fulfill his lawe. For that, where they are fewe and seldome perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, they should bee continuall, where they should be done onely for Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they are done onely in vaine glory, and in desire of the applause of men, or which is worse, in a presumpteous opinion of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting saluation at the hands of God, if not in hypocrisie or in some euill and wicked intent. How much lesse then can we think that our vnlawfull actions forbidden and condemned by the law and word of God, are any way veniall or iustifiable. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the sight of sinne, is to know, that by it we are made vniust and vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, not onely by a sinfull and wicked

For hee that breaketh any one of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by any meanes, breaketh the whole law, and is as guiltie of sin, as he who brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all the commandements. So that, to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude this point, this our <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring to repent, and so to be sanctified and saued, must in the first place learne vvhat sinne is, how many kinds, differences, and degrees are of it, yea, all the doctrine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this head, and secondly so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie it to himselfe and his owne estate, as that hee make it as a glasse wherein to see and know himselfe to be sinfull.</p>

of sinne, which is the second part of it. By the sense of sinne, wee meane the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that punishment, which is due vnto him for his sin: For most men make so little account of sinne, that although they know in their owne consciences, and will not sticke to confesse to others, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be both sinfull by nature, and sinners in the whole course of their liues: yet their sinnes are not a heauie burden or a clog vnto their consciences, not as sharpe pricks wounding and galling their hearts, but as small and light matters wherof they haue no sense or feeling: they thinke that as they themselues, so also God himselfe maketh small reckoning of it, and though he haue commanded men to liue in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his law, and to abstaine from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of sin, yet he is not by the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it prouoked to anger, or to inflict any punishment vppon the offendant, as plainely appeareth by that great patience which he vseth towards men, who although generally they go on in al maner of disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and wilful breaking of his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, adding one greeuous sinne to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and open contempt of him, &amp; of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that as the water is deepest, where it is the stillest: so where God is most silent in threatning, and patient in sparing, there he is most inflamed with anger, and purpose of reuenge: and lastly, that the fewer iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are poured foorth vpon the wicked in this life, the mo are reserued in store for them in the life to come.

                        <p>This part of repentance (as also all the rest) is vsually wanting in carnall men, who passe on their daye in mirth, pleasure, and securitie, and so blessing themselues in their prosperous estate, put farre from themselues the euill day: yet sometimes it may be found in them, vppon occasion ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of some hainous sinne committed, or some great crosse or miserie sustained. For the first, lesse sinnes do not trouble mens consciences, or worke in them these ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:26956:17"/>
of horror and desperation: for men see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted daily, both by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues, and also by others, without anie punishment, make no reckoning of them. But as for hainous and extraordinarie sins, as murther, incest, adulterie, oppression, and such others, which all men condemne, and fewe commit, these are not so easely swalowed ouer, but do often leaue behinde them a pricke in the conscience, and feare of punishment. But especially this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, when as togither with anie such sin, some outward misery doth concur, the which will easely put a man in mind of his sinne, and in feare of further punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: hereof it commeth that this sense of Gods wrath due to sinne, is oftnest seene in the tyme of some daungerous sickenesse threatning death, in the which manie are brought to see and acknowledge, both their sinne, and the desert of it, who as long as they enioyed their health, liued in sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse securitie, and Atheisme.

                        <p>THe last thing, which this repentant is to learne, and knowe, as touching his owne estate, is this, howe vnable hee is of himselfe, or by any meanes which hee can vse, to free himselfe, eyther from his sinne, or from the anger of GOD due vnto it For there is no condition so mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, but that the hope of amending it (if there bee anie) will asswage the paine and griefe of it. But in this case, there is no hope, and therefore no comfort left to man, to whom it is altogither impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, if hee respect himselfe, or any thing that any creature can do in his behalfe, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to shake off his naturall sinfulnesse, or to escape the punishment of eternall death belonging vnto it. For the former of these two, a carnall man may foster in his minde what conceytes hee will of his


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:26956:18"/>
owne excellencie and naturall strength, supposing himselfe to bee, although per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps for the present, both outwardly wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and inwardly sinfull, outwardly fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and inwardly vncleane, yet able at his own pleasure to purge himself both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the naturall corruption and from the outward act of sin: but the truth of Gods word tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the contrarie, to wit, that sin being by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> made naturall to man, cleaueth vnto him as vnseparably, as the skin doth to his body, and as the spots to the skin of the leopard, which hauing their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall in the bones, marrow and most secret parts, cannot by any force or deuise be gotten out. He may indeede by his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall strength represse the rage of it: hee may prune and loppe it, cutting off the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous boughes and branches of it, yet the roote, yea, the whole bodie of it will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnmoueable in the secret parts of his soule, &amp; send forth plentifull fruit in all the parts and members of his bodie at one time or other, as occasion is offered, as hath beene declared more at large else where. Likewise, for the punishment due vnto sinne, that can no way bee auoyded, not by hiding our selues in some secret place from God, for whether shall wee go


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:26956:18"/>
from his presence who is euery where? hee is in heauen, and in hel, in the towne, and in the desart, he seeth as well at midnight, as at noon day. <hi>Psa.</hi> 139.

But we hope perhaps to escape punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, yea, though we cannot eschew his presence, &amp; that by meanes of the great mercy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencie of God, who delighteth not in the misery, anguish, and confusion of men, but in their saluation and happie estate, and therefore will no doubt bee easely entreated by the humble sute and pittifull mone of men, to pardon their sinnes, and if not to bestowe vppon them the crowne of eternall glorie, they hauing not deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it, yet to remitte the punishment due vnto their sinnes. Thus doo many men imagine of God, and thus they imagin him not to bee God, who as hee is mercifull, so also he is iust: yea, hee is as iust as hee is mercifull, being in both respectes infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and therefore equall. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is no lesse impossible that GGD


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:26956:19"/>
should remitte the punishment due vnto sinne, then that he should do that which is contrarie to his owne nature. If it be here asked, how then doth God shew mercie on the elect: we answer, that he doth it not by remitting the punishment of their sin, but by taking it vpon himselfe, euen by puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing their sin in his owne person: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no hope of impunitie left for the carnall man, but a fearfull expectation of wrath, the which although perhaps it bee in part deferred for a time, yet assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the day of iudgement, and of vengeance will come at length. Thus we haue brought this vnregenerate man to the sight or true knowledge of himselfe, and of his owne estate, to wit, the knowledge first of his sinfulnesse: secondly, of the punishment due vnto his sinne: and thirdly, of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, or inabilitie, of mending this his euill estate. This is the first part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and may fitly bee called by the name of the whole, to wit, Repenting, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking, or rather after thinking, and an after minde. For, in steade of that fonde conceate, which he had of his owne puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, righteousnesse, and happinesse, he now seeth himselfe to be sinfull, guiltie of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death, and subiect to all maner of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:26956:19"/>

The first ariseth of the due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the filthy and loathsome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of sinne: for as <hi>Adam</hi> by comming out of the state of holinesse, into the state of sin had his eies opened to see the filthinesse of sinne. and his owne nakednesse, whervpon he being ashamed, desired to hide and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himselfe: so a carnall man comming out of the state of senselesse securitie, wherein he neither knoweth nor considereth what sin is, into this state of repentance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he conceiueth of sinne, as it is in deede, iudgeth himselfe in regarde of it, the most abiect man of all other, vnworthy of their companie, or to come in their sight: and therefore he declineth it, wherein this shame doth consist. Yea, when as this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation is vehement, he iudgeth himselfe the most vile creature on the earth, the most grieuous sinner that euer liued, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be no such cause, hee hauing liued as orderly, &amp; honestly, as vsually men do. For now he hath his eies fully bent vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his owne sinnes, he hath fresh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them, and of all the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:26956:20"/>
aggrauating the hainousnesse of them, and knoweth the particulars of them, the which hee dooth not in other mens sinnes. This shame is not so proper and necessarie a part of humiliation, as are the other affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of sorrowe and feare, for that it hath place in those onely, who before their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance were giuen to great and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sinnes, such as are not vsually found in the liues of men, and therefore are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and condemned by all: as for ordinary sinnes, which may bee daily seene in men, and from the which few are free, they doo not worke this shame: for men are ashamed in regard of them onely, who are lesse sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and therfore more excellent then the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: yea, they are ashamed more in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of men, then of God, because the presence of men is sensible, whereas they ought to be so much the more ashamed in respect of God, and of his holy angels, as they are more excellent, pure, &amp; more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horring the filthinesse of sinne, then any man is or can be: as we knowe that <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eua</hi> were ashamed of their nakednesse, (or rather of their sinne, which made their nakednesse shamefull, which of it selfe was glorious) when as there were not any other men to see it. And therefore, howsoeuer


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:26956:21"/>
the Atheisme of men be so great, that they are not perswaded, and therefore not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the presence of God, yet all they who haue any dealing with God, or do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way seeke vnto him, must be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of their sins in respect of god then men: and yet to nourish this shamefastnes in regard of their brethren, as being good and profitable, for the more that they are humble towards men, the greater wil their humiliation be in respect of God.</p>
                     <p>The second part of inward humiliation is sorrow, which is a greeuous sense of some present euill, as feare is of some euill to come: both which affections cannot but be great and vehement in this repentant, for that his eyes being now at length ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hee seeth and feeleth himselfe to be in a most miserable estate, to bee for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in slauerie to sinne and Sathan, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether destitute of grace &amp; of al the means of attaining it, beside many temporall crosses wherewith hee is afflicted, and for the time to come in the very gnawes of the deuill, and in the vnquenchable furnace of the wrath of God.</p>
                     <p>It is not needefull that we should insiste in declaring how great and iust cause hee hath of sorrow &amp; feare: yea, rather it is not


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:26956:21"/>
possible for vs to declare it in any measure. If we suppose a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> liuing in health, wealth, and all maner of pleasure, to haue this of a sudden made knowne vnto him, that he is condemned of treason committed against his Prince and countrey, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee is forthwith to be depriued of life, and al those pleasures which he doth enioy, there being no hope of pardon which can not possibly be procured by himselfe or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, it depending wholly in the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fauor &amp; free inclination of the prince, who vseth to be greatly inflamed with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against al such offenders, &amp; not to spare one of a thousand of them: can wee fully conceiue in mind or expresse in word, the greatnesse of his greefe, sorrow, and feare? How much more greeuous and fearefull a thing shall wee then thinke it, to incur the displeasure of God, the losse of eternal ioy and happines, togither with those endlesse paines, which are prepared for the wicked. And therefore when as wee see men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and grone vnder this burthen of their sinnes and the anger of GOD, wee are not (as vsually men doo who haue no sense of these things) to iudge them as men subiect to foolish and melancholie passions, but rather to thinke and confesse


<pb n="28" facs="tcp:26956:22"/>
that there is good cause why they shoulde be thus affected. Yea, this repentant is to giue himselfe to the daily and serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of these things, that so this humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation which is of great vse, and verye needfull in regard of his saluation, may bee procured. For, as it is often needfull for the preseruation of the bodily life, that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient be by detraction of blood brought to a swowne, and so euen to deaths doore, so it is needfull for the procuring of this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall life of the soule, that the repentant be by sorrowe and feare cast down, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the gates of hell, as one forlorne, and being in a most wretched estate. Thus the apostle wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.8. <hi>I do not repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t me that I made you sorrowfull by an Epistle, yea, I am glad, not that ye were sorie, but that ye sorowed to repentance, not to be repented of: for worldly sorrow brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth death.</hi> But as this humiliation is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be procured, in regard of the great commodities which it bringeth, which are afterward to be declared: so it is to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated, least that it driue to desperation, as in the place before named he warneth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they doo not vse too great seueritie toward the incestuous person, least that he be swalowed vp of excessiue sorow.

And what maruaile is it, that a sinfull man, who in respect of the anger of God, is euen as hay, stubble, or flaxe, meeting with fire, bee soone ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and faint vnder this heauy burthen lying on his conscience, when as euen Christ himselfe, who in himselfe was free from sinne, and whose humane nature was vpheld by the Godhead, to beare the burthen of Gods wrath, due vnto the sinne of man, was by the sense of it so amazed, and confounded, that all the faculties, both of his bodie and soule, were shaken and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: as, for the one, those drops of blood which he swet, and for the other, those wordes vttered in humane weakenesse and feare, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken me</hi>? do plainly witnesse.

is it if in sinful men, it stir vp the very flame of hell fire: as to let all other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples passe, we reade of one <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> in whom wee may beholde the very pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that spirituall torment of a gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and terrifying conscience, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the wicked in the worlde to come. But it must bee preuented by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the midst of the view of our wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched estate, the other eye set on the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull promises of God, made as touching the pardon of sinne, whereof although this penitent cannot haue any assurance that they belong vnto him, in that hee feeleth not as yet grace wrought in his heart, which is the onely earnest penny &amp; pledge of saluation, and of the loue of GOD, yet hee may hope for it in time to come, it being like inough that GOD, who hath begunne this repentance in him, will also worke regeneration in his good time. And therefore there must in this case a meane be kept, so as wee be neither se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and senselesse in regarde of our sinnes and the wrath of GOD (much lesse puft vp in pride and vaine confidence, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our state to be good and happy, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is wofull and miserable) nor yet swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vppe of excessiue sorrow and feare,

                        <p>NOw further in this humiliation of a sinner, wee are to declare these two points: first whether it bee a worke of grace or of nature, and secondly whether it bee absolute necessitie for regeneration and saluation, or no. For the first, although it may seeme a worke of Gods spirit to haue a broken and a contrite heart, contrarie to that obstinacie, atheisme, and hardnesse of heart, which is in the wicked, yet it is a worke of nature, comming of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and euil, and that conscience of sinne, which remaineth in man since his creation. For wee are not to thinke that this humiliation is that true contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and softnesse of heart, which hath place


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:26956:24"/>
in those who are regenerate, and whereby they do easely without any resistance or delay, yeelde to the word and will of God, being at the first mooued by his promises &amp; blessings to loue him, by his threatnings and iudgements to feare him, and by both to obey him: onely it is a seruile feare of punishment and of the anger of GOD, wherewith obstinacie in sinne may easely and doth often concurre. But why, will some man say, if this humiliation bee natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, is it not, if not in al, yet in most men, as nature is the same in all? yea, why is it in so fewe as wee see, that it is not to be found in one of a thousand, and that almost al gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally liue in pleasure and in senselesse secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, without any conscience of sinne or feare of punishment? We answere, that the grounde of this humiliation is, the light of nature, not being neglected &amp; suffered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lie dead, or to decrease daily, as it doth in most men (for then it is not able to send forth this fruit, but is at length cleane extinguished and turned into meere A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme) but augmented by the written law and worde of God, and stirred vp by the iudgements of God. Otherwise this light of nature cannot worke this sorrowe and feare in respect of sinne and the anger


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:26956:24"/>
of God: for how can they haue a troubled conscience, who haue no conscience: or feare of God, whome they doo not know to exist, at least not to do either good or euil? Hence it commeth that this humiliation is so seldome found euen among those who professe the faith, for that they haue no sound knowledge and setled perswasion of God, but a slight and wauering opinion, &amp; therefore no great or vehement humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but onely are sometimes disquieted in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is sufficient that the repentant haue a sight and sense of his sins, and so be, as he cannot but be, affected with sorrow and feare in respect of them, although there be not those horrible pang<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of horror, which are in the repentance of some. The degrees of humiliation arise of these three causes: first, of the diuersitie of sinfulnesse in the repentant: for as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier the burthen is, the more it presseth down so, the mo, and the more hainous that the sinnes of the repentant be, the greater is his humiliation: wherof it commeth that those fearfull agonies of sorrow and despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are not vsually seene, but where ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haynous sinnes haue gone before. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it ariseth of the diuersitie of those outward afflictions and iugdements, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the repentant is punished: the which being of themselues grieuous vnto him, and some tymes such as can not be borne


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:26956:25"/>
by flesh and blood, without great pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and anguish of soule, and so being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the inward burden of his sinnes, and of a troubled spirit (whereof the wise man asketh who is able to beare it) maketh this humiliation verie great. Thirdly, it ary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth of the delay of grace, the which the Lord vouchsafeth to some far sooner then he doth to others, who being kept a long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Lastly, the degrees of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation arise of diuerse apprehensions of the nature of sinne, and of the anger of God, For as the repentant thinketh the one more or lesse haynous, the other more or lesse intollerable: so is his humiliation lesse or greater: yet alwaies (as it hath bin said) it must bee in some measure, otherwise wee haue iust cause to suspect our selues, that we are not yet in the state of grace, and


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:26956:26"/>
regeneration, into the which there is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance but through this narrowe gate, of shame, sorrow, feare, and anguish of soule: and therefore hee that cannot remember himselfe to haue beene in this low estate of humiliation, cannot thinke that he is as yet exalted by the remission of his sinnes, to the fauour of God: but must nowe at length labor to be thus humbled vnder the hand of God: not putting farre out of his mind the euill day, and all things whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer may any way vexe or trouble him, as vsually and naturally men do, but rather laying this corsiue of the wrath of god, and his sinnes committed, to his conscience, &amp; suffering it, there euen to eate and fret a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his heart and soule, till God in mercie take it away. Thus we leauing this poore distressed soule out of conceite with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, esteeming himselfe the most vile and and forlorne caitife in the world, &amp; saying with himselfe: <hi>O miserable man that I am, who shall deliuer me from this body of sin, and of death</hi>? we go on to that which followeth.</p>

                        <p>THus much of the inward humiliation of the soule required in repentance: vnto the which the outward behauior must be correspondent, as we see that the apparell of men is agreeable to their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, degree, and kind of life: and therefore we must now put on this repentant a black mourning weed, that so his outward beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour may be sutable to the inward disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his mind: that as hee is in soule and conscience cast down by the sight of his sin, &amp; the sense of the wrath of god: so he may behaue himselfe accordingly, and expresse his inwarde humiliation in all his wordes, deedes, and in the whole course of his life. But what needeth this, will some man say, considering that God regardeth not the outward, but the inward man, &amp; wil accept a broken and contrite heart without these outward shewes and ceremonies?

Yea that sometimes it may bee omitted: as namely, when by vsing it, we shall incur the suspition of hipocrisie, and a desire of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie, in the which sense this prohibition of it, which Christ maketh, is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, yet it is a thing which God both ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth and requireth, yea, which is manie wayes profitable for him that vseth it. For God will be serued, both by the soule, and by the bodie, and will haue the inward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse of the one expressed and professed by the outward obedience of the other: yea it is a thing pleasing and acceptable in his sight, that there be an agreement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie in al things belonging vnto vs: and therefore hee did in the iudiciall law forbid the Iewes, from sowing diuerse seeds in the same field, or fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> making their garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts half linnen, and halfe wollen: from mourning in a festiuall time. <hi>Nehe.</hi> 8.9. or from ioying and feasting in a time of mourning. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.16. How much more vndecent then wil hee thinke this repugnancie betwixt the soule and the bodie, that when the one


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:26956:27"/>
weepeth, the other should laugh: when the soule is humbled with sorrow and feare, the bodie should he puffed vp, and swell in ioy and pleasure: yea, this outward humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is very needfull and profitable in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the repentant himselfe: for as it is in all other partes of holinesse, the more they are practised by the bodie in life and action, the more they are confirmed and encreased inwardly in the soule: so the more that a man giueth himselfe to the vse of all the outward exercises of humiliation before men, the more doth he humble him selfe in the sight of God. Beside, this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde humiliation will be a great furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to another part of repentance, to wit, amendment of life, and a very effectuall meanes of mortifying the flesh, with all the corrupt lusts thereof.

                        <p>THis outward humiliation must stretch it selfe ouer the whole behauiour and life of this repentant, and must haue place in all his works and deedes, for so we make it of two sorts, verball and reall: verball hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation is commonly called confession, which is a readie and voluntarie acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of sinne, and of deserued wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednesse, to God, and to man.

Lord, I haue sinned and done euill in thy sight, that thou maiest bee iustified in thy sayings, and found pure when thou iudgest: beholde I was borne in sinne, and in iniquitie hath my mother conceaued me.</hi> Yea, this confession must be made simply, plainely, and fully, all excuses, pretences, and shifts being laide aside, without concealing either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sinne, although neuer so great and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, or any circumstance whereby the hainousnesse of it may be aggrauated. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this confession of sinne must bee made to men, whereunto our repentant will much more vnwillingly yeelde, who although he should be much more afraide and ashamed to confesse his sinne in the presence of God, who is puritie it selfe, vncapable of any maner of pollution, yet hee is more ashamed of his sinne in the sight of men, because hee is not so fully perswaded of the presence of GOD, which is not sensible. But howe vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling soeuer he bee, it must be doone, and that euen for that ende cheefely, in regard whereof he is so vnwilling to doo it. For GOD knowing that nothing is more against the mind of a carnall man, then by laying open his greeuous sinnes and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before the eyes of men, to incurre


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:26956:29"/>
shame and ignominie with them, with whom hee hath daily conuersation, and to abiect himselfe, his credit and estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which is dearer to him then his life) at their feet, with whom he hath continual emulation for credit, doth (to bring down his loftie stomacke, and to haue an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble testimony of his grace and vnfained hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation) enioyne this confession of sin to men.</p>
                        <p>Besides, this confession is profitable and often needfull in respect of his good that doth repent: for so by imparting to others the particulars of his state, and of those sins wherunto he is most subiect, he may receiue at the hands of his brethren a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of comfort, edification, and strength to resist the said sinnes, then otherwise hee could do, and be freed from many doubts and errors which do greatly trouble &amp; hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. And yet in making this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to men, diuers things are to bee considered. First it must bee priuate, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the repentance be publike, that is, enioyned by the publike authoritie of the church, for the remouing of some publike offence. Secondly, there is no necessity im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the word of God of confessing sin


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:26956:30"/>
to any one man, more then to another, it being left free vnto the repentant to make choise of him, or the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thinketh fittest for that purpose, of what calling or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession soeuer they bee.

Of this opinion was <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a great Rabbi in Israel, who was amased; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he heard Christ teach this doctrine of regeneration as hauing neuer heard of any such matter before And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when Christ taught that vnlesse a man were born again, he could not possibly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the kingdom of heauen, he maketh this carnall reply: must me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> return into their mothers wombes, and so be borne againe.


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:26956:37"/>
This ignorance of regeneration is the most common hinderance, why men doo not seeke after it: for how can they desire (much lesse seeke) that which they do not know? neither is it any great maruaile that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are ignorant of it, considering first that the selfe-loue which is in man by nature, maketh him to thinke farre better of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, of his owne nature, strength, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, then he should do. And secondly, that the naturall reason of man wil hardly admitte any supernaturall or miraculous worke, resting it selfe in it selfe, that is, in the inherent vertue, and ordinary course of naturall causes. But we are to thinke far otherwise of these things, and renouncing these greeuous and damnable errours, to learne and hold out of the word of God, that it is no lesse impossible to make the corrupt nature and natural faculties of man cleane and pure, his sinfull life and actions good and holy, or his person being guilty of sinne and eternall death, iust and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by any meanes which either man or any creature can vse, then it is to make an Ethiopian white by washing him with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Yea further, that no seruice of God, though neuer so solemne and deuout, no good workes, though neuer so many and


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:26956:37"/>
excellent, no good meaning, though neuer so simple and innocent, no vprightnesse and integritie of life and conuersation, though neuer so great; no worldly prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue whatsoeuer, can make a man accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, much lesse partaker of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glorie, both which belong onely to those, whose natures, mindes, willes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, it pleaseth him according to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal will and counsel to change and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe by the mightie power and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous operation of his spirit. To conclude, we are to looke for saluation by no other meanes, but onely by regeneration, and to seeke for regeneration, not in our selues (for that were to seeke heauen in earth, or rather in hell) or by any vertue, power, or qualitie in our selues, but only at the hands of God, to whom onely the glory both of the first and of the second creation is to be giuen, and to beware least that wee be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with this common errour, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming sinne and holines to be nothing but as morall vertues and vices, spirituall rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration nothing but good education or philosophicall institution, godlinesse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but honest behauiour, christianitie nothing but ciuilitie, the which differ as much, as do the shadow and the substance

                        <p>THe second hinderance, whereby men may be, and are kept backe from see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for regeneration is another false opinion, and conceite of it, whereby men despaire of attayning vnto it, considering either themselues to bee so wholly dead &amp; rotten in sinne, that they cannot imagine how they should euer bee restored to the spirituall life of holinesse, or else this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the supernaturalnesse of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as being a diuine and a miraculous worke.

of supernaturall regeneration.

easie thing) as the Apostle doth <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. where he preferreth the Gospel before the Law, in this respect, for that it teacheth a most readie and easie way of attaining to saluation, namely the beleefe of the heart, and the confession of the mouth, whereas the Lawe requireth perfect obedience, which no man liuing is able to performe. The which dissimilitude is not in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions themselues, (for they are both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like hard, both being altogether impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it being as easie a thing for a carnall man to fulfill the morall lawe, as it is for him to worke in himselfe true faith and confession, the which two are all one in effect) but in this, that God accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and asisteth the ministery of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell with the miraculous operation of his spirit, whereof the ministerie of the Lawe being destitute, is but a dead letter, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to saue the hearer. So then, regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which in respect of the strength of man is altogether impossible, is easie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of GOD, who is no lesse able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the soules of men to their first puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, then hee was in the beginning to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate both bodie and soule: But all the doubt is in the wil of God, whether that, as he is able, so he be willing to worke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation

in euery one that seeketh it. If hee bee willing, then surely either euery one may attaine to regeneration: which is vndoubtedly false, or else very fewe doo seeke after it: the which may be greatly wondered at, that most men should be so carelesse of their owne saluation, as not to thinke it worthy the seeking. If hee be not willing to grant it to all that seek it, then regeneration remaineth as impossible a thing for man to attaine, as if it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to God to worke it in man: and men haue cause to abstaine from that, which neither themselues are able, nor God willing to bring to passe. Wee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, first that it is not so easie and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie a matter as it may bee supposed, for a carnall man to seeke for regeneration and grace, the which is contrarie to his nature. Secondly, if (as it commeth sometimes to passe) he do in some sort desire it, and set himselfe to seeke it, yet he doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuer in this minde and desire as he ought, but faintly in well doing, and so returning to his olde bias, ceaseth from seeking, and looseth his labour. But let vs suppose that, which although it bee very rare, and scarse to bee founde in a whole age, yet it is not impossible, to witte, that a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:26956:40"/>
man doth set him selfe with a resolute purpose of heart to seeke for regeneration, and that in the carefull and painefull vsing of all the meanes of attayning it, he spend and end his dayes: whither is he sure to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his desire, or may happily loose all his labour? we answer, that although God haue appointed, that the carefull seeking of regeneration, should bee the ordinary meanes of obtayning it: yet he hath not so tyed him selfe to the meanes, that it should alwayes, &amp; of necessity bring forth the effect, but hath left it free to him selfe, whither to giue good successe and a happy issue or no. Whereby it may come to passe, that a man may desire and seeke for regeneration, and yet die a carnall man, out of the state of grace and life. Yet wee are both in our selues, and also in others to hope the best. And in that hope both to beginne without despaire, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue without faynting in the carefull see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of grace, leauing the euent to the will and good pleasure of the almightie God. Yea further, we are to take heede, that no wrong opinion arise hereof in our mindes, as it commeth vsually to passe in men carnally minded, who in this case will not sticke to say, that God dealeth

seeking of grace, man when he hath taken the greatest pains in this behalfe, hath done but dutie, nay he hath not in any measure done his dutie: for one regenerate (much lesse a carnall man) cannot seeke for grace, so as he ought, and therfore when he hath done all that he can, he is but an vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table seruant. But besides all this (so endles is the mercie, goodnesse, and equitie of God, yea, so great is his desire to make him selfe manifest to all men in these respects) that it pittieth him to see any thing made frustrate of the expectation in any good endeuours, that rather then he will not do good, hee will do it to those who are euill, and that rather then he will seeme vniust in not rewarding that which men doo falsly thinke to be good, and to deserue good, he will (in some sort, not in truth, for it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him to bestow his blessings on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will, euen on the wicked) be vniust in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding men for that which hee knoweth to be sinfull.</p>
                        <p>Thus this carnall man in seeking grace, doth not either loose his labour, or lacke his reward: for by this meanes, he doth not onely purchase vnto himselfe temporall blessings at the hand of God: but also e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scapeth those fearefull plagues, which are

For the first, although it may seeme a thing not to be named in the Church of God, yet many of those who professe themselues to be Christians, haue in their hearts and mindes no other religion then Atheisme, no God, but their owne bellies, no hope of any other world, then this which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently enioy. They say in their hearts, that there is no God nor diuell, no heauen nor hell, no reward for the godly, nor punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appointed for the wicked, no truth in the scripture, and that it is but folly to serue God: or at the least, they do so doubt of the truth of these things, that they are not by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration of them, either moued to any good, or restrained from any euill: as the apostle writeth to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom the doctrine of the resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from death was called in question, <hi>that some of them were ignorant of god,</hi> that is, were


<pb n="70" facs="tcp:26956:44"/>
meere Atheists. That this is the religion of many christians, it appeareth both by their liues &amp; dealings, which are altogither void of conscience, and the feare of God, and also by the plaine and voluntarie confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the simpler sort, being by sickenesse, feare, hope, loue, or anie other meanes, made to declare their conscience in this behalfe. These men cannot possiblie seeke for regeneration, seeing that they make no account of eternall saluation, wherevnto it leadeth. And therefore this hinderance cannot be taken away, but by proouing that there is a God, who hath promised (and will certainly perfourme it) eternall saluation vnto all those that seeke for it, as they ought to do. But wee are not heere to take in hande the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the principles of religion, the which requireth manie seuerall trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates.

For if we be in good estate, in respect of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, we may the more freely serue God, if distressed we haue the more need to seek to him.

These men doe often incurre the mislike, anger, and hatred of others, insomuch that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their persons, but also their profession becommeth odious vnto them. The causes of this offence are these. First, the diuersity

in iudgement, affection, disposition, in words, deeds, behauiour, and whose cours<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>tance, somtimes in light and indifferent matters, wherein they might much better agree and ioyne with them. Another cause is the contempt ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true or supposed of vnregenerat men, as of those who are in a most wretched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. For often they who professe this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, doe either thinke too hardly, and vncharitably, or else vtter vnseaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably and indiscreetely, what they truely thinke of others. Yea although they doe not offend in these respectes, yet men of lewd behauiour, and dissolute liues will (&amp; not without cause) thinke that those who liue iustly and vprightly, haue a base opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: by the which means, it cannot be but that their affection should bee alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from them. Lastly, euen those who haue receiued grace fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God (much more they who make profession of that grace, which they haue not) haue in them manie wants and infirmities, yea sometimes great vices and sins, by the which they do iustly incur the offence of men.

carnall men conceiue such a mislike of those that professe regeneration, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not abide to hear of it, or of any means tending vnto it. For the remouing of this hindera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce it is the part of al those, who haue receiued this great fauor at the hands of God, to be renued by his spirite, to vse all diligence in not giuing offence either to Iew or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, to Christian or Infidel, to one or other, and so not to make so excellent a thing as regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is (it being the only miraculous worke of God which hath continual place in the Church) to bee euill spoken off.

For first we know that this our purpose of seeking God, may bee preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and made frustrat by death, the which is the full and last period of all the desires, and endeuors of men. God indeed is in the lowest hell, as much as in the highest hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, but in the graue there is no remission of sin, yea no hope, or desire of grace.</p>
                        <p>Besides, let vs suppose that this carnall man that deferreth his repentaunce in this sort (as hee maketh his account, although sometimes he come short of his reckoning) doth by the long suffering of God, prolo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his daies, how knoweth he that he shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies haue the word of God, &amp; the means of regeneration, without the which God

doth not vse to work it. Yea if he haue life and all other things needefull for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, is he so foolish and ignoraunt of his naturall disposition, as to imagine that this desire of grace and resolution of seeking God, wil continue for euer, or for any time if it be not put in practise? This is in no wise to be supposed: for this is an vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted truth, that men generally and naturally as they grow in strength, wit, and worldly wisedome, so they grow in sinfulnesse, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme, infidelity, and hardnesse of heart, being euery day further and further off from seeking God. For as drunkards do by drinking not quench their thirst, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their appetite, but encrease the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thirst of their bodies, and the insatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intemperance of their mindes, so all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worldly pleasures, the longer they are enioyed, the more greedily they are desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and more obstinatly preferred before God, and spirituall graces, as the Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and regeneration, who hauing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time this purpose of turning to God, do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect and loose it, then of theirs who neuer once thought of any such matter. For it is a very vnlike matter, that a man will in his age set his affection on spirituall things, which he reiected and condemned before, when as he was lesse addicted to the world and to sin. We do not deny but that in any age (except infancy) both God may work regeneration in man, and man repentance in himselfe: yet as the bough of a tree being by the groth of many years become stiffe and strong, is now far more easily broken then bowed, so for the most part, men of age, experience, and worldly wisedome do sooner loose their liues then leaue their carnall desires, which they haue so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully nourished, and strengthened all their life time. And therefore wee are to know and consider, that as all other things vnder the sunne, so also this repentance hath an appointed season, which is in no case to be neglected of him, who desireth and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to walke in this way, leading to spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall regeneration and eternall saluation.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow that we haue brought this repentaunt to an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained desire of regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a resolute purpose of seeking it, we are to shew the meanes by the which it is to be sought and may be attayned, the which he is to vse, not as putting any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in them, or thinking him selfe able by them to bring his purpose to passe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all faile, but relying himselfe wholly on the goodnesse, power, and promise of God, who hath promised that he will bee found of those that seeke him, and draw neare to them, that draw near to him. The meanes of seeking regeneration are three. The first is, that reformation which may be in a naturall man. The second is, the hearing of Gods word. The third is, prayer or inuocation. Naturall reformation is a shew, shadow, and resemblance of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the which an vnregenerate man may work in himself by the natural stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of his free will, without any supernaturall


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:26956:51"/>
and extraordinary operation of Gods spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. It is that naturall decrease of sinfulnes, when as a carnall man by vertue of such means as are in his own power to vse, doth not onely represse the outward act of sinne in his life, but also chaungeth in some sort the inward disposition of his mind, and of his will, from ignorance to knowledge, and from vice to vertue, as we know that many both Christians and Heathen, especially those who were called Philosophers, haue done. This reformation is the first meanes of attayning to true regeneration: not that by it (or by any other meanes whatsoeuer) a man can merit grace at the hand of God, or yet make him selfe more capable of grace, for his nature remaineth corrupt, as it was before, because God hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and commaunded, that men should do what they can in renuing themselues, and should approach as near vnto grace as they can, although they cannot by any endeuor or labour, without the worke of Gods spirit attaine vnto it. The whole matter may bee made plaine by this similitude: A certaine King maketh this proclamation, that of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of rebels or malefactors, those, who comming into his presence haue his scepter reached out vnto them, shall liue, the rest


<pb n="86" facs="tcp:26956:52"/>
shall haue the law to passe on them. Yet he keepeth himself within a strong castell, the gates being fast shut. Hereupon many of these malefactors casting off their old and filthy apparel, addresse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in the best manner they can to come before the king. When they come to the place of his abode they finde no entrance (saue onely a few of them) yet they that stand excluded, are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be admitted, then they who contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Kings offer, neuer looke towards him, and yet in truth, they that stand nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to the gates, doe no more deserue life, neither are any more capable of it, or any nearer vnto it, for ought that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues can do, then they who be a hundred miles off. So God biddeth all cast off their sins, their corrupt dispositions &amp; liues, and to come &amp; seeke to him for grace: yet they do not by this means deserue, nor can by any means compell God to admit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into his fauour, &amp; to touch their hearts with his spirit. All should vse this means &amp; hope to obtaine grace: yea none can hope to obtain grace, who do not vse this means, yet some vse the means, and do not obtaine, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers obtaine not vsing the means: yet the meanes is carefully to be vsed, necessary to be known, &amp; therfore now to be declared.</p>

For although the nearest &amp; the surest way were to begin at the soule, in changing the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous disposition of it, as at the fountaine or root, whereunto the streams and the fruite wil easily conforme themselues, yet as men deale with children and young schollers whom they teach that in the first place which is most easie to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued, althogh it be not most needfull or profitable to be knowen, so wee must propound to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant in the first place, reformation of life, as being far more easie then the chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of his inward disposition, least that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he being discoraged by the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the worke, faint and giue all ouer. For the which cause hee must in the first place labour to purge him selfe from those sins whereunto he is giuen, and then inure himselfe to the performance of all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary christian duties: he must lay aside his old filthy rags, before hee put on new and fresh apparell, and first cease from doing euill, before hee can doe good. First therfore he hauing considered what sins he

But our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant must not stay here, for then hee plaieth the hypocriticall Pharisie, making the outside of the cup cleane, but leauing it foule and filthie within: and therefore we must desire him to trie what he can do in mending the corrupt and sinfull life of his soule, and of all the faculties thereof. This is, no doubt, a hard peece of worke, passing the cunning of any creature, and


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:26956:54"/>
belonging to God onely, yet man may in some sort chaunge his soule, although not from sinfulnesse to holinesse, yet from vice to vertue, and from ignorance to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Wherein our repentant is to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, vsing all good meanes of getting knowledge and vertue. He is to giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe carefully to the reading and studying of the Scripture, and of all other bookes conteyning sounde and true doctrine, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of the worde of GOD. Yea, although hee meete with manie poynts of doctrine, which hee cannot possiblie vnderstande, conceaue, or beleeue, yet hee is not to giue ouer, but rather to ascribe the hardnesse of them to his owne dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the impossibilitie of others of them, to his owne incredulitie, not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the power of God. Likewise he is to labour in chaunging the inward disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his will and affections, framing and bending the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from euill to good, by reasons and perswasions take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both out of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and also out of prophane writers, in whom we may find notable pattern, of al vertues, by the examples of Christians, and also of Infidels, of whom many haue so profited in these exercises, that they may seeme to haue attained to the perfection


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:26956:55"/>
of vertue. Yea, he is to vse great seueritie towarde himselfe, in repressing the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersenesse and rebellion of these head-strong faculties, and that by denying vnto them the lawfvll vse of things, that so they may be farre from vnlawfull desires. To be short, hee who doth desire and seeke for regeneration must by all meanes endeuour not onely to purge himselfe from all open and grosse sinnes, by leading a life vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable before men, but also from smal and secrete sinnes, by keeping a good conscience in all his wayes, in the sight of God: yea, not onely to abstaine from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, but also to perfourme all Christian and honest duties, both to God and man. Yea, he must purge not onely his life and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from sinne, but also his minde from ignoraunce, vsing all good meanes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in Religion: yea, his will and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from all vices, lustes, and corrupt desires, and so, as much as lyeth in his power, to renue himselfe. And yet when he hath done all that he can, hee is but where he was, to wit, a carnall man, as dead in sinne, as any man is in his graue. Yet he hath vsed the first meanes of obtayning grace, and eternall glorie, and hath done that whereby that grieuous condemnation

                        <p>To the second question wee answere, that God for the ende mentioned, to wit, the concealing of his myraculous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, vseth to vse a meanes, hauing in it a vertue, although not able to bring foorth the effect, yet helping towardes it, and of some force for that purpose, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the iudgement of a naturall man. And so in regeneration, it is plaine, that the ministerie of the word seemeth to haue (for most men thinke that it hath indeede) the power of renuing men inherent in it selfe. For thus they reason: men being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with reason, may by teaching bee brought to knowledg, by force of argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t


<pb n="95" facs="tcp:26956:56"/>
they may bee perswaded to vertue and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, whereof a vertuous and honest life will easely followe: yea, there is no doubt, but that God doth ordinarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare men after a sort for grace, drawing them nearer to himselfe then other carnall men are: and therefore the ministerie of the worde is a fit meanes of regeneration.</p>
                        <p>The third poynt may verie well be made a question among those who thinke that the ministerie of the worde, hath the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie of regenerating inherent in it selfe: for why shoulde not a man learne and bee perswaded, as well by himselfe, as with others, as well at home as in the Church? Otherwise it is no question, neither is there any other answere to bee made vnto it, but onely this, that so it pleaseth God to worke by publicke, and not by priuate means. And yet no man can denie, but that it is more meete, that regeneration beeing so wonderfull and glorious a work of God, should bee wrought rather in the publike bodie of the Church, in the assemblye of those who are alreadie sanctified, then in hugger mugger, in this or that corner. So that the second meanes of attaining to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, is the word of God, publikly &amp; purely preached: not as it doth by a natural


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:26956:57"/>
facultie inherent in it selfe, worke in men knowledge, obedience, and that reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and amendement of life mentioned in the former Chapter, to the which it is to be referred in this respect, but as it doth by the supernaturall power of GOD worke true regeneration in the elect. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it standeth euery one in hande, who hath any care and desire to attaine to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, to be diligent in hearing the word of God, whensoeuer occasion serueth. As the wise man exhorteth the good husband to be sowing his seede at all houres, times, and seasons, because he knoweth not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this or that will prosper: so must this repentant take al occasions of hearing gods worde, for that hee knoweth not but that God will euen at that time which hee would bestow on worldly profites or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, bestow this vnspeakeable blessing of regeneration vpon him.

                        <p>THe third and last meanes to be vsed in seeking regeneration, is praier or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation of the name of God, wherby this repentant seeing himselfe to bee as yet but carnal &amp; hard hearted, as he was before, and that no meanes, either deuised by himselfe; or appointed by God will preuaile, renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth himselfe, as beeing most desperately miserable, &amp; all meanes in the world, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnable to effect that which he desireth, and so flieth to the onely mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, desiring him for his mercies sake, and for Christs sake, in whom all the mercie and goodnesse of God, as the great Ocean ouerflowing the earth, doth shewe forth it selfe, to vouchsafe vnto him, the most wretched and vnworthy creature in the world, one drop of his grace, to mollifie his stonie heart, and to quicken his soule, being now cleane dead in sinne. This must


<pb n="98" facs="tcp:26956:58"/>
be done, not seldome, coldly, negligently, and for fashions sake, as men vse to pray, for so men aske those things which are of no account, and which they care not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether they obtaine or no, but in all vehemencie of spirite and affection, yea, with all importunitie, wee giuing no rest, night nor day, eyther to our selues, or to God, till wee obtaine our desires. This prayer will bee of great force, as wee are taught by the Parable of the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate widdowe. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.5. and therefore wee are not to bee wearie, or faint in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourming this dutie to GOD, and to our owne soules, but rather to prepare our selues by all meanes (as by abstayning from the superfluous and vnnecessarie vse of meates, drinke, sleepe, worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, and whatsoeuer may hinder vs in this behalfe, and by considering the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable excellencie of the thing wee labour to attaine for the right perfour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it. The which if wee do, wee shall see and finde, that prayer is the most wonderfull thing in the worlde, able to worke myracles, yea, stronger then the strongest that is, then God himself, who (as the scripture teacheth, or rather speaketh) is by prayer forced and compelled to do that


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:26956:58"/>
which otherwise he would not do. No man can by force wring any thing out of the hands of God, whose weakenesse is strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then men: yet, prayer in that it renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all force of meanes, relying it self who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the goodnesse of God, is of greatest force, and that by the which if wee wrestle with God, wee neede not doubt of ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming of him. If men of great and loftie spirites (who to God are as fillie wormes, creeping on the earth) stand so much vpon their reputation, that (as it is recorded of the Senatours of Rome in olde time) they thinke it a great disgrace vnto them, that any man should say that hee had in vaine asked helpe at their handes, shall not God the great King of Heauen and earth, who is as able as the richest, and as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to giue as the frankest, yea, and hath as great care, (and not without cause) of his glorie, as anie man hath of his worldlie worship and renowme, thinke scorne that anie man should say, there is no help for me in GOD, I haue in vaine afflicted my soule, humbled my selfe at his footstoole, cleansed my wayes in his sight, repayred to the place of his presence, and called vpon him: there is nothing to bee hoped for or gotten at his hands.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="100" facs="tcp:26956:59"/>Yea further, as this exercise of praier is the most readie and effectuall meanes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this, or any other blessing at the hands of God:, so often it pleaseth God to grant grace to men, euen whilest they are asking it, to touch mens hearts by his spirit in the verie instant wherein the heart and the soule of man is in vehement and earnest prayer in a maner separated from the body and lifted vp into heauen. For euen as the smith striketh the iron while it is hote, and and fit to receaue any forme or impression: so God, although hee could imprint his grace in the coldest, hardest and flintiest disposition of the heart, yet he rather doth it, when as the affections of men are stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp, and enflamed either by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the word, and publike prayer (du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the which regeneration is ordinarily wrought in men) or else by some priuate Christian exercise, as reading the scripture and serious meditation, but especially by praying and singing Psalmes to god, in the time of the which actions, it pleaseth God somtimes to send his spirit into the harts of his elect. But it may be here obiected, that we suppose an impossible thing, to wit, that an vnregenerate man should pray, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with that vehemencie, and perseuerance,


<pb n="101" facs="tcp:26956:59"/>
which wee require, as appeareth by those words of the Apostle. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How shall they call on him, on whom they haue not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued</hi>? Wee answer, that this is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of Infidels, who knowe not the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: not of Christians, who may bee indued with knowledge, yea, who may pray, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not as they ought, and as the faithfull do.</p>
                        <p>Thus we haue commended to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant the meanes of attaining to regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, wherof the first is that reformation and amendement of life, which may bee in one as not yet regenerate. The second is, the diligent hearing of Gods worde. The third, earnest and continuall praier. By the first, he addresseth himself to come to God, casting off his filthy sinnes, and putting on the new garment of a religious, iust, vpright and honest life: by the second, he standeth waiting at the gate of Gods mercy, where vsually men are receyued into fauour: by the third, hee becommeth a little more bolde, presumeth to knocke and rappe at Gods gate, where we leaue him prepared, wayting and knocking till it please God to open and let him in.</p>

For although regeneration beeing so great, and a totall chaunge bee vsually so euident, especially to him in whom it hath place, that hee can not doubt of it, yet it commeth often to passe by the temptation of Sathan, and that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall infidelitie which remayneth in them, that euen the faythfull are brought to this passe, that they knowe not what to make of themselues: but eyther thinke or at the least suspect themselues to bee in the middest of a troublesome and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous Sea, when as in trueth they are arryued in the Hauen.</p>

For wee are not to looke for it in our banquets, pastimes, sleepe, recreations, or while wee are busied about worldly affaires, but while wee heare the worde of GOD, while wee pray vnto him publikely, or (perhaps) pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately alone, or with others, while wee humble our selues in fasting, and vnfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned sorrowe for our sinnes. In the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmance of the which Christian duties, GOD is by his mightie power able to turne the hearts of men which way hee lifteth, to change the naturall disposition of his soule, whom hee then calleth, making it looke towarde himselfe, which before did frowardlie abhorre from all good, and vppe to heauen, which before had the eies fixed in earthly things. Whereupon this repentaunt (for wee will yet giue him his olde name, because hee doubteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to bee still, not a newe, but the olde man) feeleth all the facultyes of his soule, his minde, will, and affections straungely chaunged.

Whereas before he doubted of Gods fauor, and the pardon of his sinne, now he is vndoubtedly perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of both: and so he is now replenished with vnspeakable ioy, &amp; heareth the spirit (not of bondage, and feare, wherewith hee was possessed) but of adoption crying in his heart, Abba father. He now feeleth himself able to withstand those sinnes wherevnto before he yelded continually at the first: to haue a delight in praying to God, and in all Christian exercises wherevnto before hee was drawn by feare of the displeasure either of men, or perhaps in some conscience of sinne in feare of the wrath of God, and a desire to auoyd it. And to conclude, hee feeleth all those parts of holinesse wrought in some measure in his soule, which are requited in the faithfull.</p>

actually regenerated by the spirite of God: but it likewise must continually be tended, fed, and cherished, yea healed of all those ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies which by any meanes happen vnto it. This we call the right dieting of the soule, resembling the soule to the bodie, that both the doctrine may be plaine and easie, being illustrated &amp; declared by sensible &amp; fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar similitudes, and also, that the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all care and paines which we take about our bodies, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This spirituall diet hath two partes, conseruatiue, and restoratiue, the former continueth and keepeth in the soule that measure of grace and of holinesse, which it hath receiued from God, the other restoreth it when it is lost, and repaireth it being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caied. Againe, conseruatiue diet hath two parts, nutritiue and preseruatiue: consisting, the one in the right vse of those things, by


<pb facs="tcp:26956:62"/>
the which the soule is nourished, the other in the carefull auoyding of all things, which are hurtfull vnto it: spirituall nourishment consisteth in two t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ings, foode and exercise, whereof the one is the matter, the other the meanes, maner or forme of nutrition.</p>
                  <p>Further, we are to consider how the soule hath resemblance to the state of the bodie, and how it being of it selfe simple and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, can be subiect to alterations, distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and diseases, which haue place in the bodie, by reason of the contrarietie of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties preuailing, or yeelding one to another: to wit, that as in the bodie heate and moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, so in the soule, holinesse &amp; sinfulnesse do continually fight togither, the one labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to consume and expell the other, the sinfulnesse of the flesh labouring to quench all the good motions of the spirit, and the spirit striuing to crucifie the flesh, with all the corrupt lusts thereof: Gal. <hi>5.17. The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirite against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other.</hi> This is the composition &amp; temperature of the soule,


<pb facs="tcp:26956:63"/>
hauing place onely in the state of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein the soule hath in it selfe both holinesse and sinfulnesse: but not in the state of innocencie, or yet since the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> in carnall men: when as t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e soule being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither either holy or sinful, cannot be said to haue this composition or temperature.</p>
                  <p>These points of doctrine may profitably be considered. But first we are to know, that the paines and care taken in dieting and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the soule, ought to bee continuall without any intermission, for that as the body being neglected for a small time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth weake and distempered, yea soone falleth into sicknesse and doth perish, so is it with the soule, the which being neglected but a litle, there will a decrease of holinesse be plainly felt, yea perhaps seene by others. The reason whereof is manifest: to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause both outward occasions and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and also t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e inward corruption of sin, neuer ceaseth from oppugning this holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and therefore as the bodie must continually be repaired with nouris<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ment, because it is continually consumed by our


<pb facs="tcp:26956:63"/>
naturall heate, so must the soule by a good diet daily vsed, bee preserued. Thus the scripture doth euery where exhort vs to a continuall vse of all spirituall exercises, as namely of praier, Eph. <hi>6.18. Pray alwaies with all maner of praier and supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the spirit.</hi> And <hi>1.</hi> Thess. <hi>5.16. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce euermore, pray continually:</hi> not as if (as some haue fondly imagined) wee ought to giue our selues so wholly to spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall exercises, as that we neglect our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies &amp; this present life, as most men bestow all their time, care and labour, about their bodies, without any regarde had to their soules. For as God hath giuen vnto vs both bodies and soules, so it is his will that both be carefully preserued, and that both for the maintenance of this present life, we labour daily &amp; diligently in some lawfull calling, &amp; for the preseruing of the life of our souls we vse that spiritual diet which we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to declare. Yet as heauenly, spirituall, and eternall things are farre more excellent and more to be desired then earthly things, so we ought to haue greater care of the one


<pb facs="tcp:26956:64"/>
then of the other, and so to frame the course of our life, that we entangle our selues in no mo worldly duties then are needfull. Thus the Apostle counselleth, <hi>1.</hi> Cor. <hi>7.</hi> that the seruant should not neglect any duty which his maister enioyneth him, vnder pretence of seruing God but yet desire a free life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in it he may haue greater opportunitie and leisure to serue God: and like wise, that we should preferre a single life before mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which (vsually) bringeth with it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cares &amp; troubles. According to this rule they who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath blessed with riches and abundance of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orldly things, ought to giue more time, care and labour to the seruice of God, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they who are in pouertie, and want things needful: and to say with themselues, soule thou hast goods laide vp for many yeares, and therefore (not take thy ease and make thy selfe drunke with the superfluitie of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orldly pleasures) but, take time as much as thou wilt to serue God, and to clense thy selfe from the filthinesse of sin, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the abhominable to God. But vsual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, as it were adding thirst to drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,


<pb facs="tcp:26956:64"/>
the more they haue, the more they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to haue, and are more careful in seeking worldly things, then they who are in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test want.</p>
                  <p>Besides, it is needful for the right dieting of the soule, that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

For whereas Christ sayeth, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.17. <hi>The whole haue no need of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian,

as most men liuing are truely said to haue their health, howsoeuer that exact tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature, <hi>ad pondus,</hi> wherof Phisitians dispute, cannot be found in any man, or in any age: so, absolute perfection of holinesse is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to spiritual health.

And if by the grace of God supporting him in this temptation, he be not brought to this desperate passe, yet the committing of any one sin taketh from him, or doth greatly diminish diuerse parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular graces, especially affiance, hope, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ioy, and the peace of conscience: and in stead of these, bringeth a fearefull expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wrath of God, and of those iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts which he vsually poureth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinners.

lawfully vsed, for that the creatures of God serue and are created not onely for necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for then infinite things are in vaine, for a few are needful, but also for the pleasure &amp; solace &amp; delight of the faithful. Yet the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ordinary vse of them is hurtfull and not to be granted or taken. First, in that it taketh away our time &amp; care, which should be giuen to the seruice of God, to the study and practise of godlinesse, and all Christian duties fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> these things, and bestoweth them on vaine and momentanie pleasures. For although wee may after a sort do both, to wit, sometimes with <hi>Mary</hi> sit at Christs feete hearing his word, &amp; anon with <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> giue our selues to worldly matters: yet wee shall finde, that this superfluous vse of worldly pleasures, will bee a great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to those other duties, and make vs altogether vnfit for the performance of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We do not denie, but that a Christian may haue in some measure, that care for his soul which is meete, and withall not onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme all the necessarie duties belonging to his calling and the good estate of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, yea, and sometimes walke foorth and make a vagarie into the gardens of pleasure, thereby both to satisfie the infirmitie of his flesh and fraile nature, and also to make


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:26956:72"/>
himselfe more ioyfull and chearefull in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, thanking, and praysing God: but if hee haue his dayly conuersation, and make his continuall abode in them, he may indeede serue God there in some sort, but he shall finde it dangerous in respect of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life and health: yea, as vnholsome for the soule as it is pleasant for the body. The minde and affections of a man may indeede be set on diuers things, on earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heauenly pleasures: but that which is giuen to the one, is taken from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and the more we are affected to the one, the lesse delight we shall haue in the other: for that there is a kind of contrariety betweene the flesh and the spirit, betweene fleshly and spirituall pleasures, studies, and exercises, arising not of their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: according to which the se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleasure is euen as bellowes to strire vp in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, loue, obedience &amp; thankfulnes to God: as we know that God placed <hi>Adam</hi> in his creation in Paradise, a place of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, but by reason of the corruption of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s nature, which cannot vse them moderately and in due tymes, it cannot tast of them, but it will drinke of them, it cannot drinke of them, but it will bee drunke with them: yea, it will adde thirst vnto drunkennesse,

euen an vnsatiable appetite, to the greatest, surfet, yea, when it hauing ouercharged it self is constrained to vnlode it selfe, and abstaine for a season, it will afterwards more greedily then euer it did returne to the vomit, and so wallow continually in all sensual pleasure. By this means haue many of the serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God beene ouertaken: yea, it is the vsual means, by the which satan worketh in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a decrease of holines, making them to drinke so deepe of this cup of worldly pleasures, that straitgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way they fall into sleepe or slumber, and so forgetting themselues, neglect their soules. Besides, this licentiousnes is the next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and cousin germain to sin it self, which for the most part consisteth in the vse of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden and vnlawfull pleasures: and therfore to be auoided as very dangerous, as it is the part of a wise man not to walke too near the brink of a deep riuer, where into if he chance to slip, there is da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of drowning, but rather to keepe a loofe off, and so to be in safetie. So that in these respects a good dietarie of the soule must carefully auoyde this licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnes &amp; too free vse of worldly pleasures, as wee are in many places of the Scripture counselled &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. <hi>Luc.</hi> 21.24. <hi>Take heede least at any time your hearts be oppressed with surfetting &amp; drunkennesse, &amp; the cares of this

As for sleepe and natural rest, the which is needfull for the norishing &amp; preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the body, it hath no place in this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall diet: for the flesh is fraile, and would soone be consumed with labor, if it had not som rest &amp; intermission in the time of sleep: but the soule cannot bee wearied by doing good, but contrarily getteth strength by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But why is food more needfull for the soule, then rest or sleepe? and why can it not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue as well without the one as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other? It needeth no rest, because it cannot be wearied, but it must be norished, both because it is imperfite in regard of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, and therfore must be increased, till it come to the full stature and perfection: and also because it is dayly diminished by the corruption of sin, and therfore must be dayly repaired by conuenient food. Euen as we do daily feede our bodies, for these two endes, first, to augment them as long as they are in growth, then after that they haue come to their pitch and naturall bignesse, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store so much of the substance of them, as is dayly wasted away by the force of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heate.

Surely, no bodily meate, though neuer so fine and daintie: for if we eate we do not therefore abounde in grace: and if we eate not, we are not dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: neither any earthly thing: for the food of the soule is that whereof holinesse is made, the which hath the originall, not from earth, but from heauen, whither wee muste lifte vppe our eyes, and thence looke for this spirituall and heauenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na: not from any creature that is in heauen,

For we are not here to declare howe this publicke preparation should bee made, for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth not to this Treatise: yet as all men knowe, that the good estate of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die dooth chieflie consist herein, that the meate wherewith it is nourished be well dressed, and made fitte for the receyuer, not rawe, offensiue, or mingled with any hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing: so, without question, the health of the soule dooth chiefly depende on the ministrie of the worde, that it offer to the Church nothing but that which is both in it selfe good and sounde, and also made

fitte for the present estate of the hearers. And surely it is to bee wished (and the contrarie greatlie to bee wondered at) that men were as carefull in prouiding for themselues, wyse and cunning Cookes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prepare a right the sacred worde of the euerlyuing GOD, wherewith their soules are, or ought to bee fedde to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, as they are curious about the dressing of theyr bodily meate, which is soone turned into fylth, and so cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as a most loathsome thing: yea, which together with the bellye, for the which it is prepared, shall be abolished: as in the first to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> the sixt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and thirteenth verse.

This point of spiritual Diet is necessarily to be regarded, for that many faile in it, who do in some measure heare aright, as many haue an insatiable appetite in deuouring meate, who cannot keepe it for any space of time.

For Christians must not bee as babes, vnable to feede themselues or to take any nourishment vnlesse it be put into their mouths by others, but must, as they receiue the meate prepared by others, so also dresse some for themselues, and that by gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word of God, the onely foode of


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:26956:82"/>
the soule where it is to be had, euen there where the publike food is had, to wit, in the Scripture, in the creatures, and in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God. In these fieldes the word of God groweth, and therefore a Christian is to bee continually conuersant in them, and so to make his soule strong, fat, and lustie. First therefore he is to giue himselfe to the reading, studying, vnderstanding, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of the scripture. For the profitable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the word of God, diuers things are to be considered: first that we reade it with this intent and purpose, to edifie our selues in the knowledge and obedience of Christ, making our spirituall edification the end of our reading. Otherwise wee may spend all our dayes, yea, although they were as many as the daies of <hi>Methuselah,</hi> and yet receiue no more encrease of holinesse, then they who neuer heard tell of the word of God. For why? it is impossible that any man should find this spirituall foode, but he who doth hunger after it, and seeketh it with all care and diligence. Indeede God some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is found of those who doo not seeke, nor yet so much as aske after him, and doth by his spirit renewe those, who do not once thinke of regeneration or saluation: but here we do not speake of the extraordinary and


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:26956:83"/>
immediate working of God in regenerating men, but of that ordinarie continuance and encrease of holinesse which euery faithfull man may and ought to worke in himselfe by such meanes as God hath appointed. This he that seeketh findeth, hee that seeketh it not, shal neuer find it. Hence it is that many haue beene very painefull readers of the scripture, who neuer found in them any spiritual fruit or comfort, because they read them not to that end, but for some sinister respect. The <hi>Iewes</hi> tooke great pains in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or rather in learning without booke the books of the old testament: yea, so great as may make Christians (who cannot finde in their hearts to bestow so much time and pains in seeking or keeping Christ, pardon of sin, &amp; eternal glory, as they do in seeking an earthly king &amp; earthly glory, the which onely they looke for by their Messiah) and yet they finde not Christ nor any spirituall grace, because they seeke not for such things. So, many other haue read the scriptures for other sinister ends, some to get the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of curious and vnprofitable questions and controuersies of endlesse genealogies, yea, some for confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their erronious &amp; heretical opinions, some for meere know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge &amp; vaine ostentation. But he who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth


<pb n="35" facs="tcp:26956:83"/>
to be a good phisitian of his own soule, must, laying aside these and all such respects, propound to himselfe the confirmation and encrease of his faith, loue, patience, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance &amp; of all other spirituall graces. These things must be continually in his mind, yea, he must apply to these purposes, all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, examples and doctrines, wherewith he meeteth, minding onely poynts of spirituall edification, and especially those whereof he most doubteth, and would bee resolued, and which belong most to his present vse. This rule and counsell we haue giuen by <hi>Eliphas. Iob.</hi> 5.27. who after that he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared at large both the iustice of God in punishing the wicked, and his goodnesse in sparing, sauing and blessing the godly, hee addeth this notable conclusion. <hi>Loe, thus we haue inquired of it, and so it is: heare it and know it for thy selfe,</hi> that is, do not content thy selfe with the generall knowledge of this doctrine, but applie it to thy owne speciall state. Not as if it were vnlawfull for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, in reading the Scripture, to obserue and studie those things which doo not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectlye tende to spirituall edification, for it is good and commendable, if hee can giue so much time to the study of the word, as that hee knowe all the circumstaunces of

In the which respect, he is also to make choyse of those bookes of Scripture, for his dayly reading, studying and meditating, in the which this spirituall food dooth most plentifully growe, and may most easily bee had. For although whatsoeuer is written, bee written for our comfort and edification, and that no part of the Scripture ought to bee accounted bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and vnprofitable, yet some partes are more excellent, and more effectuall for spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall edification then others are, in that they handle those points wherein the good estate of the soule consisteth, more fully and plainly then others do. Thus the writings of the Prophets are to be preferred, before the bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> to the which they are as Commentaries: and the writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles before the writings of the Prophets, for that all the mysteries of our saluation are now in the time of the Gospel plainely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, which before were couered with types and ceremonies. Yea, of the bookes of


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:26956:84"/>
the new Testament, the Epistles written by the Apostle Paule, and others, do more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly ayme at this marke, then the storie of the liues and acts of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. But of all the bookes of Scripture, it seemeth that the booke of the Psalmes doth most excell in this behalfe, the which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth wholy of spirituall meditations, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations, precepts and experiments, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that it may truly bee called the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian mans Garden, wherein all manner of wholsome hearbes, and soueraigne medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines may be had. And therefore a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, although he ought not to bee a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in anie part of the booke of God, yet he ought to be most conuersant in this, and such other, as that hee scarce euer lay them out of his hands. Yea, in these bookes some sayings and sentences are more excellent then others, and therfore more specially to be regarded and remembred.</p>

                        <p>We answere, that as it is not possible, so it is not needfull for any man to attain the true sense of the scripture in euerie place: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that it is both possible and easie for any Christian to vnderstand so much of it as will serue for his spirituall edification in all respects. Yea, it hath pleased God in great mercy and wisedome so to prouide for the saluation of his elect, as to make those things which are most effectuall to edification, most easie to be vnderstood, and so to meete with the carnall curiositie of men, as to make vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary questions and quiddities most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, and euen as labyrinthes, into the which it is easie to enter, but impossible to get foorth. And therefore no man ought to be kept backe from reading the scripture, by


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:26956:85"/>
considering the difficultie of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather to be persuaded, that by prayer to God who can open the eies of the blind to behold the wonderful things of his law, by acquainting himselfe with the phrase &amp; maner of speech which the holy Ghost vseth, by conferring one place with another: and lastly, by vsing the helpe of those who haue laboured pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and faithfully in searching out the true meaning of the scripture, hee shall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand so much of it, as shall be aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly sufficient for his edification and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Thus the scripture being paineful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read and truely vnderstood, will yeelde vnto vs plentifull foode for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our knowledge, faith, loue, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, temperance, and of all spirituall graces. Wee shall enter into these fertile fieldes and pleasant gardens, in ignorance, doubting, distrust, impatience, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but shall come out of them full of faith and of the holy Ghost, and repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with all spirituall ioy. With this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the scripture, we must ioyne the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the writings of those who haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the doctrines &amp; exhortations co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therin to their proper heads, in forme of catechismes, sermons, commentaries, treati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, disputations, common places, and praier,


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:26956:86"/>
and so haue prepared spirituall foode for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who haue not the like oportunitie of doing it. The benefite and profite, which the Chuch reapeth by this meanes, is verie great. For by this meanes many poyntes of singular vse are gotten, and as it were digged out of the scripture, which otherwise would lie in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as in the bowels of the earth, hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and vnknowne, especially they who are not endued with so great a measure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and iudgement, as that they are able of themselues to vnderstand the scripture, &amp; therout to gather whatsoeuer is needfull for them. And therfore they are to be red both thankfully, in respect of god, the giuer and authour of them: and also carefully, in regard of our own profit &amp; edification, yet not with that reuerence, estimation, and confidence, which is to be vsed in reading the scripture. For that which man saith may bee false, but whatsoeuer God speaketh, is vndoubtedly true. For the which cause, we are not to relie and depend wholy vpon the writings &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of any man, of what learning &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count soeuer he be, as it is <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

His prouidence, by the which all things, all the actions and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of all creatures are disposed, ordered, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, restrained, vpheld, as that they all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerally and ioyntly tend to those endes for the which he appointed them, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of those things which he will haue brought to passe, as namely, first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, and generally, the setting forth of his glorie, which is the last end both of the creation, and also of the administration of all things: and secondly the execution of his iustice vppon the reprobate for their sins, and of his loue and mercy in the saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the elect. His iustice appeareth in that he recompenseth euery one according vnto his doings, and that without fauour or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of person, laying feareful iudgements euen vpon his elect for their sinnes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding the good deedes of the reprobate with temporall blessings: but most of all he doth dayly poure forth the treasures of his goodnesse, loue, &amp; mercy, toward his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seruants, in preseruing them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all euill, and in prouiding for them whatsoeuer is needfull.

and stories of the Church: but they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially to be obserued in the age and time wherein we ourselues liue, for that we giue greater credence, &amp; are more affected with those things which wee behold with our owne eies, which we haue noted our selues, knowing the persons in whom they befell, and all the circumstances of the said actions, then with those which we haue at the second hand by the report of others, and which in all respects are strange and vnknowne vnto vs. Thus the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> mentioneth <hi>Psal.</hi> 37.25. one of his owne obseruations the which he had bene al his life time, euen a whole age in gathering, of the gracious prouidence of God ouer his seruants, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>I haue beene yong and now I am olde, yet did I neuer see the righteous forsaken or his seed beg their bread.</hi> Of these obseruations co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the blessings of God bestowed on the righteous, and his fearefull plagues poured on the wicked, the bookes of <hi>Iob</hi> and of the Psalmes are full: yea, it is in many places made a signe of godlinesse to marke the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of God, as the neglect of it is of an vngodly man, as <hi>Eccl.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The wise man hath his eies in his head, but the foole walketh in darknesse.</hi> And <hi>Es.</hi> 57.1. <hi>The iust man is taken away fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the plague that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, and no man

And more especially, we are carefully to obserue those actions of God which concerne our selues, as namely how he hath from time to tyme prouided for vs al things needful, euen in our greatest wants, when as all men did forsake vs: how hee hath preserued vs from great dangers, how he hath chastised vs for our sins, how he hath heard our prayers and granted our requests, how he hath comforted vs in our afflictions, how hee hath rewarded all our good works &amp; godly endeuors, how he hath assisted vs by his spirit in time of tentation, how hee hath sometimes let vs remaine in sinne, irrepentance, and hardnes of heart, &amp; at other times hath giuen vs soft hearts, mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at his promises and threatnings, as waxe before the fire, &amp; sending forth riuers of the teares of true repentance, how hee hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued for our sins, or blessed for our sakes, our friendes, acquaintance, wiues, children, kinsfolke and seruants, how he hath reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led himselfe, his will and truth vnto vs, and

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:26956:90"/>
reading, meditating, and regarding the word: yet they are not nourished by this foode, because they do not ioyne exercise vnto it.</p>
                        <p>This spirituall exercise is the practise of christianity, or of spiritual graces, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Christian duties, belonging either to God or man: and therefore it must of necessitie be of diuers kindes, as there are many kinds of spirituall graces, and of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian duties. The first and chiefe kind of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual exercise, is prayer or inuocation of the name of God, both publike &amp; also priuate, by the right vse wherof, wee shall feele all the graces of Gods spirit to be stirred vp in vs, yea, confirmed and encreased: yea, all drousines and heauiness of soule to be sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, as will easily appeare by conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the seuerall parts of it. For, the more that wee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse our sins, and the multitude and hainousness of them, as it were pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them out in their naturall shape, and in liuely colours, the more wee loath and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor: them: the oftner and more seriously that we consider the iudgements of God either present, or which are like inough to bee shortly poured vpon vs for our sinnes, and also the benefits temporall and spiritual, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued at the hands of God, the more wee


<pb n="49" facs="tcp:26956:90"/>
increase in feare and loue, and all dutifull thankfulnesse towards him, and therfore whosoeuer desireth to preserue his soule in health and strength, must haue speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to this, that he giue himselfe to the daily &amp; continuall vse of prayer, the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity and efficacie whereof is so great, that it may truely be called the soule of the soule, that is, that whereon the life and good estate of the soule doth depend, it being impossible that either that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an who is diligent in prayer, should bee weake in grace, or that grace should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounde where there is neglect of prayer. But what shall wee account diligence in prayer, or how often ought a Christian to performe this dutie? The answere wee haue in many places of the scripture, as namely, <hi>Thessalonians</hi> 5.17. <hi>Pray without ceasing.</hi> And <hi>Ephesians</hi> 6.18. <hi>Pray in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with all perseuerance, in all manner of praier and supplications at all times.</hi> And <hi>Luke.</hi> 18.1. He tolde them a parable to this ende, <hi>that they should pray alwaies, and neuer bee wearied.</hi> This generall commandement is thus to bee vnderstood and restrained, pray at all seasons vppon all occasions: thinke not this exercise to be needelesse vnprofitable, or vnseasonable at any time,


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:26956:91"/>
in the night, or in the day, in the morning, or at noone: in the towne, or in the field: in businesse, or in leysure. Thus haue the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God liued, and thus they haue pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on their daies in continuall inuocation of the name of God. Thus did <hi>Paule.</hi> 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Night and day without measure I pray, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Dauid. Psal.</hi> 55.18. <hi>In the euening, in the morning, and at noone day, I will meditate, I will make a noyse in praier, and the Lord shall heare my voyce.</hi> And we reade of <hi>Daniel. Dan.</hi> 6.10. That it was his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome to pray vnto God thrise euery day. Out of the which precepts and examples, wee may easely gather, howe much tyme and care ought to bee allotted, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vppon this exercise, and that it is continually to be performed. For it is not with our soules in this respect, as it is with our bodyes, the which may easelie surfeit, of meate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or of exercise, for that they beeing of meane strength, can not beare much of either, but are soone ouerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and hurt: whereas the soule hath not any pitch or set limit eyther of holinesse, but is to growe on further, euen when as it is at the highest, or of the meanes by the which it is attayned: and therefore we cannot exceed in this behalfe: vnlesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:26956:91"/>
wee (as verie fewe doo) fall into the practise of that heresie which giueth all the time of a mans life to prayer, and none to the preseruation of lyfe, in following the workes of our callings, the which is in no case to bee admitted. And therefore that it may bee knowen what is required at the handes of a Christian in this behalfe, and what is needfull for the right dieting of the soule, wee will consider this poynt more at large, and in particular, in this manner. As bodilye, so also spirituall exercise is eyther ordinarie, or extraordinarie, the one is to bee vsed dayly, the other at some tymes onelie, as occasions require. For as sometimes the bodie requireth long and vehement exercise, the which is not to bee admitted in ordinary diet, for that it would soone dry vp and consume the body, so it is sometimes needfull, that a christian vse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie praier, and that for the better performance of this exercise, hee lay aside for a time all other duties, cares and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumberances whatsoeuer, the which hee may not doo ordinarily, as the Apostle teacheth. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. That when as it is so needefull in anie respect, as for the auoyding or remoouing of anie great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffliction, or heauie iudgement, which


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:26956:92"/>
he hath by his sinnes pulled vppon his owne head, for the obtayning of some needfull grace, or temporall blessing, hee may omit for a season the duties of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and giue himselfe wholy to prayer. But ordinarie prayer may stand with the performance of al other duties, neither hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them, nor yet being hindered by them: so that a Christian may both serue God by prayer, and also do whatsoeuer his calling, although it be laborious, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, doth require.</p>
                        <p>This ordinarie prayer is perfourmed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter two sortes, eyther at set and certaine tymes, or else vpon occasion: as we know that it is an ordinarie thing with men to eate, drinke, and exercise themselues, both at tymes appoynted for these purposes, and also as diuers occasions do offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: so a Christian is to pray as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle willeth <hi>Timothie</hi> to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>THe vses of set prayer are manifest, for they are many, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as many as are the necessities of the soule, all which are supplied by meanes of it. But wherefore then serueth suddaine prayer? Surely for suddaine vses hapning beside a mans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and necessarily requiring this dutie of praier. As when a Christian committeth any sinne, in thought, word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or deed, straightway he desireth God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don his sin: likewise, when he receiueth any blessing from God, he giueth thanks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any delay: and likewise in all other parts of praier, as we know that the church in these latter ages hath generally taken vp this custome of praying, at the taking of meate, the which of temporall blessings is most needful, &amp; most often receiued. This kinde of praier may be performed at any time, and in anie place: for of it the apostle writeth, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>I will that the men pray in euery place, lifting vp pure hands,</hi> yea, in the midst of other affaires whatsoeuer, &amp; in the company of others: but for set praier, choise must be made of a secret place, &amp; of such a

                           </hi> fittest season for this worke, because then we are freed from all other duties, belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging either to our callings, or to our brethren, and so may without being interrupted or any way hindered, set our selues to pray vnto God, as we read <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.61, <hi>euen at midnight will I rise to praise thee, and to thinke of all thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> or at the least, to sequester our selues in the day time fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of others, as we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.63. <hi>That Isaac in the euening did walke forth into the fields, to meditate and pray.</hi> And <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.23. That Christ whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his time of prayer was come, sent the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude away, and went vp to the mountaine alone to pray, and was there alone, as also <hi>Marke</hi> 1.35. That verie earlie in the morning before day, he went into a desert, or solitarie place, and there prayed. But as for suddaine praier, he did often performe that, in the midst of other affaires, and in the companie of others, euen of the whole multitude. Thus hee prayed. <hi>Iohn</hi> 11.41.


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:26956:94"/>
vpon occasion of the myracle which hee was about to worke, in raysing <hi>Lazarus</hi> from death. Whereby it appeareth, that what with extraordinarie and ordinarie, what with set and suddaine prayer, the life of a Christian is a continuall exercise of praying, to the daylye and diligent performance whereof, he whosoeuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth to haue his soule in good estate, is to looke carefullie, least that by anye meanes hee bee drawne away, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come negligent in this behalfe, as wee see it often to come to passe, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians doo so entangle, and euen ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme themselues with worldly cares, and affayres, that they can scarce spare any time, either for extraordinarie, or for ordinarie, either for set, or for suddaine prayer. Yea, if there bee no outward hinderance, yet the slouthfulnes of the flesh vnwilling of it self to take paines, in this or any other spiritual exercise, is a sufficient hinderance, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth many cold, negligent, yea, &amp; at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth altogither careles of this duty, as we read, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.37, that the disciples of Christ, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they had this duty imposed vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the expresse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of Christ, were by drowsie sluggishnesse hindered from the performance of it: the which so farre


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:26956:94"/>
preuailed with them, that they could not get the vpper hand of it, no not when they were sharply reproued by Christ, &amp; stirred vp to prayer, for so he saith, <hi>Peter sleepest thou? coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest thou not watch one houre? Watch and pray lest ye fall into temptation: the spirit is willing but the flesh is weake.</hi> And therefore Christ spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of praying, <hi>Luc.</hi> 8.1. addeth this caue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, that they should pray and not be wearied with it. So that wee being forewarned by Christ, are to take heed least that by these or any other meanes, we bee either altogether hindered or made negligent in this exercise, wherein, as hath often beene said, the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the soule doth consist: as no doubt wee shall, if we consider and weigh the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable fruits and comfort arising of it. What ought to bee lesse irksome, or more pleasant to a Christian soule, then to haue daily companie, conuersation, conference and talke with God, his sauiour and redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, his protectour and mediator, his Lord and his God, the fountaine and full treasure of all blessings, the giuer of all good things? What ought to bee more carefully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med then that which procureth pardon for all sinnes, which remooueth all euils, which supplieth all temporall and spirituall wants, which encreaseth all graces, and preserueth

the soule in sounde and perfect health, euen as bodily exercise doth the body.

So whensoeuer wee feele our selues prone to sinne, and vntoward and sluggish in the seruice of God, if we giue our selues to this exercise of prayer, &amp; stretch out the ioints of our soules before God, we shall no doubt feele a great change in our soules, and that now they are light and able to lift vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to heauen.</p>

                        <p>THus wee see what singular force and vertue in preseruing the soule in the grace of Gods spirite, this exercise of prayer hath: and that not onely by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary blessing of God, who according to his gratious promises granteth, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer his children aske by prayer according to his will (in the which respect praier is as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for the body as for the soule, for it procureth temporall blessings, as well as spirituall graces) but also by a proper vertue inherent in it selfe. For if wee set aside the extraordinary worke of God in pouring his


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:26956:95"/>
spirit and grace into their hearts, who aske it by hearty prayer: the very action of prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er doth, although not merite, yet both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and encrease grace. In the which respect it is not of force for temporal bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, for no man can by praying enrich himselfe: onely it procureth the blessing of God vpon the labours and endeuors of a Christian, and so bringeth riches: but as for spirituall graces, it worketh not the beginning, but the continuance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of them, not onely from God, but also by it selfe, as hath beene noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and will more plainely appeare by that which followeth. For first for prayer in generall, whosoeuer giueth himselfe to a diligent vse of it, hee doth of necessitie daily enter into a serious consideration of his spirituall state, and of all things ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining vnto it, the which cannot but worke in him a great measure of grace. For as the carelesse neglect and forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of heauenly things comming from a greedie seeking, and a sensuall enioying of earthly pleasurs, bringeth a daily decrease: so the serious and continuall meditation of them, bringeth encrease of grace, the which in scripture is called watchfulnesse, as the


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:26956:96"/>
contrary neglect is drowsie sleeping: and therefore these two are vsually ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Watch and pray.</hi> As <hi>Mar.</hi> 13.33. <hi>Looke, watch and pray</hi>: and <hi>Math.</hi> 26.41 <hi>VVatch and pray, least ye fall into temptation</hi>: that is, giue your selues to prayer, and so consequently to a serious consideration of your owne estate (such as vseth to bee not in drousie heads, but in men giuen to much waking) that by this meanes you may bee strong in grace, and so enabled to resist the force of sinne. This appeareth more eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently in the particulars: for it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a man should make a full and plain confession of his sinnes before God, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him for his mercy sake in Christ to pardon them, promising and vowing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that hee will neuer againe so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please and so dishonour him, and not bee made (euen) by this confession far off from committing of sin. And if we suppose that the corruption of sinne is so strong in him, and doth so much preuaile, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his diligent praying, he stil falleth into sinne, yet that will stand true which we affirme, to wit, that diligent prayer, and the committing of sinne, will not stand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for if prayer cannot make him cease from sinning, yet his sinning will make him


<pb n="61" facs="tcp:26956:96"/>
leaue off praying, and be ashamed to open his mouth to God, or lift vp his eyes to heauen, with whom it will seeme that hee doth nothing but dallie &amp; dissemble, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising obedience, and straightway perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming rebellion, yea, to treade downe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote the bloud of Christ as a vile thing, by the which he was a little before washed and clensed from his sinnes. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise for thanksgiuing, which is another part of prayer, what heart is there that is so flintie, and so vngraciouslye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull, as not to be by the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the vnspeakeable loue and mercy of God shewed toward him, stirred vp to loue, obey and glorifie God in all things. By these meanes and many other, which may easely be gathered by these, prayer continueth and encreaseth spirituall strength, and therefore it is to haue a chiefe place in these spirituall exercises which we endeuour to describe.</p>

But as for the duties of loue and mercy, which cannot be performed without cost, the impairing of our worldly state, and diminishing of our earthly pleasures, these are not to bee found among men, but cleane laide aside as things of no necessitie, nor of any great vse in regard of saluation. But the trueth is, that the more they are neglected, the more the graces from the which they should proceede, are diminished.

Again, by obeying Gods commandements we shew and professe to the whole worlde, that we acknowledge, loue, and feare him, that we beleeue his worde, promises, and threatnings, that we hope and trust in him, whereas by neglecting those Christian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which God requireth, we shew indeed (whatsoeuer we professe in word) that wee make small reckoning of him or of his word. Secondly we ought to abound in all good workes, that so we may giue both to others, and also to get to our own co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces many arguments and pledges of true regeneration, the which cannot be knowen by any other meanes.

out the perfection of grace: yet we must endeuour to come as neare it as wee can, dayly rysing vp from strength to strength. In the which respect, the soule differeth from the bodie, the which hath a short time of life, but farre shorter of growth, and an appointed limit or periode of stature, beyonde the which it cannot bee brought, but there standeth at a stay. But as for the soule, although it also haue a sette pitch, beyonde the which it cannot go: yet because it cannot be attayned vnto in this life, therefore it is to growe continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. Yea, it beeing of so subtile a nature, and so quicke motion, is seldome or rather neuer made to stande at a stay: but if it do not increase, it doth decrease in grace. For although sometymes Christians doo so frame the course of their liues in a safe, quiet, and prudent kinde of mediocritie, that there is not in them anie sensible chaunge, in respect of godlinesse, but as they were mynded and affected, and as they liued manie yeares ago, so they go on and do still continue: yet without all question, there is some inward chaunge, eyther to the better, or which is liker, to the woorse. For, as when the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes of menne, or rather of children, do


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:26956:104"/>
not grow vp to their full and naturall sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it argueth some secret distemperature, and some naturall infirmitie in them: so when Christians do not grow on from one measure of grace to a greater, it doth of necessitie infer an euill constitution of the soule. And therfore no man ought to count it sufficient, and as much as is required at his hands, that hee doth not decrease in grace and godlinesse, but rather to thinke, as it is indeede, needeful that he growe on from grace to grace, as we are often taught and exhorted in the scripture, <hi>Ephesians</hi> the fourth chapter and fifteenth verse, <hi>Following the truth in al things, let vs grow vp in Christ who is the head in all things.</hi> And in the second Epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ninteenth verse: <hi>Let vs grow in grace and in the knowledge of Christ.</hi> This is to bee brought to passe by the same meanes, by the which the health and that measure of grace whereunto wee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie attained, is preserued: for as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of the soule is nourished by the same thing by the which it is begotten, so it is encreased by the same Diet, by the which it is nourished. For, as there is required a greater vertue and force both of nature, and of diet, to augment the


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:26956:104"/>
bodie in stature, then to keepe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it in lyfe and health: so hee that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth not onelie to continue, but also to go on in grace, must indeede vse this conseruatiue Diet of spirituall foode and exercise, which hath beene in part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, yet in a greater measure, with greater care and diligence. Here is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a free kinde of lyfe, not intangled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> much lesse ouerwhelmed with worldlie affayres, cares and encumberances, in the middest whereof, although a Christian may serue God, and worke his owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and maintaine that measure of grace, which hee hath receyued from God, yet hee cannot giue himselfe so wholie to the vse of those meanes, which are effectuall for this purpose, as is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. This free kinde of lyfe beeing got, hee is, (that wee may vse the wordes of the Apostle, in the first Epistle to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthyans,</hi> the seuenth Chapter, and fiue and thirtie verse) to cleaue to GOD, to his seruice, and to all spirituall exercises, without separation or intermission, to wit, to the hearing, reading, and studying of the worde of God, to the considering of his woorkes, and obseruing of his actions, to prayer, singing of Psalmes, to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting

By this argument the Apostle stirreth vp the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. to make a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall contribution to the Church which was in <hi>Ierusalem. He that soweth sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie shall reape sparinglie, and he that soweth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berallie shall reape liberally: for God is able to make you abound in all blessings, that you hauing sufficient may abounde to euerie good woorke</hi>: and so no doubt it is, for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer men of carnall mindes iudge it a losse and damage to doo the woorkes of loue and mercie, yet sure it is, that hee that aboundeth in them, doth heape vp


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:26956:105"/>
for himselfe, for his children and for his friendes, treasures of blessings, which hee shall certainely meete with, when as hee himselfe little thinketh of any such thing: as wee reade <hi>Eccle.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Cast thy bread on the waters, and after manie daies thou shalt finde it</hi>: By this argument which God in mercie hath giuen vnto vs for the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of our weakenesse in this behalfe, wee are to bee encouraged to go on in a daily and liberall practise of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian dueties towardes our Bretheren, and not to spare for any coste: for wee do not loose it, but only lende it to the Lorde, who will assuredly pay vs our owne with aduantage, wee shall receiue a hundred folde in this life, and a farre better rewarde in the worlde to come.

                        <p>This Motiue to good works God hath giuen vnto vs, not that we should rest in it, or that it shoulde haue the cheefe place

in this consultation: for then Sathan may obiect, agaynst vs, as hee did agaynst <hi>Iob, Doth Iob serue God for nought? hast thou not compassed him in with thy blessings</hi>? And so to vs, thou doost not serue God, or performe these Christian duties in loue, either of him or of thy brethren, or for conscience, but in a greedie desire, and a carnall hope of aduauntage. And therefore it is better, if so bee that wee can contemne and passe by this argument, not mistrusting the truth of Gods promise in this behalfe, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring simple obedience, the sincere loue of God, and the rewarde of eternall glory, before any rewarde that God can giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in this worlde. So that, to conclude this point, by these and such other motiues which the worde of God doth plentifully affoord vnto vs, wee are to stirre vp our selues, to the dayly performance of all Christian duties of loue, thankefulnesse, compassion and mercie: and to account this kinde of spirituall exercise, no lesse needfull to be dayly performed, then anie other.</p>

For why? No man as (we remaining in these earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie &amp; corruptible bodyes) can promise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himselfe continuall and certaine health, because both our knowledge, and also our care in practising is vnperfite.

promises and pretenses, or by some such meanes: so where the corruption of sin is continually working in the heart, it cannot be but that it should at one place or other, vpon one occasion or temptation or other, burst forth into open sinne. For example, a Christian is endewed by God, with the gift of continencie, by vertue whereof hee leadeth a life free from all adulterie, forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and all such vncleannes. Yet he fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth inwardly in his min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e that burning whereof the Apostle speaketh. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.9. Here are both the gift of God suppressing sinne, and also the relique of incontinency, not liuing idle, but working vehementlie, and continually: not in life and action, but inwardly in the soule. Yet where this infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie is, there somtime the outward sinne it selfe will happen. For although a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian do ordinarily keepe watch and ward ouer his soule, least that he do fall into sin, yet sometime hee will bee somewhat care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, ouercome by the force and varietie of temptation, and so fall into the sinne of vncleannesse. An other example we haue in the sayde Epistle in the Chapter following. A pagan being conuerted by the word and spirit of God, renounceth his false gods, &amp; serueth the true god, only in christ.


<pb n="89" facs="tcp:26956:110"/>
Here is the grace of GOD preuayling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the corruption of sinne, and suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it. Yet there is a relique of this sin in his minde, whereby he thinketh that his Idols, his old gods are not altogether void of power and excellency, &amp; ought to haue some kinde of worship giuen vnto them. This is the infirmity and the worke of it inwardly in his mind: yet he suppresseth it by the knowledge &amp; grace which hee hath receiued from God, so that hee is not an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Idolatour, but serueth the true God only: yet so as that he may easily be drawn by the examples and perswasions of others to giue some outward worship and honour to these false Gods. Many other instances might bee brought, but these may serue. Now that we see what a spirituall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, wee are in the next place to see how it is to be healed and remoued. Wherein there is great care and diligence to be vsed: both for that God being a spirite, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the inward purity of the soule, as well as the outward purity of life, as also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great daunger of falling into great and open sinnes, wherein this weake Christian is: Who although for a time he walke vprightly in the waies of godlinesse, yet hee is like inough to stumble and fall,

                        <p>BVt whither are these infirmities cura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or no? Surely there is no question, but that the grace of Gods spirite is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to mortifie all the corrupt lusts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of our sinful nature, whatsoeuer they be. Yea it is like inogh, that God who hath begun the good work of grace in our hearts, will perfect and accomplish it: and that as he hath cut downe the body of sin, so hee will in his good time, pull the rootes out of the ground also. There are indeede some infirmities in the faithfull, which are incurable, some which are hardly and very seldom cured. In the first sort, we are to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the originall corruption of sin, which is an infirmity, yea corrupt, as being the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and sin it selfe. This infirmity sticketh so fast in our very bones &amp; marow that it is altogether impossible to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and therefore no man ought to hope for, or to go about the totall healing of it. For although it be not impossible for God to sanctifie vs fully and wholly, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle

                        <p>Yet it doth not make a faithfull man prone and ready to the committing of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall sinnes, or backeward in seruing of GOD: For notwithstanding it, many are far off from actuall sinnes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in seruing GOD. But those spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall infirmities, in the healing whereof we are to labour, doe worke sensibly and forcibly, yea they doe in some sort pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile vsually inwardly in the faculties of the soule, and sometimes they preuayle in the outward act: originall corruption may


<pb n="92" facs="tcp:26956:112"/>
be so restrayned that it cannot worke but secretely, and without force or apparaunt effect: but these doe after a sort part stakes with grace, raigning inwardly in the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the soule, at least often, and as it were by course, howsoeuer they bee so subdued and repressed, that they seldome come to the perfection and act of sin. Yet of these infirmities whereof we speake, some are in a manner incurable, to wit: First, those which are grounded vppon some errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous opinion, the which as it is an infirmity in it selfe, so often it bringeth forth an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill custome in action, and as vsually it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inueterat is incorrigible, so is the effect which commeth of it.

God, yea euen to the last gaspe to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in earnest prayer.

                           </gap>iling of sin against grace. This definition is to bee particularly declared thus. It hath bene often sayd, that in the soule of man there are two contrary qualities, sin and holines: these two are of contrary natures, continually warring the one against the other. The field wherein this battell is fought, is the will of man,


<pb n="96" facs="tcp:26956:114"/>
the which is haled nowe to this, now to that side, at length the one getteth it, and withall the victory. For in this battell the outward action (which proceedeth wholly from the will, for that a man willeth, that he doth) is the victory: which if it be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, then sinne hath preuailed: if sin take the repulse, and cannot be brought forth, then grace hath preuayled and gotten the victory, there is the infirmity of the soule: but if sinne preuaile, there is a greeuous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease of the soule. Yet not any preuayling of sinne, but the ordinary preuayling of it maketh a spirituall sickenesse. For it hath bene sayd, that euen in spirituall infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, sinne is sometimes brought forth, but not vsually or ordinarely: As <hi>Noahs</hi> drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, <hi>Lots</hi> incest, <hi>Dauids</hi> murther and adultery were not ordinary, but happened perhaps but once in all the time of their liues, and therefore these sinnes argued not any diseases, but infirmities in their soules. Thus we see what spirituall disease is: the kindes of it are two, totall and particular, the one stretcheth it selfe ouer the whole soule of man, making a sensible decrease in all the partes of his holinesse, the other resteth in some part, as it commeth to passe in bodily diseases, whereof some goe ouer


<pb n="97" facs="tcp:26956:114"/>
the whole body, as feuers, consumptions, leprosies: and many other are but in one part, as the plurisie in the side, the goute in the feete, and such like. Of the former kind, there especially are three: Wherof the first may be called security or impenitency. The second worldlines. The third distrust. For the first, although totall impenitency cannot bee in a man regenerate (for where faith &amp; repentance are once truly wrought by God spirite, there they abide for euer) yet whensoeuer he continueth in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grosse sins, contrary to his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conscience, as the faithfull som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doe, then he is impenitent in respect of those sins. Indeed vsually when hee first beginneth to commit sin, hee doth straight way by repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance recouer his former state, flying to God in humble praier for pardon of it, and for grace, wherby to resist it. This he obtaineth at the hands of God, who, as the father of the prodigall young man, in the Gospell, is more ready to giue pardon and grace, then he is to aske it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he meeteth, &amp; in a manner preuenteth him with it. Yet sometimes afterward it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to passe, that he falleth into the same s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:26956:115"/>
backeward and vnwilling to goe to God for helpe as before, either being ashamed to aske that againe, which hee so lately ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned, and so carelesly lost, or perhaps despayring of attaining it, although hee should aske it: Or lastly, being so inueigled and besotted with the pleasure of the sin, that he resolueth with him self to continue in it: and so thinketh (and that truely) that it is in vaine, or rather impossible for him to repent of that sinne, wherein hee is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to continue. Whereuppon he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on from day to day, from year to yeare in his sinne, neuer calling him selfe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it, and scarse once thinking of leauing it, till at length hee become so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed and hard-hearted in it, that hee can not repent of it, thogh he would, hee can not powre foorth teares of sorrow and griefe, as he did at the first.</p>
                        <p>Thus he affected in his conscience, in respect of his sinne, doth in a manner giue ouer all holy and spirituall exercises, as the hearing, meditating, reading and conferring of the word of God, publick &amp; priuat prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and all other meanes seruing for edific<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If it so fall forth, that his conscience be stirred vp by the ministery of the word, by some iudgement, or any other meanes, so that hee purposeth and desireth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and to leaue his sinne, yet he findeth him selfe so vntoward to this worke, and so hard hearted, vnable to call vpon God in hope of being heard, that hee giueth it ouer at the first, and so is further of then he was. This is a kinde of impenitency, the which that it is a disease spreading it self o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the whole soule of man wee can not doubt: it may well bee compared to that sickenesse, wherein men lie for dead for many houres together, so that it can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be perceiued that they draw breath. It commeth of the committing of and yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to great and haynous sinnes, such whereof a mans conscience telleth him, that they cannot possibly stand with the feare and seruice of GOD, but that of necessity the one must bee left off and laid aside.</p>
                        <p>The cure of it consisteth in the practise of the whole doctrine of repentance, for in it a man is brought almost to that estate, wherein hee was before regeneration, so that now as it is, <hi>Hebrues.</hi> 6.1. Hee must lay againe the foundation of repentance


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:26956:116"/>
from dead works. He must enter into a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious consideration of that fearefull estate wherein he is: wherof it will certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that he wil neuer please himselfe in it, or be content till hee finde some remedy. The which is to be sought at the handes of God by earnest prayer, by auoyding all occasions of those sinnes, which haue thus preuayled ouer him, and by forcing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe although most vntoward, to the daily vse of all holy &amp; spiritual exercises, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the graces of Gods spirite may be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led &amp; stirred vp in him. An example both of this impenitency, and also of this renued repentance, wee haue in the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> who by committing two haynous sins adultery and murther, fell into this estate, and therein continued for some time, and by the grace of God was recouered out of it, as we read <hi>Ps.</hi> 51.10. <hi>Creat in me a cleane heart o God, and renue a right spirit within me: cast me not from thy presence, and take not thy holy spirit from me.

If it be asked whether that one truly regenerate can be wholy destitute of any grace, &amp; if hee may, what difference there is betwixt him and a carnall man? we answere, that regeneration is the roote, and the possibilitie, but not the act of all graces: as a liuing bodie, although naturally it bee thee subiect of sense, yet some one part of it may be benummed and senslesse: so the soule of one regenerate, hath in it at least the beginnings and seedes of all graces, howsoeuer some of them at some tymes doo not woorke or appeare: whereas a carnall man is altogither desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, yea, vncapable of them. Among these

Conceate, is a fonde opinion which a man hath of his own excellency in respect of others, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming himselfe more iust, wise, and holy, then any other, and therefore more highly in Gods fauour, and more worthie to bee honoured among men. This proceedeth from that selfe loue, which is naturally in euery man, (yea, in euery liuing thing) by the which he is mooued to desire, and to endeuour the aduancing of himselfe, and the bettering of his owne estate: for the which purpose hee hath his minde conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually set and fixed on those thinges, wherein his excellencie doth consist: and so fitting his opinion to his desire and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thinketh them to bee mo and greater, and himselfe more excellent in respect of them, then he is in deed. Thus are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carnall men in regarde of outward bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and naturall gifts, but euen the godly often puffed vp in pride, in regard of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall graces, seeing themselues to be aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to so high a dignitie, as far passing the common condition of men, as the heauen is higher then the earth, as wisdom is better

then folly, light then darkenesse, holinesse then sinfulnesse, and happinesse then eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall miserie. Yea, as they haue a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge of their owne gifts and graces, which they feele wrought, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in their heartes and liues, then of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, which they but coniecture: and of other mens wants, infirmities, sinnes and faults, then of their owne, wherof they cannot abide to thinke or heare: so they thinke farre better of themselues, then of others. This corruption dooth manie wayes shewe forth it selfe, as namely, in insolent talke and behauior, in obstinate maintaining of erroneous opinions, and vnlawfull or vnmeete practises, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in contempt of our brethren, their companie, giftes, opinions, in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But it is carefully to bee resisted and auoyded, as beeing displeasing, yea, odious to GOD, who resisteth the proude, and giueth grace to the humble, and in whose eyes, nothing is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable then a meeke and lowlie spirite: as also hurtfull to our selues, in that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs obstinate and incorrigible in errors and sinnes, and depriueth vs of that good and comfort, which might bee reaped by


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:26956:121"/>
the giftes and companie of our brethren, whereof wee may reape great profite and comfort.</p>
                        <p>The remedie of this disease, is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, not of our gifts and graces, but of our wayes &amp; sinnes, the which no doubt will pull downe these peacockes feathers, and make vs base, yea, vile in our owne eies. By this reason the Apostle exhorteth the Romans. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. not to be drunke and besotted with any great conceate of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but rather to thinke soberly and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly of themselues, for that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his graces, not all to any one, least hee should haue matter of pride, but some to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie one, that none should bee subiect to the contempt of others. Wherein the great wisedome and godnesse of God, is to be considered, praised, and admired, who doth so temper his graces bestowed on the faithfull, with their owne wants and sinnes, that neither the one is able to lift vppe the minde too high in vaine conceates, nor the other to presse it downe too lowe with disgrace, but supplyeth the greatest wantes with other most excellent and rare giftes, and qualifyeth the abundance of grace, with some great want or grieuous sinne, as wee are taught by the examples

                        <p>THe second disease of the minde is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the which vsually commeth of conceate, and dooth accompanie it. Where we do not meane any light errours in matters of small importance, for no man either is, or can bee free from these, as long as he is in this world: but such as are neare about the foundation and substance of Christian Religion, &amp; which may seeme to endaunger a mans saluation, as about Christ his incarnation, passio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, natures, about the manner or matter of our iustification, the Church or Sacraments, or any other waightie poynt. Yet not any such errour maketh a spirituall disease, but onely when as it hapneth in a time of light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, wherein the contrarie truth is both plainly reuealed by God, and also general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or at least commonly acknowledged by the Church. Otherwise, if it be a time of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and darknesse, wherein that truth is reuealed, the most grieuous errour that


<pb n="113" facs="tcp:26956:122"/>
is, doth not argue the distemperature of the soule, or make a spirituall disease: as we know, no man accounteth him either blind or ill sighted, who cannot see and discerne things in the night, or in the darke dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: or him to bee of an euill constitution of body, who is infected with a common sicknesse or plague. But it commeth often to passe, that the faithfull are ignoraunt, when they might see the truth, it being by others seene and acknowledged. In this case great errors argue an euill constitution of the mind &amp; an vnsound iudgement: yea they make our regeneration to be doubted of, and cald into question: For this is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a mind sanctified and enlightned by Gods spirit, if not to search and find out the truth, when it is vnknowen, yet to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and receiue it, when it is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But notwithstanding all this, it cannot be denied, (for the experience of all ages doth witnesse it) that men truely regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, may both liue and die in great and most dangerous errours, yea when as the truth is both expounded to them by others, and also sought for by their owne labour and continuall study. The remedie of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease consisteth in these things. First, that wee suspect our selues in those opinions


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:26956:123"/>
wherein wee disagree from those who are godly and learned: knowing that they haue the spirite of God to leade and guide them into all truth as well as wee. Secondly, in knowing that God doth often suffer them to fall into gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The third &amp; last of those diseases which


<pb n="115" facs="tcp:26956:123"/>
are most vsual in the mind, &amp; which we wil here mention, is the ignorance of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular prouidence of God, &amp; of his rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding euery one, euen in this life according to his works: for many Christians although they be perswaded, that God will in his v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersal iudgement reward both the godly with eternall g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is a petty Atheisme, many wayes hurtfull to the soule, and therefore by all meanes to be auoided: it taketh from them the feare of Gods iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which should be a bridle to restraine them from sin, yea the hope of reward for good works, by the which they should bee pulled forward to the chearfull performance of them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the word of God techeth (as experience also will without doubt testifie to him that will obserue the doings of God) that hee noteth as it were in a day booke, euen their least actions both good and euill, yea the most secret motions of their mindes, and suffereth none of them to go vnrecompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, yea he recompenceth euery worke in the owne kinde, inflicting a punishment


<pb n="116" facs="tcp:26956:124"/>
like vnto the sinne, and giuing a blessing to the good work, that it may be knowen, that the one doth belong, and is to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the other.</p>
                        <p>The diseases happening vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science are many, but of them all, the most vsuall is the false testimony of it, excusing where it should accuse. For seeing that it doth manifestly appeare, that in the liues of many Christians, there are many things vnlawfull and contrary to Gods word, wee must of necessity graunt, that either they sinne wittingly against the testimony of the conscience, or which is more agreeable to charity, &amp; therfore rather to be thoght, that their consciences are false witnesses, affirming euill to be good, and good to be euill. Hereof it commeth, that many chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians thinke it lawfull for them to dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, lie, and glose, in their dealings and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires with their bretheren, when as their profit &amp; adua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tage do so require: that they may giue the time appointed, or at the least due to holy exercises, and to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God, to eating, drinking, sleepe, pastime, company, trafficke, and to any worldly pleasure or profite: that they need not practise any duties of loue, pitty, or thankfulnesse to their bretheren, but in all


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:26956:124"/>
things regard, and doe that onely which standeth with their owne profite. And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when as they doe those things which they know and thinke to be vnlawfull, yet this lying witnesse beareth them in hand, that God will winke at these scapes, and in a manner allow them to doe so: and so they draw God into the society of their sinne, making him as it were the receauer of their theft, and thinking of him that hee is like vnto themselues.</p>
                        <p>This disease is diligently to be searched out, by examining our consciences and liues by the rule of the word, and lawe of God, which will not lie: And in those ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, whereof we cannot attaine to any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine knowledge of the truth, to abstaine from action, till GOD giue vnto vs some ground whereon to leane: thinking it far better to abstaine from many things, yea although it be to our trouble and losse, then to doe any thing in a doubtfull &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering minde: much lesse then, to sin pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously against God, by doing that which we know to be vnlawfull. We must in this case learne to remoue all those props whereon this false witnes doth rely it selfe, as namely: First the priuiledge of Christian liberty, vnder pretence wherof, many take

But we know, or els we are to learne, that the Gospell doth not abrogate any iot or title of the lawe: that Christ hath freed vs from the curse, but not from the obedience of it. Yea that our liberty in things indifferent and lawfull, is to be restrayned, and kept within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of conueniency, and the spirituall edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our selues and our bretheren in godlinesse, the which if we doe neglect, we transgresse the lawe, euen in doing that which otherwise is permitted by the law.</p>
                        <p>The second proppe, whereon this lying witnesse leaneth, are the examples of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and godly men, endued with a great measure of knowledge, and of all spirituall graces, and therefore worthy to bee made patterns for others to behold and imitate, who haue practised, defended, allowed, or tolerated that which we alledge against the receyued opinion and practise of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be lawfull. But neither will this serue the turne, for no mans life is a law: the best men doe sometimes goe astray, yet they must then goe alone, and not lead others out of the way.</p>

                        <p>By these infirmities and diseases of the soule, we may gather the rest, and learne to auoide and heale them, to our vnspeakea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble comfort and eternall saluation.</p>
