            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CAP. I. Of the generall meanes of ruling the tongue.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE government of the tongue is a vertue pertaining to the holy usage of the tongue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods worde.</p>
            <p>And for the well ordering of it, two things are requisite: a pure heart, and skill in the language of Canaan.</p>
            <p>The pure heart is most necessarie,<note place="margin">Matt. 15.19.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the fountaine of speech, and if the fountaine be defiled, the streames that issue thence can not be cleane.</p>
            <p>And because the heart of man by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7570:4"/>
nature is a bottomlesse gulfe of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, two things are to be knowen: first, howe it must be made pure: and then howe it is alwayes afterwarde to be kept pure.</p>
            <p>The way to get a pure heart, is this. First, thou must seriously examine thy life and thy conscience for all thy sinnes past then with a heavie and bleeding heart confesse them to God, utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning thy selfe. Thirdly, with deepe sighes and grones of spirite crye unto heauen to God the Father in the name of Christ for pardon, I say, for pardon of the same sinnes, as it were for life and death, and that, day and night, till the Lord send downe from heauen a sweete certificate into the perplexed conscience by his holy spirite, that all thy sinnes are done away. Nowe at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in which pardon shall be graunted, God likewise will once againe stretch forth that mightie hand of his, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he made thee when thou wast not, to make thee a newe creature, to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a newe heart in thee, to renewe a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7570:4"/>
right spirite in thee, and to stablish thee by his free spirite. For whome he justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, them also at the same time he san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth.</p>
            <p>The purified heart appeareth by these signes. I. If thou feele thy selfe to be displeased at thine owne infirmities and corruptions, and to droupe under them as men doe under bodily sicknesse. II. If thou beginne to hate and to flie thine owne personall sinnes. III. If thou feele a griefe and sorow after that thou hast offended God. IIII. If thou hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily desire to abstaine from all manner of sinne. V. If thou be carefull to auoid all occasions and intisements to euill. VI. If thou trauell and doe thine indeauour in euery good thing. VII. If thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and pray to God to wash and rinse thine heart in the blood of Christ.</p>
            <p>When the heart is pure, to keep it so is the speciall worke of faith, <hi>which puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the heart.</hi>

            <p>Faith purifieth the heart by a particular applying of Christ crucified with all his merites. <note n="b" place="margin">2. kin. 4.34.</note> 
               <hi>Elisha when hee went up and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7570:5"/>
lay upon the dead childe, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes upon his eies, and his hands vpon his hands; and stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him selfe upon him, the flesh of the childe waxed warme. Afterward Elisha rose and spread him selfe upon him the second time:</hi>
               <note place="margin">vers. 35.</note> 
               <hi>then the child neesed seaven times and opened his eies.</hi> So must a man by faith even spread himselfe upon the crosse of Christ, applying hands and feete to his pearced hands and his feet, and his wretched heart to Christes bleeding heart, and then hee shall feele him selfe warmed by the heat of Gods spirite, and sinne from daie to daie crucified with Christ, and his dead heart quickened and reviued. And this applying which faith maketh, is done by a kinde of reasoning, which faith maketh thus. Hath God of his mercie given his owne Sonne to be my saviour, to shed his blood for mee? and hath hee of his mercie graunted unto mee the pardon of all my sinnes? I will therefore endeavoure to keepe my heart and my life unblameable that I doe not offende him hereafter in worde or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7570:5"/>
deede, as I have done heretofore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The language of Canaan</hi> is,<note place="margin">Isa. 19.18. Rom. 15.6.</note> whereby a man endewed with the spirite of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unfainedly calleth upon the Name of God in Christ, and so consequently doth as it were, familiarly talke and speake with God. This language must needes be learned, that the tongue may be well governed. For man must first be able to talke with God, before he can be able wisely to talke with man. For this cause when men are to have communication one with another, they are first of all to be carefull that they often make their prayers to God that he would guide and blesse them in their speeches, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> did: <hi>Set a watch, O Lorde,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psalm. 141.3.</note>

               <note place="margin">Psalm. 51.17.</note> 
               <hi>and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.</hi> where we may see, that the mouth is, as it were, loc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked up fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> speaking any good thing, untill the Lord open it.

            <head>CAP. II. Of the matter of our speech.</head>
            <p>THe gouernment of the tongue containeth two parts: Holy speech, and holy silence. In holy speech must be considered the matter of our speech and the manner.</p>
            <p>The matter is commonly one of these three: either God, our neighbour, or our selues.</p>
            <p>As concerning God, this caueat must be remembred, that the honourable ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of his glorious Majestie be neuer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into our mouthes, unlesse it be upon a weightie and just occasion, so as we may plainly see that glorie will redound to him thereby: and for this cause the thirde commandement was giuen, that men might not <hi>take up the Name of God in vaine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 20.7.</note> that is, rashly and lightly.</p>
            <p>And therefore lamentable and fearefull
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7570:6"/>
is the practise euery where. For it is a common thing with men to begin their speech, and to place the titles of Gods most high Majestie in the forefront al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of euery sentence, by saying, <hi>O Lorde! O God! O good God! O mercifull God! O Iesu! O Christ! &amp;c.</hi> If a man be to say any thing, he will not say <hi>Yea,</hi> or <hi>Nay</hi>: but, <hi>O Lorde yea,</hi> or <hi>O Lorde nay.</hi> If a man be to reprooue his inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he will presently say, <hi>O Lorde have mercie on vs, what a sloubacke art thou? what a lye is this, &amp;c.</hi> An earthly Prince, if he should haue his name tossed in our mouthes at euery worde, would neuer beare it, and how shall the euerliuing God suffer it? nay, how can he suffer it? I say no more, but thou with thy selfe thinke how: for in the third comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement the punishment is set downe, <hi>that he will not hold him guiltlesse that taketh his Name in vaine.</hi> And the Angels in reuerence to Gods Majestie couer their faces, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.2.</p>
            <p>Concerning our neighbour, we are to consider whether the thing which wee
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7570:7"/>
are about to speake be good or evill.</p>
            <p>This being weighed, if it be good, and so commendable, then we are readily and cheerefully, and that upon every occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ro utter it, especially in his absence, whether he be a friend or a foe: as <hi>S. Iohn</hi> writeth of <hi>Demetrius. Demetrius</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath good report of all men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Ioh. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and of the trueth it selfe: yea, and we our selves beare recorde, and ye knowe that our testimonie is true.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the evill which any man shall knowe by his neighbour, he is in no wise to speake of it, whether it be an infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or a grosse sinne, unlesse in his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he shall finde him selfe called of God to speake.</p>
            <p>A man is called to speake in three cases: I. when he is called before a magistrate, &amp; is lawfully required to testifie the evill which he knoweth by another. II. when any is to admonish his brother of any fault for his amendement. III. when the hurt or daunger that may arise of the evill is to be prevented in others. As a man may say to one well disposed, take heede of such a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7570:7"/>
mans company: for he is given to such or such a vice.</p>
            <p>To this ende, they of <hi>the house of Cloe</hi> doe certifie <hi>Paul</hi> of the disorders in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.11.</note> And <hi>Ioseph certifieth his father of his brethrens slaunders.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gene. 37.2.</note> In this case all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are to be revealed, as tending to the ruine of the whole Common-wealth. Thus <hi>Elisha revealeth the secret of the King of Syria.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Kin. 6.8.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:7570:8"/>In the manner of our speaking, three thinges are to be pondered: What must be done before we speake: what in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: what after we have spoken.</p>
            <p>Before we speake, consideration must be used of the thing to be spoken, and of the end. <hi>Iames</hi> requireth that men <hi>should be slowe to speake, and swift to heare.</hi>

The tongue is the messenger of the heart, and therefore as oft as we speake without meditation going before, so oft the messenger runneth without his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. The tongue is placed in the middle of the mouth, <note n="a" place="margin">

            <head>CAP. IIII. What is to be done in speaking; and of wisedome.</head>
            <p>WHEN we are in speaking, two thinges are to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: first, care must be had of the speach, that it be <hi>gratious</hi>: secondly, it is to be uttered with convenient bondes of trueth.</p>
            <p>The speech is gratious, when it is so uttered,<note place="margin">Col. 4.6.</note> that the graces of God wrought in the heart by the holy Ghost, are as it were pictured and painted foorth in the same: for speach is the very image of the heart.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Ephe. 4.25. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>Contrarie to this is <hi>rotten speach,</hi> that is, all such talke as is voide of grace, which is the heart and pith of our speach.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:7570:9"/>And by this it appeareth, <note n="u" place="margin">Eph. 5.3. Psal. 16.4.</note> that no vice can be named but with disliking: &amp; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in Scriptures when by occasion a vice should be named, in token of a loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereof, the name of the vice is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and the name of the contrarie ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue used in the roome thereof, as in these wordes: <note n="w" place="margin">Iob. 1.5. 1. Kin. 21.10.</note> 
               <hi>For Iob thought: It may be that my sonnes have sinned and blessed,</hi> that is, <hi>blasphemed God.</hi> This being true, then by proportion the visible representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vices of men in the worlde, which is the substance and matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of playes and enterludes are made, is much more to be avoyded.</p>
            <p>Gods graces, which we are to shewe foorth in our communication, are these: Wisedome, Trueth, Reverence,<note place="margin">1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.</note> Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, Meekenesse, Sobrietie in judgement, Vrbanitie, Fidelitie, Care of others good name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but let us consider of them in order.</p>
            <p>Wisedome in our speach is a goodly ornament. The Apostles when they wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Holy Ghost in Hierusalem, it descended upon them in the forme
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7570:10"/>
of fiery tongues:<note place="margin">Act. 2.4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Prov. 6.23.</note> &amp; then it is said that <hi>they spake as the holy Ghost gave them uttera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in Apophthegmes or wise sentences.</hi> And he that governeth his tongue wisely, <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth doctrine to the lips,</hi> that is, so spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, as that others be made wise thereby.</p>
            <p>This wisedome is then shewed, when a man can in judgement apply his talke, and, as it were in good maner make it fit to all the circumstances of persons, times, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">Prov. 19.11.</note> thinges. <hi>A foole powreth out all his mind: but a wise man keepeth in till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde. A worde spoken in his place, is like apples of golde with pictures of silver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now he that would have his speach to be wise, must first of all him selfe become a wise man. And the wise man of whome the holy Scriptures speake, is a godly man, and such an one as feareth God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this feare of God is the <hi>beginning and head of wisedome</hi>:<note place="margin">Prov. 1.7. eccles. 12.13. Psal. 14.1. &amp; 38.5. Gene.</note> as on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the foole, whereof the Scripture often speaketh, is the ungodly person, that maketh no conscience of any sinne. And indeede such a one is the most sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse foole of all. He that shall ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:7570:10"/>
be casting him selfe into the fire and water, and runne upon daungerous pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to breake his legges, armes, necke: and further shal take pleasure in doing al this, is either a foole or a mad man. Now the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly man as oft as he sinneth, he indevou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth as much as in him lieth to pitch his soule into hel, &amp; wheras he taketh pleasure in sinne, he sports him selfe with his owne destruction. Furthermore the man fearing God must have two things in his heart: a perswasion of Gods presence, and Awe.</p>
            <p>The perswasion of Gods presence is, whereby a man is continually resolved, that wheresoeuer he is, he standeth before God, who doeth see even into the secrets of his heart. This was in <hi>Cornelius:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 10.33.</note> 
               <hi>Now therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>we are in Gods presence to heare all things that are commaunded thee of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Awe in regard of God, is that whereby a man behaveth him selfe reuerently, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is in Gods presence.</p>
            <p>Awe is either in regard of sinne, or of chastisements.</p>
            <p>Awe in respect of sinne, is when one is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7570:11"/>
afraide to sinne, fearing not so much the punishment, as sinne it selfe, because it is sinne. For he feareth God indeede, which is of this minde, that if there were no Iudge to condemne him; no hell to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him no Divell nor conscience to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him; yet he would not sinne, because Gods blessed Majestie is by it offended and displeased: and if he had it in his choyce, whether he would sinne or loose his life, he had rather dye then willingly and wittingly sinne against God. This awe being in <hi>Ioseph,</hi> was the cause that mooved him not to commit follie with <hi>Putiphars</hi> wife. <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 39.9.</note> 
               <hi>How then,</hi> saith he, <hi>can I doe this great wickednesse, and sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God</hi>?</p>
            <p>Awe in chastisements is, when one humbleth him selfe under the mightie hande of God with all meekenesse and patience, when God layeth his hande on him more or lesse. When <hi>Shemi</hi> came foorth and cursed <hi>David,</hi> and flung stones at him, what did he? truely he stoode in awe of God, and therefore saide, <note n="d" place="margin">2. Sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 16.10.</note> 
               <hi>What have I to doe with you, ye sonnes of Zer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viah?
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7570:11"/>
for he curseth, even because the Lorde hath bidden him curse David, who dare then say, wherefore hast thou done so?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When a man is thus made wise, that is, righteous and fearing God, he is so gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the spirite of feare, that he can not but speake wisely. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <note n="e" place="margin">Prov. 10.31.</note> 
               <hi>The lippes of the righteous knowe what is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowarde thinges.</hi> And againe, <hi>The heart of the wise guideth the mouth wisely.</hi> Contrarie to this is fond and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish talke, an example hereof we have in <hi>Luke,</hi> where <hi>Pilate</hi> wanting the feare of God, saith, <hi>I finde no fault in Christ: let us therefore chastise him,</hi>

            <p>TRVETH of speach is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereby a man speaketh as he thinketh: and so consequently, he speaketh as every thing is, so farre forth
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7570:12"/>
as possiblie he can. It is made a note of a righteous man, <hi>to speake the trueth from the heart:</hi>

               <hi>and they that deale truely are Gods delight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is alwayes required in all our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines; accusations, defences, testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, promisses, bargainings, counsels: but especially in Iudges and Magistrates sitting on judgement seate,<note place="margin">Prov. 17.7.</note> because then they stand in Gods steade, who is trueth it selfe.</p>
            <p>To this place belongeth <hi>Apollogie,</hi> which is,<note place="margin">Matt. 10.32.</note> when a Christian called before a Magistrate, and straightly examined of his religion, confesseth Christ boldly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth not the trueth.</p>
            <p>Contrary to this, is Lying, Cogging, Glosing, Smoothing, dissembling: As for example,<note place="margin">1. Kin. 5.25.</note> 
               <hi>Gehazi,</hi> after hee had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived money and garments of <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> against <hi>Elis<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

whither.</hi> To the like effect and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, report is made of a rich man that had two chestes: the one whereof he calleth <hi>all the worlde</hi>; the other, <hi>his friende.</hi> In the first hee putteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: in the seconde he putteth all his substance. When his neighbour came to borrowe money, he useth to answere, truely I have never a penny in all the worlde, meaning his emptie chest, but I will see (saith he) what my friend can doe, looking thereby for interest by the money out of his other chest.</p>
            <p>This vice is very common, and it is a rare thing to finde a man that maketh a conscience of a lye.</p>
            <p>Lying is when a man speaketh o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then the trueth is, with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to deceive. Here note that there is great difference betweene these two speeches, <hi>It is an untrueth</hi>; and, <hi>It is a lye.</hi> The first may be used when a man speaketh falshoodes. But in using the seconde, we must be heedie and sparing: for when a man is challenged for a lye, three thinges are layde to his charge. I
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7570:13"/>
That he speaketh falsely. II. That he is willing to doe so. III. That he hath a desire and purpose to deceive.</p>

            <p>As trueth is required in speech, so also reuerence to God and man.</p>
            <p>Reuerence to God is, when we so speak of God and use his titles, that wee shew reuerence our selues, and mooue reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in others. <note n="a" place="margin">Deu. 28.58.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Here take heede of all maner of blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming, which is, when men use such speeches of God, as doe either detract any thing from his Majestie, or ascribe any thing to him, not beseeming him: A sinne of all to be detested. Reasons. I. A blasphemer is viler then the rest of the creatures: for they praise God in their kinde, and shew foorth his power, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and wisdome: but he dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God in his wretched speech. II. Hee is as the madde dogge that flyeth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7570:14"/>
in his masters face, who keepeth him and giueth him bread. III. Custome in blasphemies sheweth a man to be the child of the deuill, and no child of God as yet. A father lying on his death bed cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the three children to him which hee kept, and tolde them that onely one of them was his owne sonne, and that the rest were onely brought up by him: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unto him hee gaue all his goods: but which of these three was his naturall sonne he would not in any wise declare. When hee was deade, euery one of the three children pleaded that hee was the sonne, and therefore that the goods were his. The matter being brought before a Iudge could not be ended: but the Iudge was constrained to take this course: hee caused the dead corpes of the father to be set up against a tree, and commaunded the three sonnes to take bowes and arrowes, and to, shoote against their father and to see who could come neerest the heart. The first and seconde did shoote at their father and hitte him, the thirde was angrie
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7570:14"/>
with both the other and refused to shoot. This done, the Iudge gaue sentence that the two first were no sonnes, but the third onely, and that he should haue the goods. The like triall may be used to know who be Gods children. Such persons with whome blaspheming is rife, are very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils incarnate, and the children of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, who rend God in pieces, and shoote him through with their dartes, as it is said of the Egyptian when hee blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,<note place="margin">Levit. 24.11. <hi>vaijkkobh.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>hee smote or pierced through Gods Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, here wee must be warned to take heede of that customable swearing, and also of perjurie. It is a very strange sinne: for the perjured person doeth not onely sinne himselfe, but withall he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth to intangle God in the same sinne with himselfe.</p>
            <p>Further, take heede least thou doest ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make or recite the jestes which are contrived out of the phrases of Scripture: which are very many and verie usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rehearsed in companie.<note place="margin">Exod. 30.31.</note> The oyle wherewith the tabernacle and the arke of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7570:15"/>
the testament and the Priestes were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, was holy: and therefore no man might put it to any other uses, as to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint his owne flesh therewith, or to make the like unto it. <note n="b" place="margin">Iohn 19.8.</note> Pilate a poore Painyme when he heard the name of the Sonne of God <hi>was afraid</hi>: and we much more ought to tremble at the word of God, not to make our selves merry with it. And therefore the scoffing of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata is very fearefull, who was wont to reach Christians boxes on the eare, and with all, bidde them turne the other, and obey their masters comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>Whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheeke,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 5.39.</note> 
               <hi>turne to him the other also.</hi> And he denied pay and like reward to his souldiers that were Christians, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saide he would make them fitte for the kingdome of heauen, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that Christ had said, <hi>Blessed are the poore in spirite:</hi>

               <hi>for theirs is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here also men must learne to take heed of all manner of charmes and inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which commonly are nothing
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7570:15"/>
else but words of scripture or such like, used for the curing of paines and disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses both in men and beastes.

But the truth is, such kinde of practises are deuilish. Patrones of charmes holde that in such wordes as are either diuine or barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, is much efficacie. But whence is this efficacie? From God? from men? or from the deuill? If it shall be saide from God, we must knowe that the worde used in holy maner, is the instrument of God to convey unto us spirituall blessings, as faith, regeneration, repentance: but it doeth not serve to bring unto us corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall health. Well then, belike wordes take vertue from the speaker, and are made powerfull by the strength of his imagination.<note place="margin">

               </note> Indeed of this opinion are some Phisitians, as <hi>Avicenna</hi> and <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus,</hi> who thinke that phantasie is like to the sunne, which worketh on all things
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7570:16"/>
to which his beames doe come: and the latter that by imagination miracles may be wrought. But this opinion is fonde and the reasons alledged for it are without weight. For imaginations are no things but shadowes of things. And as an image of a man in a glasse hath no power in it, but only serves to resemble &amp; represent the bodie of a man: so it is with the phantasie and conceit of the minde &amp; no otherwise. And if imagination haue any force, it is only within the spirits and humours of a mans owne bodie: but to give force to worke in the bodies of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it can not; no more then the shadow of one bodie can ordinarily cure the body of another on which it lighteth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore words used in the way of bodily cure, be they in they in them selues never so good, are no better then the deuils sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: and when they are used of blinde people, he it is, that comming under hand, worketh the cure, &amp; by turning himselfe into an Angell of light, deludes them. But it were better for a man to die a thousand times then to use such remedies, which in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:7570:16"/>
curing the body, destroy the soule.</p>
            <p>Lastly, avoid all imprecations and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings either against men or other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: For God in judgement, to punish such cursed speaking, often brings to passe such imprecations: as may appeare in the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who at the arraignment of Christ, cryed saying,<note place="margin">Matt. 27.25.</note>

            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:7570:17"/>Reuerence to man is in two respects, either because he is created after the image of God, or because he is aboue us in age, giftes, authority.</p>
            <p>In the first consideration, men must haue care to giue such names to children as are proper and fit, usuall and knowne: the signification whereof, may admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them of the promises of God, of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, or of some good duty. And there be foure allowed endes of giving names. I. To preserue the memory of some thing by the name giuen, as <hi>Adam, Israell, Isaac.</hi> II. To signifie some thing to come, as <hi>Evah, Abraham, Iohn, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> III. To preserue the name and memorie of parentes and kindred, which was used in the birth of <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi> This custome may still be retained, if there be any good example in the ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours that the childe may follow. IIII. That the life and profession of good men may be revived in the renuing of their names.</p>
            <p>Here we must take heed, in no wise to giue to children, the proper names or

titles of God, as <hi>Iesus, Immanuel, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither are the professours of the Gospell to be intituled by the names of such as have beene famous instruments in the Church, as to be called <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists, Lutheranes, &amp;c. Now this I say,</hi>

            <p>And it is a bold part of the pestilent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Papistes, who take to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the name of <hi>Iesuites,</hi>

            <p>Secondly, in the mentioning of things which moove blushing, we are to use as seemely wordes as may be chosen.

remembrance &amp;c. that they be courteous,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Meekenesse and gentlenesse shewes it selfe in Salutations, Answeres and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes.</p>
            <p>For the first, daily experience shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that it maketh much for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of love, to call men by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per names or surnames. And this was a signe of speciall favour that God called <hi>Moses</hi> by his proper name. Yet more convenient it is, to salute our betters by names of honour or office. Thus the disciples call our Saviour Christ <hi>Rabbi</hi>: and it was the usuall manner among the Iewes, to call their betters <hi>Adon,</hi> that is, Lorde, or syr.</p>
            <p>The formes of salutations are to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order practised in scripture. An Angell saluted <hi>Gedeon</hi> thus: <hi>The Lorde be with thee thou valiant man.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iud. 6.12.</note> And <hi>Boaz</hi> came to <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and said to the repers, <hi>The Lorde be with you</hi>:<note place="margin">Ruth. 2.4.</note> and they answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>The Lorde blesse thee.</hi> And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7570:19"/>
saluted <hi>Mary: Haile, freely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the Lorde is with thee, &amp;c.</hi> Christ comming among his disciples, saide, <hi>Peace be among you</hi>: and he taught them comming to any house to say,<note place="margin">Matt. 10.11, 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>Peace be to this house.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this it appeareth, that our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon formes of salutations are commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable: which are of divers sortes: as when one meetes another, <hi>God save you</hi>: when one goes away, <hi>God be with you</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the morning, <hi>God give you a good mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>: after noone, <hi>God give you a good evening</hi>: when one is going on his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>God speede your journey</hi>: when one is working, <hi>God speede you</hi>: in eating, <hi>much good doe it you</hi>: when one hath a new of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>God give you joy of your office</hi>: when one is sicke, <hi>God comfort you, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when children salute their fathers and mothers after this manner: <hi>I pray you father blesse me, I pray you mother blesse me</hi>: it is a seemely thing. For God hath made parents to be the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of blessing to their children in nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toring them and praying for them. As
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7570:20"/>

considering our selves, that wee also are in daunger of the same fault: and partly by framing the reproofe out of the worde of God, that the partie may see him-selfe, rather to be reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by God, then by us: after this manner the inferiour may admonish his superiour, especially when there is no other way of redresse, and hee is to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten, yeelding himselfe tractable. <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is advised by his servant, who said, <hi>Father, if the Prophet had commaunded thee a great thing,</hi>

            <p>Contrarie to this sobrietie is <hi>Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> whereby for hope either of favour or gaine, men, and especially such as are of dignitie and place, are soothed up in their sinnes, and extolled above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, even to their faces.

               <hi>Vrbanitie</hi> is a grace of speech, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men in seemely manner use pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in talke for recreation, or for such delight as is joyned with profite to them selues and others. The Preacher saith, <hi>There is a time to laugh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccle. 3.4.</note> 
               <hi>and a time to weepe. When the Lorde brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine the captivitie of Sion, we were like them that dreame.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 126.1, 2.</note> 
               <hi>Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this mirth must be joyned with the feare of God, otherwise <hi>Salomon</hi> saith well. <hi>I have saide to laughter, thou art madde:</hi>

               <hi>and of joy, what is that thou doest</hi>? And Christ saith, <hi>Woe to you that now laugh,</hi>

               <hi>for yee shall weepe.</hi> Secondly with compassion, and sorow for Gods people in affliction and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. <hi>They drinke wine in bowles, and annoint themselves with chiefe oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>

               <hi>but no man is sorie for the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of Ioseph.</hi> Thirdly, it must be sparing and moderate. <hi>Paul</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth such as are <hi>lovers of pleasures,</hi>

               <hi>Moses</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended that <hi>he refused the pleasures of sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The usuall time of mirth is at meates.

And <hi>Ambrose</hi> thinketh that he did this to stoppe the mouthes of talkers, and to occupie their wits.</p>
            <p>Withall it must bee remembred to be a Christian dutie, even at the table to maintaine talke of religion,<note place="margin">Luke 11.37<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 14.1. &amp; 22.15.</note> and of duties of godlinesse, after the practise of our Saviour Christ: though many upon lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ground thinke otherwise. <hi>Tertullian</hi> recordeth of the Christians of his time that they used in their love feasts to talke togither,<note place="margin">Apol. ca. 39.</note> as considering with themselves that they had God him selfe as an eare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesse to them. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> of this point saith well.<note place="margin">Hom. 2. in 2.

               <hi>I would to God</hi> (saith he) <hi>that in tavernes, and feastes, and at bathes men woulde talke and dispute of Hell: for the remembring of Hell would
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7570:26"/>
hinder a man from falling to hell.</hi> And it was the manner of the Primative Church at Dinner and Supper to use the reading of the Scriptures. <hi>When ye come to the table</hi> (saith <hi>Augustine) heare that which is reade according to custome,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And this holy rejoycing at meates, is specially to be used with such as are god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. As <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, that hee <hi>vvhich eateth at the covetous mans table,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 23.8.</note> 
               <hi>shall vomite his morsels, and shall loose his sweete wordes.</hi> The faithfull at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> did breake bread <hi>togither,</hi>

               <hi>with gladnesse and singlenesse of heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether jesting be tollerable in any sort, or not?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That jesting which standeth in quippes, tauntes, and girdes, which serveth onely for the offence of some, with the delight of others, is not tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.25.</note> because <hi>all speech must edifie, and minister grace to the hearers</hi>: neither
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7570:26"/>
doeth it agree with Christian gravitie and modestie. But two kindes of je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting are tollerable: the one is mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and sparing mirth, in the use of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> things indifferent, in season conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> without the least scandall of any <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> man, and with profite to the hearers.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The second is that which the Prophets used, when they jested against wicked persons, yet so, as withall they sharpely reprooved their sinnes.<note place="margin">1. Kin. 18.27. 2. Kin. 2.23. Isa. 14.11.</note> 
               <hi>At noone Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah mocked them, and saide, Crie alowd, for he is a god: either he talketh or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth his enemies, or is in his journey, or it may be he sleepeth, and must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for laughter, it may be used: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise God woulde never have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that power and facultie into man: but the use of it must be both mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and seldome, as sorrowe for our sinnes is to be plentifull and often.<note place="margin">Luke 19. Iohn 11. Hebr. 5.7.</note> This we may learne in Christ his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, of whome wee reade that hee wept three times at the destruction of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, at the raising of Lazarus, and in
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7570:27"/>
his agonie: but wee neuer read that hee laughed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fidelitie</hi> is constancie in all our law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sayings and promises.</p>
            <p>A promise is to be made with this condition (If God will) and then if a man be prevented by death,<note place="margin">Iames 1.15. 1. Chr. 13.2.</note> or by any like meanes, hee is not to be blamed: otherwise a mans lawfull worde and promise bindeth him according to the will and pleasure of him to whome it is made.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.17, 23.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nowe if afterwarde it be hurtfull to him that made it, he may crave to be free from his promise: and libertie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing graunted,<note place="margin">Psalm. 15.4.</note> take it. But a promise bound with an oth is to be kept, though private hinderances follow: yet so as the Magistrate may order the matter, and proceed in equitie, that the dammage may be the lesse.</p>
            <p>The last grace which is to be used in speech, is care of our neighbours good name,<note place="margin">Prov. 22.</note> which is farre <hi>better to him then great riches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is condemned the tale-bearer,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7570:27"/>
which of an euill mind telleth a thing of another, to bring him into hatred, or to reuenge himselfe, or to get something, which otherwise he could not obtaine.</p>
            <p>This talebearing is of divers sortes. One is,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.30.</note> when men whisper abroade se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly the fault of another, whereas they shoulde rather admonish the partie, as <hi>Cham</hi> when he had seene his fathers na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,<note place="margin">Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 9.</note> ranne straight and tolde his breethren. The second, when they adde to or change the thing said or done, as it serveth for their purpose. Some of the witnesses which came against Christ, charged him to say, <hi>I will destroy this Temple which is made with hands, and in three dayes builde another without handes.</hi> Where first they chaunge his meaning; for Christ spake of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his bodie. Secondly, they adde to the wordes. For Christ saide not, <hi>I will destroy this temple</hi>: but,<note place="margin">Matt. 26.60, 61·</note> 
               <hi>destroy yee this temple.</hi> Therefore the Holy Ghost noteth them with the name of <hi>false wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse bearers.</hi> The thirde, when men surmise, and tell that which was never
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7570:28"/>
done. When <hi>Ieremie</hi> was going out of Ierusalem to the lande of <hi>Benjamin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iere. 37.13.</note> and was in the gate of <hi>Benjamin, Irijah</hi> tooke him, and saide, Thou fleest to the <hi>Chaldeans.</hi> Then saide <hi>Ieremie,</hi> that is false, I flee not to the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> but hee would not heare him. The fourth is the coloured tale-bearing, when one speaketh evill of another, with fine prefaces and preambles, feigning that he is very sory that his neighbour hath done such or such a thing: that he speaketh it not of malice, but of a good minde: that hee is constrained to speake: that he speaketh not all he could speake: that the partie to whome the tale is tolde must keepe it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.<note place="margin">Vpon Psal. 15.3.</note> 
               <hi>Luther</hi> writeth of this fault very well. <hi>This vice</hi> (saith he) <hi>whereby wee tell abroad the things which we heare of others, and take them in worse parte, is very rife, and of great force to sowe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes: the rather because it often shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it selfe under the pretence and name of counsell and good advise. And it is a notable visard for a talebearer, to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme him selfe into an angell of light,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:7570:28"/>
and under zeale for Gods glorie to back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite anll accuse his neighbour of heresie, errour, and wicked life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore the Prophets meaning is, that we should conceale the evils that be in our neighbour, and not speake them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though he be an enemie and deserve it at our handes, and onely speake of those good things in him, which seeme to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve concord: for this we would that men shoulde doe unto us. Yea, and let us take heede that we judge not or condemne any mans saying or doing rashly.</hi>

                  <hi>Confes. lib.</hi> 9.</note> 
               <hi>Augustine</hi> saieth, <hi>that this was the care which his mother had towards her enemies. To doe this is a notable point of just dealing, but indeed there is no man utterly without this fault in this life: such is our wretched state in this worlde. For though some are of this minde, that they desire not to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens wants tolde them, and will not take all in worse part, yet if they be told and taken in worse parte of others, they can willingly heare them, neither will they checke the teller, but suffer bad
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7570:29"/>
surmises to take place with them. But</hi> Gedaliah <hi>the sonne of</hi> Ahicham <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the contrarie vertue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 40.</note> 
               <hi>who chose rather to hazard his life, then to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect evill by Ismaell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This tale-bearing is the common table talke in England: and it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull to see, how those, who are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise godly, are overtaken with it: but men must learne to stande more in awe of Gods commaundement, and also to consider that the same thing a man speaketh of another, commeth home againe by his owne dore. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when men shall enter any evill communication of others, we are to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt it by other talke, as not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it.</p>
            <p>Here remember that when gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Magistrates shall use harde wordes, not in the way of defamation, but for the reprooving of a vice, it is not to slaunder:<note place="margin">Gal. 3. mat. 3.</note> as, <hi>O foolish Galathians: O generation of vipers.</hi> And Christ tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <hi>Herod, Foxe.</hi>

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7570:30"/>
are to be added. If one shall say, <hi>It is so,</hi> and afterwards it proove otherwise, hee receiveth discredite, because he spake an untrueth. But if he shall say, <hi>I thinke it is so,</hi> though it fall out otherwise, yet he saveth his credite, because he deceiveth not, but onely is deceivrd.</p>
            <p>An asseveration is, when one doeth vehemently affirme or deny any thing. This is not to be used at euery worde: but then onely when a trueth of greater importance is to be confirmed.

            </p>
            <p>The thirde is an othe, which must

not be made by any thing in heaven or earth, but onely by the Name of God alone.</p>
            <p>It must be used as the last refuge and remedie of all. For when any trueth of great importance is to be confirmed, and all signes, evidences, proofes, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, faile among men on earth: then wee may lawfully fetch the Lorde as a witnesse from heauen, who is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of all trueth.</p>
            <p>And in this case an othe may be taken: either publikely before a Magistrate, or privately among private persons, if it be done with reverence and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:<note place="margin">Gene. 31.53.</note> as it was betweene <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Laban.</hi>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ise and godly silence is as excellent a vertue as holy speech: for hee knoweth not howe to speake, which knoweth not howe to holde his tongue. The rule of our silence must be the lawe of God. By meanes of which, wise consideration must be had, whether the thing which we haue in mind be for Gods glory and our neighbours good: which done, wee are answearably to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7570:33"/>
speake to be silent.</p>
            <p>Here must be considered the things of which silence must be used, and the persons before whome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The things are many. First, if any trueth be to the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of Gods glorie, or of the good of our neighbour, it must be concealed.</p>
            <p>The concealing of the trueth, is either in whole or in parte. In whole, when the speaking of the least worde is hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:<note place="margin">

In dayes of persecution holy Martyrs haue chosen rather to suffer death then to reueale their brethren, that haue bene of their priuate assemblies with them.</p>
            <p>The concealing of a thing in part is, when a man speakes a little of the trueth, and concealeth the rest. Which is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted in all good and lawfull procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, which manifestly tend to the glorie
