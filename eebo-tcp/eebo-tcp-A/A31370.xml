            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe <hi>The Raiſing of Water heigher then the Spring</hi> (after the way principally inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this work) ſeems to be oppoſite to the common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Opinion of all times, I have thought it not only ſufficient to teach the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Engin proper thereto, but alſo (for more ample ſatisfaction) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe certain Propoſitions to precede, in place of Principles; onely to make you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Effect of that Motion, by the Cauſe thereof; that ſo the way may be more acceſſible to the other <hi>Phneumatike</hi> Inventions; <hi>viz. [Engins moving by the force of</hi> Air.] To come to which, it muſt firſt be conſidered that all the <hi>Elements</hi> whether ſimple or mixt, have two principal moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>viz. Natural</hi> and <hi>Accidental.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Natural motion</hi> is that whereby each <hi>Element</hi> ſearcheth and draweth it ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place aſſigned thereto by the Divine Providence in the Creation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Accidental motion</hi> is that which is moved by any outward Force, different from the Firſt: Now although divers things ſeem to move contrary to their order,
<pb facs="tcp:98194:3"/>
without any <hi>external</hi> agitation: yet the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, that their contrary motion is cauſed, to hinder ſome other greater Accident. As for example, It shall be shewn that the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to shun Vacuity, mounteth contar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the ordinary Courſe thereof; becauſe Vacuity is more repugnant to Nature then the contrary motion of that <hi>Element:</hi> as shallbe ſeen by the principle Propoſitions, which ſerve as a foundation of this Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which are founded upon this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Nature, <hi>That there can be no Vacuity in the Elementary Sphear,</hi> whereof the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> do ſupply the inferiour part, and the <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Air</hi> (which incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs them) the ſuperiour part; and each of them are ſaid <hi>To be heavy or light, according as naturally they are near or further from the Center;</hi> But in theſe four it will be neceſſary to have a regard as well to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain things whereof the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> are capable, as to thoſe wherein they cannot ſuffer Accident: as the <hi>Water</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may be extended by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of <hi>Air,</hi> or atenuated and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>Air</hi> by the means of Heat, which reſolves it; yet nevertheleſs it cannot be preſt, that is to ſay, that a certain quantity
<pb facs="tcp:98194:3"/>
of <hi>Water</hi> cannot be forced by compreſſion to be contained in leſs ſpace then its <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> extenſion: and the <hi>Air</hi> on the contrary may be reſtrained and put up, being preſt; or rarified and extended, being moved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the other accidents whereof it is capable. Theſe things shall hereafter be Demonſtrated by Propoſitions founded upon <hi>Experience;</hi> which I have thought to be more convenient for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then to involve the Reader in a Labi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of <hi>Geometrical</hi> Propoſitions; which (although moſt exact) yet are not altogether pertinent for Inſtructions in this Subject. As for example, If we should build upon this Rule of <hi>Archimedes, That the Superficies of the Water is Spherical (when it is not moved)</hi> which Superficies hath for its Center that of the whole Earth; there will follow a Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that we muſt hold in the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; <hi>viz.</hi> That the Superficies of the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is Circular, which (in the like caſe as is that whereof we ſpeak) is eſteemed plain of every one; and that, Firſt, Becauſe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is undeſcernable: and Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot make a defect in any Oppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whatſoever; (a liberty therefore which is not permitted in the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>)
<pb facs="tcp:98194:4"/>
That therefore, with other reaſons have moved me to omit thoſe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations which ſeem to me to be too punctual for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Note alſo that when I ſpeak of <hi>Water,</hi> I mean <hi>Water</hi> equally heavy, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any difference, although in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity there muſt be had a regard thereto; cheifly if the difference be ſuch as in the <hi>Waters</hi> of certain Rivers whereof <hi>Plinie</hi> ſpeaketh, wherein nothing will ſink to the bottom; as in the <hi>Water</hi> of the Lake <hi>Alphaltite,</hi> and in the <hi>Water</hi> of <hi>Arethuſe</hi> which runs towards <hi>Siracuſe,</hi> and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their extream weight, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns heavy things to the top, as <hi>Quick Silver</hi> doth the Mettal, which ſink not in it (although it be liquid) becauſe it is more weighty. And in this we muſt make a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that Mettals and heavy Solids ſink in <hi>Water</hi> according to the figure they have: For <hi>Copper, Silver,</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> ſinks not in ordinary <hi>Water,</hi> if it be beaten out in plates or thin leaves: but if it be contracted into a more ſollid form it ſinks forthwith to the bottom. But theſe and the like things I shall treat of in a Commentary upon the books of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> concerning <hi>Weights,</hi> and <hi>Things ſinking in Water.</hi>

               <p>To give an example whereof, let there be two veſſels A and B, of one form, matter, and bigneſſe, the which let be full of Water; it is moſt certain that in either of thoſe veſſells the Water cannot be preſt, ſo as the one of thoſe veſſells may containe the leaſt part that may be more then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but when they are only full of <hi>Aire,</hi> I ſay that the ſaid <hi>Aire</hi> may be preſt, and one of thoſe veſſells may containe more then the other: which ſhalbe thus Demonſtrated. Let the ſaid veſſells A and B be made very cloſe on all parts, and at the bottom of the veſſell B let there be a ſmall hole E, to which the pipe ED is faſtened, the other end thereof D is faſtened to the upper part of the veſſell C, the which is alſo made very cloſe one every ſide, and containing about a third part of the veſſell B, and to make the Water enter therein with force, it will be neceſſary to faſten the pipe F neer to the bottom of the veſſell C, the which ſhall be made as high as may be, that it may give ſo much the more violence to the Water, the which entring the ſmall veſſell C, ſhall make the <hi>Aire</hi> that is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to aſcend into the veſſell B, the which ſhall containe more <hi>Aire</hi> then A by the quantity which was in C, and ſo the <hi>Aire</hi> ſhall be preſt in the ſaid veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell B; the which may be ſeen if you make a ſmall hole in the ſaid veſſell, by the which the ſaid <hi>Aire</hi> ſhall come forth with violence. But if you
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98194:5"/>
pierce the veſſell A there will not bee the ſame effect, becauſe in it the <hi>Aire</hi> is not preſt. But it is here to be Obſerved, that although the <hi>Aire</hi> may be preſt, it is but only to a certain degree, which is about a third part: and for proof thereof, If the veſſell C were as great as B, it were impoſible that the ſaid veſſell ſhould be filled with water, but that the <hi>Aire</hi> ſhall often break forth, and that becauſe B is not capable to contain ſo much <hi>Aire:</hi> therefore let it be held that the <hi>Aire</hi> may be preſt in a cloſe veſſell to a certain degree. There is another way to force the water with violence into the ſmall veſſell, by the means of a Seringe, as in the ſecond Figure.</p>

But it is to be noted in this Rule, that if the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be forced into the veſſell A with violence, it may be filled to a third part or thereabouts, and the ſaid violence is cauſed if the pipe X be made very long, or if you force the water in with a Seringe, as hath been ſaid; and as may be ſeen in the ſecond figure.</p>

               <p>There may be alſo made another Veſſel as F, which may be ſo hanged upon the handle as it may be moveable upon two Pins, and may over-turn and emptie the water when it is full. And to perform this, the Pins muſt not be diametrically oppoſite, but more towards one ſide then towards the other; Now becauſe the ſaid Veſſel being emptie ſhould return of it ſelf,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98194:10"/>
the counter-poiſe E muſt be put to the lighter ſide, to ballance it equally; this being done, if there be a weight (as hath been ſaid in the aforegoing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) which ſhall be heavier then F, that Veſſel F ſhall be at the higheſt when it is empty, but when it is half full being heavier then D, the ſaid Veſſel ſhall deſcend towards F, and being full it ſhall emptie it ſelf towards X: and being emptie it ſhall be again lighter then the Weight, and return to its firſt place; where it ſhall be till it be filled again to deſcend.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of the emptying may be gathered from the <hi>Corolarie</hi> of the 16. Propoſition.</p>
               <p>There may be alſo made another manner of Veſſel for the ſame uſe: as you may ſee in the Figure SZX.</p>

Now when A is empty and C full, the Veſſel Y ſhall be alſo made light by means of the ſmal Pipe Z, which empties the ſaid Veſſel about the ſame time as C is filled: then the ſame Veſſell Y aſcends again in its place, and P opens as it was before to fill the Pipes A. And ſo this Engin moves continually, by which the Water is raiſed higher then the Spring, of the height as is between the Pipes A, and the Pipes C.</p>

The firſt ſhall be by the currant of a River (as the Figure Shews) where there is a water Wheel, and at each end of the Axeltree of the ſaid Wheel is a handle of ſtrong Braſs, and forged to ſuſtain the force and weight of the ſaid Wheel: and if the ſaid Wheel be ten feet broad, and twelve feet in Diameter, the ſaid handle ſhall be at leaſt four inches ſquare, and ſhalbe rounded in the middle at the places marked with A, and there ſhalbe alſo two peeces of wood called Levers marked with the letters B and C, fitted to the arm of the ſaid handles, the one of which riſeth, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goeth down when the Wheel turns: and the ſaid Levers ſhalbe alſo fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to two arms or branches marked with D and E; the which raiſeth the Buckets and Suckers of the Pumps Alternately, and ſo the Water ſhall be raiſed to the Veſſel F; And from thence you may conduct it whither you pleaſe. As concerning the height which it ought to riſe; I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it muſt not be conſtrained to riſe more then thirty feet in height with one Pump; as ſhall be taught in the following Probleme: the great Pipe G, is the place where the Sucker lyes, which ſuſtains the Water when the Buckets or Suckers of the Pumps are not lifted up. The Figure with the ordinary practice which is had of Pumps, will make you eaſily underſtand this Engin. And if the currant of the River be ſtrong, and it is required to have ſtore of Water; you may make the Diameter within the Barrells ten or twelve inches, and the height eight or nine Foot: And to make it well, the Buckets ought to riſe and fall four foot; and when they are at their greateſt height that they may have four foot of Water above them, to the intent that the <hi>Air</hi> may not eſcape; for if the Water be not high enough between the top of the Barrel and the Bucket, the <hi>Air</hi> will paſs thorough the Water by bubbles, and make the Engin uſeleſs: and eſpecially when the Water is forced to riſe above fifteen or twenty foot. Therefore you muſt take heed that that accident do not happen. The proportion alſo of the Pipes MNO ſhall be about four inches in Diameter, if the aBrrels be twelve: if the ſaid Barrels be leſs, the ſaid Pipes ſhall be leſs in proportion.</p>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt let there be a ſtraight Axeltree of wood, a foot ſquare, and 60. foot high, marked with A, the which turns between two Pins, and above near the end, there is a Wheel of 24 Teeth, marked with B, the which turns a Lanthorn or Pinion of 12. Staves, marked with C, and a Wheel of eighteen Teeth, marked D. But there are but nine Teeth in the half of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, the other half is void; and there are alſo two other Wheels, marked with E and F, of equal bigneſs, and alſo nine Teeth on each Wheel; and let the toothed part of all the three Wheels be put above: then there muſt be a Pully put above marked with G, over which a Cord muſt paſs, the which muſt be faſtned by the two ends to the Axeltrees of the Wheels C and F, ſo as turning about one of the Wheels it may unturn the other: as you may ſee, and better conſider in the Figure of the <hi>Orthographie</hi> following. Then you muſt put the ſaid Wheels E and F, againſt D, ſo as D turning al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies the ſame way may make E turn half a turn, and then when it ſhall be in the laſt Tooth, the firſt of the Wheel F ſhall repreſent it ſelf againſt the Wheel D, becauſe the Wheel E ſhall make it turn back again, by means of the common Cord and Pully G: and after the ſaid Wheel D hath catcht the firſt Tooth of F, it ſhall continue to the ninth; and afterwards the firſt of the Wheel E ſhall repreſent it ſelf again. And ſo the two Wheels E and F ſhall turn forward and backward half a turn alternately: and to the Axel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree H and L there ſhall be faſtned two ſtrong Cords, which ſhall draw up the two Buckets which go into the Barrels M and N, and have about three feet play, riſing and falling; and they ſhall be made of Braſs, well fitted within the Barrels, and that they may deſcend of themſelves without being

Let then each of thoſe Wheels have nine Teeth in the half Circumference, and let that part of the Wheels that hath the Teeth in them be turned upwards, ſo as the firſt Tooth of the one meet with the Teeth of the Wheel D, when the laſt of the other hath paſſed beyond it: and there muſt be a Cord marked RS to go in a Pully marked T, the which ſhall be firmely faſtned to the two Axtrees, as may be ſeen in the Figure. So as if the Teeth of the Wheel E be entred, it ſhall make the Wheel F to turn half a turn by the Cord which is faſtned to the Axeltree of the ſaid Wheel, and ſhall preſent the firſt Tooth V when the laſt of the Wheel E marked with X ſhall be paſſed: and ſo the Wheel F making its half turn, ſhall make E to return as it was before; ſo as by means of theſe half turns (turning and returning) the Buckets of the Pumps ſhall be raiſed and depreſſed, as if it were with a turning handle: And the difference which is between the ſaid handle and this preſent Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, that the ſaid handle doth not raiſe the Bucket Perpendicularly, as this preſent Invention doth, the which is much better.

                  <p>THis Engin hath a great effect in Hot Places, as in <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italie,</hi> becauſe the Sun ſhines in thoſe places almoſt alwaies with great Heat; eſpecially in the Summer. The conſtruction whereof is thus. You muſt have four Veſſels of Copper well Soldered round about, each of which ſhall be about a foot ſquare, and eight or nine inches high; the ſaid Veſſels are marked with ABC and D: and there muſt be alſo a Pipe marked with E, put upon the ſaid Veſſels, to which Pipe there ſhall be Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered four branches, each branch being marked with the letter F, the ſaid branches ſhall be Soldered to the top of the Veſſels paſſing almoſt to the bottom of each Veſſel: Then there muſt be Soldered a Sucker marked with G to the middle of the Pipe, made and placed ſo that when the Water Springs out of the Veſſels it may open, and being gone forth it may ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: You muſt alſo have another Pipe at the bottom of the ſaid Veſſels marked with P, to which there is alſo four branches, the which ſhall be all Soldered againſt the bottoms of the ſaid Veſſels, and alſo a Sucker mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked H, to the end of which there is a Pipe which deſcends to the bottom of the Water, the which ſhall be in a Ceſtern or Veſſel marked with I: there ſhall be alſo to one of the Veſſels a hole or vent, marked with M. So pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Engin in a place where the Sun may ſhine upon it, powr Water into the Veſſels by the hole or vent M, the which Water ſhall be communicated to all the Veſſels by means of the Pipe P: and the ſaid Veſſels muſt have about a third part of their content in Water; and the <hi>Air</hi> which was in the place of the ſaid Veſſels ſhall paſs out by the paſſages 3, 4, 5, 6, afterwards you muſt ſtop all thoſe paſſages very cloſe, ſo as the <hi>Air</hi> may not come out of the ſaid Veſſels; and then the Sun ſhining upon the ſaid Engin ſhall make an expreſſion, becauſe of the heat (as hath been ſhewn in the foregoing Probleme) which cauſeth the Water to riſe from all the Veſſels to the Pipe E, and paſs forth by the Sucker G, and the Pipe N, and

               <p>TO demonſtrate Intirely the Engin of Plate 19. I will put here the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of one part of the Muſical Wheel as big as the natural, to the intent that you may perfectly ſee how the Pins put down the Keys of the <hi>Organ:</hi> the ſaid part doth onely repreſent ſix meaſures, the one of which ſhall be marked with Black or Gray all along the ſaid Wheel, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall be marked with White, to the intent that the diviſions may more eaſily be diſcerned, which ſhall be Parallel to the Keys: and if you will you may pierce the holes upon each diviſion to change the Pins, when you would change the tune: Then you ſhall put the ſaid Pins ſo as they may touch upon the Keys about the thickneſs of one of the ſaid Pins, and ſo as the one touch not harder then the other. Alwaies when you come to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-Crochets or Quavers, whereof there are ſixteen in one meaſure, it will be good that they do not touch ſo hard as the others, to the end that one Pin do not touch before the other have paſſed beyond the Key, which is to be obſerved in all the other meaſures, otherwiſe there will be a confuſed Muſick.</p>
               <p>As concerning the conſtruction of the Muſical Wheel, it is neceſſary that it be of Oak, very dry, and the peeces well Joyned and Glued together, to the intent that it do not ſwel neither on the one ſide nor on the other: As for the Pins they ſhall be of Braſs or of hard Wood.

               <p>LEt there be a Veſſel of Copper or Lead marked with A, very cloſe and Soldered on every ſide, and let it have a Syphon marked with C, which may be ſo made that the end which is within the Veſſel be near to the bottom, and that the height of the ſaid Pipe or Syphon be near the height of the ſaid Veſſel, then the other end ſhall come forth of the Veſſel to run into the Veſſel D.</p>
               <p>And to order it ſo as the Sun may not heat the Veſſel A till Noon, Behold how you are to proceede: Let there be a Tablet made to the ſaid Veſſel of ſtrong Lead or Copper, marked with B, (as if it were the Cover of the ſaid Veſſel half lifted up) well Soldered to the ſaid Veſſel, and let the ſaid Veſſel be Invironned with a ſmal Wall of Brick, ſo as there may be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98194:20"/>
onely the ſide before open to the Sun, and that the ſaid ſide be exactly placed toward the South. It is certain that this being well done, that the Sun ſhall not ſhine againſt the ſaid Veſſel, but juſt at Noon; and then the rays ſhine againſt the angle which the top of the Veſſel makes with the Table B, and by that means heats the top of the ſaid Veſſel, which ſhall make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in the Veſſel, ſo as the water ſhall run forth by the Pipe C. Let there alſo be made a great Veſſel marked with F, into which the water of the Spring which is to make the motion runs continually, and at the bottom of the ſaid Veſſel there is a Valve marked with G, at the lower end where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is a Pipe with a Cock marked with H, which ſerves to temper the courſe of the Water, which ſhall fall upon the water Wheel which is below.</p>
               <p>So when the Sun ſhall be directly <hi>South</hi> (as hath bin before ſaid) his rayes ſhall ſhine againſt the veſſel A, which ſhall cauſe a compreſſion of the water which is within, which ſhall run forth by the Pipe C into the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel D, which being half full ſhall deſcend and open the Valve G, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the water of the veſſel F ſhall run upon the water Wheel and make the Muſical Barrel to turn, as hath bin ſhewn before; and the Pins that are put upon the ſaid Barrel, ſhall touch the Keys M<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being put down ſhall open the Valves which are under the Summer X, and the wind that ſhall be in the ſaid Summer, ſhall make the Pipes of the <hi>Organs</hi> or <hi>Trumpets</hi> Sound which are above the Summer. Now Wind may be given to the ſaid summer after two ſeveral manners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is to ſay, by a Reſerve, which is filled with the water which falls upon the water Weel, or by Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows which are raiſed by another water Wheel, which ſhall move when the Veſſel D deſcends, and ſhall open alſo a Valve, as that is marked with G: but becauſe the Inſtrument muſt ſtop juſt at the point where it began, (when the Muſical Barrel hath made one turn) to the end that when it begins to Sound another time, the Muſick may be of a juſt meaſure.</p>
               <p>Behold how it is made to ſtop. You ſhall make a ſmal Veſſel of Copper marked with E, which ſhall have a ſmal hole in the bottom, and ſhall be ſo placed that the Cord which holds it ſhall be faſtned to a ring near the Valve G, and the water which ſhall fil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the ſaid Veſſel ſhall be conveighed by the Pipe marked with L, ſo as when the Valve G is opened forth-with the water ſhall run into the ſaid Veſſel, and when the water of the Veſſel F, ſhall be a little abated, then it ſhall run no more into the Veſſel E, which ſhall alwaies empty the water which is in it by the ſmal Hole at the bottom. And the time that the ſaid Veſſel E empties muſt be fitted to the time that the Wheel requires to make one turn, and the ſaid Veſſel being empty the Valve G ſhall fall down again, becauſe it ought to be made in a manner heavier then the two Veſſels E and D, when they are empty: and on the contrary, when one of the ſaid Veſſels is full, that they may be Heavier then the ſaid valve: And as concerning the veſſel D it is neceſſary that it empty rather then E, becauſe it need not keep ſo exact a meaſure as E. And ſee here how it empties, when it is half full with the Water which deſcends by the Pipe C, then it draws down it ſelf, and that marked with E, alſo becauſe it it Heavier then G, and at the ſame inſtant G opens, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſcends upon the Wheel and into the two veſſels, and when D is full
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98194:20"/>
then the Veſſel turns the top downwards and empties, and in the ſame time the water of the Veſſel F abates and is lower then the height of the Pipe D, the water ſhall run in no more, but the end of the Pipe L muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lower then that of D, to the end that the water may there run longer. It remains to ſhew how the Pipe A is filled again with water:</p>
               <p>Therefore let there be put a Pipe with a ſmal valve under the ſaid veſſel, after the ſame manner as in the foregoing Figure, and after that the Heat of the Sun hath made the compreſſion, and that one part of the water of the ſaid veſſel ſhall be run out after the Sun hath paſſed the ſaid veſſel, to ſhun vacuity it ſhall fill again by the ſaid valve as hath been taught in the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Probleme.</p>
               <p>In Sum, if all the parts of this motion be well ordered, you ſhall have the deſired Effect with admiration to the Hearers.</p>
