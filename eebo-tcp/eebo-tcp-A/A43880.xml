            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MEthod and Order are the chiefeſt Helps and Aſſiſtances of Memory. And therefore the enſuing ſheets being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bare and brief Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the moſt memorable and Important Paſſages which occurred in the two laſt Parliaments held at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>Oxford</hi> we have obſerv'd that method and connexion in the ſeries of Affairs, which is moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the Memory, by ſeparating the perfect from
<pb facs="tcp:59093:3"/>
the imperfect Matter, that the Reader may read, with more delight, the carriage of things, and make his own obſervations. To which end we have made no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Reflections of our own, to ſhew either favour or affection, partiality, or byaſſed humor; contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what might ſeem te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and cutting off the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities of a Diurnal way of writing. They that have not been ſo careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the looſe Sheets of the dayly <hi>Occurrencies,</hi> or have not had the opportunity to buy all the Narratives con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

So that we doubt not but the benefit of the deſign will far exceed the price of the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume. Some omiſſions there may be, but by thoſe that have view'd theſe Sheets, 'tis not believed, that there are any of any great Moment. Whatever they are, 'tis hoped the

Reader will pardon ſmall defects and judg charitably of the work it ſelf, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Variety, and the nicer nature of the ſeveral Subjects.

               <p>WHile the laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſate, I was ſo tir'd with carrying News to and fro, from the City to the Country; then back to the City again, day and night, night and day, that upon the Diſſolution of the Seſſion, I reſolved to retire altogether into the Country, to recruit my ſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the wearied Pinions of my Wings.</p>

               <p>So ſoon as they were met, a Meſſage was ſent from his Majeſty to the Houſe of Commons by Sir <hi>Edward Carteret,</hi> Uſher of the <hi>Black Rod,</hi> commanding

                  <hi>That the ſeveral Prorogations he had made had been advantageous to the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring States, and uſeful to Himſelf; as having employ'd that time in makng and perfecting an Alliance with the Crown of</hi> Spain, <hi>ſuitable to what he had before with the</hi> United Provinces.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That for prevention thereof, he gave them all Aſſurances that nothing ſhould be wanting on his part, to give them the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt Satisfaction their hearts could wiſh, for the ſecurity of the</hi> Proteſtant Religion, <hi>which he reſolved to maintain againſt all Conſpiracies of our Enemies; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur

with them in any propos'd Remedies, that might conſiſt with preſerving the Crown in its Due and Legal Courſe of Deſcent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To which purpoſe he recommended to them</hi> the ſpeedy Examination of the Plot, and that the Lords in the Tower might be brought to their ſpeedy Tryals.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then he laid before them the matter of</hi> Tangier, <hi>and the Expences he had been at to relieve and maintain that place; upon which he deſired their Advice and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But that which he valued above all the Treaſure in the World, was a perfect <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All Europe,</hi> he told them, <hi>had their Eyes upon that Aſſembly, ſo that a Miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of each other, would render the Friendſhip of</hi> England <hi>unſafe to truſt to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, he exhorted them to take care not to gratifie the publick Enemy, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage their Friends, by unſeaſonable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, which if they ſhould happen, the world would ſee, it was no fault of his, who had done what was poſſible for him to do, to keep them in peace while he liv'd, and to leave them ſo when he dy'd.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:59093:7"/>Concluding, <hi>that from their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and good affections, he could fear nothing of that kind; but that he rely'd upon them, that they would uſe their beſt endeavours to bring the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to a happy concluſion.</hi>

               <p>Having ſo done, he commanded the Commons to return to their Houſe, and make choice of their Speaker.</p>

               <p>So ſoon as the Commons were returned to their Houſe, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made, That <hi>William Williams</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> might be elected Speaker. Which was preſently reſolv'd, <hi>Nemine Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicente.</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> being thus cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, modeſtly at firſt excus'd himſelf, telling the Houſe,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he needed not to reckon up his Infirmities, which were better known to many of the Members than to himſelf. That as they had experience of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitneſs
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59093:7"/>
for their Service, ſo they had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Demonſtrations of the aptneſs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Members then preſent. That the Choice of a Speaker was the Effect of much time and conſideration, and that it would be no excuſe for them to ſay,</hi> They had not time for deliberation in ſo great a Matter; <hi>and therefore, ſince they had time, a more deliberate Election would be expected from them. That the ſecurity of the Proteſtant Religion; the ſafety of the King and Kingdom, and the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Juſtice of the Land, were the Grand Affairs in proſpect, enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with them to depart from their firſt Intentions of the Honour propos'd to him that day. Acknowledging himſelf to be ſufficiently honour'd with the propoſal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. For which reaſons he deſir'd them, not onely for his own ſake, but for their Honour, to proceed to the Election of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Perſon more proper for their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to leave him in that place where his Country had ſeated him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this excuſe being rejected by the Houſe, he was by two of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers conducted to the <hi>Chair,</hi> where being ſeated, he again ſpoke to this Effect,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:59093:8"/>
                  <hi>That he trembled to reflect, under what difficulties experienc'd, learned, and wiſe men had labour'd in that</hi> Chair.
<hi>Yet that he was not terrified with the Preſidents of thoſe</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi> who had impared their Eſtates and Healths therein; nor of thoſe who had loſt their lives in the Service, as being Sacrifices he owed his Country.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <hi>But when he conſider'd that ſome Gentlemen had maim'd their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in their Truſts, thoſe were the thoughts that wounded him moſt deeply, and would yet ſtrike deeper, did not they that call'd him thither ſtand by him, to ſupport him in all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He farther acknowledg'd that he held the place by their courteſie, and during their pleaſure, and that if he fell, he fell into the hands of Gentlemen, that made him what he was in their Service. Concluding,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he was theirs alone, and their own intirely, placed in their Service without ſeeking or recommendation; and that he expected no Boon, but by their Grace and Favour to depart as he came, when they ſhould pleaſe to command him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ceremony of the Election be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus over, the Houſe was inform'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59093:8"/>
that his Majeſty had, appointed the next day at three a Clock, for the Members to preſent their Speaker, which made them adjourn till the next day in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>The day following being the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Second of <hi>October,</hi> the Houſe met again in the Afternoon, at what time a Meſſage was deliver'd them by the Uſher of the <hi>Black Rod,</hi> commanding them to attend his Majeſty in the Houſe of Peers.</p>
               <p>Thereupon the Houſe attended ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, and humbly preſented their Speaker to his Majeſty, who preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made claim, according to Cuſtom, in the Name of the Commons of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in Parliament aſſembled, of the ancient Rights of the Commons, for them and their Servants, in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Eſtates, to be free from Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and other diſturbances; to have freedom and liberty of Speech in all their Debates, and to have acceſs to his Majeſties Perſon, as occaſion ſhould require. All which was allowed by the King.</p>
               <p>Being return'd to the Houſe, the Speaker took the <hi>Chair,</hi> and having

               <p>No more then what I tell you; for it was neceſſary that theſe matters of Form and Ceremony ſhould be firſt diſpatch'd.

               <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> then, being the twenty fifth of <hi>October,</hi> both Houſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met again, the firſt thing that found the <hi>Commons</hi> work, was a Meſſage from the Peers by the Lord <hi>C.

               </p>
               <p>The Addreſs, which was deliver'd to his Majeſty by the Lords attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59093:9"/>
him with their White Staves, was to this Effect, <hi>That whereas there had been a diſcovery made of a horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy by the Papiſts againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Perſon and Government, which ſtill continued, that his Majeſty would be Graciouſly pleaſed to iſſue out his Royal Proclamation, that all Perſons who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two Months after the date of the ſame, ſhould come in and give Evidence of any Treaſon or Conſpiracy againſt his Majeſties Perſon and Government, ſhould have a full Pardon for all ſuch Treaſons, Miſpriſions, and all Offences of Concealment, to the time limited by the ſaid Proclamation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which his Majeſties Anſwer was to this Effect. <hi>That having conſider'd of the ſaid Addreſs, and being willing to encourage the diſcovery of any Treaſons and Conſpiracies, as aforeſaid, he would iſſue forth his Proclamation accordingly, and pardon all ſuch Diſcoverers accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the deſires of the Addreſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tueſday</hi> 26. of <hi>October,</hi> the Commons fell upon the Regulation of Elections of Members to ſerve in Parliament, and appointed a Committee to draw up a Bill or Bills, as they ſhould ſee cauſe, for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59093:10"/>
that purpoſe, more eſpecially to take care to inſert a Clauſe, that an Action of the Caſe might be brought and maintain'd for Damages ſuſtain'd by undue Returns.</p>
               <p>Then taking into conſideration the Meſſage which had been ſent them the day before by the Lords, They alſo in concurrence with the Peers, voted an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to be made to his Majeſty on their part, to requeſt the ſame Pardons and Favour for limited Diſcoverers, as the Lords had already done. Which being done, Mr. <hi>Dangerfield</hi> (of whom I queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not but that you have had a ſufficient accompt already) was called to the Barr, there to deliver his knowledge concerning the Plot.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fame.</speaker>
               <p>That will be very neceſſary for my Pacquet.</p>

               <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
               <p>It will ſo; and therefore you ſhall have it as briefly as poſſibly I can ſum it up.</p>
               <p>He declared to the Houſe, That when Mrs. <hi>C.</hi> and <hi>He</hi> waited on the Lord <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terborough,</hi> to be introduced to his <hi>R. H.</hi> his Lordſhip ask'd him whether the Lady <hi>Powis</hi> had given him any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections how to diſcourſe the <hi>D.</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to know what they were. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59093:10"/>
he produced a little Book which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a ſcheme of the pretended diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry he had made of the <hi>Presbyterian Plot.</hi> Wherein his Lordſhip finding ſome O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, order'd him to Write from his own Mouth, that the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to riſe in the <hi>North,</hi> and joyn with the <hi>Scots</hi>; which done, his Lordſhip carry'd him with Mrs. <hi>C.</hi> into the Dukes Cloſet at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> where he delivered the ſaid Book to the Duke, who not only thank'd him for it, and his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the Catholick Cauſe, but wiſhed him ſucceſs in his Undertakings. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding withall, of what mighty conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the <hi>Presbyterian Plot</hi> was, if well manag'd; and that he queſtioned not but that the effects of it would anſwer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, eſpecially in the <hi>North,</hi> where he was aſſur'd of the Major Part of the Gentry.</p>
               <p>That after that his <hi>H.</hi> in the hearing of the Lord <hi>Peterborough</hi> order'd him and Mrs. <hi>C.</hi> to be careful what they communicated to ſuch as were to be Witneſſes in the Plot, for fear they ſhould be caught in the Subornation. That the <hi>D.</hi> alſo informed them, that in a Month or two Cmmiſſions would
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59093:11"/>
be ready as from the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> to which purpoſe he was order'd to find out truſty perſons that would be ready to accept them, which ſhould be deliver'd them by a perſon that ſhould be known by them to be no other then a <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> that they might be the more fit to ſwear in the Plot. That the <hi>D.</hi> alſo for their Encouragement to proceed in that ſham-Plott, promis'd them, that he would take care that Money ſhould not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bid them diſcover the ſame to the King with all expedition they could. That the <hi>D.</hi> made divers Vows and bitter Execrations to ſtand by them in the thing, and engag'd on his Honour to be their Rewarder.</p>
               <p>That being withdrawn from thence to the Lord <hi>Peterborough's</hi> Lodgings, they continu'd there till his Lordſhip had introduc'd Sir <hi>Robert Peyton</hi> to the Duke.</p>
               <p>That about four days after the ſaid Earl took the ſaid <hi>M. D.</hi> again to the <hi>D's.</hi> Lodgings at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> who then told him that he had gained by his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence a good reputation among the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, adding withall, that he ſhould in a ſhort time ſee the Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59093:11"/>
flouriſh in theſe Kingdoms, and Hereſie torn up by the Roots.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>D.</hi> gave him twenty Guinies, and ſaid, if he would be but vigorous in what he had undertaken already, he would ſo order it, that Mr. <hi>D's</hi> life ſhould not be in the leaſt danger, with ſeveral other Circumſtances relating to the ſaid Plot, too tedious to relate.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>'Tis well enough, ſo long as here is the main, and chief ſubſtance of the reſt.</p>

               <p>There is ſo; and we are not to make Enlargements, where we intend Epitome's.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Dangerfeild</hi> having made an end of his Relation withdrew. But the Houſe taking a more particular notice, that he had made mention of Sir <hi>Robert Peyton</hi> in his Information, preſently or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Committee to examine the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters touching Sir <hi>Robert Peyton,</hi> and to report the ſame, and came to a Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> to proceed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to ſuppreſs Popery, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a Popiſh Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>Upon the twenty ſeventh of <hi>October,</hi> the Addreſs of the Commons to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, in concurrence with the Lords,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59093:12"/>
for a Proclamation, to aſſure all ſuch Perſons their Pardons, as ſhould make their Diſcoveries within two Months after the date of the Proclamation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepar'd and finiſh'd by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitee, was read in the Houſe upon the Report of Mr. <hi>Treby</hi>; and ran much to this Effect,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We your Majeſties moſt Loyal Subjects, the Commons of</hi> England <hi>aſſembled, being highly zealous for the preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, your Majeſties Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Perſon and Government, and reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to purſue with a ſtrict and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial enquiry, the execrable Papiſt Plot, which was detected in the two laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and has been ſupported and carried on by potent and reſtleſs Practiſes and Machinations, eſpecially during the late Receſſes of Parliament, whereby ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons have been terrified and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd from declaring their knowledge thereof, moſt humbly beſeech your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, that for the ſecurity of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who ſhall be willing to give Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and make further ſatisfactory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery concerning the ſame to this Houſe, your Majeſty would be pleas'd to iſſue your Royal Proclamation, aſſuring all the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59093:12"/>
ſaid perſons of your Gracious Pardon, if they ſhall give ſuch Evidence or make ſuch Diſcovery, within two Months after the date of the Proclamation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With this Addreſs, the Speaker at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by ſeveral Members of the Houſe, waited upon his Majeſty the next day in the Afternoon. To which his Majeſty was pleas'd to return his Anſwer to this Effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he did intend to direct ſuch a Proclamation, and was reſolved not onely to proſecute the Plot but Popery alſo, and to take care of the Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſh'd by Law, adding, That if the Houſe did but go on Calmly in their Debates without heat, that he did not doubt, but to beat down Popery and all that belong'd to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return where we left off, ſo ſoon as the report of this <hi>Addreſs</hi> had been made; and that it had paſs'd Approbation, the Houſe fell the ſame day upon the buſineſs of Petitions, which they reſented ſo high, that they came to ſeveral Reſolves: Firſt, that it was the undoubted Right of the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> to Petition the King for the calling and ſitting of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59093:13"/>
and Redreſſing of Grievances.</p>
               <p>That to traduce ſuch Petitioning as a violation of Duty, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it to his Majeſty, as Tumultuous and Seditious, was to betray the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Subject, and contributed to the deſign of ſubverting the ancient Legal Conſtitutions of this Kingdom, and introducing Arbitrary Power.</p>
               <p>Which Reſolves paſſing <hi>Nemine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicente,</hi> they appointed a Committee to enquire of all ſuch Perſons as had offended againſt the Rights of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>Thereupon the Houſe being inform'd that Sir <hi>Francis Withens,</hi> one of the Members, had offended againſt the ſaid Right of the Subject, he was order'd to attend the next Morning.</p>
               <p>After which they paſs'd a Reſolve, to make an Addreſs to his Majeſty, with a declaration of their Reſolution to preſerve and ſupport the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Government, and the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
               <p>The next Morning, Sir <hi>Francis Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> appearing in his Place, according to the Order made the day before, the

               <p>Having thus done with Sir <hi>Francis</hi> for that time, they took Sir <hi>Robert Yeoman</hi>'s and Sir <hi>Robert Can,</hi> a Member of the Houſe, to task; for that they in <hi>October</hi> 1679, had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly declared that there was no Plot, but onely a <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Plot.</p>
               <p>The words were atteſted by Mr. <hi>Rowe</hi> the Sword-bearer of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Knight</hi> a Member of the Houſe alſo.</p>
               <p>To which Sir <hi>Robert Can</hi> being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon by the Houſe to make his defence, ſaid little for himſelf, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flung ſeveral reflecting and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59093:14"/>
expreſſions upon Sir <hi>Robert Can.</hi> For which as for an offence againſt good Manners, he was preſently or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to receive a Reprehenſion from the Speaker upon his knees. Nor was this all, for Sir <hi>Robert</hi> being now withdrawn, the Houſe proceeded to take the matters charg'd againſt him into farther Conſideration, and after ſome time of debate, reſolv'd, that it did appear by the Evidence given to the Houſe, that Sir <hi>Robert Can</hi> was guilty of the words before mention'd, and order'd him as a Member of the Houſe, to be expel'd the Houſe, and committed to the <hi>Tower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon he was preſently call'd to the Bar and received the Judgement of the Houſe upon his knees from the Mouth of the Speaker.</p>
               <p>As for Sir <hi>Robert Yeomans,</hi> he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Town, was order'd to be ſent for in cuſtody of the Serjeant attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Houſe.</p>
               <p>The next day being the twenty ninth of <hi>October,</hi> as they had been ſevere in puniſhing, ſo they they began to think of rewarding, and order'd that Dr. <hi>Tongue</hi> ſhould be humbly recommended by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59093:14"/>
the Houſe to his Majeſty, for the firſt conſiderable Church-preferment, that ſhould become void in the Kingdom, and that ſuch of the Members as were of the Privy Council, ſhould repreſent the ſame to his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the <hi>Addreſs</hi> for the preſervation and ſupport of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Perſon and Government, being prepar'd and finiſh'd, was read in the Houſe to this Effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they did with moſt thankful hearts acknowledge, not only his Majeſties ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny former Royal Declarations of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the Proteſtant Religion, but his farther Manifeſtation of the ſame, in his Gracious Speech to both Houſes, at the opening of the Parliament. And therefore as the Eyes of all the Proteſtants abroad were upon them, and that look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his Majeſty as the Royal Head of ſo many Proteſtant Countries, they could not but hope that his Majeſty would be the greateſt Protection to them, from whom the Kingdom has Reaſon to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a Mutual Aſſiſtance as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vovl'd in the ſame Danger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They did humbly aſſure his Majeſty, that they would be always ready to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59093:15"/>
his Majeſties Perſon and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to ſupport the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion both at home and abroad. Beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Majeſty to eſteem thoſe that ſhould otherwiſe repreſent them to his Majeſty, as ſuch who deſign'd to divide between the King and his People, and defeat the meeting of Parliaments, that the Popiſh deſigns might ſucceed. Which has been made Evident by the Contrivance of a wicked deſign, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Guilt of their own Crimes upon his Majeſties Loyal Proteſtant Nobility and Gentry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Addreſs being read and conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by the whole Houſe, they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the buſineſs of Sir <hi>Francis Withens,</hi> and to that purpoſe examin'd ſeveral Witneſſes at the Bar. At length it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing not onely by the Evidence, but by the Confeſſion of Sir <hi>Francis</hi> hmſelf, that he had preſented an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to his Majeſty, expreſſing an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency to Petition for the calling and ſitting of Parliaments, it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, That he had betray'd the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Rights of the Subjects of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>: And Sir <hi>Francis</hi> was order'd to be expell'd the Houſe, and received his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59093:15"/>
Sentence upon his knees accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday,</hi> the thirtieth of <hi>October,</hi> concluded the Parliamentary Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Month, and little occurr'd but that Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Houſe, that his Majeſty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attended by ſuch of the Members as were of the Privy Council, with the <hi>Addreſs</hi> relating to Dr. <hi>Tongue,</hi> was pleas'd to anſwer, That he had already taken care of him, and would alſo take him into his farther Conſideration.</p>
               <p>Then it was alſo that the Votes of the Houſe were firſt order'd to be Printed, being firſt perus'd and ſign'd by the Speaker, who had likewiſe Power to Nominate and appoint the Perſons that were to Print the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſame day alſo <hi>Franciſco de Feria</hi> deliver'd his Evidence at the Bar of the Houſe, concerning the Plot; the Effect whereof in ſhort was,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That being preferr'd to be Interpreter, and Secretary of Languages to the Lord</hi> Gaſpar Abrew de Freitas, <hi>Embaſſador in Ordinary for the Prince of</hi> Portugal <hi>to the King of</hi> England; <hi>That being in great Favour with the ſaid Embaſſador, he the ſaid Embaſſador did entruſt him
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59093:16"/>
with ſeveral of his Secrets; and that at the Tryal of the five Jeſuites, being then pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate with his Lord, the Embaſſador expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much ſorrow for the Oppreſſion of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and wiſh'd that</hi> Oates <hi>and</hi> Bedlow <hi>were made away; and then told him, that he might doe the Catholick cauſe great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and might make his own Fortune, if he would joyn in deſtroying</hi> Oates and Bedlow: <hi>That</hi> 50000 Reales d' Ocho <hi>ſhould be given for that piece of Service, and that two ſufficient Perſons ſhould be joyn'd with him to kill the ſaid</hi> Oates <hi>and</hi> Bedlow. <hi>That afterwards under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that</hi> Bedlow <hi>was not dead in</hi> Ireland, <hi>as had been reported, the ſaid Embaſſador renew'd his Sollicitations to him to kill</hi> Oates <hi>and</hi> Bedlow, <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to make good the ſaid ſum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to him, to pay his Debts and carry him into</hi> Portugal. <hi>That the ſaid Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador tempted him to kill the Earl of</hi> Shaftsbury, <hi>by throwing a hand-Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do into his Coach as he was travelling upon the Road into the Country.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That after the acquittal of Sir</hi> George, <hi>he was ſent to the ſaid Sir</hi> George <hi>to tell him from the Embaſſador, That his Fortune and Eſtate were all at his Service, and ſo was his Princes. That the Catholicks
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59093:16"/>
were all bound to pray for Sir</hi> Philip Floyd <hi>for his Generoſity.</hi> To which Sir <hi>George</hi> reply'd, <hi>That had it not been for him, he had not been ſav'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That after the Tryal was over, the Embaſſador went to viſit the Lord <hi>C. J. Schroggs</hi> in his Sedan with his Coach of State. That the Complement was in <hi>Portugueze,</hi> interpreted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to this Effect, <hi>My Lord, I am come to viſit you, as you are a Miniſter of State, and as I am ſent as Embaſſador from the Prince of</hi> Portugal <hi>to the King of</hi> England, <hi>and am likewiſe to thank you for the Juſtice you have done yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day to Sir</hi> George Wakeman. <hi>To which my Lord C. J. anſwered, I am plac'd to do Juſtice, and will not be curb'd by the Rabble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which Information, amongſt the reſt, was Printed as it was deliver'd more at large, by order of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>The ſame day alſo the Commons made new Reſolves, <hi>Nemine Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente,</hi> to proceed to the full Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Popiſh Plot, in order to the bringing of the Offenders to Juſtice. To which purpoſe they appointed a Committee to inſpect the Journalls of the two laſt Parliaments, and make
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59093:17"/>
their Report, and order'd an humble Addreſs to be made to his Majeſty, that all the Letters, Papers and Evidences, which had been delivered to the Privy Council, relating to the Popiſh Plot, might be delivered in to the Houſe.</p>
               <p>And thus ended <hi>October.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fame.</speaker>
               <p>By the way, what became of the Addreſs for the preſervation of his Majeſties Perſon and Government?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
               <p>Thou ſhalt hear. For though the Addreſs were made upon the <hi>Saturday</hi> before, according to his Majeſties ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, yet, the Houſe had no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of it in a Parliamentary way till the <hi>Munday</hi> following, which was the <hi>Firſt of November.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But firſt Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> made his Report concerning the Addreſs that had been orderd to be made for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery to the Houſe of all Papers, Letters and Evidences concerning the Plot, in the Cuſtody of the Privy Council; To which he gave an accompt in ſhort, That they were already delivered to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Lords appointed for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the ſaid Plot. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, Mr. Speaker acquainted the Houſe with his Majeſties Anſwer to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59093:17"/>
their Addreſs, declaring their Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to preſerve and ſupport his Perſon and Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was to this effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he thanked them heartily for their Zeal to the Proteſtant Religion, and aſſur'd them that there ſhould be nothing wanting both at home and abroad to preſerve it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Little was done the reſt of this day, nor much the beginning of the next, which was <hi>Tueſday</hi> the Second of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> till Mr. <hi>Treby</hi> having given a full Information to the Houſe of all matters by him reported in the laſt Parliament relating to the Popiſh Plot, the Houſe came to three moſt Remarkable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, of which two were carryed with a <hi>Nemine Contradicente.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt was, That the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>York's</hi> being a Papiſt, and his hopes of coming to the Crown, had given the greateſt countenance to the preſent deſigns and Conſpiracies againſt the King and the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That in defence of the Kings perſon and Government, and of the Proteſtant Religion, the Houſe did declare, That they would ſtand by his Majeſty with their Lives and Fortunes,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59093:18"/>
and that if his Majeſty ſhould come by any Violent death (which God forbid) they would revenge it to the utmoſt upon the Papiſts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That a Bill ſhould be brought in to diſenable the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>York</hi> to inherit the Imperial Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In order whereunto a Committee was appointed to ſit and prepare a Bill.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the third of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> little paſs'd of remark, only that the Lords by a Meſſage deſired their concurrence to an Act for the better Regulating of Peers in <hi>England</hi>; and that in the Houſe of Commons a Reſolve was made, <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> That a Bill ſhould be brought in for the better Uniting his Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Fourth of <hi>January</hi> was leſs remarkable for buſineſs then the day beforegoing; unleſs I ſhould trouble thee, <hi>Fame,</hi> to carry the relation of preparatory Votes, or the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of breaches of priviledges, or conteſts about Elections, which are nothing to the Generall Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fame.</speaker>
               <p>Thou art in the right, they are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59093:18"/>
not for my purpoſe, and therefore thou doſt well to leave it out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
               <p>However I muſt not omit to tell thee, that the Bill for diſabling <hi>James Duke</hi> of <hi>York</hi> to inherit the Imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Dominions thereunto belonging, was this day read the firſt time.</p>
               <p>The next day being the Fifth of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi> the Houſes were both adjourned till <hi>Saturday</hi> the Sixth of <hi>November</hi>; at what time the Houſe taking into their Conſideration the buſineſs of the diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proteſtants, came to a unanimous Reſolve, that it was The Opinion of the Houſe, that the Acts of Parliament made in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> ought not to be extended againſt Proteſtant Diſſenters. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they order'd a Bill to be brought in for repeal of all or any part of the Act of Parliament made in the Thirty fifth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Chapter the firſt, printed in the Statute-book of <hi>Pulton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This done, Mr. <hi>Jeniſon,</hi> being call'd in, gave his Information at the Bar, relating to the Popiſh Plot. At the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of which, he was orderd to put it in writing, and preſent it to the Houſe
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59093:19"/>
on the <hi>Munday</hi> following. The Sum of the Information was this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That about the beginning of the year</hi> 78. <hi>he had heard Mr.</hi> Ireland, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Tho. Jeniſon, <hi>both</hi> Jeſuits, <hi>diſcourſe of a deſigne by the</hi> Roman Catholiks, <hi>to obtain a Toleration for the open profeſſion of their Religion in</hi> England; <hi>which was to be done by collecting a good round Sum of Money among them, and bribing the Parliament. That they alſo diſcourſed of ſecuring the</hi> Duke <hi>of</hi> Yorks <hi>ſucceſſion, by granting out Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to thoſe of the Religion to riſe upon the death of the King. That he heard the ſaid</hi> Ireland <hi>ſay at another time, that there was only one in the way who hindred that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion from flouriſhing in</hi> England; <hi>and that it was an eaſie thing to poiſon the King by the means of Sir</hi> George Wakeman.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in</hi> Auguſt <hi>of the ſame year, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from</hi> Windſor, <hi>he went to Mr.</hi> Irelands <hi>Chamber, where he found him pulling off his boots, being as he ſaid newly come Poſt from</hi> Wolverhampton. <hi>That diſcourſing of the Kings paſtimes at</hi> Windſor, <hi>and particularly of his going a fiſhing with a ſmall retinue of two or three, the ſaid</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>made anſwer, that then he might be eaſily taken off. That the ſaid</hi> Ireland
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59093:19"/>
                  <hi>offered him to quit him of a debt if he would be aſſiſting to the taking off the King, urging how meritorious it would be, and how much to the glory of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That upon his refuſall, Mr.</hi> Ireland <hi>ask'd him if he knew any ſtout</hi> Iriſh <hi>Gentlemen? upon which he nam'd</hi> Lavallin, Karney, <hi>and</hi> Brahal, <hi>together with one</hi> Wilſon, <hi>an</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman. <hi>Of which Gentlemen the ſaid Mr.</hi> Ireland <hi>did approve as fit for the deſign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That at another time he heard Mr.</hi> Tho. Jeniſon <hi>ſay, that if</hi> C. R. <hi>would not be</hi> R. C. <hi>he ſhould not be long</hi> C. R. <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the King being excommunicate and depos'd, he was no longer King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having heard this Information, the Bill againſt the Dukes Inheritance was read a Second time, and two Reſolves made.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the Bill ſhould be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a Committee of the whole Houſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, which was done <hi>Nemine Contradicente,</hi> That the excluſion in the ſaid Bill ſhould not extend any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the Perſon of the Duke of <hi>York</hi> only. After which the Houſe adjourned till <hi>Munday</hi> the Eighth of <hi>November</hi>; the moſt remarkable paſſages of which day were, firſt a Conference with the Peers, manag'd by the Lord Privy Seal, at
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59093:20"/>
what time his Lordſhip did deliver to Mr. <hi>Hampden,</hi> and the reſt of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſeverall Examinations in writing relating to the Popiſh Plot, acquainting them farther, That all other Papers of the ſame Concern, in the Cuſtody of their Clerk, ſhould be delivered to the Clerk of the Houſe of Commons, upon his giving a Receipt for the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Second was the Releaſe of Sir <hi>Robert Can</hi> from his impriſonment, upon his petition and acknowledgement of his offence. And</p>
               <p>The third was the Reſolving of the whole Houſe into a Grand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, to proceed in the Bill of Excluſion, which was done ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that after ſeverall Clauſes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and Amendments made, the Bill was orderd to be engroſs'd.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fame.</speaker>
               <p>Was that Bill never to be ſeen?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, I have ſeen it my ſelf in ſeverall Coffee-Houſes. And therefore to ſave thy longing, I will here briefly recite the Heads of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Fame.</speaker>
               <p>That's as much as I deſire, for the reſt is but matter of Form.</p>

               <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>That whereas the</hi> D. <hi>of</hi> Y. <hi>was notoriouſly known to have been perverted
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59093:20"/>
from the Proteſtant to the Popiſh Religion, whereby not only great encouragement has been given to the Popiſh party to carry on a deviliſh Conſpiracy for the deſtruction of his Majeſties Perſon and Government, but that if the</hi> D. <hi>ſhould ſucceed to the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Crown of this Kingdom, nothing would be more manifeſt than a total Change of Religion: Be it therefore Enacted, That the ſaid</hi> I. D. <hi>of</hi> Y. <hi>be made for ever uncap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Inherit the Imperial Crown of the Kingdoms of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland &amp;c. <hi>And that if the ſaid</hi> D. <hi>of</hi> Y. <hi>ſhall at any time hereafter challenge or attempt to poſſeſs or enjoy, or take upon him to exerciſe any Authority or Iuriſdiction within the ſaid Kingdoms</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That he ſhall be deem'd Guilty of High Treaſon and ſuffer accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. And that all Perſans that ſhall aſſiſt him in ſuch Challenge or Attempt, or ſhall themſelves attempt or endeavour to put or bring him into the Poſſeſſion of the Regal Power, or by Preaching or Writing maintain that he hath any Right or Title to the ſame, ſhall be deem'd Guilty of High Treaſon, and ſuffer accordingly. And that the ſaid</hi> D. <hi>of</hi> York <hi>after the Fifth of</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 1680 <hi>ſhall not return into any of the Kingdoms aforeſaid; or if he doe, he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59093:21"/>
ſhall be adjudg'd Guilty of High Treaſon. That being ſo Guilty of the Treaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, neither the Duke or any other Perſon, ſhall be capable of the benefit of any Pardon otherwiſe then by Act of Parliament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in they ſhall be particularly nam'd.</hi>

               <p>The next day being <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the ninth of <hi>November,</hi> the King ſent a Meſſage to the Houſe in writing, by Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins,</hi> deſiring the Houſe, as well for the Satisfaction of his People as of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to expedite ſuch Matters as were depending before them, relating to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and the Plot, and to reſt aſſur'd, that all Remedies they ſhould tender to his Majeſty, conducing to thoſe ends, ſhould be very acceptable to him; Provided
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59093:21"/>
they were ſuch as might conſiſt with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Succeſſion of the Crown in its due and Legal Courſe of Deſcent.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Turberville</hi> being called in, gave in his Information, firſt by word of Mouth, and when he had done, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the ſame in writing.</p>
               <p>The effect whereof (in ſhort) was, <hi>That he living in the Family of the E. of</hi> Powis <hi>grew very intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with</hi> William Morgan, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſour to the ſaid Earl and his Family; being a Jeſuite, and Rector over all the Jeſuits in thoſe parts; and that he had often heard the ſaid</hi> Morgan <hi>tell the ſaid Earl, and his Lady, that the Kingdom was in a high Fever, and that nothing but bloodletting could reſtore it to health. That Father</hi> Cudworth, <hi>Guardian of the Fryers at</hi> Doway, <hi>had told him, that this King ſhould not laſt long. That in the year</hi> 1675 <hi>he was introduc'd into the acquaintance of the Lord Viſcount</hi> Stafford <hi>at</hi> Paris, <hi>to whom he had great freedom, and liberty of acceſs: Who at length, after many ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn promiſes of exacted ſecreſie, told him in direct Terms, That he might make himſelf and the Nation happy by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the Life of the King, who
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59093:22"/>
was a Heretick and a Rebel to God.</hi> Laſtly,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he was preſent at Maſs with the Lord</hi> Powis <hi>in</hi> Vere-Street, <hi>where the</hi> E. <hi>of</hi> Caſtlemaine <hi>ſaid Maſs in his Prieſtly habit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the tenth of <hi>November</hi> little paſt of Conſequence, more then that the Peers ſent down to the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for their Concurrence to an Act which they had paſſ'd for freeing the City of <hi>London</hi> and his Majeſties Court, and Parts adjacent, from Popiſh Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and providing againſt other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which might ariſe from Papiſts.</p>
               <p>Then taking into Conſideration the ſhort Meſſage ſent them the day before by his Majeſty, and delivered by Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins,</hi> they made two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That a Committee ſhould be appoynted to draw up an Addreſs to his Majeſty in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to his ſpeech</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in the ſecond place, That they would proceed in the Proſecution of the Lords in the Tower, and forthwith begin with the Lord Viſcount</hi> Stafford.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fame.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard ſay, that ſeveral Addreſſes were made to his Majeſty, for the Pardons and Maintenance of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59093:22"/>
Witneſſes that had given in their Informations.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis very certain; and 'twas no more than what you might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated almoſt upon ſuppoſition. So that it will be enough to ſay, for the effects ſhewed it to be real, That all the humble Addreſſes in that nature were anſwered. Beſides that it is our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to paſs over Things of leſſer moment as lightly as we can. And thus from the tenth we come to <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Eleventh of <hi>November,</hi> taken up for the moſt part with rectifying Elections, till Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Jones</hi> reporting, <hi>That the addreſs in anſwere to his Majeſties laſt Meſſage was ready,</hi> having read it in his place, delivered it to the Clerks Table; after which it was againe read by the whole Houſe, and agreed upon.</p>
               <p>Which being done, and the engroſs'd Bill of Excluſion this day read a third time; the Reſolution of the Houſe was, That the Bill ſhould Paſs, and that the Title ſhould be, <hi>An Act for ſecuring the Proteſtant Religion, by diſabling</hi> James <hi>D. of</hi> York <hi>to inherit the Imperiall Crowns of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Ireland <hi>and the Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging</hi>; and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59093:23"/>
the Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was order'd to carry it up to the Lords for their Concurrence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday</hi> the Twelfth of <hi>November</hi> ſome time was ſpent in reading the Engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Bill ſent up on the <hi>Wedneſday</hi> before from the Lords, for freeing the City and Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from Popiſh Inhabitants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of which, and of others no farther proceeded in, it is enough to ſpeak of their tranſmitment from one Houſe to another, as being ſuch as dy'd among the reſt in the Birth.</p>
               <p>After this, and ſome Amendments made of the Returns for the Burrough of <hi>Haſlemere</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bourk,</hi> Mr. <hi>Macnamarr,</hi> and <hi>Euſtace Comine,</hi> being ſeverally called in, gave their ſeveral Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts of ſome proceedings relating to the Popiſh Plot in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations I ſhall briefly recite the Heads in their Order.</p>
               <p>That of Mr. <hi>Bourk</hi> was briefly thus, <hi>That being by the Kindneſs of one Major</hi> Butler <hi>admitted to the knowledg of the Earl of</hi> Tyrone, <hi>and by that means frequently keeping his Lordſhip Company in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both at home and abroad, he obſerv'd that the ſaid Earl and the Major would be allway extrolling the</hi> French <hi>King, and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59093:23"/>
praying for his Proſperitie: That he farther obſerved a Continual reſort of Papiſts and Suſpitious Perſons to the ſaid Earls Houſe: That being one Morning private with his Lordſhip, his Lordſhip told him,</hi> That he had intelligence out of <hi>France,</hi> that the <hi>French</hi> were very Powerful, and that <hi>Parlez Francois,</hi> would be plentifully heard in <hi>Ireland</hi> ere long.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in farther diſcourſe, his Lordſhip drew out of his Pocket a great Quantitie of Papers rol'd up and delivered him to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe his name in one of them, and that upon a ſudden Glance he could read the names of ſome that he knew to be perſons ill affected to his Majeſty and his Government. That upon his refuſal to Subſcribe, his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip calld him Cowar'd, and drew his Sword half out of his Scabbard to have kill'd him, but was prevented by the unexpected coming in of another Gentleman. That from that time forward his Lordſhip us'd ſeveral means to Ruine him, and threw him into</hi> Waterford <hi>Gaol. From whence he wrote five Letters to the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of his hard <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage, and what he had to ſay as to the Conſpiracy; but could have no Anſwer. That being got out of</hi> Waterford-<hi>Gaol, he gave in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59093:24"/>
againſt the ſaid Earl at</hi> Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, <hi>where though his Lordſhip were bound over to anſwer the Informant at</hi> Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford-<hi>Aſſizes, yet ſuch was his power over the Judges and the Jury, that he eaſily got himſelf acquitted. So that finding</hi> Ireland <hi>then too hot for him, the Informant was forc'd to retire into</hi> England <hi>to make his Appeale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The heads of <hi>Macnamar's</hi> Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation were theſe, <hi>That one</hi> William Bradley <hi>
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a Juſtice of the Peace in the County of</hi> waterford, <hi>having firſt made him take an Oath of Secrecie, gave him to underſtand, that the Earle of</hi> Tyrone <hi>had received a Commiſſion from the</hi> French <hi>King to be a Colonel of Horſe, in the County of</hi> Waterford, <hi>and that the ſaid</hi> Bradley <hi>was to be his Lieutenant Col. and therefore deſir'd him to provide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of Horſe and Arms, and get as many as he could truſt, promiſing him a Captains Place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That after</hi> Bradley <hi>had unfolded to him the aforeſaid Treaſon, he met with the</hi> E. <hi>of</hi> Tyrone, <hi>who ask'd him privately, whether</hi> Bradley <hi>had ſaid any thing to him; who anſwering, he had; the</hi> E. <hi>bid him be very private, and then ſhewed him a Liſt of ſeveral that were to be Superiour
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59093:24"/>
Officers in ſeveral Counties of</hi> Ireland, <hi>which he took ſpecial notice of, as knowing ſeveral of the Perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the ſaid</hi> E. <hi>at the ſame time told him, that he had a Commiſſion from the</hi> French <hi>King under his Hand and Seal, to be a Col. of Horſe in the County of</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terford, <hi>and that there was hardly a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in</hi> Ireland, <hi>where Perſons were not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the</hi> French <hi>King for the ſame purpoſe, with other diſcourſe of the ſame Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Subſtance of <hi>Euſtace Comins</hi> Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was this, <hi>That living with one</hi> Keadagh Magher, <hi>his Relation, in</hi> Ka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigniſurie <hi>in the County of</hi> Tipperary, <hi>Treaſurer for the Confederates in</hi> Ireland, <hi>he was privy to the Payment of ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Sums to ſeveral Conſiderable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon the accompt of the Plot, by the directions of</hi> Plunket<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>titular Primate of</hi> Ireland, Bremand <hi>Titular Archbiſhop of</hi> Caſhel, <hi>and</hi> Powes <hi>Deane of</hi> Waterford; <hi>who had the diſpoſal of the ſaid Money.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That there was a meeting of the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Clergy with the Titular Primate, at</hi> John Walſhe's <hi>Houſe, who was Lawyer for the</hi> D. <hi>of</hi> Ormond <hi>in the County of</hi> Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perary, <hi>where they agreed to give every
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59093:25"/>
Judge that would goe the Circuite, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friend them upon Occaſion</hi> 200 <hi>l. a piece.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Sum of</hi> 200 <hi>l. was ſecur'd to Sir</hi> John Davis <hi>upon the ſame accompt, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then a Judge at</hi> Clonmel, <hi>of which he was an Eye Witneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, after the recital of many other Circumſtances, of his being purſu'd and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd by Sir</hi> John Davis, <hi>and ſeveral other Juſtices of the Peace, Contrary to their duty, for his diſcovery, he affirmed that the Papiſts had Barbarouſly Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd the ſaid</hi> Keadagh Magher <hi>their Treaſurer, when they found that he deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their deſign and was turned Proteſtant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Houſe having heard theſe Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, order'd that an Addreſs ſhould be made to his Majeſty for their ſeveral Pardons, and that his Majeſty would be pleas'd to take them into his care and protection.</p>
               <p>After this a Meſſage was ſent to the Lords, to acquaint them with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of the Houſe to proceed to the Tryal of the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and that they intended to begin with <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Viſcount Stafford,</hi> and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired their Lordſhips to appoint a day; as alſo that the Lords in the Tower
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59093:25"/>
might be confin'd, and kept from a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence one with another, as Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Impeached and Committed for high Treaſon ought to be.</p>
               <p>To which the Lords return'd for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>That as to that part of the Meſſage, relating to Confinement and Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, they had already given Order therein, as the Houſe had deſired; and for the latter, for appointing a day for the Tryal, they did appoint</hi> Tueſday <hi>come fortnight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thereupon they order'd a farther Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to be made to his Majeſty, That all Papers, Writings, Examinations, and Evidences, relating to the Popiſh Plot, which had been deliver'd to the Clerks of the Council or the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſince the diſſolution of the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſhould be tranſmitted to the Houſe; and order'd that Serjeant <hi>May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard.</hi> Mr. <hi>George Pelham,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Paul Foly</hi> ſhould be added to the Committee appointed to prepare Evidence againſt the Lords in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They likewiſe order'd, That another Addreſs ſhould be made to his Majeſty, That he would be pleaſed to give orders for Iſſuing out a Sum of Money to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59093:26"/>
the Charges of Summoning the Witneſſes, and other Expences incident to the proſecution of the ſaid Lords.</p>
               <p>And farther that Such Money as his Majeſty ſhould be pleas'd to direct to be ſet out for the uſe aforeſaid, ſhould be depoſited in the hands of Mr. <hi>Charles Clare.</hi>

               <p>All in good Time. For it was impoſſible for me to interrupt the Series of the foregoing Orders that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended one upon another. You muſt know then in ſhort, that this Bill as it was of great weight, ſo it occaſioned a long debate in the Houſe.

                  <hi>Saturday</hi> the Eleventh of <hi>November,</hi> Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> acquainted the Houſe, with his Majeſties Anſwere to ſeveral of their Late Addreſſes.</p>

                  <hi>Monday</hi> the Fifteenth of <hi>November,</hi> Mr. Secretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> deliver'd a ſhort Meſſage in writing from his Majeſty, Intimating <hi>That his Majeſty had at the opening of the Seſſions, in his ſpeech deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the advice and Aſſiſtance of his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in Relation to</hi> Tangeir. <hi>The Condition and importance of which place, oblidg'd him to put them againe in mind that he rely'd upon them for the ſupport of it: Without which it could not be much longer preſerved. And therefore earneſtly recommended</hi> Tangeir <hi>to the due and ſpeedy care and conſideration of the Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Meſſage being read and ſome other debates being over, Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> was call'd in, and gave his farther In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, relating to the Popiſh Plot in writing. The moſt conſiderable heads whereof were theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:59093:28"/>
                  <hi>That about the Twenty firſt of</hi> Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 1678. <hi>He being in Company with Mr.</hi> Ewers <hi>and one</hi> Hosbon, <hi>amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſe they both declar'd, That their deſign in carrying on the Plot, was to kill the</hi> D. <hi>of</hi> Monmouth <hi>as well as the King; which horrid Acts the Lord</hi> Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford <hi>at the ſame time propos'd for him to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in a Letter directed to Mr.</hi> Ewers, <hi>which he brake open and found to be the Lord</hi> Staffords <hi>hand, he read the following words,</hi> That things went well beyond the Seas for Carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Plot, and hop'd it did ſo here in England. <hi>And that for the pardoning of thoſe that were concern'd therein, Mr.</hi> Ewers <hi>told him, that there were ſeveral Indulgences, which he believed came from</hi> Ireland, <hi>to whom they were tranſmitted from</hi> Rome.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he very well remember'd that there was a meeting of the</hi> Jeſuites <hi>in</hi> April 1678. <hi>for that Mr.</hi> Ewers <hi>and other</hi> Jeſuits <hi>went out of</hi> Staffordſhire <hi>up to</hi> London, <hi>to be there at it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſeveral Sums of Money were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from ſeveral Gentlemen in the Countrey to carry on the deſign; and that he himſelf received</hi> 500 <hi>l. of Mr.</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſour

                  <hi>and Mr.</hi> Gawen <hi>at</hi> Wolver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton, <hi>which he return'd up to Mr.</hi> Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That at another time Mr.</hi> Ireland <hi>told him, that when he came to</hi> London, <hi>he would give him Inſtructions how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in his buſineſs; for that he could not well tell how the buſineſs went, till he had ſpoken with the Lords</hi> Bellaſis <hi>and</hi> Arundel <hi>af</hi> Warder, <hi>who would prove the Loyalleſt perſons for Truſt and Counſel in the world.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>That at another time, queſtioning Mr.</hi> Ewers <hi>what Perſons of Quality did coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the deſign? He made anſwer, Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral in ſeveral Places; and that the Lord</hi> Arundel <hi>of</hi> Warder <hi>was to undertake the moſt part of the deſign, and with the Lord</hi> Bellaſis <hi>to give orders both as to the taking the Kings life away, as alſo the</hi> D. <hi>of</hi> Monmouths, <hi>for the Eſtabliſhing the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Religion and Government in this Kingdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That rewards were agreed to be given to ſuch as ſhould deſerve them; and that the Informant was to have an Equal ſhare with one Capt.</hi> Aderly. <hi>Which rewards were to be diſtributed by the</hi> D. <hi>of</hi> York, <hi>the Lord</hi> Belaſis, <hi>and ſome other Perſons:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59093:29"/>
it being alledg'd by the Conſpirators, that there would be Lands enough of the Proteſtants to reward every one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he had intercepted ſeveral Letters from St.</hi> Omers <hi>and</hi> Paris <hi>to Mr.</hi> Ewers, <hi>wherein mention was made of ſeveral Sums of Money laid out for Arms, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly two Sums of</hi> 500 <hi>l. and</hi> 700 <hi>l. upon the accompt of the Popiſh Plot in</hi> England.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in</hi> September 1678. <hi>The Lord</hi> Stafford <hi>diſcourſing Mr.</hi> Ewers <hi>and the Informant in the great</hi> Parlour <hi>at</hi> Tixal, <hi>told them that the reaſon of his diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the King was, that he ſaw his favours rather diſpos'd to Rebels and Traytors, than to thoſe that had ſerv'd him; which was enough, if there were not the Conſideration of Religion, which was above all others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That at the General Meeting at</hi> Tixal <hi>in</hi> September <hi>aforeſaid, the Lord</hi> Stafford, <hi>Lord</hi> Aſton, <hi>and others, upon a full debate of all their preceding Tranſactions and Inſtructions for carrying on their deſign, reſolv'd to confirm the Oath's which they had ſeverally before taken, which was to kill the King, and Eſtabliſh the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Religion in this Kingdom. At what time the Lord</hi> Stafford <hi>engag'd to

make good his promiſes to the Informant both of Money and other neceſſaries for his encouragement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Sixteenth of <hi>November,</hi> nothing more was done, but only that the Bayliff of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> amended one of the Returns for that place, and put in Sir <hi>William Wallers</hi> name in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Sir <hi>Francis Withens:</hi> Which being done, the Houſe adjourn'd till the next day, being <hi>Wedneſday</hi> morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Seventeenth of <hi>November.</hi> At what time they took into Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on his Majeſties Meſſage relating to <hi>Tangier</hi>; and appointed a Committee to draw up an Addreſs, to repreſent to his Majeſty the dangerous Eſtate and Condition of the Kingdom, in Anſwer to the ſaid Meſſage.</p>
               <p>The ſame day alſo they order'd an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Addreſs to be made to his Majeſty for the Removal of <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax</hi> from his preſence and Councils for ever.</p>
               <p>The Subſtance of the Addreſs was as followes,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That being deeply ſenſible of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and miſchiefs occaſion'd to the Kingdom, by the diſſolution of the laſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59093:30"/>
Parliament, and the frequent Prorogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the preſent, and having juſt reaſon to believe that the ſaid diſſolution was promoted by the evil Counſel of the</hi> E. <hi>of</hi> Halifax. <hi>They did therefore moſt humbly pray his Majeſty, for the taking away all occaſions of miſtruſt betwen his Majeſty and them, and for their greater encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to perfect ſuch matters as lay before them for the preſervation of his Majeſties Perſon and Government, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, that he would be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly pleas'd to remove the ſaid Earl from his preſence and Councils for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which his Majeſty return'd for Anſwer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he did not find the Grounds in the Addreſs, to be ſufficient for him to remove the ſaid Earl. But he aſſur'd them, that whenever they ſhould in a Due and Regular Courſe prove any Crime either againſt him, or any other Perſon, he would leave both him and them to their own Legal defence, without interpoſing his mediation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Eighteenth of <hi>November,</hi> Mr. <hi>Treby</hi> was ſent to the Peers, to deſire their Lordſhips to communicate to the Commons ſuch Writings and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:59093:31"/>
which they had receiv'd from the Clerks of the Council; to which the Lords readily condeſcended accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their deſire.</p>
               <p>The next day being <hi>Friday</hi> the Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of the Month, <hi>Benjamin Harris,</hi> Bookſeller, then and ſtill a Priſoner in the Kings Bench, <hi>ad ſectam Regis,</hi> for a Fine of 500 l. for a Miſdemeanour by him Committed, having preſented a Petition to the Houſe, the ſame was read, and thereupon a Reſolve made, that Addreſs ſhould be preſented to the King to deſire him to Pardon the ſaid Fine.</p>
               <p>After which follow'd an Order, that a Commitee ſhould be appointed to draw up a Bill for the aſcertaining of Fines upon miſdemeanours.</p>
               <p>The ſame day <hi>Serjeant Rigby</hi> reported from the Committee appointed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after Obſtructors of Petitioning, that the Grand-Juries of <hi>Devon</hi> and <hi>Somerſet,</hi> were more eſpecially found to be tardy, and that Capt. <hi>William Caſtle</hi> being ſummon'd to attend the Committee, had contemptuouſly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected ſo to do.

               <p>The ſame day Mr. <hi>Zeal,</hi> being call'd to the Bar of the Houſe, delivered his Information at the Bar</p>
               <p>The Effect whereof in ſhort was this; <hi>That being a Priſoner in the</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalſea, <hi>Mrs.</hi> Celier <hi>came ſeveral times to him, and treated with him to be not only Inſtrumental himſelf, but to procure others to joyn with him to fire the Kings Ships as they lay in harbour; as alſo to ſwear againſt the Earl of</hi> Shaftesbury <hi>ſuch Articles of High Treaſon, as ſhe ſhould get ready prepar'd for him to that purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Information being heard, the Houſe order'd, that Application ſhould be made to his Majeſty for his Pardon, and ſome preſent Allowance.</p>
               <p>Other Applications were alſo order'd to be made to his Majeſty in the behalf of Mr. <hi>Hethrington,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for their Expences and preſent Support; as alſo in the behalf of Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> who had made a Conſiderable diſcovery of the Popiſh Plot, for ſome Ecleſiaſtical Preferment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:59093:32"/>To which and ſome other Addreſſes formerly made, his Majeſty, upon the meeting of the Houſe the next day, being <hi>Saturday</hi> the Twentieth of the Month, by Mr. <hi>Secretary Jenkins,</hi> return'd his diſtinct Anſwers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That as to the Addreſs in relation to Sir</hi> George Jefferies, <hi>He would Conſider of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That as for <hi>Lewis, He would Pardon him all Offences but Perjury, and that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſhould be had of a reaſonable Allowance for him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That as for the</hi> Iriſh <hi>Evidence, That in regard of their number, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of their Perſons not yet well known, he had referr'd it to the Lords Commiſſionours of the Treaſury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, <hi>that for Mr.</hi> Smith, <hi>he would take him into Conſideration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Houſe not ſatisfi'd with his Majeſties Exception in the Pardon of <hi>Lewis,</hi> reſolv'd upon another Addreſs, <hi>That all Pardons granted to any of the Perſons for whom Application had been made, ſhould extend to all Crimes and Miſdeameanours whatſoever, till the laſt of their reſpective diſcoveries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After which Mr. <hi>Trenchard</hi> reported
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59093:32"/>
from the Committee for Enquiring, after the Obſtructors of Petitioning, that Information had been given them, that Examinations had been taken upon Oath by Five Juſtices of the Peace in <hi>Monmouthſhire, viz.

               <p>The ſame day Mr. <hi>Treby</hi> acquainting the Houſe that he had made an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract in writing of ſeveral Letters and Papers relating to the Plot, it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,

               <p>There were ſeveral under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate and preparation: But becauſe they never came to perfection, I ſhall only content my ſelf to give you a Liſt of them at the latter end of the Book, which will be ſufficient to ſhew you what was really intended.

               <p>
                  <hi>Munday</hi> the Twenty ſecond of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which day the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Occurrences were his Majeſties An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to the Addreſſes of the Houſe, Firſt in behalf of Mr. <hi>Zeale, to which his Majeſty was pleas'd to Condeſcend, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference

               <p>To which his Majeſty return'd for Anſwer, <hi>That he would Pardon them for all Treaſons, Miſpriſions, Felonies and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries after Treaſon or Felony, and give order that a</hi> Noli proſequi <hi>ſhould be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd to ſtop all Proſecutions againſt them for all Crimes and Miſdemeanours what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. But that his Majeſty apprehended there might be ſome Inconveniency in grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pardons ſo general as was then deſir'd.

                  <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Twenty fifth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> nothing in the morning was done Conducing to the Series of this Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; only that the Underſheriff of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi> being complain'd againſt, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to be ſent for, to anſwer ſeveral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes and miſcarriages laid to his Charge.</p>
               <p>But in the Afternoon according to Appointment, the Houſe attended his Majeſty in the Banqueting Houſe with their Addreſs for a Publick Faſt, to this Effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That being deeply ſenſible of the ſad and Calamitous Condition of the Kingdom, occaſion'd by the Impious and Horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59093:35"/>
of the Popiſh Party; ſtill perſiſting in the ſame deteſtable Machinations, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many diſcoveries by Gods mercy and Providence brought to light, which impending judgment not being otherwiſe to be prevented but by Gods particular bleſſing upon his Majeſties Great Council the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they did in all Humility beſeech his Majeſty that a day might be ſolemnly ſet apart by his Royal Proclamation, to the end that by Faſting and Prayer the Goodneſs and Power of God might be implor'd to divert his Judgements and defeat the Wicked Counſels and devices of the Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which his Majeſties Anſwer was, <hi>That he would give order for a Day of Humiliation as was deſired.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday</hi> the Twenty eighth of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> his Majeſty return'd his Anſwer in the behalf of the <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters, That they ſhould be diſcharg'd, and that without Fees, as far as might be done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, and that they ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the Judges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame day the Houſe reſum'd the debate relating to the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mr. <hi>Seymour,</hi> and at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, <hi>That there was matter ſufficient in the Four Articles upon which to Impeach
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59093:36"/>
him.</hi> Whereupon an Impeachment was drawn up to this Effect,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That whereas the Sum of Five hundred Eighty four thouſand nine hundred ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eight Pounds two ſhillings two pence was rais'd by Act of Parliament for the ſpeedy building Thirty Ships of War, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by appropriated to that uſe; and whereas it was Provided by the ſaid Act, That the Treaſurer of the Navy ſhould keep the ſaid Money apart, and pay it forth to no other uſe or intent but only for the building and Rigging of the ſaid Thirty Ships. Yet that he contrary to the ſaid Act, and his duty did lend the ſum of</hi> 90000 <hi>l. Parcel of the ſaid Mony, at Eight</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, <hi>for the ſupport and continuance of an Army that then ought to have been disbanded by Act of Parliament, whereby two Acts were Eluded and the Army Continu'd, to the great hazard and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Peace and Safety of the Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That whereas the Pole-mony was rais'd by Act of Parliament to enable his Majeſty to enter into an Actual War againſt the French King, and only for that uſe, And whereas certain Eaſtland Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants did undertake to furniſh his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Stores upon aſſurance of Forty
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59093:36"/>
thouſand pounds, parcel of the ſaid Mony de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in the hands of the ſaid Mr.</hi> Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour <hi>as was by him acknowledged, yet that he the ſaid Mr.</hi> Seymour <hi>pay'd away the ſaid Forty thouſand pounds to the Victuallers of the Navy by way of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and for Proviſions not brought in. Whereas by the Proviſion of the Act, the ſaid Money ſhould have been paid to the ſaid Eaſt-land Merchants.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That norwithſtanding he had</hi> 3000 <hi>l. a year for attending the Office of Treaſurer, yet that out of the Money appointed for ſecret ſervice he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> 3000 <hi>l. a year more, which was duly paid him, as well during the Seſſions, as during the Intervals of Parliament; and particularly during the Prorogation of Fifteen Months.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That on or about the Eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of his Majeſties Reign, during the Dutch War, the ſaid Ed.</hi> Seymour <hi>being one of the Commiſſioners of Prize Goods did fraudulently and in deceit of his Maieſty unlade a certain prize Ship taken from the Dutch without any Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for ſo doing, and ſell the Goods, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending them to be only</hi> Muſcovado <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, And accompted with his Majeſty
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59093:37"/>
for ſuch, whereas in truth the Ship was laden with Cocheneel, and Indico, goods of great value.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday</hi> the Twenty ſeventh of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> nothing was done to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of this <hi>Compendium,</hi> only that whereas the Commons had ſent a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to the Peers, to deſire them to appoint a Committee to joyn with a Committee of theirs for adjuſting the Methods and Circumſtances relating to the Tryals of the Lords in the <hi>Tower</hi>; the Lords return'd their Anſwer this day, That they had appointed a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of their Members in Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Meſſage of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to which purpoſe they had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed five Lords to meet in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon in the Court of Wards. Where upon the Commons elected ten of their Members to meet the ſaid Lords accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the appointment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Monday, November</hi> 29. nothing was done remarkable to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>In the afternoon, according to appointment the Houſe attended his Majeſty in the Banquetting Houſe, where they preſented him with their Addreſs in Anſwer to his Meſſage
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:59093:37"/>
relating to Tangier, to this Effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That having taken into their ſerious conſideration his Majeſties late Meſſage relating to</hi> Tangier, <hi>could not but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt the preſent Condition of it, after ſo vaſt a Treaſure expended to make it uſeful, not only as one Infelicity more added to the afflicted State of the Nation, but as the reſult of thoſe Counſels which had brought his Majeſties Perſon and Kingdoms into thoſe imminent Dangers, which at preſent ſurrounded them, that they were the leſs ſurpriz'd to hear of the Exigence of</hi> Tangier, <hi>remembring that ſince it became a part of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Dominions, it had been ſeveral times commanded by Popiſh Governours, in particular a Lord impeached, and in the</hi> Tower <hi>for the Popiſh Plot, and that the ſupplies ſent thither conſiſted moſt of Popiſh Officers and Soldiers. And therefore as to his Majeſties recommendation of it to their Care, they did with all Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and reverence Anſwer, That though in due time they ſhould omit nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon them, for preſervation of every part of his Majeſties Dominions, yet when ſuch a ſtorm of Ruin and Confuſion threatn'd the Land, to come to any
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59093:38"/>
reſolutions in that matter, before they were ſecured from the dangers ariſing from the Power of Popiſh Perſons and Councils, they did not conceive would conſiſt either with their duty or their Truſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then they dilated upon the reſtleſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the Popiſh Party, the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous diſcovery of their deſigns, and their Continu'd influence at Court, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary proceedings of corrupted Juſtice in the intervals of Parliament, all which they repreſented at large to his Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>out of their Allegiance to his Majeſty, their Zeal to Religion, their faithfulneſs to their Country, they had upon mature deliberation propos'd one Remedy of thoſe great Evils, without which all others would prove vain and fruitleſs. So that if after all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Suggeſtions of the accomplices of the Popiſh Party ſhould yet prevail to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their faithful Endeavours, they ſhould have this remaining Comfort, to have freed themſelves from the Guilt of that blood and deſolation which is like to enſue. But yet that their only hope next under God was in his Majeſty, that by his great wiſdom and goodneſs they ſhould be ſecur'd from Popery and all the Evils
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59093:38"/>
attending it: and that none but Perſons of known Fidelity to his Majeſty, and ſincere affection to the Proteſtant Religion ſhould be put into any employment Civil or Military; that while they ſhould give a Supply to</hi> Tangier, <hi>they might be aſſur'd, they did not augment the ſtrength of the Popiſh adverſary nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the publick danger. Which deſires of theirs if his Majeſty would vouchſafe to grant, they would not only be ready to aſſiſt his Majeſty, in defence of</hi> Tangier, <hi>but do whatſoever elſe ſhould be in their power to enable his Majeſty to protect the Proteſtant Religion both at home and abroad, and to repel the attempts of his and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms Enemies.</hi>
               </p>

               <speaker>Fame.</speaker>
               <p>What was the Anſwer which his Majeſty was pleas'd to give to this Addreſs?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Truth.</speaker>
               <p>I find no mention of any in the accompt which the Commons gave of their own Tranſactions; which makes me forbear to inſert the Vulgar Reports,</p>
               <p>And now between the next day, which was the Thirtieth of <hi>November,</hi> and the Eighth of <hi>December,</hi> you muſt expect a vacancy of Parliamentary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, both Houſes being buſied in the Tryal of the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> from day
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59093:39"/>
to day till that time. For though the Houſe did ſit in the Afternoons, yet it was either to releaſe Priſoners, or hear Petitions, which are things altogether out of our Dioceſs.</p>
               <p>The Tryal began the Thirtieth of <hi>November</hi> 1680. and continu'd till the Seventeenth of <hi>December</hi> following.</p>
               <p>The firſt day, the Lord High Steward, <hi>Heneage</hi> Lord <hi>Finch,</hi> Lord High Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor of <hi>England,</hi> the Nobility, and the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> having taken their ſeveral and diſtinct places in Court, And the Priſoner being brought to the Bar, the Lord High Steward ſpake to him to this Effect,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Commons of</hi> England <hi>had impeached him of High Treaſon, for which he was then to he Try'd, that he was not try'd upon the Indictment found by the Grand-Jury, but proſecuted by the Loud complaints of the Commons, and to be try'd upon the preſentment of the Grand Inqueſt of the whole Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he was to be therefore Judg'd by the whole Body of the Houſe of Peers, where the ballance would be exactly kept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that therefore if his zeal had engag'd him in ſuch deep and black de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59093:39"/>
as he was charg'd with, he muſt expect to reap what he had ſown. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing him laſtly, to hear with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience what ſhould be ſaid againſt him,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Charge being then read, the ſubſtance of the Impeachment was,
<list>
                     <item>I. That there had been a Traiterous Plot and Conſpiracy both in <hi>England</hi> and other Places, to alter and ſubvert the Ancient Government, and true Religion eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Land. which Plot was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and contrived by Perſons of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Qualities and Degrees.</item>
                     <item>II. That for the accompliſhing of the ſaid wicked and traiterous deſign, he had agreed and conſpir'd with others to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, depoſe and murther the King and to Subject the Kingdom to the Pope, and his Government. To reſtore the Abbys, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo long agoe Suppreſſed, for their Idolatry and Superſtition: And by that means to deſtroy his Majeſty, Extirpate the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59093:40"/>
and overthrow the Rights and Properties of his Majeſties Subjects.</item>
                     <item>III. That he with the reſt of the Traytors had held ſeveral Meetings and Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, where it was contriv'd and deſign'd by what means, and what Inſtruments ſhould be us'd to murther his Majeſty. That it was there reſolv'd to Effect the ſame by Poiſoning, Shooting, Stabbing; and that at the ſame places rewards were offered to ſeveral Perſons to execute the ſame.</item>
                     <item>IV. That he with the reſt had Conſulted to raiſe Men, Money, Armes and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, and had Correſponded with the Pope, his Cardinals and Nuntio<hi>'s,</hi> and with other Forein Miniſters for the raiſing and obtaining of Men, Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the raiſing of War within the Kingdom and invading the ſame with Forein Forces.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="73" facs="tcp:59093:40"/>V. That he with the reſt had procured and delivered out ſeveral Inſtruments and Commiſſions, made and granted by the Pope and other unlawful Authorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for the raiſing and diſpoſing Men, Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and particularly for him the ſaid Lord Viſcount <hi>Stafford</hi> to be paymaſter of the Army.</item>
                     <item>VI. That to hinder the diſcovery af the ſaid Plot and to ſecure themſelves from Juſtice, He with the reſt had cauſed Oathes of Secreſie to be adminiſtred to the Confederates and the Prieſts to give them abſolutions for their encouragement aforeſaid to conceal the Conſpiracy.</item>
                     <item>VII. That he with the reſt had contriv'd to lay the Imputation of their crimes upon the Proteſtants aforeſaid.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>To this his Lordſhips Plea was,</hi> That he was not Guilty, and for his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59093:41"/>
Tryal put himſelf upon his Peers.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In the opening of this Impeachment Mr Serjeant <hi>Maynard</hi> beginning, told the Lords that the Charge was Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and Particular; General, the Subverſion of the Nation, Murther of the King, and ſuppreſſion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, which General was charg'd in Particular upon the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in regard that in a general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign as this was, wherein ſo many were concern'd, the Act of One is the Act of All, and the Act of All is the Act of every One.</p>
               <p>But his part being only to open the General Conſpiracy, he made out the Univerſal Hatred of the Papiſts againſt the Proteſtants, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Practcies of Murthers, Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Treaſons, in <hi>Spain, France, England</hi> and other parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and their Doctrine of the Legality of depoſing, and Killing Heretick Kings.</p>
               <p>Then bringing his Arguments home he called to mind the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Tampering with <hi>Bedlow</hi> to corrupt and leſſen his Teſtimony, and,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:59093:41"/>Their Charging <hi>Oates</hi> with Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Crimes by falſhood and Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to invalidate his Teſtimony.</p>
               <p>The particular Evidence was open'd by Sir <hi>Francis Winington.</hi> Shewing firſt,</p>
               <p>The extraordinary advantages the Papiſts had to enter upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy. The creeping of Papiſts at the bottom, and others that drove on their Intereſt into his Majeſties Councils.</p>
               <p>The eaſineſs of ſome Men to favour the Papiſts: new projects ſet on foot for a Reconciliation between the two Religions, by diſtinguſhing the Church from the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> Papiſts of Loyal and diſloyal Principles. Which gave them great Encouragement to ſee how freely the Pen was drawn in their favour.</p>
               <p>The Kings Commands of putting the Laws in Execution fruſtrated by the Publick Miniſters of their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the ſeverity of thoſe Laws turned upon the Proteſtant diſſenters.</p>
               <p>Laſtly their great hopes of a Popiſh Succeſſor.</p>
               <p>As for the proof of the Plot in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59093:42"/>
he Cited the Attainders of <hi>Coleman</hi> and <hi>Langhorn,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuites</hi>; The Attainders of Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury Godfrey's</hi> Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the Conviction of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinator of Mr. <hi>Arnold.</hi> And in ſhort the Convictions not only of Treaſons, and Murthers, but of almoſt all other Villianies whatſoever.</p>
               <p>To this he added, that proof would be made of the diſcourſes of the Preiſts and Jeſuits abroad, of the great alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that would be in <hi>England</hi> e're long. And that the King was a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick and might be deſtroyed, which Doctrine was diſperſed by the induſtry of ſeveral in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to particulars againſt the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he urg'd that proof would be made of his being at a Conſult at the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Houſe at <hi>Tyxal</hi> for the Killing the King.</p>
               <p>That he offered 500 l. out of his own purſe for carrying on the Plot, and particularly that part of Killing the King.</p>
               <p>That the Priſoner himſelf had tempted one of the Witneſſes to Kill the King, with ſeveral other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59093:42"/>
tending to that and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſign.</p>
               <p>Then Mr. <hi>Treby</hi> proceeded to call the witneſſes to ſhew the Univerſal Conſpiracy.</p>
               <p>The firſt was Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> whoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation had given him great Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of knowing the inſide of the Papiſts Affairs.</p>
               <p>He teſtified,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>That upon his firſt arrival in <hi>France</hi> he came acquainted with <hi>Abbot-Montague, Gaſcoyn,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Prieſts and Jeſuites who promis'd him preferment both among them and in <hi>England,</hi> if he would turn Catholick, for that they did not doubt but that the Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would come into <hi>England</hi> very ſoon, as not queſtioning a Toleration firſt, by which they ſhould bring it in without Noiſe: And <hi>Secondly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their party was very Strong in <hi>England,</hi> and in a few years would be able to bring it in right or wrong. That <hi>Cardinal Grimaldi,</hi> whom he met by Accident in <hi>Provence,</hi> told him, he had great Aſſurances the Popiſh Religion would prevail in <hi>England</hi>; and that there was but one
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59093:43"/>
that obſtructed it, who though a good natur'd Perſon, yet they could not ſo far prevaile upon him, but that they muſt be forc'd to take him out of the way.</p>
                  <p>That in <hi>Rome</hi> he ſaw <hi>Colemans</hi> Letters and read them once a Month, wherein he gave Intelligence of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Paſſages, that happened in the Court; how that the Duke, the Queen, and the cheif of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were of their ſide: How they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Matters, what waies the Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> and Sir <hi>William Godolphin</hi> uſed to effect the work; and that they did not Queſtion but to get the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Danby</hi> on their ſide. That coming into <hi>England,</hi> he found the Popiſh Clergy of <hi>England</hi> of the ſame Opinion, that they did not doubt the Romiſh Religion would ſoon come in.</p>
                  <p>That he knew nothing as to the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> but only that one <hi>Smith</hi> wrote a Letter up to the Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> out of the North, near where he lived, to complain of two or three Juſtices of the Peace that were active againſt Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Upon which Sir <hi>Henry Calver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59093:43"/>
was turned out of Commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>That upon the firſt Glimpſes of the diſcovery, the aforeſaid <hi>Smith,</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Priſoner whether he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make over his Eſtate or no?</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Priſoners Anſwer was<q>
                     <p>That ſeveral did, but he would not, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he expected a ſudden alteration of the Government and Religion.</p>

both Prieſts, to haſten betimes home to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for that the Proteſtant Religion was upon its laſt Legs.</p>
                     <p>That being ſent by the Jeſuites to <hi>Valladolid,</hi> he opened certain Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which the Jeſuites in <hi>England</hi> had given him to deliver to their Cor-reſpondents; which Letters did expreſs what hopes they had to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their deſign in <hi>England</hi> for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the Catholick cauſe, and for advancing the Intereſt of the Pope of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:59093:46"/>
In 1678. He obſerved by ſeveral Letters that they were as buſie in <hi>Ireland</hi> as in <hi>England,</hi> and that the <hi>Talbots</hi> and others were very buſie in raiſing Forces, and were reſolved to let in the <hi>French</hi> King, if the Parliament ſhould urge the King to break with <hi>France.</hi> And that <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> was ſent into <hi>Ireland</hi> as a Viſitor, to take an accompt of the readineſs of the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That in <hi>March,</hi> intelligence came to the Jeſuites of an Attempt that had been made upon the King, but that he had eſcaped, through the negligence of <hi>Pickering</hi> in fixing the Flint of his Fire-lock.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Dennis,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man being then ſworn, confirm'd Dr. <hi>Oats's</hi> being in <hi>Spain,</hi> and particularly at <hi>Vallado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,</hi> where he knew him a Student: That from thence he carried a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from him to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Tuam,</hi> who in diſcourſe told him that <hi>Oats</hi> would be a fit man for their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſaying farther, that <hi>Plunket,</hi> the Titular Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59093:46"/>
reſolv'd with the firſt convenience to go for <hi>Ireland,</hi> to carry over a <hi>French</hi> Power with him, to ſupport the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; and that he himſelf would not be long out of <hi>Ireland</hi> to aſſiſt in that pious work.</p>
                     <p>That he had both heard of and ſeen money gathered in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the ſupport of the Plot.</p>
                     <p>Then Mr. <hi>Jeniſon</hi> declared, that he had heard Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jeniſon,</hi> both Jeſuits ſpeak of a Deſign on foot to gain a Toleration, by procuring a great ſum of Money from their Party, and bribing the Parliament; and alſo of ſecuring the D. or <hi>York</hi>'s Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>
                     <p>That at another time he heard Mr. <hi>Ireland</hi> ſay, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion was like to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England</hi>; and that there was but one ſtood in the way; and that it was an eaſy thing to poyſon the King.</p>

                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:59093:47"/>
That at another time his Brother <hi>Jenniſon</hi> told him, that there was a deſign in <hi>England</hi> ſo laid, that it could not be eaſily diſcover'd, and that the greateſt Papiſts, and the greateſt Catholicks in <hi>England</hi> were in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
                     <p>That there was an Army to be rais'd, to bring in the Catholick Religion.</p>
                     <p>And that at another time, one Mr. <hi>Cuffil</hi> a Jeſuite declared, that he thought Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> infatuated, to give notice to <hi>Harcourt, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Fenwick,</hi> to burn their Papers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the diſcovery of the Plot, and not to burn his own.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Clerk of the Lords Comit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee delivered in the ſeveral Attainders and Judgments enter'd upon Records, upon the Conviction of <hi>Coleman, Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn,</hi> and the reſt. And upon the motion of Mr. <hi>Treby,</hi> the Attainder of Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> was openly read in Court; in regard there was more of ſpecial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in that, than in any of the reſt;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:59093:47"/>
more eſpecially among many other things; mentioning his proceeding, in Relation to the carrying on of the Plot, <hi>viz.</hi> his trayterous Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with <hi>La Cheſe,</hi> the King of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce's</hi> Confeſſor; and with Monſieur <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigni,</hi> the French King's Envoy in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for the bringing in of a Forrein Force, to carry on the deſign.

               <p>The next day being <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the firſt of <hi>Decemb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Court being ſat, the Witneſſes were called to give in their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Evidence againſt the Priſoner, of whom the firſt was Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> who being ſworn, declared, <hi>That at a meeting at</hi> Tixall, <hi>either at the latter end of</hi> Auguſt, <hi>or beginning of</hi> Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>in the Year</hi> 1678, <hi>where ſeveral were preſent; the buſineſs of that meeting was to debate and determin up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their former Reſolutions both beyond Sea, and at</hi> London <hi>before, both to take away the Life of the King and Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Popiſh Religion, wherein they came at that time to a full Concluſion;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59093:48"/>
and that the Priſoner, was there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and did with the reſt conſent to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That at another time, coming from</hi> Stafford <hi>to</hi> Tixal <hi>to Maſs he made his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to the Evidence, that it was a ſad thing the Papiſts could not ſay their Prayers but in a hidden manner, but that ere long if things took Effect, the Romiſh Religion would be Eſtabliſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That at another time, the Priſoner ſending for him to his Chamber, commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his fidelity; and for his taking away the life of the King offered him</hi> 500 <hi>l. for his Charges and Encouragement, and that he ſhould go to</hi> London <hi>with him and be under his care.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Priſoner, giving the reaſons at another time of his being ſuch an Enemy to the King was, becauſe he had been a great ſufferer for the King, but not taken notice of, but that rather Traytors and Rebels were rewarded. Which was enough were not Religion in the caſe, which was of a higher Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:59093:48"/>
                  <hi>That the Priſoner had told him, that in caſe he did kill the King, he ſhould have a free pardon for it, the King being an Excomunicated Traytor and an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he ſaw a Letter under the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners hand, to this Effect,</hi> That all things went well for carrying on the deſign, and ſo he hoped, they did here.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> being ſworn declared, <hi>That while he was in</hi> Spain, <hi>he met with ſeveral Letters ſigned</hi> Stafford, <hi>wherein he aſſured the Jeſuites that were of the Iriſh Nation, how Zealous he would be in promoting the Catholick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In other Letters the Priſoner blamed</hi> Colemans <hi>openneſs, and for Communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great Secrets to Men, of whoſe fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity his Lordſhip was not ſecure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in the Month of</hi> June 1678. <hi>The Priſoner came to Mr.</hi> Fenwick's <hi>Chamber, and there received a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from him to pay an Army, or as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59093:49"/>
near as the Dr. could remember, to be paymaſter General of the Army, aſſuring</hi> Fenwick <hi>that he was going into</hi> Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire <hi>and did not queſtion but to give a good accompt how affairs ſtood, not doubting but at his return,</hi> Grove <hi>ſhould do the buſineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Turbervile,</hi> upon his oath, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>That being Caſt off by his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for refuſing to enter into Popiſh Orders, he was put to ſhift for himſelf, to which purpoſe he went beyond Sea, to ſeek for imployment. That having ſpent ſome time at</hi> Paris <hi>without ſucceſs, and being upon his Return into</hi> England, <hi>he was recommended to the Priſoner then at</hi> Paris, <hi>who beeng informed of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, after he had been with his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſome time, told him there was a way whereby he might not only retrieve his Reputation with his Relations, but make himſelf a happy Man, and at length after many Obligations to ſecrecy, told him the King was a Heretick and a Rebel againſt God Almighty, and that it was to take away his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:59093:49"/>To this the Priſoner made, firſt a general reply, <hi>That he looked upon the Houſe of Commons as the great Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative Body of the Commons of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; <hi>and to be accuſed by them, was ſuch a load, which ſo afflicted him, that he was ſcarce able to bear up under it. Which with other things had ſo diſord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd his ſence and reaſon, that he ſcarce knew how to chear himſelf to their Lordſhips, as he ought to do; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with all Humility begged their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips pardon, if he ſaid that which might give offence, or urged any thing that might not be to the purpoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he looked upon Treaſon to be the Greateſt ſin in the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That as to the Doctrine of King-kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and abſolving perſons from their Allegiance, he could not ſay, the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>did hold it, he never heard ſo, it may be it did, it may be not. But that there was an</hi> Engliſh College <hi>of Prieſts at</hi> Rhemes, <hi>that in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations upon the</hi> Fourteenth <hi>Chapter of the Epiſtle to the Romans declared their diſlike and deteſtation of this Opinion;
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59093:50"/>
and that the Doctors of the College at</hi> Sorbonne, <hi>owned it to be a damnable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. And that for his own part he did in the preſence of Almighty God, ſolemnly declare, that he deteſted any ſuch Opinion, as he did Damnation to himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Mannagers began their Charge with telling their Lordſhips that there was a horrid deſign to Murder the King,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>wherein the</hi> Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, <hi>and all the Church of Rome were concerned; but how did that concern him? for that they had not offered one Proof, that he was of that Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he was accuſed of having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to kill the King: But that all accuſations of Treaſon ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with circumſtances, Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Concomitant and Subſequent. And the whole Compaſs of his life, had been otherwiſe. That in the beginning his late Majeſty had made him a Peer. That in the beginning of the war, he retired into</hi> Flanders; <hi>whence afterwards he came into</hi> England <hi>ond ſerved his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty Loyally and faithfully; and that he
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59093:50"/>
waited upon the preſent King in his Exile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That after he heard of the diſcovery of the Plot, had he known himſelf Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he had a fair opertunity to have run away. That he was offered the Kings Pardon if he would confeſs his fault: If then after notice he came to Town, ſuffered himſelf to be taken, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Pardon, and yet had been guilty, he ought to die for his folly as well as his Crime.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Deſcending to particulars, he deſired, <hi>that the depoſitions of Dr.</hi> Oates, <hi>upon wich he was committed by the Lord Cheif Juſtice, the depoſitions of Mr.</hi> Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale <hi>taken in the Country by Mr.</hi> Lane <hi>and Mr.</hi> Vernon, <hi>and that of Mr</hi> Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervil's <hi>taken before Sir</hi> william Polt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Warcup <hi>might be produced, that he might be able to confront what they had then ſworn in Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which the <hi>Mannagers</hi> for the Commons replyed, <hi>That if his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip could tell wherein the Witneſſes had contradicted themſelves, he might
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59093:51"/>
produce the Depoſitions. That what was ſworn was entred in the Lords Journal two years before, whither any Man might repair, but after two years time and three weekes given him to prepare for his Tryal, to deſire the producing of Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he might have done before, was only to gain time for the</hi> Viva voce <hi>Evidence to be forgotten, and therefore humbly prayed it might not be admitted. For that for a Priſoner to call for Depoſitions at the Bar from the Proſecutors, was a very ſtrange and unreaſonable demand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs the Priſoner ſtill urged the producing of the aforementioned Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavit, affirming, <hi>Mr.</hi> Turbervile <hi>had ſworn falſe in point of Time; as having ſworn one Time in his Depoſition, another in his Teſtimony at the Bar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Priſoner was asked, <hi>whether there were any other variation than that of the Time, in Mr.</hi> Turbervile's <hi>Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi>; But his Lordſhip could alledge no other that he knew of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:59093:51"/>Thereupon the Lord High Steward demanded of the Mannagers, <hi>why the Priſoner might not have the avail of his Exception.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which the Mannagers replyed, <hi>That they were not conſcious of any Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation, and that they were confident that if the thing were produced it would make againſt the Priſoner, for that the Variation to which the Priſoner excepted, had been corrected in time by the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence himſelf; however that they could not do it of themſelves without the leave of the Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thereupon the Lords withdrew to conſider, and upon their return, the Lord High Steward told the Priſoner, <hi>That their Lordſhips found an Order enter'd, for his Lordſhip to have Copies of every thing that concerned him in that Houſe; and that if he had not taken out Copies 'twas his fault. And that as for his demand of</hi> Turbervile's <hi>affidavit, their Lordſhips did not find any Obligation at all upon them (as a Court, to concern themſelves in that Matter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:59093:52"/>To this the Priſoner ſubmitted; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he deſired, <hi>That the Journal and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papers might be brought into Court, together with the two Affidavits of</hi> Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale <hi>taken by Mr.</hi> Lane <hi>and Mr.</hi> Vernon.</p>
               <p>To which the Lord High Steward made anſwer, <hi>that thoſe demands were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame Rule; that what Evidence was before the Court of Peers he ſhould have, but as for the Evidence not in Court he ought to have come provided with it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This dispute being over, the Priſoner deſired longer time, and fain would have had the Court have adjourned till the morrow after the next day.</p>
               <p>But this alſo the Mannagers of the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al oppos'd, urging, <hi>what an advantage it would be to the Priſoner to chuſe his own time to anſwer their Evidence; inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the endeavours that had been uſed to ſuborn and deſtroy Witneſſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thereupon the Lords adjourned to their own Houſe and after a ſhort Stay ſent word to the Commons, <hi>that they had ordered the Priſoner to be brought again to the Bar the next day by ten of the Clock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:59093:52"/>
                  <hi>The Third and Fourth Day</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was wholly taken up by the Priſoner in making his Defence.</p>
               <p>And firſt, he pleaded the Statute of the 13<hi>th.</hi> of this preſent King, by which no man is to be proſecuted but within ſo many Months.</p>
               <p>But to that he received a ſhort An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that he was not impeach'd upon that Statute, but upon the Common Law, and the Statute of the 25<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. which was only declarative of the Common Law; beſides, that though the Statute of the 13<hi>th.</hi> of this King, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited the Proſecution of ſome Offences to be within ſix Months, yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for Treaſon might be at any time.</p>
               <p>After that, he fell to impeach the Credit of the Witneſſes, thereby to render invalid the Teſtimony that had been given againſt him.</p>
               <p>His firſt Exceptions were againſt Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> for that his Lordſhip was not at <hi>Tixal,</hi> as the Witneſſes had ſworn, neither at the latter end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> nor at the beginning of <hi>September</hi> till the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59093:53"/>
12<hi>th.</hi> To this purpoſe, his Daughter, the Marchioneſs of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>; and one Mrs. <hi>Howard</hi> affirm'd, the firſt, at the Tryal of Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> ſhould ſay, That he was to receive Orders from his Lordſhip in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and that his Lordſhip was at a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult at <hi>Tixall</hi> in <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. <hi>Howard</hi> affirm'd, that at the ſame Tryal, being asked to be poſitive in the Month of my Lord <hi>Stafford</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down, he ſaid, that his Lordſhip came down in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi>; but that the Conſult was in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> where the Priſoner was preſent.</p>
               <p>To which it was anſwered, that the Ladies did not agree in their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; one affirming, that the Witneſs ſwore he was to come down, and the other, that he did come down; and therefore, conſidering their Relations to the Priſoner, their Teſtimony was to be look'd upon as partial.</p>
               <p>His Second Objection was, that when his Lordſhip was at <hi>Tixhall,</hi> he never ſent for the Witneſs into his Chamber; but that the Priſoner's Servant, upon his own Requeſt, brought him; and that there was no opportunity for private
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59093:53"/>
Diſcourſe, becauſe his men were in the Room all the while.</p>
               <p>For this, the Priſoner brought two of his Pages, <hi>Furneſe</hi> and <hi>Leigh,</hi> who atteſted, that they were with his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip all the while that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was in the Chamber; that he did not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that ever <hi>Dugdale</hi> was there but once; and that he does not remember, that ever his Lordſhip bid him go out of the Room.</p>
               <p>To which it was anſwered, That it was a hard Matter for men to come thus in the Negative, to remember how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Dugdale</hi> had been in my Lord's Chamber; and that it was a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a Servant to gain Credit, by ſaying, his Maſter never bid him go out of the Room in his Life: Things that might be done, and yet eſcape the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of a Servant of more Age, and leſs Inclination to ſerve their Maſters. To which might be added, that the two Young Men were Servants to the Priſoner, and of the ſame Religion; there being alſo no ſmall reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that more than ordinary practice had been uſed to prepare Evidence on the Priſoner's behalf: Beſides, it was
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59093:54"/>
obſerv'd, that <hi>Leigh</hi>'s Memory was ſomething imperfect, not remembring that <hi>Dugdale</hi> was with his Lordſhip all that day, which his Lordſhip acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, and the other Witneſſes agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>It was alſo remarkable, that <hi>Furneſe</hi> was asked by the Lord High Steward, whether he ever ſaw <hi>Dugdale</hi> alone in his Life? He anſwered, <hi>Never in his Life.</hi> To which the Lord High Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard replied, Why, you ſaw them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether that Morning you brought them to the Chamber.</p>
               <p>But to ſhew, that it was not ſuch an unuſual thing for <hi>Dugdale</hi> and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to be alone, two Witneſſes were brought for the King, <hi>Hanſon</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> who ſwore, that they had ſeen them more than once alone in private Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe together.</p>
               <p>The next thing the Priſoner endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to prove, was, that Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> ran away from the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s for Debt; to which purpoſe, he call'd <hi>Thomas Sawyer,</hi> who atteſted the ſame; and that he heard him ſay, he would be reveng'd of the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> if ever it lay in his Power: And farther, that he
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59093:54"/>
took a Glaſs of Drink, in his preſence, and wiſh'd it might be his Damnation and Poyſon, if he knew any thing of the Plot.</p>
               <p>To the firſt Objection, it was ſworn, that the Diſcourſe of the Country, was, that he went away for fear of the Plot; and three Juſtices of the Peace affirm'd, that he was apprehended upon Suſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of being in the Plot; who therefore tender'd him the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, which he took. Others ſwore, that Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi> endeavour'd to come to an Accompt with the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> while he was in the Tower; but that the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> refus'd to ſpeak with him; and that one time, Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> going to the Tower upon the ſame occaſion, one of the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants came where he was, and paying him a great deal of Reſpect, ſaid, he was as honeſt a Gentleman as ever liv'd in a Family.</p>
               <p>Other Witneſſes ſwore, that being Steward to the Lord <hi>Aſton,</hi> there was no other perſon between his Lordſhip and him; but that he was next to my Lord, and governed the reſt of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:59093:55"/>That he had always had a good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, not only with the Lord <hi>Aſton</hi>'s Tenants, but alſo with the Work-men, and thoſe people that had Dependence upon the Family.</p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Denial of his knowledge of the Plot, it was urged, that that proceeded only from the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the danger he was in; eſpecially before he had taken a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to diſcover.</p>
               <p>The next Objection was, that he ſwore falſly, when he ſaid, he told of the Letter about the Death of Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondbury Godfrey,</hi> before it was known he was kill'd; which was atteſted to the contrary by the perſons, who were ſworn to be the perſons acquainted with the ſaid Letter.</p>
               <p>But this was refuted by two Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that ſwore, the ſaid perſons were by, when the News was told; in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of which, two Gentlemen of Quality ſwore, that the Report of ſuch a thing was ſpread all over the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, before it was poſſible for it to come by the ordinary way of Intelligence. Beſides, that one of the Priſoner's Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was an Ancient deaf Man; and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59093:55"/>
ſo no wonder he ſhould atteſt that he never heard of any ſuch thing.</p>
               <p>The next Objection was, That he had corrupted perſons to ſwear falſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and others, <hi>Robinſon, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> and <hi>Holt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Robinſon,</hi> he was prov'd, by no leſs Perſons than the Earl of <hi>Maccles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Booth,</hi> a Member of Parliament, to be a meer Scoundrel and Cheat, and one that confeſs'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be a Rogue.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Holt,</hi> he was known to be a Vicious, Lewd Fellow; and one that had threatned to murther the King's Evidence, for coming in againſt the Lord <hi>Aſton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for <hi>Murral,</hi> who atteſted, that Money had been offer'd him by Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> to ſwear againſt Sir <hi>James Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Howard</hi>; he was prov'd to be a poor needy Fellow that went vagabonding about the Country.</p>
               <p>But beſides all this, in oppoſition to theſe Witneſſes on the Priſoner's ſide, in this particular, other Witneſſes were brought, who ſwore, that there, had been Endeavours to have ſuborned them to ſwear againſt Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59093:56"/>
of which one of them was profer'd 700 <hi>l.</hi> to take off his Evidence, or deſtroy him; which was done by one <hi>Pleſſington,</hi> Steward to the Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi>: And that at another time they found a Letter, for him to ſubſcribe for the blaſting of Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Reputation.</p>
               <p>His Objection to take off the Credit of Dr. <hi>Oates,</hi> was this, That he ſaid, he knew nothing of any other Perſons engaged in the Plot; and yet after that, he accus'd the Queen.</p>
               <p>But Sir <hi>Phillip Floyd</hi> being call'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by my Lord, to atteſt this Paſſage, could remember nothing of it.</p>
               <p>The Lord Privy Seal was alſo deſir'd to declare his Knowledge in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but he remember'd nothing of it neither.</p>
               <p>Neither did the Earl of <hi>Berkley</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any ſuch thing ſaid by the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor in the Council; but in the Lords Houſe, he remember'd, that the Doctor being ask'd the Queſtion, ſaid, he had no more to accuſe in relation to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but that in <hi>Ireland</hi> he had. To which it was anſwered, that this was ſaid after the Doctor had accus'd the Priſoner at the Bar, and ſo could not concern him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:59093:56"/>As to the Accuſation of the Queen, it was not poſitive, nor of his certain Knowledge, but only Circumſtantial Proof: And ſecondly, it might not be then ſo clear at that time to the Doctor, whether the Queen were a perſon ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of an Accuſation; and then again, that the Anſwer of a Man to a ſuddain Queſtion, who had ſaid ſo much, and had ſo many things in his Mind, ſhould be taken ſo ſtrictly; and that he ſhould be held for perjur'd, becauſe that he did not at that inſtant remember that particular or the Queen, was a very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Conſtruction.</p>
               <p>His next Objection againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, was, that he went to be of the Popiſh Religion, and ſo was of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which was Idolatry; and being a Turn-coat from his Religion, was not to be credited.</p>
               <p>To which it was anſwered, that there had been Men of Great Fame in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and of great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too, that had changed their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion more than once.</p>
               <p>His Objections againſt Mr. <hi>Turbervill,</hi> were, that he had ſworn, in his Affidavit, 73 and 76, for 72 and 75.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:59093:57"/>But it was prov'd by Sir <hi>William Poultney,</hi> that he came the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before any body in the World had queſtioned him upon it, and rectified the Miſtake upon his own accord.</p>
               <p>The next Objection was, That Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> was a Coward, and ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from his Colors.</p>
               <p>But to that, Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> produc'd, in Court, an Honourable and Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Diſcharge from his Commander, under Hand and Seal, which was view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Lords, without Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>Next, he brought <hi>Furneſe</hi> and <hi>Leigh</hi> again, to atteſt, that they never ſaw <hi>Turbervill</hi> with the Priſoner, at <hi>Paris</hi>; which was a Negative prov'd by his own Servants.</p>
               <p>In Anſwer to which, it was obſerv'd, That <hi>Turberville</hi> was introduc'd by grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Confidents than they were; and that it might be eaſie for Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> to come in the Company of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the Boys not take notice of him.</p>
               <p>Another Objection was this, That <hi>Turbervill</hi> had ſworn, he was not well
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59093:57"/>
us'd by the Lord <hi>Powis</hi> and his Lady, when he was well us'd. To atteſt which, he brought one to atteſt, that he was permitted to lie in a Room near the Lord <hi>Powis</hi>'s Chamber. To which it was reply'd, that that Teſtimony might not hear what unkind Words might paſs between them; or how he was thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Expectations from the Earl. And as to the Kindneſs of Mr. <hi>Turber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi>'s Relations, all that the Priſoner could prove, was, that his Brother and Siſter had given him Seven Pounds never to ſee him more.</p>
               <p>The next Objection was, That <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervill</hi> had ſworn, that the Earl of <hi>Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> was at <hi>Powis</hi>-Caſtle ſuch a time, which muſt be in the Years 72, 73, or 74; which he endeavoured to prove by the Atteſtation of one <hi>Lydcot,</hi> once a Servant to the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> and with him all thoſe Years: But he was obſerved to be ſo out in his Calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo miſtaken in the Year, and ſuch an exact Follower of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> New Stile, that Notice was taken of it by the Court.</p>
               <p>On the other Side, it was ſworn by Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> That he had not heard a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59093:58"/>
better Character of any Man, from all ſorts of People, in his Life.</p>
               <p>By Mr. <hi>Hobby,</hi> That he had never known or heard, but that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd himſelf like a Worthy, Honeſt Gentleman.</p>
               <p>By one Mr. <hi>Matthews,</hi> a Divine, that he never knew him guilty of an Evil Action; but that he was a perſon of a fair Reputation.</p>
               <p>By one Mr. <hi>Seys,</hi> That he never knew, in his Life any perſon, that could aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe him.</p>
               <p>The ſame alſo, or to the ſame Effect, was ſworn by Captain <hi>Scudamore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was farther objected, That Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> was a Stranger to the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that the Deſign of the King's Death, was too great a Secret for a Stranger to be acquainted with.</p>
               <p>To which it was anſwered, That the Quality of the Perſons that introduced him to his Lordſhip, was to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
               <p>They were Prieſts, and therefore it was no wonder, that when they brought him to his Lordſhip for ſuch a purpoſe, that they ſhould prevail with his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to give him Credit; and to deal
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59093:58"/>
with a perſon ſo likely in his Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to make ſuch an Attempt.</p>
               <p>But the main Objection was, That Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> had ſworn, that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip returned into <hi>England</hi> by the way of <hi>Calice,</hi> with Count <hi>Grammont</hi>; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which was true.</p>
               <p>To which it was anſwered, That Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> ſwore, only according to Information, and by a Lettet which ſignified to him, that his Lordſhip would return by the way of <hi>Calice</hi>; and he knew nothing of the Change of his Lorſhips Reſolution. That it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared upon Oath, that Mr. <hi>Turbervill</hi> ſtaid at <hi>Diep,</hi> in expectation of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips coming; but being inform'd, that he went another way, took the firſt Opportunity of a Paſſage; without which Information, there was no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for him to have invented ſuch a thing; or to have adviſed his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to make haſte to <hi>Calice,</hi> to take the Advantage of my Lord's Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; a thing which he did out of Friendſhip.</p>
               <p>The Evidence on both ſides, being thus clos'd, as it was thought, the Court adjourn'd, and the Lords being return'd
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59093:59"/>
to their Houſe, gave notice to the Commons, that they had order'd the Priſoner to be ſent for again the next day by ten of the Clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Firſt Day, being
Saturday Dec. 4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Priſoner being brought to the Bar, made a new Requeſt, that he might call ſome Witneſſes that he had forgot the day before, to impeach the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that had ſworn againſt the Credit of his Witneſſes, and farther, to impeach thoſe that had ſworn againſt himſelf; which though it were at firſt oppos'd, as a thing not cuſtomary, was at length conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to by the Managers, to ſpare the Lords the trouble of withdrawing.</p>
               <p>The firſt was the Lord <hi>Ferrers,</hi> as to the Reputation of Mr. <hi>Southal,</hi> one of Mr. <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s Witneſſes, who atteſted, that all he could ſay, was by Hear-ſay: That he had the Reputation of being active in the late Times againſt the King, and was counted a pernicious Man againſt the Government. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which, the Lord <hi>Brook</hi> being deſired to ſpeak what he knew of the ſaid Mr. <hi>Southal,</hi> gave him the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Character
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59093:59"/>
of an honeſt, an able, and a good Church-man; and Mr. <hi>Levenſon Gower,</hi> called to the ſame purpoſe, gave him the Character of a Zealous Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor of the Papiſts; and one of whom they that were principled by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the King and the Proteſtant Religion ſpoke well.</p>
               <p>The next was one <hi>Dale,</hi> to whom the Priſoner put the Queſtion, what he knew about <hi>Dugdale</hi>'s offering him Money, and whether <hi>Dugdale</hi> never perſuaded him to ſwear againſt my Lord <hi>Aſton</hi> ſomething he knew not?</p>
               <p>To which be anſwered poſitively in the Negative.</p>
               <p>After this, the Priſoner having ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up all his Objections before reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, againſt the King's Evidence, inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſeveral Points of Law.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That there was no Preſident, that Proceedings Criminal did ever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue from Parliament to Parliament, this having continued three.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whether a Man, in Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Caſes, was not to be proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt by Indictment, firſt found by a Grand Jury, and not by Impeachment either of a ſingle Perſon or Body of Men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:59093:60"/>Thirdly, He conceiv'd there was no Overt Act alledged in the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, He deſired to prove they were not Competent Witneſſes that ſwore againſt him; for they ſwore for Money.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Whether a Man could be condemned for Treaſon by one Witneſs, there not being two Witneſſes to any one Point.</p>
               <p>As to the Firſt, it was anſwered, that it could be no doubt, in regard their Lordſhips had reſolved, and ſent it down to the Commons; and that it was entered in their Books as the Law and Conſtitution of Parliaments; that not only Impeachments, but all Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Proceedings, continue from Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Parliament; that it was now the Law of their Houſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Law of the Kingdom. And therefore they having declared it, and ſent it down to the Commons, they had good reaſon to proceed upon the preſent Impeachment.</p>
               <p>To the Second, That an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Houſe of Commons, which is the Grand Inqueſt of the Nation, was
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:59093:60"/>
more than an Indictment, and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to bring an Offender to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>To the Third, That there were O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Acts enough in Proof, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the Impeachment; as the receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Commiſſion to be Pay-Maſter of an Army; the offering Money to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hire him to kill the King, and conſulting with ſeveral perſons met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether about killing the King, and changing the Government of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: All which were laid in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment, as fully as made out in Proof.</p>
               <p>To the Fourth, His Lordſhip inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very much, that his Council might argue it, whether there were a neceſſity of two Witneſſes to every Overt Act, alleadg'd as Evidence of High Treaſon? But the Council for the Priſoner, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Argument, as a thing impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to apply themſelves to the Study of a Caſe unforeſeen; the Lords return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Houſe to conſider upon it.</p>
               <p>In an hours time they return'd, and the Judges, according to Directions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd their Opinions in order, That if
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59093:61"/>
there were ſeveral Overt Acts, which were Evidences of the ſame Treaſon, if there were one Witneſs to prove one Overt Act, at one time, and another Witneſs, to prove another Overt Act at another time, both the Acts being Evidences of the ſame Treaſon, they were two ſufficient Witneſſes of the ſame Treaſon, and would maintain an Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or an Impeachment of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>To the Firſt, it was anſwered, That as to the hiring of the Witneſſes to ſwear, it could be no point of Law, till the Fact be prov'd; that His Majeſties Grace and Bounty to his Witneſſes, was no Objection to their Teſtimony, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very private perſon allows his Witneſſes a Maintenance, without prejudice to his Cauſe. Neither would he tax the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> who were the Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, as his Lordſhip had prov'd, to their Advantage againſt himſelf.</p>
               <p>After this, the Houſe adjourn'd, and appointed the Priſoner to be brought up again on <hi>Monday,</hi> by Ten of the Clock.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:59093:61"/>
                  <hi>The Sixth Day, being
Monday, December 6.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Priſoner being again brought to to the Bar, a Petition was read, which he had preſented to the Houſe of Peers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That whereas he had ſomething to offer to their Lordſhips, to clear himſelf; he therefore beſought their Lordſhips, that he might offer ſome Things to their Lordſhips Conſideration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he came to be heard, they were only the ſame Objections, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what varied, which he offer'd the day before, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether an Impeachment were to be proſecuted in Parliament without an Indictment? Whether words did amount to an Overt Act; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Witneſſes, in ſeveral places, did amount to a Legal Teſtimony?</p>
               <p>Upon which, being ask'd by the High Steward, whether he had any thing more to ſay? He went on again with new Repetitions, That he had not been prov'd a Papiſt; that he hop'd he had clear'd his Innocency, by making ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the Perjury of the Witneſſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:59093:62"/>Then, as if he had intended to make a kind of a Diſcovery, he told a long Story, That he believ'd, that ever ſince the Reformation, the Papiſts had had ſeveral wicked Plots and Deſigns, as <hi>Babington</hi>'s, and the Earl of <hi>Weſtmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Plot, in the Reign of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>; the Lord <hi>Grey</hi>'s, Lord <hi>Cobham</hi>'s, and Lord <hi>Brooks</hi>'s, in the Reign of King <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he did believe, that <hi>Coleman</hi>'s endeavouring, by Money out of <hi>France,</hi> to keep off Parliaments, was that which he could not juſtifie by Law; and he did believe by the ſame Letters, that ſome Conſultations had been had, for a Toleration; and that if he had known as much then, as he did ſince, he might have prevented many things.</p>
               <p>Then he fell again to his points of Law, and a third Repetition of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Objections againſt the Witneſſes; and at laſt, concluded with an Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Lords, courting their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his Innocence, and giving them to underſtand the great Confidence he had of their Juſtice and Imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:59093:62"/>Being ask'd again, whether he had done? He would fain have prevail'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for his Council to have been heard upon the points of Law before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; But the Managers of the Tryal replied, That there was nothing that deſerv'd an Anſwer; that there had been nothing offer'd new, but what had been over-rul'd already, unleſs it were a point of Law that aroſe upon matter of Fact not prov'd. That the laſt day, all had been ſaid by his Lordſhip that he had to ſay; and therefore to begin the matter again, was a thing not to be admitted. After which the Court ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Seventh Day, being
Tueſday, December 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lords took their Places in Court, at what time, the Lord High Steward, attended by Garter, Principal King at Arms; the Uſher of the Black Rod, collected the Verdicts of the Lords, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the Youngeſt Baron; the Priſoner being abſent.</p>

               <p>Being thus found Guilty, by the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage of twenty four Voices, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner was brought to the Bar, and ask'd what he had more to ſay for himſelf, why Sentence of Death ſhould not be pronounced againſt him, according to the Law?</p>
               <p>To which he made Anſwer, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of Judgment; That he never ſaw any Tryal, where the Party try'd did not hold up his Hand; which he never was ask'd to do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That though he had been try'd by the Act of 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. yet there being nothing more in that Act, than what was included in the Act of the 13<hi>th.</hi> of this King, he humbly conceiv'd, that by that Act, and the laſt Proviſo in it, a Peer that is found Guilty of the Crimes therein mentioned, was only to loſe his Seat in Parliament; and that was to be all his puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59093:65"/>Which being all he had to ſay, the Court adjourn'd into the Lords Houſe, at what time, the Commons, with their Speaker, went to the Bar of the Lords, and there, in the Name of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> demanded Judgment againſt the Priſoner.</p>
               <p>Whereupon the Lords took it into Conſideration what Judgment was to be given: Some Debate there was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Matter; but at length, the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es being demanded, gave in their Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, That there was no other Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Treaſon, appointed by Law, but to be Drawn, Hang'd and Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Attorney General</hi> alſo declared, That any other Judgment would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to his Majeſty, and be a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in the Inferiour Courts, as to his Attainder of High Treaſon.</p>
               <p>Whereupon it was order'd by the Lords, that the ordinary Judgment by the Law appointed, in Caſes of High Treaſon, ſhould be pronounced upon the Priſoner.</p>
               <p>Which being concluded, the Lords return'd to the Court; and the Lord High Steward, attended by all the

               <q>
                  <p>That what his Lordſhip had ſaid in Arreſt of Judgment, was found to be of no Moment at all, it being no Eſſential part of any Tryal; neither was there any Record made of it when it was done.</p>
                  <p>That as for the Proviſo's of the 13<hi>th.</hi> Year of this King, their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips found, that they were in no ſort applicable to his Lordſhips Caſe; the proceedings againſt him not being grounded upon that Statute.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>That no Man would have thought, that a Perſon of his Quality, ſo nobly deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo conſiderable in Eſtate, ſo eminent a Sufferer in the late Times, ſo intereſted in the Preſervation of the Government, ſo obliged to the Moderation of it; and ſo perſonally and particularly oblig'd to the King and his Royal Father, ſhould ever have enter'd into a Conſpiracy, to contrive the Murther of the King, Ruin of the State, and Subverſion of Religion; and yet his Impeachment amounted to no leſs, and the Lords have found him Guilty.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Three things therefore he recommended to his Lordſhip's Conſideration, That he was now fallen into the very Pit that he was digging for others.</hi>

have conſidered often what could be the Original Cauſe of my being thus accuſed, ſince I knew my ſelf not culpable, ſo much as in a Thought; and I cannot believe it to be upon any other Account, than my being of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I have no reaſon to be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of my Religion; for it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth nothing but the Right Worſhip of God, Obedience to the King, and due Subordination to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Laws of the Kingdom; And I do ſubmit to the Articles of Faith believed and taught in the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, believing them to be moſt conſonant to the Word of God. And whereas it hath ſo much and often been objected, that the Church holds, That Sovereign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Excommunicated by the Pope, may, by heir Subjects, be Depoſed and Murdered: as to the Murder
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59093:71"/>
of Princes, I have been taught, as a matter of Faith in the Catholick Faith, that ſuch Doctrine is dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical, horrid and deteſtable, and contrary to the Law of God, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Nations; and as ſuch, from my Heart, I renounce and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominate it. As for the Doctrine of depoſing Princes, I know ſome Divines of the Catholick Church hold it; but as Able and Learned as they have writ againſt it; But it was not pretended to be the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church, that is, any point of Catholick Faith: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do here in my Conſcience declare, That 'tis my true and real Judgment, That the ſame Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of depoſing Kings, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, injurious to Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Power, and conſequently would be in me, or any other of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:59093:72"/>
his Majeſties Subjects, impious and damnable. I believe and profeſs, that there is one God, one Saviour, one Holy Catholick Church, of which, through the Mercy, Grace, and Goodneſs of God, I die a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                        <p>To my great and unſpeakable Grief, I have offended God in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, by many great Offences; but I give him moſt humble thanks, not in any of thoſe Crimes of which I was accuſed.</p>
                        <p>All the Members of either Houſe having liberty to propoſe in the Houſe what they think fit for the Good of the Kingdom, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I propoſed what I thought fit: the Houſe is judge of the fitneſs or unfitneſs of it: and I think I never ſaid any thing that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting there, or contrary to the Law and uſe of Parliaments; for
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:59093:72"/>
certainly if I had, the Lords would, as they might, have ſome way pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed me: So t am not culpable before God or Man.</p>
                        <p>It is much reported of Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, Diſpenſations, Pardons to Murder, Rebell, Lye, Forſwear, and commit ſuch other Crimes, held and given in the Church. I do here profeſs in the Preſence of God, I never learned, believed, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed any ſuch things, but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and I ſpeak this without any Equivocation or Reſervation whatſoever: And certainly, were I guilty either my ſelf, or knew of any one that were guilty, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that were ſo, of any of thoſe Crimes of which I am accuſed, I were not only the greateſt Fool imaginable, but a perfect Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and as wicked as any of thoſe that ſo falſly have accuſed me, if
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59093:73"/>
I ſhould not diſcover any ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign I knew in any kind, and ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diſcovery ſave my Life, I having ſo often had ſo fair occaſions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed unto me, and ſo am guilty of Self-murder, which is a moſt grievous and hainous ſin. And though I was laſt impeached at the Lords Bar, yet I have great grounds to believe, that I was firſt brought to Tryal on the belief, that to ſave my Life <hi>I</hi> would make ſome great Diſcovery; and truly ſo <hi>I</hi> would, had <hi>I</hi> known any ſuch thing of an ill Deſign, or illegal dangerous Plot, either of my ſelf, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſon whoſoever, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. But had <hi>I</hi> a thouſand Lives, <hi>I</hi> would loſe them all, rather than falſly accuſe either my ſelf, or any other whoſoever: And if <hi>I</hi> had known of any Treaſon, and ſhould thus deny it, as <hi>I</hi> do now
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59093:73"/>
upon my Salvation, at this time, <hi>I</hi> ſhould have no hope of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which now <hi>I</hi> have through the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I</hi> do beſeech God to bleſs his Majeſty, who is my Lawful King and Sovereign, who <hi>I</hi> was always by all Laws Humane and Divine, bound to obey. And <hi>I</hi> am ſure, that no Power upon Earth, either ſingly or altogether can legally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, or any Body elſe, to lift a Hand againſt him or his Legal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. <hi>I</hi> do hold, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Government of this Kingdom, is the only way to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Peace and Quietneſs; which God long continue.</p>
                        <p>Next to Treaſon, <hi>I</hi> hold Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in abhorrence, and have ever done, and do; and I do ſincerely profeſs, that if <hi>I</hi> could at this time free my ſelf immediately, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59093:74"/>
what Religion <hi>I</hi> would, and what Government <hi>I</hi> would, and make my ſelf as Great as <hi>I</hi> could wiſh, and all by the Death of one of thoſe Fellows that by their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries have brought me to the place where <hi>I</hi> am, <hi>I</hi> ſo much abhorr to be the cauſe of any mans Death, that <hi>I</hi> would not any way be the Cauſe of their Murder. How much leſs would <hi>I</hi> endeavour the Aſſaſſination of his Majeſty, whom <hi>I</hi> hold to be as Gracious a King, as ever this, or any other Nation had, and under whom the People may enjoy their Liberties as much as ever any did: And if it pleaſe God to grant him Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, according as <hi>I</hi> have always wiſhed and prayed for, <hi>I</hi> am mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally perſuaded, that he and all his Dominions will be as happy and proſperous as ever any People
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59093:74"/>
were; which I beſeech God grant.</p>
                        <p>I do moſt humbly ask Pardon of the Almighty and All-Merciful God, all the great Offences I have committed againſt his Divine Majeſty; and <hi>I</hi> know he would not have the Death and Confuſion of a Sinner, but that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and live: in that Aſſurance <hi>I</hi> hope, knowing he never deſpiſeth a Contrite Heart; and though <hi>I</hi> have not ſo feeling a Contrition as <hi>I</hi> would, yet <hi>I</hi> have it as well as I can; and <hi>I</hi> doubt not, but that God will accept of the Good Will.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I</hi> deſire, that all People will forgive me any injury that <hi>I</hi> have done them in any thing, either wilfully or by Chance; and <hi>I</hi> do heartily-forgive all Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World that have injured me; and I forgive even thoſe perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Men that ſo falſly have brought

me hither by their Perjury.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I</hi> do now upon my Death and Salvation aver; that <hi>I</hi> never ſpoke one word either unto <hi>Oates</hi> or <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bervill,</hi> or to my knowledge; ever ſaw them until my Tryal; and for <hi>Dugdale, I</hi> never ſpoke unto him of any thing, but about a Foot-by, or Foot-man, or Foot-race; and never was then alone with him. All the puniſhment that <hi>I</hi> wiſh them, is, That they may repent, and acknowledge the Wrong they have done me; then it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how innocent <hi>I</hi> am. God forgive them, <hi>I</hi> have a great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that it will pleaſe Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, and that he will in a ſhort time bring Truth to Light; then you and all the World will ſee and know what injury they have done me.</p>

                           <hi>I</hi> hope <hi>I</hi> have made it appear that <hi>I</hi> have ſome Conſcience; for if <hi>I</hi> had none, certainly <hi>I</hi> would have ſaved my Life by acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf Guilty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I could have done, tho' I know I am not in the leaſt Guilty.

                        <p>
                           <hi>I</hi> have ſaid thus much in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my Conſcience, and do aver, upon my Salvation, what I have ſaid to be really true.</p>

                        <p>Concluding, That being ſo ready on his part, to ſatisfie their Deſires, he deſired to know how he ſhould be aſſiſted by them, and what they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from <hi>Him</hi>?</p>
                        <p>This Speech being reported by the Speaker, they reſolv'd into a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the whole Houſe. After which, the Speaker reſuming the Chair, they came to ſeveral Reſolves, <hi>Nemine contradicente,</hi> 1. That one way for the ſuppreſſing of Popery, was to baniſh all the Conſiderable Papiſts out of <hi>England.</hi>
                           <pb n="154" facs="tcp:59093:81"/>
That as long as the Papiſts had any hopes of the D. of <hi>York</hi>'s Succeſſion, both the Proteſtant Religion, and the Lives, Liberties and Properties of the King's Proteſtant Subjects were in Danger to be deſtroy'd. 3. That there ſhould be a Bill brought in, for the Aſſociation of his Majeſties Proteſtant Subjects, for the Safety of King, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and People, againſt all Invaſions, or Oppoſitions whatſoever; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Succeſſion of the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Papiſt.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 16<hi>th.</hi> was ſpent for the moſt part in reading of Bills.</p>
                        <p>The next day, being <hi>Friday,</hi> the 17<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> upon a Report, by Sir <hi>William Poultney,</hi> from the Committee, appointed to draw up the Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi>; the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Impeachment were order'd to be Ingroſs'd, and Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi> to be taken into Cuſtody, by the Serjant at Arms, who was impowered to take Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for his forth-coming.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Saturday,</hi> being the 18<hi>th.</hi> they took in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſerious Conſideration, his Majeſties Laſt Speech; and after ſome debate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, that an Addreſs ſhould be prepar'd in anſwer to it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="155" facs="tcp:59093:81"/>
                           <hi>Monday</hi> the 20<hi>th.</hi> produc'd nothing at that time remarkable, but only the Addreſs, which was then read and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to, and preſented the next day.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Tueſday,</hi> the 21<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> not much more was done than upon the day before, only that an Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was given into the Houſe, that one <hi>Henry Carew,</hi> a Fryar, of Saint <hi>Maloes,</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> had, for ſeveral Years laſt paſt, executed the Office of Surveyor of the Cuſtomes in the Port of <hi>Briſtol</hi>; and thereupon, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to the Committee, appointed to receive Informations concerning the Plot, to examine the Buſineſs, and make their Report.</p>
                        <p>In the Afternoon, they preſented their Addreſſes to his Majeſty, in the Banquetting-Houſe, in Anſwer to his Laſt Speech; of which, the Chief Heads were theſe:</p>
                        <p>That they did gratefully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Majeſties Goodneſs, in renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Aſſurances of his Readineſs to concurr with them for the Security of the Proteſtant Religion; but that they obſerv'd, there was a Reſervation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59093:82"/>
which if inſiſted on, would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all his other Inclinations of no Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them.</p>
                        <p>That as to the preſervation of the Succeſſion in its Legal Courſe, they had not endeavour'd any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, except only of the Deſcent upon the Perſon of the D. of <hi>York,</hi> whom the Inſtruments of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> had perverted to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For which Reaſon they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it as the Iſſue of their moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate Thoughts, That for the Papiſts to have their Hopes continued in the Expectation of a Popiſh Prince, was utterly inconſiſtent with the Safety of his perſon, the Preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Welfare of his people.</p>
                        <p>They farther repreſented to him the Danger of his Perſon, from the principles of the Papiſts, which allow the Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and Depoſition of Princes.</p>
                        <p>That the Expectation of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, had not only encreas'd the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Papiſts in the Kingdom; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo prevail'd with others to deſert Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiſm, that they might be prepar'd for the Favor of the <hi>Popiſh Prince.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="157" facs="tcp:59093:82"/>That it had hardened the <hi>Papiſts</hi> of this Kingdom to make a Common purſe, provide Arms, and ſollicite the Aid of Foreign Princes, to impoſe <hi>Popery</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Nation.</p>
                        <p>That it was his Majeſties Glory and true Intereſt to be the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of all Proteſtants both, at Home and Abroad: But if ſuch Hopes ſhould remain, what Alliances could be made for his Majeſties Allies, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants abroad to truſt to?</p>
                        <p>Then they laid before his Majeſty the Evils that would befal from a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Succeſſion.</p>
                        <p>The Proteſtant Religion would be totally overthrown.</p>
                        <p>The Pope would be acknowledg'd a Supreme, and all things be brought under his Juriſdiction.</p>
                        <p>The Lives, Liberties and Eſtates of all Proteſtants that value their Souls, will be adjudged forfeited; in regard, that the Extirpation of <hi>Hereticks</hi> was uſed as an Argument to invite Foreign Princes to aſſiſt the Duke.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="159" facs="tcp:59093:83"/>Farther, they deſir'd him to conſider, whether, in Caſe the D. ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to Succeed, whether the Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion probable to be made againſt him, might not endanger the Deſcent of the Royal Line, but even Monarchy it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>For which Reaſons, they beſought his Majeſty, that when a Bill ſhould be tender'd him in a Parliamentary way, he would give his Royal Aſſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and, as neceſſary to fortifie the ſame, that he would alſo aſſent to another Bill, to enable his Proteſtant Subjects to aſſociate for the Defence of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Proteſtant Religion, and the Security of the Kingdom. And that as a farther Means for the Preſervation of the ſame, the Judges might be Perſons of Integrity, and true Zeal to the Proteſtant Religion, and might hold their Employments only, <hi>quamdiu ſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne geſſerint</hi>; and that the Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Deputie-Lieutenants, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices of the Peace, might be perſons of the ſame Principles, and all others diſplac'd; and ſo likewiſe for the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Officers, and Commanders in the Fleet.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="158" facs="tcp:59093:83"/>Which Requeſts of theirs being gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they would be ready to aſſiſt his Majeſty for the preſervation of <hi>Tangier,</hi> and to put the Fleet into a Condition, both to preſerve the Sovereignty of the Seas, and defend the Nation.</p>

               <p>The two next days, being the 23<hi>d.</hi> and 24<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> produc'd little for our purpoſe: Only, that upon the laſt of the two, upon a Report from the Committee, appointed to examine the Complaint againſt Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> a Miniſter, it was unanimouſly reſolved, by the Houſe, That the ſaid <hi>Thompſon</hi> had publickly defam'd his Majeſty, preach'd Sedition, villify'd the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and promoted Popery, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting Popiſh Principles, denying the Plot, and turning the ſame upon the Proteſtants; and that he had endeavo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſubvert the Liberty and Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Subject, and the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament; and that he was a Scandal and Reproach to the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59093:84"/>
Function; and thereupon order'd a Committee to prepare an Impeachment againſt him. After which, the <hi>Holydays</hi> approaching, the Houſe adjourn'd till the 30<hi>th.</hi> of the ſame Month.</p>

               <p>The Firſt Witneſs upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at the Committee, ſaid, That in a Sermon preach'd by the ſaid Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> upon the 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Jan.</hi> 79. He publickly declar'd, That the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians</hi> were perſons which the Devil bluſh'd at; and that they were worſe than either Prieſts or Jeſuits; and that the Villain <hi>Hampden,</hi> grudg'd more to give the King Twenty Shillings, which was his due by Law, for Ship-money and Loan, than to raiſe a Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
               <p>The Second Witneſs ſaid the ſame, and added, that <hi>Thompſon</hi> ſhould ſay, He ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> would be pull'd out of their Houſes, and that the Goals would be fill'd with them; and wiſh'd their Houſes burnt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:59093:84"/>The third ſaid, That Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> at another time averr'd, That for a man to receive the Sacrament from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Miniſter, than of the Pariſh where he dwelt, was Damnation to his Soul; and that he would maintain the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Witneſs ſaid, That in the Fore-mentioned Sermon, Mr. <hi>Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> declared, That there was a great talk of a Plot; but ſaid he, a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> is the Man.</p>
               <p>The Fifth, That in the ſame Sermon, Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> aſſerted, That a <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian</hi> Brother <hi>qua talis,</hi> was as great a Traytor, as any Prieſt or Jeſuit; and then condemn'd all the Proceedings of Parliaments.</p>
               <p>A Sixth, That ſpeaking of the Act for <hi>Burying in Woollen,</hi> affirm'd, That the Makers of that Law, were a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Old Fools and Fanaticks; and that he would bring a School-boy, ſhould make a better Act than that.</p>
               <p>A Seventh ſaid, That in a Sermon, while the Petitions were on Foot, he very much derided and ſcoff'd at them, comparing them with the <hi>Scotch</hi> Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, delivered at <hi>Durham,</hi> at the Head of their Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:59093:85"/>The Eighth Witneſs ſaid, That in a Funeral Sermon of one Mr. <hi>Wharton,</hi> ſpeaking in Commendation of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas'd, he ſaid, he was no Schiſmatical, Petitioning Rebell. And at another time declar'd, That ſuch as went to Lectures, were the Brats of the Devil.</p>
               <p>A Ninth, That he inveigh'd bitterly againſt Petitioning, ſaying, It was the Seed of Rebellion; that the Devil ſet 'em on Work, and would pay 'em their Wages; and that before he would ſet his Hand to ſuch a Petition, he would cut it off.</p>
               <p>A Tenth, That being with Mr. <hi>Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in the Chancel of St. <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Church in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigies is, he the ſaid <hi>Thompſon,</hi> pointing his Finger to it, ſaid, That ſhe was a Lewd, Infamous Woman; that ſhe was a Church-Robber; and that <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. began it, and ſhe finiſhed it.</p>
               <p>The Eleventh, That in the Year 78. Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> rail'd in his Sermon againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, ſaying, he did more Hurt in robbing the Abby-Lands, than he did Good by his Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:59093:85"/>The Twelfth, That he ſaid the Plot was nothing but a <hi>Presbyterian Plot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Thirteenth ſaid the ſame with the Ninth.</p>
               <p>The Fourteenth confirm'd what the Second had declared.</p>
               <p>The Fifteenth and laſt Evidence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd, That he heard Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> in Diſcourſe affirm, That if he were as well ſatisfied of other things, as he was of Juſtification, Auricular Confeſſion, Penance, Extream Unction, and Chriſm in Baptiſm, he would not have been long ſeparated from the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>That he had endeavor'd to prove Auricular Confeſſion and Extream Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction out of the Epiſtles.</p>
               <p>That he heard him ſay, the King was of a mean and ſoft Temper, eaſily led to any thing; but yet a <hi>Solomon</hi> in Vices: But that the D. was a Prince of a brave Spirit, faithful to his Friends; but it was our own Faults that he was a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> in that we forc'd him to fly into <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he would rather cut off his Hand than Sign a Petition for Sitting of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:59093:86"/>That <hi>Bedloe</hi> was not to be credited on any thing he ſaid.</p>
               <p>That it was better for a Clergy-man to be gelt, than to marry; and that the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> of <hi>France</hi> were lecherous Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> being ask'd, whether he were guilty of the Matters laid to his Charge, and deſired to make his Defence, did for the greateſt part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs words ſpoken to that Effect; and in other things, endeavoured to turn the words with more favor toward him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>But the Credit of the Witneſſes was ſuch, that the Committee was ſoon ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and made their Report to the Houſe; upon which enſued the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and Judgment of the Houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recited.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 30<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> the Houſe met again; at which time, among other things, not proper for this Continuation, it was unanimouſly reſolv'd, That no Member of the Houſe ſhould accept of any Office, or place of Profit from the Crown, without the leave of this Houſe; or any promiſe of any ſuch Office or place of profit, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:59093:86"/>
ſuch time as he ſhould continue a Member of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friday,</hi> the laſt of <hi>December,</hi> paſs'd without any material Tranſaction that requires Relation.</p>
               <p>The next day of Sitting, was the 3<hi>d.</hi> of <hi>January</hi>; upon which day, the <hi>Peers</hi> ſent a Meſſage to the Commons, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating, that they had received a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Mr. <hi>Seymour,</hi> wherein he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd a day might might be appointed for his ſpeedy Tryal; of which they thought fit to give them Notice, not finding any Iſſue by Replication.</p>
               <p>Thereupon the Articles againſt Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi> were read, and a Committee order'd to prepare Evidence againſt him, and manage the ſame at the Tryal.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time alſo, the Articles of Impeachment againſt Sir <hi>William Scroggs</hi> were read, as having been prepar'd ſome days before, by the Committee appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to examine the proceedings of the Judges, &amp;c. The Heads of which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and of the Articles themſelves, were as follows:</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, the Committee found by the Information of <hi>Charles <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mphre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile,</hi> Fore-man of the Grand Jury, for the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59093:87"/>
Hunder'd of <hi>Oſtulſton,</hi> in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and others of the ſame Jury, that upon the Second of <hi>June,</hi> 1680. the Conſtables were found defective, in not preſenting the Papiſts as they ought; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they were order'd to make farther Preſentments by the 26<hi>th.</hi> day following; upon which day they met a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to receive them. That upon the ſaid day, a Bill was brought them againſt <hi>James,</hi> D. of <hi>York,</hi> for not coming to Church. That about an hour after, they receiv'd the ſaid Bill, ſome of the Jury attended the King's Bench with a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Sitting of the Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Upon which, the Lord <hi>Scroggs</hi> raiſed many Scruples, and pretending all the Jury were not in the Court, though twenty had ſubſcrib'd, ſent for them, ſaying, he would diſpatch them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. Then the Jury being come and call'd over, renewed their deſire concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Petition; To which the C. J. ſaid, we will not make two words of the Buſineſs; adding, that the Petition was no Article of their Charge; that no Act requir'd the Court to deliver the Grand Juries Petition, or to run of their Errands; and that there was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59093:87"/>
concerning them; and that 'twas much they ſhould come to alter the King's Mind, declared in the News Book; that the Jury reply'd, that they only deſir'd it with Submiſſion, as other Juries had done; that the Court an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, that they had medled with what was never given them in Charge, but had brought in no Bills; that the Jury reply'd, they had many before them: notwithſtanding which, Judge <hi>Jones</hi> told them they were diſcharg'd from farther Service: which by the Evidence of Mr. <hi>Aſtry,</hi> Mr. <hi>Waterhouſe,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ward,</hi> appear'd not to have been done in their memory before.</p>
               <p>The next thing was, that there was a Rule of Court made, all the Judges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and nine diſſenting, againſt the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Publiſhing <hi>The Weekly Pacquet of Advice; or the Hiſtory of Popery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, That there had been a very great Latitude taken by the Judges, in impoſing Fines upon perſons found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty before them.</p>
               <p>Particularly, that <hi>John Brown</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> Gentleman, for publiſhing a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Book, call'd, <hi>The Long Parliament diſſolv'd,</hi> was fin'd a Thouſand Marks,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59093:88"/>
bound to his good Behaviour for ſeven years, and his Name ſtruck out of the Roll of Attorneys, without any Offence alleadg'd in his Practice. For which fine, not being able to pay it, he lay in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon three Years; and tho' his Majeſty was graciouſly pleas'd to pardon him, and recommended him, by his Warrant, to be reſtor'd again to his place of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, yet he could not obtain his ſaid Reſtauration from the Court of <hi>Kings Bench.</hi>

               <p>A certain paſſage, which ſeem'd to be a kind of Exhortation, or rather a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum,</hi> as it were to the Parliament, not to betray their Truſts, to this Effect, <hi>That no man ought to think it ſtrange, that it ſhould be thought Treaſon for a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to ſit and act contrary to the Laws of the Land:</hi> For that, <hi>if in the firſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of</hi> R. 2.

               <p>Whereupon, it was the unanimous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Committee, that the Court of Kings Bench, had acted arbitrarily, illegally, and partially, in favoring Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and Perſons Popiſhly affected, and oppreſſing his Majeſties Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
               <p>Proceeding farther, they found, that ſeveral of his Majeſties Subjects had been Committed, for Crimes Bailable by Law; and that their Sureties, though ſufficient, were refus'd. Among the reſt, that <hi>Henry Care</hi> had been ſo refus'd the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Right of a Subject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>George Brown,</hi> a Conſtable in <hi>London,</hi> having Committed ſome of the

L. C. Juſtice's Servants for great Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, was ſeiz'd by a Tip-ſtaff, by the L. C. Juſtice's Warrant, and committed to the Kings Bench, tho' he tender'd two able Citizens, and Common-Council-Men of <hi>London,</hi> for his Bail.</p>

               <p>That about the ſame time, <hi>Edward Berry,</hi> a Stationer in <hi>Greys Inn,</hi> being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd for ſelling the <hi>Obſervations upon Sir</hi> George Wakeman's <hi>Tryal,</hi> was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ſaid C.

                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:59093:90"/>Upon which, it was the Reſult of the Committee, that the refuſing Bail, where perſons were Bailable by Law, was ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and a high Breach of the Liberty of the Subject.</p>
               <p>After that, the ſaid Committee, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king into Conſideration an Information againſt Baron <hi>Weſton,</hi> they found, by the Teſtimonies of <hi>John Colt, Richard Mayo,</hi> and <hi>John Peiron,</hi> Gentlemen, that the ſaid Baron had us'd theſe following Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in his Charge at <hi>Kingſton</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes, <hi>That</hi> Zuinglius <hi>ſet up his Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, and that</hi> Calvin <hi>built upon that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Foundation</hi>: And, ſaid he, all his Diſciples are ſeaſon'd with ſuch a ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit, that it much concerns Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to keep a ſtrict hand over them. And now they are reſtleſs, amuſing us with Fears, and nothing will ſerve them but a Parliament, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Upon which, the Opinion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee was, that the Expreſſions in the Charge given by Baron <hi>Weſton,</hi> were a Scandal to the Reformation, in deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Rights and Priviledges of Parliaments; and tending to raiſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord between his Majeſty and his People.</p>

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59093:91"/>
the Buſineſs of the L. C.

               <p>That at the Summer Aſſizes, at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> Mr. <hi>Price,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bedloe</hi> being in Company, he fell very ſeverely in publick, upon Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> to to the diſparagement of his Evidence, and upon Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s defending Mr. <hi>Bedloe,</hi> he fell into a paſſion, and ſaid, he believ'd Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> died innocently.</p>

                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:59093:91"/>1. That being Chief Juſtice of the King's Bench, he had endeavor'd to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Fundamental Laws and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd Religion and Government of the Kingdom, and to introduce Popery and Arbitrary Government.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That contrary to his Oath, taken duly to adminiſter Juſtice, he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd the Grand Jury for the Hunder'd of <hi>Oſſulſton,</hi> before they had made their Preſentments, or found the Bills of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment that were before them, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the known courſe of the ſaid Court; by which illegal Diſcharge, the Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of many Papiſts, and other Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, were obſtructed, and a Bill againſt the <hi>D.</hi> of <hi>Y.</hi> for not coming to Church, was prevented from being proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he had caus'd an illegal and arbitrary Rule to be enter'd into the Kings Bench, againſt the Printing of the <hi>Weekly Pacquet of Advice from</hi> Rome; <hi>or the Hiſtory of Popery</hi>; wherin the Cheats, and Superſtitions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were from time to time expos'd; to the manifeſt countenancing of Popery, and Diſcouragement of Proteſtants.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That he had moſt notoriouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59093:92"/>
from all Rules of Juſtice and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, in the impoſition of Fines upon perſons convicted of Miſdemeanors.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That he had frequently refus'd to accept of Bail, though ſufficient and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally tender'd him by ſeveral perſons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd before him, for Crimes which were Bailable by Law; ſeveral of the ſaid perſons being only accus'd of Offences againſt himſelf; declaring at the ſame time, that he refus'd Bail, and commited them only to put them to Charges.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That he had granted divers Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Warrrants for attacquing the perſons, and ſeizing the Goods of his Majeſties Subjects, not nam'd, or particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd in the ſaid Warrants; by means wherof their Houſes have been enter'd, &amp; their perſons oppreſt contrary to Law.</p>
               <p n="7">7. That tho' he had Try'd and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd ſeveral of the Offenders in the late horid Horid Popiſh Plot, for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the King, &amp;c. Yet he had at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times and places openly defam'd and ſcandaliz'd ſeveral of the Witneſſes who had prov'd the Treaſons of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators; by which means, he did as much as in him lay, endeavor to ſuppreſs and ſtifle the Diſcovery of the ſaid Plot.</p>

                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:59093:92"/>8. That his frequent and notorious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and Debaucheries, and his prophane and Atheiſtical Diſcourſes, were a daily af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to God, a diſhonor to his Majeſty, and gave Countenance to all manner of Vice and Wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>Thereupon it was pray'd, that the ſaid Sir <hi>William Scroggs</hi> might be put to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Premiſſes, and be in the mean time committed to ſafe Cuſtody.</p>
               <p>But the Crimes objected againſt him, not being look'd upon as Capital, he was Bail'd by the Earl of <hi>Dorſet</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Hatton,</hi> who became Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for his Forth-coming; during which time, his Lordſhip ceas'd to act in his Place, or to appear in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall, as Chief Juſtice.</p>

                  <hi>That he had received their Addreſs, with all the diſpoſition they could wiſh, to comply with their reaſonable Deſires; but that he was ſorry to ſee their Thoughts ſo wholly fix'd upon the Bill of Excluſion, as to determine all other Remedies for the ſuppreſſing of Popery ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual</hi>; but that he was confirm'd in his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59093:93"/>
againſt it, by the Judgment of the Lords who had rejected it; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there remain'd nothing more for him to anſwer, but to recommend to them all other means for the preſervation of the Proteſtant Religion, in which they could have no reaſon to doubt of his Concurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when they ſhall be preſented him in a Parliamentary way. As alſo, to conſider the preſent State of the Kingdom, as well as the condition of Chriſtendom; ſo as to enable him to ſecure <hi>Tangier,</hi> and ſecure his Alliances abroad.</p>
               <p>The ſame morning, a Meſſage was ſent from the Lords, to acquaint the Houſe with a Vote which they had paſs'd, declaring, that they were fully ſatisfied, that there was, and, for divers years, had been, a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid and Treaſonable Plot and Conſpiracy carried on by the Popiſh Party in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for Maſſacring the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and Subvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Proteſtant Religion, and the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd Government of that Kingdom.</p>

                  <hi>Friday,</hi> the Articles of Impeachment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sir <hi>William Scroggs,</hi> were carried up to the Lords, by the Lord <hi>Cavendiſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Morning, the Houſe taking into conſideration his Majeſties laſt Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, made ſeveral Reſolves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there was no Security for the Proteſtant Religion, the King's Life, or the Eſtabliſh'd Government of the Kingdom, without paſſing a Bill for diſabling the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> to Inherit the Imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. And that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon any other means or Remedies, was not only inſufficient, but dangerous.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That unleſs a Bill were paſs'd for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> the Houſe could not give any Supply to his Majeſty, without danger to his Majeſties Perſon, the hazard of the Proteſtant Religion, and Breach of Truſt in them to the People.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That they who had advis'd the King to inſiſt upon an Opinion againſt the Bill, had given him pernicious Counſel, and were promoters of Popery, and Enemies <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o the King and Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That it was the Opinion of the Houſe,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59093:94"/>
that the E. of <hi>Hallifax,</hi> the Margueſs of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and the E. of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> were the perſons that gave the King that pernicious Advice: And that therefore an Addreſs ſhould be made, for their Removal from the King's Perſon and Preſence, and from their Offices and Employments.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Feverſham</hi> was alſo voted a promoter of Popery, and the <hi>French</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and a dangerous Enemy to the King and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The ſame day alſo, they made two other Reſolves, That whoſoever ſhould lend, or cauſe to be lent, any Mony, upon the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the King's Revenue, ariſing by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Exciſe, or Hearth-mony, ſhould be adjudg'd Obſtructors of the Sitting of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, and be reſponſable in Parliament.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That whoſoever ſhould accept or buy any Tally of Anticipation, upon any part of the King's Revenue; or whoever ſhould pay ſuch Tally, ſhould be deem'd guilty of of the ſame Offence, and be liable to be queſtion'd in Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saturday</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Jan.</hi> the Lords gave notice to the Houſe, that they had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Saturday</hi> following, to hear Mr. <hi>Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi>'s Cauſe upon his Impeachment; and that the Houſe might reply, if they thought fit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:59093:94"/>
                  <hi>Monday</hi> the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Jan.</hi> being the laſt day of their Seſſion, ſeveral Reſolves were made.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That whoever advis'd his Majeſty to prorogue the Parliament, to any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, than in order to the paſſing the Bill of Excluſion, was a Betrayer of the King, the Kingdom, and the Proteſtant Religion, and a Penſioner to <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Members for the City of <hi>London,</hi> ſhould return the Thanks of the Houſe to the City, for their manifeſt Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the King, their Charge, and Vigilancy, for the preſervation of his Majeſty, and the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it was their Opinion, that the City was burnt by the Papiſts, deſigning to introduce Popery and Arbitrary Power in the Nation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That the Commiſſioners of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms had willfully broken the Law, for prohibiting the <hi>Importation</hi> of French <hi>Wines</hi> and other Commodities; which, if they ſhould continue, they ſhould be queſtion'd in Parliament.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That it was their Opinion, that the D. of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> had been remov'd from his Offices and Commands, by the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the D. of <hi>York</hi>; and therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59093:95"/>

                  <p>BEing fully ſatisfied with the accompt which you gave me, of the Proceedings of the laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> I took my flight into the Country, thinking to have
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:59093:120"/>
open'd my Pacquet: But when I came there I could hardly find any Body at home; all People were ſo buſied with the New Elections, and taken up with future expectations, that they little minded what was paſt. Thereupon I reſolv'd to ſtay a while before I expos'd my ſelf to thoſe, whoſe thoughts I found were bent another way. Upon theſe conſiderations, I followed the Croud to <hi>Oxford.</hi> But I had hardly trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med my Weather beaten Wings, before the Parliament was diſſolved there too. So then I thought it my beſt way to come up to <hi>London</hi> again, and find out my Old Friend <hi>Truth,</hi> and then to take my Progreſſes with a compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Relation.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore I deſire thee to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me with an Accompt of the main Tranſactions in this ſame ſhort Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Oxford.</hi>

                  <p>Know then that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being appointed to meet upon the 21ſt. of <hi>March</hi> 1681. And the time of Seſſions approaching, the King upon the Twelf of <hi>March</hi> removed to <hi>Windſor,</hi> Upon the Fourteenth he removed to <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and in his way was met upon the Borders of the County, by the High Sheriff with his Attendants, and at <hi>Whateby</hi> by the Lord <hi>Norris,</hi> Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the County, with ſuch an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Gentry, that hardly any were found miſſing, but ſuch as were known to be hindred by Sickneſs, or other lawful Impediment. By whom together with the Two Troops of the County <hi>Militia</hi>; his Majeſty was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-Gate of the City, where he was received by the Mayor, and the reſt of the City Magiſtrates; and the Recorder, Serjeant <hi>Cook,</hi> welcom'd in a ſet Speech; and after the uſual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59093:121"/>
made by the Maior, and among the reſt of the Mace, which was return'd; the Mayor then carrying the Mace before his Majeſty, with the reſt of the Brethen, attended his Majeſty to <hi>Chriſt</hi>-Church-Gate. After that the King paſſing to his Appartment in the Colledge, was received by the Biſhop with a <hi>Latin</hi> Speech upon his Knes attended by the Canons; and the next Morning was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Vice-Chancellour, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Profeſſors, Proctors and Univerſity Orator. The Vice-Chancellor laid the Beadle's Staves at the Kings Feet; and then the Orator addreſſed himſelf in <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> to the King—and in <hi>Engliſh</hi> to the Queen, the Vice-Chancellor, Orator, and Doctors kneeling all the while.</p>

                  <p>Upon the 21ſt of <hi>March,</hi> the parliament met according to Summons, at <hi>Oxford,</hi> in the Convocation Houſe; at what time his Majeſty went to the Houſe of Lords, which State in the <hi>Geometry</hi>-School and being ſeated in his Throne, with his Royal Robes and the uſual Solemnities, declar'd himſelf in a
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59093:121"/>
Gratious Speech to Both Houſes, to the Effect as followes.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>That the unwarrantable Proceedings of the laſt Houſe of Commons, were the reaſon of his parting with them; for that he who would never uſe Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Government himſelf, would not ſuffer it in others. That whoever calmly conſider'd the Aſſurances he had renewed to that laſt Parliament, and what he had recommended to them, his Forreign Alliances, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the Plot, and the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Tangier,</hi> and reflect upon their unſuitable returns, might rather won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at his Patience then that he grew weary of their Proceedings; that it was his Intereſt, and ſhould be as much his Cauſe as theirs to preſerve the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Subject, the Crown not being ſafe when that is in danger. That by calling this Parliament ſo ſoon, he let them ſee, that no Irregularities of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſhould make him out of Love with them: by which means he gave them another Oppertunity to provide for the Publick ſecurity, and had given one Evidence more, that he had not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his part.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="234" facs="tcp:59093:122"/>
That he hoped, the ill Succeſs of former heats would diſpoſe them to a better Temper.</p>
                     <p>That as for the further Proſecution of the Plot, tryal of the Lords, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he omited to preſs them, as being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to conſideration, and ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Publick ſafety. But deſired them not to lay ſo much weight upon any one Expedient againſt Popery, as to determine that all other were ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>'That what he had ſo often declared 'touching the Succeſſion, he ſhould not recede from. But that to remove all reaſonable Fears, that might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the Poſſibility of a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſſor, if means could be found that in ſuch a Caſe the Adminiſtration ſhould remain in <hi>Proteſtant</hi> hands, He ſhould be ready to hearken to any ſuch expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent by which Religion might be ſecur'd and Monarchy not deſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, He adviſed them to make the Known and Eſtabliſh Laws of the Land the Rules and Meaſures of their Votes.</p>
                  <p>Which done he commanded the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to return to their Houſe and make choice of their Speaker. Thereupon
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:59093:122"/>
Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> Speaker of the laſt Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being again made choice of, and conducted to the Chair, made a ſhort Speech to the Houſe upon his Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>That the Unamious choice of the Houſe had leſt him without excuſe to diſable himſelf for their Service, it being to be ſuppos'd that who the Commons Elected was fit for the Truſt.</p>
                     <p>That it did not become him to offer aſſurance of his Conſtancy, Fidelity, and Vigilancy, the juſt Sence of the Honour conferred upon him, being an Engagement for him to do and ſuffer whatever Fleſh and Blood could do and ſuffer in their choice.</p>
                     <p>That it was a time not to ſpeak much, but act well, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired that their Debates might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and orderly without reflection or paſſion, and that his behaviour might have their kind and candid Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Upon <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 22d of <hi>March,</hi> the Commons attended his Majeſty in the Lord's Houſe; at which time Mr. Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker humbly repreſented in another Speech.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>That the Commons in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:59093:123"/>
to his Royal pleaſure for the diſpoſal of themſelves in that great Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly to ſerve him, had with one voice elected him their Speaker, as having had the Honour to ſerve his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and the Commons in that Truſt in the laſt Parliament.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon with all humility he did again by their Command to receive his pleaſure with a Head and Heart full of Loyalty to his Sacred Perſon, armed with a ſettled reſolution never to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his Majeſties ancient and well ſettled Government.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>To which the Lord Chancellor in few words made Anſwer, That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty had well conſidered the Choice, and did very well approve of the Election, and allowed him for Speaker.</p>
                  <p>Then Mr. Speaker made another Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to his Majeſty, ſetting forth how much his Majeſties Grace and favour in the laſt Parliament, continu'd by the Honour he had in the next, did encreaſe his Obligations to Loyalty. That as he was ſet in a High Station, ſo he would endeavour to manifeſt his uprightneſs in it; believing that his Majeſties ſervice in that great Place was one and the ſame
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59093:123"/>
with that of his Commons, no more to be divided then his Crown and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
                  <p>After which, he made an humble claim in the Name of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> of all the Ancient Rights for them and their Servants, freedom of Speech in their debates, and liberty of acceſs to his Perſon, according to Cuſtome.</p>
                  <p>Concluding by way of Petition to his Majeſty, that nothing by him ſaid, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through weakneſs or inadvertency, ſhould tend to the prejudice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and that his behaviour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings might receive a favourable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation from his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>To which the Lord Chancellor by his Majeſties command reurned for Anſwer, That their Petitions were fully and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted, in as large and ample manner as ever any Houſe enjoy'd them; his Majeſty being aſſur'd that the Houſe would make as prudent a uſe of them, as ever any of their Anceſtors; and that his own particuar Petition was grateful to the King too, knowing that he would be as ready to avoid, as the King to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give miſtakes. The next day being the Twenty-third, was ſpent in taking the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59093:124"/>
Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and ſubſcribing the Declaration directed by the Act made in the Thirteenth year of the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Twenty-Fourth produc'd little remarkable, ſeveral Petitions about Elections were preſented; and an Order made for ſetting the next <hi>Saturday</hi> aſide to conſider of a means for ſecuring the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and the ſafety of the Kings Perſon.</p>
                  <p>The Twenty-Fift of <hi>March,</hi> being <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> the Lords ſent down the Anſwer of Sir <hi>William Scrogs</hi> to the Articles of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment exhibited againſt him by the former Parliament, together with his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition to the houſe of Peers. But nothing was done in it; for the Houſe fell upon three affairs of Higher concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The firſt was the conſideration of the matter relating to a Bill, which had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed both Houſes in the laſt Parliament, Entitl'd, An Act for Repeal of a Statute made in the Thirty-Fift Year of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> but was not tendered to his Majeſty for his Royal Aſſent. Whereupon it was reſolv'd that a Meſſage ſhould be ſent to the Lords, to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:59093:124"/>
deſire a Conferencc as to matters relating to the Conſtitution of Parliaments in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Bills; and Ordered a Committee to prepare what was fit to be offered at the ſaid Conference.</p>
                  <p>Another Meſſage was alſo Ordered to be ſent to the Lords to put them in mind, that the Commons had formerly by their Speaker demanded judgment of High Treaſon at their Barr againſt the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi>; and therefore to deſire their Lordſhips to appoint a day to give judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him the ſaid Earl upon the ſaid Impeachment.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day the Examination of <hi>Ed. Fits-Harris,</hi> relating to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Plot was read in the Houſe. Upon which the ſaid Examination was Ordered to be Printed, the ſaid <hi>Fits-Harris</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached at the Lords Barr, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee appointed to draw up Articles againſt him.</p>
                  <p>The Sum of <hi>Fits-Harris</hi>'s Examination was this, That in the Year 1672. One <hi>Father-Gough,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſt ſhould tell him at <hi>Paris,</hi> that within two Years after, he ſhould ſee the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion eſtabliſhed in <hi>England.</hi> To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe if the King would not comply, that
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59093:125"/>
Order was taken that he ſho<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ld be taken off and kill'd.</p>
                  <p>That the ſame Prieſt told him, that the D. of <hi>T.</hi> was a <hi>Catholick,</hi> ſo made by his Mother, in whoſe Reign there would be no difficulty of doing it.</p>
                  <p>And farther, that the Declaration of Indulgence, and the War againſt <hi>Holland</hi> were in Order to the introducing of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the ſame Author reported to him, That <hi>Madam</hi> came over to <hi>Dover,</hi> about the ſame deſign.</p>
                  <p>That he knew ſeveral Commanders in the Army muſtered upon <hi>Black-Heath,</hi> to be <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi>'s, and that it was the common Intelligence and Opinion among them that the ſaid Army was rais'd to bring in the <hi>Romon-Catholick</hi>-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That in the Year 1679. Marqueſs <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecuculi,</hi> the D. of <hi>Modena</hi>'s Envoy, told him, if he would undertake to kill the King, either in his own Perſon, or by any other, he ſhould have Ten-Thouſand pound.</p>
                  <p>That the ſame Marqueſs told him, that upon killing the King, the Army in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and Parts adjoying to <hi>France,</hi> was to
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59093:125"/>
come over to deſtroy the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, after which there ſhould be no more Parliaments in <hi>England</hi>; and that the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> was privie to all theſe deſigns. That in the Year 1680. He met <hi>Kelley</hi> the Prieſt at <hi>Calice,</hi> who owned himſelf to be one of the Murtherers of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> and that the ſame was done, much as <hi>Prance</hi> had related it; and,</p>
                  <p>That Monſieur <hi>De-Puy</hi> a Servant to the D. of <hi>Y.</hi> had told him, ſoon after the ſaid Murther was committed, that the ſaid Murther was conſulted at <hi>Windſor</hi>; and farther told him, that there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of taking off the King, and that it would ſoon be done; with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſages of leſs remark to the ſame purpoſe. Upon this Information Mr. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Jenkins</hi> was Ordered to go up and impeach the ſaid <hi>Fits-Harris,</hi> at the Barr of the Lords Houſe.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, that is to ſay, in the forenoon of the next day, being <hi>Saturday</hi> the 26 of March; other Examinations of Mr. <hi>John Serjeant</hi> and <hi>David Maurice,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the <hi>Popiſh</hi>-Plot were Read, and Ordered to be Printed. That of <hi>Serjeant</hi> was ſhort, that a Gentlewoman an Acquaintance of his in <hi>Flanders,</hi> one Mrs.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59093:126"/>
                     <hi>Skipwith</hi> told him, That <hi>Gawen,</hi> one of the Five <hi>Jeſuits</hi> which were Hang'd, had maintain'd againſt a ſcruple of Conſcience by her put, that the Queen might not only lawfully kill the King for violating her Bed, but was bound to do it, and that if ſhe did not, ſhe was guilty of his greater Damnation in letting him continue ſo long.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Information was ſhorter, That he heard the Gentlewoman confirm the Truth of <hi>Gawens</hi> words.</p>
                  <p>Preſently after, the Houſe taking into debate the means for the ſecurity of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion, and ſafety of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Perſon, came to a Reſolution, that a Bill ſhould be brought in for excluding <hi>James</hi> D. of <hi>York</hi> from Inheriting the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the Dominions and Territories there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to belonging.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Day in the Afternoon, the Houſe being inform'd that the Lords had refus'd to proceed upon their Impeachment of <hi>Edward-Fits-Harris,</hi> and had direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he ſhould be proceeded againſt at Common-Law, They came to three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves.</p>
                  <p>That it was the undoubted Right of the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:59093:126"/>
Commons in Parliament aſſembl'd to impeach before the Lords in Parliament: any Peer or Commoner for Treaſon, or any other Crime or Miſdemeanour, and that the Refuſal of the Lords to proceed in Parliament upon ſuch an Impeachment was a denial of Juſtice, and a violation of the Conſtitution of Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That in the Caſe of <hi>Edward Fits-Harris,</hi> who had been impeach'd by the Commons for High Treaſon before the Lords, with a Declaration, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time they would bring up Articles againſt him, for the Lords to reſolve, That the ſaid <hi>Fits-Harris</hi> ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt according to the Courſe of Common-Law, and not by way of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment in Parliament, at that time, was a violation of the Conſtitution of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and an Obſtruction to the farther Diſcovery of the <hi>Popiſh</hi>-Plot, and of great danger to his Majeſties Perſon, and the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>-Religion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly for any Inferiour Court to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt <hi>Edward Fits-Harris,</hi> or any other Perſon lying under an Impeachment in Parliament, for the ſame Crime, for which they ſtood impeached, was a High breach of the Priviledge of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:59093:127"/>After this, they Ordered two Bills to be brought in, The one for the better Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Majeſties <hi>Proteſtant</hi>-Subjects;</p>
                  <p>The other for baniſhing the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable <hi>Papiſts</hi> in <hi>England</hi> by their Names out of his Majeſties Dominions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Munday</hi> the Twenty-eighth Day of <hi>March,</hi> and laſt of the Seſſion little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſs'd, only the Bill of Excluſion was read a Second time.</p>
                  <p>But theſe and all other their debates that Morning put a ſuddain Concluſion, for ſoon after being ſent for by the King to the Houſe of Lords: his Majeſty told them, That their beginnings had been ſuch that he could expect no good ſucceſs of this Parliament, and therefore thought fit to diſſolve them, and accordingly the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor by the Kings command declared the Parliament diſſolv'd.</p>
                  <p>After the Deſſolution of the Parliament, the King went back to <hi>Windſor,</hi> the ſame Day, and from thence after a ſtay of ſome few Hours, returned to <hi>White-Hall</hi>

                              <p>Upon rejecting the Impeachment of Mr. <hi>Fits-Harris</hi>; giving for Reaſons, why it was the undoubted Right of the Commons ſo to do, becauſe great Offences that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence the Parliament, were moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually determined in Parliament, nor could the complaint be determin'd any where elſe. For that if the Party ſhould be Indicted in the Kings Bench, or any other Inferiour Court for the ſame Offence, yet it were the ſame Suit; an Impeachment being at the ſuite of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but an Indictment at the ſuite of the King. Beſides that they conceived it to be a denial of Juſtice, in regard the Houſe of Peers, as to Impeachments, proceeding by Vertue of their Judicial, not their Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Power, could not deny any Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, but more eſpecially the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> no more then the Courts of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> or any other Inferiour Courts could deny any Suite or Criminal Cauſe regularly Commenced before them. </p>

                  <p>Upon the <hi>Munday</hi> next after <hi>Eaſter-Week,</hi> came forth His Majeſties Declaration, ſhewing the Cauſes and Reaſons that mov'd him to diſſolve the Two laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments.</p>
                  <p>Wherein after he had ſet forth with how much reluctancy he did it, and how abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute his Intentions were to have comply'd, as far as would have conſiſted with the very being of the Government, with any thing that could have been propos'd to him for preſerving the Eſtabliſh'd Religion, the Liberty and Property of the Subject at home, and ſupporting the Forraign Allian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he took notice of the unſuitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of the Houſe of Commons; their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes in the Nature of Remonſtrances; their Arbitrary Orders for taking Perſons into Cuſtody for Matters that had no Relation to their Priviledges; and their
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:59093:128"/>
ſtrange Illegal Votes declaring divers Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Perſons, Enemies to the King and Kingdom, without any Order or Proceſs of Law or hearing their Defence.</p>
                  <p>That beſides theſe Proceedings they had Voted,</p>
                  <p>That whoever ſhould Lend any Money upon the Branches of the Revenue, or Buy any Tally of Anticipation, or pay any ſuch Tally ſhould be adjudged to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſitting of Parliaments, and be anſwerable to the ſame in Parliament. Which Votes, inſtead of giving him Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, tended rather to diſable him, and to expoſe him to all dangers that might happen at Home or Abroad, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of the poſſibility of ſupporting the Government it ſelf, and to reduce him to a more helpleſs Condition then the meaneſt of his Subjects.</p>
                  <p>That they had Voted the Proſecution of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Diſſenters, upon the Penal-Laws a grievance to the Subject, a weakning to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt, an Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Popery,</hi> and dangerous to the Peace of the Kingdom. Whereby they aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to themſelves a Power of ſuſpending Acts of Parliament. Which unwarrantable Proceedings were the Occaſion of his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59093:129"/>
with the firſt Parliament. That ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Aſſembled another at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he gave them warning of the Errors of the former, and required them to make the Law of the Land their Rule, as he reſolv'd it ſhould be his. Adding withal, that though he could not depart from what he had ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared touching the Succeſſion, Yet to remove all Reaſonable fears that might ariſe from a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Succeſſor; if means could be found that in ſuch a Caſe the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Government might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Hands, he was ready to hearken to any expedient for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eſtabliſh'd Religion without the Deſtruction of Monarchy.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding all which, no expedient could be found, but that of a Total Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which he was ſo nearly concern'd in Honour, Juſtice and Conſcience not to Conſent to. Nor did he believe, as he had Reaſon ſo to do, but that if he had in the laſt Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> conſented to a Bill of Excluſion; that the Intent was not to have reſted there, but to have attempted ſome other great and important Changes.</p>
                  <p>That the buſineſs of <hi>Fits-Harris,</hi> impeach'd by the Commons of High Treaſon, and by the Lords referred to the Ordinary Courſe
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:59093:129"/>
of Law, was on a ſuddain carried to that Extremity by the Votes of the Houſe of Commons, <hi>March</hi> 26. That there was no poſſibility left of a Reconciliation.</p>
                  <p>Whereby an impeachment was made uſe of, to delay a Tryal directed againſt a profeſſed <hi>Papiſt,</hi> charg'd with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of an extraordinary Nature.</p>
                  <p>That nevertheleſs he was reſolv'd that no Irregularities in Parliaments ſhould make him out of love with them, but by the Bleſſing of God to have frequent Parliaments, and both in and out of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to uſe all his utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to extirpate Popery, and to redreſs the Grievances of his good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and in all things to Govern ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Laws of the Kingdom. This Declaration being publiſhed, was likewiſe ordered to be read in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Chapples thoroughout the Kingdom. And thus my dear Friend <hi>Fame</hi> (for thou art ſome times a Friend to me as well as to Falſhood) I have been Candid toward thee, in giving Thee plainly without Comment or Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions either on the one ſide or the other, a true Accompt of the most Memorable paſſages of the Two laſt Parliaments, in
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59093:130"/>
due Series and Connexion for the aid and aſſiſtance of thy Memory. Now take thy flight, and make the beſt Uſe of thy Pacquet which thou canſt. If thou ſeek'ſt for more, go look among the Intelligences; which though they will deceive Thee: may perhaps better tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle the Fancies then the Judgments of the People.</p>
