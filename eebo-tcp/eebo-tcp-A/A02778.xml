         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that is not able to mainteine the ende
thereof to be partly diuine, and common

ende, is the glorie of God; the humane,

by ſuch predictions, and diuinations, as
the principles and rules of this Art truly

<pb facs="tcp:16124:6"/>

of the priuate exerciſe, as to the
aduenturing of the publique Dedication
vnder the names of ſo graue, and ſo well

that not only the right worſhipful eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and account of your name, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
Commonwelth vertues (which
<pb facs="tcp:16124:7"/>

here in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> where my moſt abode
ſince <hi>Michaeſmas</hi> laſt, vpon ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

vnto your good worſhip, but
alſo certaine other reſpectes, no leſſe effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall.
If I had been ignorant before, yet
ſince my late continuaunce here, I coulde
not but learne how ſingular account you
make of all good learning, what eſpeciall
great fauour you extend towards the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and learned; and laſtly, how ready
and deſirous you are to defend and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
both the one and the other, eyther
by priuate, or publicke patronage. Which
very affection of yours, ſo euidently decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by ſo many actuall ſignifications ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
might of it ſelfe, without farther rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſufficiently encourage me vnto this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.
But I cannot forgette my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Gabriels</hi> report of the bountifull and
courteous entertainment which it pleaſed
you aboue three yeeres ſince to geue vnto
him, and the Oxforde Preacher, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
at that time, being both but ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
vnto you. Which entertainment I
heard him both then, and ſince, much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende,
as well for your worſhipfull and
<pb facs="tcp:16124:8"/>
rare courteſie, extended towardes them,
partly by familiar diſcourſe vpon ſome
chiefe pointes of learning, and partly by
manifeſt declaration of your good liking,
&amp; welwiſhing otherwiſe, as for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the cheare, choiſe of the companie,
manner of welcome, and ſuch like. Which
he ſaide could not chooſe but proceede of
a liberall, and worſhipfull minde, of the
wiſer, and learneder ſort: as no doubt it
did. Beſide this, I haue lately heard it
credibly reported here in Walden, that
your good worſhippe ſhould like very wel,
and commend of my brother <hi>Richards</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologicall
Diſcourſe, with farther men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not only of my brother <hi>Gabriel,</hi> to his
eſpeciall commendation and credit, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
of my poore ſelfe too. All which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and reaſons concurring, as they doo,
how much were I to be blamed, if I
ſhould make any other choiſe for this my
firſt Dedication, then of your good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe?
To whom my onely ſuite, and
humble requeſt is, that it may pleaſe you
to accept fauourablie of ſo ſmal a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
of my duetifull good will, and heartie
affection, vntill God ſhall enhable me to
make ſome reaſonable amends with ſome
other of greater ſhewe, and more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Which I truſt wil not be long, if my

what Planets are ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſituated in the prefixed
figure of the Heauens: as
alſo what Planets are fée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and weak in the ſame.
Now it followeth that wée lykewiſe conferre
them amongſt themſelues, accordinge to the
true and exact number of their <hi>Fortitudes</hi> &amp;
<hi>Debilities,</hi> that it may yet more manifeſtly
and ſenſibly appear which of them are moſt
ſtronge and fortunate, and which againe moſt
weake and infortunate, and how one as it
were lineally ſuccéedeth another in ſtrength
and power.</p>
               <p>Firſt the amiable Planet <hi>Venus</hi> amongſt
all the other Planets is ſimply moſt ſtronge
and fortunate in the former celeſtiall ſcheme:
For if the number of her debilities be ſubtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the ſumme of her fortitudes, there
till remayne 13. teſtimonies of ſtrength,
which no other Planet obtayneth in this Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.
Notwithſtandinge ſhée is ſomewhat
weakened by certaine other accidentall <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16124:16"/>
then are yet named: for ſhe is aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
with the <hi>Dragons tayle,</hi> which as
<hi>Guido Bonatus</hi> well teſtifieth, <hi>Cum bonis

not paſſing two houres before ſhe was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite

<hi>in quarta coeli maſculina, ſuper ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram

contrarie to her owne proper nature. And
laſtly, <hi>Septentrionalis Aſcendens,</hi> which do
all ſomewhat aſſuage and abate her courage:
wherefore her ſignifications can not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither
ſo fortunate and effectual, as otherwiſe
they might, and would haue béen.</p>
               <p>2 Then the two ſuperior Planets conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Saturne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſuccéeds, which are
both very ſtrong and valerous in compariſon
of their debilities, becauſe their fortitudes
are not only equiualent: but euen as many
mo in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber as their debilities. For <hi>Saturns</hi>
teſtimonies of ſtrength are 18. his debilities
but 9. So likewiſe are the fortitudes of <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
18. his debilities but 9. Wherefore <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi>
and <hi>Iupiter</hi> ſéeme equally matched in
power and ſtrength: but in reſpect of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
I take <hi>Iupiter</hi> to be the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of both, which being generallie taken, is a
good and laudable token, but particularlie
diſcuſſed, not ſo good; as ſhall more plainly be
declared hereafter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16124:16"/>
3 <hi>Mercurie</hi> is next in ſtrength, although
in verie déed his ſtrength be rather weaknes,
then ſtrength, and little or nothing at all to
ſpeake of. For albeit his vertues are more
in number by two, then his debilities, yet he
is not ſo much exalted by thoſe two teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
as he is depreſſed by his Aſcenſion in
<hi>Meridiem,</hi> by béeing, <hi>in ſigno mali plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae,
&amp; in cadenti loco caeli,</hi> which on the
contrarie ſide, doo much increaſe his euill
influence, and make him more infortunate.
<hi>Nam ſicut ſignum turbat Domum, ita Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
turbat ſignum, &amp; ſignum Planetam.</hi>
An approued rule.</p>
               <p>4 Now as concerning <hi>Mars, Sol,</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
they are very weake and infortunate in
the prefixed ſcheme, but eſpecially <hi>Sol:</hi> For
whereas the debilities of <hi>Luna</hi> are but a ſewe
moe, and the debilities of <hi>Mars</hi> ſcarſe halfe ſo
many mo as his fortitudes: the detrimentes
of the <hi>Sun</hi> are in number full as many mo as

greatly increaſe and augment the ſtraunge
euents threatned by this corporall coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

               <p>5 Finally, <hi>Pars Fortunae,</hi> that is, the

And yet I graunt the Phiſitian may euen

the Lordly dominion of cruell <hi>Saturne</hi> ouer

but ſo that I will auoyd to repeate
any iudgement already ſet downe by my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and debilities of the princely Plannets,
<hi>Sol,</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> are at the beginning of this

Wherefore (to cut off al ſuch <hi>Tantologies</hi>) I
<pb facs="tcp:16124:25"/>
not be ſo tedious, or forgetfull of all good <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode,</hi>
as to rehearſe the ſame againe in this

mo in number the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their dignities, I am by the
way to conclude (as I did before) that they are
very vnfortunately appointed in the preſent
ſcheme: and conſequently, that many miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes,

               <p>Item, <hi>Iupiter,</hi> Lord of the Weſt Angle,

extreame ſorrow, with much perrill &amp; danger

much ſhrewde diſſention and hatred betwixt

writing thus: <hi>Scito quod oppoſitio Saturni

&amp; deteriores, ac maligniores ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationes
demonſtrat.</hi> Beſide theſe, <hi>Guido
Bonatus</hi> in the 13. chapter of his ſeconde

he determineth flatly, that <hi>Oppoſitio eſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectus
vltimatae inimicitiae, vltimatae ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciae,
&amp; vltimatae diſcordiae;</hi> his reaſon is,
<hi>Quia trahitur â Saturno, &amp; â Luminari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus;

concerning this preſent <hi>oppoſition,</hi> it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
extraordinarily malicious, and extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pernicious, in that they are moſt vnhappily
affected, &amp; afflicted, <hi>in caſibus, &amp; detrimentis

ouer true. But becauſe I purpoſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,
if God ſpare me life, to diſcourſe more at

this one reſolute &amp; peremptory iudgement of
the great Aſtrologer, <hi>Cyprian de Bohemia;
Coniunctiones, oppoſitiones, vel eclypſes,
in Virg. &amp; Capr. quod in his ſignis Iupiter
religionis Iudex magnopere debilitetur,
mutationes in religione, ſacroue ordine</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:16124:33"/>
denunciant. Wherfore I will nowe returne
againe to the preſent <hi>Coniunction,</hi> from
which I haue a little digreſſed. The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of wheſe effects beeing expreſlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
it followeth, that we likewiſe expreſly
determine, <hi>de ſubiectis locis,</hi> in what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
and Cities they ſhall eſpecially worke,
and moſt effectually ſhewe them ſelues. For
<hi>Ptolomey</hi> ſaith, <hi>Vnuſquiſque locus habet
ſuum ſignum &amp; Planetam proprium.</hi> And
that in reſpect of ſome other Aſtrologicall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
is the reaſon, as <hi>Ganiuetus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
that the plague, or any other noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and notorious calamitie happeneth in
ſome one particuler towne or citie, rather
then in another, they beeing both ſituated in

I addreſſed my preface

ſupplied ſuch Additions, as
I thought requiſite to bee
annexed to my brother <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards</hi>
Aſtrologicall Diſcourſe, I am here in

ſame, as wel to your iudgement for reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as to the Cenſure of our learnedſt Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logers,
for allowance or diſalowance. The
only fauour I require at their handes, is this,
that they would iudge as they finde, without
any ſpice of parciality, which oftentimes cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth,
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſoundeſt iudgements other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
I would be loath to attribute, or arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate

I am bold to trouble you a ittle longer,
with a note or two, concerning them. As for
the French diſcourſe, I can ſay the leſſe for
my ſmall ſkil in French, yet thus farre dare I
preſume vpon the very Title, or Inſcription,
thereof, that <hi>Docteur Francois Liberati de

<hi>le 2, Iour de May,</hi> for the time of the <hi>Grand

following the moſt perfect <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy,</hi>

&amp; <hi>Meſtlinus</hi> difference. Marry he promiſeth to
make an amends, in his <hi>Ephemerides,</hi> and
diſcourſe of the reformation of the yeere, and
of the <hi>Paſque:</hi> which I may hap expect a good
while yet, if he hold the right veyne of ſome
<hi>Italians.</hi> In the meane while, ſee how his laſt
iudgement iumpeth with ours, for the courſe
and ſtate of the yeere preſent, <hi>Et finablement

nous ſommes menazes, &amp; nous enuoye la

preſently to note touching the contents of that
French diſcourſe. Now as for old <hi>Tanners
Prognoſtical iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> who intituleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
a ſtudent in <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and <hi>Coſmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>
he were the rather to be borne withall, if
his ignorance and ſimplicitie, ſauoured not ſo
much of ſelfe lyking. I cannot but maruaile,
that hauing ſeene the other Diſcourſe, he was
not aſhamed to put foorth his: wherin his
only labor in a manner is, to ſet downe his
ſchemes in letters, being before deſcrybed in
Figures. For what is all the reſt, but a min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
mangle of ſtealths, and patcheries out of
<hi>Leouitius, Rogers ſecond comming of
Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>French Almanack,</hi> and my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> out of which, hee hath
more then once, or twiſe culled out whole
ſides <hi>verbatim,</hi> without any mention of
him, together with certaine iudgementes
of <hi>Stadius,</hi> applyed without all iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in referring the ſame to no other <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian,</hi>
then that, which the ſaid <hi>Stadius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
in his calculation for the <hi>latitude</hi> of
<hi>Anwerpe.</hi> And alas, what other iudgements
<pb facs="tcp:16124:40"/>
are in that ſily Pamphlet, whereof it ſhould
beare the name of <hi>A Prognoſticall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
Truly were it not, that his pretended
deſire and zeale to doo good, may ſeeme ſome
way to excuſe him, the ſimple old ſtudent in
<hi>Aſtrology,</hi> and <hi>Coſmography,</hi> were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to be handled for his ſimple young la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
then I will here ſpeake of. Which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
I write not ſo much to diſgrace
him, or to credite my ſelfe, as to aduiſe the
diſcret Reader not to ſuffer him ſelfe to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
by any ſuche gloſes of good intention,
but to ſuſpend his iudgement vpon triall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he reſolue vpon truſt. The olde fellowe
may perhaps beare him ſelfe vpon his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
as it is ſaid he chéefly doth: but as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
can do little without reaſonable good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
ſo experience cannot do very muche
without reaſonable good reading: which to ſay
troth, ſeemeth to be farre from this wofull
Prognoſticall Iudge. And that which is
moſte of all, he concealeth their names, to
whom he is moſt beholding: and publiſheth
that for his owne, which God wot he hath
litle right or title vnto. You know who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
<hi>Ingenui Animi eſt, profiteri per
quos profeceris:</hi> and may not my brother
ſay to this olde <hi>Coſmographer,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi>
doth in one place? <hi>Tu, qui a Naeuio vel ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſiſti

But God, and the world forgiue him, as
we do: and let both him and all other account
of vs no otherwiſe, then they find vs in very
déed: which I am ſure is your chiefe deſire.
I might eaſily enlarge this <hi>Epiloge</hi> with
interlacing of other matters: and namely
