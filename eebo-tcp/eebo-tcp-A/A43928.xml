         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

CHARLES
EARL OF
<hi>Dorſet</hi> and <hi>Middleſex,</hi>
One of the Lords Juſtices for
the Adminiſtration of the
Government, during the
King's Abſence. Knight
of the Moſt Noble Order

            <p>THE Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi>
who travell'd ſo much, and
ſpoke ſo many Languages, being
now the Subject of this preſent Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
implores your Lordſhip's
<pb facs="tcp:54799:3"/>
Protection, having but newly learn'd
to ſpeak <hi>Engliſh:</hi> She comes not
now as formerly, in the Pomp and
Splendor of a Crown, but to render
an Account of her Actions, which
in her Life-time, made ſo mighty a
noiſe in the World; and which, tho'
they cannot be called altogether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
are yet very diverting, and
will, I queſtion not, afford a great
deal of Pleaſure and Delight to the
Reader; there being no Tragedy
in her whole Life, except that of
the Murder of the Marquis <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naldeſchi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She always maintain'd the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of a Queen, both in her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Character, to the higheſt
Degree; and her Wit and Parts
were ſo very extraordinary, that
<pb facs="tcp:54799:3"/>
they raiſed the Admiration of all.
Her Inclinations were nice and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and her Paſſions ſtrong and
violent; but the Vanity and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
of her Temper, would not
ſuffer them to endure long; and
ſhe had none of any Continuance,
except that which ſhe had for Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry,
which laſted even to her
dying Day. The great Opinion ſhe
had conceived of her own Abilities
in all things, did very much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the Cheat, ſhe put upon
her ſelf in this Affair, and caus'd
her to be led by thoſe wandring Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentators,
who being deceiv'd
themſelves, make no ſcruple to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
others. The Author has
handled them very ſeverely, and
ſome of them no leſs than they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb facs="tcp:54799:4"/>
and eſpecially ſuch as thoſe,
the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> generally
met with.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, as ſhe was a Princeſs
of a wonderful mixture, and ſtrange
variety, there is ſomething to be
found in every turn of her Actions,
ſo great and ſurprizing, that there
needs more than a common Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
to make a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning her. She cannot
therefore be recommended to a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Hand than your Lordſhip's, not
only in regard of the Greatneſs of
your Deſcent and Original, but of
your Candor, and good Humour,
together with the Excellency of your
Parts, and that Exactneſs of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for which you are ſo juſtly
celebrated.</p>

The Author of this Hiſtory,
ſpends a great deal of time, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
the Perſons that compos'd
her Court, and their Adventures
are ſo interwoven with the Queens
Affairs, that he could not avoid
it; but both the Characters, and
Adventures are ſo pleaſant, that
they make a ſufficient Recompence;
and indeed the Hiſtory would not
have been compleat without it. They
are fill'd up with a great number
of Delightful Intrigues, and odd
Circumſtances, and most of the
Accidents are ſo entertaining, that
I perſwade my ſelf that your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
who is ſo Communicative
and Generous upon all Occaſions,
will permit me to make uſe of ſo
great a Name, to recommend this

            <p>A <hi>French Abbot,</hi> of great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
and Underſtanding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
from <hi>Rome,</hi> with the <hi>French</hi>
Cardinals, from the Election of
<hi>Innocent</hi> XII. ſhewed me ſome cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Manuſcripts, which he had
obtain'd during his ſtay in <hi>Italy;</hi>
and among others, this of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
and Gallantries, of <hi>Chriſtina</hi>
Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and her Court,
while ſhe ſtaid at <hi>Rome.</hi> I preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
became of his Opinion, and
judg'd them worthy of the Preſs,
believing it would be a pleaſure to
the Publick, to communicate the
particular Circumſtances of the
<pb facs="tcp:54799:7"/>
Life of this incomparable Queen,
which none till this preſent time
have had any knowledge of. If
this Work be received well, as I
hope it will, I will afterward Print
the Maxims and Sentences of this
Queen, which have the force and
Spirit of thoſe of the Duke <hi>de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chefoucaults,</hi>
as alſo the <hi>Conclaves</hi> of
the laſt <hi>Popes,</hi> differing very much
from thoſe already Printed, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
curious <hi>Munuſcripts</hi> which do
well deſerve to appear in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
            <p>Though I have not ſeen this
Work, but in the <hi>French</hi> Language,
yet the Gentleman who gave it me,
aſſures me, that the Original was
<hi>Italian,</hi> and found among other
Papers of the Author, who died at
<hi>Rome,</hi> a little before the Abbot who
brought it, came from thence. One
may eaſily ſee that it is nothing but
a Tranſlation, by many Words an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
improper Phraſes, which are not
<pb facs="tcp:54799:7"/>
               <hi>French;</hi> but I hope the Reader, will
have the Goodneſs to excuſe it, and
content himſelf with the Truth,
ſeeing he may be ſure to find it
here, without the leaſt Diſguiſe or
Deceit. More time will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
to finiſh the other <hi>Manuſcripts</hi>
which are preparing, and will be
publiſhed quickly after this Work;
whoſe Author was one of Queen
<hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Officers, and of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Eſteem and Credit with her, to
have had a ſhare in her Secrets. It
will be ſeen clearly enough in the
reading of the Hiſtory, though he
endeavours to perſuade us, that he
was never in her Service. Flattery
has no part in his Writing, as may
be found by his Complaints againſt
Cardinal <hi>Azzolini,</hi> and oftentimes
againſt the Queen her ſelf, who
committed all to his Eminence,
without leaving any thing, for her
Domeſticks to do. And it may be
ſeen, that the Affection, which he
<pb facs="tcp:54799:8"/>
has for his Miſtreſs, makes him
often ſpare her, without revealing
all thoſe ill things, which he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well knew; and could eaſily
have given an Account of.</p>

               <hi>ROME</hi> which is the Centre of

<hi>Chriſtina</hi> behave her ſelf with ſo agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Demeanor, that I believe it will
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54799:9"/>
very much contribute to the Diverſion
of the Publick, without ſhocking the
Majeſty ſhe always upheld, if I give an
<hi>Idea</hi> or Deſcription of her particular
Actions, and to her Heroick ones, add
certain little Enjoyments, which are
not to be accounted altogether ill, in a
Perſon who had quitted a Throne for a
private Life, that ſhe might give her
ſelf a little more liberty. The Great
Ones have their Frailties as well
as the leſs; and when we conſider them
only, in the Splendor wherewith they are
ſurrounded, Vice paſſes oftentimes for
Vertue: But when we bring them to a
narrower Examination, we ſhall eaſily
diſcover thoſe great Paſſions, which
make them ſet all their Engines at work
to ſatisfie them. Hiſtory which flatters
not, renders Juſtice to all, becauſe ſhe
ſpeaks nothing but what Truth ſuggeſts.
'Tis Truth which brings all things to
Light, and without it we know nothing
certain. She appears in all her Simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
in the Hiſtory of the retired Life
of <hi>Chriſtina Alexandra,</hi> Queen of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals.</hi> There

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54799:9"/>
who in her publick one demonſtrated ſo
much Greatneſs of Soul. Her Hiſtory
is writ by too many Authors of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Nations and Languages to make
mention of in this place. They all
agree in Matters of Fact, and we may
follow them without any ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ruple. But
ſeeing they have ſpoke nothing of the
ſecret Intrigues of this Princeſs, known
only to her Domeſticks, we que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
not but that it will oblige the
Publick to communicate theſe Memoirs;
and we ſhall here find that Princes do
eaſily impoſe upon us, and what is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
attributed to Policy, is yet
nothing elſe but the Effect of irregular
Paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſtina Alexandra</hi> has perhaps been
the Princeſs, who has moſt of all impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

all Mankind. Her Wit cauſed Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

her Face, which cauſed Love in all that

People from reflecting upon the real
Defects of her Perſon. She was a little

was middle-ſized, inclining to be fat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>;
and yet ſhe was at a reaſonable ſtand as
to that Point: Her Complexion was the
fineſt in the World: Her Eyes were
beautiful and ſparkling; her Lips red;
ſhe had good Teeth, and an Aquiline
Noſe; her Neck and Hands white, tho'
ſhe never waſh'd them in any thing but
cold Water. Beſides theſe Excellencies
of her Sex, which made her a Beauty in
her own Nature, ſhe had ſome of the
beſt Qualities of ours, ſuch as Courage
and Undauntedneſs, with an admirable
knowledge of moſt things; a great dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity
in the Conduct of the weightieſt
Affairs, as alſo of the moſt curious. And in
a word, ſhe had almoſt all the choiceſt
Qualifications of both Sexes. The
greatneſs of her Wilt, the facility of
her Genius, the exactneſs of her Thoughts,
the delicacy of her Expreſſions, and laſt
of all a prodigious Memory, which made
things paſt appear as preſent: All theſe
rare Talents ſhould I ſay, or rather all
theſe extraordinary Qualities did ſo
aſtoniſh all that approach'd her, that
they were not capable of attending any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54799:10"/>
other thing. And yet thoſe who would
not ſuffer themſelves to be ſo eaſily
led away without a nicer Inſpection,
could find conſiderable Faults in her,
how great and tranſcendent ſoever her
Wit were. She ſo much loved her Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
that ſhe obſerved no Meaſures in
the taking of it, and would Debaſe
her ſelf ſo far as to be Familiar with
many of her Officers. Her Domeſticks,
who would take all ſorts of Liberty
with both Sexes, were ſometimes Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of their own, and her greateſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites
have oftentimes found her
Light, Inconſtant, Contradictory, and
always full of her ſelf; things ſcarce
Supportable even in Princes themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Greatneſs of this Princeſs's Soul

Surpriz'd at it, but no one could tell

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad read, that ſome Princes who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54799:11"/>
had been Crown'd with Glory, but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ired with the noiſe of Arms, and
the trouble of Royalty, choſe to retreat
towards the end of their Lives, into
places ſeparate from the Commerce of
Mankind, to live a more eaſie and quiet
Life. But this Example was not the
motive of her Retirement; for ſhe was
then in the flower of her Age, and had
ſcarce taſted the Pleaſure of Reigning:
Nor was it want of Succeſs, which
has often been the cauſe of the precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Retreat of Princes, fearing to tarniſh
the glory of their former Actions, by
the ſhame of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>atter. For Fortune
had ſmiled upon our Queen even till
that preſent time. Her People were
Victorious over their Enemies. She was
the Refuge of the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi>
and indeed every thing conſpir'd to
make her Fear'd of the one, and Eſteem'd
by the other. Notwithſtanding all this,
ſhe took the Reſolution of quitting
<hi>Sweden,</hi> and advancing the Prince Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> who was next Heir
to the Throne. Her Subjects oppos'd
themſelves, and repreſented the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Effects of it; and redoubled the
Eſteem and Reſpect which they always
had for her Majeſty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54799:11"/>
It was noiſed in the World, That
ſhe being diſguſted with the <hi>Lutheran</hi>
Religion, had a deſign to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of the <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> which
was not agreeable to the Laws of the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
and that ſhe had rather follow the
motives of her Conſcience, than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
her Crown. For my part, I
ſhould believe with others, that this
was the true motive of her Abdication,
if ſhe had not afterwards given the
Lie to thoſe great things ſhe at firſt
had done for God's ſake. But being
throughly inform'd in all her Secret
Intrigues, I believe that Love, which
very often aſcends the Throne with
Princes, was the cauſe which made
Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> Deſcend. She Loved
Count <hi>Magnus</hi> of <hi>Gardia</hi> ſo deſperately,
who durſt not anſwer her Paſſion, that
whereas Kings elſewhere make Queens
by Marriage, ſhe endeavour'd to make
a King on the ſame manner. But not
being able to bring the Eſtates of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
to Conſent to this, ſhe took ſo great
a deſpite at it, that ſhe reſolv'd to live
for the future in a Melancholy Single
State However, ſhe had neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
nor diſpoſition to paſs the reſt
of her days in Retirement, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54799:12"/>
as ſhe ſaid, that Vertue did
not conſiſt in being Severe or Rough;
nor in retiring from Humane Society,
to ſeek God in the Horrour of Solitude;
And that it was the way to draw and
collect a Man to himſelf, rather than
to Unite him to God. Adding, That
ſince there was innocent Diverſion to
be had in Society, and that Pleaſures
were permitted to the World, one
might find God among Men without
refuſing them. So that acting upon
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>his fine Principle, ſhe took a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to quit the troubleſome buſineſs of
a Crown, that ſhe might give her ſelf
up the more entirely to her own Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
But withal thinking to improve
her Wit by enlightning her Reaſon, ſhe
intended to Travel all over <hi>Europe,</hi> for
Rules to perfect her Manners, to be
built upon the different Maxims of
thoſe People among whom ſhe came.
All this (joyn'd with the Secret of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
her ſelf univerſally talk'd of)
was the reaſon of calling in Prince
<hi>Carolus Guſtavus</hi> to Reign in her place.
However, ſhe reſerved to her ſelf the
Revenue of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and other Eſtates
of the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi>
Thus ſhe renounc'd her Royal Dignity,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54799:12"/>
at 27 Years of Age, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1654.
and a little after left <hi>Sweden,</hi> going into
<hi>Germany,</hi> which ſhe travers'd almoſt
throughout, and when ſhe came to <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck,</hi>
abjur'd her Religion: After which,
ſhen went into <hi>Italy,</hi> in the Year 1655.
You may eaſily imagne, that ſhe was
every where receiv'd with the Honours
due to her Quality, without being at
the trouble of a particular Recitation.
We would willingly have related what
paſs'd in her Voyages, if there had been
any thiny that would have ſtirr'd up
the Curioſity of the Reader, but ſhe
muſh have made a longer ſtay in all
Cities, to have enter'd upon Intrigues,
and therefore this was reſerv'd for
<hi>Rome,</hi> where ſhe would be more Eaſie.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the VIIth, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
himſelf great Matters from a
Queen who was become a new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert,
gave order to receive and treat
her Royally through all the Teritories
of the Eccleſiaſtical State, and himſelf
gave order for her entry into <hi>Rome;</hi>
which came very near to the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of the Triumphs of the Ancient
<hi>Romans;</hi> but whether it were that ſhe
could not find what ſhe ſought at <hi>Rome,</hi>
or whether her Inconſtancy would not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54799:13"/>
ſuffer her to ſtay there for any long
time, ſhe departed for <hi>France</hi> in the
Year 1657. From whence ſhe hoped
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ind an eaſie Paſſage for <hi>Engiand.</hi>
But <hi>Cromwell</hi> believing it to be done
out of Policy, and his Affairs being in
a Staggering condition, refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
into his new Eſtates, ſo unquiet
and turbulent a Spirit as was that of
the Queen of <hi>Sweden.</hi> However ſhe had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound in <hi>France</hi> wherewith to ſatisfie
her ſelf for the ſhameful refuſal ſhe had
met with in <hi>England,</hi> if ſhe had known
how to manage it; for the King, as
buſie as he was, to make an end of a
Civil War, which had almoſt ruin'd
his Kingdom, omitted nothing that might
render <hi>France</hi> agreeable to the Queen.
And all the Princes after his Example,
crowded to Viſit a Princeſs who had
obtain'd ſo great a Reputation among
among all Nations. The Men of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
alſo made their Court, as well as
the Perſons of Quality, and both the
one and the other always departed well
Satisfied in the Witty and Learned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
they had with her. There
was preſently ſome Talk of her Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
with certain Princes, whom ſhe
had inſpired with Love; but theſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54799:13"/>
Amours were only flying Gallantries,
and there was none but the Duke of
<hi>Guiſe</hi> that had any Engagements with
her for any conſiderable length of time.</p>
            <p>This Prince who was as knowing
and dextrous in Courtly Qualifications,
as skilful in Arms, was choſe by
the King to go and receive her upon
the Frontiers of <hi>France.</hi> He ſhewed in
his Voyage that he had loſt nothing of
his good Mein in the Revolution of
<hi>Naples,</hi> and that the Edge of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were not quite taken off by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Segovia;</hi> for he knew ſo well
how to turn all things to his own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
that he quickly entred into the
Queen's good Graces. She was her ſelf
too well skill'd in Gallantry, not to ſee
the Duke's Paſſion through all his Cares,
and the great Honours he cauſed to be
paid her in all places where ſhe paſs'd.
The particular Diſtinction which ſhe
made of this Prince, did confirm that
it was not reported without a probable
appearance, that an Intrigue was form'd
in this Voyage. On the other hand, the
coldneſs which the Queen ſhew'd to her
grand Uſher, whom ſhe had formerly
Lov'd, augmented the Suſpicion, and made
her Domeſticks believe that the Duke
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54799:14"/>
had inſenſibly baniſh'd the Love of the
Marqueſs <hi>Monaldeſchi</hi> out of the Queen's
Heart. They were deceiv'd in theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures,
as it often happens to thoſe who
judge of every thing, without knowing
any thing to the Bottom: For it was no
new Engagement the Queen had, which
made her neglect him, but the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet
Conduct of <hi>Monaldeſchi.</hi> This
<hi>Italian</hi> Gentleman had forgot, it ſeems,
that Policy which makes a particular
Character of the People of his Coutry.
Some Letters which the Queen had
writ to him, fell into his Enemies hands,
who ſent them into <hi>France</hi> to the Queen.
The Cardinal was accuſed of it, and
the Suſpicion perhaps was not ill foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
But however it were, the Queen
Sacrificed this once admired Love, to
the Outrage done to her Honour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any regard either to the delight ſhe
had taken in his Perſon, or the Laws of
the Realm where ſhe then was. This
lofty Princeſs believ'd, that becauſe ſhe
was a Queen, ſhe by her own Power,
might do her ſelf Juſtice upon a Perſon
who had diſcover'd her Weakneſs; and
her Reſentment was ſo great, and ſo
much to the Quick, that ſhe paſs'd over
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54799:14"/>
all Laws, in erecting a kind of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Tribunal, where he was Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
as himſelf declared to ſome, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being guilty of any other Crime,
than anſwering to the firſt Advances
that this Princeſs made to him. This
Aſſaſſination committed in the Gallery
of <hi>Harts,</hi> ſo called, in the Royal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of <hi>Fountain Bleau,</hi> ſounded ſo ill in
the World, that the Court could not but
diſapprove ſo Inhumane an Action.</p>
            <p>Our cruel Lover being come to her
ſelf, after ſhe had dipp'd her Hands in
the Blood of a Man whom ſhe was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
accuſtom'd to Careſs, ſaw that ſhe
now had loſt her ſelf in the Eſteem of
one of the moſt Splendid Courts of the
World, and was alſo conſtrained to
leave <hi>France,</hi> which was, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd,
the fineſt and moſt agreeable
part of <hi>Europe,</hi> adding, that <hi>Paris</hi> was
the Seat of Pleaſures, and the Center
of fine Wits. That the Court of <hi>France</hi>
was the moſt Magnificent in all <hi>Europe;</hi>
and that there was more Politeneſs
there, than in any other place of the
World. However, the Seaſon then, was
not at all proper for Intrigues of Love;
for although the Capital City was Free
and at Eaſe, all was yet in Confuſion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54799:15"/>
upon the Frontiers, and the Nobles
were more employ'd to follow <hi>Mars</hi>
amidſt the dangers of War, than to
proſecute the Pleaſures of <hi>Venus</hi> in the
Streets of the Ladies of <hi>Paris.</hi> Well,
ſhe went away at laſt, though with
much difficulty, which was very
happy for her, had ſhe been able by
diſtance, to extinguiſh the Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ſhe had juſtly drawn upon her
ſelf, by the violent Death of the
Marquiſs <hi>Monaldeſchi.</hi> And after all,
ſhe has not been able to hinder Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
from tranſmitting to Poſterity a
Fact which ſhould teach Youth to bridle
their Paſſions, by ſhewing them, that
this was only Love changed into Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred;
That offended Love ſets every
thing at work to Revenge it ſelf, And
that ſuch Amours do often end in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Cataſtrophe.</p>
            <p>After this, Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> took her
way towards <hi>Rome,</hi> with a deſign to
end her Days there, but the Plague,
which afflicted it, <hi>Anno</hi> 1659, kept her
along time in the City of <hi>Peſaro,</hi> and
in ſome other places of the Eccleſiaſtical
State, till this Laſh of the Almighty
being taken away, ſhe might return in
Safety to <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:54799:15"/>
Though her ſecond Entry into the
Capital City of the World, came not
near the Pomp of the firſt, it was how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
very Magnificent. A great many
of the Nobility went to meet her out
of the City, and to give her a welcom
Reception, and ſhe had the general Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
of all ſorts of People. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after ſhe came, ſhe put her
Court into good Order, taking Perſons
of the firſt Quality for Gentlemen
and Pages; but had ſo little Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
in her Houſe, and made ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
an Expence, that her Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
was not able to Maintain ſo nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
a Court. And being always in
Debt, ſhe was neceſſitated to Pawn her
Plate, as ſhe had done her Jewels, for
Money to pay off Bills. All which, the
Pope underſtanding, gave her Cardinal
<hi>Azzolini</hi> to be her Director, and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of her Houſe. This Wiſe and
Prudent Oeconomiſt, by retrenching part
of the fooliſh and unneceſſary Expences
of the Queen's Palace, put things into
Order in a little time, and by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
her Majeſty's Effects, inſtead of
being in Debt as before, he ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Matters, that ſhe had always a ready
Caſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:54799:16"/>
This wiſe and able Politician never
oppos'd himſelf to the Queen's Will, but
on the contrary, gave free conſent to
what Deſigns ſoever ſhe had. And becauſe
he knew her Fancy, made her Houſe
finer and more ſumptuous than ever,
advancing Money of his own when the
Queen's fail'd. By this means, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
ſo far into the Queen's good Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that ſhe could never ſpeak of him
without acknowledgment of his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
But the Cardinal, who had more
Contrivances in his Head than one at a
time, look'd upon the Queen as a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
deſerving to be Beloved, without
daring to declare himſelf a Lover; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſtudied to gain her altogether by
his Merit; And to make his Deſign
take better Effect, he never ſpake to
her but after he had been taking ſome
great Care, or made ſome particular
Application about her Majeſty's Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick
Affairs. The Queen, who ſtaid
ſome time for nothing but his own
Declaration to Surrender her ſelf, at
laſt prevented him, by giving him Signs
that he might be happy when he pleaſed;
and he knew well enough how to make
uſe of the occaſion, and followed her
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54799:16"/>
Inclination, and ſo they firſt embarked
in the buſineſs of an Amour.</p>
            <p>Behold here what ill Will has made
publick concerning an Intrigue, which
had no other Witneſſes but the Parties
themſelves, pretending there are ſuch
clear Reaſons of this Diſcovery, as
will not ſuffer us to doubt the Truth of
the Matter: However thus it is, that
all the World ſpeaks about it.</p>
            <p>This Conqueſt, ſuppoſing it true,
diſſipated all the Queen's Melancholy, ſo
that laying aſide all care, ſhe entertain'd
no Thonght of any thing but her Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
and to inſpire Love into her
new Favourite. The ſpecious pretence
of Buſineſs did facilitate their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views,
ſo that they might lay their
Heads together, when they had a
mind to take their fill of Pleaſures,
without Reflection or Scandal. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
the Cardinal continued to
have a great care of the Queen's Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;
but took upon him to ſpeak
with ſuch Command, and in ſo lofty a
manner to the other Officers, that they
concluded he was authoriz'd by the
Queen to do it; and looking more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
into the Reaſon of this, they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54799:17"/>
found him to be as well the true Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,
as the Intendant of the Queen.
And it was ſo managed by him, that no
body durſt ſpeak of this Familiarity
with her. But what the Domeſticks
durſt not ſay then, Monſieur <hi>Coulange</hi>
afterwards expreſs'd in this Song.
<q>
                  <l>But her dear <hi>Azzolini</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>So charm'd her with Delight,</l>
                  <l>From him ſhe could not live a Day,</l>
                  <l>Nor paſs a tedious Night.</l>
               </q>
In theſe few Words Monſieur <hi>Coulange</hi> has
expreſs'd very much, and withal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
the Intrigue of the Cardinal
with the Queen: But he ſays nothing of
the Cardinal's Character; which we
muſt take in the Portraicture that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Decio Azzolini,</hi> was born at
<hi>Fermo</hi> an Archiepiſcopal See in the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
Anconitana, Anno</hi> 1623. He was a
handſome Perſon, tall, and well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd,
had black Hair, lively and
ſparkling Eyes; but his Noſe was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſhort, and yet he might be ſaid to
have had a pleaſant and happy Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
The Qualifications of his Mind
were extraordinary; He had ſo great a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54799:17"/>
knowledge in all good Literature, that
ſcarce any of his Nation could equal
him; and had a <hi>Genius</hi> more adapted
than any other to penetrate into the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
And as our Cardinal's Sphere
wherein he mov'd was very large, it
gave a large ſcope to his Mind. He had
an excellent Gaiety, Briskneſs, and
Strength of Wit, ſpake very well on all
Subjects, writ exactly, and was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in Converſation. Which Character
agreed well enough with his Years; and
though he was not altogether the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
he ſeemed to be, was yet of great
Advantage to him, to inſinuate himſelf
into the Queen's Mind. He was not
exempt from Faults; for he was of a
jealous and deceitful Temper; flexible
and patient to exceſs, when his Affairs
requir'd it; alſo covetous and biaſs'd
to his own Intereſt, but of great Ability
in the management of the moſt difficult
Matters, and in the diſcovery of the
moſt ſecret Intrigues. He ow'd his
Cardinal's Cap to his Abilities this way.
For though he was of Quality by Birth,
and that there had been a Cardinal of
his Name under <hi>Sextus</hi> V. He could not
propoſe to obtain the Purple by his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
alone; and beſides, he had taken up
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54799:18"/>
a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort of Life for a long time, which
ſeem'd to be againſt his mind: For
having gone through his Studies in
the City, where he was born, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of his Affairs obliged him to put
himſelf into the Service of ſome Prelate
of <hi>Rome.</hi> And for this purpoſe he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
the Credit of Cardinal <hi>Barbarini</hi>
Patron of the <hi>French,</hi> and the Pope's
Nephew, to whom he was recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.
He got him entred into the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Archbiſhop <hi>Pancirola,</hi> Titular
Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whom after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Pope ſent his Nuncio into <hi>Spain;
Azzolini</hi> accompanied him in this Voyage,
and perform'd the Office of Secretary,
during all the time of his Nunciature.
In this place he made it appear to his
Patron, that he was capable of being
ſomething better than a Scribe; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
from thence forward the Patriarch
conceived ſo advantageous an <hi>Idea</hi> of
him, that being promis'd to be a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
he made <hi>Azzolini</hi> his Conclaviſt,
after the Death of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the VIII.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Azzolini</hi> gave new and farther Proofs
of his Abilities in this higher Station,
inſomuch that in this Conclave, <hi>Innocent</hi>
X. being created Pope, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
after declared Cardinal <hi>Pancirola</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:54799:18"/>
his prime Miniſter, in the room of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Pamphilio</hi> his Nephew, who had
left his Hat that he might eſpouſe the
Princeſs of <hi>Roſſano. Azzolini</hi>'s Protector
being thus raiſed to the higheſt Charge
in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> did not forget a
Man whom he knew to be fit for great
Employs, and made him Secretary of
State. This new Poſt furniſhed <hi>Azzolini</hi>
with fair Occaſions of making himſelf
known, by the management of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron's
Favour: But Fortune would not
ſuffer him to enjoy it long, and the
Death of this Miniſter was enough to
have ſhaken any other beſides himſelf.
But he had the good luck to pleaſe the
Pope; and the Holy Father taking him
into his Protection, put him immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the Prelature, by declaring him
Chamberlain of Honour, and permitting
him in the Interim to exerciſe the Charge
of Secretary of State. Afterwards he was
made Secretary of the Breves of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and he acquitted himſelf ſo well
in this Office, that the Pope call'd him
his Eagle. Theſe Breves were full of
fine Thoughts, and all ſo nobly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd,
that one might take a great
pleaſure in reading them ſeveral times
over. However <hi>Azzolini</hi> did not limit
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54799:19"/>
himſelf to theſe Breves; but fearing
that his <hi>2d.</hi> Protector might fail him in
the middle of his Fortune, as the firſt
had done, he endeavoured by all Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
to advance himſelf; and, in the
end found a favourable opportunity of
doing it upon the Ruines of another.</p>
            <p>Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> X. having no Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
ſince the Marriage of Prince
<hi>Pamphilio,</hi> adopted Cardinal <hi>Caſtalli</hi> his
Favourite, and gave him all thoſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
and Offices which the Pope's Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews
uſually enjoy'd; and yet this
ungrateful Perſon ruin'd his Fortunes
by his own Fault; for not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with his Proſperity, be thought to
raiſe his Merit with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
who had given him the Protection of the
Kingdom of <hi>Sicily.</hi> And this he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
by revealing Secrets of State to them,
in prejudice of the Rights of the Holy
See, becauſe the World believ'd that
the Pope, during <hi>Maſanello</hi>'s Rebellion,
had a Mind to unite <hi>Naples</hi> to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
State. And perhaps <hi>Aſtalli</hi>
thought to come to the Sovereign Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate
by the help of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
whoſe Favour he underhand ſought by
ſuch ſhameful Methods. Now the Pope
coming to the knowledge of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54799:19"/>
very much reproved him for it,
and forbad him to ſee the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
any more. But it was to no
purpoſe, which ſo angred his Holineſs,
that he promiſed the Hat to any one
that could diſcover the Intrigue of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Aſtalli</hi> with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.
<hi>Azzolini</hi> who liv'd in the Palace,
took his Advantage of this Conjuncture,
and obſerved him very narrowly, till
he diſcovered that every night about
twelve of the Clock when the Pope was
in Bed, <hi>Aſtalli</hi> came came down from
his Apartment, in the Palace of <hi>Monteca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallo,</hi>
by a little winding pair of Stairs,
at the bottom of which there was a
Gate, leading out to a narrow Street,
through which he paſſed in diſguiſe;
and ſome paces from thence went into
an Hackney Coach, which conveyed
him to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors: There
he ſtaid two or three hours, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
back in the ſame manner. <hi>Az<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zolini</hi>
told the Pope of this, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Cardinal <hi>Aſtalli</hi> to be ſeized, as he
was thus returning one night from the
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſadors; and after he had
upbraided him with Perfidiouſneſs, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
him from being of his Family,
took from him his Employments, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54799:20"/>
expelled him his Palace. After which
he fled into <hi>Sicily,</hi> and there died of
Grief at his Biſhoprick of <hi>Catanea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Preſently after this, <hi>Azzolini</hi> appeared
at <hi>Rome</hi> cloathed in Purple, being made a
Cardinal for his having made himſelf a
Spy. His Promotion was much talked
of, and ſurpriz'd many People, and
this his Vigilancy in diſcovering In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
hath been obſerved upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other occaſions, but particularly
when he acted in his own Intereſts; for
he would then uſe all Arts imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
till he brought his Deſigns about;
and from hence it was that ſince that
time we always ſaw him make ſo great a
Figure in the Sacred Colledge. He
was Secretary of State under the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate
of <hi>Clement</hi> IX. and in the four
Conclaves wherein he was preſent, he
had a good part in the Election of the
Popes, <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. <hi>Clement</hi> IX. <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
X. and <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. being one of
the moſt eſteemed Cardinals of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
which was called the Flying Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron:
But the beſt Fortune that ever
happened to him, was, that he knew
the way ſo ſoon to obtain the good
Graces of Queen <hi>Chriſtina;</hi> which he
preſerved all his Life; and ſhe as reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54799:20"/>
kept her Word at her Death,
which ſhe had given him at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
that ſhe would make him her
Heir-General.</p>
            <p>Gallantry was not the only Buſineſs of
the Queen; for as ſhe always affected
to paſs for a great Wit, and pretended
to an Underſtanding of all things,
(though ſome have reported that ſhe
had but a ſuperficial knowledge of the
Sciences) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he kept an Academy of good
Literature in her Palace; where the
moſt learned Men in <hi>Rome</hi> came to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their Works to her Judgment:
And ſhe would liſten with Pleaſure to
the immoderate Praiſes which were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
her. Neither was Chymiſtry one
of her leaſt divertiſements: For though
ſhe were deſcended from a Throne, ſhe
had not utterly caſt aſide the Love of
Riches; and ſhe believed all her
Life, that ſhe ſhould obtain immenſe
Treaſures by means of this deceitful
Art. Count <hi>Santarini</hi> entertained her
with theſe Viſions, and cauſed her to
convert a good part of her Revenue
into Smoak. But if he ſatisfied her in
the fooliſh Paſſion which ſhe had for
Chymiſtry, he gave her alſo a great
deal of Vexation, by the Violences he
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54799:21"/>
was guilty of; for he committed an
infinite number of Diſorders in <hi>Rome,</hi>
under the Protection of her Majeſty.
Nor was he the only irregular Perſon
of her Court, for it ſeemed as if the
Queen's Officers thought they were no
way obliged to obſerve the Laws, and
that they had a permiſſion to do all
manner of Ill, and Affront all the World.
They became the Protectors of Aſſaſſines
and Thieves; and the Honour both of
Wives and Daughters ſubmitted to their
Tyranny. The Farmers of the Cuſtoms
complain'd that they could not pay
their Rent, becauſe the Merchants cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all ſorts of Goods to enter the City
by the Queen's Coaches and Livery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which hindred them from being
Viſited. Cardinal <hi>Farneſe,</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Rome,</hi> a Perſon of Integrity,
that render'd Juſtice to all, without
reſpect of Perſons, Chaſtiſed ſome of
the Queen's Domeſticks, for committing
Crimes in contempt of his Authority.
But ſhe who would play the Sovereign
in the Dominions of others, took it
heinouſly, yet could have no redreſs
herein from the Pope, who was already
tir'd with the complaints of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Diſorders. So that now he did
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54799:21"/>
not look upon her with the ſame Eye
as before, and reſolv'd to retrench the
greateſt part of the Immunities, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions,
and Priviledges he had given
her, ſeeing her Domeſticks did abuſe
them in ſo groſs a manner. And tho'
the Queen was obliged to Cardinal <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe,</hi>
who as Major <hi>Domo</hi> to the Pope,
had omitted nothing for the Queen's
good Reception, the firſt time ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<hi>Rome:</hi> ſhe notwithſtanding did what
ſhe could to give him Trouble and Vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
For this Cardinal being of the
Family of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> had the
uſe of a Houſe of Pleaſure belonging to
the ſaid Prince, which was ſcituate near
the Gate of St. <hi>Pancras,</hi> a little above
the Palace de <hi>Riarli,</hi> at <hi>Langara,</hi> which
the Queen had bought for her Life. The
Cardinal coming often thither for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Air, took a Pleaſure in Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying
the Garden; and becauſe he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Water, agreed with the Fountain-keepers
of the Apoſtolick Chamber, to
furniſh him with two Cocks of Water
from the Fountain of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> V.
which appears ſo Nobly above St. <hi>Peter
di Montozio.</hi> But at the ſame time, it

have built a Wall, but could not

however, he ſaid pleaſantly, That he
had bought the Water of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Chamber, and that if the Queen
had a mind to have more, and would

have enough to ſerve many Mills.</p>
            <p>All theſe Vexations joyn'd to the

<hi>Horatio,</hi> and his Uncles devoured more
Men for the ſake of their wealth, than any
of the moſt famous <hi>Bandits</hi> in the Kingdom

<hi>Horatio,</hi> was a proper Man of a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54799:23"/>
handſom Shape, had a large Face, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Eyes, a hook Noſe, a large Mouth
and a forked Chin; his Complexion was
pale, and his Hair of an Aſh Colour;
he was Nervous, and of a ſtrong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtution,
having his Body Hairy, his
Knees turning outward, and his Feet
inward; he had a precipitate Gate,
and nothing great or Majeſtick in
him; he was neither very Fat, nor
very Lean, a great Opiniator, and had
a Womaniſh Voice: He had the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of a good Man, but was wholly
ſteered by his own Intereſts; a Perſon
very Senſible, but more inclin'd to Ill
than Good, exceſſively addicted to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
Paſſionate in Play, and knew all
the Tricks and Cheats thereof, was a
great Diſſembler, of a Vicious Mind,
Revengeful, and very Cruel.</p>
            <p>In a little time he got ſuch an Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
over the Queen, that ſhe adher'd
to every thing he ſaid: And he ſpake
with ſo much Aſſurance, and was ſo
Poſitive, that all that heard him were
Aſtoniſh'd. As for his Religion, his
Manners ſhew'd that he had very little,
however he confeſs'd and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as others do. He knew when to
Speak, and when to be Silent; was very
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54799:24"/>
brisk among the Ladies, and ſpent much
Money upon them, but 'twas often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
at the Expence of Merchants and
Trades-men. Every thing that he could
lay hands on, was his own, whether
Sacred or Profane; and he us'd to ſay,
That he would revenge himſelf without
Threatning, for feas of being preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
He eat well, but without Exceſs,
and if any one had a Secret to excite
Luxury, he would have it, though
he dearly bought it with his Money.
Troufles, Muſhrooms, Sellery, Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choak
bottoms, and all things which ſtir
up and provoke, were for his Palate:
He drank none but the choiceſt Wines,
and after a Feaſt, would drink a glaſs
of Greek, or other ſuch ſort of Wine,
and eat two or three Comfits to help
Digeſtion.</p>
            <p>The Queen Travelled over <hi>Germany</hi>
along with him, but made no ſtay till
ſhe came to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> where ſhe Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a long time, taking ſometimes lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Journeys to <hi>Staden, Verden, Bremen,</hi>
and other Cities of the Neighbourhood
under the Dominion of the <hi>Suedes.</hi> At
laſt ſhe took a Fancy to re-enter the
Kingdom; and upon her Arrival at <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coping,</hi>
the Council of State, who had
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54799:24"/>
the Adminiſtration of all Affairs, during
the Minority of this Preſent King,
<hi>Charles</hi> the XI, Son of <hi>Charles</hi> the
X. to whom ſhe had reſign'd the
Crown, ſent to intreat her to come no
farther, for fear of giving occaſion to
ſome People of mutinous and unſettl'd
Spirits, to believe ſhe had a mind to
re-mount the Throne. But the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Senate's Meſſage was, that
they apprehended ſome danger from her
unquiet and embroyling Humour; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
they believed, that ſhe might poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
have ſome Party in the Kingdom,
and that ſhe repented her Abdication,
as <hi>Charles</hi> the V. had done. The change
of her Religion, and the Inſolence of
her People, was another reaſon why
they refus'd to permit her Entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Capital City; and eſpecially
after the Accident which happen'd to
one of her Almoners, called the Abbot
<hi>Santoni,</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> whom ſhe
had carred along with her, contrary to
the Counſel of Cardinal <hi>Azzolini,</hi> who
gave her two Prieſts of the Oratory of
the new Church, to direct her Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and to celebrate Maſs. Theſe good
Fathers were as Prudent and Regular,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54799:25"/>
as the Abbot <hi>Santoni</hi> was Irregular and
unworthy of his Character.</p>
            <p>One day he was like to have Deflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

to pay her Duty to Queen <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina</hi>
as her ancient Sovereign. But
during her ſtay in the City, <hi>Santoni</hi> got
an Acquaintance with her; and becauſe
ſhe expreſſed her Reſpects with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Freedom, which is natural to thoſe
Northern People, he thought ſhe uſed
ſome Compliance, of which he might
make his Advantage. in this Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he one day finding an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
endeavoured to force her Modeſty,
and had committed an Outrage upon
her, if ſhe had not cried out for help.
This brought in a great many People,
who laid hands on this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nfamous Perſon.
Which Action of his, gave a great Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal
to the Catholick Religion, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being uſually unjuſt enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
Generals from Particulars, as if
Faults were not Perſonal, and as if there
were not Good and Bad in all Societies.
But though the Queen did not turn him
away for this ſhameful thing, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of the Damoſel conceiving great
Indignation at ſo impudent a Villainy,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54799:25"/>
Way-laid him, with an intent to bath
their Hands in his Blood, for the Injury
he had done their Daughter; which
the Queen underſtanding, was obliged
to take him into her own Coach, to
ſhelter him from their Inſults; which
without doubt he would have received,
had it not been for this Precaution.</p>
            <p>The ſame <hi>Santoni</hi> had like to have
been Kill'd at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> for another Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.
There was a French Proteſtant,
a Merchant of <hi>Rochel,</hi> who had ſettled
himſelf, and Married a Wife in that
City, with whom <hi>Santoni</hi> having got an
Acquaintance, had the freedom of his
Houſe, and Viſited his Wiſe in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
as is uſual among Civil People,
without any ill Conſequence. Now our
<hi>Italian</hi> being born in a Country where
Jealouſie reigns, and not without cauſe,
and he not being accuſtomed to ſuch
Familiarity, hop'd that the Lady would
not be Cruel, when any handſom oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
offered, and therefore to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
her good Will, was ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
to her upon all occaſions; but one
day he had a certain Caprice which had
like to have coſt him very Dear. For
the Wife having deſired him to tell
her how ſhe might Complement her

               </gap>
he taught her ſuch Words as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Woman ought not to have in
her Mouth, if ſhe knew what they ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
But as ſhe underſtood no <hi>Italian,</hi>
ſhe innocently repeated the words ſhe
had learn'd, for he had taught her this
ſweet Leſſon ſo often, that ſhe had got
it by Heart. He did this thinking the
Merchant had not underſtood <hi>Italian,</hi>
but was miſtaken, for he had Travelled
in his Youth into <hi>Italy,</hi> and was ſo Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
to hear himſelf ſaluted with ſuch
vilainous Words, that in Paſſion, he gave
her a ſound Box on the Ear. The poor
Woman very much ſurprized at theſe
new Careſſes, fell a Weeping: But the
Merchant did not ſtop there, he would
know who taught her theſe Words. He
underſtood at laſt, though by Force and
Threatnings, that 'twas the Abbot <hi>Santo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni;</hi>
and ſhe made him ſo throughly ſenſible
of her Sincerity and Innocence, that the
good man could no longer doubt; ſo
that he turned all his Fury upon this
unworthy Prieſt, and went to ſeek him
at the Queen's Lodgings, with an intent
to Kill him; but the Rage which tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported
him, having alarmed thoſe which
he met with, they gave advice to <hi>Santoni</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:54799:26"/>
to avoid the Rencounter. How<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

               <hi>Santoni</hi> durſt come no more afterwards
to the Merchants.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>Chriſtina</hi> returned by Land from
<hi>Nicoping</hi> to <hi>Colmar,</hi> where ſhe Embark'd
for <hi>Lubeck,</hi> and from thence came into
the Dutchy of <hi>Bremen</hi> and Principality
of <hi>Verden;</hi> and as theſe Eſtates depended
on the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> they expreſſed
themſelves to her with very great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects;
ſhe was well receiv'd by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
and they preſented her their
Keys. The Burgers with all the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,
not only put themſelves in Arms,
but alſo drew out the Regular Troops,
as well Infantry as Cavalry, to give her
all the Honour they could. The Queen
was equipped in a Black Velvet Juſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>core,
having an Hat upon her Head,
adorn'd with a Plume of White Feathers,
and being Moucted like a Cavalier up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an Excellent Horſe, we rid through
their Ranks, where ſhe met with many
old Officers who had ſerv'd her in the
Army during her Regn, and ſome that
had even ſerved under the Great <hi>Guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus
Adolphus</hi> her Father. Among others,
ſhe knew General <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rangel,</hi> to whom ſhe
made a thouſand Compliments, and
would needs exerciſe the Troops in his
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54799:27"/>
Preſence. She would undertake to give
Directions for the Marches and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Marches
of the Infantry, and the
like for the Wheelings of the Horſe;
but it ſeem'd the Management of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tregue
of Love, was more ſuitable to
her, than the ordering of an Army, for
ſhe gave very improper Words of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
which made <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rangel</hi> Laugh; and
he was forc'd to aſſiſt her by fit Terms,
and to explain her Orders, that he
might not introduce new Phraſes into
the Art Military, but this could hinder
him afterwards from making pleaſant
Jeſts of her among his Friends, and
making Reflections on the Queen, as
guilty of Folly and Self-conceitedneſs.
And yet for all this, ſhe had ſo good an
Opinion of her own Merit, that ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
her ſelf perfectly Skill'd and
Knowing in all things: And when once
invited at <hi>Stade</hi> to a <hi>Wirſchaff,</hi> which
is a kind of merry Ball, ſhe appear'd
in an Antique Habit, dancing in Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade,
Cloathed like a Nymph of the
Woods, and behaved her ſelf in a moſt
Ridiculous manner.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Marquiſs <hi>del
Monte</hi> knew ſo well how to Inſinuate
himſelf into the Queen's Mind, that he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54799:27"/>
became the Arbitrator or Maſter of the
Houſe. But he was as Scandalous as
the Abbot <hi>Santoni;</hi> and it ſeem'd as if
theſe two Men had an abſolute Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to Seduce all the Women they
came near. The Queen often heard of
their Inſolencies, but when People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd,
did nothing but Laugh, or
gave ſuch gentle Reprimands, that they
took them as a permiſſion to commit
further Diſorders.</p>
            <p>The Marquiſs was not content with
his Debauchery only, but plotted and
contriv'd to commit Violence and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine;
Covetouſneſs having no leſs the
Dominion over him than other Vices.
The firſt proof of his priveledg'd Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
was to cauſe a poor <hi>Frenchman</hi> to
be Kill'd, who not knowing how to
moderate his Tongue, was the cauſe of
his own Death: His Office was a Lungs
or Bellows-blower, introduc'd to the
Queen's Service in ſavour of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Science, which her Majeſty had in ſo
great Eſteem, for ſhe hop'd by it to
recompence the giving up her Crown,
in getting the Philoſopher's Stone. And
for this purpoſe, ſhe built a Laboratory
in her Lodgings at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> where
this French Chymiſt begun his Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54799:28"/>
The Marquiſs ſeeing the Queen
was ſo eaſily perſwaded to convert a
large Sum of Money into Smoak, thought
he might do very well to ſave one half
of that Expence, and ſo keep as many
of the Gold and Silver Pieces for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
which the Chymiſt had to calcine,
as he could conveniently; ordering him
to find out an Invention to make the
the Queen believe, that the loſs of them
happened ſome other way, and for ſo
doing, aſſur'd him both of his Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and his future Kindneſs to him. This
laſted for ſome Months; but the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of her Majeſty's Houſe, required
at laſt, to know what was become of
all the Money; for the Queen who was
only made acquainted with things by
Halves, contented her ſelf with ſome
Experiments, truſting to the deceitful
Promiſes of the Chymiſt, who promis'd
her Mountains of Gold. Well then,
this Bellows-blower was obliged to
come to an Account, and his inability
to anſwer it, ſtruck him with ſuch Fear,
that he was fain to run from <hi>Hamburgh,</hi>
and fly into the Territories of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
which were very near; from
whence he wrote to the Queen, that
the Marquiſs <hi>del Monte</hi> had embezled and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54799:28"/>
miſapplied the greateſt part of the
Money. The Marquiſs being a Bold and
and Confident Man, clear'd himſelf of
this Calumny, and all the Reproach was
thrown upon the poor Chymiſt, to
whom the Marquiſs cauſed a Letter to
be written under a falſe Name, inviting
him to go to a certain Place, where he
ſhould find an Employ: The Chymiſt
went readily thither, thinking no harm,
and was there Murder'd by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs's
Orders.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Barbon</hi> now wanting this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
was obliged to find out another
way to get Money: He was called <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
by a corruption of the word, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> which is the real
Name of his Family. There was at
<hi>Hamburgh</hi> a very rich Jew, a <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
by Nation, Named <hi>Teixero,</hi> who was a
famous Merchant, and worth many
Millions: This Man having a great deal
of ready Money, was the Receiver Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the Queen's Revenue, and uſed
to advance her Money at a large Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.
The Marquiſs at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>their firſt Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
pretended himſelf his great
Friend, but with an intention ſome way
or other to ſcrew Money out of him.
This Jew had a Nephew whoſe Name
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54799:29"/>
was <hi>Abraham,</hi> a very handſom young
Man, to whom the Marquiſs preſented
a fine Horſe, on which this young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
would ſometimes Ride to a
Country Houſe belonging to his Uncle,
to take the Air, and Divert himſelf;
thither the Marquiſs would often ſend
him little Preſents, and Muſicians for
him to make Merry with his Miſtreſſes:
Which Kindneſs was continued for
ſome time, till at laſt one Night the
Marquiſs caus'd <hi>Abraham</hi> to be Seiz'd by
ſix Horſemen all Arm'd, whom they took
and lifted up at his whole length, and put
him in a great Coffer, which they boar'd
at both ends on purpoſe to give him
Air, threatning to Kill him if he cried
out or ſpoke one word, and ſo convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him into a Wood in the Country of
<hi>Brunſwick.</hi> In the mean time <hi>Teixero</hi> was
extreamly troubled that he could not
ſee his Nephew return; and after two
or three days Abſence, he ſent to his
Country-Houſe to enquire News of him;
and word was brought back, that the
young Gentleman parted from thence
the ſame day he came, with intent to
return to the City. The Uncle cauſed
great Search to be made far him every
where, and the Marquiſs <hi>del Monte</hi> was
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54799:29"/>
not a little Officious to ſerve him in it,
making ſhew as if he would rumage
every corner of the whole World to
find out his dear Friend <hi>Abraham.</hi> Now,
there was one <hi>Cleuter</hi> a Servant of the
Queen's, ſaid to be a Shoomaker's Son
of <hi>Leige,</hi> who undertook to make ſo
ſtrict and narrow a Search, that he
would not fail to bring ſome News of
him. The Queen promis'd a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Gratuity; and the Jew on his
part engaged to give a good Reward to
the Perſon that could bring back his
dear Nephew. After five days Search
(altogether at the Expence of the good
Man) Tidings were brought, that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was found in a Wood, at the
Mercy of ſix Men Maſqued, who ſaid,
They were poor Officers that wanted
Money to Re-mount their Companies;
and gave the Searchers to underſtand,
that they would not releaſe their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
at a lower Rate than Twenty
thouſand Rix Dollars; That they had
Thirty Comrades more at their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and in caſe they were forced,
they would ſooner Kill <hi>Abraham,</hi> than
releaſe him for a leſs Sum. The Jew
when he heard this ſad News, was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
almoſt to Deſpair; and the Queen
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54799:30"/>
was ſo much incenſed at it, that ſhe
would have ſent the whole <hi>Suediſh</hi>
Army into the Country of <hi>Bremen</hi> to
have deſtroyed thoſe Thieves; but Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<hi>Wrangel,</hi> who had been an old
Experienc'd Officer, and had no mind
to undertake the Exploit, could not
ſorbear Laughing, and repreſented to
her Majeſty, that theſe Troopers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Foreſt, were a pack of
Deſperate People, like ſo many furious
Wild Beaſts, and that a great many
brave Men might be loſt before they
could be able to hunt them out of the
Wood, or get any advantage of them;
and that if they ſhould kill <hi>Abraham,</hi>
his Friends would be never a whit the
better. To make ſhort the Story, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a great many Treaties and Offers,
they were at laſt forced to carry Ten
thouſand Rix Dollars, which were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
among theſe honeſt People, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Diſtribution of <hi>Barbon,</hi>
who kept the greateſt ſhare for himſelf.
<hi>Abraham</hi> returned preſently to <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
fcom whence he durſt not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
any more, for fear of ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Accident.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:54799:30"/>
Our <hi>Barbon</hi> was no leſs Gallant in
Amours, than other Intrigues. For a
<hi>French</hi> Captain of Foot in the Service
of <hi>Sueden,</hi> coming out of the Dutchy
of <hi>Bremen</hi> to <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> about ſome
Buſineſs, brought a pretty Miſtreſs
along with him, whom he call'd his Wife,
and was ſo Jealous of her, that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Cuſtom and temper of his
Country, he kept her up cloſe. But the
Marquiſs happening to ſee her, was ſo
taken with her Beauty, that he fell into
an extream longing to have an Amorous
Correſpondence with her. By the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Money he found means to ſpeak
to her, and ſend a ſmall Preſent, which
ſhe refus'd with Diſdain, and Checked
the Meſſenger very Severely for offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. But <hi>Cleuter</hi> to ſerve the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs,
went to the Captain like a Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
and after a ſhort Compliment,
told him, <hi>Captain, you have a very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Miſtreſs, ſure you will not be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
to keep her all to your ſelf.</hi> The
Captain, who was a Man of very high
Courage, being ſurpriz'd with ſo blunt
a Salute, fiercely anſwer'd, that he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
a Man of his Appearance and
Character, durſt ſpeak ſo to a Military
Man, who carried that by his Side which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54799:31"/>
would do him reaſon againſt any inſolent
Affront that ſhould be offer'd him. That
the Conſideration and Reſpect he had
for the Queen, did hinder him from
making a proper return at that Inſtant,
but that he hoped to find both a fitter
time and place to make him repent his
Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hneſs. This was great Moderation
for a Man of Courage as he was, and
who had the Principal Officers in that
City to back him, I mean the Body of
the Army, which the King Quarter'd
in <hi>Bremen, Verden,</hi> and <hi>Staden,</hi> all which
had been yielded up to him by the Peace
of <hi>Munſter;</hi> for there was a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>French</hi> among thoſe Troops. Such
of them as were then at <hi>Hamburgh</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Captain out of Humour, would
needs know the Reaſon, and having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
it, would have humbled <hi>Cleuter</hi>
after another manner. But the Captain
intending to revenge himſelf like a Man
of Honour, went firſt of all to the Quee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
who only Laugh'd at him, being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs'd
by the Marquiſs, who was the
prime cauſe of the Difference. This
Anger'd the <hi>Frenchman</hi> and made him
Chalenge <hi>Cleuter</hi> to fight him with
Sword and Piſtol. <hi>Cleuter</hi> accepted it
with difficulty, being indeed forc'd to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54799:31"/>
it for fear of paſſing for a Coward and
looſing his Reputation; but however
took Eight days to prepare himſelf. The
<hi>Frenchman</hi> generouſly and readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
and the Marquiſs in vain endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to agree the Matter during that
interval of time.</p>
            <p>The day of Combat came, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(as is uſual there) flock'd out of
<hi>Hamburgh</hi> to go and ſee it. For though
the Magiſtrates had forbidden Duels in
the City, yet they could not hinder Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from going out and fighting in the
Lands that were under the Power of
<hi>Denmark,</hi> which was but a League from
thence, at a place called <hi>Altena;</hi> near
which, ſcarce any Week paſs'd, but there
was ſome Duel or other fought, the
Cuſtom being grown ſo general, that
even among the very Tradeſmen, every
one pretended this way to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of the Injuries done him. Our two
Champions being met, went together
upon the top of a little riſing Ground,
near a Meadow, and there wheeling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
they both fired their Piſtols at
the ſame time; the <hi>Frenchman</hi>'s fail'd,
but <hi>Cleuter</hi>'s went off, and Shot his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
in the Arm, who finding himſelf
Wounded, was the more Enraged, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54799:32"/>
notwithſtanding his Wound, drew out
the other Piſtol, which alſo fail'd as the
firſt did. The <hi>Frenchman</hi> ſeeing this
immediately Diſmounted, and with
Sword in hand Attack'd <hi>Cleuter,</hi> but he,
though he ſaw ſo much Bravery, inſtead
of offering fair Quarter, fir'd his other
Piſtol, Shot him into the Belly, and Kill'd
him. After which, the Spectators ran
in and parted them; but the <hi>Frenchman</hi>
having loſt much Blood, was carried
Dead on a <hi>Bier</hi> into <hi>Hamburgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus paſſed this Combat, at which
the <hi>French</hi> were extreamly Mortified.
And it was ſaid, that <hi>Cleuter</hi> had a Charm
which hinder'd his Enemies Piſtols from
going off: But for my part, I really
believe it to be his Misfortune, for Arms
do often fail Men on that manner, of
which this is not the firſt Inſtance. At
leaſt <hi>Cleuter</hi> did not act like a Genteel
Cavalier in the Queen's Judgment, who
ought, (as ſhe her ſelf conſeſſed) to
have given good Quarter, when he ſaw
his Adverſary not in a condition of Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But he on the contrary, did not
ſhew the leaſt Compaſſion for his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
nor gave him the leaſt good
Word, but always, like a Brute, ſaid an
hundred things of the <hi>French</hi> Nation.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54799:32"/>
But one <hi>Clairet,</hi> Valet de Chambre to
the Queen, who was a Friend of the
<hi>French</hi> Captain's, was extreamly affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Grief at it, and had the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity
to aſſiſt his Widow. The Queen
alſo gave her ſomething out of Charity
towards her Maintenance. As for <hi>Cleuter,</hi>
he acquir'd the reputation of a Valiant
Perſon among thoſe of his Gang, which
made him more Inſolent than ever.</p>
            <p>At that Juncture, a <hi>Scotch</hi> Colonel
made his Court to the Queen, in hopes of
obtaining ſome conſiderable Employ by
her Credit. But as he was coming away
from her Majeſty, had ſome Difference,
I know not how, with <hi>Cleuter,</hi> and he
without many words, gave him a Wound
in the right ſide with his Sword.
The <hi>Scotchman</hi> had no time to put
himſelf upon his Defence; for <hi>Cleuter</hi>
was aſſiſted by Seven or Eight, who
kept Guard at the Gate of the Queen's
Palace, and they purſued the <hi>Scotchman</hi>
with Sword in Hand, ſo that he was
fain to fly for fear of worſe Miſchief.</p>
            <p>The Queen augmenting her Guard, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
an Accident which happen'd to her
in <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> of which we ſhall ſpeak
by and by, made <hi>Cleuter</hi> a Captain, whom
ſhe carried with her afterwards to <hi>Rome,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:54799:33"/>
and there preſented him to Pope <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
who gave him a Regiment, which
he ſent to <hi>Candia. Cleuter</hi> in that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
reaped more glorious Lawrels
than he had done in <hi>Germany.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his return, had a company of the
Pope's Guards, even to his Dying day.</p>
            <p>Although the Queen had Reform'd
one part of her Houſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> as that
of her Pages, Gentlemen, and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers,
yet for the ſake of her Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
the Salaries of the Duke of <hi>Poli</hi>
and other great Officers of her Chamber,
were conſtantly paid. Cardinal <hi>Azzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lini,</hi>
who had not been much againſt the
Queen's Journey, believing ſhe would
have moderated her Expences, and by
it have clear'd her ſelf out of Debt;
being very much ſurpriz'd to hear of
the Queen's profuſe way of Living,
could not forbear Writing to her
Majeſty, and giving her to underſtand
that he could no longer ſupport her

ſince her Departure from thence; That
he had Borrow'd what Money he was
able, and had no further Credit; And
that there was a conſiderable Sum owing
to her Domeſticks for Wages; That he

               </gap>
the Horſes, becauſe this was of very
great Expence to her there. The Queen
who wanted not a quick Apprehenſion in
other things, did not believe that the
Life ſhe led Abroad, had been ſo well
known at <hi>Rome,</hi> and upon the reading
this Letter, fell into a very great and
fearful tranſport of Paſſion. She com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd,
that ſhe had as many S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>es a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
her as ſhe had Servants; and her
Phyſician was ſuſpected to have written
an Account of his Miſtreſs's Actions to
<hi>Rome.</hi> The poor Man was ſent for into
her Preſence, and ſhe took him by the
Collar and would have Strangled him,
if he had not been Reſcued out of her
Hands; and after a Thouſand injurious
Reproaches, ſhe turn'd him out of her
Service, without giving him leave to
Juſtifie himſelf. The Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte</hi>
doubting leſt he ſhould alſo be taken to
Task, had an extraordinary Curioſity
to ſee the Letters which came from
<hi>Rome,</hi> and importun'd <hi>Laudini,</hi> a ſhe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
of the Queen's ſo much, that
ſhe ventured to take ſome of them out
of her Toilet, and others our of her
Pocket when we was in Bed. By this
means he found what he ſought for, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54799:34"/>
knew that <hi>Azzolini</hi> was inform'd of all.
From thenceforward he therefore took
all thoſe into his Intereſts who made
their Advantage of the Queen's Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance;
for indeed, almoſt every one
Pillag'd her, and was for catching at
what he could for himſelf. But her
Intendant, whoſe Name was <hi>Pezze,</hi>
whom the Cardinal had recommended
as a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>n of Integrity and great skill in
the management of Houſhold Affairs,
did very often beſeech her to look into
his Accounts, and to moderate her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences:
But ſhe always told him ſhe
would never Quarrel with him, and
that ſhe had rather truſt him than any
other, and deſir'd him not to trouble
her with his Books. This was fine
Oeconomy and excellent Order in a
Queen's Court, who pretended her ſelf
a Philoſopher, and Moraliz'd upon all
things. But for all this, the Intendant
or Steward, contrary to the uſual and
general Practice and Principles of thoſe
of his Profeſſion, was Faithful to her even
to his Death, which happened to him
not long after in a ſmall Village in <hi>Brun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
as he was returning with the
Queen for <hi>Rome.</hi> The violence of the
Convulſions, in which he Expired, did
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54799:34"/>
apparently demonſtrate that he was
Poyſon'd, and the Marquiſs was ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be the Author; though it was
nois'd Abroad at that time and Print<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d
in ſome Gazetts, that the Queen had
cauſed him to be Kill'd, which I am apt
to believe, was meer Calumuy, for ſhe
could have no Hatred againſt him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he ſerv'd her very well. Yet ſhe
never made any Enquiries into the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his Death; and after ſhe was
come back to <hi>Rome,</hi> when the Brother
of this Unhappy Perſon, came to throw
himſelf at her Feet, and to beg Juſtice
of her with Tears and Sighs, ſhe did
nothing but Laugh, and gave not ſo
much as one word of Comfort to the
poor Man.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Laudini,</hi> ſhe had been a Semp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs

The Queen being at <hi>Paris,</hi> took
her into her Service for her Talkative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and becauſe ſhe was tolerably
Handſome, and very Handy in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
ſhe did. Her Majeſty made her
one of the Women of her Chamber, and
a little after Married her to an <hi>Italian</hi>

She ſerv'd the Queen to her dying day,

ſhe would take care to Pacifie her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
And ſince the thing was done, ſhe
Pardon'd her upon the condition ſhe

            <p>Whilſt the Queen was at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi>
Monſieur <hi>Pompone,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Chevalier de

paſſing by this Place, Saluted the
Queen, who receiv'd them with great
Reſpect, according to their Quality;
and ſhe forgot not to make mention of
her Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte,</hi> to boaſt of his
Nobility and of his Honourable Name
of <hi>Bourbon.</hi> But Monſieur <hi>Pompone</hi> one
day told her very calmly, when the
Queen would have perſwaded him, the
Marquiſs was of the Family of the
Kings of <hi>France;</hi> that he had read and
examined over and over the Genealogy
of the Houſe of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> but then he
had no where found, that any Branch
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54799:36"/>
of it had ever paſs'd into <hi>Italy,</hi> except
one, unleſs the Conſtable <hi>de Bourbon,</hi>
who Commanded the Imperial Army,
which Sacked <hi>Rome</hi> in the Year 1527,
had left any Baſtards in <hi>Italy.</hi> And at

               </gap>ſieur <hi>de Terlin</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
him before the Prince of <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
with the Belying his Deſcent, by
his ſuffering ſo long the Inſolencies of
<hi>Cleuter</hi> towards the <hi>French;</hi> telling him,
that he inſtead of Reproving him, ſeem'd
rather to encourage him againſt them.
But the greateſt Mortification that ever
the Marquiſs had, was that of Madam
the Grand Marſhal <hi>Sobieski,</hi> ſince Queen,
and at this preſent, Widow of the late
King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> who paſſing by
<hi>Hamburgh,</hi> the Marquiſs was ſent to
Compliment her, and after in a Viſit ſhe
made the Queen, he would needs have
offered her ſome unbecoming Familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
though I do not well know or in
what manner it was; but he received for
it ſuch a ſevere Reprimand from that
Princeſs, and ſhe look'd upon him with
ſo much Contempt, that he had no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inclination to make the like At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
again.</p>
            <p>During her ſtay here, Pope <hi>Alexander</hi>
VII. died at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Queen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54799:37"/>
that Cardinal <hi>Farneſe</hi> might
be choſe Pope, ſhe preſently thought of
a Retreat either to <hi>Venice</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi>
believing that this Pope would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the Diſorders of her Court. But
the States of the United Provinces, who
ſome time before had oblig'd the <hi>Swedes</hi>
to reſtore to <hi>Denmark</hi> all they had taken
from that Kingdom, ſent word to the
Queen, That her Royal Character would
be ſlighted in their Republick: And at
laſt ſhe had a mind to have Settled her
ſelf in <hi>England,</hi> which was then quiet
enough, but ſhe did not like the People.
In the midſt of theſe Thoughts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
ſhe underſtood by a Letter from
Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> that Cardinal <hi>Julio Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piglioſi,</hi>
was created Pope, by the Name of
<hi>Clement</hi> IX. on the 20th of <hi>June</hi> 1667.</p>
            <p>There had been ſome Friendſhip for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
between them, and ſhe hop'd
to draw an Advantage from his Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate.
Now, therefore becauſe this was
a Subject that deſerv'd it, ſhe reſolv'd to
give a publick Teſtimony of her Joy,
notwithſtanding the Remonſtrances of
the Count <hi>de Homburg,</hi> one of the Houſe
of the Lantgraves of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> who advis'd
her againſt it, for fear the People of ſo
great a City as <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54799:37"/>
ſome Inſolence againſt Her Majeſty.
This was alſo confirm'd by one of the
Magiſtrates, but notwithſtanding all
that could be ſaid, ſhe would follow her
own Capricio, and the Counſel of the
Marquis, who always puſh'd her on to
Expences, wherein <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e always found his
Account, ſeeing all things paſs'd through
his Hands.</p>
            <p>She gave Order therefore for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
a fine Artifical Fire, and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
the Front of her Palace, where
ſhe caus'd to be painted a noble Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment
with the Pope's Arms in it,
and many curious Figures which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
his Vertues. But above it there
was diſplayed the Picture of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt
in a Cloud, ador'd by Angels, and
below was an Emblem of the Church in
a Pontifical Habit, treading Hereſie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Foot. One might eaſily have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
the Effects which ſuch a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
would produce in a Proteſtant
City, where the Exerciſe of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Religion is not publickly permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
So a great number of Seamon,
both <hi>Engliſh, Dutch</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> joyn'd
to the Populace of <hi>Hambourgh,</hi> crowded
into the Space which is before the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
being drawn together by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54799:38"/>
of the Sight. Where to increaſe
the Misfortune ſhe had made two Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of Wine, whoſe Liq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or animated
them the more to throw Stones againſt
the Decoration. Some of the Queens
Domeſticks to repreſs the Inſolence of
the People, ſhot Piſtols out at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
without Ball, but this inſtead of
diſperſing, incited them the more, and
made them redouble their Inſults, till
they within were forc'd to ſhut the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
Gates. The Windows were quickly
battered all to pieces, and many of them
would have ſet fire to the Gates with
Bundles of Straw. In this Extremity
the Queens Servants had recourſe to
four Falcons that lay in the Hall, load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them with broken pieces of Braſs
and Iron, and diſcharged them againſt
the enraged Populace, of whom they
kill'd ſome and wounded others. This
indeed made them recoil a little, but the
Blood and Cries of their wounded Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
animated them afreſh; ſo they
return'd to the Charge with an Intent
to break open the Gates and plunder the
Palace. But becauſe they had neither
Petards, nor Engines to force them, a
Score of Luſty Fellows brought a huge
long Body of a Tree, that lay at a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter's
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54799:38"/>
Door in the Street to make a
Maſt for a Ship, which they moving
backwards and forwards like the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Rams of the Antients, did many
times eſſay to break open the Gates.</p>
            <p>It was then the Queen knew, but too
late, that ſhe had done ill to follow the
Counſel which had been given her; and
the fear of falling into the Hands of this
Inſolent Mob, did ſo terrifie her, that
ſhe knew not what to reſolve on; for
the Place was no longer tenable, and
the greateſt part of her Domeſticks
were without Doors, and even the
Marquis <hi>Del Monte</hi> from whom ſhe had
it.</p>
            <p>At laſt two of the Servants took the
Queen by the Arms, and led her out at a
Back-door, which opened into another
Street, and brought her on Foot, in
Man's Apparel, to Monſieur <hi>le Chevalier
de Terlon</hi>'s Lodgings, who was then at
<hi>Hambourgh;</hi> from whence he was to paſs
into <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sueden.</hi> He liv'd in a
Quarter of the Town that was at ſome
diſtance, and the Queen being half dead
when ſhe got thither, they put her to
Bed, and preſently after brought up
Supper. When ſhe was come to her
ſelf, ſhe began to eat with a good Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54799:39"/>
and after a while falling into her
accuſtomed Rhodomontades, ſhe affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
That if they would but have let
her appear at the Windows, ſhe ſhould
have Thunderſtruck all this Rabble,
which had loſt the Reſpect that was due
to her.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Homburg</hi> being infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of this Uproar, he (accompanied
by ſome other Gentlemen of Note and
Reputation) crouding themſelves among
the Populace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> endeavour'd to appeaſe
them with fair Words, ſwearing they
themſelves would be reveng'd on thoſe
Dogs the Papiſts, that had been the
Cauſe of this Scandal; But (ſaid they)
the Queen knows nothing of all this,
and will be the firſt that ſhall Chaſtize
the Inventers, provided you commit no
further Outrage, by forcing her Palace.
But know, that if we do not make a
ſpeedy Reparation for the Injuries done
Her Majeſty, we ſhall not only draw
upon us the Arms of <hi>Sueden</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi>
but of all the Princes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
and of the <hi>Emperour</hi> himſelf, who
will ſeverely revenge it. Theſe few
Words pronounc'd with force, diſarm'd
theſe Mutineers; to which alſo the
Burghers being in Arms, did not a little
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54799:39"/>
contribute. So the Seige was rais'd,
and the next Week after the Magiſtrates
conducted the Queen to her Palace in
Triumph. And then this Princeſs was
ſo bountiful as to disburſt Two thouſand
Crowns among the Wounded, of which
two died; yet after this hot Alarm, ſhe
ſtaid not long in this City, but in a few
Days ſet forward for <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I had been a brib'd Hiſtorian, I
ſhould have extoll'd the undaunted Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
of the Queen upon this Occaſion
to the very Skies, and aſſured the
World, that the gave the utter moſt
Proofs of an Heroick Courage, but then
I ſhould have betray'd the Truth: For
it is moſt certain, that never any Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was more timerous than ſhe; tho'
when the Danger was paſs'd, ſhe play'd
the Braggadocio, and was infinitely
pleas'd when her Sycophants affirmed,
That neither <hi>Alexander</hi> nor <hi>Caeſar</hi> had
ever teſtified ſo much Bravery in the
midſt of ſo many Dangers. So true it
is, that Flattery can diſguiſe any thing,
and that Princes take a great deal of
Pleaſure in being impos'd upon that
way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:54799:40"/>
This little Accident makes me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
another which happen'd a long
while after at her Palace of <hi>Laugara</hi> in
<hi>Rome,</hi> where ſhe expreſſed every whit
as little Courage as here. There was a
Linnen Cloath put up before the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
in the Lower Court, to keep off
the violent Heat of the Sun. A little Boy
of the Neighbourhood by chance throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Squib happened to ſet it on fire.
This inconſiderable Flame did ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
her, that ſhe ran up and down
from place to place like a Mad Woman,
crying to the firſt ſhe met, and beging
with her Hands folded together, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcue
her out of the Fire, though there
were People more than enough ready to
extinguiſh it, and that it burnt nothing
but the Linnen Cloath, which was not
much bigger than an ordinary Table-Cloath:
But the Danger being over, ſhe
play'd the Gaſcon again among her Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo's,
as if ſhe her ſelf had ſav'd the
whole City of <hi>Rome</hi> from being burnt.</p>
            <p>Before ſhe went away from <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi>
ſhe gave a Magnificent Treat to
many great Lords and Ladies which
were in the <hi>Suediſh</hi> Intereſt, and the
Marquis <hi>Del Monte</hi> was the Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
or Manager of this Feaſt. 'Twas
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54799:40"/>
prepared in a very ſpacious Tennis-Court,
around the ſide whereof were
high Scaffolds erected as if for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
a Comedy in a Theatre, on
which a vaſt number of Spectators were
placed to behold it. But I ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to make a Deſcription thereof,
nor ſpeak of the abundance and delicacy
of the Meats, which were dreſs'd with
excellent Skill, and adorned with the
greateſt Curioſity imaginable. A more
Eloquent Pen than mine would write
nothing but truth, if he compar'd it
with the moſt ſumptuous Banquets of
the Antients; and eſpecially when he
ſhould introduce the Inſtruments of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
with the moſt Charming Voices,
giving an Account of the moſt harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Conſorts perform'd by the skilfulleſt
Hands; and deſcribe the great variety
of coſtly Illuminations, which ſeem'd
even to out-do the Sun it ſelf. After all
there was a grand Ball, with variety of
Dances, wherein the Cavaliers and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
acquitted themſelves with great
Applauſe; and the Joy was in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
perfectly compleat. But the
Marquis <hi>Del Monte</hi> had more reaſon than
any other, for beſides the Share he had
of the Banquet, and the Entertainment
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:54799:41"/>
of his Eyes and Ears, he obtain'd Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of ſome eaſie Ladies. But above
all the forgot not his chief Ends, for
<hi>Clairet</hi> aſſured me, That above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Piſtoles of the Charge of this ſtuck
to his Fingers. And to keep <hi>Landini</hi>
ſtill at his Devotion, he took her by the
Hand, and Danc'd with her as Maid
of Honour to the Queen, tho' that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
was not at all her due, for ſhe was a
very Contemptible Woman, whoſe ill
Conditions and Scandalous Behaviour,
would have driven her out of any Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For indeed under the Reign of <hi>Roſpigli

that it ſurpaſſed all others in
Splendour and Gallantry. New Shows

one another in ſuch ſort, that
commonly the Morning was ſpent in
Devotion and Buſineſs, and after Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which was generally very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
and ſerv'd up with extraordinary
Curioſity (for they begun then to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the <hi>French</hi> Mode) they went to a
Comedy, or Opera, where the Machines
were very ſurprizing, or elſe heard ſome
great Maſter's Compoſition of excellent
Muſick, performed with variety both
of Inſtruments and Voices. That Holy
Father who was naturally Generous, and
Beneficent, inſpir'd theſe good Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
into his Nephews. Avarice had no
Dominion over thoſe young Lords, as
in the Reigns of other Popes; but on
the contrary, they ſpent more than
their Revenues would well allow, and
yet they ſo well knew how to make
their Intereſts in that Court, that they
are now the richeſt Princes in <hi>Rome.</hi>
The Ladies all dreſt very richly, and
the <hi>French</hi> Modes being then it troduc'd,
they appear'd ſo charming in their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
that they could never afterwards
reſolve to leave them, but have retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them to this very Day; ſo that at
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54799:42"/>
this preſent Luxury exceſſive at <hi>Rome.</hi>
Nor did Love fail to make his Party,
for many enrol'd themſelves under his
Banners, hoping to make an happy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
under ſo flouriſhing a Reign. But
this good time did not endure long; for
the untimely Death of that Pope blaſted
many Intrigues which were but juſt in
their Bud, becauſe this Accident chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
both the Fortune and Intereſt of a
great many People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clement</hi> X. being made Pope <hi>Anno</hi>
1671. after a Conclave of ſix Months,
they reaſſum'd the ſame Courſe of living
as before. For Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> who
govern'd the Eccleſiaſtical State under
his Pontificate, after he had been adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Nephew by this, did not put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the trouble of reforming any
thing, provided he could but heap up
Riches for himſelf, of which he was
always known to be covetous enough;
ſo that there was a ſufficient Liberty for
People to ruine themſelves by exceſſive
Profuſion. <hi>Don Gaſper,</hi> who by his <hi>Niſe</hi>
was the Pope's Nephew, tho' he were
not of ſo eaſie and ſo generous a Spirit,
as they of the Family of <hi>Roſpiglioſi,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
yet very ſplendid and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
and the Ladies were more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54799:42"/>
than ever. So that in the beginning
of this Reign there was nothing to be
ſeen but Rejoycings at <hi>Rome;</hi> Promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Cardinals, and the pompous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
of Ambaſſadors. The firſt was
that of <hi>Portugal</hi> which was very ſolemn,
being performed in a moſt ſtately Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade,
by reaſon it was an Ambaſſade of
Obedience; that is to ſay, it was the
firſt time the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> ſent an
Embaſſy to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince his Family had
reaſcended that Throne; and it was of
no ſmall Glory for him to be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by the Pope among the number
of Crown'd Heads.</p>
            <p>After this was the Entry of the <hi>French</hi>
Ambaſſador the Duke <hi>D'Etree</hi>'s, which
was no leſs ſplendid than the former,
though it was only made in Coaches,
there being at leaſt five hundred, drawn
by ſix Horſes each, attended with very
rich Liveries; but above all that of the
Ambaſſador was moſt glorious, for the
Family of the <hi>D'Etree</hi>'s took great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to appear magnificent and pompous
upon all Occaſions which they had to
expreſs their Zeal for the Service and
Honour of their grand Monarch. Then
alſo the publick Comedies were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
at <hi>Torra di Nona</hi> by the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54799:43"/>
of Count <hi>Alibert</hi> and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
during the Carnaval time. A ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Box was there fitted up for the
Queen with extraordinary magnificence,
whereon neither gilding nor any other
Ornaments were ſpared, and it was
hung with Damask, and other rich Stuffs
adorned with fine Lace and Fringes of
Gold. This Box might contain fifteen
or ſixteen Perſons, and there were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ten or a dozen Cardinals who went
to the Comedy to Honour and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the Queen in her Box, as they did
alſo in her glazed Gallery, which was

which forbids Men to wear Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Apparel, as being an Abomination
before God. The Novelty of this Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
drew ſuch vaſt numbers of People
thither, that they had much ado to get
Entrance for Money. For at that time
was a great Concourſe of Strangers of
Quality there, who had brought with
them the Neweſt Modes from abroad,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54799:44"/>
which the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavaliers imitated,
and made themſelves all fine and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant.</p>
            <p>There was one among the reſt who
was of the firſt Rank, and ſurpaſs'd
them all in richneſs of Cloaths, his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was middle ſized, the Features of
his Face rarely compos'd, his Eyes black
and as lively as thoſe of the fineſt <hi>Roman</hi>
Ladies, he had a happy Phyſiognomy,
and a Head of Hair which made him
one of the handſomeſt Gentlemen in
<hi>Italy.</hi> He Sung and Play'd rarely well
upon divers ſorts of Inſtruments, was a
great lover of Poetry, and had alſo
himſelf compos'd three fine Pieces. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
indeed, if with all theſe Advantages
he would have Correſponded with the
Ladies Deſires, for there was more than
one who were willing to have put him
to the Proof; but he made no anſwer to
their Attempts, as we ſhall preſently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quianit
you. He was then in the Flower
of his Youth, being entred into the
twenty third Year of his Age, and his
Blood boyl'd in his Veins, which made
him appear all Spirit.</p>
            <p>The Queen ſeeing this young Lord
in a Box juſt over againſt her, as he was
making a profound Bow to her, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:54799:44"/>
felt an extraordinary Emotion,
by looking upon him, and having learnt
his Quality and perſonal Merit, it aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
the Eſteem which this Princeſs
began to have for him, and ſhe could
not forbear caſting her Eyes towards his
Box very often. A little while after
one of Her Majeſties <hi>Valets de Chambre,</hi>
who had been an old experienc'd Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
at Love Intrigues, hearing the Queen
one Day ſpeak many kind things of
this young Prince, and at the ſame time
ſay, She had a mind to have her Hair
cut, took his opportunity to tell her;
<hi>Madam</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the Prince</hi> Don Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
(for that was the Name of this young
Lord) <hi>has a</hi> Valet de Chambre <hi>a Perri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wig-maker,
who cuts Hair rarely well.</hi> The
Queen raviſht with the Thoughts of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an occaſion to ſpeak well of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for whom ſhe had ſo ſtrong an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
ſent for the Perrwig-maker,
who performing his Office according to
her Deſire, after having ſpoken very
advantagiouſly of his Maſter, gave him
ten Piſtols. One of the Queens Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
was afterwards with the Prince,
who told him, That he was extreamly
joyful that the Queen had ſo far ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd
him as to make uſe of one of his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54799:45"/>
Servants; to which the Officer anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in few words, but ſetting forth the
Queens admirable Qualities in the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt
Expreſſions he could invent. The
Prince mightily extoll'd her, and Her
Majeſty was inform'd of all he ſaid to
her Advantage, and was infinitely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with it.</p>
            <p>Another time ſhe ſent to the Prince
to deſire him to let her ſee one of his
Perriwigs; ſhe tried it on, and made a
ſhort one of the ſame colour, being of a
fair and bright colour, which ſhe wore
many times afterwards. When the
Queen was in private among her Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
there was nothing to be heard but
the Praiſes of <hi>Don Benigno,</hi> and no other
Subject could afford her ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
as that. One of her Maids a great
Favourite at that time, who was very
handſome and well ſhap'd, call'd <hi>Signora
Octavia,</hi> hearing her ſpeak ſo often in
the praiſe of this young Prince, fell in
Love with him, but not daring to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
her Affection, ſhe conſum'd and pin'd
away. The Queen was troubled, and
ſeeing her thus Languiſh without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Cauſe, oblig'd her to go and
take the Country Air. <hi>Octavia</hi> choſe
to go to <hi>Fraſcati,</hi> as being one of the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54799:45"/>
moſt delicious Places about <hi>Rome,</hi> where
the greateſt part of the Cardinals, and
Gentlemen of <hi>Rome</hi> had Vineyards and
Houſes of Pleaſure, which look'd like
ſo many Enchanted Palaces. <hi>Don Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigno</hi>
had one there which was none of
the leaſt, and he was actually himſelf
there, enjoying the Pleaſures of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
Seaſon of the Spring. The Queen
gave <hi>Octavia</hi> two Calaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>acquies; and ſhe brought her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Siſter, and ſome other Women a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with her, and for <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi>
ſhe would have that Intriguing Purvoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our

they alighted in a private place, becauſe

(for that is the Name of the
Purveyor) took care of preparing the
Dinner, while the Women went to
Maſs at the Capuchins, and in the way
met <hi>Don Benigno</hi> by chance. <hi>Octavia</hi>
turn'd her ſelf aſide, that ſhe might hide
the Bluſhes which appear'd in her Face,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54799:46"/>
though they render'd her yet more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful.
There was only a ſingle Salute
on either ſide, and after the walking of
a Turn or two, they return'd to a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Dinner at their Lodging; for in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>

<hi>Achelmere</hi> made him a profound Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
and thanked him for his Regale
in the Name of the Company, who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
with him in the Obligations they
all had to ſo generous a Lord. The
Prince ſmil'd and ſaid, It was only a
Triſle, and did not deſerve to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd;
that he would have offer'd the
Ladies an Apartment in his Palace, with

               </gap>ſſary Conveniences, but that he
had not done it, for fear of burthening
them with incommodious Civilities, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they would think themſelves more
at Liberty, than either with him, or
the Queen, whoſe Officers ſhould be

the Conductor, told him, He was very
happy to be ſo much conſider'd by his
Excellency. The Prince anſwer'd, That
he had a Value for them all in general.

               <hi>Do not envy my Happineſs, Madam,</hi> (ſays
<hi>Alchelmere) 'tis only for your ſake that

the Honour of being his Servant along time
ago.</hi> This was ſpoke only <hi>en paſſant;</hi>
but the glances of the Eye have a more
paſſionate Language: But the Prince im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
left them, in order to rejoyn
his Company, who were already got
at a conſiderable diſtance. After they
had ſeen the Vineyard and the Caſcades,
they return'd to <hi>Rome</hi> the ſame Night;
and the Queen who would know all the
particulars of the Voyage, was extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleas'd with the Prince's Gallantry.
She was the beſt Miſtreſs in the World,
when ſhe was in a good Humour, and
ſhe ſeem'd to take it ill, that her Maids
had not ſtay'd three or four days in
the Country. Two days after the Prince
came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſent to ſeek <hi>Archel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere,</hi>
to ask him who that Maid was,
for whom he already felt ſo ſtrong an
Inclination. <hi>Achelmere</hi> told him, it was
<hi>Signora Octavia,</hi> That ſhe was one of
the Queen's Confidents; adding withal,
that ſhe was charm'd with the Merit of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54799:47"/>
ſo Accompliſh'd a Prince. The Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſhe often gave him at ſeveral other
Meetings, caus'd him perfectly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
it. Words are ſeldom made
uſe of in <hi>Italy;</hi> and they can manage
an Intrigue well enough without 'em.
But the Prince, who ſhew'd ſo much
Ardor at firſt, relented preſently, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that <hi>Octavia</hi> would conſent without
much Entreaty, though ſhe had taken
precautions not to ſuffer an immediate
Shipwrack. However it was, ſome odd
Reflection or other chang'd the Prince's
mind, for he went to the Rendeſvouze,
and after that, <hi>Octavia</hi> conceiv'd an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
Spight againſt him, whilſt her
Introducer was Confounded, and gain'd
nothing but Hatred on both ſides.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the Queen, who
as yet knew not the Prince's cold tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
gave him him ſufficient Hints, both
by Signs and dark Speeches, as ſhe found
Opportunity, that himſelf was the cauſe
if he were not Happy. They h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d much
ado to aſſure him, that he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ght diſpose
of the Queen's Perſon, ſeeing he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
her Heart already; but he would
never paſs the bounds of the moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Gallantry. The more the Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
were br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke, the more reſerv'd he
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54799:48"/>
became, though afar off out of Danger,
he teſtified a great deal of Ardour to
meet the Queen's Flame, who deſpair'd
to make any thing of him, by reaſon of
his Fearfulneſs and over great Reſpect.
He was offer'd what Security he pleas'd,
that the Queen her ſelf ſhould come <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cognito</hi>
to what Place he pleas'd, and that
ſhe ſhould be at his Diſpoſal; but the
very conceit made him Abhor it. At
laſt the Queen was perfectly aſham'd to
explain her ſelf too clearly; and the
Rage to find her ſelf Slighted, converted
her Love into implacable Hate; and if
ſhe did not take a ſolemn Revenge, it
was to be look'd upon only as an effect
of her Goodneſs: So dangerous a thing
it is to be either Lov'd or Hated by
Great Perſons.</p>
            <p>If the Prince had refus'd the Queen
only, it might have been ſaid, That
the fear of falling into the ſame Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
with the Marquiſs <hi>Monaldeſchi,</hi>
had hinder'd him. But he has alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd
the Fires of many other Ladies,
who have accus'd him of Impotence, or
a Timidity unworthy of his Rank: for
the World does not eſteem a Perſon
who contains himſelf within a Principle
of Religion. We have ſeen how his
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54799:48"/>
Courage fail'd him in his Intrigues with
<hi>Octavia;</hi> and we ſhall find preſently,
that he ſhewed no greater, in the caſe
of a fair Dutcheſs, who had all the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
requiſite to make a Lady Belov'd.
'Twas ſaid, that Prince <hi>Columbieri</hi> had
Lov'd her a little before <hi>Don Benigno</hi>
had ſettled his Affections there, and
that he was very well ſatisfied. <hi>Don
Benigno</hi> finding the place vacant when
he enterpriz'd the Conqueſt of <hi>Diana</hi>'s
Heart, for that was the Name of the
Dutcheſs; firſt made uſe of a Porter to
a numerous Community, who had Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
for their Arms, but not finding
him fit for Management, employ'd a
French Merchant that liv'd near to
St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s, becauſe he Serv'd the
Dutcheſs, and was very capable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
an Amorous Intrigue. After a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Careſſes, he open'd his Deſign to
him, and promis'd him Mountains and
Wonders as Lovers us'd to do, and
put the conduct of his Affairs into his
Hand.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as this Confident came to the
Dutcheſs, under pretence of bringing
her a new <hi>French</hi> Stuff, he fell on the
reading of a Billet while her Back was
turn'd, but ſuffer'd himſelf to be Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:54799:49"/>
The Dutcheſs ask'd what it
was? The Merchnat, who was Familiar
with her, told her it was the Pleaſanteſt
Paper in the World, and that it was a
Billet of Love in behalf of the Perſon he
Eſteem'd moſt. I'm reſolv'd I will ſee
it, ſaid <hi>Diana.</hi> Hold, Madam, anſwers
this rare Merchant, or otherwiſe you

I muſt own that this confident Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was as fit an Inſtrument as could
be thought o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for this Affair, provided

               </gap>an not Riſque; for a Woman is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
pleas'd when ſhe is perſwaded ſhe
is Amiable. This Princeſs, whoſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
carry'd her to read this Billet,
believing it to be another thing, was
Surpriz'd at this new way of hearing
her ſelf to be Belov'd, and became
as a Roſe, remaining perfectly Silent
for ſome time in a Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fuſion, which
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54799:49"/>
ſhew'd a ſtrong agitation of her Mind.</p>
            <p>The Duke her Husband entred the
Chamber at the ſame time, to ſee the
Stuff the Merchant had brought before
they cut it, and ſeeing the Dutcheſs in
a great Trouble, ask'd her if ſhe were
not ſatisfied with ſo fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e a Stuff, which
appear'd to him to be very Rich. She
teſtified her Content, but ſaid ſhe would
willingly have it all, becauſe the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of <hi>Sonino</hi> had a Mantua and Petti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat
very like that which ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
The Secret, ſaith the Merchant,
is to take whole Piece, for I aſſure you
there is no more ſuch in <hi>Rome. Claude</hi>
has Reaſon, ſays the Duke, and I
would counſel you to buy the whole
Piece, if it be not too Dear; as to
the reſt, I believe he will be Faithful.
Yes <hi>Monſigneur,</hi> ſays the Merchant, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
may reckon that I will be Secret
in that, and every other thing, and at
the foot of the Account 30 Piſtols, more
or leſs ought not to hinder her Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
from taking a Stuff which is the
moſt in Mode, and eſpecially when there
will be none like it for a long time.
See what an Admirable Fellow this is,
ſays the good Husband, buy it Madam,
but take care to ſee the Stuff well Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:54799:50"/>
There was nothing elſe worthy of
Remark which paſs'd in this firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview;
and the Merchant went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to give Don <hi>Benigno</hi> an account
of his Negotiation. The Prince find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Declaration very Ingenious, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
the Merchant, and told him,
that he had begun very well, and pray'd
him to continue it till ſuch time as he
was Happy. Two days after, he came
again to bring her the Lining of her
Garment, and ſhe had been impatient
to ſee him; but by a Slyneſs peculiar to
Ladies, when they have a regard to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
ſhe expected when he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.
Being then alone with her, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
to know of her, what effect his Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
had produc'd; She ſat down upon
her Couch, and ſaid, with a ſeeming
Careleſneſs, that ſhe made no account
of it; and that ſhe was unwilling to
embark her ſelf in an Amour with a
young Man who was over Bold, that
preſum'd too much of himſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was a fine Youth, believ'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
a <hi>Narciſſus.</hi> The Merchant aſſur'd
her, that the Prince had an inviolable
and inſeperable Affection for her; and
that as his Paſſion could not be greater,
ſo his Reſpect and Fidelity would not
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:54799:50"/>
be the leſs. Upon theſe aſſurances, ſhe
told the Merchant, Monſieur <hi>Claude,</hi> ſaid
ſhe, I beg of you not to Flatter me with
any hope, till I have made Trial, for
under pretence of guarding all the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
that are neceſſary, I ſhall find whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will perſevere or no She then
confeſſed to the Merchant, that ſhe had
ſome inclination for him, and that he
ſhould not be unhappy upon her Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>I believe ſhe had reaſon to ſay this,
for ſhe perfectly knew the Perſon of
whom ſhe ſpake; for without doubt,
if his Vigour had anſwer'd his Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he had wherewithal to pleaſe the
Ladies. However, he was yet ſuch a
Novice, that he thought 'twas ſufficient
to tell a Lady he was Amorous of her,
to oblige her to have the ſame Paſſion
for him. But he found in the Perſon of
<hi>Diana,</hi> a Woman that knew how to
teach People Manners, and inſtruct him
how to Live.</p>
            <p>One day Don <hi>Benigno</hi> being at <hi>Freſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi>
was Attack'd by three Ladies, who
believing themſelves Handſome, ſet with
their Tongues very briskly upon him.
One of them was the Marchioneſs <hi>Nari,</hi>
who told him in Railery, That as Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54799:51"/>
and fine Shap'd as he was, he had
found the Ladies Cruel; that they had
hear'd news of his Affairs, and were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd
to that beautiful Perſon to whom
he paid his Vows, for preſerving in him
a reſpect for the Sex. He was ſtung
with theſe Words, but kept ſtill to his
Indifference for the Ladies; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
his vanity being excited, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to make uſe of all things to make
himſelf Beloved of <hi>Diana.</hi> And he did
very well at firſt, for after he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſome Signs of Perſeverance, he made
a Preſent to the Dutcheſs, of a Slk Stuff
with a blew Ground, ſtrip'd with Silver
Columns, interwoven with moſt beautiful
Leaves Flowers both of Gold and Silver,
to a great Value. To conceal this from the
Duke, the Dutcheſs made him believe
that the Merchant was content with the
third part in Money, and for the reſt
he would take Wheat and Wine, at ſo
much <hi>per</hi> Month, till 'twas all paid.
The Duke was very glad of it; for in
<hi>Rome</hi> the Great Lords have oftentimes
but little Money, becauſe they Farm a
great part of their Eſtates themſelves,
and have but few Tenants that pay them
in ready Money.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:54799:51"/>
The Dutcheſs after this, became a
little more Familiar with Don <hi>Benigno;</hi>
and the Carneval being come, the Prince
often went out in Maſquerade, wearing
a ſhort Cloak ſurr'd with Ermines, with
a ſmall Cuffedg'd with Bone-lace, and
a red Ribban on his Head, which was
the Signal to make himſelf known by.
<hi>Diana</hi> was in the Balcony as the Train
went along, and look'd upon him with
a ſweet and Languiſhing Eye; and they
ſaw one another at Comedies, and danc'd
together at Balls; but this afforded on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an opportunity of ſpeaking ſome few
Words by Stealth, the Italian Jealouſie
not permitting a regular Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at ſuch times. He would willingly
have obtain'd ſome Favour from <hi>Diana,</hi>
but ſhe had a mind to make him value
the thing, however, ſhe promis'd that ſhe
would find an opportunity in the Lent
time to ſatisfie his Deſires.</p>
            <p>The firſt Week being come, the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſvouze
was agreed upon, which was
to be in a Garden <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ear St. <hi>Sabina,</hi> upon
Mount <hi>Aventine,</hi> into which there is an
entrance at two different Gates. Don
<hi>Benigno</hi> came there in a cloſe Coach,
which was left about Fifty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from
the Privy Gate. The Dutcheſs who came
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:54799:52"/>
by the great Gate, receiv'd him very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably,
while his Confident enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
her Aſſociate, till ſuch time they
had inſenſibly got a good diſtance from
them. <hi>Diana</hi> who for this time had a
mind only to Amuſe the Prince, order'd
her Follower not to loſe ſight of her;
and ſhe oblig'd her, though ſhe kept
her ſelf out of Call. The Converſation
laſted about half an Hour with equal
Satisfaction. Don <hi>Benigno</hi> was very
well content with this firſt Interview;
but as in <hi>Italy</hi> they have but little liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of ſeeing one another, he deſir'd the
favour to write to her, and the pleaſure
of Receiving her Anſwers. <hi>Diana</hi> made
a great difficulty of this, and ſaid, there
was leſs danger in ſatisfying a Lover, by
yielding the laſt Favours, than to write
to him and receive his Letters; becauſe
if a Lover ſhould boaſt of Privacies with
his Miſtreſs, (as it often happen'd) ſhe
had power to deny it all; but as for
Letters, the Characters being once
known, they were certain and undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Teſtimonies. At laſt, by the means
of Prayers and Intreaties, he obtain'd
ſo far as to have Billets, upon condition
he ſent them back in his Anſwers. All
theſe Difficulties being Surmounted, the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54799:52"/>
concluſion of ſome twenty Letters were
made by a Rendeſvouz with <hi>Diana</hi> at
a certain Hour, at which Don <hi>Benigno</hi>
did not fail.</p>
            <p>He came very late at Night with his
Confident, and they enter'd by the Back-Gate
of the Lady's Palace. They wrap'd
their Faces in their Cloaks, and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a pair of Stairs without ſeeing any
Body, till they came to the uttermoſt
Lanthorn, where they found a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
Don <hi>Arimatheia,</hi> Brother to <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
who looking upon them a little,
went away, and ſaid Laughing, <hi>God
ſend you good Luck, my Friends.</hi> Being
come into a little Gallery, which led
into <hi>Clarice</hi>'s Chamber, <hi>Diana</hi>'s Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
They were not yet at the end of
their Troubles; for having ſhut up their
dark Lanthorns, they knew not where
they went. The Merchant, who knew
the Paſſages, went firſt, groaping the
way, but thought he ſhould have been
Strangled by the Prince, becauſe he
pull'd him ſo hard by the Cloak. At
laſt, after a Labyrinth of turnings, they
entred into a little Chamber, where the
firſt thing they ſaw, was the Head of
a Bed, and a Crucifix upon it Ten Foot
high. Above It was a ſmall Picture of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:54799:53"/>
St. <hi>Francis,</hi> encompaſs'd with a Chaplet
about an Ell long, and the Bed w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not
above two Foot high from the Ground.</p>
            <p>Don <hi>Benigno</hi> had put on a black Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwig
inſtead of the light Hair'd one,
which he always wore, and Combing
it, expected when the Nymph would
arrive, aſſuring himſelf, that he was
prepar'd for the Combat, and carried
good Arms to attack and batter the
Fort in a moſt regular manner. A little
after, the Dutcheſs appear'd at the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
end of the Gallery, and came brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and more ſparkling than the Moon;
ſhe had a Wax Candle in her hand, her
Habit looſe and white, and her Head
dreſs'd very advantagiouſly. She had a
fine Knot of red Ribbands on her Breaſt,
which being but half diſcover'd, gave a
great luſtre to one of the fineſt Necks
in the World. Don <hi>Benigno</hi> was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in a Maze at her Approach, till
after the firſt Compliments were over:
Then the Merchant retir'd, leaving the
Lovers at full liberty to do what they
pleas'd. But all paſs'd in Ceremonies,
Don <hi>Benigno</hi> knew not how to ſay any
other thing to <hi>Diana,</hi> than that he died
for Love of her, and that though ſhe
left him at liberty to enterprize any
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:54799:53"/>
thing, yet he durſt not attempt what
he moſt deſir'd. So going away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doing what was expected. He was
afterwards aſham'd of his Baſhfulneſs,
and had a great mind to repair his fault:
But a ſecond Audience which was agree'd
to, did nothing but divulge the Secret;
ſo that Prince <hi>Columbiere</hi> having got the
Wind of it, procured ſix Fellows to
wait for Don <hi>Benigno</hi> under the Portal
of the Palace <hi>D'Eſtre;</hi> where preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a dark Lanthorn to his Face, that
they might know him, they retir'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
as if they had been the Round,
though one of them follow'd him at a
diſtance, as far as <hi>Diana</hi>'s Palace. There
Don <hi>Benigno</hi> got admittance, but was on
purpoſe Baffled as before: From which
the Prince <hi>Columbiere</hi> did not fail upon
the firſt occaſion to congratulate him
upon the number of his Miſtreſſes,
which he told him, hindred his being
able to ſatisfie them all.</p>
            <p>This join'd to the Advice he had that
the Prince <hi>Columbieri</hi> ſaw <hi>Diana</hi> again,
renew'd his Paſſion, Jealouſie working
a more powerful Effect upon him than
Love. He complain'd of <hi>Diana</hi> that
ſhe preferr'd an old Man before a Youth
full of Vigour, and ready to ſatisfie
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:54799:54"/>
the Ladies at all times, whereas the
Prince <hi>Colombieri</hi> muſt have eight Days
to prepare himſelf. Theſe Complaints
were carried to the Dutcheſs by the
Merchant, word for word; to whom
ſhe anſwer'd, that <hi>Don Benigno</hi> was
worſe than the Prince <hi>Columbieri;</hi> for,
ſaid ſhe, if he muſt have eight Days to
prepare himſelf, I have given that Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
more than three Months, and he
has always fail'd me in the occaſion.
Madam, reply'd the Merchant, that
may happen through too much Ardour,
as it did in <hi>France</hi> to the Count <hi>de Guiche.</hi>
Fie, fie, anſwer'd <hi>Diana,</hi> that's a meer
Trifle; for though it may once happen
ſo, yet a Man of Vigour is never more
diſtinguiſhed then upon ſuch occaſions.
The Merchant knew not what to anſwer
in defence of ſo ill a cauſe. Believe me
honeſt <hi>Claud</hi> (purſued ſhe) your Friend
is not like the Scorpions which ſting
with their Tail; for he ſtings only
with his Tongue; and we ought to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt
thoſe great Boaſters, which make
a fair Appearance, and are good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
The Merchant then to divert
her, ſaid, Madam, a Man of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
Stature, large Shoulders,
brawny Limbs, and full of Muſcles,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:54799:54"/>
that has black Hair, a brown Viſage,
and full of Vigour, is 35 Years old,
with Eyes ſparkling and fill'd with
Fire: And as to the reſt, though the
Man be not handſome, is he good for
nothing? Very good, ſaid ſhe, that is
as we love; 'tis for Women to be fair,
and for Men to be brisk, and methinks
you do very much reſemble that Man.
She lay then upon her fine downy
Couch, with her Breaſts naked, in a
very tempting poſture, when at that
inſtant one came and ſcratch'd at the
door to give notice that Cardinal <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonna</hi>
was below and come to make her
a Viſit. She aroſe in haſte, took her
Coif, and went to the Cardinal, while the
Merchant ſlipp'd into a Cloſet, and from
thence into the Wardrobe, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
went his way by a private pair
of Stairs. He went then to <hi>Don Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigno</hi>
to tell him that if he did not uſe
<hi>Diana</hi> better, it would oblige her to
renew her Friendſhip with Prince <hi>Colom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bieri;</hi>
but he took the thing wrong,
and made uſe of this pretence to break
off with <hi>Diana.</hi> He ſaid he would not
have the Leavings of Prince <hi>Colombieri,</hi>
who was the Town-Bull of <hi>Rome,</hi> and
had certain Diſtempers which he ſhould
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54799:55"/>
be ſorry to contract; yet the Prince <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lombieri</hi>
was very well and in perfect
Health; ſo was the Dutcheſs alſo freſh,
and ſound as a Roach.</p>
            <p>To be ſhort, <hi>Don Benigno</hi> went to
the Dutcheſs no more, and, to ſpite
her, kept one of her Letters, which he
was reſolved never to reſtore. All the
Revenge ſhe could take, was to laugh
at him with the Queen, with whom ſhe
was very great: When they ſpoke of
him together, it was with the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Contempt; they treated him as
the moſt wretched Man living, and ever
loaded him with all the Jeers and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
they could invent. And the
Queen who took a great liberty of
Speech, had certain Expreſſions for him
in <hi>French,</hi> which ſhe was aſham'd to
ſpeak there in the <hi>Italian</hi> Language, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
thoſe Terms do not make ſuch an
Impreſſion in a ſtrange Language as in
our own, told <hi>Diana</hi> one day ſhe had
found a Nick-name which agreed with
him beſt of any, which was <hi>Limberham</hi>
or Fumbler. The Dutcheſs applauded
it, and both in concert cried, Let the
Devil take the Fumbler.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Benigno</hi> durſt come no more to
the Queen's, though he us'd to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:54799:55"/>
very often, and particularly when
ſhe kept her Academy, whither alſo
the fineſt Wits in <hi>Rome</hi> reſorted; and
he took the pretence of being unwilling
to have any Converſation with the
Marquis <hi>del Monte,</hi> whom the Queen
had made great Maſter of her Horſe;
and, to ſpite her Majeſty, he oblig'd
his Siſter the Princeſs <hi>Altamira,</hi> to turn
away the Page ſhe had, who was Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to Seignora <hi>Octavia,</hi> and which ſhe
had taken out of reſpect to the
Queen.</p>
            <p>But Love was not the only amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Royal Lady; Chymiſtry
was her more ſerious buſineſs, though
ſhe had loſt conſiderable Sums of Money
by it at <hi>Hamburgh;</hi> and particularly
with one <hi>Borry</hi> a Chymiſt of <hi>Milan,</hi> who
is now condemned to perpetual Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment
for Hereſie in the Caſtle of
St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> and who return'd her only
Cinders and Smoak for 2 or 3 thouſand
Crowns. The unfortunate Experiments
ſhe had often made, excited her to go
forward in the ſearch of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's
Stone. As ſoon as ſhe arriv'd
at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhe built a great Laboratory
in her Palace, and conſumed the beſt
part of her ready Caſh, not ſo much in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54799:56"/>
Coals and Ingredients, as the Roguery
of the People ſhe employ'd in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
Trade; for 'tis ordinary with
great People to be robb'd by thoſe they
put the moſt Confidence in. Cardinal
<hi>Azzolini,</hi> who would not openly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
himſelf to this her predominant
Paſſion, preſented a Chymiſt to her, who
was named <hi>Bandiere</hi> the Son of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary,
in a little City of <hi>Romagina</hi>
near to <hi>Bologne,</hi> thinking that by this
means he had ſufficiently engag'd her to
keep within ſome reaſonable bounds,
himſelf pretending to follow the Queen's
Inclination for Chymiſtry. But though
this Man render'd an exact Account of
all things to appearance, the Cardinal
eaſily found out a great deal of Rogue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
ſeeing there was ſcarce a Month
paſs'd, wherein the Expence upon Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry,
which they call'd Diſtillation,
did not amount to three, and ſometimes
four thouſand Livres. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
his Pretences, he had only ſome
Secrets in Chymiſtry of little uſe, and
ſuſtain'd himſelf upon nothing but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent
Tattle, and fabulous Receipts
of fine Experiments, which he had
never made. In a little time he had
the Artifice to inſinuate himſelf very
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:54799:56"/>
much into the Queen's Favour, by his
unreaſonable Complaiſance, ſo eaſie was
ſhe to be govern'd by People of no
Account. But this way of Proceeding
did not always ſucceed; for ſometimes
ſhe beat him, and handled him very ill
more ways than one. 'Tis impoſſible
to reckon up all the Rogueries he had
done in his Life; but above all, while
he was ſupported by the Queen: And
yet notwithſtanding the ill Treatment
he ſometimes met with, he made bold
with all Mankind, except the Queen
whom he was forc'd to flatter, and ſuch
as durſt ſhew their Teeth; for to theſe
he was very humble, being the greateſt
Coward in the World, though he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
went arm'd with Piſtols and Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onnets.
He was a Lyar to the utter-Point,
and a Traitor to that did him
good, as well as thoſe that hurt him;
very much addicted to Women, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
always drunk when he had no buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
with the Queen.</p>
            <p>After the Heat of this Princeſs was
a little abated; (that is to ſay, after
three or four Years,) ſhe was willing to
content the Cardinal, and bargain with
<hi>Bandiere</hi> to undertake this Diſtillation
at two hundred Piſtols <hi>per</hi> Month,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:54799:57"/>
which he was oblig'd to accept of; for
beſides this he got Cloaths, with fifteen
Crowns wages <hi>per</hi> Month, and many
other little Profits; but he committed
ſo many Rogueries, that he muſt have
a good memory that is able to reckon
them. Thoſe who underſtand any
thing of Chymiſtry, know what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Utenſils and Inſtruments are
requiſite to ſuch Undertakings, not
only in Coals and Furnaces, but in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
pieces of Earth and Glaſs, Vials,
Alembicks, Mortars, and other Veſſels
of Earth and Metal. But the greateſt
Expence is in Drugs, Quick-ſilver, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge,
Lead, and a thouſand other
Ingredients which they pretend to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
into Gold. The Queen would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
go her ſelf, to calcine, filter, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill,
and to find out that which was
never found. The miſerable <hi>Bandiere</hi>
was the Jeſt of the Queen and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
who being willing to put the
Queen into a diſguſt of this Trade, was
very glad to ſee all things go croſs:
So that <hi>Bondiere</hi> paſſed his Days with
trouble enough, but the Nights brought
an heap of Miſeries upon him; for then
the Queen being at leiſure, would keep
him lock'd for ſix or ſeven hours toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:54799:57"/>
at his Furnaces; and becauſe ſhe
could never meet with what ſhe ſought
for, ſhe would throw at his head any
thing that came next to her Hand, and
ſometimes would give him good rough
blows with a Faggot-ſtick.</p>
            <p>At laſt the Queen perceiv'd that the
Cardinal only laugh'd at theſe her Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
yet becauſe ſhe would not break
with <hi>Bandiere,</hi> but keep ſome meaſures
with him, ſhe ordered him to make
Bills of what he wanted for Manual
Operation, imagining ſhe ſhould ſave
ſomething, when he had no more the
management of the Money: So <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diere</hi>
went for his Powders and other
Drugs to the Druggiſt: But at the
Year's end the Cardinal diſcovered that
it came all to the ſame Expence. Well
the Queen left off Chymiſtry for a time,
becauſe her Rents from <hi>Sweden</hi> came
not ſo current as formerly, by reaſon of
the War. Nevertheleſs ſhe pleaſed her
ſelf with making little Experiments,
and to draw Salts from many things.
I have ſeen <hi>Bandiere</hi> bring her little Bits
of Glaſs found in the digging of Caves,
and in the Chanels of <hi>Rome,</hi> and other
like Trinkets, and the Queen would
ſometimes commend him, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:54799:58"/>
again reward him with a Box on
the Ear. This miſerable Wretch was
ſometimes ſo vex'd, that he would call
her a thouſand Fools, and yet no body
durſt tell the Queen of it, becauſe ſhe
thought they bore Malice againſt him;
and that the Reports which were told
of him were nothing but ill Will, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to deſtroy him. But after all this
unhappy Man's Sufferings, he made all
others ſuffer in their turns, becauſe
he would be always whiſpering Stories
to the Queen, having the Priviledge at
all times to enter into any place where
ſhe was. Thus he became the Protector
of all the Villainies that were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in her Majeſty's Quarter; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in League with the Marquis <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l
Monte,</hi> wou'd diſcover to him all that
paſs'd between this Princeſs and the
Cardinal; which was eaſie for him to
do, knowing all corners of the Palace
where he might hide himſelf to hearken.
The Cardinal being enraged againſt
him, and grown almoſt deſperate,
ſhewed him a Trick of Kindneſs on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to deſtroy him. He begun to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs
him afreſh, and inſinuated into the
Queen to put into his Hands the Alms
of an hundred Crowns a Months, which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:54799:58"/>
ſhe caus'd to be diſtributed to the poor
Families of <hi>Rome.</hi> He was tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with this pious Office; but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
himſelf after ſuch a manner in
the doing of it, that the Cardinal had
quickly an Opportunity to revenge
himſelf of the Vexations he had given
him. For this Rogue in diſtributing
the Alms, inſtead of giving it to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Families according to the Queen's
Intention, gave it to People of an ill
Life to ſatiate his infamous Paſſions.
And becauſe he was oblig'd to ſhew
Certificates of Poverty ſign'd by the
Pariſh-Prieſts, he counterfeited them,
or elſe applied himſelf to Women and
Maids of Reputation to procure true
Certificates from them; and he ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
it that he ſubborn'd the greater
part of them at the 2d. or 3d. Viſit of
Charity, to give them an Alms in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.
Thoſe who would not abandon
themſelves to his Luſts, were depriv'd
of the Alms; and he gave in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
that they were People of a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Reputation, and did not deſerve
the Queen's Charity. They murmur'd
and complain'd to the Cardinal, but
he would take no Cognizance of the
Matter, craftily ſending both the poor
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54799:59"/>
People and the Pariſh-Prieſts to make
their Complaint to the Queen. A
zealous Curate, one of thoſe whom
they call the Pope's <hi>Barboni,</hi> went
boldly one Day to find her Majeſty;
but whether it was that the Prieſt did
not play his part well, or that the
Queen would not take notice of his
weakneſs, and her ill choice of <hi>Bandie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>
for her private <hi>Almoner,</hi> the <hi>Barboni</hi>
was child, and <hi>Bandie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi> denying his ill
Actions was believ'd upon his Word.
But as he was a Wretch whom no Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks
could make wiſe, he went on
at ſuch a rate, that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI.
had Complaints againſt him from all
ſides.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> going to an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the Holy Father, found that
he was angry, and he told him of it
in ſuch a manner, that the Cardinal
could not forbear writing a Letter to
the Queen about thoſe Complaints
which were made againſt <hi>Bandiere.</hi> The
Letter was brought unhappily at a time
when the Queen was embroil'd with
the Cardinal about other Affairs, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
that it was not well receiv'd;
nay, on the contrary, ſhe gave it to
<hi>Bandiere</hi> out of ſpite to the Cardinal,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:54799:59"/>
ſaying, <hi>Bandiere</hi> theſe wicked Prieſts
would ruine thee with me; but laugh
at both of them, for I will always take
care of thee.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bandiere</hi> kneeling down before the
Queen, with Crocodiles Tears implor'd
her protection, and afterwards ſhew'd
the Cardinal's Letter to all the World,
and gave him all the ill Language ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.
The poor Cardinal ſeeing
the Queen had thus ſacrific'd him, made
as if he never minded it; and becauſe
of his Heirſhip to the Queen, ſuffer'd
both this and a great deal more from
others, as well as <hi>Bandiere.</hi> But the
Cardinal's Heirs were well reveng'd
upon this Wretch, and reduced him to
that paſs that he periſhed for want, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
having been the reproach and ſcorn
of all that knew him. For as he had a
wicked Tongue, and had offended eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body, he found no Friend in time of
need, neither ought it to be at all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
at, if ſeeing he had diſhonour'd
ſo many honeſt Families, God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the ſame to fall upon his.</p>
            <p>He had a Daughter tolerably hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
but very ambitious, who was
not contented with the Cloaths her
Father would bring her, becauſe being
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:54799:60"/>
covetous, ſhe often wanted what was
neceſſary: She therefore contrived to
have them another way than from him.
For a certain Abbot happened to fall in
Love with her, who was an <hi>Italian</hi>
Gentleman deſcended from an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Family, and was called the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
<hi>Vannini;</hi> which Man became noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
for his Extravagancies, as you
will find in the progreſs of this Hiſtory.
For this our Prelate always loving a
ſweet Bit, and never valuing the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of it, his Propoſitions were quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
liſt'ned to; and the Concluſion was
made betwixt them without any great
Preliminaries: For in <hi>Italy</hi> they come
preſently to the Point in theſe kind of
Affairs, becauſe Opportunities are more
ſcarce there than elſewhere; and when
ſuch are preſented, Lovers never fail
to take their Advantage.</p>
            <p>One Night, though very late, as
<hi>Bandiere</hi> according to his Cuſtom came
from the Queen, he found a Guard at
the Door of his Lodging, who would
not ſuffer him to enter; and becauſe
<hi>Bandiere</hi> uſed to ſay he could lye when
he would at the Queen's, where he had
a Bed, our Lovers did not expect he
would have come to interrupt their
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:54799:60"/>
Pleaſures, and trouble the Merriment.
<hi>Bandiere</hi> being thus kept out of his
Houſe, laid his hand upon his Piſtol;
but whether it were that it did not take
Fire, or that he knew not how to
make uſe of it, two Men took hold of
his Cloaths and drubb'd him ſoundly,
but did not kill him. Theſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Companions went along with him
as far as his good Friend the Marquis
<hi>Del Monte</hi>'s Houſe, where he got in,
and ſhelter'd himſelf, paſſing the reſt
of the Night very ill. And, after all
this, his Daughter's Lover marched
off at his own leiſure; but the next
Day this Story was ſpread through
the whole City. <hi>Bandiere</hi> complain'd
of it to the Queen, who as ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
paid him home, told him, that he
ought not to think it ſtrange, if the
ſame meaſure were meted to him that
he himſelf meaſured to others. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Azzolini</hi> laughed with all his
Heart; and the Marquis <hi>Del Monte</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
had his part of the Concern, would
fain have perſwaded the Queen to put
this young Woman into a Monaſtery
for ſome time. But ſhe was only a
Young Thing, who had married her
ſelf without her Parent's Conſent to one
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54799:61"/>
who was better Acquainted with the
Daughter, than the Father: But
the poor Wretch died in Childbed of
her firſt Child.</p>
            <p>Now the Queen did not only ſearch
after the Art of making Gold, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to find out the Univerſal Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
and the Secret of living an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years. As ſhe was very eaſie of
belief, having read a Secret of this kind
in the <hi>Mercury Gallant,</hi> ſo ſhe would try
it upon her own Perſon, without any
Precaution; but ſhe quickly began to
ſwell ſo much that ſhe was ready to
burſt, and had been in a very ill conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if ſhe had not received a ſpeedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.
This Experiment not ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhe ſuffer'd her ſelf to be deluded
afterwards by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chymiſt, who
having entertain'd her one Day with a
great many things which were very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
aſſur'd that he had had a Secret
to prolong Life, and that by it Perſons
being of about fifty or ſixty Years of
Age, might maintain themſelves in the
ſame Vigour to Sixſcore Years, and
much further. He ſaid he had made the
Application upon himſelf, and being 70
Years old as he pretended, he had yet a
good Appetite, ſlept well, and had all the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:54799:61"/>
Functions of Life as a Man of fifty
Years old. And for a proof of his
Knowledge, he ſhewed her Certificates
from a great number of Perſons, whom
he had not only cur'd of ſtrange Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
but had made Young again, and
given them Vigour. He ſaid he had tryed
the Experiment upon the Marquis <hi>Del
Monte,</hi> who ſhewd thereupon anextream
Vigour in the Combat of Love, and
aſſured the Queen, that the Marquis (tho'
he were 60 Years old) had never more
Vigour than at that time. He needed
ſay no more to ſet the Queen on fire.
This <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mountebank, knew ſo well
how to perſwade her, that ſhe would
have this Secret at any rate. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd
that he would never teach it to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Perſon, but that he would furniſh
her with a Doſe which ſhould be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to keep by her without revealing his
Secret, becauſe Her Majeſty being the
moſt Generous Queen in the World,
would make no difficulty of teaching it
to a great many People, and for his part
this Arcanum was all the Treaſure he
had. At laſt the Queen being eager,
promis'd him ten thouſand Crowns for
his Secret, upon Condition he ſhould go
immediately out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:54799:62"/>
no more. But he every Day rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
his Price higher and higher, and the
Marquis <hi>Del Monte</hi> who intended to have
his Share herein, perſwaded the Queen
by any means not to let this Secret e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape,
and the thing was carry'd ſo far,
that he was offer'd thirty thouſand
Crowns. But Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> having
underſtood it, was all over in a cold
Sweat at ſo great a Sum; for the Queen
was ready to have given him a Bill up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Bank of <hi>Santo Spirito,</hi> which was
engaged for Payment, or would have
put her Jewels into his Hands for Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>One Day being among her Maids, as
they were combing her Head, ſhe ſaid,
<hi>I will put my ſelf into the Mode now more
than ever; my Secret will be vhemently
deſired by ſome People, and rejoyce others.
I hope in God to live yet longer than I have
liv'd, to a large extent of Years, and to ſee
a dozen Popes more. Then I ſhall tell them
a great many things which I can aſſure them
I have ſeen, tho' Cardinal</hi> Ricci <hi>ſaid of
me,</hi> 
               <hi rend="margQuotes">The Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> eats a great
deal, and digeſts but little, becauſe
ſhe does not chew it well; and this
will haſten her Death. And now the
old Fool is dead himſelf, but as for</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:54799:62"/>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">me I ſhall live a long time;</hi> and other
ſuch like things. But all theſe fine Hopes
preſently vaniſh'd; for Cardinal <hi>Azzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lini,</hi>
with an hundred Piſtols, ſent this
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Man out of <hi>Rome,</hi> tho' himſelf
afterward ſhewed a Weakneſs of the
like kind, in his laſt Sickneſs, where he
would have given two thouſand Crowns
for a Pill compoſed by the Marquis <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marquis <hi>Del Monte</hi> loſt a Gud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> flight, but he had
many other Supplies, being accuſtom'd
to live upon Rapine. The Charge of
Captain of the Queens Quarter or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier,
furniſh'd him continually with new
Means of getting Money; But Play
ſwallow'd up all. When he was in
Debt he would appear before the Queen
with a Melancholy Air, and ſhe demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the reaſon of his Sadneſs, he would
tell her with admirable Addreſs, That
he had loſt at Play. She ſaw him thus
oftner than he really had Play'd, and
would give him Bills from thirty to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Piſtols, more or leſs, according as it
happened. For the Queen reſerv'd a
certain Sum <hi>per</hi> Month, for ſmall Uſes,
and ſometimes ſhe had certain Funds out
of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which ſhe kept in private to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:54799:63"/>
be liberal with, upon occaſion. But
ſhe did not ſo often diſtribute them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Peoples Merits, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the Services done her, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
always by Fancy, and without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction.
The Marquis had caus'd his
Wife and Children to come to <hi>Rome,</hi>
with the Marquis <hi>Mario</hi> his Brother,
and he would have found a great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to maintain ſo numerous a Family,
without his Induſtry, becauſe he had but
very ſmall Funds from his own Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
and no more than thirty Crowns
a Month from the Queen. 'Tis true
that the other Advantages which he had
from this Princeſs came to as much more,
for ſhe paid the Hire of his Lodgings,
kept him a Coach, gave him alſo many
Priviledges and Exemptions of Cuſtoms
of Goods, and many other things.</p>
            <p>This Marquis who had a mind to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
his Houſe at the Expence of ſuch as
retir'd into the Queens Quarter, had a
thouſand Intrigues with the Jews; and
it would be tedious to reckon up all
the Stories of the Cheats he put upon
them.</p>
            <p>I will only mention one, whereby he
got a great many good Pictures, without
disburſting one Farthing. He had a Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:54799:63"/>
whom they call'd the <hi>Liegeois,</hi> as
being of the Country of <hi>Liege,</hi> who had
not much Wit, though he was a Man
of Subſtance. He had an Acquaintance
with ſome <hi>Flemiſh</hi> Painters, who were
able Men at their Art., from whom he
had very valuable Pictures, becauſe they
were Originals, for Cloaths, the Hire
of his Houſe, and a little ready Money.
He had bought a little Houſe at <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara,</hi>
within the Queen's Juriſdiction,
or Franchiſes, and it had a little Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
well Cultivated, full of Flowers and
Fruits; and among other things, with
fine Oranges and Limons in Veſſels of
Earth, which were the Delight of this
poor Man. The Marquiſs went to him,
and demanded this Houſe in the Queen's
Name, to lodge a <hi>Swediſh</hi> Gentleman
in, who was one of the Queen's Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and was then at <hi>Rome.</hi> The <hi>Liege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ois</hi>
at firſt refuſed this Demand; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
threatned with ill Treatment, he
preſented a Petition to the Queen, who
had no regard at all to it, but on the
contrary, forc'd him to give the <hi>Swede</hi>
the beſt Room in his Houſe. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
went to ſee him often, and the
Flowers and Fruits in his Garden.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:54799:64"/>
This pierced the poor Proprietor to
the Quick; and to redeem himſelf out
of this Vexation, he threw himſelf at
the Marquiſs's Feet, who promiſed him
to Diſlodge the <hi>Swede,</hi> provided he
would lend him four of his beſt Pictures
to take Copies of. You ſhall not only
Copy them, ſaid the Taylor, but I will
give you the Originals with all my heart,
provided you will grant me your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
The Marquiſs Embracing him,
promiſed him he would, and Diſlodged
the <hi>Suede,</hi> who was however juſt upon
his departure out of the Country. By
this Trick, the Marquiſs got four Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Pictures, which might be worth
about 12 or 14 Piſtols a piece; and
ſometime after, he deſir'd four more,
only to Copy, which he promis'd to
reſtore, without performance, deferring
it ſo long till the <hi>Liegeois</hi> Died; and his
Heirs could never regain them: For
not long after, the Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte</hi>
made a Voyage into <hi>Sueden,</hi> where he
ſtaid a long time, and at his retnrn al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
Preſcription, and would never
hear them talk'd of any more.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time he was preparing
his Chambers for the Taylor's Pictures,
he contriv'd to fill his Cellar with good
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:54799:64"/>
Wine for nothing. There was a cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Rogue named <hi>Gaſpar,</hi> a Joyner by
Trade, who wanted the Marquiſs's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
which he bought to the Price
of 80 Barrels of excellent Wine, and
it coſt nothing either to the one or the
other. He had a Friend, one of the
Queen's <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> call'd <hi>Melchior,</hi> who was
a Serjeant, and kept a Cabaret or place
to ſell Wine at <hi>Langara,</hi> where he had
a good Trade by the Refugees and other
wicked People, who retir'd into the
Queen's Franchiſes, becauſe they would
not pay their Debts, or to avoid Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for their Crimes. <hi>Melchior,</hi> who
was as great a Cheat as <hi>Gaſpar,</hi> went
with his Comerade, into the Villages
about <hi>Rome,</hi> where the beſt Wines in
the Country grow, as at <hi>Freſcati, Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,
Genſano, Tivoli,</hi> and others, where
they bought 300 Barrels of Wine, at
half a Piſtol a Piece to be paid in <hi>Rome,</hi>
paying only a little Money in Earneſt,
to cover the Cheat. The Marquiſs, as
we have ſaid before, had 80 Barrels of
the beſt Wine <hi>Albano</hi> afforded; <hi>Gaſpar</hi>
had twenty Barrels, and <hi>Melchior</hi> the
reſt to ſell by Retail. And the Merchants
doubted nothing for three or four
Months, but afterward came to <hi>Rome</hi>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:54799:65"/>
to demand Payment. At firſt they gave
them good words, to draw the thing
at length, and hop'd to tire them by
ſending them ſo often back without
doing any thing. They Addreſſed
themſelves to Cardinal <hi>Azzolini,</hi> who
ſhrugg'd up his Shoulders, and advis'd
them to preſent a Petition to the Queen,
which they did, but they loſt a great
deal of time, becauſe the Queen was
very often not to be ſeen. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
who was willing to have Juſtice
done, favour'd them all he could with
the Queen. She ſent the Petition to the
Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte,</hi> and order'd him, as
Captain of the Queen's Quarter, to ſee Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
given to theſe poor Merchants.
This was to make him Judge of his own
Cauſe; and he ordered it accordingly,
for he gave them nothing but good
Words, and appointed ſeveral days of
Payment, one after another: At laſt for
Form ſake, he called the Debtors before
him, in the preſence of the Creditors;
ſometimes they denied the Debt, and
ſometimes quarrel'd with the Price and
the Quality of the Wine, pretending
they had been Cheated. At laſt, one
of the boldeſt of the Merchants preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Petition to the Pope; and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:54799:65"/>
underſtanding it, perſwaded the
Queen not to hear them, becauſe they
had Affronted him, in recurring to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Juſtice beſides his own. Upon a
ſecond Petition to the <hi>Pope,</hi> his Holineſs
ordered the Governor of <hi>Rome</hi> to ſee
good Juſtice done; and thereupon the
Joyner was taken out of the Queen's
Quarter, and put into Priſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inſolvent, he came out at three
Months end, by liſting himſelf for a
Soldier. The Goods of the <hi>Swiſſe</hi> were
Seiz'd in <hi>Execution,</hi> and ſold by the
Queeen's Permiſſion; and he was oblig'd
to ſerve a Year without Wages. So
that with this and ſome Money the
Queen gave in Charity, the Merchants
were paid ſome well, ſome ill, and ſome
ſcarce any at all.</p>
            <p>The Marquiſs being got out of this
untoward Buſineſs, thought of nothing
elſe but Diverting himſelf; and the
Franchiſes of the Queen's Quarter fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
him every day with an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of ſatisfying his irregular Paſſion
for Women. For thoſe whom Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery
had cauſed to retire thither,
were oblig'd to abandon themſelves to
him, that they might have permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to proſtitute themſelves to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:54799:66"/>
When they were afraid of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or too great in Number, he was
contented with a Preſent, to let them
ſtay in the Queen's Quarter. And you
might frequently ſee Maids, who run
away thither from their Father's Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
and Wives that forſook their Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
Beds, to live publickly in a Crime,
without fear of being Puniſh'd, ſo that
our <hi>Barbon</hi> got Money by them, and
might produce them to his Friends. He
ordinarily kept Company with Prince
<hi>Columberi,</hi> who was the Town-Bull of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and let him know the fine things,
and pleaſant Recreations of the Queen's
Quarter. This great Prince, who was
very Accompliſh'd, had no other fault,
but that he was addicted to Women:
But having too great a Soul to approve
the Cheats of the Marquiſs, he was yet
very glad to ſee by his means, freſh
Women as often as he pleas'd, to amuſe
himſelf withal. For indeed, the Great
Lords do not know for the moſt part
how to ſpend their time, when they are
neither exerciſed in War or Hunting.
Though he was far from being Liberal,
he never Cheated any body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no not ſo
much as one ſingle Perſon; and if he
did not pay them in Money, furniſh'd
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:54799:66"/>
them with Wine, Wheat and Coals. For
having a great deal of Land in and about
<hi>Rome,</hi> he did not always receive his
Rents in ready Caſh, and therefore it
was more commodious for him to pay
rather in Proviſions than Money; reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the latter, only for new Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
To theſe he would give only a
<hi>Teſtoon</hi> of about the value of Eighteen
pence, never more nor leſs; for he was
not of their Humour, who ruine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by Women, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
do. And indeed, the great number
of thoſe he dealt withal, made him put
a low Price upon them, and he found his
Account much better among the Leſſer,
than with the Great Ladies, who are not
to be enjoy'd without great Expences;
for he was not ſo blind to ſacrifice his
Intereſts to his Pleaſures. As the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
his Wife had forſaken him, he was
not of a Complexion to forſake the Sex,
but therefore gave himſelf up to Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and would taſte of all, without
ſetting any Bounds to himſelf. No Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
'ſcap'd him that had any Dealings
of that kind, and he was welcome every
wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by reaſon of his Birth and the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he was
well made, and very well provided with
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54799:67"/>
the Talents of Nature, and principally
thoſe appropriated to the Pleaſures of
<hi>Venus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although his Prince would ſee many
Women, yet he had but one which he
conſtantly kept; to this he paid his
Reſpects, and no body durſt touch her
for fear of being Murther'd upon the
leaſt Signal, by ſome of his Bravo's, of
which he had always twenty at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.
She I am going to ſpeak of, was
Daughter to a certain Widow named
<hi>Manchol.</hi> Prince <hi>Columbieri</hi> did as many
of the long Robe do at <hi>Rome,</hi> who not
being able to Contain, are obliged to
make a fair Appearance, and chuſe out
a poor Maid, ſuch as they like beſt,
both for Beauty and other Reſpects,
and keep her at a diſtance from them,
paying her Lodging with a Salary of
nine or ten Crowns a Month, where
they recreate and themſelves as often as
they pleaſe, without permitting her to
ſee any other Company. And this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
having laſted ſome Years, or
till ſuch ſuch time as the Veſtal begins
to grow Old, they put her off to ſome

newly come thither, who Marries
her for a Virgin. After this, ſome of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54799:67"/>
them live Vertuouſly. But they that
cannot forſake their vicious Courſes,
live with their Husbands till ſuch time
as their Debaucheries are diſcover'd,
and then they withdraw into the Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes
of the Queen, or ſome Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
and there live freely, according
to their former manner of life, till ſuch
time as Sickneſs or old Age, diſorders
or quite break it off. There happen'd
one time a villanous caſe of this Nature,
which cries out for Vengeance. One of
theſe ſorts of Maids having Married an
Artizan who was a Stranger, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
in his Art; She left him at three
Weeks end, becauſe he would force her
to live in Order; and therefore ſhe
contrived with her Mother, to deſtroy
her Husband; and the Meaſures being
taken accordingly, one day as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did entertain her Son-in-law in a
Chamber with a long Diſcourſe, her
Daughter brought in a Man at another
door, where on a ſudden they were Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
by the <hi>Sbirries,</hi> who were hir'd
and let in on purpoſe, to carry them all
to Priſon. And there was immediately
a Criminal Proceſs form'd againſt the
Husband, at the requeſt of the <hi>Fiſcal,</hi>
who was alſo gain'd, and the poor Man
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54799:68"/>
was condemn'd to the Gallies for five
Years, for a contented Cuckold, or ſuch
a one as will ſuffer his Wife to be Kiſs'd
in his Preſence for Money, and died in
Miſery at <hi>Civita Veccia,</hi> while his Wife
in the mean time proſtituted her ſelf to
all the People in <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Manchol,</hi> Prince
<hi>Columbieri</hi> had Lodg'd her in a Private
Houſe, but pleaſant, with a fine Garden,
towards St. <hi>Mary Majeure,</hi> where he
furniſh'd her with all things neceſſary.
She had two Daughters, one of which
was called <hi>Menica,</hi> and the other <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi>
The firſt was that which the Prince
Loved: She was one of the fineſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in <hi>Rome,</hi> of a curious Stature, the
turn of her Viſage well made, fine Eyes,
and the fineſt Teeth in the World, an
admirable Neck, and Sung well: In ſhort,
there was no Defect in her Perſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that her left Arm was a little ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
than the right, with a little Hand,
which was ſomething dry. Her Siſter
was a great fat Woman, and of a Swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Complexion. The Prince Charm'd
with his <hi>Menica,</hi> had a fancy to ſhew her
to the Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte,</hi> to challenge
him to ſhew any Woman in the Queen's
Quarter that was comparable to her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:54799:68"/>
All theſe three made a bargain to
bring theſe Girls to walk to the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queting
Houſe of <hi>Farneſe,</hi> at the Gate
of St. <hi>Pancraſs.</hi> The Marquiſs alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to bring his Damoſel, who was
then a ſmall Remblant, or the Leavings
of the Queen's Taylor; yet ſhe was very
Handſome and full of Play, and was
call'd <hi>Roſina.</hi> They came pretty early
to the Banqueting-Houſe, in Coaches
with the Windows ſhut, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of their Mothers. Our three <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nes</hi>
came later, every one in his Coach.
The Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte,</hi> brought a
courſe Dinner, which he had made ready
at the Cabarets of the Gate <hi>Settignana.</hi>
But our Nymphs gave notice to their old
Sweethearts, that if they had ſufficient
Dexterity, to come into the Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſe
without being ſeen, they
would ſteal from them a Moment to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
them in Private. The World is
always full of Waggery, for though
theſe Gentlemen Treated their Damoſels
well, they were mad that they had been
Faithful ſo long, and almoſt died with
longing to Betray them, ſo true it is,
that there is little ſtreſs to be laid upon
theſe kind of Animals. The three Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites,
were the Queens Taylor, a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54799:70"/>
               <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> of her Majeſty, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Taylor of the Place, <hi>d'Eſpagne,</hi> call'd
<hi>Picard,</hi> a very Debauch'd Fellow, no
Novices in the Court of <hi>Venus,</hi> and
who fail'd not to be there according to
the Aſſignation. In the encloſure of the
Vineyard of <hi>Furneſe,</hi> there is a great
and a little Banqueting-Houſe; in the
great one is a large Hall, marvelouſly
built, from whence you may ſee the
Fields as far as the Sea. 'Twas there
the Feaſt was made, and the two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of theſe two Girls Dined with
the Houſe-keeper, and our People di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
themſelves together, each one
embracing his <hi>Cloris.</hi> The cunning
Jades counterfeited with admirable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation,
and one would have ſworn
it was the firſt time they had been with
Men. For the <hi>Romans</hi> do know ſo well
how to make themſelves Grave, that
the moſt Debauch'd would paſs for <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretia</hi>'s
by their mein and outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
unleſs they chance to miſtake
when they are heated with Wine and
good Chear. When the Chevalier had
Dined, he took a <hi>Guitar</hi> and Play'd, to
which they Danc'd and Caper'd; and
when they had heated themſelves ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently,
our Seniors went to Sleep, as
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:54799:70"/>
it is the Cuſtom of <hi>Italy</hi> after Dinner,
and gave liberty to the Girls to walk
in the Porch. But they impatient to ſee
their ancient Gallants again, Detatch'd
themſelves out one after another, and
went to find them in the little Banquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Houſe,
carrying ſome remainders of
the Dinner, and ſome Bottles of Wine
half empty along with them. Theſe
new Comers had ſome Advantage of the
Regale, while their good Mothers ſtood
Centry. This was not the firſt time
they had been at the ſame Rendezvouſe;
for they were ſo well acquainted, that
they knew every Creek and Corner, and
nick'd their Opportunity, becauſe the
Moments are there Precious.</p>
            <p>But in the midſt of all the Joy, our
Seniors awak'd and demanded their
Nymphs. Their Mothers called them,
but that did not avail, for they were
ſo impatient, that they could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to Search after them. But in the
interim, the <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> and the
two Taylors ſlip'd away cunningly, and
leap'd over the Wall into the Queen's
Garden below, going as ſoftly as they
could through the Thickets and Bruſhes.
The Girls were found Blood-red and all
in an Heat; and our Seniors, who were
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54799:69"/>
old experienc'd Gameſters, got Ladders
and look'd over the Wall, to ſee if they
could perceive the Tracts of any Body.
The Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte,</hi> who knew
the place beſt, diſcover'd the Matter
by ſome prints of their Feet, but had the
Diſcretion to ſay nothing, and to tell
them on the contrary, that it was a falſe
Alarm. They Diverted themſelves to
the full<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>till the Evening, or rather the
Night came; and they had no ſooner
retir'd, but the Marquiſs told all to the
Queen, who was ready to die with
Laughing, and ſaid there was no truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Beaſts without Tails: Thoſe were
her very words.</p>
            <p>Love and Debauchery though they
were a great part, were not the only
buſineſs of the Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte,</hi> for
at the ſame time he had a regard to his
Intereſts; for his Affairs being but in an
untoward poſture, he took all occaſions
to better them, and therefore demanded
his Tribute from thoſe who ſhelter'd
themſelves in the Queen's Quarter. He
help'd the Merchants as much as he
could to Cheat the Cuſtom-Houſe of all
ſorts of Merchandize. A Caſhier of
the Mount of <hi>Piety,</hi> run away into the
Queen's Quarter with a Strumpet call'd
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:54799:69"/>
               <hi>Iſabella,</hi> and three Thouſand Crowns he
had Robb'd the Bank of, was ſent away
ſome days after in the Queen's Coach,
as far as the Confines of the Realm of
<hi>Naples,</hi> by the means of a Preſent of
two Hundred Piſtols he made the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs.
Some time after, one of the
Caſhiers of the Bank <hi>de Spirito Santa,</hi>
named <hi>Paterno,</hi> fled into the Queen's
Quarter with ten Thouſand Crowns in
Gold and Silver, which he had Cheated
the Bank of; the Marquiſs conducted
him in the Queen's Coach, as far as
<hi>Mantua,</hi> for the Sum of 2000 Crowns.
This Wretch went to <hi>Hamburgh</hi> to
<hi>Teixere,</hi> upon the Marquiſs's Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
where he died in the Flower
of his Age, having ſhortned his Life by
Debaucheries and vicious Courſes.</p>
            <p>When the Debauch'd Monks had a
mind to divert themſelves with Publick
Women, they commonly came to the
Caberets of Port <hi>Settignana,</hi> where they
were cover'd from Juſtice and the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of their Superiors. The Marquiſs
always found a Seat at their Table, and
perhaps ſomething elſe at the end of
the Feaſt. And indeed he let no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
ſlip, to make his Advantages up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Chapter of Intereſt and Love.

But however, he was ſometimes miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
as may be ſeen in the following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Piemontois</hi> Lady, the Wife of a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
in that Country, I know not for
what reaſon, went away from her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and came to the Queen, diſguis'd
under a falſe Name. Her Husband
being angry that his Wife had left
him, or rather her Parents complain'd
to the Duke of the ill Uſage of her
Husband, and moved his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ſend after her to Stop her. This
was done, but it prov'd too late; for
having always the wind of the Purſuers,
ſhe came to <hi>Rome</hi> without any Obſtacle,
and went directly into the Queen's
Quarter. The Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Notice of it, did not fail to Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
himſelf, and went readily to wait
upon her. She was one of the fineſt
of a brown Complexion, the Court of
<hi>Savoy</hi> had. This Lady ſeeing her ſelf
under the neceſſity of having a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
recommended her ſelf to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
<hi>Del Monte,</hi> who brought her to
the Queen. Her Majeſty ſeeing a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſo fine, well Shap'd, and of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Quality, had all the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and regard for her poſſible. But
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:54799:72"/>
in the interim, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had
wrote to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Francis
Barberini,</hi> Dean of the Sacred College.
The <hi>Pope</hi> at that time would take no
cognizance of it himſelf, but ſpoke to
Cardinal <hi>Barberini</hi> to Addreſs himſelf to
the Queen about it; which was difficult,
becauſe this Princeſs was angry that the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had not ſent to her. The
<hi>Savoyard</hi> Lady ſeeing ſo many Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
People at work to force her back
to her Husband, caſt her ſelf at the
Queen's Feet, humbly begging her to
take Compaſſion of her, becauſe her
Husband was the Cruelleſt of Men; and
if ſhe ſhould be conſtrained to return
to him again, he would certainly make
an end of her Life. Cardinal <hi>Barberini</hi>
came to the Queen under pretence of a
Viſit, and falling into Talk about the
<hi>Piemontois</hi> Lady, he exhorted the Queen
to reſtore her to her Parents. The Queen
who knew that Cardinal <hi>Barberini</hi> had
receiv'd a Letter from the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi>
deſir'd to know, her ſelf ſeeming
ignorant of the Matter, why he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
himſelf about this Lady, ſeeing
nobody had as yet addreſſed themſelves
to her upon that account. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
anſwer'd, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:54799:73"/>
doing him the Honour to Write about
certain Affairs, had deſir'd him in the ſame
Letter, that if he knew the Lady was
at <hi>Rome,</hi> as he was aſſur'd ſhe was, he
would oblige her to retrrn to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and had given his word upon the
Faith of a Prince, that her Husband
ſhould treat her with all ſort of good
Uſage, and would take the trouble up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
himſelf to compoſe the Difference
betwixt them. The Queen Anſwer'd
him, that when ſhe had the ſame Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
ſhe would reſtore her, and that
in the mean time, ſhe has promis'd her
Protection, and that ſhe would deliver
her to no Body, but ſuch Hands where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Lady might truſt her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſelf with
all manner of Security. Hereupon the
Cardinal replied, that he thought her
Majeſty would have been ſatisfied upon
his ſingle word; that delay in a thing
of this Nature, would but exaſperate her
Husband; that he would intreat the Queen
to conſider that the Lady's being in a
particular Houſe, look'd a little ſtrange;
and if her Majeſty would acquieſce ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in his Opinion, or moſt humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
he would take care to put her
into a Convent. Hereupon the Queen
began to be hot, and demanded whether
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:54799:73"/>
he would put her into the <hi>Sculetta,</hi> or
St. <hi>Jaques,</hi> in the company of Whores;
for 'tis there Married Women are ſhut
up who are Surpriz'd in thoſe kinds of
Gallantries. <hi>Barberini</hi> was hot alſo in
his Turn, for being every whit as Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate
as the Queen, he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
telling her, that he knew he had
given her Majeſty good Counſel, and
that perhaps they would make but a bad
bargain of the Matter. Upon this, the
Queen was downright angry, and after
many words and a great deal of courſe
Language between them, call'd <hi>Barberini
Vecchio Matto,</hi> Old Fool, and conducted
him quite out of hearing with thoſe
words. <hi>Barberini</hi> made no other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
but <hi>Vecchioſi, ma matto no.</hi> I am
Old, 'tis true, but I am no Fool for all
that. But afterwards <hi>Azzolini</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
himſelf, the <hi>Pope</hi> made a Noiſe,
the Lady was Reſtor'd, and at laſt of
all, the Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte</hi> got nothing
for his Pains.</p>
            <p>The Marquiſs was not the only Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
that diverted himſelf, but others
manag'd their Intrigues with greater
ſecrely, and did not give ſo great a Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal:
But above all, there was none that
manag'd their Affairs with ſo much pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:54799:74"/>
as Count <hi>Boccabella</hi> the Queen's
Groom. He was a Man of a fine Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but groſs, deform'd, ſtufft up, of
a very amorous Complexion, and one
that ſlipp'd no occaſion of ſatisfying his
Senſuality. Inſtead of dividing his Love,
as formerly, among many Perſons of
different Humors and Tempers, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd,
in the Inſtance I am now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, to re-unite his wandring Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and fix them all upon a ſingle
Object; but inſtead of a Maid, who
had been at perfect Liberty to diſpoſe
of her ſelf, he took away a Marry'd
Wife, and carry'd her off in this
manner:</p>
            <p>The Climate of <hi>Italy,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Rome,</hi> is ſo hot, that 'tis no wonder
if all the People there are inclin'd to
Love: The Women, above all, when
they follow their own Inclination, and
ſuffer themſelves to be guided by the
Dictates of corrupt Nature, are moſt
addicted to it. Their Diet contributes
not a little thereunto: For, becauſe they
pretend that Water is crude and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſom,
the Women and Maids drink
as much, nay, more Wine than the
Men, without making any Ceremony
upon the matter, and eſpecially the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:54799:74"/>
Vulgar. Beſides this, they eat very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Leeks, Onions, and Garlick, which
they ſwallow down like Sweet-meats:
Cellery, Feunel, Artichoaks, Muſhroms,
Trouſles, Spiceries, and, in a word, all
ſorts of Aliments which are hot and
provocative, are their Delight; and
there are but very few to be found there,
that have any extraordinary Appetite
for things tending to Mortification.
'Tis true, they are kept up very cloſe;
but becauſe things forbidden make us
long after them the more, this conſtraint
is not at all proper to inſpire Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence;
nay, on the contrary, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
for the moſt part, that they are
not accountable for the Honour which
Men dare uot truſt in their hands. But
to ſpeak the truth, there is never ſo
much reaſon to keep them up, as when
Ambaſſadors enjoy the Franchiſes of
Quarters; for when they fly thither, a
Perſon cannot re-call his Child, nor an
Husband his Wife; nay, further, when
a Maid is Marriagable, that is to ſay,
above Twenty Years old, and runs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from her Father's Houſe, and goes
to the Governour or Regiſter, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
that ſeeing her Father and Mother
have not Marry'd her, ſhe will turn
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:54799:75"/>
Courteſan; he gives her his Protection,
and her Parents cannot afterwards keep
her up; on the contrary, they often
exerciſe this infamous Trade before
their Eyes, and they are not able to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them.</p>
            <p>It hapned ill to a Coach-man of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi>
Servant to Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> who
knew not this Cuſtom, though he had
liv'd Twenty four Years in <hi>Rome.</hi> His
Daughter being unfortunately run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from him, to ſet up this hopeful
Occupation, he found out the Place
where ſhe was, and brought her back to
his Houſe, where he laſh'd her ſtoutly;
but this was look'd upon as a Breach of
the Publick Liberty, and Juſtice took
her away again; and if he had not had
good Friends, he had been publickly
chaſtiz'd. This is hard to believe of ſo
Holy a City as <hi>Rome;</hi> but it happens
ſometimes, and they oblig'd to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
ſuch Abuſes, for fear of Spight,
and ſome other Reaſons, which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
will find in the ſequel of this Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>This is certain, that when a Woman
addicts her ſelf to Ill, ſhe always finds
ſome way or other to ſatisfie her Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:

               </gap>n what hapned here
ſome Years ago in a Merchant of <hi>Terre-Sanguina,</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:54799:75"/>
who had a Wife, believ'd to
be the Mirror of Chaſtity; and he
watch'd her narrowly; for as the <hi>Italian</hi>
Nation is very diſtruſtful, he lock'd her
up when he went abroad, and never loſt
ſight of her when ſhe went out, going
along with her both to the Church and
to walk; and yet notwithſtanding all
the care he could take, ſhe fell in Love
with a Young Man that paſs'd often that
way, and made Love to her by Signs,
which is a Language well underſtood
by the <hi>Italians.</hi> She found a way to let
him know, That if he came upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Saturday</hi> at night, he ſhould find
the Gate open at an Hour ſhe told him
of; and to deceive her Husband, ſtaid
while he was in bed. She was no
ſooner come to bed alſo, but ſhe cry'd
out, <hi>O God! Husband, I have no Cravat
nor Sleeves for you to wear to morrow, and
I never thought on't; I muſt riſe again to
waſh and iron them quickly.</hi> The Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
who believ'd ſhe ſpoke truth, let
her do it, and ſlept ſoundly, having been
at work all day by himſelf; for the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
there never put their foot into the
Shop. In the mean time, the Merchant's
Wife comes down, and opens the Door
to her Lover, to whom ſhe proſtituted
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54799:76"/>
her ſelf, and then return'd to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
as if ſhe had but juſt iron'd the
ſmall Linen. Next Morning the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
went to trim himſelf at the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber's,
where was uſually good ſtore of
Company; his Wife's Lover was there
alſo, who not knowing the Merchant,
old all the ſtory of his Adventure with
the Merchant's Wife, whom he had the
Indiſcretion to name: But it coſt him
his Life; for he was Poniarded the ſame
Night ar he went home. Neither did
his Wife ſtay long for the Puniſhment
of her Crime; for as Men dare, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
all things in <hi>Italy,</hi> her Husband
brought her Fruit to eat, which he had
poiſon'd beforehand; and ſhe perceiv'd
nothing 'till the Poiſon began to work
its Effect; and then he reproach'd her
with Unfaithfulneſs, Injuſtice, and Baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and exhorted her to prepare for
Death, acknowledging that he had poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd
her. He ſent for the Curate, and
in the mean time fled away, taking with
him all the Money and Jewels, and what
he could conveniently carry beſides, and
was never more heard of.</p>
            <p>But to return to Count <hi>Boccabella:</hi>
He having an Intrigue with a Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's
Wife, was reſolv'd to carry her
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:54799:76"/>
off; and they agreed together, that it
ſhould be upon a <hi>Wedneſday</hi> in <hi>March,</hi>
when her Husband went to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s
Church, where there was great Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and a grand concourſe of People,
becauſe of the Indulgences given at that
time. As ſhe was going under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns
of the broad Paſſage, call'd St.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Place,</hi> ſhe ſet up a cry, <hi>O my
God! I have loſt my Chaplet of Beads;
but it muſt be fallen near this place; for I
had it as I paſs'd by the Penitentiary.</hi> In
<hi>Italy</hi> the Women always wear a Chaplet
in their Hands when they walk in the
Streets, and are inceſſantly mumbling
over their <hi>Pater-Noſter</hi>'s. Hers was of
Coral, or Granat, with great Silver
Medals. <hi>Stay here,</hi> ſays the poor No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of a Husband, <hi>I will return by and by,
and perhaps I may find it.</hi> This ſweet
Beaſt of a Wife deſir'd him to make
haſte; but as ſoon as ever his back was
turn'd, ſhe advanc'd three or four ſteps
forward, and on the other ſide of the
Columns, ſhe found one of the Queen's
Coaches, into which ſhe ſtept, and was
carry'd to <hi>Longara</hi> to Count <hi>Boccabella,</hi>
where ſhe ſtay'd as long as he liv'd, the
Count's Domeſticks knowing not one
word of it. They only wonder'd that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54799:77"/>
their Maſter eat all alone; that he ſerv'd
himſelf, and carefully lock'd the Door
after him; that he conſum'd as much
Meat as wou'd ſerve two; and, that
there was no body entred into his Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which was call'd The Noble, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he kept his Fair One enclos'd
there. But when the thing was once
become cuſtomary, they took it for Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
which caus'd the Admiration in
ſome meaſure to ceaſe.</p>
            <p>It is ſurprizing that this Woman
ſhould live ſo many Years in Adultery,
without ſpeaking to any body, and
without the leaſt ſence of Religion.
Count <hi>Boccabella</hi> died ſuddenly of an
Apoplexy, at a time when he thought
leaſt of it, and ſome ſay in the very
Act, and that he was drawn off by force:
A fit End for ſuch a Life! But one
would never have imagin'd ſuch a thing
of a Man that pretended to be a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votee,
and was a Member of one of
the Principal Fraternities of <hi>Rome,</hi> I
mean that which wears a particular
Mark upon their Garments, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
all manner of Spiritual Exerciſes.
But howſoever the thing were, never
was Woman in ſo great a Perplexity;
for as ſoon as it was known he was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:54799:77"/>
dead in that manner, there was a great
Alarm in the Houſe, and the Woman
was in ſuch a confuſion and conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ſhe knew not what to do: But when
ſhe had recover'd herſelf a little, ſhe ſent
to find out the Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte,</hi> and
falling upon her knees, with Tears tric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling
down, beſought him to procure
the Queen's Protection for her.</p>
            <p>This Princeſs being inform'd of the
Accident, hindred Juſtice from taking
cogniſance of the matter, and the rather,
becauſe he was one of her Domeſticks,
and dead in her Quarter. The Corps
of the Count was carry'd to the Pariſh-Church
of St. <hi>Dorothy,</hi> and there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd
without any Ceremonies. And
as for this miſerable Woman, the Queen
put her among the Penitents, where ſhe
entred voluntarily, chuſing to be ſhut
up there, rather than return to her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
from whom ſhe had no reaſon to
expect a kind Reception, after ſuch an
injury to his Bed. The Marquiſs, who
would do nothing but upon Intereſt,
pretended to obtain ſome Favours for
his Pains; but ſhe was ſo afflicted, ſhe
could not ſo much as hear him, and ſo
he paſs'd it by, having otherwiſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
to recompence himſelf: But he
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54799:78"/>
did ſo many Exploits and injurious
things, and the Complaints againſt him
came ſo faſt to the Queen, that ſhe was
oblig'd to turn him out, at leaſt in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
from being Captain of her
Quarter, and to give it to Count <hi>Vaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau,</hi>
who was Captain of her <hi>Suiſs</hi>
Guards.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Vaſenau</hi> was Natural Son to
<hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and a <hi>Poliſh</hi>
Damoſel: He had a delicate and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
Wit, a Soul fill'd with Greatneſs
and Integrity; and you might ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Noble in all his Manners, which
correſponded to the Nobility of his
Birth; but he had nothing handſome in
his Face; which however is no mighty
Fault in a Man's Phiſiognomy. He
cloath'd ſo fine (for he follow'd none but
the Modes of <hi>France,</hi> of which he had
generally the firſt notice) that the moſt
Genteel Perſons did always imitate him;
but commonly adding ſomething of their
own, ſpoil'd what was good in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
of the others. He had a <hi>German</hi>
Gate, and was a little heavy on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
which made ſome People difficult
to believe that he was ſo perfect at the
Exerciſes of the Body as he was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to be. I ſhould eaſily agree to his
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:54799:78"/>
Bravery; and there are none but thoſe
who are either malicious or miſinform'd,
and have been at <hi>Madrid</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> that
can diſpute it; and there is none of
them perhaps will ſay they had meaſur'd
Swords with him, as the <hi>Gaſcon</hi>
Captain, who was in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Service,
did. His great Patience in ſuffering
Affronts, which paſs'd for Inſenſibility
and Cowardiſe, has given occaſion to
ſome to form injurious Sentiments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him: But however, it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
inſensibility in a Man to ſuffer; it
is Prudence to diſſemble that, which the
neceſſity of Affairs will not ſometimes
permit him to revenge. If Fortune had
not been addicted to perſecute the
Count, without doubt he had took fire
as ſoon as another upon the leaſt Injury
done him. If he was at any time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſant
towards a Perſon, it was rather
out of Policy than Baſeneſs of Mind:
Nor was it that he lov'd the making of
his Fortune more than his Fame; for
we do not ſee that he made any great
Buſineſs of the Queen's Service, which
he might have done perhaps, if he had
not had ſo nice a Conſcience. 'Tis well
known what Temptations were offer'd
him by a Jew of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> who was
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:54799:79"/>
gain'd by the Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte,</hi> to
corrrupt him when he went into <hi>Sweden</hi>
to receive the Queen's Revenues, as we
ſhall find in the enſuing Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>Having loſt the King his Father,
when as yet he had done nothing for
him, he took a Fancy to travel to the
Northern Parts by his own Natural
Inclination; but they perſwaded him,
and that with Reaſon, that he might
find that elſewhere which was not to
be found amongſt them. He paſſed
firſt into <hi>England,</hi> where he had the
Honour to inſinuate himſelf into the
Favour of King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
ſeveral Obligations from him;
but he was not long there; for he
happen'd into ſome Quarrels, which
oblig'd him to repaſs ſuddenly into
<hi>Holland,</hi> where Fortune did not declare
her ſelf in his Favour: So he went
into <hi>Spain,</hi> and had good Succeſs at the
firſt; for his Air and Manners being
very agreeable, gave him an Entrance
into all Places; and his way of Addreſs
pleas'd many, and particularly <hi>Don
John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi> declared himſelf in his
Favour. But a certain Gallantry he
had with a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Lady, brought him
into freſh Trouble, ſo that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:54799:79"/>
for his own Safety to depart
out of the Eſtates of the Crown of
<hi>Spain.</hi> From thence he came into
<hi>France,</hi> where he found a good Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment,
and a Fortune worthy of
himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſimir</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> after his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
choſe <hi>France</hi> preferrably to
all others to paſs the reſt of his days in.
This Religious Prince took Count <hi>Vaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau</hi>
near his Perſon, and beſtow'd ſo
many Kindneſſes upon him that he was
quickly envied. And ſome, even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Rank of Princes, would have
ſupplanted him at the ſame time the
King of <hi>Poland</hi> thought to advance him.
And for this purpoſe, becauſe the King
would go upon ſure grounds, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
to acknowledge him for his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew
in the Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> but
however it was not difficult to turn
this inconſtant Prince from his Deſign,
or at leaſt to cauſe him to deferr the
Execution of it.</p>
            <p>And it was deferr'd ſo long, that in
the <hi>Interim</hi> the King died in the Abbey
of St. <hi>Germain de pre,</hi> ſo that theſe good
Projects quickly vaniſhed; and inſtead
of an Eſtabliſhment, he was forc'd to be
content with a ſmall Matter the Prince
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:54799:80"/>
of <hi>Conde</hi> gave him, of what the King
left at his Death. Afterwards he came
to <hi>Rome</hi> to Queen <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> who own'd
him for one of her Family, and put him
into the number of her Domeſticks.
Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> and the Marquiſs,
who were afraid of theſe Marks of
Diſtinction, would willingly have
ſeen him far enough of, ſuſpecting that
this Kinſman and New-comer would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the chief Favourite, and obtain
the higheſt Reward.</p>
            <p>However they made fair Weather
to him at firſt, though in the mean
time they thought of nothing more than
how to get rid of him. The Queen
made him Captain of her <hi>Swiſs Guards,</hi>
and a little while after Captain of her
Quarter. But he had this laſt Charge
only in appearance; for the Marquis
perform'd all the Functions of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
ſo that we ought not to impute
thoſe diſorders to the Count, which
afterwards happen'd in the Queen's
Quarter.</p>
            <p>He ſpent his firſt two or three Years
in great Tranquillity, and without any
thing remarkable except ſome ſmall
petty Amours: Madam <hi>de Chalais</hi>
was the firſt of his Inclinations; but
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:54799:80"/>
ſeeing ſhe was enclos'd in a Convent of
Nuns of St. <hi>Mary,</hi> or of the Viſitation
at <hi>Langara,</hi> this was only an Amour of
an Iron-Gate. I have ſeen him often
in a Moon-ſhine Night playing upon a
Violin, which he had in his Pocket,
round about the Walls of the Cloiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r;
and at the ſound of certain Airs, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
de <hi>Chalais</hi> would ſhew a ſmall Light
in her Apartment on the Garden-ſide,
where the Count having found a way
to enter, made Love to her afterward
by Signs. They had ſeen one another
in <hi>Spain,</hi> when the Prince of <hi>Chalais</hi>
retir'd thither by reaſon of the Troubles
he had in <hi>France;</hi> and the Count had a
Company of the Regiment of <hi>Chalais</hi>
in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Service. The Duke <hi>de
Poli</hi> entred into a ſtricter Tye of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with him than any other, and they
made a little League between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to uphold one another with the
Queen; nevertheleſs the Count dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
made his Court to Cardinal <hi>Az<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olini,</hi>
who treated him with a great
deal of Civility, Ceremonies of which
the <hi>Italians,</hi> and above all the Courtiers
are no way ſparing.</p>
            <p>This Union of the Count with the
Duke laſted continually, and ſo much
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:54799:81"/>
the more agreeably on the Count's part,
for that the Duke of <hi>Poli</hi> had a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
married to another Duke, who paſs'd
for one of the fineſt and moſt charming
Ladies of the Age. She was rarely well
ſhap'd, and of a ſtature good enough:
Her Complection was fine, the Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of her Face were agreeable, and
ſhe had the whiteſt Teeth in the World.
Her Mouth was a little large, her Eyes
black, lively, and well defended; Her
Complection was very beautiful and
uniform; Her Hair curl'd and brown,
a fine Neck, and indeed her whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
had an Air of Quality. She ſung di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
well, and underſtood Muſick
perfectly, and touch'd all ſorts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
moſt excellently. She was
then in the Flower of her Youth, about
20 or 22 Years of Age, and as ſhe was
often in the Converſation of the Duke
her Father, the Count had ſeen her a
long time before he fell in Love with
her. She charm'd all the Company
that heard her play upon the Baſe Viol,
as much as any Maſter of Muſick could
do; which did facilitate the Conqueſt
of his Heart to ſo rare and beautiful a
Perſon as the Dutcheſs was, ſo that in
a little time he became deſperately in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:54799:81"/>
Love. His Air, his Manners, and his
Eyes did all denote him in a ſtrong Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
but a certain Reſpect, and Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſs,
hinder'd him from declaring
himſelf. He therefore endeavoured to
do that by another, which he durſt not
do by himſelf. And to this purpoſe he
caſt his Eyes upon a Taylor which made
the Dutcheſſes Cloaths, and he was a
Man proper for a Confident. He was Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet
and Bold, Prudent and Ingenious,
Qualities neceſſary to the Conduct of an
Amorous Intrigue. He did it with
Succeſs, and as theſe ſort of Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
find an Entrance every where, he
made no great difficulty to acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
of his Commiſſion, and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
render'd himſelf neceſſary,
both to the one and the other, without
being ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>He then ſaw the Dutcheſs the ſame
Day, and gave her an Account of ſome
Love-Matters, without telling her from
whence they came, and ſhe heard him ſo
favourably, that he did not conceal the
Name of the Count <hi>de Vaſenau:</hi> The
Lady had already obſerved his Myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Study'd Arts, and did eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he was in Love; ſo ſhe volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
heard the Declaration made to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:54799:82"/>
her by a Perſon well known, and whom
ſhe knew to be in the Count's Intereſts.
She return'd as agreeable an Anſwer as
the Count could wiſh; but added, That
ſhe had Meaſures to guard, for that ſhe
had a Severe Father, and a Jealous Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
who look'd ſtrictly after her.
And thus the Introducer concluded the
Matter without much difficulty.</p>
            <p>All the Secret then was depoſed into
theſe Hands, and he made ſo faithful a
Report to the Count, that he became
more Amorous than before. He ſought
for an opportunity to ſpeak to her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his Introducer, but it was very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to find one, at leaſt to come Head
to Head, or enjoy one of thoſe happy
Moments where he might find her alone.
All that could be done was within the
Circles of the Ladies of <hi>Italy,</hi> that is to
ſay, in caſting ſome Glances by Stealth,
which did not ſatisfie our Paſſionate Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
who believ'd, that the Dutcheſs as
well as himſelf, did not intend only the
Language of the Eyes. But fearing
that ſhe did not ſee one half of his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
he deſired to explain himſelf by
<hi>Billets Deux:</hi> However, the Dutcheſs
being of Opinion that theſe Letters did
often diſcover Intrigues, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:54799:82"/>
had been conceal'd, would never
receive any, for fear they ſhould fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a ſtrange Hand. And indeed ſhe had
Superviſors in the Country, and Spies
ſet over her by others, as well as the
Duke of <hi>Aqua Sparta</hi> her Husband. And
Ambaſſador who had all the Qualities to
pleaſe Ladies, even to Old Age, and had
loſt almoſt nothing of the Beauties and
agreeableneſs of Youth, ſet all Hands
at work to enter into an Intrigue with
the Dutcheſs, and he handled the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſo neatly, that, he was with her at
the Baptizing of a Child of a <hi>French</hi>
Bookſeller, who liv'd in the Place <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vona.</hi>
The Honeſt and Engaging Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments
of this Ceremony, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
every time they ſaw one another,
with abundance of Sweetneſs and Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
Pleaſure. The Duke <hi>D'Etree,</hi>
for 'tis eaſie to ſee that 'tis he I ſpeak of,
made a moſt innocent Amuſement to
pleaſe the Dutcheſs, but withal ſpar'd no
coſt to obtain her favour, and he was ſo
liberal upon all Occaſions, that even
<hi>Daphne</hi> her ſelf would have turn'd
back again, if ſhe had been flying away:
It cannot be thought ſtrange therefore,
if the Dutcheſs did not hate him; but
tho' ſhe was very reſerv'd, ill Tongues
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:54799:83"/>
did ſo envenome all things, that this
Princeſs was baniſht <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſometime
after confin'd by her Husband to one of
his Eſtates; and he was aſſiſted in it by
Cardinal <hi>Baromeo,</hi> and the Princeſs <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boniano</hi>
who were Related to the Duke.
In the mean time the Count's Affair ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd
nothing at all, although his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
was not aſleep; for he let ſlip no
Opportunity to make the Dutcheſs ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Count's Torments. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Introducer would ſpeak his things ſo
agreeably, that ſhe would hear him with
Pleaſure, and as he always mingled ſome
pleaſant things in his Diſcourſe, he
would make her Laugh; ſo that the
Confident had more Pleaſure than the
Lover himſelf. For there was never a
Day in the Week wherein he did not go
to ſee the Dutcheſs under ſome Pretext
or other. The Count would often go
and ride about her Palace mounted upon
an excellent Horſe, Calaſhes being then
not ſo common, for Cardinal <hi>Chigi</hi> firſt
us'd them in imitation of the <hi>French</hi>
Mode. One Night the Count's Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ventur'd to introduce him into the
Dutcheſs's Palace, wrapp'd in a Cloak,
under pretence of an Addreſs to a Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
who was the Lady's Confident, but
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:54799:83"/>
they were greatly aſtoniſh'd to find the
Duke in his Entertaining Chamber.
They ſtrove to hide themſelves in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to avoid meeting him, but to no
purpoſe, for he diſcover'd them as they
were retiring, and was very much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd
to ſee two Men in his Palace at
ſuch an Hour, and in ſuch a place. But
the Taylor who had both Courage and
Dexterity, came up to him, and told
the Duke, That the Dutcheſs h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
him to come to ſpeak with <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſel
Palma,</hi> for ſo was the Maids Name,
to take the Body of a Gown to make
fit, and that the other Man was his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
The good Duke ſearch'd no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into this Affair, but permitted
them to enter where <hi>Palma</hi> was. She
was Aſtoniſh'd to ſee the Count, but
did promiſe and aſſure to ſerve him to
the uttermoſt; nevertheleſs, for want
of being Liberal, his Affairs advanc'd
but ſlowly. Some time after he was in
the Converſation of the Duke of <hi>Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
and there was Singing, with a Sympho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and Conſort of Muſical Inſtruments,
and a Comedy with Marrionnets. That
Night the Count thought he ſhould have
died of Love, for the Dutcheſs was as
Lovely and Fine as an Angel. But while
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:54799:84"/>
theſe things were tranſacting, the Queen's
Affairs being Embroil'd in <hi>Sueden,</hi> her
Majeſty ſent Count <hi>Veſenan</hi> to receive
her Rents, and put things into better
Order. 'Twas then he muſt forſake her
for a long time, and his Sighs and Tears
gave the Dutcheſs an Account of his
Deſpair; and they promis'd each other
to Love eternally: But the Count's
Back was no ſooner turn'd, but ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
him. Being arriv'd in <hi>Sueden,</hi> his
Confident wrote to him every Poſt, and
ſent him News of the Dutcheſs; but
he was not Faithful, becauſe he was
employ'd in another Intrigue between
the Dutcheſs and a Roman Prince of
great Merit. However he was uſeful,
in giving him notice of all the Traps
and Machinations againſt him, which
came to his Knowledge: For the poor
Gentleman had a great deal of Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from the Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte,</hi> who
was enrag'd that he was not ſent in his
Place.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> did what he could
to calm the Queen's Mind, but the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs's
Cabal aggravated it, and <hi>Landi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni</hi>
always entertain'd the Queen with
this Diſcourſe, when ſhe was in an ill
Humour. The Queen of <hi>Sueden,</hi> the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:54799:84"/>
young King's Mother, did him all the
Service ſhe could with Queen <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina;</hi>
but the famous Jew at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi>
call'd <hi>Teixere,</hi> who was in the Intereſts
of the Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte,</hi> becauſe he
had confirm'd his Commiſſion to receive
the Queen's Rents in <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and in
the Dutchy of <hi>Bremen,</hi> which he always
remitted to the Queen by the way of
<hi>Venice,</hi> at great Intereſt. This Perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Man, gain'd by the Marquiſs, made
all things go Croſs, on purpoſe to ruin
and deſtroy the Count. 'Tis true that
he had ſome complaiſance for this <hi>Jew,</hi>
but if they had Robb'd the Queen toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
his Affairs had gone better; but
he had too Generous a Soul, and a Heart
too well fix'd; and in all his Voy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge and
ſtay at <hi>Stockholme,</hi> he comported him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
as a Man of Probity, which in part
was the cauſe of his Ruine; for the
Receivers forſook him, becauſe he made
too ſtrict an Examination of their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.
But that which compleated his
Ruine, was a Letter he writ to the
Queen, wherein he gave her an Account,
that he had found a way to ſave a great
deal of Money in Exchanges, by return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Subſidies by the way of <hi>France,</hi>
and exchanging with the Penſions the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:54799:85"/>
King of <hi>France</hi> gave the <hi>Suedes;</hi> ſo that
whereas ſhe paid Nine <hi>per Cent</hi> by way
of <hi>Venice,</hi> he reckon'd not above Two
or three to make it come by <hi>France.</hi>
This vex'd the Queen afreſh, becauſe it
ſhould ſeem by this Letter that ſhe had
a Commerce with the Miniſter of <hi>France</hi>
in <hi>Sueden.</hi> But he knew not ſhe would
take it ill. After all, the Count return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Rome,</hi> and went to the Queen
with Boots and Spurs on, but ſhe gave
him a very brisk reception, for ſhe
would ſcarce ſuffer him to ſpeak, and
when he did, he was not heard. He
ran to Cardinal <hi>Azzolini,</hi> to beg of him
to interceed with the Queen on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
alledging, that he was oblig'd
to Protect him, becauſe of the good
intelligence that had always been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them. But his Perſecutor the
Marquiſs, repreſented that the Count
was more careful to give the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
an account of Affairs, than he was
to her Majeſty her ſelf. She who had
a Domineering mind, and would play
the Sovereign in all things, took Um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage
at the Count's Proceedings, and
treated him ill upon all occaſions. Nay,
ſhe proceeded to that Exceſs, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
one day ſent for him into her Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:54799:85"/>
and charging him with Injuries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
She in great rage gave him three or four
Blows over the Head with a Cane ſhe
had in her Hand. This poor and much
afflicted Lord went to bed with a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and perfectly deſpair'd to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
treated in this ſort; but he muſt
have Patience, for what could be done
with a Fool that had neither Rhime nor
Reaſon? Neither is he the only Perſon
who has been thus treated, for the
World is full of the Extravagancies of
this Princeſs. But that which gave him
moſt Affliction of all, was the Cheating
and Mockery of the Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte,</hi>
who came to Comfort him, and that
was the cauſe of all the Miſchief that
befell him. The poor Dutcheſs of <hi>Aqua
Sparta</hi> Wept for Grief, and the Count's
Confident was witneſs to her Sorrow:
For notwithſtanding the Count had not
ſeen the Dutcheſs, ſhe had yet ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
for him. His ingenious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
oblig'd her to write a word or
two, to teſtifie that ſhe took a ſhare in
his Diſgraces; And this ſhe did, upon
condition that he would reſtore the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as he punctually did, after he
had kiſs'd it very often wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Tranſport. It was matter of great
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:54799:86"/>
conſolation to him, that ſo lovely a
Perſon was touch'd with his Diſgrace.
The Duke of <hi>Poli</hi> ſent to Viſit him of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and they ſaw one another <hi>incognito;</hi>
and at laſt Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> reconciled
him to the Queen, who made him Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
After the Count had reſpited
a while, he would willingly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
with the Dutcheſs; but beſides
that, he was engag'd, in ſome meaſure,
with the Prince I have ſpoken of alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and would give him no occaſion of
Jealouſie: An unforeſeen Accident broke
all the meaſures of their ancient Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence.
The Queen at the Count's
firſt coming to her, had hung two of
his Chambers with <hi>Damas,</hi> and at his
departure for <hi>Sueden,</hi> had deputed the
Duke of <hi>Poli</hi> to ſerve in his Place, till
his Return. The Duke appropriated
theſe Hangings to himſelf, as coming to
him from the Queen. And the Maſter
of the <hi>Hotel</hi> had put him into ſome hopes
of them, which embroil'd the Matter
further. At laſt the Count perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
demanded the <hi>Damas</hi> from the
Duke, who refns'd to reſtore it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
Preſcription and Poſſeſſion.
Neither of them durſt complain to the
Queen, and the Maſter of the <hi>Hotel</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:54799:86"/>
would diſoblige neither of them. So they
took Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> for Arbitrator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, and he counſelled the Duke
to reſtore them; but he was Obſtinate,
and would keep them. The Queen came
to underſtand it by means of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
her Spy, who lov'd to fiſh in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Waters. She Laugh'd and diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her ſelf with their Diſpute, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
obliging either of them to deſiſt
from their Pretentions. At laſt comes
a Jew and ended the Strife, deſiring the
Duke to reſtore him the <hi>Damas,</hi> which
he prov'd to be his own, or to pay him
for the Hire of it. The Duke reſtor'd
him the <hi>Damas</hi> before the Count, and
neither of them had it. So the Count
loſt both his <hi>Damas</hi> and the favour of
his Lady. So that we ſee Intereſt is
ſometimes ſtronger than Love. The
Dutcheſs expected, that at his return
from <hi>Sueden</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> the
Count would have brought her ſome
piece of <hi>Holland,</hi> or ſome fine <hi>Flanders-Lace:</hi>
But he gave her nothing but
Gugaws, ſmall works of Ivory, and ſome
other things made at <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>remburgh,</hi> which

no ſuch great matter of mingling Blood,
as they do in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> At
laſt the Buſineſs was made up by <hi>Donua
Maria Candida,</hi> a Religious of St. <hi>Cecily,</hi>
and the Abbot <hi>de Cabannes,</hi> Gentleman
to Cardinal <hi>Altieri.</hi> It is Suprizing,
that at a time when the Queen her ſelf
liv'd upon Alms, or a Penſion which the
Pope allow'd her, her Rents not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from <hi>Sueden</hi> becauſe of the War,
that Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> ſhould find Ten
Thouſand Crowns in ready Money, to
Marry <hi>Octavia</hi> to the Marquiſs <hi>Caponi.</hi>
This ſhe had, without reckoning what
ſhe got from the Queen both before and
after this Marriage, which amounted
to more than double the Sum. Fortune
was very favourable to this Girl;
ſeeing that they, who would otherwiſe
have ruin'd it, contributed ſo much the
more to her Preferment. So poor
Count <hi>Vaſenau,</hi> on which Side ſoever
he turn'd him, was always Croſs'd.</p>
            <p>Nor are we yet at the end of his Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes.
For Prince <hi>Radzevil,</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
of <hi>Poland,</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Year
1680, and viſited the Queen in form:
And Madam the Ambaſſadreſs went alſo
to ſee the Queen, who gave her a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Reception, not only in quality of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:54799:87"/>
Ambaſſadreſs, but as one of the Family
of the King of <hi>Poland.</hi> Count <hi>Vaſenau</hi>
ſerv'd as Ambaſſador, and ſhe vigorouſly
recommended him to the Queen. The
Ambaſſador, who was willing to ſerve
the Count alſo, open'd a way to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
to him certain Penſions in the
Realm of <hi>Naples,</hi> which belong'd to the
<hi>Jagellons,</hi> who Reigned ſo long in <hi>Poland,</hi>
of whoſe Family Count <hi>Vaſenau</hi> was the
laſt. The Queen liſtned to this Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and writ into <hi>Spain</hi> to the Duke
<hi>de Medina Celi,</hi> firſt Miniſter to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
King, who was Sovereign of the
Realm of <hi>Naples.</hi> She wrote alſo to
the Marquiſs <hi>Don Velos,</hi> Vice Roy of
<hi>Naples;</hi> and every thing prepared to
favour the Count, if her Vanity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy,
had not ſpoil'd all. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſhe would accept this Obligation
from the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and ſometimes ſhe
would not have it ſaid ſhe ſhould have
begg'd their Favour, being perſwaded
they would find ſome ſly trick or other
not to keep their Words; as indeed
they did, when they had penetrated the
Queen's Intentions: And ſo Count <hi>Vaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau</hi>
was fruſtrated of his fine hopes.</p>
            <p>Sometime after, it happen'd, that the
Queen would raiſe the Marquiſs <hi>Del
Monte</hi> to the Charge of Great Maſter
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:54799:88"/>
of her Horſe, and gave him the Title
of <hi>Excellence,</hi> pretending this way to
Recompence him for the Services he
had done her in <hi>Sueden,</hi> whither he had
accompanied her in her laſt Voyage, and
whither he went afterwards upon the
Queen's Buſineſs; but the Ambaſſadors
and Cardinals, except <hi>Azzolini,</hi> refus'd
to give it him. The Queen hop'd, that
at leaſt the Duke of <hi>Poli</hi> would obey
her Will; but though he was but a
poor Lord, and drew great Subſidies
out of the Queen's Houſe, he choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to quit her Service than ſtoop to
ſo mean a thing. But the Marquiſs
<hi>Del Monte</hi> did not looſe it, for beſides the
Charge of great Maſter, he was made
<hi>Major Domo</hi> of the Queen's Houſe, and
had the profit of both Charges. As for
Count <hi>Vaſenau,</hi> he not only gave him
the Title of <hi>Excellence</hi> without Scruple,
but would likewiſe have given him that
of <hi>Highneſs,</hi> if they would have let him
alone. Upon this, the Marquiſs look'd
upon him with a better Eye, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
he would ſerve him upon all Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.
The Queen alſo made him
more than ordinary Careſſes, becauſe of
his Obedience, and ordered him a Coach
for himſelf all alone, augmenting the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:54799:88"/>
number of his Liveries, which were not
much different from the Queen's; an
Honour the Queen did to no body but
himſelf, as being one of her own Family.</p>
            <p>The Count now finding himſelf a
little at Repoſe, and more Honour'd
than before, fell into an amorous Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,
being content to ſweeten his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
with Madam <hi>Beauregard,</hi> whom
he ſaw every day. But then he left
her in the Lurch, and beſtow'd all his
Courtſhip upon a new Miſtreſs which
he had, without going out of <hi>Langara.</hi>
It was the Dutcheſs of <hi>Salviati</hi> with
whom he was Smitten, and ſhe was of
the firſt Quality, and Allied to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Houſes in <hi>Rome.</hi> She was a very
Handſome Perſon; and when you look
upon her altogether, ſhe was not more
agreeable in Beauty, than in a ſprightly
and charming Wit; for ſhe had great
Accompliſhments in Converſation, and
you would never be weary with hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Diſcourſe, for ſhe reaſoned with
a great deal of Exactneſs and Judgment.
'Tis true, ſhe was ſubject to ſome little
Diſcontents, which took her now and
then, but that did not hinder her in her
<hi>Lucid Intervals,</hi> from being brisk and
ſparkling, and to Charm all thoſe which
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:54799:89"/>
had the happineſs to approach her.
This I ſay, becauſe ſhe communicated
her ſelf only to Perſons of her own
Genius, who knew how to bear her
Converſation, but beſides they muſt
have the gift of managing her, for ſhe
had a Briskneſs that was able to daſh
even thoſe of the beſt Aſſurance. She
was Siſter to <hi>Don Frederick Scorza,</hi> now
Duke of <hi>Caeſarini,</hi> by his Wife's Title.
Count <hi>Vaſenau</hi> found a way to inſinuate
himſelf by honeſt means. For ſhe had a
young Son who was a Comely Youth,
and of great Hope, but becauſe he had
not Travell'd; the Count to make him
an Accompliſh'd Prince, inſtructed him
in many things, ſhewing him how to
Tread well, and take upon him an Air
of Greatneſs, conformable to his Birth,
and to appear Gallant in the Streets.
During the whole Carnaval, he never
left the young Lord; and at the ſame
time, the Dutcheſs went Maſqued in the
Concourſe, in a Magnificent Chair, with
thoſe of her Family and Domeſticks.
The young Prince and the Count were
always at the ſides of them with Masks
on, mounted upon excellent Barbs, which
they made to wheel and Prance with a
Grace. As for the Duke her Husband,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54799:89"/>
he is a Solitary Prince, and does not
love to appear in Publick. The Night
after, having accompanied the Dutcheſs
home, the Count and the young Prince
were at a Ball together all Night, and
paſs'd the time very pleaſantly. Thus
the Count comported himſelf in this
new Intrigue, which nevertheleſs, he
muſt quickly break off: For the old
Dutcheſs Dowager, the Duke's Mother,
a very Severe Princeſs, of great Vertue,
and admirable Conduct, who was afraid
any Body ſhould ſpeak to ſpeak to her,
oblig'd the Count to retire by degrees,
though they ſhewed him great Reſpect.
This old Lady was Siſter to Cardinal
<hi>Cibo,</hi> and ſo great an Enemy to all ſorts
of Intrigues, that when ſhe was young,
ſhe broke the Skull of a pretty Girl
with a Plate, whom her Husband en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
and us'd to ſerve at the Table.
After which ſhe retir'd into a Convent
at <hi>Florence,</hi> and there remain'd till her
Husband's Death. Afterwards ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
to <hi>Rome</hi> to her Sons, where ſhe
took care to ſee every body live in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and according to their ſeveral Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
The Count had other Amorous
Intrigues, beſides thoſe already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd,
with which I am not willing to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54799:90"/>
tire the Reader; but however we may
ſay ſomething perhaps in another place,
if an occaſion preſent it ſelf. I ſhall
make an end of this Article with the
telling you, That after the Death of
Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VIII. he was made one
of the Knights of Honour, to Pope
<hi>Innocent</hi> XI. where he ſubſiſts by the
Pope's Bounty, and a Penſion of 500
Crowns which the Queen left him for
his Life, payable by the Heirs of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Azzolini.</hi> But the Count is not
now the ſame he was heretofore, for
having renounc'd the Vanities of the
World, he practiſeth great Devotion,
and lives a very Exemplary Life, and
worthy of a true Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Since we have begun to note the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of the Queen's Principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
who have ſo great a part in her
Hiſtory, it will not be amiſs to ſee here
the Portraicture of the Duke of <hi>Poli,</hi>
who made the fineſt Figure with this
Princeſs next to Cardinal <hi>Azzolini;</hi> and
afterwards we ſhall ſpeak a word or
two concerning Count <hi>d' Alibert,</hi> whom
ſhe honour'd with her Confidence,
tho' ſhe did not much eſteem him at
firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:54799:90"/>
The Duke of <hi>Poli</hi> was of the Family
of <hi>Conti,</hi> which is one of the Nobleſt and
moſt Ancient in <hi>Rome,</hi> out of which there
has been Eleven Popes. He was a big
Man, very groſs, whoſe Age made him
grow ſtooping. He was certainly a
Lord of Merit, full of Honour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible
Probity, reſerv'd in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
and Phlegmatick to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
point: He would always ſay, that
every thing was brought to paſs with
Patience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He was as ſevere as <hi>Cato;</hi> and
as to his Oeconomy, it would have
been call'd ſparing in another, who had
not been charg'd with ſo great a number
of Children. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> VII. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
him to the Queen to be her <hi>Major-Domo,</hi>
or Firſt Gentleman of her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and ſhe accepted it ſo much the
more readily, becauſe ſhe was ambitious
of having one of the Firſt Gentlemen of
<hi>Rome</hi> in her Service. He behav'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
there with a great deal of Prudence,
but he could not forbear to teſtifie his
Diſpleaſure when he ſaw things done
diſorderly. He was ador'd by all the
Queen's Officers, and reſpected as much
as her ſelf, becauſe of his Probity.
Crown'd Heads did much look upon
him, and their Ambaſſadors came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:54799:91"/>
him, not ſo much for his Birth, as
the Eſteem they had for his Perſon. He
had the good Fortune to marry his El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
Son, who had been one of the
Queens Pages, with the Siſter of the
Conſtable <hi>Colonna,</hi> Widow to the Duke
<hi>de Bazianello.</hi> This Alliance did much
diſpleaſe the Conſtable, who croſs'd it
as much as he could, but could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it. The Widow was indow'd in
Fifteen Thouſand Crowns in Rent,
and the Duke ſuppos'd that both the
Goods and Eſtate, would come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Family with the augmentation
of her Dowry, becauſe ſhe had no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by her firſt Husband. But ſhe was
happier in this ſecond Marriage, for
ſhe had a fair Lineage from the Duke
the <hi>Guadagnoli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Profits the Queen gave to the
Duke of <hi>Poli</hi> were great. She paid the
Hire of his Palace which was near the
Queens, and ſhe kept three Coaches and
Liveries for him. This joyn'd to the
number of Priviledges, Exemptions,
Rights of Entries, and 180 Crowns <hi>per</hi>
Month, made him up 4000 Crowns <hi>per
Annum,</hi> compriſing therein 600 Crowns
for the Dutcheſs of <hi>Poli,</hi> who was firſt
Lady of Honour to the Queen, tho' ſhe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:54799:91"/>
very ſeldom perform'd her Function.
For beſides that, Her Majeſty had other
Ladies and Damſels, ſhe had ſo little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
for her Sex, at leaſt in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
that Women were ſeldom ſeen
with her; and when ſhe went abroad,
ſhe had never any follow'd her. So that
the Dutcheſs of <hi>Poli</hi> went only to the
Queen at good Feaſts, to receive <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors,
Princeſſes,</hi> and <hi>Nieces of Popes</hi>
that came to viſit Her Majeſty. As for
other <hi>Roman</hi> Princeſſes and Dutcheſſes,
as the Queen could give them nothing
but a Cuſhion, without tranſgreſſing the
Law of Ceremonies. So they never
came to ſee her, becauſe they pretended
to greater Honours. The other Viſits
which the Queen receiv'd were from
Ambaſſadors and Cardinals, who when
they came to <hi>Rome</hi> were obliged
firſt to viſit the Pope, next St. <hi>Peter's</hi>
Church; afterwards the Dean and
Cardinals, and immediately after the
Queen, and if they made any other Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit
before, ſhe would not give them Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
She came to the Top of the
Stairs to receive Ambaſſadors, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
Princeſſes, Ambaſſadreſſes, and
concucted them back again to the ſame
place, and ſent her Gentlemen to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:54799:92"/>
them to their Coaches; but
ſhe came to the Bottom of the Stairs to
receive the Pope, and conducted him
back again alſo. For all the four Popes
which Reign'd in her time, came very
often to viſit her, and ſhe kept a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
for them alone; and ſeated them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a Cloath of State, embroidered
with Gold. She viſited alſo the Pope,
and never fail'd twice a Year, to wit,
at the Nativity of <hi>our Saviour,</hi> and
St. <hi>Peter's</hi> Day.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Poli</hi> had a Brother a
Cardinal, who is yet living, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Cardinal <hi>Conti;</hi> he was Biſhop of
<hi>Ancona,</hi> and made his ordinary Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
there; and as he was in a Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of being Pope, the Queen was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
glad to be in the Intereſts of that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
that ſhe might obtain ſome Credit
under his Pontificate, in caſe he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
to be choſe. This Incomparable
Queen, who pretended to ſurpaſs all
the World, one Day as the Cardinal
took leave of her to enter into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave,
after the Death of <hi>Innocent</hi> IX.
Embraced him and ſaid, <hi>Monſieur Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
Remember Queen</hi> Chriſtina, <hi>if you
become Pope, as I believe you will.</hi> The
Cardinal ſmil'd at this Diſcourſe, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:54799:92"/>
ſaid, <hi rend="margQuotes">He was her very humble Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
without any ſuch hopes; but in
what Eſtate ſoever God ſhould put
him, he would always remember the
Obligations that both himſelf and all
his Family had to her.</hi> This Diſcourſe
being reported to the Dutcheſs of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua
Sparta</hi> the Duke of <hi>Poli</hi>'s Daughter,
the ſaid, <hi rend="margQuotes">That if the Queen had no
better a Method to obtain Authority,
then in her Uncle's being choſe Pope,
ſhe was much deceiv'd; for mine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
(ſaid ſhe) will have enough to do,
to provide for ſo numerous a Family,
and ſuch a multitude of Kindred.</hi> As
to the reſt, tho' the Incomes of the
Duke of <hi>Poli</hi> were well paid, and that
he was in great Neceſſity, yet he quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Queens Service ſome time before
her Death upon a point of Honour.
The Queen took a fancy to declare the
Marquis <hi>Del Monte</hi> her Grand Maſter,
and in this Quality would oblige all the
Family to treat him with the Title of
Excellence. Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> who had
reaſons not to diſpleaſe her, obey'd
without Contradiction. But tho' the
Marquiſs was of moſt Nobl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Blood, as
his Sirname of <hi>Bourbon</hi> made it appear,
he never had this Title in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:54799:93"/>
Duke of <hi>Poli,</hi> having conſulted the
Duke <hi>de Bracciano,</hi> the Conſtable <hi>Colon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and other Princes of <hi>Rome,</hi> to know
whether they thought it convenient he
ſhould give this Title to the Marquis
<hi>Del Monte,</hi> they were all againſt it, and
concluded they would keep no further
Society with him, if he gave the Title
of Excellence to the Marquis. This
made the Duke reſolve to deſire his
Conge of the Queen, under pretext,
That his great Age of 75 Years oblig'd
him to retire, and prepare himſelf for
Death. And he had another reaſon as
ſpecious as the former; for the Queen
would have him give place to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>Del Monte</hi> out of the Palace, when
they went with her abroad; tho' ſhe
conſented, that the Duke ſhould have
the Preference within. This Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
being injurious to the Duke, he choſe
rather to forſake her Service and retire,
as we have ſaid.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Alibert</hi> Son to one of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
of the Houſe of Monſieur <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>

               </gap> born at <hi>Paris.</hi> After his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Death he was ſought after, for
ſome Miſcarriages committed in his
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:54799:93"/>
Charge; but be was ſo nimble, that he
ſav'd himſelf at <hi>Rome</hi> with above 50000
Livres in ready Money. At firſt he had
a magnificent Equipage, for he prepar'd
himſelf a Coach, four Lacquies, and a
<hi>Valet de Chambre;</hi> went with a fine Air,
and had the Ambition to play with great
Lords, and among others with the Princes
of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> at the Conſtable <hi>Colonna</hi>'s,
and other Ladies and Gentlemen, who
tho' they often pluck'd away ſome of his
Feathers, yet he had enough to ſuſtain
himſelf ſtill. In the Carneval-time he
had one of the proudeſt Chariots of all,
repreſenting Mount <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi>
and the Nine Muſes, which ſung in
Muſick; and this joyn'd with a Conſort
of Inſtruments, made a fine Symphony.
He paſs'd with this Magnificent Train
before the Queens Palace, and ſhe came
to know him by this means. She per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
him afterwards in her Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber,
and had ſome conſideration
for him, till at laſt ſhe took him into
her Service in Quality of Secretary of
Embaſſies. He was of a middle Stature,
and neither well nor ill made, except
that he was a little flat Nos'd; a great
Talker, and ſpoke nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
Sparkling enough, but of no So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54799:94"/>
Intriguing and Curious, but a
little fearful; full of Activity, and made
abundance of Motions, which tended to
no purpoſe. When he would compoſe
a Letter, he ſometimes did it well, but
it was after he had pillaged <hi>Balzac</hi> and
<hi>Voiture.</hi> He affected in his ſpeaking, to
declaim and geſticulate like a Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian;
and with all theſe fine Qualities he
entertain'd the Queen every Day after
Dinner for two or three hours. She
often corrected him, but he ſuffer'd it
very patiently; and above all, when he
brought her the News of the Pope's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
or the City, which were often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,
becauſe he knew not what to
ſay. I remember one Day the Queen
asking his Opinion of ſome black Laces
which ſhe had in her Hand, demanded,
Whether they were not Violet color? <hi>Yes,
Madam,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>they are Violet. You
are a Sot</hi> (ſaith the Queen) <hi>they are a
Dark Gray. 'Tis true, Madam,</hi> (ſays
the Count:) <hi>You're a Beaſt</hi> (ſays the
Queen) <hi>they are an obſcure Blue. That
is the Term</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that I could not find
out.</hi> In fine, he ſaid what ſhe would;
but after her Back was turn'd, addreſs'd
himſelf to the <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> and ſaid,
<hi>What Folly is this? But I muſt ſay as ſhe</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:54799:94"/>
               <hi>does.</hi> Another time, having a mind to
flatter the Queen upon the Whiteneſs of
her Hands, as ſhe was waſhing with her
Arms naked as high as her Elbow; <hi>I
must own, Madam, that your Skin is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
fine, and very white; 'tis admirable,
for 'tis all pure Nature, and Art has no
ſhare in it. Thou'rt a pleaſant</hi> Jack F—
(ſaid ſhe) <hi>to ſpeak to me after this manner?
Do'ſt thou think I am thy Wife that paints
as low as her Breech?</hi> He bore all theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
without Regret; and ſhe would
often ſay to him, <hi>Qui vive?</hi> And would
take Pleaſure in making him deny his
Country, and to ſay, <hi>Let</hi> France <hi>be
Damn'd,</hi> and even worſe than that, tho'
he was always a good <hi>Frenchman</hi> in his
Heart. One Day he demeaned himſelf,
laying by his Cloak, and took Nails and
an Hammer to tack and untack a Picture
againſt the Wall; where being mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a Chair which fell backward,
he had like to have broke his Neck. All
theſe Debaſements of himſelf, made the
other Gentlemen of the Queens Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

about the News of the War with Count
<hi>Caprara,</hi> whoſe Brother was in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:54799:95"/>
Service, and had been engag'd
in a Fight againſt the Viſcount <hi>Turenne;
Caprara</hi> would needs prefer his Brother
before this great Captain, which <hi>Alibert</hi>
could not ſuffer with Reaſon. But one
word drew in another, till they came to
groſs Injuries; and Count <hi>Caprara</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſpect of the Queens Palace, or her
Domeſticks, threatned to Battoon him;
and did it to the purpoſe. The
noiſe coming to the Queens Ears, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftead
of taking the Part of poor <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi>
to enrage him the more, applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Count <hi>Caprara,</hi> and told him that
he ought to be ſerv'd ſo. One Day as
Count <hi>Alibert</hi> reaſoned before the
Queen in the Preſence of the Meſſieurs
<hi>de Vendome,</hi> he ſaid ſo many ſilly things,
that theſe Princes as they were going
out, ſaid to their Governour; <hi>Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fible
that the Queen of</hi> Sueden, <hi>who hath
ſo much Wit, ſhould hear with Patience all
the Fopperies which</hi> Alibert <hi>utters every
Day, in ſo troubleſome a Manner?</hi> The
Queen knew very well they were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe, but did it only for her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement.
And it is impoſſible for a
Man that talks two hours a Day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Subject, but he muſt be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:54799:95"/>
After he had ſtaid ſome Years in the
Queens Service, he had a mind to Marry,
and made choice of the Niece of Col. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano,</hi>
who had commanded the Militia in
<hi>Corſica,</hi> before he was ſuppreſs'd for an
Inſult made upon the Family of the D.
of <hi>Crequi.</hi> The Baron <hi>Ornano</hi> Father
of the Lady, was very hot upon this
Match, believing that his Son in Law,
that was to be, was very rich, becauſe
he had been brought up with Monſieur
the Duke of <hi>Orleans;</hi> where one <hi>Ornano</hi>
had made his Fortune, and came to be
Mareſchal of <hi>France.</hi> But when the
Buſineſs was done, Count <hi>Alibert</hi> could
not have the Conſiderable Portion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
him. And as he had impos'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Wives Parents, by his Pride and
Boaſting, was himſelf ſham'd in his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary
Poſſeſſions, which he thought
lay in the Iſle of <hi>Corſica,</hi> which made the
Queen ſay, That both the Parties were
equally deceiv'd. And to add to the
Misfortune of Count <hi>Alibert,</hi> he loſt a
great deal at Play. But to make up his
Loſſes he had recourſe to Inventions;
for under the Pontificate of <hi>Clement</hi> X.
he ſet up a Lottery in the Hall of the
Colledge <hi>de Sapienza,</hi> where being aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
by ſome Friends, he put in ſome
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:54799:96"/>
odd Baubles, Looking<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Glaſſes, and other
little things. He oblig'd many Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to whom he ow'd Money, to take
Billets of his Lottery in Payment; but
almoſt all theſe Unhappy People loſt
their Debts, being paid only with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Paper; for when they came to
Draw, they met with nothing but
Blanks.</p>
            <p>After this he eſſay'd with ſome of
the <hi>Altieri</hi>'s to make a Theatre for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
at the <hi>Tour de None,</hi> which was
formerly the Priſon of <hi>Rome;</hi> and in
this he had the Addreſs to get a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Sum from the Queen to aſſiſt him
towards the Expence. The <hi>Altieri</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
too; and the Chevalier <hi>Acciajoli,</hi>
who is admirable at fine Decorations,
and to rectifie the Order of the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,
had the Conduct of the Enterpriſe.
It would have ſucceeded very well,
if Count <hi>Alibert</hi> could have abſtain'd
from Gaming: Not that he took any
great Pleaſure in Play, but engag'd in
it out of hopes of Winning; wherein
he was always deceived, for he had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good Fortune to befriend him, nor
ſufficient Underſtanding and Skill to
manage ſuch an Affair; ſo that it is no
wonder, if the Chevalier <hi>Acciajoli</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:54799:96"/>
call'd upon him to diſcharge the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences
of the Habits, as alſo the Salaries
of the Actors, and Muſicians. <hi>Acciajoli</hi>
complain'd to the Queen, and ſhe was
angry with him, but that could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
what was already loſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he muſt have Patience, and ſtay
till the Carneval was paſt, before he
could have the Money which he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

At laſt the Deſign was carried
on, and the Buſineſs compleated, but
he was never the Richer ſos it. He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

Marionnets at his own Houſe, and made
a Traffick of it. And for ſome time
he kept Playing in his Houſe, under the

not do it, becauſe it was forbidden in

he would Truck one thing, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
another. And after all, no <hi>Knight
of Induſtry,</hi> knew more Tricks than he;
And he that would undertake to write
the Particulars of his Life, might make
a large Volume of it. During the War in
<hi>Pomerania,</hi> the Queen not receiving her
former Rents, was forc'd to reform her
Houſe, and to throw off the greateſt
part of Domeſticks. The Count, with
many others, having loſt his Service,
was reſolv'd to try his Fortune in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Court, and went to <hi>Turin</hi> to offer
his Services to <hi>Madam Royal,</hi> who then
govern'd the Eſtate during the Minority
of the D. of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who now Reings. He
was well look'd upon in the beginning,
but when he was once throughly known,
they ſet but little by him: And ſo he,
who thought to have buſineſs only with
the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> found in that little Court
People ſo Spiritual and of ſo great Senſe,
that it does not give place to the Court
of <hi>France</hi> it ſelf, except in Number.
At laſt, Count <hi>Alibert</hi> being weary of
the Court of <hi>Savoy,</hi> or the Court of
<hi>Savoy</hi> of him, return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> where
he found his Counteſs, who did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:54799:97"/>
him with any great Impatience:
For this Lady had found an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of enjoying her ſelf with a Young
Man, who liv'd over her in the ſame
Houſe. As for the Young Man, he was
a <hi>Roman</hi> Gentleman, a Beau and Gallant,
who ſeeing the Conveniency the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
afforded, had no mind to run
further abroad, if you will believe the
<hi>Scandalous Chronicle.</hi> And as for the
Counteſs, ſhe was none of thoſe Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that would engage a Man in ſpight
of his Teeth; but the facility of ſeeing
her every day, or at leaſt at the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
engag'd them in a Commerce of
Gallantry, as much as the <hi>Italian</hi> Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
would permit. She was of a groſs
Stature, a fault very common among the
<hi>Romans.</hi> The turn of her Viſage Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
black Eyes, but well defended: And
as for her Complexion, ſhe was never
ſatisfied, borrowing from Art what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
had refus'd. She always daub'd
over her Face, as the Queen reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
told her Husband, which made it
ſhine like a Looking-glaſs, or a Bottle
of Oil, and caus'd her to looſe all her
Teeth at Forty years old. Her Mind
was as ill compos'd as her Body; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:54799:98"/>
but without Ground, that ſhe did not
want Adorers.</p>
            <p>After the Peace of <hi>Nimmeghen,</hi> the
Queen enjoy'd her Revenues again, put
her Court into its former Splendor,
and re-eſtabliſh'd Count <hi>Alibert</hi> in his
Charge. This did eaſily comfort him,
for his paſt Diſgraces, and to ſweeten
his Diſcontents, he would make Love to
Madam <hi>Beauregard,</hi> Daughter of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
of <hi>France,</hi> that made his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
with <hi>Mazarine.</hi> But fled into <hi>Italy</hi>
after Monſieur <hi>Fouquets</hi> Diſgrace, for
he was Tax'd by the Chamber of Juſtice;
but had the good luck to carry off the
beſt part of his Effects. He was Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
from <hi>Lucca,</hi> and was called <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dati;</hi>
ſo being a Refugee at <hi>Rome,</hi> he
put himſelf under the Protection of the
Conſtable <hi>Colonna,</hi> but did not live long.
His Widow was introduc'd by little and
little to the Queen; and ſhe had an on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Daughter, which was called Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſel
<hi>Diodati.</hi> This young Creature
was very Tall, and had the Air and
Viſage of a <hi>Musketeer:</hi> The lineaments of
her Face were irregular, and ſhe had
the fineſt Noſe in the World to carry a

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Spectacles. But in all the reſt, ſhe
he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> well and hondſome enough. As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54799:98"/>
her Wit, ſhe thought ſhe had enough,
becauſe ſhe had got all <hi>Clelia</hi> by Heart;
<hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Cleopatra</hi> were her Delight,
and by the help of Romances, ſhe was
become a precious Jewel of the firſt
Order. A ſturdy young Fellow, who
was the only Son of a Councellor of
the Parliament of <hi>Grenoble,</hi> called Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Beauregard,</hi> was come to <hi>Rome</hi>
unknown to his Father, and became
Amorous of ſo Charming a Perſon. He
liv'd with Madam the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> and
though he was well Shap'd, his Name
did not at all fuit him, for he was a
Slouch, Pur-blind, and of mean Regard.
This fine couple of Lovers ſerv'd to
divert all that came to the Houſe of
<hi>Colonna.</hi> Nevertheleſs, Love did ſo well
play his own Game, that they muſt
needs be Married, without the conſent
of the young Man's Father. The Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
of this Marriage was perform'd
in the Queen's Chappel, and in her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Preſence, by a little Prelate of
<hi>Lucca,</hi> call'd Monſieur <hi>Bottino,</hi> a Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to the Married Couple. He made
a very Spiritual Railery, and much to
the purpoſe, upon the Conſent of the
Parties, requir'd in the word <hi>Oui.</hi> Yes.
Saying, <hi>Though it was but a word compos'd
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:54799:99"/>
only of three Letters, it made many People
Repent.</hi> This was but too true in regard
of the Eſpouſed: For the young Man
not being able to get any ſuccour or
help from his Father, was forc'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into <hi>France</hi> to Plead againſt him.
He made two or three Journeys to no
purpoſe, and died in Miſery at <hi>Marſeilles,</hi>
leaving his Wife and three Children
behind him. Count <hi>Alibert</hi> endeavour'd
to Conſole her; but Compaſſion quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gave place to Love, and to break it
to her, he ſtudied the fineſt Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place
Books of the <hi>Romans,</hi> to make a
Speech according to his Fancy. But none
of them pleaſing him, he wrote one of
the moſt Elegant Letters that was to be
found in the Secretary <hi>a-la-mode,</hi> which
he got by Heart. Upon this, the Count
aſſum'd a fine Air, comb'd his Periwig,
and tied his Stockings about his Legs
better than ordinary, and his Cloak
did not hang on the left ſide, as in time
paſt; And for a Livery, he made a red
Serge Breeches, with white Sattin Points,
ſet out with a fine Galloon. Madam <hi>de
Beauregard</hi> who never had ſo Magnificent
a Lover before, anſwer'd the Count's
Deſires with all the Ardor he could
wiſh. All that diſcontented the Count
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:54799:99"/>
was, that ſhe came too faſt upon him,
for he would have conducted his Amours
like a <hi>Roman,</hi> that is to ſay, with one
Adventure upon another. But Madam
<hi>de Beauregard</hi> had a good Appetitite,
and did not care for Procraſtination.
Count <hi>Alibert</hi> was apparently at a Stand,
ſeeing he muſt for Decency ſake furniſh
his Counteſs with things neceſſary, who
then liv'd Soberly, that ſhe might give
no ill Impreſſions concerning her Perſon,
ſuch power had the Queen's Satyr's in
rendering her Vertuous. Madam <hi>de
Beauregard,</hi> who had her Ends, which
ſhe would not ſpeak of, was ſtark mad
that he was ſo cold. But he found a
way to content her; For he knew ſo
well how to take the Queen in a good
Humour; that he procur'd her a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Ten Crowns a Month, which
the Queen gave her for Life: And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Queen's Death, ſhe retir'd to
<hi>Lucca</hi> to her own Relations. As for
Count <hi>Alibert,</hi> the Queen left him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
though he deſerv'd it better than
moſt of them that had. Monſieur the
Duke of <hi>Chaunes,</hi> gave him the Office
of Secretary of the Chamber of Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
to <hi>France,</hi> but he perform'd no Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it, after Cardinal <hi>Janſon</hi> came
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:54799:100"/>
to have the charge of the Affairs of
<hi>France</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> his Eminence uſing his
own Prieſts and Domeſticks. Nor did
he long enjoy the Pay, becauſe the War
hinder'd it; For many more neceſſary
to the State than himſelf, found a great
deal of trouble in getting their Salaries.
However, he went up and down to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
News, as he us'd to do, without
bringing any thing to the purpoſe. His
great buſineſs was at the Theatre <hi>of Torre
de Nona,</hi> where he beſtow'd his Cares,
and ſubſiſted moſt of all by the Profit
which he drew from thence.</p>
            <p>If the Queen made Count <hi>Alibert</hi> her
Sport, who had Birth, and ſome Merit,
ſhe made a Miniſter, of her Favourite,
<hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> called <hi>Claret,</hi> who had
neither Birth nor Education. We will
relate ſome Circumſtances of his Life,
to ſee if he deſerv'd ſo great a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from ſo clear ſighted a Queen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clairet Poiſſonnet,</hi> Son to a Man that
kept a Cabbaret at <hi>Triere,</hi> a Village be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Pontoiſe</hi> and <hi>Poiſſi,</hi> was firſt Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quay
to Monſieur the Marquiſs <hi>de Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay,</hi>
who brought him to <hi>Rome,</hi> when
he was Ambaſſador from <hi>France.</hi> The
young Boy could neither Write nor
Read, but addicted himſelf to Comfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:54799:100"/>
and perhaps did not ill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
a Kitchen. Having loſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Lord brought him into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
where he got into the Service of
King <hi>Caſimir,</hi> before he was Crown'd.
But he did not ſtay there long, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a mind to ſee the Countries, he
engag'd himſelf in Service to the <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi>
Ambaſſador, who was then at <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw.</hi>
He came then with his Maſter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Sueden,</hi> and being very Active and
Handy, had the Honour to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Service of <hi>Chriſtiana</hi> Queen of <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
by means of one <hi>Bourdelot,</hi> a <hi>French</hi>
Phyſician, whom the Queen had drawn,
by ſeveral Gifts and Advantages to <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi>
to be near her Perſon. The firſt
Employ he had in the Queen's Houſe,
was to be Comfiter and keep the Linnen.
But in a little time he had the good
Fortune to make himſel known upon
this occaſion. Her Majeſty had ſent for
one <hi>Champagne</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Head-dreſſer,
out of <hi>France,</hi> who knew the Art in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
and therefore was much ſought
after by the fair Sex; and he came to be
known to her upon this occaſion. One
day as they were making a <hi>Wirchaff,</hi>
which is a ſort of Maſquerade in <hi>Sueden,</hi>
where every one, without being entirely
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:54799:101"/>
Mask'd, takes what Figure he pleaſeth.
<hi>Champagne</hi> who ſaw <hi>Clairet</hi> had very fine
Hair, had a mind to put him into Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's
Cloaths, and dreſs up his Head
<hi>a-la mode.</hi> The Caprice had good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;
For <hi>Clairet</hi> being then very Young,
and had a very freſh and lively Colour,
paſs'd for a Woman. The Queen, who
knew it, took great pleaſure in ſeeing
him in this Habit; and he Serv'd her
afterwards in many Affairs under this
Figure. There was a Court-Lord her
Majeſty was diſſatisfied with, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd
into one of the moſt diſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of the Realm, to hide and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
himſelf, and by that means to avoid
the effects of her Wrath. She had
much ado to diſcover him, becauſe there
was a great many Nobles in his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
and favour'd his retreat. <hi>Clairet</hi>
knew him at <hi>Stockholm,</hi> and promis'd the
Queen to bring News of him. And for
this purpoſe, Habited himſelf in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Apparrel, kept his Hair always
cloſe Shav'd, and went into the Province
whither the Gentleman was retir'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of being a Chambermaid to
Lady of that Country, who kept Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
with, and was the Queen's Friend
to aſſiſt <hi>Clairet</hi> to diſcover him. The
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:54799:101"/>
poor Gentleman had a <hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi>
who was a <hi>Piemontois</hi> and ſpoke <hi>French:
Clairet</hi> under this habit, got Acquaintance
with him, and ſeeing Love mix'd it ſelf
in the Converſation, it was eaſie enough
for <hi>Clairet,</hi> by means of her Lover, to
diſcover where the Gentleman hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
Who although he kept upon his
Guard, and apprehended Ambuſcades
and Traps to be laid for him, could not
hinder a Diſcovery through ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe.
<hi>Clairet</hi> being ſure of his Blow,
took Poſt and went to <hi>Stockholm</hi> to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe
the Queen, while the pretended
Damoſel paſs'd for a Sick Woman upon
the <hi>Piemontois,</hi> who Pray'd heartily, and
made Vows for her Recovery, with a
great deal of Zeal. In the mean time,
his Maſter was Seiz'd, and drank ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
deep of the Cup of the Queen's
Reſentments. <hi>Clairet</hi> having ſucceeded
ſo well, was made <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> to
her Majeſty: But it is ſurprizing, that
this Man, who knew neither how to
Write nor Read, and who never ſpoke
any Language tolerably, (for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
them all together) ſhould have
the Fortune to ſucceed ſo well in thoſe
things the Queen employ'd him. This
Princeſs ſeeing the Nobles Diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:54799:102"/>
at her Government, was deſirous to
eſtabliſh her ſelf with <hi>France.</hi> And to
keep her Affairs ſecret, could find no
better an Expedient, than to make uſe
of <hi>Clairet.</hi> After he had receiv'd his
Inſtructions, and a Letter of Credence
put between the Soals of his Boots,
he took his Leave of the Queen, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
pretence that the Climate was too
cold for him; and the favour was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with difficulty to all appearance.</p>
            <p>Upon his Arrival at <hi>Paris,</hi> he gave his
Letter to the Secretary of State for Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Affairs, and having given in his
Inſtructions by word of Mouth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
his Anſwer, he return'd into
<hi>Suedon,</hi> pretending he had repented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and was ſorry he had left the
Queen's Service. She took him again
with great difficulty, upon the preſſing
and earneſt Sollicitations of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
of <hi>Gardia</hi> and the Phyſician <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delot,</hi>
ſo well was the Play acted. One
Night as he went to drink with a Friend
of his, he was ſet upon by four Armed
Men, he drew a Piſtol, and had the good
luck to Wound one, but having made
head for ſome time, he was forc'd to give
way to Number, ſeeing he was already
Wounded himſelf; and they had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:54799:102"/>
done his Buſineſs, if one of the
Counts of <hi>Coningſmark,</hi> had not paſs'd
by accidentally, with four ſtout Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
carrying of Flambeaux, and given
him a timely, and ſeaſonable Aſſiſtance.
This Rencounter coming to the Queen's
Ears. She gave Orders to the Officers
of her Regiment of Guards, to ſend
two of the beſt and ſtouteſt Soldiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with <hi>Clairet,</hi> when he had a mind
to go abroad in the Night. It was never
known from whence this Blow came,
but it was ſuppos'd to be from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
of the Gentleman that was Arre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
by <hi>Clairet</hi>'s means. One of the
chief Senators of <hi>Sueden</hi> having found
that <hi>Clairet</hi> lov'd Drink, would have
forc'd him by Wine and Careſſes, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover
the Queen's Secrets but to no
purpoſe, for he could never Surpriſe him.
And it is Aſtoniſhing, that he ſhould be
more reſerv'd when he was Drunk, than
otherwiſe, for when he was in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he would do nothing but Sing,
Laugh, and play Monkey tricks. At
firſt he was Secret for his own Intereſt,
but became more reſerv'd afterwards,
and at laſt got ſuch an habit of it, that
all the World admir'd it. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
he was extreamly Curious, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:54799:103"/>
preſs'd very much to know the Secrets
of others. The Queen, who made uſe
of him for a Spy, was very glad to find
in him theſe good Qualities, and never
ſuffer'd him to be without good ſtore
of Money. With theſe helps he
would diſcover any thing he had a mind
to, inſomuch that the Count <hi>de Chanut,</hi>
Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Sueden,</hi> forbad
his Domeſticks to keep Company or have
any Converſe with him, becauſe when
he had made them Drunk, he would
lead them by the Noſe, and get from
them the moſt Secret Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of their Maſter. He had a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Memory, and never loſt one word
that he heard.</p>
            <p>After the Queen had Abdicated the
Kingdom, he accompanied her in all
her Voyages, and was Mareſchal of her
Lodgings; and when the Queen Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd
into <hi>France,</hi> he went before, and
had Order with the Abbot <hi>Bourdelot,</hi> to
make an hundred Embroider'd Caſſacks,
and as many Boots, Holſters, and Arms,
for an hundred Horſe Guards, that were
to accompany her at her entry into <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the King was with his Army in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and the Court at <hi>La Fere</hi> in
<hi>Tartenois,</hi> There came an Order for an
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:54799:103"/>
hundred thouſand <hi>Franks,</hi> to help her
to ſupport the charge of her Voyage.
<hi>Clairet</hi> had a Commiſſion to receive this
Money, and he carried it to Monſieur
<hi>Baſiniere,</hi> who told him, he had alſo
three thouſand <hi>Franks</hi> for himſelf, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
him to write a Receit for both the
Sums at the bottom of the Ordonnance.
He anſwer'd, that being a Gentleman,
he would give no Receipt, but would
commit it to one of his Lacquays.
But he was told that thoſe that
receive Money at the Royal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,
even as high as a General him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
wrote a Receipt with their own
Hands, below their Ordonnance, and
that it would not all derogate from his
Nobility. He found himſelf then in a
great Diſtreſs; For as on the one ſide
he was not willing to renounce ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
a Commiſſion, and on the
other, aſham'd to look like an Aſs. He
ſaid, to excuſe himſelf, that he had been
in a ſmall Skirmiſh, and was Wounded
in the right Hand, ſo that he could not
uſe it at preſent. So they made up a
Receipt for him, that he might ſubſcribe
his Name at the bottom; but they were
very much ſurpriz'd when they ſaw him
make nothing but a Croſs, and that he
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:54799:104"/>
knew not how to hold his Pen. This
made them Laugh, and it was ſent
to be Sign'd by the Queen's Intendant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clairet</hi> went afterwards to <hi>Triere</hi> his
place of Birth, to ſee his Parents,
and he treated them Magnificently, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the chief Inhabitants of the
Village, for he ordered Tables to be
prepar'd for above an hundred Perſons.
The Meat was the moſt delicate that
could be got; and as <hi>Triere</hi> is a place
that abounds in delicious Wine, they
drank to Exceſs. It was pretty to ſee
and hear the good People drink the King
and Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi>'s Health; the Feaſt
was ſo Splendid, that it made a kind of
Wake in the Village, and the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zett</hi>
made mention of it. What a loſs
it is, that the Mercury Gallant was not
then Invented, that Poſterity might
learn the Circumſtances of it! This
Feaſt encreas'd his Reputation; and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Mazarine</hi> one day demanding News
from the Queen, ſhe gave <hi>Clairet</hi> a very
advantageous Character, exaggerating
his Fidelity and Zeal for her Service.
His Eminency was aſtoniſh'd to hear
that a Man without Birth, Education, or
Study, ſhould be fit for every thing the
Queen would have him. The Queen
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:54799:104"/>
knew well enough, that ſhe was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in putting Confidence in him, and
therefore when ſhe deſign'd to Murther
the Marquiſs <hi>Monaldeſchi</hi> at <hi>Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau;</hi>
'twas <hi>Clairet</hi> that was the firſt
Conductor of the whole Intrigue, and
none truly knew but himſelf who they
were that Aſſaſſinated the poor Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Clairet</hi> was uſeful to the Queen in
her Voyage to <hi>France,</hi> he was not leſs
in that which ſhe made firſt to <hi>Rome,</hi> and
particularly in riding Poſt with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to Cardinal <hi>Antonio Barberini,</hi> to
know beforehand how ſhe ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
and treated both at her firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and during her abode there. He
never left the Queen in her Voyages,
whether into <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Germany.</hi> And while
this Princeſs was at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> upon the
Election of <hi>Clement</hi> IX. ſhe ſent <hi>Clairet</hi>
Poſt to <hi>Rome</hi> to Congratulate his Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and to beg permiſſion of him to
return to <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope receiv'd him
very well, and by him as the Queen's
Envoy, invited her to return, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to give her Eminent Marks of his
Paternal Friendſhip. And becauſe he
kuew <hi>Clairet</hi> when he was but a Prelate,
he Careſs'd him greatly, and gave him
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54799:105"/>
a Medal of Gold, of the value of Ten
Piſtols. <hi>Clairet</hi> begg'd of him the grant
of ſome Indulgences to the Chappel of
his Village; and he gave him an entire
Saint's Body over and above; and the
Prelate which diſtributed the Pope's
Graces, preſented him with a Prayer
that would keep him from all Evils,
provided he recited it every Morning.
He demanded, whether it would not
have the ſame effect, if it was ſaid by
another, and he was anſwer'd, that it
was better to recite it himſelf: Give
me then a Schoolmaſter, ſaid he, which
ſhall teach me to Read. This quick
Anſwer, made the Pope Laugh, and he
diſcharg'd him from the reading on't,
which would have the ſame effect, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in his Pocket. But <hi>Clairet</hi> was no
great ſayer of his Prayers, a Bottle of
good Wine went a great deal nearer his
Heart. His buſineſs every Morning
was to go into the place <hi>d'Eſpain,</hi> or
into the beſt Inns of the City, and when
any Stranger of Note arriv'd, he made
himſelf acquainted with his Followers
or Domeſticks, and from them learn'd
the Adventures of their Maſter, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their Voyage, and gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of all to the Queen. He ranſack'd
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:54799:105"/>
every where among the Ambaſſadors and
Miniſters of Princes, and made his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of all that he heard. And he
went alſo to the Poſt, and took from
thence the Letters which belong'd to
Gentlemen of Quality of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and after the Queen had read
them, Seal'd them up again, and carried
them back to the Poſt. But as theſe
things made him ſerviceable to the
Queen's pleaſure, it drew upon him a
great number of Enemies, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he was in danger of being knock'd
in the Head with Stones, or elſe ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Battoon'd. Though he knew neither
how to Write nor Read, yet he receiv'd
Letters every Poſt, and made an Anſwer
regularly thereunto, without ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
his own Secrets. In fine, after
he had liv'd till the 77th year of his
Age, he died almoſt ſuddenly at <hi>Rome,</hi>
upon the ſame day that Monſieur the
Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi> Deceas'd, and had the
Impudence to make the Queen his Heir,
though he did not leave one Farthing;
nay ſo far from it, that her Majeſty was
forc'd to Bury him; and afterwards had
the goodneſs to pay 500 Crowns that he
was Indebted to ſeveral People.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:54799:106"/>
Some time after, the Queen loſt her
brave Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte,</hi> at a time
when ſhe had moſt need of him to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Franchiſes of her Quarter,
which the Pope now began to Diſpute.
He died as he had lived, that is to ſay,
in Diſorder, having no time to Repent
in. The Circumſtances are terrible to
relate, but is however neceſſary, were it
only for Example ſake. How happy
are they who know how to profit by
the Faults of others! But for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
of the Story, we muſt take it
a little higher.</p>
            <p>After the Peace of <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> the Queen
who had been ſome Years without her
Rents, by reaſon of the War, ſent the
Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte</hi> into <hi>Sueden,</hi> where
he ſtaid above a Year, to put her Affairs
into order, and give an account of her
Majeſty's Receivers, who pretended
they were not able to pay her. The
King of <hi>Sueden</hi> was ſo favourable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o the

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
to uſe ſuch diligence in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tting
things into good Order, that the Queen's
Affairs went according to the Marquiſs's
Mind.</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>Sueden</hi> began to reſpire
after ſo many Loſſes, and the Marquiſs
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:54799:106"/>
paſs'd under the Figure of the Queen's
Envoy. Where when he had a little
ſettled Matters, he began to call thoſe
to an Account who had fingered the
Queen's Revenues, and he found many
who had been fiſhing in troubled Waters.
The Marquiſs wrote to the Queen, and
inſinuated his Thoughts, and deſir'd her
Majeſty te have ſome Compaſſion upon
the People, repreſenting that the Wars
had put them out of a condition to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the Obligations of their Leaſes.
The Queen either out of Generoſity or
Compaſſion, that ſhe might not beregret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by her ancient Subjects, diſcharged
them of many things; but the Marquiſs
never diſcover'd this Nobleneſs of the
Queen, till he had accomodated Matters
according to his own Intereſts; for he
always minded himſelf firſt, and the
Queen afterwards. He got new Tenants
to ſome parts of her Eſtates, and it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
him in ſuch ſort, that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Tenants made him Preſents, which
he greedily took with both hands, and
preferr'd them that gave moſt. After
he had continued a long while at <hi>Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm,</hi>
he went into <hi>Pomerania,</hi> which
was the Province from whence moſt of
the Queen's Rents came, where coming
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:54799:107"/>
into a City of that Country, he Lodged
at one of the Queen's Receiver's, who
had great Effects in his Hands, and he
treated him with all the Kindneſs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
to lay an obligation upon him
to confirm him in his Place. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
to ſerve him effectually, but it
was after he had drawn a good Preſent
from him; and he ſtaid a great while
in that Houſe, expecting as he ſaid, the
Queen's Anſwer. But the true reaſon
was, the Receiver had Marry'd a very
pretty Wife a little before that, and the
Marquiſs devour'd her Eyes, and delay'd
the time, in hopes to make himſelf Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lov'd.
The Receiver's Buſineſs oblig'd
him to be frequently abſent from his
Houſe, which gave <hi>Barbon</hi> an occaſion
to let her know how much he was in
Love. He was Bold, and ſhe Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
ſo that he would eaſily have
brought his purpoſes about, if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver's
Brother, who did not like the
Marquiſs's Proceedings, had not got an
inkling of the Matter. The Marquiſs
ſeeing this Rub in his way, feign'd that
he had receiv'd Letters from the Queen,
and that ſhe had ſent him a Blank, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
him therefore to get on Horſeback
quickly, and go two days Journey from
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:54799:107"/>
thence, to find out his Brother, who
muſt come to him, that they might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
their Affairs. This Man being
doubtful of the Marquiſs's Deſign, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
an Obedience. He got on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
but return'd the ſame Night,
and having left his Horſe with a Friend,
put himſelf into an Ambuſcade in a Place
where he knew the Marquiſs would paſs
to his Fair Siſter. Not long after, the
Marquiſs came, and without any other
Weapon but a Sword. He was all in
the dark, and walk'd very ſoftly, for
fear of Diſcovery. In the mean while,
the young Man, who could not diſcern
Objects, let fly a Piſtol in the dark,
charg'd with three Bullets, but miſs'd
the Marquiſs on purpoſe, who fell, and
roll'd down the length of a pair of Stairs,
which bruis'd his whole Body, and made
a dangerous Contuſion in his Head.
The Houſe was preſentld in an Uproar,
and the Domeſticks run together from
every ſide, and found the Marquiſs all
in his Blood. None of them knew what
to think of ſuch an Accident, but after
he had recover'd his Spirit, and the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
laid the firſt dreſſing to his Wound,
though yet full of Confuſion and Fear,
he ſaid, That he was coming in at the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:54799:108"/>
noiſe of the Piſtol, but taking a falſe
ſtep, had fall'n all along. In the mean time
the young Man got away without being
perceiv'd, and went to find his Brother
as faſt as he could, telling him that the
Marquiſs was too dangerous a Gheſt in
his Houſe, but told him nothing at all
of what had happen'd. At their return,
which was next day at Night, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver
was amaz'd to underſtand what
had happen'd, but the Marquiſs diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
it Wiſely, and after they had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
their Affairs, he return'd, for
<hi>Stockholm,</hi> to take leave of the King of
<hi>Sueden</hi> in order to return for <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being arriv'd at <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> he found
there <hi>Teixere</hi> the famous Jew, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
him to regulate the firſt payment
of the Queen's Revenues, which was
Ten thouſand <hi>Rix Dollars,</hi> and Five
thouſand more which the Farmer-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
had ſent upon the Queen's Account.
At laſt the Marquiſs arriv'd at <hi>Rome</hi> full
of Glory and Riches; for he made his
Journey worth thirty or forty thouſand
Crowns, where he was receiv'd both by
the Queen and Cardinal with great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
and the Queen's Houſe was put
into a good poſture, not forgetting that
of the Marquiſs. And the Queen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:54799:108"/>
every where that the Marquiſs
had done her good Service, ſome time
after rais'd him to the Charge of Grand
Maſter of her Horſe, which had been
vacant ſince the Murder of the Marquiſs
<hi>Monaldeſchi,</hi> ordering all her Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
to give him the Title of <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;</hi>
which though the Duke of <hi>Poli</hi>
refus'd, the reſt Obey'd.</p>
            <p>The Marquiſs after his return to <hi>Rome,</hi>
follow'd the ſame courſe of Life; but
not to trouble the Reader with his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauches,
I ſhall ſay only one word of his
diſreſpect both for the Palace and the
Queen's Domeſticks; for he ſpar'd nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them when they came in his
way. 'Tis true, he found a free Paſſage
in the Inſtance I ſpeak of; but he ought
to have ſtopp'd the Scandal, rather than
encreaſe it by his own Example. But to
come to the particulars.</p>
            <p>The Queen's Court being then becom finer
than ever, every one fell into ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Amour or other. <hi>Seignora Giovannia
Giuſtiniani,</hi> younger Siſter to <hi>Signora
Octavia,</hi> was a very lovely Maid, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
brown, but having all the Ligeaments
of her Viſage excellently formed: A fine
Stature, together with ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine a Neck, that
the like was no where to be ſound. At
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:54799:109"/>
firſt when the Queen brought her from
her own Village, ſhe was ſimple enough,
but the Court Air quickly refin'd her,
and ſhe was not very long in taking the
humour of being Talkative and Proud;
Manners, to which the moſt elevated
of that Sex find ſo ſtrong an Inclination.
Her Majeſty had a great kindneſs for
her, but ſhe abus'd her good will, and
became ſo preſumptuous, that ſhe would
not acknowledge her Birth. A Page of
the Duke <hi>d'Eſtre's</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi>
was the firſt that offer'd Incenſe at her
Altar. He was a young <hi>Italian</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
well Shap'd, Fair and Gallant, and
and had every thing requiſite to create
Affection. The Palace <hi>Farneſe</hi> where the
Ambaſſador lived, was over againſt the
Queen's at <hi>Langara.</hi> The <hi>Tyber</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, with a double range of
Houſes, but the two Palaces were ſo

               </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty, that our two Lovers could eaſily
ſee one another upon the Terraſſes, and
make Signs of Intelligence. At laſt they
found a way to ſend Billets, and the
Queen being no way prepoſſeſs'd, took
pleaſure in this Foolery. One day the
Queen Surprized <hi>Signora Giovannina,</hi> as
ſhe was writing a <hi>Billet-deux;</hi> and ſhe
was ſo attentive to anſwer her Lover,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:54799:109"/>
that ſhe did not perceive the Queen
when ſhe ſeiz'd upon her Letter. The
poor Girl believ'd ſhe was utterly Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd,
for ſometimes the Queen, at leaſt
to appearance, would make a ſhew as
if ſhe were Severe. <hi>Giovannina</hi> then
caſt her ſelf at her Feet, apprehending
that ſhe ſhould have been ill treated, but
ſhe was quickly rid of her fear, for the
Queen Smiled, and was ſo complaſant,
that having forbidden her to ſpeak of
it, ſhe made a Billet for her after her
own faſhion, which was the moſt ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
in the World. Tre Page raviſh'd
with joy to receive the marks of ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliging
a Tenderneſs, from his Miſtreſs,
was ſo little Maſter of himſelf, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
through Vanity, or Indiſcretion,
he ſhew'd the Billet to a Gentleman of
of the Houſe, who made it known to
the Ambaſſador; but he only Laugh'd,
and would ſee what courſe and Method
theſe Lovers would take. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Spring, another of the
Queen's Maids, named <hi>Portia,</hi> under the
pretence of being Indiſpos'd, got leave
of the Queen to take the Air of the
Fields every morning with her Kinſwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Giovannina,</hi> in their Mother's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
They went out of the Gate of
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:54799:110"/>
St. <hi>Pancras,</hi> and going along the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts,
re-enter'd by the Gate of the
<hi>Light-Horſe,</hi> on St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſide. By this
means, our Lovers ſaw one another of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
but they muſt do it with Secrecy
for fear of <hi>Argus</hi>'s, I mean the Old
Women, who would no more leave
them than their Shadows, according to
the Cuſtom of <hi>Italy.</hi> But Love found
them out a way to ſee one another more
eaſily. For the Page being bold and
hardy, got into the Queen's Garden,
which was of large Extent, where there
was great Walks, ſhaded with fine
Greens, and there theſe Virgins came
to take the freſh Air every Morning;
and they were both agree'd to ſerve one
another upon ſuch Occaſions. There
the Page and his Miſtreſs were hid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and without as Witneſs, declar'd
their Loves, and ſpoke the tendereſt
things in the World. The Pleaſure
continued for ſome time, to the great
ſatisfaction of both; but their Interview
being diſcover'd, ſhe was oblig'd to be
more retir'd. The Page, whom theſe
Obſtacles made the more ardent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
new ways to ſee his Miſtreſs; but
ſome ſmall difference happening between
the Queen and the Ambaſſador, he was
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:54799:110"/>
to keep at a diſtance for ſome time.</p>
            <p>The Marquiſs <hi>de Mala Spina</hi> was the
next, who was Gentleman of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to her Majeſty. He was Young, and
well Made, extraordinary Handſome,
and had a Bon Grace in all that he did:
But he was an univerſal Lover, and
manag'd an Amour like a <hi>Roman</hi> Hero.
It was only Languiſhing and Sighs, that
expreſs'd his Flame at the firſt, and he
was diligent both Night and day, to make
her ſee and underſtand it. She gave him
ſome Hopes which made it ſtronger,
which were fully to be explain'd by the
Marriage Bed. But however the Queen
had no inclination to give the poor
Gentleman any thing, though he had
ſerv'd her as a Page from his Youth;
and her Majeſty had beſtow'd Favours
upon others who had not merited ſo
much as himſelf. Her Caprice croſs'd
this Amour, but his Patience and Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity
gain'd his Miſtreſſes Heart, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that ſhe gave him to underſtand,
that if he was not Happy, it would be
his own fault. But however, theſe fair
hopes were of no long continuance, for
the Count of <hi>Warwick</hi> came in to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
'em, by declaring himſelf a Lover,
and was receiv'd with little Ceremony.
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:54799:111"/>
He was an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lord of high Birth,
Son to the Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> but
being a younger Bro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>er of that Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Houſe, which were Perſecuted for
their Loyalty to their King, during the
Troubles of <hi>England,</hi> rais'd by <hi>Cromwel</hi>
and the Parliament, he was oblig'd to
ſeek his Fortune in Foreign Courts; and
was at laſt recommended to the Queen,
who made him <hi>Major Domo,</hi> after the
Death of the Marquis <hi>Del Monte.</hi> The
Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> died at <hi>Florence,</hi>
where both himſelf and Family, were
Maintain'd by the Bounty of the Grand
Duke. Count <hi>Warwick</hi> was of a ſlender
Stature, and had an Air of Grandeur,
which ſhewed who he was. His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
was very delicate, but his Health
ſeem'd to be ruin'd, by the paleneſs of
his Face, whether it came from his
Temperament, or Debaucheries. As to
the reſt, his Carriage was the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
in the World; and if his
Health had been perfectly entire, he had
been one of the fineſt Gentlemen in
<hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marquiſs <hi>de Mala-Spina</hi> being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed
at ſo redoubtable a Rival, did
not know what to do, daring neither to
conceal nor publiſh it, becauſe of the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:54799:111"/>
Antipathy of the Queen againſt him:
But his good Genius inſpir'd him to go
to a Lady of Quality who was Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a <hi>Roman</hi> Lord, (Captain of a
Troop of Light-Horſe in the Pope's
Guards) called the Marquiſs <hi>Cavallieri,</hi>
his Lady being Siſter to Count <hi>Warwick.</hi>
He entreated her to do him the Favour,
to repreſent to her Brother, that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
in addreſſing himſelf to <hi>Jovan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nina,</hi>
being not to Marry her, he would
not croſs a Paſſion, which tended to that
Holy Sacrament. The Marchioneſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
undertook it, for fear her Brother
ſhould fall into any Trouble in the
Queens Service, and caus'd him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt;
ſo that the Marquiſs was quickly
at Repoſe on that ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jovannina</hi> having loſt Count <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi>
treated the Marquiſs much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for fear he ſhould eſcape again;
and theſe two Lovers manag'd their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
ſo well, that the Maid (by the
Aſcendant ſhe had over the Queen)
brought her to conſent that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
ſhould make Love to her in the
way of Marriage. But Cardinal <hi>Az<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zolini,</hi>
who was afraid the Queen would
execute this Project, and ſpend as much
Money upon her, as ſhe had done upon
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:54799:112"/>
               <hi>Octavia</hi> her Elder Siſter, turn'd the
Queen againſt it, and broke all the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of theſe poor Lovers, and at laſt
to comfort her ſaid, The Marquis was
impotent, and no way fit for Marriage.
The poor Girl afflicted with ſo many
Croſſes, fell ſick, and muſt take the
Air again to diſſipate her Sorrows. And
ſhe had ſcarce begun to take Breath,
when a certain <hi>Italian</hi> Abbot of ſome
Birth, but little Merit, and full of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
thought it a ſeaſonable time to
perſwade her to hear of a Paſſion which
he begun to have for her. To this
purpoſe he employ'd a Woman, who
was one of the Queens Guardrobe,
who had not been Cruel in her Youth,
and was very proper to tie an Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Nooſe. And as ſhe had an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Appartment of the
Maids, and ſome part of their Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
it was eaſie for her to perſwade
<hi>Jovannina</hi> to have ſome Complaiſance
for the Abbot <hi>Vannini,</hi> the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that had already diſhonoured <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diere</hi>'s
Daughter</p>
            <p>This Maid being dejected at the ill
ſucceſs of her Amours, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of being caſt off by ſo many Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
embrac'd the Motion, upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:54799:112"/>
that her Mother approv'd it.
The good Mother who liv'd upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Wages of the Daughter,
and had other Children beſides, and an
Husband to maintain, yielded to the
Temptation of a Thouſand Crowns
which he gave her, and deliver'd up
her Daughter to this Villainous Baboon,
whom Vanity, and the Difficulty of it,
ſtir'd up to ſo hard an Enterpriſe. To
come to him, ſhe counterfeited her ſelf
ſick once more, and the Queen out of
Complaiſance ſent her to <hi>Albani,</hi> where
not to lengthen out the Story, the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
was ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>After fifteen or twenty Days abſence,
ſhe return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Abbot
(who found her a delicate Morſel) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
a way to introduce himſelf into
the Queens Palace, by means of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
Confidents. His Liberalities
gave him Entrance every where, and
ſurmounted all Obſtacles, but he could
not do his Buſineſs ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>retly, but that
it was found out by the Marquiſs <hi>Del
Monte,</hi> for he ſurpriz'd the Lovers in
the very flagrant Delight, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to deſtroy them, if he did not come
in for a ſhare. And as he was Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with the Queen, ſo he had a Talent
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:54799:113"/>
to make himſelf fear'd: Thus he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
his Wiſhes, and the Abbot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
paid the Expence of the Feaſt.</p>
            <p>But after all theſe Pleaſures, poor
<hi>Jovannina</hi> found her ſelf with Child,
which affrighted her, and made her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
deſolate, ànd her Mother became
the moſt ſorrowful of all Women;
but the Queens Goodneſs ſupply'd all
Defects, and ſhe had Remedies given
her to take it away, but they had ſo ill
ſucceſs that ſhe died, and was interr'd
in the Habit of a Carmelite Crown'd,
and ſet round with Flowers, for a
mark of her Virginity. The Queen
wept as much as if ſhe had been a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſo good was this Princeſs, and
ſo full of Tenderneſs for her Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
that ſhe would have left them all
Rich at her Death if they would have
permitted her to do it. 'Tis Time that
wipes away Tears, and Her Majeſty
comforted her ſelf for the loſs of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vannima,</hi>

At this time the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come to <hi>Rome,</hi> the Queen did him
ſo great Honours, as none ever recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from her before, and the Duke on
his ſide would not be behind her in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility;
but at laſt the Ceremonies aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
both of one and the other ſide. The
Queen was over joy'd that a Sovereign
Prince came to viſit her, for no Body
would viſit her, ſince ſhe had caus'd the
Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte</hi> to be Treated with
the Title of Excellence; and ſhe was
well enough pleas'd, that the Duke of
<hi>Mantua</hi> ſpoke to him by a third Perſon,
as is uſual at <hi>Rome</hi> to avoid Diſputes,
without giving him any Title. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Marquiſs never quitted the
Duke all the time he ſtay'd at <hi>Rome,</hi>
who though he came <hi>in cognitio,</hi> had
the fineſt number of Followers that any
Prince ever had. For almoſt all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of his Eſtates accompanied him,
and the <hi>Roman</hi> Cavaliers throng'd in to
add to the Number of his Train, but
he had the Moderation to hinder his
<hi>Guards du Corps</hi> to accompany him on
Horſeback, giving order that ſome of
them only ſhould follow him on Foot. He
Lodged at the Palace <hi>Des <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſins</hi> in
<hi>Monte Giordiano,</hi> and the Queen ſent
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:54799:114"/>
him every Morning not only her beſt
Coach, but two more of the Houſe-Choaches,
and one part of her Pages, with
Men that bore Staves.</p>
            <p>The Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi> Ambaſſadour of
<hi>France</hi> did the ſame, to augment his
Train, and there came with him Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Gambaul</hi> the Envoy of <hi>France</hi> to
his Highneſs. I ſhall ſay nothing of the
Publick Honours done him at <hi>Rome,</hi> the
Gazettes have ſpoken enough of it, and
therefore I ſhall rather chuſe to make
mention of the Private Divertiſements,
in which the Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte</hi> was
his Procurer, becauſe they are known
to very few.</p>
            <p>He brought him acquainted with
<hi>Georgina,</hi> the Famous Singer, and he
was exceedingly Charm'd to hear her
Sing one Evening at the Vineyard of
<hi>Corſini,</hi> without the Gate of St. <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cras,</hi>
whether he brought her without
the Queens Knowledge. He ſaw her
often afterwards with the Queen her
ſelf, and agreed with her to carry her
off, and bring her into his own Eſtates,
but ſhe did not keep her Word. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time he Regal'd the Duke with
one <hi>Fani</hi> in the ſame place. She was
ſo fine a Widow that ſhe made her ſelf
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:54799:114"/>
the common Topick of Diſcourſe; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that her Parents ſhut her up in
a Convent, but ſhe found a way to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape,
and retire into the Queens
Quarter.</p>
            <p>This anger'd the Pope very much, ſo
that having now underſtood ſhe was
gone out of the Queens Franchiſe, to
meet the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> at the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard
<hi>Corſini,</hi> gave order for a Bariſeel
to ſeize and carry her off, as ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
from thence. But having time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
notice, ſhe was put into one of the
Queens Coaches, with her Siſter <hi>La
Moſca,</hi> and by this means re-entred the
Franchiſes in ſpite of the Pope's Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe two Siſters were Daughters to
a rich Banker, who had given them
Twenty Thouſand Crowns a-piece to
their Portions, and had Married them
to the moſt Eminent Nobles of <hi>Italy.
Fani</hi> was of a middle Stature; the turn
of her Viſage was very agreeable, Blue
Eyes, a fair Skin, and in good Health,
fine Teeth, a little Mouth, and very
pretty, had not Laughing ſpoil'd it: But
her Mind was Fooliſh, and ſhe had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Judgment, and leſs Conduct. Her
Siſter, who was call'd <hi>La Moſca,</hi> was
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:54799:115"/>
not quite ſo ſparkling, but all things
conſidered, was more eſteem'd then <hi>Fani.</hi>
Nevertheleſs ſhe was a well ſhap'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
of a ſolid Wit, and had the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
to appear Fair in the Eye of the
World, ſo that her Freaks were known
but to few. <hi>Fani</hi>'s firſt Amours were
with the Marquiſs <hi>Mari</hi>) who went
with her to Comedies all the Carneval,
and every Night to a Ball. She had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
a great many Lovers, of which
many Stories might be made, but this
would drive us too far from our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>The Young Marquiſs <hi>Mathew Del
Monte,</hi> Son to <hi>Barbon,</hi> became Amorous
of her, though he was Married; but
to ſpeak the Truth, ſhe was rather A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
of him; for the Young Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
had all Exteriour Qualities that
were fit to render him amiable. He was
of a Stature ſomething above the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
height, a well made Perſon, and
had the Air of a Man of Quality; but
Preſumptuous, deſpiſing his Equals,
and ſo conceited of his Birth, that his
Vanity made him inſupportable, which
yet notwithſtanding proceeded only
from his Youth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:54799:115"/>
After his Return from <hi>France,</hi> his
Father would Marry him to the Niece
of the Marquiſs <hi>Monaldeſchi,</hi> the ſame
whom the Queen had Sacrific'd to her
Reſentment in the Gallery of <hi>Fontain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau:</hi>
Her Majeſty being deſired to give
her Conſent, did it accordingly, and it
was a great Advantage to the Marquiſs,
for ſhe was an only Daughter, very Rich,
and yet more accompliſh'd by her Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
but the pooreſt Lady in <hi>Italy</hi> for
Beauty, though ſhe had a fine Stature
and an Air good enough, when ſhe was
Maſqued. The Young Marquiſs having
underſtood this laſt Quality, would not
Marry her, though he eſteem'd her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Perfections, being paſſionately in
Love with <hi>Gabrieli</hi> Niece to a Cardinal
of the ſame Name, who was very
handſome. But the Marquiſs his Father
being more tied to his own Intereſt than
his Son's Satisfaction, would be obey'd.
The Son reſiſted, but the Father outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
with Choler, and mad that his
Son contemned ſo great Advantages, and
the Opportunity of making his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
ſet a Poniard to his Throat to
compel him to reſolve upon't. The
Queen, when ſhe came to her Preſence,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:54799:116"/>
knew ſo well how to flatter her, that
ſhe gave her ſelf up to her Reaſons,
and ſo the Marriage was concluded by
Her Majeſty's means: By which we may
know that Hatred is not Immortal; for
ſhe was willing upon this occaſion, to
give ſatisfaction to the Memory of her
Uncle, by the Honours ſhe would do to
his Neice. The Nuptial Benediction
was performed in the Queens Chappel,
and in her Preſence, where ſhe often
told the Husband leaning upon his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<hi>Ah how well ſhap'd and Charming is
your Bride!</hi> But he turning aſide his
Head, becauſe he would not give a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect
to Her Majeſty, always an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
That he knew the contrary but
too well. The Young Marquiſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
himſelf for ſome time within the
Duties of Marriage, but at laſt flew off,
and embarked himſelf with <hi>Fani,</hi> who
became Fooliſh, and paſs'd eight times a
Week in a Coach by <hi>Langara,</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee
and be ſeen of the Young Marquiſs. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Body laugh'd in the Palace-Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
but as on the one hand Love
cannot be altogether reſtrain'd, ſo on
the other, ſhe ought to have manag'd
things better, both to avoid Scandal,
and for her own Intereſts. For the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:54799:116"/>
Prince of <hi>Belleville</hi> who Maintain'd her
at that time, could not endure this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and threatned to forſake her, if
ſhe did not break off this new Intrigue.
She would not looſe him, not ſo much
for his Merit, as Liberalities to her, and
therefore conſtrain'd her ſelf for ſome
time. The Marquiſs who was of an
hot Temper, and Tranſported of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
threatned to deſtroy all things, if
ſhe did not regard him better, as if the
Lady could Live upon his good Mein
and Vigour, for that was all he paid
her.</p>
            <p>One Day as ſhe paſs'd by his Houſe
tel in a Coach, being Tranſported with
Choler, he came immediately down
Stairs, cut the Harneſs of her Coach,
and gave her many Blows on the Face,
ſpeaking all the Vile and moſt Infamous
Things, that could be ſaid to Common
Whores. Poor <hi>La Moſea,</hi> who was
in the Coach with her, thought ſhe
ſhould have died for fear. <hi>Fani</hi> ſuffer'd
her ſelf to be thus abuſed, and did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but cry; but the Spectators were
like Stocks, immoveable at the Sight of
the Tragedy, for there was never any
Example before of ſo criminal an Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
So the Pope, who was a great
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:54799:117"/>
Enemy to theſe Scandals, caus'd them
both to be Arreſted, and would have
ſent the Marquiſs to the Caſtle of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo,</hi>
if he could have got him out of
the Queens Quarter: But at laſt Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Colonna</hi> did remonſtrate to the Pope,
that the two Siſters being Widows,
were not oblig'd to live with the ſame
Circumſpection as if their Husbands
were living.</p>
            <p>The good Prince <hi>Belleville,</hi> employ'd
all his Intereſt to obtain her Liberty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that after ſo publick an Affront,
ſhe would have broke entirely with him.
But he was very much miſtaken, for ſhe
was no ſooner out of Hold, but ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
fled into the Queens Quarter,
who receiv'd her very well, and was
mightily overjoy'd ſhe had got this Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
<hi>Fani,</hi> who was every where
talk'd of as one of the moſt perfect and
exact Beauties. She kept her continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
afterwards, till in the Young Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs's
Abſence, who was ſent into <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
the Father got her ſent away, and
would not permit her to return any
more.</p>
            <p>After the Departure of the Duke of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> and the Death of the Prince
<hi>Col<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>bier,</hi> the old Marquiſs who ought
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:54799:117"/>
to have retir'd by reaſon of his great
Age, begun to make Love more than
ever. The Marquiſs <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> who
drew his Nobility from the antient <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>
of this famous Name, as 'tis
thought, but whoſe Riches did not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
his Quality, had Married one of
the fineſt Women of <hi>Italy,</hi> who was of
mean Birth, but Rich, and though ſhe
had brought him many Children, had
not yet loſt that luſtre which ſparkled
in all her Perſon. Her Stature was of a
middle ſize, but ſlender, her Complexion
fine and united; her Eyes, Mouth and
Teeth in a rare Perfection; and beſides
had a Wit that was lively, pleaſant and
agreeable. The Marquiſs who had a
numerous Family upon his Hands, had
a mind to enter into the Queens Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
in Quality of a Gentleman of her
Chamber, which was eaſie for him to
obtain by the Credit of the Marquiſs
<hi>Del Monte,</hi> who procur'd it more for
his Wifes ſake than his own. The Tye
that was between the two Marquiſſes,
being now both in the Queens Service,
gave <hi>Barbon</hi> a free acceſs to the Fair <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga,</hi>
Wife to <hi>Cocles,</hi> for ſo was <hi>Cincin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi>
called, becauſe he had but a ſhort
ſight. The Queen that knew all that
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:54799:118"/>
paſs'd, (for <hi>Barbon,</hi> to divert her, told
her all his good Fortune) ſaid, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Cocles,</hi> That he had an happy ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of what was done at his Houſe;
for his ſhort ſight hinder'd him from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many things which otherwiſe would
terribly vex him. He ſeem'd to do what
he could not underſtand when himſelf
was ſpoken of; and yet he was perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
at the Queens, where he paſs'd his
time in telling of News with the other
Courtiers. The Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte</hi>
was ſo charmed with his Miſtreſs the
Fair <hi>Riga,</hi> that he reſolv'd from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward
to fix all his Love upon her; ſo
that he did all that he could to make
himſelf agreeable; he ſpent more than
ordinary, Regal'd his Miſtreſs often,
took care to inform himſelf in the New
Modes, that he might bring her News
of it, and was very liberal towards the
Ladies Domeſticks, and others who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
him in his Amour. And whereas
when he was threeſcore Years of Age,
he endeavour'd to ſupport his Vigour by
Art. But one Day being more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
heated, he ſlept upon his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes
Bed till Dinner time; and as it
happen'd, the Abbot <hi>Cincinnatus</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſſes
his Brother came in unawares,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:54799:118"/>
without being perceiv'd, and ſaluting
his Fair Siſter, was extreamly ſurpriz'd
to ſee <hi>Barbon</hi> ſleeping upon the Bed:
He demanded of the Fair <hi>Riga</hi> from
whence this Sottiſhneſs proceeded? She
preſently anſwer'd, That the Marquiſs
being come to ſee <hi>Cincinnatus,</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with a Faintneſs, which oblig'd him
to lie upon the Bed. <hi>That's all Trifle,</hi>
(reply'd the Abbot) <hi>'tis you have put him
out of Breath. Riga</hi> fell into Tears, and
anſwer'd, <hi>Alas Monſieur, I hope you will
not kill him? No, Madam,</hi> (anſwer'd
the Prelate) <hi>you will much oblige me to kill
him your ſelf.</hi> The Marquiſs awak'd
with the Noiſe, and being much ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to find himſelf in ſuch a place with
ſo good Company, ſaid in his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
That he came thither to ſeek for
<hi>Cincinnatus</hi> from the Queen, and being
taken with a Faintneſs and Stupidity of
Brain, he was conſtrain'd to lay himſelf
down upon the firſt Bed he found. This
Prelate who was very wiſe, and did not
think it convenient to make a noiſe of
it, left the Guilty to their Remorſe, and
pretended to change the Diſcourſe, but
could not hinder himſelf from ſaying,
<hi>Marquiſs have a care of your ſelf, and
manage it ſo with her, that you remember
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:54799:119"/>
you are no more Young; Reflect upon what
I have ſaid, and turn it as you pleaſe:</hi>
And ſo being a little more pleaſant he
retir'd; but <hi>Riga</hi> all in confuſion ſhut
her ſelf up in her Cloſet, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
went away in all haſte.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Pope was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
oppreſſed with the Complaints
daily made of the Diſorders committed
in the Franchiſes, and particularly in
the Queens Quarter. He lamented that
he was the only Sovereign that could
not be Maſter of his Capital City, and
could not hinder the greateſt Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
This at laſt confirm'd him in the
Reſolution, to execute the Deſign he
had long before conceived of aboliſhing
theſe Franchiſes of Quarters, and he did
it a while after with a Courage that was
not to be ſhaken. He was always of
this Mind, that it would put Tranquili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Calmneſs among Families, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and fair Dealing into Trade and
Commerce, and would make the City
ſecure. And it is ſo true that the fear
of Puniſhment is neceſſary to Mankind,
and Nature without Grace ſo corrupt,
that the hope of Impunity carries Men
on inſenſibly to commit the greateſt
Crimes. 'Tis certain, that if this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:54799:119"/>
had been well brought about, it
would have Immortaliz'd the Pope who
began the Enterpriſe. In truth he had
all the Zeal that was neceſſary upon
ſuch an occaſion; but being encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by People who were declar'd Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to a Crown he ought to have the
greateſt reſpect for, he was carried on
to thoſe Exceſſes that everlaſtingly ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied
the high Reputation which he had
acquir'd by his Innocence and Holy Life.
But before we enter into a Diſcuſſion of
his great Affair, where the Queen had
a conſiderable ſhare, we muſt make an
end of the Hiſtory of the Marquiſs <hi>Del
Monte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the time the Queen united her
Intereſts with thoſe of the Marquiſs
<hi>Lavardin</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſatisfaction of the Pope, for the
Violence of his Miniſters concerning the
Quarters. <hi>Barbon</hi> perſwaded the Queen
to make a Serenade to ſpight the Pope,
and ſo much the rather ſeeing the Seaſon
was proper for it: And accordingly
Couplets and Songs were made, and
recited with Conſorts of Inſtruments;
the moſt famous Muſicians in <hi>Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Party, with two of the fineſt
Singers the Queen had, <hi>Georgina</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:54799:120"/>
and <hi>Mariouche</hi> or <hi>Maronte</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Barbon</hi> and <hi>Landini.</hi> They made
alſo an Amphitheatre in a little Garden
of Jeſſamy, which was towards the
Street, at the Appartment of Marquiſs
<hi>Del Monte,</hi> over againſt the Queens Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
where there was great preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for there was a number of Galleries
built for the Ladies, and he fail'd not
to put the Fair <hi>Riga</hi> in full view, by
building a Place on purpoſe for her and
her Friends. There was alſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions
in the Queens great Hall, the
laſt of which was extraordinary, by Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations
and an hundred ſort of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
and fine Voices which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd
the Harmony, which was moſt
Charming. That which was moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
was to ſee Marquis <hi>Del
Monte</hi> beſtir himſelf to put all things in
order, and command every one to his
Duty. The Fair <hi>Riga,</hi> with other La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
whoſe Husbands had any Charge
under the Queen, ſate in little Boxes
on the upper part of the Hall, and
there was nothing to be heard, but the
yauling of the Feminine Voice of the
Marquiſs. He was all on fire through
the Vehemence of the Action, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all was done, thruſt himſelf forward
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:54799:120"/>
to re-conduct the Ladies, and do the
Honours of the Houſe; the laſt Careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which he made, were to <hi>Mariouche</hi>
his dear Daughter, applauding her that
ſhe had Sung ſo well this Night. The
Queen was pleas'd to the higheſt point,
that her Opera ſucceeded ſo well, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the Marquiſs before his Face,
and withdrew very late; and the <hi>Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Chronicle</hi> ſaith, That ſhe went to
abandon her ſelf with the Fair <hi>Riga.</hi>
Being retir'd at laſt to his own Houſe, he
drank a great deal of Soup, and Sup'd
well, and among other things eat a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lad
of Cellery well prepar'd.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he went to Bed, and roſe
next Morning about eleven of the Clock,
to ſhave himſelf, and at the ſame time
was taken with an heavineſs in his Head,
and palpitation of his Heart: Quickly
after he fell into a kind of Convulſion
Fit, which made him lean his Head on
the Back of his Chair; he fell a foaming
at the Mouth, his Face was ſwell'd and
diſcolour'd, and his Eyes ſtar'd. All
the Houſe was in an Allarm, and the
Crys and Tears came to the Queens
Ears, who ran thither preſently; but
ſeeing him ſtiff and in this Condition,
was ſtruck with ſuch an Horrour that
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:54799:121"/>
ſhe return'd all in Confuſion, and had
not the Courage to ſpeak one word of
Comfort to any. To make ſhort, he
never came out of his Fit, but died ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
without Senſe, and his Enemies
ſpread it abroad, that the Devil ſtrangl'd
him; and others ſaid, that having ſet at
naught, both the Pope's Remonſtrances
and Threatnings, God had viſibly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
him. But 'tis moſt probable, that
his continual Debauches having exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, together with his great Age,
were the occaſion of his Immature
Death.</p>
            <p>By the Conſequence of this Hiſtory,
ſhewing the irregular Conduct of the
greateſt part of the Queens Officers, it
is eaſie to judge of the great Diſorders
which reign'd in her Quarter. This was
one of the ſpecious Pretences of Pope
<hi>Innocent</hi> XI. to abrogate the Franchiſes
of the Queens, and Ambaſſadors Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
as if there had been no way to ſtop
the Diſorders of particular Perſons,
but by taking away the Rights of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns.
But the Pope found more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
in the Execution, than he had
foreſeen in the Project. He renewed
the Bulls of the Popes his Predeceſſors
about the Revocation of Franchiſes,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:54799:121"/>
but no Body deſiſted; he remonſtrated
to Ambaſſadors, That the Diſſorders
committed in <hi>Rome,</hi> came from the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities
of Quarters; and that they
had authoriz'd the Fault by protecting
the Criminals. But ſeeing they gave no
heed to him, he ſpoke to the Princes of
<hi>Europe</hi> by his Nuncio's, in which they
ſucceeded no better than the Pope had
done. For the Ambaſſadours wrote to
their Maſters, and they took the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances
to come as from Perſons ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
to act in favour of their own
Intereſts.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, if the Princes
themſelves had faithfully underſtood
the Diſorders committed in theſe Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
it is not to be imagin'd they would
have much inſiſted upon thoſe Immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
for no Body can perſwade himſelf
that any Prince has pretended by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Franchiſes of their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors,
to make them a Retreat to
Thieves, Aſſaſſins, and Debauch'd Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
They would without doubt give
orders to remit them into the Hands of
Juſtice, though refug'd in their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or their Palaces themſelves. But
ſeeing the Affair advanc'd not, the Pope
was forc'd with diſpleaſure to expect
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:54799:122"/>
that from Time which he could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
by Force. He reſerv'd himſelf
therefore for a better Opportunity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
that when Princes ſhould recall
their Ambaſſadors, he would receive no
others, till ſuch time as they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
theſe Franchiſes. This way was
eaſier, though longer about, and it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
better than the violent Courſes
he had took. <hi>Spain</hi> by and by recall'd
the Marquiſs <hi>Del Carpio</hi> her Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
to ſend thither the Viceroy of
<hi>Naples,</hi> in the beginning of the Year
1683. The Pope immediately after his
Departure, ſent all his Sbirries to take
poſſeſſion of his Quarter, in the Place
<hi>d'Eſpaign,</hi> and ſcowr'd it of all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors
that were retired thither. The
Quarters of the Ambaſſadors of <hi>Venice</hi>
and <hi>Portugal</hi> were recover'd in the ſame
manner; that is to ſay, by the Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of thoſe that poſſeſs'd them. Prince
<hi>Radzeville</hi> the Ambaſſador of <hi>Poland,</hi>
who made his Entry in the Year 1680.
and the Lord <hi>Caſtlemain</hi> Ambaſſador of
<hi>England,</hi> in the Year 1686, were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them acknowledg'd in this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
till they had declar'd that they
would not pretend to Franchiſes, or
Quarters. The Pope would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54799:122"/>
the Marquiſs <hi>Cogliudo</hi> Son of the
Duke of <hi>Medina Caeli,</hi> new Ambaſſador
from <hi>Spain,</hi> but upon the Aſſurances of
the Marquiſs <hi>de les Balbazes,</hi> that this
Ambaſſador ſhould pretend neither to
Franchiſe nor Quarter, in caſe other
Ambaſſadors did likewiſe renounce them.</p>
            <p>There was none now at <hi>Rome</hi> which
enjoyed either Franchiſes or Quarters,
but the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, which gave
occaſion for a Song which was then in
faſhion, whoſe Ends ſounded like one
another in two Syllables.</p>

            <p>No ſooner was the Duke <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi>
Dead, towards the end of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1687.
but the Sbirries came preſently and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
at the Palace of <hi>Farneſe,</hi> and
took Poſſeſſion of the Quarter. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
the Cardinal <hi>d'Eſtrees</hi> who receiv'd
this Loſs of his Illuſtrious Brother, like
a true Chriſtian, with the Sentiments of
an enlightned Soul, did not think of
maintaining the Right of the Franchiſes,
believing that there was no preſcription
in the caſe, and that the King being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
eſtabliſhed in the Enjoyment of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:54799:123"/>
Quarters than any other Prince, would
have time enough to repreſs thoſe who
pretended to take them away; and ſo
his Eminence immediately left the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
<hi>Farneſe,</hi> and went to Lodge at the
Vineyard of <hi>Pamphilio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi>
was the only Perſon remaining, who had
any Poſſeſſion of Quarters; and they
preſently became the moſt frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Langara</hi> which was the
moſt deſert, became now the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
part of the City. So that all
Lewd People being retir'd thither, there
was every Day new Stories, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in <hi>Rome</hi> was more talk'd of, than
the Adventures of <hi>Langara.</hi> The Pope
who was very ſenſible of it, ſometimes
ſpoke to Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to the Queen, expreſſing his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments,
but it was all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>After all, he ſaw plain enough that
notwithſtanding all his Endeavours, he
had done nothing, as long as there was
any Aſylum, or place of Refuge, left for
Criminals to fly to. But at laſt the
Queen by the Meaſures of ill concerted
Politicks, remitted her Right of Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes
into the Pope's Hand, of which
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:54799:124"/>
ſhe was not long before ſhe repented.
She knew well enough that her Title to
theſe Immunities was not over well
founded; nor durſt ſhe pretend to them,
in either of the Voyages which ſhe made
to <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Year 1655. and 1659.
and yet ſhe ſhewed afterwards as great a
difficulty to part with them, than if
they had been the Rights of her Crown.
Neither had ſhe over-done it at all, if
the unfetled State of her Affairs had not
engag'd her to endeavour to manage
the Pope in favour of her own Intereſts.

            <p>This good Princeſs did believe ſhe
ſhould bring the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> to
agree; and that her Example would
cauſe even <hi>France</hi> to give up her Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes;
but ſhe was miſtaken, for the
Moſt Chriſtian King while theſe things
were in doing ſent the Marquiſs <hi>de La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vardin</hi>
his Ambaſſadour to the Pope.
This Miniſter entred <hi>Rome</hi> the 16th of
<hi>Novembor</hi> 1687. and went to live at the
Palace <hi>Farneſe,</hi> where he re-eſtabliſhed
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:54799:125"/>
the Franchiſes of his Quarter, during all
the time of his Abode, upon the ſame
foot his Predeceſſors had enjoy'd them
time out of mind.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak the truth, the Pope's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
had never contraven'd the
Rights of <hi>France;</hi> for they knew too well
from whom they had the Patrimony of
St. <hi>Peter.</hi> They acknowledg'd the Kings
of <hi>France</hi> as the only Pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ectors of the
Holy See; <hi>Pepin</hi> and <hi>Charlemagne</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
highly declar'd themſelves againſt
the Enemies of the Popes, and made it
their proper buſineſs to enter into War
in their behalf: They themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd
on them the Exarchal of <hi>Raven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
and the other Provinces of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony
of the Holy Foundation of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> after the Defeat of
all their Enemies: So that all this, and
an infinite number of other Services
which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> had render'd
the Church, made Popes to diſtinguiſh
them from all the Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi>
'Tis true, that notwithſtanding all this,
the Ingratitude of Prieſts is ſo great,
that there is no Statue of <hi>Pepin</hi> or <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemagne</hi>
to be found in <hi>Rome,</hi> nor the
leaſt Inſcription in their Honour. If
Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. had no mind to hear
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:54799:125"/>
the recital of all theſe Donations, nor
ſearch into Antiquity unknown to him,
he might at leaſt have call'd to Memory
the Treaty of <hi>Piſa,</hi> concluded in theſe
Days, wherein the Poſſeſſion of the
Franchiſes were confirmed to the <hi>French.</hi>
But the Spirit of Partiality, which
ought never to reign in the Common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Chriſtians, hindred <hi>Innocent</hi> XI.
from entring into theſe Reaſons, and
made him puſh on things to a Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Extremity. If he had as ſoon gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Audience to the Marquiſs <hi>de Lavar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi>
or Monſieur <hi>Chanelay</hi> Envoy of
<hi>France;</hi> as to the Envoy of the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> he had known the true Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of <hi>France.</hi> All the World knows
that this Miniſter had order to remit
the Franchiſes, if the Pope would have
given him a preſent Audience, but not
being able to obtain that, which was
yet accorded to a Proteſtant, he would
not yield up his inconteſtable Rights.
But this drives us off <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oo far from our
Subject; we will therefore return to ſee
the Conſequences of the Queens diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of her Franchiſes, which coſt her
ſo much Diſpleaſure and Uneaſineſs.
We ſhall underſtand it beſt from the
following Relation which was ſent me
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:54799:126"/>
from <hi>Leghorn,</hi> by a <hi>French</hi> Officer of
the Queen's, who went thither to ſeek
for an Employ. As he was Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Confident after <hi>Clairet's</hi> Death,
no Body knew the Queen's Secrets bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than himſelf; and therefore having
deſir'd him to inſtruct me, as to what
paſs'd upon that occaſion, I ſhall relate
it according to the Words of his own
Writing.</p>
            <p>The Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd,
and afterwards written an elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
Letter to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the XI.
(wherein ſhe makes the Reſignation with
a great deal of Zeal to pleaſe his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs)
quickly ſaw her Error, and the
Injury ſhe had thereby done to her ſelf.
For whether it were that ſhe had not
uſed all the Precautions that were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to make this Action valuable, or
pretended that the Pope ought to have
given her thanks, or rather becauſe her
People were accuſtom'd to an inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Liberty, and could not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
within Bounds; but ſo it was,
that the Ceſſion of the Franchiſe did not
laſt above two Months, before the
Queen receiv'd Diſcontent and Vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from it every way.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that was ſeen was a
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:54799:126"/>
Battallion of <hi>Sbirries,</hi> with their Bari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeil
at the Head of them, to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of the Quarter with inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Pride. The Pope made theſe Scoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drels
inſolent by the Power given them,
and it was the reaſon that we look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them with Contempt; and it did ſo
much the more mortifie all the Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
in that they were not us'd to
be vex'd with ſuch Rogues with whom
they had never any thing to do before.</p>
            <p>At laſt happen'd an Accident which
was the Cauſe of all the Miſchief that
might be foreſeen. A Valet of one of
the Queen's Anſpeſſades, had cheated a
Banker of ſome Barrels of Brandy;
and the <hi>Sbirri</hi>'s, whether of their own
Motion, or excited by ſome of the
Queen's Enemies, took him Priſoner
upon <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Day, near the Queen's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and dragg'd him as far as the
Steps of the Church <hi>de Regina Coeli,</hi>
which is at <hi>Longara.</hi> Many Footmen,
and others of the Queen's Domeſticks,
who went to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s for their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
cry'd out to the <hi>Sbirri</hi>'s as they
went along, that it was a ſhame to take
him upon <hi>Easter</hi>-Day, without regard
to the Sanctity of the Feſtival.</p>
            <p>This did not terrifie them at all; for
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:54799:127"/>
they brought their Priſoner to a Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,
keeping him by main force, though
they remonſtrated to them that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd
to her Majeſty. The Queen
having underſtood it, ſent to diſengage
him, being angry that they had not
ask'd her permiſſion to take him. He
was taken away by force, out of the
hands of theſe Raſcals, and brought
back in Triumph to <hi>Langara,</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
crying out <hi>Vivat</hi> to the Queen, and
Hooting at the <hi>Sbirri</hi>'s. But this caus'd
a great Noiſe; for the Pope taking
Offence, that they had committed Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to the Miniſters of his Juſtice, and
enterpriz'd upon his Authority, made
a Criminal Proceſs againſt all thoſe
that had a ſhare in this buſineſs, and
condemned them all as ſeditious.</p>
            <p>The Queen being ſtark mad to ſee the
<hi>Placards,</hi> ſtuck upon the Walls of her
Palace, wherein the pretended Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
were condemn'd to Death for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy,
and their Heads ſet at a Price,
kept no farther meaſures with the Pope;
and to brave him, took the occaſion of
a Feaſt which the Jeſuits made, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhe
went with a magnificent Train, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by all her Domeſticks, arm'd
like ſo many St. <hi>Georges</hi> under their
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:54799:127"/>
Habits: The Condemn'd had order to
follow her Majeſty at the ſides of her
Coach, with the three accus'd <hi>Auſpeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades,</hi>
and nine others, which made up
the number of a dozen all well-arm'd,
and reſolute to the uttermoſt.</p>
            <p>I remember poor Captain <hi>Landini</hi>
who had before paſs'd for a Man of
Courage, conſidering the danger, fell
a trembling when he went out of the
Port <hi>Settignana;</hi> and whereas he ſhould
have follow'd the Queen at the Head
of the <hi>Auſpeſſades,</hi> was forc'd to be put
into one of the Queen's Coaches, being
as pale as a dead Man. However they
ſeem'd to take no notice of it at the
Apoſtolick Palace, but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the Pope regal'd her Majeſty with
ſome Baſons of Fruit, the firſt of which,
I remember, was green Raiſins, a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for the Month of <hi>May,</hi> as then it
was. A Chamberlain of Honour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
them to the Queen, who gave
him no more than ordinary Thanks;
but after he was gone, look'd upon me,
and ſaid, What does <hi>Mingon</hi> mean with
his Raiſins? She ſpoke of the Pope;
who, being of an auſtere Temper, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
almoſt every Favour asked of
him, with this Word <hi>Minga;</hi> which
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:54799:128"/>
is as much as to ſay, No, or not at all, in
the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> Language, or in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
of <hi>Spain,</hi> from whence the Queen
gave him the Nick-name of <hi>Mingon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Does he think, ſaid ſhe, we are aſleep,
No, I will vex him in my turn. She
then gave Orders, that as many <hi>Sbirries</hi>
as paſs'd by her Quarter. ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up. One <hi>Merula,</hi> a <hi>Neopolitan Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi>
whom the Queen had taken from
Juſtice, which would have puniſh'd him
for ſome Crimes committed in the
Realm of <hi>Naples,</hi> was her Bravo. And
indeed this Man, though but of few
Words, was a wicked Devil; for he
would Kill a Man upon the leaſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
or for Money, if you pleas'd.
There was then a Corporal of the <hi>Sbir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
who had Inſolence enough to ſpeak
ſome ill things of the Queen, and to
boaſt an Exploit which he had done in
her Quarter; but he did not live long
after this Temerity, for he was Kill'd
by <hi>Merula,</hi> at Noon day, as he was
going out of his Houſe, near the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's
of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Pope enrag'd at
the Death of this Man, redoubl'd his
Edicts againſt the Queen's People; and
and came to ſuch a point of Choler,
that he propos'd in a Conſiſtory to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:54799:128"/>
the Queen. But Monſieur
the Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtrees</hi> ſo ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to his Holineſs, that he muſt
have more circumſpection in regard of
Crown'd Heads; and that it could not
be prov'd that the Queen was the cauſe
of it, that it hinder'd his Holineſs from
coming to this Extremity. And 'tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that the Queen, who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
vexed his Eminence upon many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
found no body but him to
maintain her Intereſts, for I think Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Azzolini</hi> was then Sick. In the
mean time, things grew worſe and
worſe, inſomuch, that the Queen having
underſtood that the Pope would ſend
all the <hi>Sbirries</hi> to carry away the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
by force out of her Palace, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
the Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte</hi> to give
Notice to all her Houſhold to be in her
Palace on Sunday after Maſs. All the
Domeſticks were there, and above all,
the Gentlemen were the firſt that heard
the Queen's Speech.</p>
            <p>She ſaid,</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">Gentlemen, and all you others my
Domeſticks, I have brought you hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to tell you, That the <hi>Pope</hi> is
coming to the Sword's Point with
me, by forcing my Domeſticks, your</hi>

               <hi rend="margQuotes">Comerades, into the hands of Juſtice;
I am reſolv'd not to forſake them,
and therefore thoſe that are in my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
muſt prepare themſelves to run
the ſame Fortune with me, and to
repulſe couragioſly thoſe Violences
that will be offer'd; I will be at your
Head, and expos'd to the ſame Perils
with all of you. You know me, and
underſtand by ſome Actions of my
Life, that I am not Fearful; let thoſe
that have not Courage to ſerve me,
declare it, for I will force no body.
I know the Pope is your Sovereign,
and if any Intereſt oblige you to retire,
thoſe that have a mind, may do it
freely; I had rather have ten Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Men, who are willing, and will
be Faithful, than a thouſand timerous
Perſons and Cowards, who for fear of
prejudicing their Affairs, are not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

               </gap>d the Speech, but
you might ſee by their Faces, that one
half of them could have wiſh'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
far enough off. I was a File<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſer,
or the laſt Man that brings up
the Ranks, and caſt my ſelf at the
Queen's Feet, aſſuring her, that any
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:54799:129"/>
Intereſt of the Family, ſhould make my
ſpend the laſt drop of my Blood in her
Service. Go my poor <hi>N.</hi> ſaid ſhe to me,
I know thou ſpeakeſt from thy Heart,
and one time or other, I will take an
opportunity to let thee know, that I
am fully perſwaded of it. Not I alone,
Madam, (ſaid I) but all the <hi>French</hi> that
are in <hi>Rome,</hi> will take it for a Glory, to
die in your Majeſty's Service. I know
ſaid ſhe, the <hi>French</hi> Nation loves me,
and as I always Eſteem them, I ſhall free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
receive their Service. The good Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
in a Tranſport, fell into a Panegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick
upon the <hi>French</hi> Nation, exalting
to the Skies, their Fidelity and Love to
their King, and for all the Princes they
took an inclination to Serve.</p>
            <p>The Pope, when he underſtood the
Queen's Reſolutions, fell a Laughing,
as he had reaſon. Nevertheleſs, ſome
of the Court-Prelates took the liberty
to repreſent to the Pope, that if he
puſh'd things to extremity, he would
cauſe a Mutiny among the People, and
eſpecially by the <hi>French,</hi> who were not
well ſatisfied about the Proceedings of the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and having but the leaſt
Pretence, ſuch as that of the Queen's was,
would blindly follow her Will. 'Tis
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:54799:130"/>
certain that theſe Reflections did a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſlacken the Court-Reſolutions. But
while theſe things were doing, the
Queen call'd to me after Dinner. At
firſt when I came, I fell on my Knees
before her, as ſhe was ſitting on a Couch.
I ſend for you now, ſaid ſhe, becauſe I
would be ſeen by no body elſe, for now
every one is at Reſt, becauſe of the
Heat. And indeed there was no body
about her. I remember (purſu'd her
Majeſty) what you ſaid to me ſome days
ago: The Pope continues his Anger,
and though he be Pope, I will make him
remember I am Queen. You know all the
<hi>French</hi> which are in this City; manage
them, for I ſhall have occaſion, and I
eſteem an hundred <hi>French,</hi> more than
a thouſand <hi>Italians.</hi> I have already
provided (ſaid I, Madam) the gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ter
past of the <hi>French,</hi> which I eſteem the
moſt Brave, and who have no ſettlement
in <hi>Rome,</hi> but ſeek for ſome Buſineſs, or
an occaſion to ſhew their Bravery. Your
Majeſty knows, that as the <hi>French</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is Perſecuted at <hi>Rome</hi> under this
Pontificate, becauſe of the Differences
between the two Courts, upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the Regalia, and the four Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of the Clergy of <hi>France;</hi> So,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:54799:130"/>
Madam, the profound Veneration which
the <hi>French</hi> have for your Majeſty, and
Hatred to the Pope, will make them
enterprize all things. If your Majeſty
will be ſo kind to permit me to do it,
I will bring you Fifty, all good Men,
who ſhall paſs under your View, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their knowing of it.</p>
            <p>The Queen approved my Deſign;
and the way I took was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s. Whereas,
her Majeſty's Palace was adorn'd with
precious Moveables, fine Pictures, and
excellent Statues, which were inviting
to Strangers. It was not difficult for
me to bring whole ſhoals t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſee theſe
Rarities at certain Hours. A <hi>Valet de
Chambre,</hi> who was a Confident, had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to leave all Open; So I brought in
every time Nine or Ten Perſons; and
when I had introduc'd them into the
Chamber of the <hi>Mirroir of Time,</hi> where
all the fine Paintings were; She could
ſee them without being ſeen her ſelf, by
means of certain Windows which were
above, near the Ceiling. One day above
the reſt, I brought in a certain <hi>French</hi>
Grenadier, who had Deſerted; he look'd
upon the Queen's Picture very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and cry'd, <hi>Oh, how great a Queen is
this! Gods Zd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>of her Armies, as heretofore, I would Serve
her willingly.</hi> I ſaid to him, <hi>Monſieur,</hi>
If there ſhould be an occaſion, you would
hardly be of the ſame mind. Yes by G.
anſwers my Brave, <hi>I have h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Comerades beſides, which ſhall be at her
Service.</hi> Well, ſaid I, Gentlemen, you
have ſeen all, let us go and drink her
Majeſty's Health. Judge you whether
I did not do my buſineſs to effect, for
ſhe ſent for me again, and as ſoon as ſhe
ſaw me, ſaid, <hi>Oh, how well things go!
theſe are the People I muſt have: Get in
beſides, ſome Trades-People if you can, for
they are, for the moſt part, as good as Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</hi>
So I went to her Shoemaker and
her Taylor, who had got ten Boys a
piece, all Merry Lads. I declar'd my
ſelf to their Maſters, and as I could
truſt them with the Secret, I told the
Lads, that the Queen had given me a
Piſtol to make them Drink. Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
who would ſee all, made me
bring them into a great Cabbaret, at
the Port <hi>Settignana,</hi> over againſt one of
her Apartments, where ſhe could both
ſee and hear us. We were there in the
Afternoon under a Tree, which caſt a
great Shade: There was an Arbor in
the Branches, and Banks round about,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:54799:131"/>
into the Apartment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> of which Places
you muſt enter by a Wooden Bridge,
where there was Conveniencies for 20
Men, without incommoding one another.
Theſe Merry Blades began to Sing and
drink the Queen's Health: She heard
all, and took a great deal of Pleaſure
in the Applauſes given her: ſo that ſhe
ſent a Footman, who gave order to the
Landlord, to diſtribute a dozen Bottles
of Wine, to redouble her Healths. This
Surpriz'd me, becauſe I would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
this Affair with all the Secrecy
imaginable, till ſuch time as I had
brought the Train to Perfection. I
ſaw her Majeſty next day, and ſhe told
me all went well. Madam, ſaid I to
her, I manage my People, and do not
declare my ſelf, but to thoſe that I am
ſure will make no noiſe, till the time
comes, according to your Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſty's
Orders; But if I durſt, I would ask,
on whoſe behalf it was, that we were
Yeſterday Regal'd with a dozen Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
of Wine, becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e I am apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive

The Queen, whoſe intention it was to
make a noiſe, fell a L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ghing, and told
me, ſhe was very well pleas'd with my
Conduct. And to make ſhort, in three
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:54799:132"/>
or four days time I was aſſur'd of four
or five Hundred Men. The <hi>Pope,</hi> who
had Notice given him, that the Queen
Fortified her ſelf, and knew very well
that the <hi>French</hi> were ill ſatisfied with
their hard Uſage, began to fear ſome
Riſing; but his Humour being ſevere
and inflexible, he did not come to any
terms of Accomodation. Yet at laſt,
by the means of Monſieur <hi>Albani,</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of the Briefs, who Succeeded
Cardinal <hi>Siuſius,</hi> and wore the Purple
by his proper Merit, who was of great
Credit with the Queen, and to whom
the Pope always liſtned, and the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of Cardinal <hi>Azzolini,</hi> things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſweeten and come into a better
temper. <hi>Albani</hi> went to vlſit the Queen
as from himſelf, and at firſt talk'd about
things indifferent, but inſenſibly fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Quarrel between the Pope and
the Queen. She complain'd, that the
<hi>Pope</hi> treated her with Rigour; and the
Prelate aſſur'd her M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>jeſty, that his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
were good, but complain'd that
her Majeſty ſuffer'd her ſelf to be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd
by certain People of her Court,
who proceeded contrary to his Intereſts.
<hi>Then we are both equal in the matter,</hi> ſaith
the Queen briſkly, <hi>for he is more poſſeſs'd
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:54799:132"/>
than I, ſeeing his Miniſters create Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to all People.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Albani</hi> ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the matter as well as he could, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
to her Majeſty, that what
anger'd the <hi>Pope</hi> moſt, was, that it ſeem'd
to him as if the Queen had a mind to
make a Sedition in <hi>Rome,</hi> by raiſing the
People. <hi rend="margQuotes">I had no ſuch thought (ſaid ſhe)
for I know too well my Duty towards
His Holineſs to do any thing of that
nature; But I would take ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
that may put him in mind who
I am. I own, that among Strangers
and the People of <hi>Rome,</hi> I find ſome
whoſe Minds are more inclinable to
me, than the preſent Government;
nor does it belong to me to reform
it; But however, I will at leaſt take
care, that my Domeſticks be not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away from me, and my Palace
Rifled before my Face, as I have been
threatned, and know not how ſoon it
may be executed.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Albani</hi>
concluded, that the Pope could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
what he had done; but if her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
would permit the formalities of
Juſtice to be done, it were not difficult
to find ſuch a Temper, that no body
might receive any harm, and that the
culpable being condemn'd by Juſtice,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:54799:133"/>
might be Pardon'd again, becauſe the
Pope's Authority would ſuffer damage,
if he acted otherwiſe. <hi rend="margQuotes">And my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
(ſaid the Queen) would be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
if I ſhould act in any other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
and if I were to begin again,
the Pope ſhould not have ſo free Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
and Condeſcentions,
ſeeing I have made my ſelf Enemies to
pleaſe him; But now Crown'd Heads
are well agreed, it is in his power to
give me a Diſturbance. But (ſaid ſhe
to conclude) things are not yet paſt
remedy, for my own part, if an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
can be found to ſave my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
I will give him both my
hands to what he pleaſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, things continued in this
poſture till the coming of the Marquiſs
<hi>Lavardin,</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> with
whom ſhe found it convenient to unite
her Intereſts, becauſe he was the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
of a Potent Prince, who was ill
ſatisfied in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> She ſaid
a thouſand good things by way of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and ſpoke of him always in the
moſt Obliging terms. As for Inſtance,
That the King of <hi>France</hi> could not have
made a better choice, than to have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
a Perſon of ſo much Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:54799:133"/>
as himſelf. That being moſt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
in the buſineſs of Ambaſſages, he
would cauſe the reſpect due to his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
to be eaſily paid him, and other
things of the like nature. Her main end
was to join her ſelf to him, to obtain
Satisfaction of the Pope, ſuppoſing ſhe
could not make her own Accomodation
apart; For notwithſtanding theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
Unions, they would eaſily ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
and forſake one another, to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their own Affairs. But the Pope,
who did not like this Ambaſſage, and
would never acknowledge him, made
<hi>Lavardin</hi> (ſeeing himſelf forſaken by all)
very glad to unite with the Queen, who
was alſo in the ſame Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>The day that this Ambaſſador made
his Entry into <hi>Rome,</hi> the Queen under
moſt rigorous Penalties, forbad all her
Officers and Domeſticks to ſee it. But
I who knew by her Eyes, that ſhe made
this Prohibition contrary to her Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
asked leave by the Marquiſs <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni,</hi>
as being a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> to go and
ſee this Entry: She granted it in the
Preſence of the Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte,</hi> with
this condition, that I ſhould obſerve
very well all that paſs'd, and give her
an Account as ſoon as it was done. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:54799:134"/>
I had ſeen all, I came to give a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the Particulars as well as I
could; and remaining alone with her

<hi>D' Eſtrees,</hi> did not fail to manage
all their Intrigues either to bend or

of his Holineſs having renvers'd all the
Projects of the <hi>French,</hi> and the Pope
having refus'd to receive a Letter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with the King's own hand, brought
Expreſs by Monſieur <hi>Chanelay,</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in ordinary of his Chamber. Things
broke without return, and made the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador

               </gap>een. They who deſire a thing,
do eaſily believe it, or ſeem ſo to do.
Two or three days were ſcarce paſt,
but there run a Report, that the Courts
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:54799:134"/>
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rom</hi> were juſt upon agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and at the ſame time arriv'd a
Courier from <hi>France,</hi> as 'twas ſaid, about
the Vacancy of Benefices, but no Body
knew what the Letters imported. The
Queen being in ſuſpence, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what to believe, deſir'd me to bring
her the Courier, whom I was Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with. I pretended to ſhew him all
the Rarities of the Queen's Apartment.
He came, and I conducted him through
all Places, till we came to the Chamber
of <hi>Mirroir,</hi> where the Queen Surpriz'd
us, at it were by chance; She queſtion'd
the Courier very much, but being one
of the Cabinet, and a Man of Wit, ſhe
could only draw from him ſome general
things.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, ſhe never left to
ſpeak a thouſand good things of the
Ambaſſador, and the Ambaſſador of the
Queen, and I found out an Invention to
bring them a little nearer one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
I told her Majeſty, that Madam
the Ambaſſadreſs had brought the fineſt
Habits in the World along with her:
And ſhe let me know that ſhe was very
deſirous to have a ſight of them I made
the Ambaſſadreſs acquainted with it, and
ſhe fail'd not to ſend them to the Queen,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:54799:135"/>
and ſhe ſaid, ſhe was much pleas'd with
them, but ſhould have been better to
ſee them upon the Perſon for whom
they were made. Madam <hi>de Laverdin</hi>
underſtood this, and was mightily pleas'd
with the Eſteem the Queen had for her.
For the poor Lady, in the Miſ-intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
between the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and
her Husband, ſaw no body which gave
her the Title of Excellence, out of her
own Palace, nor treated her as Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadreſs,
and therefore died with long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſee her ſelf Honour'd with theſe
Titles by ſo great a Queen. I Din'd at
the Ambaſſadors ſome time after, and
by way of Entertainment, it was ask'd
me how her Majeſty would treat Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
the Ambaſſador if he ſhould do her
the Honour of a Viſit. I anſwer'd that
I knew not the Queen's Secrets, but yet
I durſt promiſe, that her Majeſty would
treat him according to his Character.
The ſame Night I ſaw the Queen, and
ſaid, Madam, dare I enquire of your
Majeſty, how you will treat Monſieur
<hi>de Laverdin,</hi> if he gives you the Honour
of rendring his Devoirs. <hi rend="margQuotes">I would
treat him (ſaid ſhe) as all other Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors
of <hi>France;</hi> or in ſhort, how
he pleaſes.</hi> She let him know it alſo
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:54799:135"/>
by other means; and the ſame Night I
went to tell the Ambaſſador's Confident
what the Queen had ſaid: And after
ſome few days, a <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> of
Monſieur the Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtrees,</hi> call'd
<hi>Conſtant,</hi> met me going over the Bridge
of <hi>Ponte Siſta,</hi> and told me, that the next
day Monſieur the Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi>
would come to Viſit her Majeſty. I
flew preſently to tell her, and as ſoon
as ſhe ſaw me, ask'd me: <hi>Well,
what News? Madam,</hi> (ſaid I, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very low to her) <hi>Monſieur the
Ambaſſador will come to Morrow to Viſit
you.</hi> She was much ſurpriz'd at theſe
words, and ſaid, <hi>Ah</hi> N—<hi>the Affection
you have for me, makes you deſire theſe
things. No, Madam,</hi> (anſwer'd I) <hi>there's
nothing ſo true, I have ſeen the Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and was told it by a Friend. My Child,</hi>
(ſaid ſhe) <hi>I have no News of all this, and
I believe the Orders of the Court are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
but ſay nothing, to Morrow we ſhall
know all.</hi> I could not Sleep all that
Night, and the next Day went to the
Queens Levee, and ſhe caſt ſo many
Glances at me, that I was quite put out
of Countenance; but ſhe was ſcarce
cloath'd before <hi>Monſieur de la Bruſſiere</hi>
Maſter of <hi>Monſieur de Lavardin</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:54799:136"/>
came to tell Her Majeſty, that
Monſieur the Ambaſſador deſir'd the
Honour of paying his Reſpects to her,
and doing his Devoirs.</p>
            <p>One may eaſily believe that the
Queen gave a good Anſwer to this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
Meſſage, ſaying that Monſieur
the Ambaſſadour was perfectly Maſter
to come when he pleas'd, and that he
ſhould be receiv'd, according both to his
Character and his Merit. The Viſit
was great and magnificent, and they
ſpoke an hundred obliging things, and
full of eſteem one for another, and in
the praiſe of that great Monarch Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Lavardin</hi> repreſented. This Viſit
entertain'd all the City with Diſcourſe
for ſome time, and all the Queens Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
became good <hi>French</hi> Men. Madam
the Ambaſſadreſs came alſo to ſee the
Queen, and was well receiv'd; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this, there was nothing ſo frequent
as the Coaches of the Ambaſſador and
his Lady in the Queens Court.</p>
            <p>I had forgot one Circumſtance, which
is, that while this Enterview was treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Her Majeſty went one Day to the
Colledge of St. <hi>Clement,</hi> to hear ſome
Academical Diſcourſes, in Proſe and
Verſe, with a recitation in Muſick, and
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:54799:136"/>
it was at the time of the Carneval, <hi>Anno</hi>
1688. when all Rejoycings were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
by the Pope's Authority. I told
the Confident of Monſieur the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador,
that the Queen in returning
home, would paſs by the Palace <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe;</hi>
which Monſieur <hi>de Lavardin</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
aſſembled all his Guards
Marine, together with his whole Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
and made a double Hedge, in the
middle of which the Queen paſs'd with
all her Train, with Flambeaus lighted.
Monſieur the Ambaſſador, Madam the
Ambaſſadreſs, Madamoſel their Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and a little Child a Daughter of
theirs, were upon the Balcony, where
they made a profound Reverence to the
Queen; ſhe re-ſaluted them with her
Hand, and all the Nobles with their
Hats off accompanied Her Majeſty as
far as <hi>Ponte-Siſto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, the whole Carriage of the
Thing was Agreeable and Magnificent
on both ſides; for the Queen had one
of the fineſt Coaches in <hi>Rome,</hi> and a
Chair of the ſame, all her Footmen
and twelve Anſpeſſades at the back of
them, and all illuminated by twenty ſix
Flambeaus in White Wax.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:54799:137"/>
It was again inquir'd, how Madamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<hi>Lavardin</hi> ſhould be treated if ſhe
came to kiſs Her Majeſties Hands. The
Queen ask'd me from whom I brought
that Queſtion, and whether Monſieur
the Ambaſſador made this Demand?
<hi>No, Madam,</hi> (I anſwer'd) <hi>it is a Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
that waits upon Madamoſel</hi> Lavardin.
<hi>They are not very knowing in the Ceremonial
Law,</hi> (ſaid the Queen;) <hi>If Madamoſel</hi>
Lavardin <hi>comes to ſee me, I muſt ſtand
upon Niceties; but becauſe we will not
come to that, I will go abroad for her ſake,
and we will meet one another in a Church
or Religious Monaſtery, and I will carry
her to ſee the finest Convents in</hi> Rome,
<hi>that I will treat her with all Civility, and
make her ſit in my Preſence next my ſelf.</hi>
This was done, and the Young Lady
was entirely ſatisfied in Her Majeſties
Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>One Day the Queen would have me
to watch when the Ambaſſadour paſs'd
by <hi>Longara,</hi> to go to the fine Garden
of Cardinal <hi>Barberini,</hi> which is near the
Gate <hi>de Spirito Santo.</hi> After I knew, I
gave notice to Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> on
Her Majeſties part, who was to come
to meet him as it were by Chance, and
they met one another over-againſt the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:54799:137"/>
Monaſtery call'd <hi>Regina Celi,</hi> where there
paſs'd a great many Civilities between
them, and the Cardinal treated the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
<hi>de Lavardin</hi> with the Title of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence
and Ambaſſadour, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of a great number of People who
waited on purpoſe to ſee how they
would Salute one another. I caus'd
the Ambaſſador's Trumpets to come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
into the Queens Garden, where
they Play'd moſt excellently, and were
gratified with ten Piſtols from the
Queen, and Monſieur the Ambaſſador
extoll'd this Liberality to the Skies.</p>
            <p>The Queen being deſirous to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the Difference that was between
the Cardinals <hi>Azzolini</hi> and <hi>D'Eſtrees,</hi>
could not bring it about, and was ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
at it, that to be reveng'd ſhe ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
remonſtrated to the Ambaſſador,
That the hot Councils of Cardinal
<hi>D'Eſtrees</hi> had exaſperated Matters, and
would cauſe him to make falſe ſteps;
that ſuch a Man as he had no need ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Counſeller or Pedant, and that
the Pope was irritated againſt him for
Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtree</hi>'s ſake; that <hi>Azzolini</hi>
was certainly a good Servant of the
King's; and though decried in the Court
of <hi>France,</hi> had always maintain'd a great
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:54799:138"/>
Reſpect for the King; and that if his

would manage things to his Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Lavardin</hi> gave Ear to it,
and look'd coldly upon Cardinal <hi>D'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrees;</hi>
but this incomparable Cardinal,
who had faithful Spies over the Queen,
was immediately inform'd of all, and
ſo with his winning Manners prevented
the Ambaſſador, and ſaid to him;
<hi rend="margQuotes">Monſieur, the Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> is
ſo Inconſtant, and Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi>
ſo great a Deceiver, that if the Pope
do but make the leaſt ſhew of giving
them ſome ſlight ſatisfaction, you
will find the Queen turn her Back of
you. I know, Monſieur, ſhe has told
you, that you may lay aſide my
Counſels, and that you have no need
of a Pedant: But ſince the King has
done me the Honour to communicate
his Affairs to me as, well as your ſelf,
I will always ſpeak my Thoughts,
where the Intereſts of his Eſtates are
tranſacted.</hi> But Monſieur <hi>Lavardin,</hi>
who was of Opinion, that the Court
of <hi>Rome,</hi> was not very fond of the
Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> was well ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with this Remonſtrance; but the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:54799:138"/>
Queen gave <hi>D'Eſtrees</hi> to the Devil,
knowing he had been inform'd of all,
and was never able to diſcover him that
betray'd her. What happen'd after
the Diſcovery of all theſe Intrigues?
The Pope was always obſtinate, and
would hear no body. The Queen died
the 13th of <hi>April,</hi> 1689. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
<hi>de Lavardin</hi> parted from <hi>Rome</hi> into
<hi>France</hi> from whence he came, without
ſeeing the Pope, who died the 12th of

            <p>The Pope was Elected 22th of <hi>April,</hi>
1679. in ſpite of the Queen and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>Azzolini</hi>'s Mind, who had an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

Fortune was not ſo favourable to <hi>Vido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi>
as <hi>Paſquin</hi> alſo had foretold: For
during the Conclave, there was found
a Writing fix'd upon the Gate of the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:54799:140"/>
Pontifical Palace at <hi>Monte Cavallo,</hi> where
was written,
<q>Qui non intrano, ne Facchini, ne Guidoni.</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Azzolini</hi> who hoped to be Secretary
of State under <hi>Vidoni,</hi> as he was under

the Queen, ſo that when Her M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with all her Houſe by the Garden Gate,
which opens towards the Gate of St. <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cras,</hi>
to avoid the Crowd, and entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Bourg of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> by the Gate
of the Light-horſe, from whence ſhe
went directly to the Vatican; but ſhe
had no heart to receive him at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Stairs, ſhe was only in the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:54799:140"/>
Hall, where ſome Prelates were come
before her. After her Compliment
made to the new Pope, which was very
brief, ſhe went back as ſhe came, but ſo
melancholy, that we eaſily knew ſhe was
not content, <hi>Azzolini</hi> having miſs'd his
Blow, quickly found means to adjuſt
his Affairs to the new Regent.</p>
            <p>At this time the Houſe of the <hi>D'Eſtrees</hi>
pretending to an Hat for the Biſhop
and Duke of <hi>Laon</hi> at the Solicitation of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> entred into Cabals with one
another; but the Queen being of a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Spirit, and always an Enemy to
<hi>France,</hi> becauſe they would not yield
to her Sentiments, would with <hi>Azzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lini</hi>
croſs as much as they could the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of the <hi>D'Eſtrees;</hi> and this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
Prelate waited a long time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he would be a Cardinal by his own
Merit, and not put on his Hat at a
price, as was hop'd for by the devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Avarice of the Regent. From hence
began at firſt the Antipathy for the
<hi>D'Eſtrees,</hi> which augmented afterwards
by divers Accidents.</p>
            <p>After the Death of <hi>Clement</hi> X. the
Queen out of Policy writ a Letter to the
Moſt Chriſtian King, by which ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to joyn <hi>Azzolini</hi> to the Faction of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:54799:141"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> for the Election of a Pope; but
they made ſo little account of it, that
they never return'd her an Anſwer, till
two Days after the Election of <hi>Innocent</hi>
XI. the Queen took it with all the ſpight
that could be thought of, and had the
Injuſtice to believe that Cardinal <hi>D'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrees</hi>
was the Cauſe of this Contempt.
She was angry beſides that they did not
give her timely notice of the Queen of
<hi>France'</hi> Death, and for that reaſon
would not wear Mourning; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
changing her Opinion, in favour
of ſo Pious and Holy a Queen, ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
her ſelf in a ſtuff of Goats Hair of
a Violet Colour, which is made no where
but at <hi>Naples,</hi> aud is very dear, and the
Thing of the World, which is the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Mourning.</p>
            <p>But that which moſt augmented the
Queens Rage and her Marquiſan, for
ſo ſhe her ſelf uſed to call <hi>Azzolini,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was of the <hi>Marca de Anchona,</hi>
was the Affair of <hi>Molinos.</hi> He was a
Secular <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Prieſt, and undertook
the direction of Conſciences for twenty
Years in <hi>Rome,</hi> and under this Pretext
brought in a new Hereſie without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a noiſe, which was ſo much the
more pernicious in that, under a ſhew of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:54799:141"/>
Elevating the Mind, to a more ſublime
Contemplation, he would not have us
ſtop at the Humanity of the Word In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate
ſaying, that we ought always
to conſider it in the Boſom of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Father. This made ſome to believe
him to be a conceal'd Jew, of which
there was a great deal of likelihood. In
effect all his Diſcourſes tended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
as much as poſſibly he could the
Ineffable Myſteries of the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Incarnation of the Son of
God. He was againſt all Images, and
renew'd all the Dreams of the Ancient
Iconoclaſticks, condemn'd by ſo many
Orthodox Councils. His Manners were
as corrupt as his Faith, and he would
abuſe the fineſt Women and Maids to
whom he had acceſs, by perſwading
them that Whoredom was no Sin, when
it was not Scandalous. According to
him, Confeſſion was no way neceſſary,
and that Prayer of Quietude aboliſh'd
all ſorts of Sin; ſo the Tribunal of
Penitence, was no more frequented, and
the moſt Devout to outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
whom he had ſeduced, approach'd
the Holy Table, as ſoon as ever they
came to Church, without putting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the trouble of an Abſolution;
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:54799:142"/>
this abominable Rogue, all the while re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
at the horrible Sacriledges he
committed.</p>
            <p>But there is no need I ſhould enlarge
my ſelf any further in things which are
known to all the World, nor upon the
Important Service Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtrees</hi>

               </gap>ender'd the Church, in advertiſing the
Holy Office of this Infamous Heretick,
who had infatuated all the principal
Perſonages in <hi>Rome,</hi> as far as the Queen
of <hi>Sweden,</hi> nay even as far as Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi>
XI. who believed him a Saint, and
would have made him a Cardinal in a
few Days. The Method Cardinal
<hi>D'Eſtrees</hi> took to Arreſt <hi>Molinos,</hi> was a
piece of conſummate Prudence, and any
other Perſon but himſelf, who ſhould
have declar'd it, would have ſuffer'd him
to eſcape. It was upon a <hi>Thurſday</hi> that
the Congregation of the Holy Office was
held before the Pope, where after they
had expedited the Affairs which lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Table, Monſieur the Cardinal
<hi>D'Eſtrees</hi> demanded and obtain'd Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Pope, and the Sacred Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
about a thing of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;
and every one being ſilent,
ſaid, That one of the moſt pernicious
of Hereſies was form'd in <hi>Rome,</hi> and if
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:54799:142"/>
a prompt Remedy were not applyed,
there was an end of all Religion. But
that he who was the Author, had ſo great
Credit even in the Sacred Colledge,
(meaning <hi>Azzolini</hi> without naming him)
that he would eſcape as ſoon as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
was ended, if ſufficient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions
were not taken thereupon.
And therefore he requir'd the Pope's
Order to ſeize the Perſon he would
name, and bring him to the Priſons of
the Holy Office, before the Aſſembly
ſhould ſeparate.</p>
            <p>This being agreed to, Monſieur the
Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtrees,</hi> named <hi>Molinos,</hi> as
the moſt deteſtable of Hereticks, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning
the Pope to keep his Word, and
cauſe him to be Arreſted, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to conduct him to the Priſons of
the Holy Office. The Pope had a mind
to take his part, and to juſtiſie his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
before hand: But the Cardinal
proteſted, that if he intended to act
for the Glory of God, he ought not to
looſe one Moment; and when they
were aſſur'd of his Perſon, he might
give him time enough to juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:54799:143"/>
Upon theſe Remonſtrances the Pope

            <p>In the mean time the Cardinal <hi>D'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrees</hi>
kept <hi>Azzolini</hi> always in his Eye,
for fear he ſhould go away, and give

            <p>This wicked Perſon had the addreſs
to inſinuate himſelf into the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Perſons in <hi>Rome,</hi> among whom
he ſpread his Venom more or leſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

He had ſeduc'd and infected al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> where they
look'd upon him as a Saint, even as far
as the Queen her ſelf, who gave him
Audience for three Hours every <hi>Monday.</hi>
'Tis certain that the Queens Houſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a great deal of eaſe by his means,
in that he moderated her violent Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports,
which would become ſometimes
ſo exceſſive, that no Body durſt come

which is of moſt concern is, that this
Impoſtor ſhould give her a Confeſſor to

made her diſmiſs a Reverend Capuchin

theſe Tranſports, and upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſerv'd this Princeſs afterward with

was always a Coldneſs between the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
and <hi>Azzolini,</hi> and yet they ſaw
one another in Chappels, Conſiſtories,
Congregations, and other Functions of
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> where they could
not avoid ſpeaking without Scandal, but
they were very reſerv'd, and had no
Confidence one in another. The Queen
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54799:145"/>
would have had them have gone to it
briskly, but they were too wiſe to make
a Noiſe, which made the Queen ſay
aloud one day, when ſhe ſaw <hi>Azzolini</hi>

            <p>It is time to finiſh this Hiſtory by the
Death of Queen <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> but it is ſo
interwoven with the Adventures of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orgina,</hi>
or <hi>Signora Angelica,</hi> that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deſcribe the one without making
mention of the other. For though this
Charming Virgin was the innocent cauſe
of her Death, it had been better ſhe
had never entred into the Queen's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
for this Princeſs perhaps might
have been yet Alive, had ſhe not died
of ſpite that ſhe could not revenge her
ſelf of an Outrage done in her Family,
to <hi>Signora Angelica.</hi> It muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
that Beauty is a dangerous thing
in a young Virgin, but above all when
ſhe has other Talents, which inflame no
leſs, ſeeing the Palace of a great Queen
was not able to protect her from the
Ambuſhes laid for this fair Singer, by
which ſhe became a Prey to a Wretch,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:54799:145"/>
after ſhe had triumph'd over the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
of the greateſt Lords in <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Angelica</hi> was a Virgin, incomparable
both for Beauty and Wit; her Stature
was ſomething above the ordinary ſize,
well taken and ſlender; her Viſage a
perfect Oval, her Eyes Sparkling, her
Hair of a bright Flaxen colour, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to White, an Aquiline Noſe,
white Teeth, vermilion Lips, and her
Neck excellently Shap'd; Her Wit was
full and exact, her Conception eaſie, of
a complaiſant Humour, and ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
in her whole Perſon as made
her Beloved by great and ſmall, for it
may be ſaid, that from the Scepter to
the Spade, all Eſtates and Conditions of
Men have done Homage to her Merit.
In fine to make a juſt Portraiture of her,
one muſt take a Muſe for a Model, for
to all her Perfections, ſhe would ſing ſo
rarely, that it would Raviſh all that
heard her, and touch'd Inſtruments to
a Miracle. Her putative Father was

and becauſe he was call'd <hi>Georgino,</hi> ſhe
acquir'd the Name of <hi>Georgina.</hi> Her

Tongues, who are never idle, would let
themſelves looſe againſt this excellent
Virgin, as if ſhe had a fault in her Birth,
and that the Religious would have her,
becauſe Eccleſiaſticks have there ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a Commerce of Gallantry, as if
they were not like other Men. Love
is the moſt Violent of all the Paſſions,
and there are none but are ſenſible of its
Effects. A peaceable and ſedentary Life,
is more ſuſceptible of it than any other,
and to ſum up the Account, a Man with
a long Gown, both in <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>
though he be oblig'd to live in Gaelibate,
does not looſe his Reputation among
Men, becauſe he has had an Amorous
Intrigue. I know, that before God it
is a Sin without Excuſe: But however
it be, when the Fact is done, the Laws
oblige Prieſts who have Children, to
breed them up well, and to furniſh Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
for their Subſiſtence and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

any Father took greater care in the

ſo well did he love her, and with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
for as much a Child as ſhe was,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:54799:146"/>
ſhe had ſo many Agreements, that ſhe
Charmed the moſt Inſenſible. As ſhe
had Naturally a moſt admirable Voice,
and an inclination to Muſick, he gave
her the beſt Maſters in <hi>Rome,</hi> to teach
her to Sing, and touch all ſorts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
which ſhe learn'd ſo eaſily,
that ſhe ſurpaſſed all her Maſters with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking pains; and to this day ſhe
has not any equal at the <hi>Lute, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orboe,
Harpſicord,</hi> or <hi>Virginals.</hi> She
had beſides the fineſt Voice in <hi>Italy.</hi> For
though there be excellent Muſicians at
<hi>Rome,</hi> who are moſt of them Caſtrated
to preſerve their Voices, there was found
in hers a certain Harmony with ſuch
force and ſweetneſs, as there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like it. Theſe rare Qualities made
her ſought after by the greateſt Princes
in <hi>Europe,</hi> and it was Force only that
withheld her from going to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's
Court, or that of <hi>France,</hi> where
ſhe was much deſired. But thoſe who
gave Life to her, could never reſolve
to looſe her out of Sight, through the
Affection they bore her, judging beſides
that ſhe would not fail to make her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
in her own Country by her Merit,
without expoſing her to the danger of
Travel. <hi>Signora Caterina,</hi> her Mother,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:54799:147"/>
who had other Children to provide for,
was very fond of <hi>Angelica</hi>'s Merit, who
had a great mind to Travel, and above
all, into <hi>France,</hi> Becauſe the Modes and
Gallantries of that Court, run ſtrongly
in her Mind; but not being Miſtreſs of
her own Will, ſhe had no other part to
take, but that of Obedience. Her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and her Talents encreas'd with her
Age, and at the ſame time, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of her Admirers augmented every
day. The firſt who enterpriz'd the
Conqueſt of her Heart, were young Men
of a ſuitable Condition to her own. For
ſhe always paſs'd for the Daughter of a
little Commiſſioner of the <hi>Mount of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
of a very indifferent Fortune, but
yet one who was a civil Perſon, and
maintain'd his Family Honeſtly npon the
Revenue of his Employ, and ſome Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances
which <hi>Monſeignieur Zachary</hi>
furniſh'd them with Privately upon the
account of <hi>Angelica. Georgino</hi> had not
Married the Mother of <hi>Angelica,</hi> but
in view of a better Dowry than ſhe
would have had without her Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
with the Prelate, and in hope of
being aſſiſted for their Care in the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his Daughter. And that as he
was none of thoſe Commodious Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:54799:147"/>
which ſuffer their Wives to live
in Diſorder, provided it bring Water
to the Mill; ſo on the other hand, he was
not ſo ſcrupulous about the Gallantries
his Wife had done before Marriage. He
liv'd very Privately, according to the
Cuſtom and Genius of the <hi>Italians,</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
almoſt no Company, and therefore
liv'd in a Quarter that was diſtant from
Noiſe, and Great People, in which alſo
good Husbandry might have a ſhare, as
well as the love of Eaſe. For in the
Quarter of <hi>Traſtevera,</hi> Houſes are very
Cheap, though Spacious enough, and
he had there the convenience of a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and a Garden, being near the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery
of St. <hi>Cecilia,</hi> over againſt the
Working-Shop of the <hi>French Accademy.</hi>
Every body knows, that the <hi>French</hi>
King maintains an Academy in <hi>Rome,</hi>
for Twelve <hi>French</hi> Youths, who there
learn fine Arts, with intention to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
capable of the better Service of
their Country, when they come home.
This <hi>Academy</hi> is compos'd of ſix Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
four Gravers, and two Architects,
whoſe Buſineſs it is to Copy and imitate
the fineſt Paintings and Sculptures in
<hi>Rome,</hi> and to Meaſure the fineſt Palaces
and other Edifices, both Ancient and
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:54799:148"/>
Modern. Monſieur <hi>Errard,</hi> Director of
the Accademy, liv'd with his Pupils, in
the old Palace, near St. <hi>Andre de la Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le;</hi>
but becauſe he had not room enough
for Marble and other Materials for
Sculpture; he had a Working-Shop,
as I ſaid before in <hi>Traſtevera,</hi> near St.
<hi>Cecilia,</hi> where the Gravers of the Acca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy
Wrought, and Din'd every day
for their greater Convenience. A young
<hi>French</hi> Graver called <hi>Theodon,</hi> who was
already very skilful in his Art, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
a well Shap'd Perſon, having upon
occaſion ſeen <hi>Angelica</hi> at a Window, and
and as ſhe went to Church, became
Charm'd with her Merit, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to make her underſtand it by
Signs. His Perſeverance touch'd her at
laſt, and ſhe permitted him to ſee her
ſometimes, which pleas'd him extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
but he was ſo often croſs'd by other
Pretenders, that it gave him mortal
Alarms, fearing one or other of
them would raviſh away his Miſtreſs's
Heart. The Fame of <hi>Angelica</hi> encreas'd
daily, as well as her Voice and Beauty.
Her Mother often brought her among
the Religious and Ladies of the firſt
Quality, where ſhe Charm'd them all
by her Singing, and her addreſs in tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:54799:148"/>
of Inſtruments. This encreas'd the
multitude of her Lovers, among which
were many Perſons of high Birth; this
oblig'd her Mother to keep her ſhut
up cloſer than uſual, and to watch her
Conduct more narrowly. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
did nothing but augment the
crowd of her Adorers, and their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was more frequented than ever, to
have the pleaſure of ſeeing her at her
Window, which ſhe kept open more
than ordinary, to croſs the Jealouſie of
her Mother, and above all, in Carnival
time, where the fineſt Maſquerades would
forſake their Courſe to come and walk
up and down about her Houſe. Her
Mother being Cunning and Intriguing,
made a great advantage of the Preſents
made her, in giving ſome hopes to all
People, without engaging her ſelf too
much, and obtain'd what Favours ſhe
pleas'd from the Great ones, who Sigh'd
and Languiſh'd for her Daughter. Prince
<hi>Columbiere</hi> propos'd to Marry her to one
of his Gentlemen, to get her into his
Houſe. But her Mother diſcovering the
Intrigue, would hear of it by no means,
and beſides, expected a more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Match for her Daughter <hi>Angelica,</hi>
whoſe proper Merit, was her Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:54799:149"/>
deſir'd to match with one of an
equal Condition with her ſelf, out of
fear that if ſhe Married above her ſelf,
her Husband ſhould come to Deſpiſe her,
if a fit of Sickneſs, or any other Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
ſhould cauſe her to looſe her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or her Voice. Among all that ſought
after her, none pleas'd her ſo well as
<hi>Theodon</hi> the Graver. He was a well
ſhap'd Perſon, and they had a Sympany
in their Humours. He excell'd in his Art,
and did the Office of Director of the
Accademy, inſtead of Monſieur <hi>Errard,</hi>
whoſe decrepid Age, had made him unfit
for Buſineſs. <hi>Catherine,</hi> who was more
ambitious than her Daughter, would
hear nothing of it; and in the mean
time making advantage of the Gifts,
which the greateſt Lords in <hi>Rome</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
her, to obtain the promiſe of
hearing <hi>Angelica</hi> Sing, though they did
not end their Pretenſions there. But
ſhe not ſeeming to penetrate their
Thoughts, and agreeing to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
was contented to keep her
Daughter in her Sight, fearing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
there might happen ſome Accident
which might looſe her Reputation and
ruine her Fortune. <hi>Angelica,</hi> who did
not like this Management, and could not
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:54799:149"/>
find poor <hi>Theodon</hi> in all the Crowd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
ſo Melancholy that ſhe fell Sick, and
was in danger of Death. Her Parents
were much Alarmed, and the Prelate
told her Mother, that if ſhe did not
drive away this Multitude that Beſieg'd
his Daughter, he would take her out of
her Hands, and put her into a Convent.
As he was a ſevere Man and had Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
they muſt obey him, and ſo they
ſent her into the Country, where the
Air quickly re-eſtabliſh'd her Health.</p>
            <p>Being return'd to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
ſhe was inviſible to all the
World, except <hi>Theodon,</hi> who ſaw her
at a Window, and ſpoke to her by
Signs: <hi>Signora Caterina</hi> ſent <hi>Angelica</hi> to
the firſt Maſs upon Sundays and Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,
and made her keep within all the
reſt of the Day.</p>
            <p>But this conſtraint being very uneaſie
to <hi>Theodon,</hi> he ſpoke to a Friend of his
who was the Father of Inventions, and
he promis'd him to find out ſome way
or other, to have a ſight of his Beloved.
He ſearch'd round about the Houſe, and
ſound a ſmall Houſe juſt by it, which
had a Court yard well ſtor'd with Fowls;
he got acquainted with the good Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that kept them, and under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:54799:150"/>
of buying of Eggs, and a Preſent,
obtain'd Permiſſion to come into the
Court-yard every Night with his Friend
<hi>Theodon,</hi> becauſe a back Window of
<hi>Angelica</hi>'s Chamber look'd into it.</p>
            <p>They advertis'd the Fair one of this
Diſcovery, and ſhe promis'd at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Signal to appear at that Window;
but ſhe was ſo high they could not hear
her, unleſs ſhe ſpoke aloud, which ſhe
durſt not do, for fear of a Diſcovery:
Then they tied <hi>Billets deux</hi> to the end
of a Packthread, and ſhe drew them up,
and ſome time after ſent back an Anſwer
the ſame way. Her Billets were ſo
Spiritual and Tender, that one might
ſee, that her Heart and Love dictated
them; but beſides theſe, ſhe had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in ſtore for the happy <hi>Theodon,</hi>
that was more Charming.</p>
            <p>Whereas in <hi>Rome</hi> other Lovers Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renade
their Miſtreſſes at their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
in the Night, and endeavour to
expreſs their Torments in tender and
paſſionate Airs; here on the contrary,
this Charming Virgin would Sing to her
Harpſical, pieces of an Opera, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
ſo well to the Subject of Love,
that one would think they were made
on purpoſe. You may believe that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:54799:150"/>
and his Friend did not fail to be at
the Rendezvouſe, where they always
found new Pleaſures, and they carried
alſo little Collations, and ſerved her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
with the beſt things, which they
put into a little Basket, and the Lovely
Priſoner drew it to her ſelf, and ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated
of the Feaſt, telling them that
ſhe eat theſe Fruits and other Trifles
with more appetite than a Hawker, or
thoſe Solider Viands her Mother was ſo
often Regal'd with; for ſhe could not
hinder her ſelf from receiving part of
that which the moſt illuſtrious of her
Purſuers, would privately bring into
their Houſe.</p>
            <p>There was two among the reſt who
were very conſiderable, both in their
Quality being Princes, and by their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality.
<hi>Catherine</hi> manag'd them both,
and aſſigned them different Hours, for
fear they ſhould meet one another; but
but this Precaution was all to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
for their Griſons diſcover'd them,
and they were much amaz'd to meet one
another in the ſame Chace, for they
were both Comrades, and Allies.</p>
            <p>Things being ſo, they were forc'd to
accommodate themſelves to the Seaſon,
and each endeavour'd to prefer himſelf
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:54799:151"/>
to his Miſtreſſes Favour, living as yet in
a good Underſtanding with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but the Coldneſs and Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of <hi>Angelica</hi> towards them, made
each of them believe his Comrade hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
to his prejudice. They fell out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Imagination, and would have
made a noiſe, if they had not been hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
For one who was call'd the Abbot
of St. <hi>Marc,</hi> was Violent, Imperious,
and of an high Hand; but the other,
who is at preſent Lord <hi>de la Mouche Eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>three,</hi>
was more Tractable. <hi>Angelica</hi>
hated them equally, and being a Perſon
no way ſuitable to either of them, ſigh'd
only for her dear <hi>Theodon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The frequent Importunities of theſe
two great Lords, forc'd <hi>Angelica</hi> to
have recourſe to her Father, (for ſo
they call'd Monſeigneur <hi>Zachary</hi>) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerating
the Tyrannies of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This Prelate to encourage his
Daughter, to enter into a Convent, gave
her a Dowry of eight thouſand Crowns,
which were put into the Bank of the
Mount of Piety in a borrowed Name.
<hi>Angelica</hi> not being able to do any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
diſpos'd her ſelf to enter into a
Nunnery, comforting her ſelf with this,
That ſhe ſhould however be near her
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:54799:151"/>
Lover, and that ſhe might ſee him in his
Working-Shop, by the Balliſtrades of
the Clock, which at the ſame time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes
her Innocence.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were a doing, the
Prelate dies, leaving this fine and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Daughter to the Diſcretion of her
Mother, who diſſuaded her from going
into a Convent for the Intereſts of her
Family, and the poor Daughter was
forc'd to accommodate her ſelf to her
Humour; ſhe muſt then take up again
the Trade of Singing as before.</p>
            <p>A Cardinal of the firſt Rank in the
Sacred Colledge, and perhaps one of
the handſomeſt, who had ſometime be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made an Ambaſſadreſs of <hi>France,</hi> in
Love with him, hearing ſo many fine
Things ſpoken of <hi>Angelica,</hi> would ſee
whether they were true: His Authority
and Liberality found every where a free
Acceſs; and he was Charm'd with the
Voice and Manners of <hi>Angelica,</hi> but he
went ſo often, that the noiſe came as
far as the Ears of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. As
he was a very ſevere and angry Pope,
and would let no Body be at quiet, he
took a reſolution to cauſe <hi>Angelica</hi> to be
taken up and put into a Convent, as
Scandalous, and of ill Reputation. So
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:54799:152"/>
true is it, that in his Time, the Innocent
ſuffer'd as well as the Guilty; for her
Mother was more to blame than ſhe,
ſeeing ſhe receiv'd no viſit but out of
Obedience.</p>
            <p>At that time, the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>
was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and they boaſted to him
of <hi>Angelica,</hi> as one of the Singularities,
or fineſt thing that was to be ſeen in
<hi>Rome.</hi> The Marquiſs <hi>Del Monte</hi> brought
her to his Highneſs, as we have ſaid
before; and he found her ſo well to
anſwer her Character, that he made her
very conſiderable Offers to come to his
Court. The great Liberalities he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd
upon her Mother, engag'd her to
promiſe a conſent to his Will; but <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi>
who ſaw no Security for her ſelf,
when ſhe was in the hands of ſo puiſſant
a Prince, was not able to reſolve what
to do. She had notice given her quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after, to have a care of her ſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Pope was going to take her
up and put her in a Convent, and this
put her into a terrible Fright; for tho'
ſhe had no repugnance to enter into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
ſhe could not ſuffer her ſelf to
be confin'd in a Monaſtery, ordain'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for Women of ill Reputation. There
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:54799:152"/>
was then no remedy, but in all the haſte
imaginable, to implore the Protection
of Queen <hi>Chriſtina.</hi> She did it, and this
Generous Princeſs, who had a great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
for her, becauſe ſhe had heard her Sing
often, not only permitted her a Refuge
in her Quarter, but took her into her
Service, with a Siſter of hers named
<hi>Barbara,</hi> who was alſo a moſt Beautiful
Virgin, but had not ſo great a faculty
of Singing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theodon</hi> was over joy'd that his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
had eſcap'd ſo many and powerful
Rivals, and it gave him courage to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
his Purſuit. To this end, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs'd
himſelf to one of the Queen's
<hi>Valet de Chambres,</hi> who was his Friend, to
get a ſight of her, and eaſily obtain'd his
Requeſt. But as Lovers are never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
<hi>Theodon</hi> importun'd him ſo
much, that he promis'd him, that he
ſhould come to the Speech of her.</p>
            <p>One day the Queen kept an Academy
of Muſick in her Garden, and there was
a great many Ladies, Knights and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
under the ſhady Grove, where
was a fine breeze of Air: <hi>Angelica,</hi> when
ſhe had ſung her Roll, ſlipt down an
Alley with her Siſter, and entred into a
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:54799:153"/>
little Banquetting-Houſe, where <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
had made a magnificent Collation to
preſent her with in his Friend's Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
of the beſt Wines that were to be
had. It was about the time that the Song
of <hi>Flon, Flon,</hi> was in requeſt; and the
Trumpets of the Marquiſs <hi>de Lavardin,</hi>
being poſted upon a little Hill in the
ſame Garden, ſounded the ſame Tune.
The Eccho's repeated the laſt Words;
All the World Sung it, and the Qeeen
her ſelf ſung <hi>Flon, Flon.</hi> The Joy was
univerſal, and the Wine made our Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
become Poets; For after they had
drank plentifully, they propos'd to make
every one a Couplet to this new Air,
and <hi>Angelica</hi> taking her <hi>Guitarre,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
and did it very well for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempory
Effort, and was follow'd by
<hi>Theodon</hi>'s Friend. A thouſand ſits of
Laughter accompanied the Muſick, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch,
that others of the Queen's
Maids walking in the Garden, were
drawn thither by the Noiſe. They
preſented them Fruits, and they ſat
down on <hi>Angelica</hi>'s ſide, and drank their
Healths over and over, and the Sport
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſted till almoſt Night, when a Footman
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:54799:153"/>
came to give her notice, that ſhe muſt
wait upon the Queen, the Company be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
now gone. She broke off therefore
this ſweet Converſation, but with Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to her ſelf, and promis'd to ſee
him again as often as ſhe could.</p>
            <p>But this happy Seaſon did not laſt
long; for a little after the Queen fell
Sick, and ſo all ſorts of Divertiſements
ended. This Sickneſs was fatal to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi>
for her own Mother deliver'd
her up to be Diſhonour'd by an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
wretch in the Queen's Palace. It
was to the Abbot <hi>Vannini,</hi> (whom I have
mention'd before) the ſame that abus'd
<hi>Signora Giovannini,</hi> and was the cauſe
of her Death. This Prelate, who was
ambitious to make himſelf Talk'd of,
had gain'd <hi>Signora Caterina,</hi> with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of Silver, of above the value of a
thouſand Crowns; <hi>Angelica</hi> having
all ſorts of Liberty of going out with
her Mother; was carried to walk a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Women, where ſhe always met
the Abbot <hi>Vannini,</hi> who perpetually
courted her, but to no purpoſe; For ſhe
was extreamly angry, that her own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhould ſo often expoſe her to the
Outrages of this raſh Man, inſomuch,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:54799:154"/>
that ſhe proteſted, ſhe would no more
go out of her Majeſty's Palace, whoſe
Sickneſs encreas'd daily, and at the ſame
time, the Fears of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Abbot, notwithſtanding all the
Diſdain of <hi>Angelica,</hi> was neither aſham'd,
nor dejected, but thought to obtain
that by Preſents and Importunity which
he could not by Perſonal Merit; but he
advanc'd nothing at all that way; for
all his Preſents were rejected, and his
Sighs deſpis'd.</p>
            <p>At laſt being provok'd by ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
as he expected not to find, he
undertook one of the raſheſt and moſt
dangerous Actions that could fall into
the Imagination, of ſo contemptible a
Perſon as himſelf, which was to do Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
to the Honour of <hi>Angelica,</hi> even
in the Palace of the Queen her ſelf. To
this end and purpoſe he gain'd a <hi>Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan,</hi>
who was one of the Queens <hi>Valet
de Chambres,</hi> with his Brother an Anſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade,
and they brought him privately
into <hi>Angelica</hi>'s Chamber, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of her Mother. <hi>Angelica</hi> was then
with the Queen, ſcarcely ever forſaking
her, becauſe her Sickneſs was very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
But coming into her Chamber
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:54799:154"/>
by chance to do ſomething, ſhe was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
ſurpriz'd to find a great Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the Abbot <hi>Vannini,</hi> who invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her to eat, with her Mother, and
thoſe honeſt People, that were of the
Plot. But ſhe, ſeeing her ſelf Betray'd
by her Mother, was perfectly Aſtoniſh'd,
and ſet up a great Cry. The Abbot
threw himſelf upon his Knees, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to aſſure her, by good Words,
but in the mean time they all ſlipt out
of the Chamber, and left them alone, and
one may eaſily imagin that the Abbot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Maſter, did not looſe time. The
Chamber was ſo high that <hi>Angelica</hi>'s Cries
could not be hear'd; but there was other
Signs of the reſiſtance of this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
young Woman, for the Table and
Chairs were all overturn'd, and at laſt
ſo great a noiſe was made, her (Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
being juſt over the Queen's) that
her Majeſty complain'd they had loſt
their Reſpect.</p>
            <p>One of the Gentlemen run up and ſaw
this fine Farce, and cry'd out for help
to ſome <hi>Auſpeſſades</hi> and Foot men, who
were upon the Guard. Her Friend <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odon</hi>
ran up at the Noiſe, and ſhe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
him, begg'd that he would have
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:54799:155"/>
Compaſſion of her; He preſently took
him by the Throat, and would have
Strangl'd him, if he had not been forced
out of his hands. They then ſent to ſeek
out Monſieur <hi>Pompey Azzolini,</hi> the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's
Nephew, to know what they muſt
do with this impudent Perſon. His
firſt thought was, that he ſhould be
hewed in Pieces; and in ſo doing, he
had followed the Queen's Genius, and
highly reveng'd the Injury done to
her Majeſty. But conſidering that the
Queen was Sick and the Abbot well Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied,
he thought it convenient, (for
fear of making himſelf Enemies) to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
him to Eſcape. He ſav'd himſelf at
the Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtes,</hi> and the two <hi>Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans</hi>
Fled, and were never heard of
ſince.</p>
            <p>They told the Queen, that the noiſe
came from Cats, who had overturn'd
the Utenſils of the Chamber, and caus'd
this Alarm.</p>
            <p>Poor <hi>Angelica,</hi> after ſo bloody an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
abandon'd her ſelf to Deſpair,
and was a long time in a Swoon, and
amaz'd, not knowing what to do. Her
Siſter coming up at the Noiſe, put her
to bed, for the Traytreſs her Mother.
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:54799:155"/>
was as inviſible as the reſt, and <hi>Angelica</hi>
was ſeiz'd with a Fever, and ſick of Grief
for a long time?</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Queen began to
be better, and all People rejoyc'd for
her Recovery. For ſhe was well Belov'd
in <hi>Rome,</hi> becauſe ſhe gave much in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
towards the Subſiſtance of the
Poor, and Maintain'd a great many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
The Nation of the <hi>Marca d'
Ancona,</hi> made a fine Feaſt at the Church
of St. <hi>Saviour du Lau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ier,</hi> in honour of
the Queen, and fine Illuminations in the
Street of <hi>Coronari,</hi> which is near it,
with Bonfires and other Rejoicings of
Drums and Trumpets.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Alibert</hi> alſo made a very Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
Feaſt at <hi>Jeſus,</hi> where a Votive
Maſs of the Bleſſed Virgin, was Sung in
a Thanksgiving for the Queen's Health,
and he had the moſt excellent Muſicians
in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Church was hang'd with
the richeſt Tapiſtry her Majeſty had, and
all People crowded into teſtifies their joy.
But at laſt ſhe perceiv'd that <hi>Angelica</hi>
fail'd in her Duty, and asked for her
very often, but they always told her
ſhe was Sick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:54799:156"/>
Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> had forbidden any
body to ſpeak of this Scandal which had
happened in the Queen's Palace. But a
certain Woman who help'd <hi>Bandiere</hi> in
his Operations of Chymiſtry, whom
they call'd <hi>Sybil,</hi> for the reaſons we ſhall
afterwards mention, told the Queen ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Accident, or out of Malice, that
<hi>Angelica</hi> was Well. The Queen ſent
preſently to call her in all haſte, and the
poor Girl being frighted, becauſe ſhe was
forc'd to appear before her, whom ſhe
believ'd to be inform'd of all the Affair,
caſt her ſelf at her Feet, pouring out
abundance of Tears, and could not ſpeak
for Grief. The Queen preſs'd her to
tell the reaſon of her Tears, and ſhe
anſwer'd, that her Misfortune was but
too publick. Her Majeſty order'd her
to Explain her ſelf; but Sobs interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
her every Moment; and therefore
the Queen deſir'd Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> who
was then come to her, to inform her of
all the Affair <hi>Azzolini</hi> being troubled
at the unſeaſonableneſs of the time, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated
the Matter, and told her only
what he thought convenient to diſcover,
for fear ſhe ſhould fall into an exceſſive
Paſſion, which might make her relapſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:54799:156"/>
But this did not ſatisfie her, for ſhe ſaw
well enough, that he hid the greateſt
part of the Circumſtances from her, and
therefore could not be quiet till ſhe had
learn'd the whole Story from her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks,
by Queſtions and Threatning.
What he had foreſeen, fell out, for the
Queen preſently fell into an horrible
Paſſion againſt this infamous Abbot, and
againſt all thoſe that ſuffer'd him to
Eſcape. After ſhe had comforted <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi>
about the Diſgrace ſhe was no way
guilty of, ſent for Captain <hi>Merula</hi> her
Bravo, and commanded him to bring
her the Head of the Abbot <hi>Vannini,</hi> and
to obſerve him ſo narrowly, that he
did not Eſcape; and becauſe ſhe would
be ſure of her Blow, ſhe order'd what
Men and Money he had need of, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
him a good Reward and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
againſt all his Enemies.</p>
            <p>It is not known whether this Aſſaſſin
by Profeſſion, did himſelf diſcover her
Orders, or that it came to be known
ſome other way; But <hi>Vannini</hi> fled from
<hi>Rome,</hi> to <hi>Subjacco</hi> an Abbey of Cardinal
<hi>Charles Barberini</hi> in one of his Eminence's
Coaches, but abſconded often by the
way, and at laſt when he came there,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:54799:157"/>
look'd more like Dead, than Alive, ſo
true it is, that Vice is its own Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner.
He paſs'd from thence into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruzzo,</hi>
a Province of the Realm of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi>
where he remain'd till the Queen's
Death. In the mean time, <hi>Merula</hi> ſought
him every where, or pretended ſo to do;
for 'tis believ'd, that the two Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
who were the Abbot's Protectors,
preſented him with a thouſand Crowns,
to hold his Hand. Beſides that, he might
fear their reſentment if the Queen ſhould
Die quickly, of which there was great
likelyhood. The Queen being impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
often demanded from <hi>Merula</hi> the
effects of his Promiſes. But one day he
own'd, without thinking on't, that the
Criminal had ſcap'd out of his Hands,
and had refug'd himſelf within the
Realm of <hi>Naples.</hi> At theſe words, the
Queen was in ſuch a Rage, that ſhe
Scratch'd him in the Face, and gave him
twenty blows with her Fiſt, reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him with Perfidiouſneſs, and had
certainly Strangled him, if ſhe had not
wanted Strength. But ſhe kill'd her
ſelf in the Effort which ſhe made; for
this Agitation brought her Feaver on
her again, and ſent her into her Grave
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:54799:157"/>
in a little time, to the great damage of
the Domeſticks, for whom ſhe had no
time to provide.</p>
            <p>No body got more by her Death than
<hi>Angelica;</hi> For if the Queen had liv'd a
a little longer, ſhe had been confin'd in
a Convent all her Life, as Scandalous,
though ſhe had more misfortune, than
fault in her Conduct. For the Queen
had promis'd the Pope (who was irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by the frequent Stories brought
him concerning her) that ſhe would put
her among the Religious of St. <hi>Ruffinus</hi>
in <hi>Traſtevera.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The beſt way <hi>Angelica</hi> could take in
this unhappy Conjuncture, was to put
her ſelf under the Protection of the
Duke of <hi>Medina Celi,</hi> Ambaſſador of
<hi>Spain;</hi> And he came to take her at the
Queen's Palace Gate, juſt as ſhe was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring,
before they had forc'd her into
a Convent. He plac'd her under the
Dutcheſs his Lady, where ſhe lives yet
at this preſent time, in Quality of her
firſt Lady of Honour, being equally
dear both to the Husband and the Wife,
who know very well, by long Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that ſhe has given no occaſion
for thoſe falſe Reports, which have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:54799:158"/>
tarniſh'd her Reputation; and that
her Merit only has been the cauſe of all
her Perſecutions. There run a Report,
that Monſieur the Ambaſſador, had Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
her to a Spaniſh Gentleman in his
Service; but it is not true, for ſhe is
not yet engag'd in that Sacrament, no
more than her Siſter <hi>Barbara,</hi> who is
alſo Maid of Honour to Madam the
Ambaſſadreſs of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sieur <hi>Theodon</hi> being convinc'd,
that <hi>Angelica</hi> was not ordain'd for him,
has Married another, who has neither
the Gifts nor Reputation of <hi>Angelica,</hi>
yet notwithſtanding is not inferior to
her in Wiſdom. She brought him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Portion, and he lives with her
like an honeſt Man, and has obtain'd by
Merit, to be Director of the Works of
Architecture, and Painting of the Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
of St. <hi>Peter</hi> at the <hi>Vatican,</hi> which
is very Gainful.</p>
            <p>We muſt not forget, before we finiſh
this Hiſtory, that the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>
made another Voyage to <hi>Rome incognito,</hi>
towards the end of the Queen's laſt
Sickneſs, (and as the common Vogue
goes) to carry away <hi>Angelica,</hi> with her
Mother's Conſent; but being prevented
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:54799:158"/>
by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador, he was ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
that he had been twice cheated by
that Intereſted Woman, that he ſlit
both her Husband's, and afterwards her
Son's Noſe, who is a Glaſier, and keeps
a Shop in the <hi>Bouchi.</hi> They are ſo dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured,
that they will carry the Marks,
as long as they live; which will teſtifie to
all the World, that <hi>Georgina</hi> having
Perfections enough to Charm many
Princes, and great Lords, had not yet
the happineſs to pleaſe them all.</p>
            <p>The Queen had ſome Pre-ſentiments
of her Death, which made her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive,
ſhe ſhould not live long. Six
Months before her Sickneſs, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about,
ſhe made her a Habit of Sattin,
white Ground, ſtitch'd with Flowers,
and other works of Gold, garniſh'd
with Lace, and Buttons ſet in Gold, and
Fringe of the ſame below. This Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
was Invented by her ſelf, and ſerv'd
for a <hi>Manteau</hi> and Body together. It was
cloſe before, without a Tail, and round
at the bottom, and the Queen tried it
on upon <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Eve, and took many
turns in her Cloſet, without ſpeaking a
Word: She look'd upon her ſelf often,
both before and behind, in a couple of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:54799:159"/>
Looking-glaſſes, which were ſet oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
one to another, and then walked
again, in profound Silence. Her Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
who thought he had done better
than ordinary, rejoic'd within himſelf;
And there was none but him, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſs
<hi>Caponi,</hi> and two Maids there, when
<hi>Sybil</hi> entred. This <hi>Sybil</hi> was a Woman
well skill'd in Chymical Operations,
and had ſerved the Queen for ſome time.
Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> brought her in to
counter-check <hi>Bandiere.</hi> Her Name was
<hi>Julia,</hi> and ſhe was Daughter to an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary,
a good Simpler, who taught
her his Trade, which ſhe improv'd, by
the Invention of a certain number of fine
Secrets. She had ſomething Marvelous
in her Perſon, and her Birth was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.
For when her Mother Lay
in of her, which was upon the <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi>
1665, ſhe was ſeven Hours in
Travel, with great Pains, and was not
Deliver'd, but by an horrible Clap of
Thunder: The Lightning that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
it, made her Chamber ſeem all
on Fire; and the Fright made ſuch an
Impreſſion upon her, that it threw out
the Child.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:54799:159"/>
Her Sex was doubtful at firſt, and
though time made it appear ſhe was a
Girl, yet ſhe always had the inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Men, flying Girls Company, and
ſeeking after Boys; She would throw
Stones as they did, and fight with her
Fiſts, and ſhewed a Maſculine Spirit in
all things. She learn'd Latin, and made a
a great Progreſs not only in Pharmacy,
but Chymiſtry; beſides this, ſhe touch'd
Inſtruments well. But ſhe had yet a
Quality beyond theſe, which pleas'd
the Queen better than all, which was
that of the foretelling of things to come,
and for this reaſon, the Queen gave her
the name of <hi>Sybil.</hi> I have been inform'd,
ſhe had once an Husband a Diſtiller,
but he died after he had been Married a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſix Months.</p>
            <p>The Queen, who was fooliſh in the
belief of all vain and curious Sciences,
as <hi>Chymiſtry, Aſtrology,</hi> the <hi>Divining-Rod,</hi>
and loved thoſe who pretended to
poſſeſs them believ'd all that Aſtrologers
ſaid, and particularly the Abbot <hi>Maſſoni,</hi>
who us'd to flatter her with the promiſe
of living Fourſcore Years, and by theſe
deceitful hopes, he drew a good deal of
Money from this credulous Princeſs, and
afterwards Laugh'd at her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="304" facs="tcp:54799:160"/>
I could tell you a great many Stories
of this nature, if this Book were not
too big already.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sybil</hi> coming to congratulate the
Queen upon her fine Garment, exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
the fineneſs of the Stuff, its Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Faſhion, which very well ſuited
her Majeſty's Perſon.</p>
            <p>Well, <hi>Sybil,</hi> (ſays the Queen) does
this Habit pleaſe you?</p>
            <p>Yes, Madam, (repled ſhe) it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
well made.</p>
            <p>Upon this, the Marquiſs <hi>Caponi</hi> took
up the Diſcourſe, and ſaid, you are
come very luckily, for we are here act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Comedy of the Mutes.</p>
            <p>It is true, ſays the Queen, that no
body has ſaid any thing, nor I my ſelf,
but this Habit which you ſee, makes
me think of ſome things of great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
and I believe it will ſerve me
in a little time, in one of the greateſt
Functions that can be; but <hi>Sybil,</hi> thou art
not able to Divine what Function this
ſhould be.</p>
            <p>Pardon me, Madam, (anſwer'd ſhe)
looking attentively on the Queen, your
Majeſty thinks this Habit will ſerve;
Shall I ſpeak it, Madam?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:54799:160"/>
Yes, ſaith the Queen.</p>
            <p>The thought afflicts me, ſaith <hi>Sybil,</hi>
Your Majeſty thinks, you ſhall be Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
in this Habit in a little time.</p>
            <p>And I, ſaith the Marquiſs, interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
haſtily, believe the Queen thinks
it will ſerve her to wiſh the Pope an
happy New Year in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sybil</hi> has ſpoke the Truth, replied
the Queen, that was it I thought on,
but we muſt put all into the Hand of
God, for we are all Mortal, and I as
well as another.</p>
            <p>The Taylor, to divert this ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Diſcourſe, addreſſing himſelf to the
Queen, ſaid,</p>
            <p>Will your Majeſty have a Cover made
for this Habit?</p>
            <p>Why a Cover, great Beaſt, ſays the
Queen?</p>
            <p>To keep it twenty Years, and above,
ſaith the Taylor; For if it be deſign'd
for the uſe your Majeſty ſpeaks, you
muſt take care the Worms do not eat
it.</p>
            <p>She fell a Laughing, and was well
pleas'd with the Repartee. After ſome
Diſcourſe of this nature, they ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the Marquiſs grumbled at <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bil,</hi>
for her ill Augury.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:54799:161"/>
You miſtake, quoth <hi>Sybil,</hi> I have not
foretold the Queen's Death, I only found
out her Thought.</p>
            <p>This odd Apprehenſion did ſo poſſeſs
the Queen's Mind, that the Taylor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulating
her upon the recovery of
her Health, as others did, ſaid,</p>
            <p>Madam, the Habit is the Cover, and
may, if it pleaſe God, be ſo a long
time.</p>
            <p>God grant it, ſays the Queen, but I
am of Opinion it will ſerve me ere long
for the uſe I believe 'tis deſign'd.</p>
            <p>This thought made too ſtrong an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
upon her Spirits, to believe the
<hi>Sybil</hi> Divin'd it meerly by chance.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange, ſays the Marquiſs <hi>Capo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi>
your Majeſty ſhould think ſo much
upon the words of a Fool; And will
your Majeſty be always abus'd?</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> coming in, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd
him to aſſiſt, to take off the ill Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
the Queen had receiv'd; which
he endeavouring to do, the Queen ſeem'd
to believe, only for this reaſon, that he
might no farther trouble her Head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal meeting the <hi>Sybil</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
gave her a ſmart Reprimand, for
entertaining the Queen with Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:54799:161"/>
Viſions. But ſhe excus'd her ſelf,
That ſhe had done nothing with an ill
intent; That ſhe wiſh'd not the Queen's
Death, for her own ſake; for, ſaid ſhe,
there will no body looſe more than my
ſelf, for I foreſee the Croſſes and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions
that will happen to me. God
preſerve us, for your Eminence will
not be long after the Queen, when God
ſhall call her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Azzolini,</hi> who heard the firſt words
of the <hi>Sybil,</hi> without Emotion, was
troubled at the laſt, and turn'd his
Back all in Confuſion.</p>
            <p>She repented that ſhe had ſaid ſo
much, for her Predictions were but too
true, whether it were that ſhe was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
Inſpir'd from Heaven, or
Chance and Conjecture, that made her
to advance things, I know not, but the
Event confirm'd them.</p>
            <p>She had alſo told the Queen, that the
Pope would die the ſame Year, in the
Canicular days, and he Deceas'd the
13th of <hi>Auguſt</hi> next following.</p>
            <p>He was inform'd of theſe Predictions
of the <hi>Sybil,</hi> and was ſo diſpleas'd, that
as ſoon as ever the Queen's Eyes were
clos'd, he caus'd her to be taken up,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:54799:162"/>
and Impriſoned in the Caſtle of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo,</hi>
where ſhe remain'd till her dying-day.</p>
            <p>She ſaid ſomething alſo of <hi>Alexander</hi>
VIII. but he changed her Priſon into
a Conſervatory, where ſhe conſum'd and
pin'd away for Grief.</p>
            <p>At a time when the Queen did not think
of Death, ſhe had a mind to Beſpeak a
magnificent Tomb. She ſent for for
her Graver, called <hi>Francis Marie Anco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitano,</hi>
and order'd divers Models, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
telling him of any Place where it
ſhould be ſet up. The Graver being
buſie, and not having his Meaſures rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to extend his Figures and Bas Reliefs
there, the Queen was forc'd to tell him
ſhe would have it made round, like the
Pantheon of <hi>Agrippa</hi> in old time. At the
ſame time ſhe forbad him to ſpeak a
Syllable to any Perſon about it, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all, enjoyn'd him, that Cardinal
<hi>Azzolini</hi> ſhould know nothing of it.
However, the thing was ſo long in Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> came to
know of it, and was affrighted at the
vaſt Expence of bringing it to Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
but however durſt ſay nothing of
it to the Queen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:54799:162"/>
This had pleaſant Conſequences, for
when the Intrigue came to be known,
the Graver was turn'd off, though he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
to her Majeſty, that he could
not make his Models with ſo much cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but that Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> might
get an inkling of it.</p>
            <p>The Queen having ask'd him, what
the Expence of the whole might amount
to, he told her ingenuouſly, that an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand Crowns would not finiſh
it.</p>
            <p>You're a Rogue, ſaid ſhe to him, an
hundred thouſand Crowns, I would
ſpend a Milion upon't. The Cardinal
hearing this, fell a Laughing, knowing
that all her Eſtate, did not amount to
half a Million. And after all, ſhe was
poorly Interr'd in a Cave of the <hi>Sacraſty</hi>
of St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſhews the Genius of the Queen,
who would do every thing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;
and with the Magnificence due
to her Character.</p>
            <p>But finally, it muſt be ſaid in Praiſe
of this Generous Princeſs, that ſhe died
with an Intrepidity worthy of the
Daughter of the Great <hi>Guſtavus Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:54799:163"/>
Her Relapſe having taken from her
all hope of Cure, ſhe very early took
care of her Soul; She Confeſs'd with
great Sentiments of Contrition; and
receiv'd the Holy Sacrament with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
reſpect, and unſpeakable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
Finding her Strength to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh,
ſhe ſent to deſire the Pope's Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
praying him to forgive all the
Differences, that had been between them,
which yet had not hinder'd her from
being inviolably fixt to the Intereſts of
the Holy See; and that ſhe had always a
great reſpect and eſteem for the Perſon
of <hi>Innocent</hi> 11th.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, ſhe Sign'd her laſt Will
and Teſtament, and preſented it to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Azzolini,</hi> which he told her, was
advantagious to her Majeſty's Houſhold,
though he made it only according to
his own Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Sclavata,</hi> a famous Diſcalceat
<hi>Bohemian Carmelite,</hi> exhorted her to
prepare for Death; ſometimes ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Latin, and ſometimes German, or
French.</p>
            <p>At laſt the Queen Died, <hi>April</hi> 19th.
1689, at Six of the Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
and her Body was carried next
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:54799:163"/>
day, towards Night, to the New Church
of the Fathers of the Oratory of St. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip
Neri,</hi> being Embalm'd and Cloath'd
in the ſame Habit, which was deſign'd for
her Funeral Solemnity. It was carried in
a Coach, accompanied by the Cardinals
Chaplains, and the Curate of St. <hi>Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>'s
Pariſh.</p>
            <p>The day following, the Queens Body
was expos'd upon a Bed of Parade, with
a Royal Crown upon her Head, and
a Scepter in her Hand, in the Body of
the Church, and round about her 300
Flambeaux of white Wax. The Church
was hung with Mourning, with Eſcut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheons
of her Majeſties Arms, and with
Counterfeit Bas-reliefs of Black Marble,
which alluded to the Vanity of Life,
and certainty of Death.</p>
            <p>Her Obſequies were very Magnificent,
and the whole Colledge of Cardinals
aſſiſted, and <hi>Azzolini</hi> appear'd in deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Mourning, with the greateſt Lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Dejection. Towards Night, the
Queen's Body was tranſported upon the
ſame Bed of Parade, with her Face diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd,
to the Church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> at
the <hi>Vatican,</hi> the Con-fraternities of the
Regular and Secular Clergy, the Canons
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:54799:164"/>
of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and her Domeſticks in
Mourning, going before; The Counts
of <hi>Warwick, Vaſenau,</hi> and two other
Lords of Note, holding the four Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Pall. The Pope accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
the Body, by the Officers of the
<hi>Papal Houſe,</hi> as is done when the Dean
of the Cardinals, and the Ambaſſadors
of Crowned Heads die at <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She was Inhumed in the <hi>Sacriſti</hi> of St.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s, an Honour done to no body but
Cardinals, and Arch-prieſts of St. <hi>Peter;</hi>
for in the Church it ſelf, none are Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but Popes only. And 'tis ſaid, that
the Pope would have erected a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
Tomb for her, if he had liv'd any
time longer.</p>
            <p>Thus did Queen <hi>Chriſtina Alexandra</hi>
of <hi>Sueden,</hi> teſtifie all along more Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Grandeur of Soul at her Death,
than ſhe had ſhewed Conſtancy in her
Life: Her Inequalities, Ambition, and
vain Occupations, had much diminiſh'd
the Eſteem whith the Publick had of her
Magnanimity. She always loved Change
except in Religion, which when once
ſhe had found to be true, ſhe embrac'd
it ſo firmly, that nothing could Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
her. In all other things, ſhe ſhew'd
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:54799:164"/>
her ſelf a true Woman, that is to ſay
changeable. She affected to paſs for
a Maid, and the word Woman of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
her horribly. So that for fear
of Offending her, you muſt ſay for
Example, <hi>Your Majeſty has moſt excellent
Maiden-hair, and not Woman's;</hi> and ſo of
the reſt.</p>
            <p>She had Eloquence, Spoke well, and
Wrote better, even in many Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
but above all in <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian.</hi>
The Learned do yet admire her Letters
to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> upon the raiſing
the Siege of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and the Battle of
<hi>Barcan,</hi> to the Chevalier <hi>Terlon,</hi> upon
the revocation of the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi>
and to Cardinal <hi>Azzolini,</hi> upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment
of the Pope's Penſion, and
others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One day hearing of the Death of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimir
<hi>King of</hi> Poland, <hi>in the Abby of
St.</hi> Germain de Pre, <hi>at</hi> Paris. <hi>She ſaid,</hi>
I am very glad to hear that he is Dead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Men, for if he had ſtaid in his own
Country, he had died among Beaſts.</p>
            <p>She lov'd neither Bigots in Religion,
nor Atheiſts. She had a true regard to
Piety, though in her Youth, the Abbot
<hi>Bourdelot</hi> and other Libertines, ſhook
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:54799:165"/>
her Religion. She participated of the
Holy Sacraments, and after ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the Impoſtures of <hi>Molinos,</hi> who
would have Seduc'd her, ſhe was the
more confirmed in the true Faith. She
trok care that her Domeſticks ſhould
practice all the Duties Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,
and go to the Communion in
general three times a Year, as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
did. She heard <hi>Maſs</hi> every day,
unleſs ſome Indiſpoſition hinder'd her;
and ſometimes ſhe had ſo tender a ſenſe
in Religion, that one could not wiſh
more even in a Capucin. One day look<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing
upon the Picture of the Great <hi>Guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus</hi>
her Father, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Ah poor</hi> Guſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus!
<hi>What great things haſt thou done in
thy Life! But what haſt thou done for thy
Soul? I thank God for his favour in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
me to underſtand the Truth, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
me to enter into the good way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She ſaid, that of all the Sacraments,
ſhe held that of Confeſſion to be the
moſt uſeful. That in truth the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi>
did practice it, though not in Form,
and that a good Confeſſion was the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of Vice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="315" facs="tcp:54799:165"/>
One day as ſhe went to an Audience of
the Pope, ſhe ſaid to the Women
which Dreſs'd her, <hi>Cover my Breasts
well, for fear</hi> Mingon <hi>ſhould be angry.</hi>
For he ſtood upon the moſt minute
things, which are ſo much the more
indecent, in that they are not Evils he
rebukes.</p>
            <p>To what purpoſe ſhould the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the World, wear the Habit
of <hi>Beguines?</hi> Put them under what
Habit you will, they will always find
ſome agreement to pleaſe the Men.</p>
            <p>Another time when ſhe went to the
Pope, to ſhew her Obedience, ſhe
dreſs'd her ſelf and all the Ladies of
her Court, in a ſort of a Robe which
they call <hi>Innocentian,</hi> being long Veſts
which trail upon the Ground, cloſe
before, and ſtrait Sleeves which come
as far as the Wriſts, and ſo cloſe at
the Neck, you could ſcarce ſee her Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
of Pearl. To this fine Habit, ſhe
likewiſe added ſome few knots of
Ribbands. None of her Woman could
hardly forbear Laughing. But other
<hi>Roman</hi> Ladies Laugh'd at them outright,
and ſaid, The Queen might make as
many Apes as ſhe pleas'd, but ſhe ſhould
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:54799:166"/>
not make them Monkies, by imitating
her Faſhion.</p>
            <p>This Princeſs hated, or pretended
to hate Marriage; inſomuch, that at
her firſt coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhe could
not endure any Married People in her
Service. When <hi>Landini</hi> was big with
Child, ſhe would not ſee her, and if
ſhe had occaſion for her, ſhe would ſay,
<hi>Bring the Cow hither,</hi> and ſend her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
again as ſoon as ſhe has done.</p>
            <p>When ſhe had made the Marriage of
<hi>Beauregard,</hi> ſhe ſaid to the Husband,
<hi>God ſend thee the Signs of the Zodiack;</hi>
and to you <hi>Beauregard,</hi> (ſays ſhe to the
woman) <hi>If you come to ſhew like a
Cow, do not come to ſee me in that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſhe was quite otherwiſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Marquiſs <hi>Caponi,</hi> for ſhe
would cauſe his firſt Child to be
brought to her, Careſs it, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
hold it in her Arms; and when
the little Child began to go, and came
to the Table to Embrace her Feet, ſhe
would fill his little Apron with Fruits
and Comfitures.</p>
            <p>Though ſhe was a huge Eater, as
the <hi>Northern</hi> People are, ſhe drank al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:54799:166"/>
no Wine. She lov'd rather Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers,
or boil'd Cheſtnuts with her
Maids, for which ſhe would ſlip into
their Chambers on purpoſe, rather
than eat the delicate Morſels which
were prepar'd for her with royal Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence.
The Sieur <hi>Romulus Spoziola,</hi>
her Phyſician, Remonſtrating to her, that
it was not good for her Health, ſhe
call'd him Drunkard and Beaſt, and ſaid
he knew no more than her Cap.</p>
            <p>Her Taylor trying on a Coat one
day when ſhe had been let Blood,
prayed her not to force her Arm; but
ſhe gave him a Box on the Ear, with
the ſame Hand, which fill'd the poor
Advice-monger with Confuſion.</p>
            <p>She was often at Difference with the
Ambaſſador <hi>D'Eſtrees;</hi> But as ſhe had no
Gall, ſhe was very glad to make Peace
with him. One day as he was at the
Vineyard of <hi>Pamphilio,</hi> ſhe coming thither
by chance, and perceiving him there,
ran to him and made him an hundred
Civilities, inſomuch that ſhe mounted
a little Horſe of Monſieur the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador,
and made him turn and Prance
in his Preſence, above half an Hour,
with a very good Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:54799:167"/>
Another time as ſhe was driving a
Calaſh in the Alley's of her Garden, ſhe
asked one of the Ambaſſador's Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
that ſhe found there by chance,
whether ſte did not Drive well? He
told her, that there was no body but
her ſelf and the King of <hi>France</hi> that
knew how to drive a Coach well. She
was ſtung with this Anſwer, and run
like a Fool up and down the Field:
But the Calaſh Overturn'd, and her
Majeſty came to the Ground with her
Coats upwards, and cried out for
Help. And becauſe no Man durſt
come near her in this condition, ſhe
Laugh'd at their fooliſh Shame, ſaying,
<hi>I am not ſorry I am ſeen by this Accident,
to the end it may be known that I am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Male nor Hermophrodite, as ſome
People in the World have paſs'd me for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the Queen had an infinite deal of
Wit, ſhe believ'd therefore that ſhe
ought to have a proportionable Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Policy; but ſhe took little
care to ſhew it, and would not take the
trouble upon her to be ſo much upon
her Guard, as to make a decent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:54799:167"/>
She freely follow'd her own Genius
in all things, and car'd not what any
body ſaid. She maintain'd all her Life
an Emulation and ſecret Envy againſt
the King and <hi>French</hi> Nation, though
otherwiſe ſhe infinitely eſteem'd that
Monarch, and took him for the Model
of her Conduct, ſaying, She would
make a little Queen of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Rome;</hi>
yet ſhe let ſlip no opportunity to ſpeak
evil of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, either to
leſſen their Advantages, or magnifie their
Faults.</p>
            <p>'Twas in in this mind, that being
one Night at a Comedy at the Theatre
<hi>Tour de None,</hi> in Company with the
Cardinals <hi>Roſpiglioſi,</hi> and <hi>Altieri.</hi> She ſaid
to the firſt, <hi>Is it true then that the Army
of Marſhal</hi> Turenne <hi>is entirely Defeated
in Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know not Madam, (anwer'd <hi>Roſpig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioſi</hi>
coldly, but we have this Night a
new Muſician in the <hi>Opera</hi> will advance
the luſtre of the Theatre; Tis <hi>Fede,</hi>
who knows ſo well how to Charm
the Ear, that your Majeſty will not be
uneaſie to hear the Singing, as you were
Yeſter-night. This enrag'd the Queen,
who turn'd her Back upon him, to
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:54799:168"/>
ſpeak to Cardinal <hi>Altieri,</hi> concerning
the Conſequences of this pretended
Defeat, asking him if General <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuculi</hi>
would find reſiſtance, if he Sack'd
all, even as far as <hi>Paris?</hi> He anſwer'd,
That he had never been in War, and
that he did not know how the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
would go. She then ſpoke to
him againſt Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtrees,</hi> with
whom he had ſome Miſunderſtanding.
But as <hi>Altieri</hi> was a refin'd Polititian,
who knew how to hide his Sentiments,
for fear of prejudicing his Intereſts,
turn'd off the Diſcourſe with ſuch a
preſence of Mind, that the Queen could
draw no Advantage againſt <hi>D'Eſtrees,</hi>
with whom ſhe would fall out, and was
Reconciled as often, and had occaſion to
make uſe of him at that preſent.</p>
            <p>After the Queen's Death, Cardinal
<hi>Azzolini</hi> was very willing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
and enter into the favour of
Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtrees;</hi> but he liv'd ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
a time after, that he had not lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
However it is certain, it was
not long of him, and to prove this, I
will inſert here a Letter, written to
me from <hi>Leghorn,</hi> from the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
who ſent me a Relation touching
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:54799:168"/>
the Affair of the Quarters. See here the
Contents.</p>
            <p>I ſhould fear the Relation would
want ſomething, If I ſhould not inform
you of the laſt Sentiments of Monſieur
Cardinal <hi>Azzolini,</hi> for Monſieur Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

Death of Queen <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> Monſieur
Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> ſent for me, and
ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">MY little Compere (for he had
done me the Honour to be
Godfather to my Child) I would
communicate to to you an Affair of
greateſt Importance. 'Tis believ'd,
that I have been an Enemy to the
Crown of <hi>France.</hi> It was never true,
for I eſteem my King as much as any
of his Subjects. I ſay, my King,
for I have always had a ſtrong Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
for this great Monarch. And
many of my Letters ſhew, that this
Diſgrace has happen'd to me from
being too much engag'd in the Queens
Intereſts. And notwithſtanding the
Differences I have had with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtrees,</hi> I am his
Servant and Friend. In ſhort, my</hi>
               <pb n="322" facs="tcp:54799:169"/>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">Compere, the Queen is Dead, and
had made me her Heir, as you know
very well. She has left me very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
things of all ſorts, and there
is none but my King to whom theſe
things deſerve to be Preſented. And
know that no Intereſt moves me to
do this; I contend only for the
Honour, that he would accept theſe
Teſtimonies of my good Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Monſigneur,</hi> ſaid to him, If you
will permit me to ſpeak my Thoughts
to your Eminence; I do not believe the
King will accept theſe things as a pure
Gift.</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">All the World knows, (Anſwer'd
he, that the King of <hi>France,</hi> is the
moſt Generous of all Princes, but
we do not act with Kings as we
do with Merchants; All that I wiſh
is, that he will do me the Honour
to accept them. You are a good
<hi>Frenchman,</hi> and have a love for your
Country; I have known you a long
time, and I confide in you, becauſe
I am perſwaded I ſhall find you Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
You know I have opened my
Deſign to Monſieur <hi>Alibert,</hi> and he
would be overjoy'd to have it done</hi>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:54799:169"/>
               <hi rend="margQuotes">by his Means. But ſome Reaſons
oblige me to Prefer you. You have
ſome Acquaintance with Monſieur
Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtrees.</hi> Endeavour to
inſinuate to his Eminence, as from
your ſelf, that he ought not to let
this occaſion ſlip; and that if he will
undertake it, he ſhall be Maſter of
all. I know your Conduct in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and it will make your For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
if you bring this about.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After ſo fair an Inſtruction, I took
leave of his Eminence, and the ſame
day, I made it my buſineſs to ſee the
Cardinal, under pretence of thanking
him for the Protection he had gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
given me, upon the occaſion of a
Quarrel I had with a <hi>Suede,</hi> who had
ſpoken ill things of the Queen. The
Diſcourſe fell afterwards inſenſibly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the fine Moveables the Queen had
left to Cardinal <hi>Azzolini:</hi> And I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
to his Eminence, that the
Medals and Manuſcripts of her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
and above all, the Pictures of <hi>Paul
Varoneſe</hi> and <hi>Cortege,</hi> were Originals of
an ineſtimable Value, and fit to be
preſented to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:54799:170"/>
Monſieur the Cardinal was of the
ſame mind; and I told him in few
words the Intentions of Cardinal <hi>Az<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zolini,</hi>
giving him an Account of the
Converſation I had with him. His
Eminence took it well that I had free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcovered the Truth to him, and
order'd me to ſee the Cardinal often,
and to tell him directly, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
was in the fault, if the Rarities
of the Queen's Palace did not come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King's Hands; and that aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he would looſe nothing by it.</p>
            <p>Two days after I went to Cardinal
<hi>Azzolini,</hi> and gave him an account of
my Negotiation, aſſuring him, that
Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtrees</hi> had writ to Court
about it. He was then Indiſpos'd and
in Bed, but ſhew'd a great deal of Joy
that I had begun ſo well, and giving
me his Hand, which I reſpectfully
Kiſſing, he promis'd me he would not
be Ungrateful, if the Affair ſucceeded.
I was perfectly overjoy'd and fill'd
with the fineſt Hopes in the World,
but they quickly vaniſh'd, for the Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this poor Lord did ſo encreaſe,
that there was no ſpeaking with him.
However, I did not ſtir from his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:54799:170"/>
and gave an exact account of his
Sickneſs to Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtrees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame day that Cardinal <hi>Azzo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lini</hi>
was given over by his Phyſicians;
his Eminence went himſelf to know the
State of his Health, juſt at Twelve a
Clock, and came thither from the
Congregation of the holy Office. It
was in <hi>June,</hi> and in the hotteſt time
of the day, which made me think
'twas out of Policy, becauſe he would
not be oblig'd to go up.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Azzolini</hi> being advertiz'd,
that Monſieur Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtrees</hi> ſcop'd
his Coach at the Gate, to Enquire how
he did, either Rejoyc'd ſo much, or
ſo well diſſembled it, that his Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
melted thoſe that heard him. Is
it poſſible, ſays he, that his Eminence
ſhould come to Viſit ſuch a poor Sick
Perſon as my ſelf? I ſhall reckon this
day the happieſt in all my Life, and I
wiſh its prolongation for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
but to embrace ſo good a Lord.
Deſire him nevertheleſs not to incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode
himſelf by coming up, for fear
the great Heat ſhould do an injury to
his Health, for the preſervation of
which, I would Sacrifice my own.</p>

Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtrees</hi> anſwer'd this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with ſuch Expreſſions as were
yet more Obliging, and ſaid to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Chamber, all that the moſt
tender Friendſhip conld think of, to
perſwade a ſincere Reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two Friends, who had lived
ſome time in a Miſintelligence one with
another. The Maſter of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
went many times up and down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, each of their Eminencies
being deſirous to have the laſt word.</p>
            <p>If I had not been preſent at all theſe
Diſcourſes, I ſhould never have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
it. And becauſe Diſſimulation
cannot be carried ſo far in ſuch a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture,
I am verily perſwaded, that
it was Sincere, and that Policy had no
hand in it; my ſelf being very much
Edified by ſuch a Proceeding.</p>

Who would ever have believ'd that
a little Gentleman of <hi>Marca d' Ancona</hi>
ſhould become Heir to the Daughter
of the Great <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus</hi> the
Terror of <hi>Germany:</hi> And yet it has
happen'd to <hi>Pompey Azzolini,</hi> Nephew
to the Cardinal of that Name, by which
he is become Maſter of that Rich Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
by the greateſt Fortune in the
World. If his Uncle had died before
the Queen, as he died immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſhe would have diſpos'd of the
Succeſſion after another manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe did not love this Nephew at
all. The Cardinal put him into the
number of her Majeſties Gentlemen,
but it was to be a Spy upon her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.
And one day ſhe gave him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ill Language, becauſe he diſcover'd
to his Uncle, that the Queen went out
in the Night with the Marquiſs <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni</hi>
in a Cloſe Coach, to go to a Ball,
ſtopping afterwards at Monſieur <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronio</hi>'s,
where ſhe ſpent the Night
very Pleaſantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey Azzolini</hi> did not quietly enjoy
his Inheritance; and the ready Money
went for the moſt part to pay the
Charges and Legacies of the Will. The
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:54799:172"/>
reſt conſiſted in fine Moveables, which
were bought upon Credit, by divers
great Lords, who as to all appearance,
will not Pay in a long time, becauſe they
are above the purſuit of Juſtice. Pope
<hi>Alexander</hi> VIII. bought the Queen's
fine Library, which was ſo rich in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcripst,
for a piece of Bread. Don
<hi>Livio Odeſcalchi,</hi> Nephew of <hi>Innocent</hi>
XI. had the Cabinet of Medals, of
which there was ſo fine Setts in all
ſorts of Metals. The Pictures are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd
here and there; and ſo the reſt:
So that there is no great matter remains
now to <hi>Pompey Azzolini:</hi> and ſeeing he
took no Pains to get it, it is not reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
he ſhould enjoy alone the Spoils
of ſo great a Princeſs, while her Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks,
who have Served her ſo long,
remain in Miſery.</p>
