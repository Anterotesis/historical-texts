         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And note, that in ſuch <note place="margin">Nota.</note> caſe one preſcribed for eight Loads of Wood to be cut and taken, as appertaining to a Meſſuage, which was held naught by the whole Court, for the Preſcription ſhould be laid for Eſtovers to be imployed upon Repairs of the ſaid Meſſuage, or to be ſpent in it: for a man cannot preſcribe to have a Preſcription to come and cut down my Wood, which is as much as I that have the Free-hold can do. For the claim to take and ſell my Wood cannot be good. And the Court held it a good Preſcription, to preſcribe to have Common every other year, although you ſhew not the Commencement, as to ſhew what time of the year when it begins. If a man hath Common of Paſture, in divers Cloſes and parcels of Ground, where he hath ſome Land of his own, there, and in all other caſes where one is to preſcribe, he need not to make his Title to every peice, but to ſay, he hath Common <hi>in loco in quo, &amp;c. int. alia,</hi> and need not to ſpeak of the reſt of the Land in the reſidue of the Feild, becauſe he hath Land of his own.

Action of Debt <note place="margin">One Bond can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not overthrow the other.</note> brought upon an Obligation for the Paiment of Money at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Day ſpecified in the Condition. The Defendant pleads, that the Plaintiff at the Day of Payment accepts of another Bond for the Payment of the ſaid Money, in ſatisfaction of the ſaid 52. <hi>l. 11. s.</hi> and upon a Demurrer held to be a naughty Plea, for one Bond cannot overthrow another.</p>

                        <hi>LEa</hi> verſus <hi>Pain, Hill. 14. Jacobi rotulo</hi> 953. An Action of Debt <note place="margin">Exceptions to an Award, pretending the Arbitrators had exceeded their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged good.</note> brought upon an Obligation with a Condition to perform an Award, the Defendant pleads, that the Arbitrators made no Award. The Plaintiff by way of Replication ſets forth an Award, that the Arbitrators did arbitrate of all matters, untill the Date of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which was a Moneth longer then the Submiſſion, and ſo pretends they exceeded their Authority. The words were for all cauſes before the Date of the Award. Another Exception was, becauſe the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators awarded that the Defendant ſhould pay the Plaintiff ſuch a Day of <hi>April,</hi> and doth not ſay, what year, or next following: and the Court held that good enough, becauſe the ſecond Day of Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was made to be ſuch a Day, and ſuch a year: and it was held good enough, for if any new matters did ariſe between the Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Award, or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Defendant ought to ſhew it. Another Exception was, that it was not ſaid, that the Award was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Parties, but it ſhall be intended to be made between the Parties, becauſe the Award was made <hi>de &amp; ſuper praemiſſis,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall be implied, that it was made but of ſuch things as they had power to deal in. The Court was of opinion, that the Award be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>de &amp; ſuper praemiſſis,</hi> the Court ſhall not ſay, but that this was a cauſe ſubmitted; and except it had been diſcovered by pleading, that there was a new cauſe ſince the Date of the Award, which was made known to the Wardſmen, the Court is not to take notice thereof.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>SCot</hi> Executor <hi>verſus Herbert.</hi> The Plaintiff in his Declaration ſayes the Teſtator in his life-time was poſſeſſed of Land for a <note place="margin">Judgement for the Defendant, for inſufficiency in the Count.</note> terme of years; and ſo poſſeſſed grants part of his terme to an Eſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, reſerving Rent, and he grants his Eſtate to the Defendant. And that the Teſtator died poſſeſſed of the Reverſion of the terme, and becauſe the Rent was behinde, the Executor brings his Action of Debt for the Rent, and the Declaration was held naught, for that it did not appear that he that made the firſt Demiſe was ſeiſed in Fee, or in any other Eſtate by which he could make a Leaſe.</p>

An Action of Debt brought, and the Plaintiffs declare that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had incorporated them by ſuch a name, and given them Power to make by-laws, for the better governing their Corporation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and further ſhew that they made an Order which was confirmed by the Juſtices of Aſſiſe according to the Statute of 19 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and for the Breach of ſuch Order brought their Action: the Defendant pleaded that he owed them nothing,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41383:28"/>
and tried, and a Verdict for the Plaintiffs, and <hi>Hutton</hi> Serjeant moved in Arreſt of Judgement, and took three Exceptions: the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Conſtitution was againſt Law, to reſtrain one to exerciſe a lawfull Trade. The ſecond, the Conſtitution was, that the Offender ſhould forfeit ſuch a ſumm, and it did not appear to whom this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture ſhould go. Thirdly, the Plaintiff ſhews in his Count, that the Queen by her Letters Patents had appointed <hi>A. B. C.</hi> to be War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens for one year, and ſhews not which thoſe that brought the Action were elected, which ought to be, to intitle them to that Action. It was againſt ſenſe to barr all their own Apprentices, it doth not appear how many Wardens ſhould be, and they do not intitle them to the Action by the Corporation, the Law is altered; and Judgement was given for the Defendant.</p>

                        <hi>BRet</hi> verſus <hi>Averder, Mich. 29. &amp; 30. Eliz.</hi> Debt brought upon <note place="margin">The Defendant at his perill ought to make Payment.</note> an Obligation, to perform an Arbitrement: the Defendant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes the Arbitrement, but pleads in Barr, that the Plaintiff did not require him to make Payment, and to that Plea the Plaintiff demurrs; and it was adjudged no Plea; for the Defendant at his perill ought to make Payment, and the Plaiutiff ought not to make a Requeſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>HAles</hi> verſus <hi>Bell, Trin. 39. Eliz. rotulo</hi> 1974. The Plaintiff <note place="margin">If part of a Condition be to be performed within the Realm, and part without, ought to be tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able here.</note> brought an Action of Dèbt upon an Obligation, with a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Payment of 40. <hi>l.</hi> within fourteen Dayes next after the return of one <hi>Ruſſell</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> from the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> and then the Obligation ſhould be void; the Defendant pleads in Barr, that the ſaid <hi>Ruſſell</hi> was not at <hi>Venice,</hi> upon which Plea the Plaintiff demurrs; and adjudged a naughty Plea; for where part is to be done within the Realm, and part out of the Realm, the Plea ought to be triable within the Realm.</p>

                        <hi>GArret</hi> verſus <hi>Harriſon</hi> Executor, <hi>Trin. 40. Eliz. rotulo</hi> 1651. To <note place="margin">Defendant pleaded ſix Judgements in Barr, and two found to be by fraud, and Judgement for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff.</note> an Action of Debt upon a Bond brought againſt him as Executor; the Defendant pleads ſix Judgements in Barr; the Plaintiff replies, that they were by fraud and covin; and the Jury found for the Plaintiff, that two of the ſix were by covin; and <hi>Williams</hi> moved in Arreſt of Judgement, becauſe the Jury ought to have found all; but <hi>Glanvile</hi> ſaid, that if any part of the Plea be inſufficient, defective, or falſe, the Iſſue ſhall be found againſt you, for your Plea is one intire thing; and he ſaid, that the Plaintiff ſhould have taken Iſſue upon one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in an Obligation, with diverſe things in the Condition. <hi>Walmſley</hi> held, that by the Plea the Defendant had confeſſed implicatively, that you have ſufficient to ſatisfie thoſe ſix Judgements, and no more. So that if any part be found againſt you, this is Aſſets; and Judgement was given accordingly for the Plaintiff.</p>

                        <hi>GReen</hi> verſus <hi>Wilcox</hi> Executor. To an Action upon an Obligation brought againſt the Defendant as Executor, he pleads that the Teſtator was obliged to <hi>A.</hi> in 20. <hi>l.</hi> which remained due to him at his Death; and that the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> recorded againſt him in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas, and averres that it was a true Debt, and the perſons and matters to be the ſame, and that he had no Aſſetts beyond that; and the Plaintiff replies, that the ſaid Recovery was had by fraud and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin between them, to defraud him of his Debt; to which Plea the Defendant demurrs, ſpecially becauſe he had in his Plea averred, it was a true and juſt Debt, ſo that it could not be by covin.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Trin. 44. Eliz.</hi> It was adjudged for Law by the whole Court, that <note place="margin">The Sheriff cannot break open the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Door to do Execution, but that being open he may break open any other.</note> if a <hi>Fieri facias</hi> be directed and delivered to the Sheriff, he may not break the outer Door of the Houſe, and enter, and do Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but if the outer Door be open, then he may enter by that, and then he may and ought to break the Door of an Entry or Chamber which is locked, and break open any Cheſt which is locked, and take the Goods in that in Execution; and if he doth it not, an Action of Caſe will lie againſt him.</p>
                     <p>In Debt, if it be demanded by Original, the Proceſs is Summons, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, and Diſtreſs; and for Default of ſufficiency upon a <hi>Nichil,</hi> returned Proceſs to the Outlary, if the Summons or Attachment be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, an Eſſoyn lies. And Wager of Law lies if the Count be upon a ſimple Contract. And if the Parties be living which made the Contract or Debt againſt an Heir, the Writ ſhall be brought in the <hi>Debet;</hi> but when it is brought againſt an Executor, or Adminiſtrator, or of Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, it ſhall be in the <hi>Detinet tantum.</hi> The Judgement in Debt where the Demand is in the <hi>Debet &amp; detinet,</hi> is to recover the Debt, Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Coſts of Suit; and the Defendant in <hi>miſericordia:</hi> but if the Defendant denies his Deed, then a <hi>Capias</hi> for his Fine iſſues out. And if the Original be in the <hi>Detinet</hi> for Chattels, then the Judgement is to recover the thing in Demand, or the value thereof, and Coſts, and Damages; and the Proceſs of Execution is a Diſtreſs to deliver the Chattels, or the value, and Damages. And if the cauſe of Action be againſt Executors or Adminiſtrators, the Judgement is to recover the Debt and Damages of the Teſtators Goods, if the Executor hath ſo much in his hands, and if he hath not, then the Damages of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors or Adminiſtrators proper Goods. And if the Sheriff upon a <hi>Scire facias</hi> return a <hi>Devastavit,</hi> then a <hi>Fieri facias,</hi> or <hi>Elegit,</hi> may be ſued out to levy the Debt and Damages of the Executors or Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators proper Goods. And if the Executor plead, that he never was Executor, and it is found againſt him that he hath adminiſtred but one Penny, the Judgement ſhall be to recover the Debt and Damages of the Executors own Goods. Debt brought upon a Record, the

In pleading of a Statute it muſt be generally pleaded, that it is a true Debt. And my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> held, that a man without a Defeaſance may plead, that the Statute was acknowledged for Payment of a leſſer ſumm; and it was held, that if the Count be good, and the Plea naught, and Replication naught, if it appears that the Plaintiff had good cauſe of Action, the Plaintiff ſhall have Judgement. And <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton</hi> ſaid, that one may plead generally, that the Statute was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by fraud, without ſhewing the ſpecial matter.</p>

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41383:47"/>
not ſhew it, for the Condition of the Recogniſance depends upon two Clauſes, one the Appearance at 8.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:41383:58"/>
becauſe it appeared upon Record, that the prayer of the <hi>Elegits</hi> was made the eight and twentieth of <hi>November,</hi> the laſt day of the Term, and by the <hi>Teſtatum</hi> it is ſuppoſed that the Sheriffes of <hi>London</hi> had returned <hi>quindena Martini</hi> which is before the eight and twentieth of <hi>November,</hi> that the Defendant had nothing in <hi>London,</hi> which ſeemed to be contrary to the Record, yet that is not materiall, but makes the matter more vitious, for it may well be, that ſince the Judgement was <hi>Craſtino animarum,</hi> a <hi>Teſtatum</hi> might not iſſue out returnable <hi>Quindena Martini,</hi> and it ſhall be the Plaintiffes fault that he did not file it, and it ſhall be preſumed to be ſuch a Writ, as the Plaintiffs own Proceſſe doth recite, and note that the whole Court did adjudge in this Caſe, that <hi>Goodier</hi> ſhould be reſtored to the Term again, and although it was valued by the Jury, but at a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, and delivered to <hi>Jounce</hi> the Plaintiff to hold as his own Goods and Chattells, yet <hi>Goodier</hi> ſhall have it again from <hi>Jounce,</hi> for he being the party himſelf, it is in Law but a bare delivery <hi>in ſpecie,</hi> and therefore ought to be reſtored in <hi>ſpecie</hi> again, and doth not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely alter the property, but attends upon the Execution to be good or naught, as the Execution is, and ſo it was adjudged before, in <hi>Robothams</hi> Caſe, and alſo in <hi>Worrells</hi> Caſe, as Mr. <hi>Noy</hi> ſaid to <hi>Yelverton,</hi> but it had been otherwiſe, if the ſute had been to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranger, by the Sheriff of the Term, for a hundred pounds accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the opinion of 28 <hi>Eliz.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41383:58"/>
a year, and therefore the Plaintiff had miſtaken his demand in ſuing for twenty Marks, for one half year, (for theſe words <hi>ad Terminos praedictos)</hi> are onely the time of payment of the twenty Marks which were to be paid as the thirty pounds were, and although in the clauſe that reſerved the Rent to the Heirs, the words (by equall portions) were omitted, yet the Law will ſupply them, as it is in the 13 <hi>H. 9. Avowry</hi> 2. 40. Rent granted to be taken at two Termes of the year, and they named it ſhall be intended by equall portions, although the Deed makes mention of that, for the reſervation being the Act of the Leſſor, ſhall be taken moſt ſtrongly againſt him and his Heirs, and therefore ſhall have but twenty Marks for all the whole year, and no more, as in <hi>Perkins</hi> 22, two tenements in common make a Leaſe, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring ten ſhillings, it ſhall be five ſhillings to each of them <hi>March</hi> 171. according to it the ſecond cauſe of the Judgement was becauſe the Plaintiff brought this Action as Heire to his Father, and doth not ſhew in his Declaration, that the Reverſion deſcends to him, and the Rent demanded, is incident to the Reverſion diſcended, and ſo the Plaintiff doth not make any Title to have the Rent, which mark, and Judgement was given, that the Plaintiff ſhould take nothing by his Bill.</p>

The Plaintiff <note place="margin">One muſt not plead in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Obligation, but of the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contained in the Obligation.</note> brought an Action of Debt upon an obligation for fourteen pounds, the condition was that if the Defendant ſhould pay ſeven pounds to the Plaintiff upon the birth-day of the Child of <hi>John</hi> living which God ſhall ſend after the Date of the Bond then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant pleads, that the Plaintiff after the making of the Obligation and before the birth of any Infant of the ſaid <hi>J.</hi> living to wit the 1. <hi>September 7.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41383:59"/>
of the Condition, but of the Obligation, and therefore it is <note place="margin">A contingent Debt cannot be diſcharged.</note> not good, which mark. Secondly, it appears that the Condition it ſelf cannot be diſcharged; for the ſeven pounds is not due nor paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble untill the Birth of the Childe of <hi>John</hi> living, which is a meer Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingency, and remote poſſibility, whether he ſhall ever have a Childe or no; and therefore it reſting in Contingency, whether it will ever be a Debt or no, it cannot be diſcharged; for a poſſibility cannot be releaſed, as it hath been adjudged in <hi>Carters</hi> Caſe, and it is not to be reſembled to the Caſe where the Condition is to pay Money at a Day to come, for that may be diſcharged preſently, for it is preſently a Duty, although it be not demandable untill the Day; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore becauſe it cannot be known whether the Day will ever come wherein <hi>John</hi> will have a Childe; and becauſe it is no Debt nor Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, therefore it cannot be diſcharged, by the opinion of the whole Court.</p>

Secondly, the Defendant did not ſhew that the Debts due to the ſuppoſed Creditors were by ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and then the matter of his Plea is not good, for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant cannot plead ſuch a Plea, but to excuſe himſelf of a <hi>Devaſtavit,</hi>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:41383:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that could not be as this Caſe is, for he being Adminiſtrator is not chargeable with the Debts, if they be not upon Specialty. Thirdly, the Defendant ſuppoſed that it would be a <hi>Devastavit</hi> in him, if he ſhould deliver the Goods to the Plaintiff which were contained in the Deed of Gift, but that cannot be, for thoſe Goods in the hands of the Plaintiff are liable to the Creditors, as an Executor of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> wrong, if the Deed of Gift be fraudulent. And fourthly, it may be the Creditors will never ſue for their Debts, and by that means the Defendant will juſtifie the Detainer of the Goods for ever, which would be very inconvenient. But if the Defendant had pleaded a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery by any of the Creditors; and that ſuch Goods to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had been taken in Execution this had been a good Plea. Fifthly, the Defendant is not ſuch a perſon as is inabled by the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to plead the Plea aforeſaid, for the Statute makes the Deed void, as againſt the Creditors, but not againſt the party himſelf, his Executors, or Adminiſtrators, for againſt them it remaines a good Deed of Gift, and this by the opinion of the whole Court.</p>

the Return of the firſt Pannell, and although divers Preſidents were ſhown to the Court, wherein the names of the Jurors <hi>de novo appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit. &amp;c.</hi> were united upon the Pannell, yet the Court did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard them, becauſe it ſeemed that they paſſed in ſilence without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate had upon them, the ſecond cauſe was becauſe it appeared by the Return of the <hi>poſtea,</hi> that the <hi>Tales</hi> were returned by the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, which is error in the firſt Proceſſe to the Coroners, and although in the Entry in the Common Pleas of the Judgement, it is made to be by the Coroners, yet it is not helped in this Caſe, for the warrant of the Roll is the Clerk of the Aſſiſes Certificate, and thus is that, the <hi>Tales</hi> was returned by the Sheriff, and the Court cannot intend it to be otherwiſe then is certified, and thirdly the name of the Juror in the <hi>Tales,</hi> which is, <hi>Gregory</hi> is made in the Entry of the Judgement to be <hi>George,</hi> and although the will ſhall be amended in this point according to the Certificate of the <hi>poſtea,</hi> then in the other point of the Return of the <hi>Tales</hi> by the Sheriff, it is not amendable, and ſo it is error every way, and the Judgement was reverſed by the whole Court.</p>

                        <hi>BRidges,</hi> verſus <hi>Enion Hillar. 9 Jac.</hi> The Plaintiff declares, how <note place="margin">By a Releaſe of all demands money to be paid at a day to come, may be releaſed before the day.</note> that he and the Defendant, <hi>February</hi> tenth <hi>Anno</hi> 7. ſubmitted themſelves to the Award of <hi>S. R. Bodenham,</hi> who awarded they ſhould be friends, and that the Defendant ſhould pay the Plaintiff ten pounds at <hi>Miaſummer</hi> following, at ſuch a place, and the ten pounds being unpaid, the Plaintiff brought his Action, the Defendant pleads in Barr a releaſe made by the Plaintiff to him, of all demands which was made, the tenth of <hi>April,</hi> before <hi>Midſummer,</hi> when the Debt was to be paid, and the releaſe was of all demands, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world, untill the tenth of <hi>April,</hi> and ſhows the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe to the Court, to which the Plaintiff demurres and adjudged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Plaintiff, for although the ſum of Money awarded is not grounded upon any precedent Debt or contract between the parties, yet by the opinion of the Court it lies in demand preſently, and the Plaintiff might aſſign it by his will, and the Executor ſhould have it, and by the ſpirituall Law, Adminiſtration may be granted of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day of payment, if the Plaintif dye before, yet it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable before <hi>Midſummer,</hi> nor will any Action ly for it, but it is a duty preſently by the Award, and as the award is perfect preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſoon as it is pronounced, ſo are all the things contained in the Award, if they be not made payable upon a condition precedent on the part of one of the Parties, as if an award be made, that if the Plaintif ſhall give to the Defendant at <hi>Midſummer</hi> one load of Hay, that then upon the Delivery of the Hay, the Defendant ſhould pay the Plaintif ten pounds, in this caſe the ten pounds cannot be releaſed
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41383:62"/>
before the Day, for it reſts meerly in a poſſibility and contingency, for it becomes a Duty upon the Delivery of the Hay onely, and not before; and therefore it is like the Caſe, 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 42. of a <hi>Nomine pene</hi> waiting upon the Rent, which cannot be releaſed untill the Rent be behinde, for the not paying the Rent makes the <hi>Nomine pene</hi> a Duty; and the Caſe in queſtion is like the Caſe, <hi>Littleton</hi> 117. where a man is bound to pay Money at a Day to come, for a Releaſe of Actions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Day cuts off the Duty, becauſe by 7 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. it is a Duty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and the Caſe is ſtronger here, becauſe the Releaſe is of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; which obſerve.</p>

M.</hi> the Brother of <hi>Arth.</hi> which <hi>Rich.</hi> is now Adminiſtrator, and that he at the time of revoking the Adminiſtration had divers Goods of the Inteſtates in his hands, and ſhews them what they were, to the value of two hundred pounds, and that he after the Adminiſtration revoked, and before no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Suit, had delivered them over to <hi>Rich.</hi> to wit, the 22. of <hi>February, 6. Jacobi,</hi> and that he at the time of the Adminiſtration revoked, had fully adminiſtred all the Goods of the Inteſtates, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Goods delivered to <hi>Rich. &amp;c.</hi> The Plaintiff replied, that the Adminiſtration was revoked by Covin between the Defendant and <hi>Rich.</hi> and upon that they are at Iſſue, and the Jury found it to be Covin, by reaſon whereof the Plaintiff had a Judgement to recover the Debt and Damages of the Goods and Chattels of the ſaid <hi>Arth.</hi> at the time of his Death, being in his hands, to be levied, and upon that Judgement he brought a Writ of Error, and aſſigned for Error, that the Judgement ought to be conditional, to wit, to recover the Debt of the Goods of the Inteſtate, if ſo much remain in his hands, and not abſolutely. But the Judgement was affirmed by the whole Court; for where the Judgement may be final and certain, there it ſhall never be conditional. And becauſe it appears by the Defendants Plea, that he had two hundred pounds in his hands of the Inteſtates Goods, it would be in vain to give Judgement againſt him, if he had ſo much in his hands, ſeeing he himſelf hath confeſſed by his Plea,

                        <hi>DOnghty</hi> verſus <hi>Fawn, Mich. 11. Jacobi.</hi> The Plaintiff declares upon an Obligation of an hundred and twenty pounds, dated 2. <hi>Novemb. 43. Eliz.</hi> And the Condition was, that one <hi>Edw. Astle</hi> by his laſt Will in writing of ſuch a Date, had diſpoſed the Wardſhip of the Defendant, whereof the Defendant was poſſeſſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if therefore the Defendant do ſave and keep harmleſſe the Plaintiff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from all Charges, and Troubles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may happen to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for or by reaſon of the laſt Will of the ſaid <hi>Ed. A.</hi> or from any thing mentioned in that, touching or concerning one <hi>M. Fawn,</hi> or any Legacy or Bequeſt to her given or bequeathed, or otherwiſe from <hi>Ed. A.</hi> to her due, then the Obligation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Defendant pleads that the Plaintiff was not damnified. The Plaintiff replies, that after the Obligation made, one <hi>M. Smith</hi> in the behalf of <hi>Jo.</hi> and <hi>Ed. A.</hi> Sons of the ſaid <hi>Ed. A.</hi> named in the Condition, did exhibite a Bill againſt the Plaintiff, as Adminiſtrator of <hi>A.</hi> in the Chancery, for the payment of the Portions of the ſaid Sons, to which Bill the Plaintiff by way of Anſwer pleaded fully adminiſtred, and for the making good thereof, ſets forth divers payments by him made, and amongſt other payments ſhews that he had payed to <hi>M. Fawn,</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Condition, ſixty pounds for a Legacy due by the Will of the ſaid <hi>Ed. A.</hi> the payment of which ſixty pounds was diſallowed by that Court, and by the Order of the Chancery, ſixty five pounds paid, for not allowing the firſt ſixty pounds to <hi>Ed. A.</hi> the Son, which ſixty and five pounds the Defendant had not repaid, though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto requeſted, and ſo he was damnified; to which Replication the Defendant demurrs; and the opinion of the whole Court after a great Debate, was againſt the Plaintiff, for the Plaintiff in his Replica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had alleadged two Cauſes to inforce his Damage; the firſt was, that the Plaintiff in his Anſwer in the Chancery had alleadged the payment of ſixty pounds to <hi>M. F.</hi> for a Legacy due to her by the Will, and that ſuch Allegation was rejected by the Court, of Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and neither of thoſe matters are certainly alleadged, but by way of Implication, and not expreſly; for he ought to have ſhewn that a Legacy of ſixty pounds was given to <hi>M. F.</hi> by the Will of <hi>E. A.</hi> for although the Will of <hi>E. A.</hi> is recited in the Condition in the Date, againſt which Recitall the Defendant may not be admitted to ſay, that he made no ſuch Will, yet the Legacy given to <hi>M. F.</hi> is not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:41383:63"/>
recited in the Condition, if not in the General, againſt which the Defendant may take a Traverſe, that <hi>Eáw. A.</hi> did not bequeath ſuch a Legacy of ſixty pounds, and upon that a good Iſſue may be taken. And ſecondly, the Plaintiff ſayes, that the payment of the ſaid ſixty pounds was diſallowed by the Court of Chancery, and doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Replication where the Chancery was at that time, to wit, whether at <hi>Westminster,</hi> or at any other place, and it is iſſuable and triable by a Jury, whether any ſuch Order of Chancery were made or not, for the Orders there are but in Paper, and are not upon Record to be tried by Record, but by a Jury: and the Plaintiff perceiving the opinion of the Court againſt him, prayed that he might diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his Suit, which was granted by the whole Court; but <hi>Quaere</hi> of this, it being after a Demurrer.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Action of Debt brought againſt the Sheriff up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Eſcape, for one taken upon a <hi>Capias</hi> upon a Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſance, and adjudged that it would not lie.</note> and declares that one <hi>A.</hi> was bound to the Plaintiff in one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſance of a hundred pounds to be paid at a Day, at which Day <hi>A.</hi> made Default of Payment, and the Plaintiff ſued out two <hi>Scire fac.</hi> and upon the ſecond <hi>Scire fac.</hi> a <hi>Nihil</hi> was returned, and the Plaintiff had Judgement to recover; and afterwards he ſued out a <hi>Levari fac.</hi> and a <hi>Nihil</hi> being returned, the Plaintiff proſecuted a <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciend.</hi> by vertue of which Writ the Defendant being then Sheriff took the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> and afterwards at <hi>D.</hi> in the County of <hi>S.</hi> permitted him to go at large; to which the Declaration the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant demurred. <hi>Damport</hi> for the Defendant, and he ſhewed the cauſe of the Demurrer to be becauſe a <hi>Capias</hi> upon the Recogniſance did not lie; and he divided the Caſe into two parts, firſt whether a <hi>Capias</hi> would lie in the Caſe; and ſecondly, whether the Sheriff would take the Advantage of ſuch a naughty Proceſſe; and as to the firſt it ſeemed to him that a <hi>Capias</hi> would not lie, becauſe it appeared by <hi>Herberts 5. Repub. fol.</hi> 12. And <hi>Garnons</hi> Caſe 5. <hi>Rep. fol.</hi> 88. that the Body of the Defendant was not liable to Execution for Debt, by the Common Law, but onely in Treſpaſſe, where a Fine was due to the King, or that he was accountant to the King: and the Plaintiff could have no other Proceſſe but a <hi>Fieri facias</hi> within the year, and if the year were paſſed, then he might have a new Original in Debt. But now by the Statute of <hi>Marlbrig, cap.</hi> 23. And <hi>Westm. 2. cap.</hi> 11. a <hi>Capias</hi> is given in Account, and by the 25 <hi>E. 3. c. 17. Capias</hi> is given in Debt and Detinue, and by the 19 <hi>H. 7. c.</hi> 9. the like Proceſſe is given in Caſe, as in Debt and Treſpaſſe, and the 23 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 14. a <hi>Capias</hi> is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a Writ of Annuity and Covenant, but Statute gives a <hi>Capias</hi> in this Caſe, and therefore it remaines as it was at Common, and by that it would not lie, which is alſo apparent by the Recogniſance, for
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41383:63"/>
that is, that if the Debt ſhall be levied of the Goods and Chattels, Lands and Tenements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and doth not meddle with the Body, and by an expreſſe Authority, 13 <hi>&amp; 14 Eliz. Dier, 306. Puttenhams</hi> Caſe it is held that the Chancery hath no Authority to commit the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> upon a Recovery in a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> upon a Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, becauſe the Body is not liable. And for the ſecond point, it ſeemed to him, that the Sheriff ſhould take Advantage of this, which ſhould be as void and as null, whereof a ſtranger may take benefit, and to prove this he took this Difference, when a Proceſſe will not lie, and where it is diſorderly awarded, as if an <hi>Exigent</hi> be ſued out before a <hi>Capias,</hi> or an Execution before Judgement; for if that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe be originally ſuppoſed, there the Proceſſe is but erroneous, in <hi>Druries</hi> Caſe, 8. <hi>Rep. 142. 34 H. 6. 2. b.</hi> But if the Action it ſelf will not maintain the Proceſſe as a <hi>Capias in Formedon,</hi> there that Proceſſe is as void and null: and he took another Diverſity, when the <hi>Capias</hi> is taken by the Award of the Court, when Judgement is given that he ſhall recover; for in that Caſe it ſhall remain good, untill it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, becauſe it is the Act of the Court; and ſo is <hi>Druries</hi> Caſe to be intended: but if the party himſelf take it, it is at his own peril, as here it is; for the Plaintiff hath onely pleaded, that he proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is as void to the party who ſued it out, and he ſhall have no benefit of it; but the Sheriff ſhall not be puniſhed for falſe Impriſonment, becauſe he is not to examine the illegality or validity of the Proceſſe; for the 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 36. If a <hi>Capias</hi> iſſue out without any Original: and the party be taken, the Sheriff ſhall not be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed; and for theſe Reaſons he prayed Judgement for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant: <hi>Noy</hi> was for the Plaintiff, and he agreed, that at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law no Action did lie in this Caſe, as it hath been ſaid; but he was of opinion, that this Caſe is within 25 <hi>E. 3. cap.</hi> 17. for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and drift of the Statute was to give ſpeedy remedy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Debts, and the Action is all one in the eye of the Law, as if it had been done by Original, which in the equity of the Statute. And a <hi>Capias</hi> lies upon a Recogniſance againſt a Surety for the Peace, and upon a <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt the Bail in the Upper Bench. As to <hi>Puttenhams</hi> Caſe, the Reaſon, becauſe he was not in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before. And for the ſecond Objection, although the <hi>Capias</hi> did not lie, yet it is but Error; for if the Court had Juriſdiction to hold plea of the Cauſe, although the Proceſs be naughtily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, it is but Error, of which the Sheriff ſhall not take benefit; and therefore if a Woman have recovered in Dower, and hath Damages in the Common Pleas, and thereupon the party takes a <hi>Capias</hi> for the Damages, and the party be taken, and ſuffered to go at large, it is an Eſcape, 10 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. 23. and if a <hi>Capias</hi> be awarded in the Common Pleas, after the Record removed, it is
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:41383:64"/>
but Error, and ſo ruled, 13 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Title Barr, 253. But if the Court hath no Jurisdiction in the cauſe, as a <hi>Formedon</hi> brought in the upper Bench, as it is 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. 4. or an Appeal in the Common Pleas, or where a Writ is awarded out of the Chancery, returna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in <hi>Cheſter,</hi> theſe are void, and <hi>coram non Judice,</hi> and there ought not to be any arreſt upon ſuch a Writ, and he cited a Caſe, <hi>Trin.</hi> 31. and 37. <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Exchequer, <hi>Woodhouſe</hi> and <hi>Ognells</hi> Caſe, ruled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingy, and as concerning the difference taken, there is no other form of pleading, but only, <hi>quod proſecutus fuit quoddam, &amp;c.</hi> without ſaying, that it was by the award of the Court, and the Court at that time did ſtrongly incline, that it was but Error at the moſt, but <hi>Mich. 11 Ja.</hi> It was adjudged by the whole Court, that the <hi>Capias</hi> could not ly, and that it was onely Error, of which the Sheriffe ſhall not take the benefit.</p>

A Leaſe to two, and the longeſt Liver of them, and the 17 <hi>E. 3. 7.

And a Difference is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken between a time certain in which a thing is to be done, and a time incertain; for in the Caſe of Rent reſerved at a Day certain, Demand thereof muſt be made upon the Land onely, becauſe the Land is the Debtor; for <hi>Popham</hi> ſaid, that if the Leſſor ſhould come and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Rent, and there ſhould meet with <hi>J. S.</hi> a ſtranger, and ſhould ſay to <hi>J. S.</hi> Pay me my Rent, this is no good Demand of the Rent, having miſtaken the perſon who is chargeable with it: but in this Caſe one general Demand of Rent, without reference to any perſon who is not chargeable, is good. And he was of opinion, that if a man leaſe Land, rendring Rent for a year, whenſoever the Leſſor ſhould demand it, in this Caſe the Leſſor come and demand it before the end of the year, his Demand upon the Land is not good, except <note place="margin">When a demand ſhall be made to the perſon, and when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> the Leſſee be there alſo; for the time being incertain, when the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor will demand it, he ought to give notice to the Leſſee of it. And if the Leſſor come to the Leſſee in perſon, and demands the Rent, yet it is not ſufficient; for although notice is to be given the Leſſee in perſon,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:41383:72"/>
yet the Land is the Debtor, and therefore the Law ties the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee to the Land, as to the place in which he ſhall be paid; but if the Leſſor ſtay nntill the eud of the year, then the Leſſee at his peril ought to attend upon the Land to pay it, for the end of the year is time of payment preſcribed by the Law which was granted, and Judgement was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

For firſt it was held not to be any Joynture within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. for it is not any ſuch gift as is intended by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, for the Biſhop was not any Anceſtor of the Husband, and the Husband took nothing by that, but it was a voluntary recompence given by the Biſhop in reward of the ſervice paſſed. And the Statute intended a valuable confideration. And alſo the Biſhop might well intend it for the Advancement of the woman, who appeared to be Cozen to the Biſhop.

But <hi>quaere</hi> of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, for the other Judges did not allow it.

Thirdly, although upon view of the Deed made by the Biſhop the Land which by the Declaration is layed to be in <hi>Sutton Cofeild,</hi> by the Deed appears to be in <hi>Little Sutton,</hi> yet this is helped by the Verdict, by which it is found expreſly that the Biſhop gave the Lands within written, and therefore being ſo preciſely found the Deed is not materiall.

And the Demand ought to be made at the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Sun the laſt inſtant of that day, and when he made his Demand, he ought to ſtand ſtill, and not walk up and down, for the Law did not allow of walking Demands.

And becauſe thoſe whom the Dean and Chapter did ſend to make the demand of Rent ſaid, bear witneſſe, we are come hither to demand and receive ſuch Rent, it was held by the Court, that ſuch a demand was not good. And they held the demand ought to be made at that part of the Church where the greateſt and moſt common going in is. And in this caſe it was ſaid by <hi>Popham,</hi> that if a man make a Leaſe to one for yeers to commence at a day to come, and then he leaſe to another for yeers rendring Rent upon a condition to commence preſently.

Houſes in the name of all. And the other Meſſuages were in Leaſe for yeers, and the Leſſees did not atturn. And the queſtion was if the Meſſuages paſſed by the bargain and ſale, or by the livery. And it was adjudged that they paſſed by the bargain and ſale. And <hi>Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton</hi> took a difference between ſeverall Conveyances both of them Executory, and where one of them is executed preſently, as in Sir <hi>Rowland Heywoods</hi> Caſe, where divers Lands were given, granted, leaſed, bargained, and ſold to divers for yeers; the Leſſees were at election whether they would take by the bargain and ſale upon the Statute of 27 <hi>H</hi> 8. or by the demiſe at the Common Law. But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is if one be executed at firſt, for then the other comes too late, as it is in this Caſe; for by the very delivery of the bargains and ſale, the Land by the cuſtome of <hi>London</hi> paſſes without inrollment, for <hi>London</hi> is excepted, and this cuſtome was found by the Verdict. And therefore it being executed, and the Conveyance being made perfect by the delivery of the Deed without any other circumſtances, the livery of ſeſin comes too late, for it is made to him that had the Inheritance of the Meſſuage at that time. And the poſſeſſion executed hinders the poſſeſſion executory, for if a bargain and ſale be made of Land, and before inrollment the bargain takes a deed of the ſaid Land, this hinders the inrollment, becauſe the taking of the livery did deſtroy the uſe which paſſed by the bargain and ſale which was granted by the Court. And another reaſon was given, becauſe it appeared that the intent of the parties was to have the Land paſſe by the bargain and ſale; becauſe it was to make a perfect Tenant to the <hi>Precipe,</hi> as appears by the ſubſequent acts, as the Indentures Covenant, and the bringing the Writ of Right <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which will be made fruſtrate, if the livery of ſeiſin ſhall be effectuall: and when an Act is indifferent, it ſhall be taken moſt neer to the parties intents that may be if a man hath a Mannor, to which an advowſon is appendant, and makes a Deed of the Mannor with the appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; And delivers the Deed, but doth not make livery of ſeiſin, yet now although the Deed in it ſelf was ſufficient to paſſe the <hi>Advowſon,</hi> yet becauſe the party did not intend to paſſe it in <hi>Poſſe,</hi> but as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenant if the Mannor will not paſſe, no more ſhall the Advowſon paſſe alone, as it was agreed, 14 <hi>Eliz:</hi> in <hi>Andrews</hi> Caſe.

The Grandfather and Father dye, the Son who is Plaintiffe was admitted, and enters upon the Land: <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery</hi> being then in poſſeſſion, and the Defendant then living with her as a ſervant in thoſe Tenements, and this was the ſpeciall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, And Judgment was given for the Plaintiffe. And the Court was of an opinion, that the Defendant was found to be a ſufficient Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſſor, and Ejector, though he be but a Servant to the pretended owner of the Land, becauſe the Verdict found that the Defendant did there dwell with <hi>Margery.</hi> And in ſuch caſe he had the true title and had made his entry, might well bring his Action againſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter or Servant at his election. And perhaps the Maſter might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelf that he could not be arreſted. And ſecondly, it was adjudged, that the ſurrender of <hi>J.

And <hi>Yelverton</hi> Juſtice having asked the opinions of all the Judges in <hi>Serjeants Inne Fleetſtreet,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their opinions in the Court, the Record of <hi>Niſi prius</hi> was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Exchequer, to wit, that it was in the diſcretion of the Juſtices of Aſſize to accept ſuch a Plea as is before, and that it might

And that the Court of Exchequer where the Record was, would not award the <hi>Venire Facias</hi> of all the three Villages named in the Record, if it did not appear judicially to them that the Cloſe did extend in all the Villages; and it doth not appear for parcell, if the premiſes doth not neceſſarily extend to all the Villages, but may well be, and ſo preſumed in one Village onely, and therefore it is matter of ſubſtance.

                     <p>And as to the Exception to the <hi>Venire facias</hi> the Roll is right, which warrants the Writ, and therefore they held it was but the Writers fault, and ſhould be amended: and <hi>Doddridge</hi> and <hi>Cook</hi> held the Triall good: if Infancy be alledged, the Triall ſhall be by inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction during his Nonage, as it is 17 <hi>E.</hi> 3.

for if the Action be reall, it ſhall be tried where the Land lies, as it is 21 <hi>E. 3. 28. 28 E. 3. 17. 44 Aſſiſ. 10. 46 E. 3. 7. 13 H.</hi> 4. 3. and if both places be in one County, then the <hi>venire facias</hi> ſhall be of both, 22 <hi>E. 3. 11.

all the time of the year. And when the Fields were ſowen, they uſed to have Common, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it was held by <hi>Nicholls</hi> that for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Appendant it is not neceſſary to preſcribe, but to ſay he is ſeiſed of one Meſſuage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Fee; and that he hath Common of Paſture in the ſaid place, as belonging and appertaining to the Tenement. And ſaies further, that Judgment ought to be given for the Plaintiffe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it appeared by the Record, that the Defendant took the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at ſuch time as the Plaintiffe ought to have Common. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Nicholls</hi> ſaid, that if a man have Common for great Cattell and Sheep, and the Sheep be taken, and he preſcribes that he hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for Sheep only; and the Jury ſaid Common for Sheep and great Cattel, the Common is found for the Plaintiffe. And the like if one claim Common all the time of the year, when the Land lyes fallow, and when it is ſowen, from ſuch a day unto, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And his Cattel are taken in the year when it is ſowen as lies fallow, it is ſufficient for the Plaintiffe to preſcribe for Common, either in the year when it is ſowen, or when it lies fallow. And if the Jury find all the Common, it is ſufficiently found for the Plaintiffe. The like if a man hath Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon from ſuch a day to ſuch day, and the Cattell are taken, and a day between the dayes, and he preſcribes that he hath Common in the ſaid time, <hi>quo, &amp;c</hi> And the Jury find he had Common before that time the ſame day, and after the Verdict is found for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe, and <hi>Warburton</hi> and <hi>Winch</hi> of the ſame opinion.</p>

The Plaintiffe pleaded in Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that he was ſeiſed of a Cloſe adjoyning to the place, in which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and put therein his Cattell, and that they eſcaped by fault of incloſure, and iſſue taken
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:41383:93"/>
upon that. And after a Verdict by default thoſe exceptions were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Avowry in Arreſt of Judgement. Firſt, becauſe it appeared by the Advowry that the Copiholder had ſurrendred a Reverſion, which could not be, becauſe a Copiholder is a Tenant at will, and ſo could not have a reverſion; for he cannot make a Leaſe for yeers without the licenſe of the Lord, but this exception was over-ruled by the Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t. Secondly, becauſe there was no Atturnment alledged in the firſt ſurrender. And it was held no exception, becauſe the Rent for which he avowed was reſerved by the Copiholder by the ſecond ſurrender, to which the Termer had atturned. And alſo the Court ſaid, that an Atturnment is not neceſſary for a Copiholder, becauſe there is no time when the Terme ſhould atturn. For before the ſurrender he cannot atturn; and after the ſurrender and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it is too late. And the Copihold eſtate is like an eſtate raiſed by uſes or deviſe, in which an Atturnment is not neceſſary. As alſo in an eſtate raiſed by Fine, and the like, an Atturnment is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for if the Termer will not atturn, he is compellable by Law, as by a <hi>Quid juris clamat:</hi> but a Copiholder hath no means to make the Termer atturn if he refuſe. And thirdly in the concluſion of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowry, he doth not ſay that the Rent was behind ſuch a day, and one and twenty dayes after at leaſt; and this exception was diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, becauſe the diſtreſſe is a ſufficient demand of the Rent; and it appears that the day of the taking of the diſtreſſe was one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dayes after the Feaſt, at which the Rent was due, and Judgment was given for the Advowant: and note, that a Covenant to diſtrain is idle, for a man may diſtrain of common right.</p>

And in arreſt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:41383:96"/>
of Judgment it was objected, that in effect there was no iſſue joyned. For the traverſe of the ſeſin of <hi>Ellen E.</hi> was idle, for no title of the Rent is derived from her, but they ought to have traverſed the ſeiſin of <hi>Thomas</hi> the grantor, and then the Iſſue had been of ſuch a nature, that it had made an end of the matter in queſtion, which was not in this caſe, no more then if the Tenant in Formulen ſhould plead not guilty, but the Court held that though an apter iſſue might have been taken, and that the traverſe is not good, yet it was helped by the ſtatute of <hi>Jeofailes.</hi> For the eſtate of <hi>Ellen H.</hi> was in a ſort by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance materiall. For if ſhe were ſeiſed in tayl, and that eſtate tayl, diſcended to <hi>Thomas</hi> the grantor, then by his death the Rent is determined after the Fee diſcended to <hi>Tho:</hi> from <hi>Ellen,</hi> there the eſtate was of that nature, that he might grant a ſufficient rent charge. And although it might well be preſumed, that <hi>Thomas</hi> after the Fee diſcended to him from <hi>Ellen</hi> had altred ſuch eſtate tayl, yet by <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pham</hi> the Courts ſhal not now intend that, becauſe the parties doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing, but whether <hi>Ellen</hi> was ſeiſed in Fee or not when he dyed, And that doubt is reſolved by the Verdict, as if a Defendant ſhould plead a D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Finch,</hi> granted a Rent charge to <hi>H.</hi> iſſuing out of her Mannor of <hi>N.</hi> and out of all her Lands in <hi>D.

Finch</hi> into the Lands in <hi>D.</hi> And upon the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant demurrs for the Lands in <hi>D.</hi> were not belonging or appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Mannor of <hi>N.</hi> and adjudged for the Defendant. For no Land can be charged by that grant, if it be not belonging to the Mannor. And that for two Reaſons, the firſt is becauſe by the word <hi>(aut alibi)</hi> it appears that it is all but one ſentence, and the <hi>(Aut)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynes the words proceeding to wit, all the Lands in <hi>D. S.</hi> and to put in the County of <hi>Kent</hi> in theſe words following, to wit <hi>(alibi)</hi> in the ſaid County to the ſaid Mannor appertaining, and the ſentence is not perfect untill you come to the laſt words, (to the ſaid. Mannor appertaining) for if the Rent be iſſuing out of the Land in <hi>D. &amp;c.</hi>
                        <pb n="185" facs="tcp:41383:96"/>
which is not appertaining to the Mannor, then the ſentence muſt be perfect, and theſe words <hi>(County of Kent,</hi> and theſe <hi>(aut alibi)</hi> muſt begin a new ſentence: which was never ſeen, that they ſhould make the beginning of a ſentence. And therefore this caſe is not like the caſe between <hi>Bacon</hi> and <hi>Baker,</hi> ſecond of King <hi>James,</hi> in the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> grants all her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The ſecond reaſon was, in reſpect of the nature of the thing granted, which was but a rent. And therefore, if rent be granted out of a Mannor, to be perceived, and taken out of one acre, this ſhall be good: and nothing ſhall be charged but that one acre only, 17. <hi>Aſſ.</hi> but otherwiſe it is of Land for a Feofment of a Mannor. To have <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one acre it is a void <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend.</hi> For here it appears, that the intent of the Lady <hi>Finch</hi> was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to charge the Mannor, and ſuch Land only which were appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Mannor: But <hi>Popham</hi> held the contrary, for he conceived that <hi>D. S.</hi> and <hi>W.</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent</hi> were particularly named and bounded in by the name of the place and County, and therefore they ſhould be charged, although they were not appertaining to the Mannor. As if a man grants all his Lands in <hi>D. R.</hi> and <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>.</hi> in the County of <hi>M.</hi> and in <hi>Darn</hi> in the ſame County which he hath by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, it ſhould only extend to <hi>Darn,</hi> but denyed by the Court, but he was ſtrongly of that opinion. And he held that by the firſt of the charge out of the Mannor; all the Lands parcell or appertaining to the Mannor are charged, and therefore the ſubſequent words if they ſhould be limited, as is above-ſaid, would be idle and frivolous. And <hi>Yelverton</hi> ſaid, that the words before belonging or appertaining, ſhall be taken to extend to the Land occupied in the Mannor, although it is not parcell of it, and <hi>Fenwood</hi> and <hi>Willams</hi> granted, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given that the Defendant ſhould have a return <hi>habend.</hi>

Jacob.</hi> In a <hi>replevin</hi> in which <hi>Pallet</hi> was Plaintiff, the caſe was ſuch, where a man made a Leaſe of Lands, of which Land he was ſeized by a good Title, and of Land of which he was ſeiſed of a defeaſible Title for years, rendring rent: and in the <hi>replevin,</hi> the Leſſor avows for the whole rent: The Plaintiff in the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plevin</hi> ſaith; that after the leaſe made, the Diſſeiſee had entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on part of the Land, and a demurrer. Sergeant <hi>Hicham</hi> moved for the Advowant that he ought to have a return; for he agreed that the rent ſhould have been apportioned; but he ſaid, that if a man avows for many things, and he hath right but to one, he ſhall have a returh <hi>habend. 5. H.</hi> 7. and 9. <hi>H.</hi> 7. And 4. <hi>Aſſ.

If a man in an action of debt demands more then hee ought, yet upon a <hi>nil debet</hi> pleaded, the Leſſor ſhall recover ſo much as ſhall be apportioned and aſſeſſed by the Jury, and shall be barred as to the reſidue. But <hi>Yelverton</hi> was of another opinion; for he ſaid, as this caſe is, the Avowant shall not have a return <hi>habend.</hi> But if the apporciament had been made by the Jury, he should have had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn <hi>habend.</hi> but in this caſe the apporciament muſt be made by the Judges, to whom the quantity of the Land cannot appear, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot make apportiament; for they all agreed that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portiament ought to be accotding to the value of the Land, and not according to the quantity: And to prove this, he cited <hi>Hubberd</hi> and <hi>Hammonds</hi> Caſe, 43. <hi>Eliz. co. lib.</hi> 427. As where the Fines of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyholders upon admittance are uncertain, the Lord cannot exact ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Fines: and if the Copyholder deny to pay it, it shall be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the opinion of the Judges before whom the matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends: and upon a demurrer to the evidence to a Jury upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion

And <hi>Popham</hi> is of the ſame opinion; for he ſaid the value of the Land ought to be ſhewed by the Leſſee, for every one ought to plead that which is in his knowledg, and that was in the Leſſee's knowledg, and not the Leſſor: and <hi>Fenner</hi> of the ſame opinion, but <hi>Yelverton</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi> againſt it; for <hi>Yelverton</hi> ſaid, that it appeared that part of the Land was evicted, and therefore it ought to be apportioned; but becauſe the value did not appear to the Judges, it could not be apportioned. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid, that if the Leſſee ſurrender part, the Leſſor need not ſhew the value: and <hi>Popham</hi> agreed to that, becauſe the acceptions of the Leſſor had made him privy to it.</p>

But the Court ſaid, that the matter of taking the Cattell did not come into queſtion; for nothing was in iſſue but the cuſtome, which is found againſt the Plaintiff; for if the Plaintiff would have taken advantage of that, he ought to have demurred. And although by that he had confeſſed the cuſtom, yet whether ſuch Commoner could have taken, the Lords Cattell would then properly have come into debate. And by <hi>Fenner, Williams,</hi> and <hi>Cook,</hi> the taking the Lords Cattel damage feſant was good; for by the cuſtom the Lord is to be excluded but only for his ſtint: and the Lord may well be

ſtinted, and the whole veſtive and benefit of the ſoile is the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and they have no other remedy to preſerve the benefit they have in feeding their Cattell, but by taking the Cattell of the Lord if he offends.

An Action of Treſpaſs and Battery was brought the laſt day of <hi>October, 10 Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobi:</hi> The Defendant as to the force and armes ſayes nothing, but pleads generally that he and one, in the ſayd laſt day of <hi>October</hi> did joyntly enter into the Plaintiffs at <hi>S.</hi> and did then and there aſſault the Plaintiff; and that afterwards, to wit, ſuch a day and yeare, the ſaid Plaintiff<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did by his Writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> releaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſaid <hi>R.</hi> of all Actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And avers it to be the ſame Treſpaſs whereof the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff complained, and the Plaintiff traverſes without this, that the Treſpaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was joyntly done, and demurrer upon this Plea, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending

the Treſpaſs is ſeverall and not joynt, and ſo no ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but it was held a good Plea, for the Battery was joynt or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall at the Plaintiffs election, to have his Action againſt one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And a ſatisfaction by one is a ſatisfaction for all, and the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff cannot have ſeverall dammages, but one dammage againſt them all, and he hath his choice, as in <hi>Heydens</hi> Caſe, to have the beſt dammages.</p>

If a ſtranger come and eat up my Common, a Free-holder may bring an Aſſize of common, for it is a Diſſeiſin; for a Diſſeiſin of Common; is the taking away the profits of the Common: And an action of caſe will lye againſt the Lord for cutting down the body of the tree, when the Tenant ſhould have the loppings; if the Commoner may have his Common, although another take away part of my Common, yet no action lyeth. As if one beat my ſervant lightly, except the Maſter loſe his ſervice, no action lieth.

Sheriffs turn, it ought to be holden before the Sheriff, as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription it ought to be ſhewed, before whom the turn was held, or elſe it would be naught.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:41383:106"/>
and moved in Arreſt of Judgment that the venu was miſtaken, becauſe it was of <hi>Wapenbury</hi> only, and not of <hi>Elthorp,</hi> and they of <hi>W.</hi> could not try a matter in <hi>E.</hi> And although it was anſwered, that the Defendant himſelf by his plea had confeſsed that <hi>E.</hi> was but an Hamlet, yet the Court held the <hi>venu</hi> miſtaken; for when the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tif declares of a Treſpaſs in <hi>E.</hi> This by generall intendment is preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be a Village: of which Village the matter which is there in queſtion ought to be tryed: and although the Defendant had alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <hi>Elthorp</hi> to be but an Hamlet; yet it was but to inable the deviſe, and doth not extend to the iſsue before joyned upon the not guilty for part; for in that iſsue both parties agree that <hi>Elthorp</hi> is a Village, and it is a perfect iſsue taken, which hath not any coherence with the other iſsue of <hi>non deviſavit:</hi> but if the Defendant had to the whole iſſue pleaded the deviſe as his excuſe, and had alledged <hi>E.</hi> to be an Hamlet of <hi>W.</hi> and that only been in iſſue there, the <hi>venu</hi> awarded had been good of <hi>W.</hi> only; but in this caſe it was adjudged that the <hi>veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> was miſ-awarded, and that the Plaintif ſhould have a <hi>venire facias de novo.</hi>

A Juſtice of Peace cannot command his ſervant to arreſt one without a Warrant in <note place="margin">Juſt. of Peace cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to arreſt in his abſence without war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</note> writing in his abſence. And <hi>Popham,</hi> chiefe Juſtice, ſaid, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Judges knew the Authority of the Maior, by which they arreſted men; yet becauſe it did not appear to them judicially as Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, it muſt be pleaded: And a Juſtice of Peace cannot command his ſervant to arreſt one if not in his preſence, which was granted. And <hi>Fennor,</hi> Juſtice, ſaid, that the ſervant is not an Officer to the Maior as he is a Juſtice of Peace, but the Conſtable: and <hi>Walker</hi> alſo added, that the Plea was, that the Maior commanded to impriſon him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently without ſhewing any cauſe, which was held naught; for the maior ought to temper his Authority according to Law. For the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges cannot impriſon without ſhewing cauſe; but them and the Maior both may command an Officer to arreſt a man without ſhewing the cauſe, for elſe before he ſhall be examined he may invent and frame an excuſe, and the acceſsories will flye away: And <hi>Williams,</hi> Juſtice, finds that it was incertain for the Plaintif, by what authority he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it, whether as Maior or Juſtice of Peace: and his power as a Juſtice of Peace the Judges knew by common Law; but his power as a Maior they knew not, if it be not ſhewed by pleading and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

And if the limitation had been to the Heirs of the body of the woman by her Husband, and by <hi>I.

                        <hi>HOrn</hi> againſt <hi>Widlake, Mich. 6. Jac.</hi> An action of Treſpaſs brought wherefore he broke his Cloſe, and ſpoiled his Graſs in <hi>D.</hi> The Defendant pleads, that in the Cloſe wherein the Plaintiff ſuppoſes the Treſpaſs to be done time out of mind, there hath been a foot-way for all people paſſing in, by, and through the ſaid Cloſe untill ſuch a day, <note place="margin">Nota.</note> and that ſuch a day the Plaintiff plowed up the ſaid Foot-way, and ſowed it with Corn, and laid thorns on the ſides of it: And further pleads, that in the ſaid Cloſe, neer the ſaid ancient Foot-way, the Plaintiff, before the Treſpaſs ſuppoſed to be committed, left, and ſet out another Foot-way for all people who would uſe that new way; which way, ſince it was laid forth, hath been uſed by all Foot-paſsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; by reaſon whereof, the Defendant the time in which, &amp;c. went in the way ſo laid forth unto ſuch a place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is the ſame treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

As if there were a Foot-way through the Cloſe of <hi>I. S.</hi> over an hedg, and I ſhould remove the hedg into a new place, if paſsengers in uſing their way goe over the hedg where it is newly placed and fixed, they ſhall not be puniſhed for that; for it ariſes of the Act and wrong of the Plaintiff himſelfe: and <hi>volenti non fit injuria:</hi> As if water run by the Land of <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> ſtop the water-courſe, ſo that it ſurround my ground; if now abate this, hee ſhall not have an action againſt me for entring into his Cloſe, becauſe the ſtoppage was his own Act, and the ſame law in the principall caſe. And although the Defendant hath pleaded generally, that the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:41383:110"/>
Plaintiff hath ſet out a way, and ſhews not where it is, is not materiall; for that which is common to all cannot be aſſigned to any particular perſon, which was the opinion of the whole Court, except Juſtice <hi>Yelverton.</hi>

T.</hi> And that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant as ſervant, and by his commandement, hath entred, and put in his Cattell. The Plaintiff replyed, that true it was, that the Free-hold was in Sir <hi>John T.</hi> But ſaid, that a long time before the Treſpaſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> leaſed the Cloſe to the Plaintiff at will, by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he entred, and was poſſeſſed untill the Defendant did the Treſpaſs, and traverſes without that, that the Defendant by the command of Sir <hi>Io.</hi> entred, and put in his Cattell; and the Defendant demurred, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged againſt the Plaintiff, for the plea in Barre is good, and in no wiſe avoided by the Replication; for the Replication muſt be good only by way of Title: And the Plaintiff doth not intitle himſelfe to any good Leaſe at will; for he doth not alledg indeed any Seiſin in Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> or any poſſeſſion in him, out of which a Leaſe at will may be derived. And although a Declaration may be good to a common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and in debt upon a Leaſe, as 21. <hi>H.</hi> 7. is, the Plaintiff may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that he deviſed. And need not alledg a ſeiſin in himſelf, when he made the Leaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet when a title is made by Barre or Replication, as 2 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 9. is, that ought to be certain to all intents, becauſe it is tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſable, and becauſe the Defendant had made a good Juſtification in Law, that ought to be anſwered by the Plaintiff with a good title, to wit, that Sir <hi>I. T.</hi> was ſeiſed, and made a Leaſe to him at will, which is not ſo done; but it is all one, as if he should have replyed, that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin-Hood</hi> in <hi>Barnwood</hi> ſtood, without that by the command of Sir <hi>Iohn,</hi> &amp;c. which obſerve.

And if it ſeemed to the Court that it was not held in manner and form, they found for the Plaintiff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And adjudged for the Defendant, for although the verdict did not agree with the plea in manner and form of the tenure, yet it agreed in ſubſtance in the point, for which the taking was, to wit, that the Land was holden of the Earl, and that ſuffices; for there is difference between a Replevin and Treſpaſs: For in Replevin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> and <hi>Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs.</hi>

And the Plaintiff is not bound to prove the property in any of the Caſes: and the reaſon is, becauſe the Writ commands only the value to be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of, and no more, and that only is the charge of the Jury: And the whole Court were of opinion, that they themſelves as Judges, if
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41383:111"/>
they would in ſuch Caſe might aſſeſſe Damages without any Writ, if they would trouble themſelves, for the Writ goes onely, becauſe it is known what Damages are, but it is otherwiſe, when not guilty is pleaded, for then the Treſpaſſe is denyed, which muſt be proved and tryed by the Jury, and there both the value and property come in proof; and obſerve, the Judgement is, that he ſhould recover, and if upon a Writ of inquiry he ſhould be bound to prove the property, and fail thereof, it would be in deſtruction of the firſt Judgement which cannot <hi>b.</hi> obſerve this.</p>

The Defendant pleads that <hi>Ch.</hi> hath not granted the Mannor of <hi>E.</hi> to <hi>Remingham,</hi> paying the rent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in manner and form, and the Plaintiff demurres upon this Plea: And it was argued that the Bar was good, which is a direct traverſe to the title of the Plaintiff, to deſtroy the ground of the Plaintiffs action; for if no rent were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, then the Indenture concerning which the Plaintif complains, did not belong to the Plaintiff; for it paſſes not to the Plaintiff, but as an incident to the ſecond Grant, of neceſſity to make good his title: As the Lord <hi>Buckhurſts</hi> Caſe, <hi>Co. 1. &amp; 7. E.</hi> 4. 30. in aſſize of rent, the Plaintiff made his title by deed of a rent charge, it was a good plea to ſay that nothing paſſed by the grant, becauſe the iſſue is taken upon the ſpeciall matter, and not the generall; but in an Aſſize brought of an Office, it is no plea to ſay there is no ſuch Office, for that amounts to no more but that he hath not diſſeiſed him, 45. <hi>E.</hi> 3. In treſpaſs
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:41383:115"/>
for taking away of writing, it is no plea to ſay that he never had ſuch a writing, but muſt plead not guilty: So in an Action of Treſpaſs for Goods, it is no Plea to ſay, that the property of them was to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtranger, and not to the Plaintif, becauſe by that plea hee denies not but that the Plaintif was in poſaeſſion, which is ſufficient to maintain the Action, 20. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 28. which books prove that the Plea in Bar is not good, for the Defendant deſtroys the Plaintifs Action, but by way of Argument: And the rent by ſuch Action is not demanded, but da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages for tearing the Indenture, and ſo the Title of Rent is not in queſtion, and exceptions were taken to the Declaration. Firſt, the Action was brought for tearing the Counter-part, by which the Rent was not created: And the Indenture is not expreſly granted to the Plaintif, but the rent of 60 l. only is bargained and ſold; and by that the counter-part that pertains to <hi>Remingham,</hi> doth not paſs to the Plaintif as an incident; for it is not the Originall Deed by which at firſt the rent was reſerved, which was granted by all but the Cheife Juſtice, for he ſaid that the counter-part waited upon the intereſt, and was good evidence for that: Secondly, the Plaintif had not aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that <hi>Ch.</hi> for whoſe life the Rent was granted, was alive at the time of tearing the Indenture; and if <hi>C.</hi> was dead, the Indenture pertained to the Defendant of right, as Heir of <hi>Ch.</hi> for ſo much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by the Plaintifs own ſhewing, which was granted. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Plaintiff ſhewed not that ever hee was poſaeſsed of the Deed but by way of Argument, to wit, that he caſually loſt it, which is not ſufficient; for none ſhall have treſpaſs but he who is in actuall poſaeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was alſo granted by the Court. Fourhly, the counter-part whereof the Plaintif complains, by the Plaintifs own ſhewing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as well a warranty as the rent reſerved: And therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſpecial gift made of that Deed by <hi>Ch.</hi> to the Plaintiff, that Deed doth not paſs by Law to the Plaintiff, as it is adjudged in Lord <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſts</hi> Caſe. Fifthly, if <hi>Ch.</hi> the Father be dead, then the writing hath loſt his force, as to the rent; for by his death the rent is determined, and therefore of neceſſity the Plaintiff ought to averre the life of <hi>Ch.</hi> For no Action lies for a Deed that is determined, and for theſe reaſons the Plaintiff did diſcontinue his Action.</p>

If Tenant for life levy a Fine having Land in the ſame Villiage, this ſhall not bind the Leſsor, if five yeares paſs before he take notice of what Land the Fine is levied: And the ſame Law if Tenant for life make a Feofment to one who hath land within the ſame Village levies a Fine, and in this cafe if the Leſsee hath continually payd all his Rent, the Leſsor cannot intend or ſuſpect, but that the Leſsee is abſolute Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the whole: and in <hi>Farmers</hi> Caſe it is ſayd, That if the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor levy a Fine, the Diſseiſee is barred without claime, for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but he to whom the wrong is done ſhall preſently know it. But if he that hath the particular eſtate by Grant or truſt repoſed in him, ſhall ſecretly practice, although he pay the Rent and continue poſaeſſion, yet it is otherwiſe: But the Reporters opinion was, that if in the principall caſe no Rent had been reſerved, then the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had been deveſted by the entry, for there had been no act done to miſlead or hinder the knowledge thereof; and alſo although rent

An Action of Aſſault and Battery brought, and there was a Demurrer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Evidence: And the caſe was, that the Defendant the day ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the Declaration ſaid, that the Plaintiff aſſaulted the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, and in defence of himſelfe juſtifies the beating; the Plaintiff re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that he did it of his own wrong, without any ſuch cauſe: and in the Evidence the Defendant maintained that the Plaintiff beate him the day mentioned in the Declaration, and in the ſame place. And the Plaintiff perceiving that, gave in evidence that the Battery was made another day and place, to wit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was the cauſe of the ſpeciall verdict; for if there be two Batteries made between the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff and Defendant at divers times, the Plaintiff is bound to prove the Battery made the ſame day in his Declaration, and ſhall not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to give another day in evidence, by the opinion of the whole Court.</p>

An Action of Treſpaſs brought, and a ſpeciall verdict found, and the queſtion was, whether Land held in ancient Demeſne was extendable for debt, and an action of Treſpaſs brought for that cauſe. And Juſtice <hi>Nichols</hi> held it was extendable; for otherwiſe, if it ſhould not be extendable, there would be a fayler of Juſtice; for if a Judgment ſhould be had againſt a man, that had no other Land but what was in ancient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſne, <note place="margin">Nota.</note> and that it could not be extendable, there would be a fayler of Juſtice, which the Law doth not allow of: but an Aſſize, or a re-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſin doth not lye of Land in ancient Demeſne, becauſe of the Seiſin that muſt be given by the Common Law, and it would be prejudicial to the Lord, which the Law allows not: and <hi>Wynch</hi> and <hi>Hubbard</hi> were of the ſame opinion. For ancient demeſne is a good plea, where the Free-hold is to be recovered, or brought in queſtion, but in an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Treſpaſs it is no plea. And note, that by this execution, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Free-hold nor Poſſeſſion is removed, but only the Sheriffe enters to make execution upon a Judgment had in the Common bench in debt, which is a proper Action to be brought there.</p>

If a ſtranger take a Horſe that cometh and ſtrayeth into a Mannor, the Lord may have his action of Treſpaſs. If my ſtray doth ſtray out of my Mannor, and goeth into another Mannor the day before the yeare be ended, I cannot enter into the other Mannor to fetch out the ſtray: If I take an Horſe as a ſtray, and onother ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him from me, the Action lyeth not by the Owner againſt the ſecond taker, becauſe the firſt taker hath deveſted the property out of the Owner. The Defendant in this juſtified the taking of the Mare as a ſtray, and did not alledg that he came as an eſtray, and the Plea was held inſufficient, and the Court held they could not tye them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: And the Defendant ſaid, that the Hayward took the Mare and delivered her to the Defendant; this was but not guilty, and Judgment for the Plaintiff.</p>

                     <p>In waſte, if the Term be ended, and nothing be recovered but da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, there a concord with ſatisfaction is a good plea, and if the Leaſe for years determines, pending the writ, the Plaintiff ſhall recover no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but damages, and not the place waſted. The Defendant may diſclaim in his Action, if he that hath the fee, pleads no waſte done, this is a forfeiture of his Eſtate; the Defendant may plead no waſte done, and give in Evidence that the Tenements at the time of the Demiſe were ruinous, ancient Demeſne is no Plea in Waſte.</p>

Chap. 9.</note> inhabited in <hi>London,</hi> within the Dioceſſe of the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> and was cyted to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the Court of the Arches, and was out of the Dioceſſe of <hi>London,</hi> without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe of the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> againſt the Statute of 23. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. And upon the firſt motion, the Court gave rule to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to ſhew cauſe why the <hi>Prohibition</hi> ſhould not be granted; and to heare the Civilians, and to conferre with them concerning the practiſe and expounding of the Statute of 23. <hi>H. 8. Chap.</hi> 9. And at the day appointed, three ſeverall Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans came into the Court, and were heard according to the former Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and they ſay, that they uſe to cyte any Inhabitant that inhabits in <hi>London</hi> to appeare, and to make anſwer in the Arches originally; for the miſchief that the Statute of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. intends to prevent, was, that thoſe which inhabite in Dioces remote from <hi>London,</hi> ſhould not be ſued here without licence from the Ordinary; but this miſchiefe was not in this caſe. And Doctor <hi>Martin</hi> ſaith, that ſo it was uſed by the ſpace of 427. years before the making of the Statute, and then was complaint made thereof to the Pope, and he was anſwered, that it was the uſe that any man might be cyted to the Arches out of any Dioceſſe in <hi>England:</hi> and alſo that the Arch-Biſhop may hold his
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:41383:137"/>
Conſiſtory in any Dioceſſe within his Juriſdiction and Province: And alſo that the Arch-Biſhop hath concurrent Juriſdiction in the Dioceſs of every Biſhop as well as the Arch-Deacon. And then, if the ſuit be firſt begun in the Court of the Arch-Biſhop, or the Biſhop, or Arch-Deacon, it ought to be there determined where it had its beginning, and ſhall not be inhibited: And then it was objected by <hi>Cooke,</hi> chief Juſtice, that the Statute of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. was affirmed by Canon 94. And this ſheweth the agreement of the Civilians with the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. And to this Doctor <hi>Martin</hi> anſwered, that the ſaid Canon was made in the vacancy of the Church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for the Sea of the Arch-Biſhoprick was then void: and alſo he ſaid, that the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> preſcribes to hold plea of all things, and of all perſons in <hi>England:</hi> And the Pope hath no power to make Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons againſt the Law, nor againſt any Cuſtome or Preſcription; and for this it ſhall be void, and that ſhall not bind the Arch-Biſhop which is againſt the ſaid preſcription; and alſo it ſeems to the Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that the expoſition of the ſaid Statute being the Eccleſiaſticall Statute appointed to them: And alſo it was ſaid by them, that this detracts from the Arch-Biſhops Juriſdiction againſt the cuſtome of the Realm, and every Subject hath intereſt in that: And alſo that the Biſhop takes notice, that they hold plea of the ſaid cauſe, and took no exception, and that made a ſufficient aſſent, and amounted to a licenſe in Law, and ſo concluded that a prohibition ought not to be granted in this Caſe. <hi>Coke,</hi> cheife Juſtice ſaith, that the Miſcheife which the Statute of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. was not only to prevent the miſcheife that thoſe which inhabited in places remote from <hi>London,</hi> ſhould not be cyted to come to the Court of the Arch-Biſhop, but alſo to give to them other priviledges, which by the Law they ought to have, that is, the Appeale that they looſe by the beginning of the Suit in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; for they may appeal from the Ordinary after the ſuit begun here to the Arch-Biſhop; which benefit is loſt if the ſuit be begun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Arch-Biſhop originally: and for that the Inhabitants in <hi>London</hi> are as well within the Miſcheife as the body of the Act of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. And alſo that at the making of the ſaid Canon, the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> which late was, had the Juriſdiction of the ſame then committed unto him, he then being Biſhop of <hi>London:</hi> So that upon the matter he was Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> ſo that the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Sea of <hi>Canterbury</hi> ſhall not be avoidance of the ſaid Canon; and he agreed that a Canon againſt Statute Law, or Common Law, or any Cuſtome, ſhall not bind the Subject; and agreed, that ſo it had been adjudged in this Court. But he denyed that the expoſition of any Statute belonged to the Eccleſiaſticall Court; for the Statute is meer temporall, though it concern ſpirituall things, and it ſhall be expounded according to the Rules of the common Law, ſee 5.

                        <hi>Edw. 4. Keaſors</hi> Caſe: And ſo concludes that this ſuit was againſt the Statute of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. For it ought to have its beginning in the Court of the Biſhop of <hi>London.</hi> And this expoſition of the Statute is made for the Defendant, 94. Canon, which was ex preſly made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Court of Arches, and inflicts ſuſpenſion (by the ſpace of three moneths upon the Judges which offend againſt it) from their Office, and awarded that Prohibition ſhall be granted, and with that agreed <hi>Warburton</hi> and <hi>Foſter,</hi> Juſtices: but <hi>Walmſley</hi> Juſtice was of contrary opinion, that is, that no Prohibition ſhall be granted by the Court of Common Pleas, but in caſe where the Suit is there hanging. And this was objected alſo by the Civilians, And the opinion of the Judges of the Kings Bench cited to prove it, but prohibition was granted that notwithſtanding. And to the objection that the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> may have a conſiſtory in the dioceſſe of every Biſhop, this was denyed but only where he was the Popes Legate, and thenas Legate heſhall have Juriſdiction of all the Dioceſſe of <hi>England,</hi> &amp; it was agreed that there were three ſorts of Legats.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41383:139"/>
the Kings Subjects, were greviouſly burthened with grevious and intollerable charges and exactions, and yet in this time of uſurped power of the Pope, doth not challenge that he might Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, or Impriſon, or Fine in any caſe, but in the caſes eſpecially mentioned in the laſt Caſe aforeſaid, and for that all the uſurped power was annexed to the Imperiall Crown, the which he called the clauſe of annexing, the ſecond was the clauſe of deputation, and this was the clauſe of the Statute, by which the Queen hath power to grant Commiſſion to ſuch perſons being naturall borne Subjects, as her Majeſty, her Heires, or Succeſſors, ſhall thinke fit, to Exerciſe, Uſe, and Execute, under her Majeſty, all manner of Juriſdictons, Privelidges, and Preheminences, in any wiſe touching or concerning any ſpirituall Juriſdiction in all her Majeſties Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and to Viſit, Reforme, Redreſſe, Order, Correct, and amend all ſuch Errors, Hereſies, Schiſmes, Abuſes, Offences, Contemps, and Enormities whatſoever, which by any manner ſpirituall or Eccleſiaſticall power, authority, or Juriſdictions, can or may be lawfull Reformed, Ordered, Redreſſed, Corrected, Reſtrained: or amended, and the third he calleth the clauſe of execution, by which power and authority is given to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to Exerciſe, Uſe, and execute all the premiſes according to the Tenure and effect of the ſaid Letters Patents. And it ſeems it was not the intention of the Statute, to give any power to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, which was not given to the Queen by this Statute, for the clauſe of deputation ſhall not be more ample then the clauſe of annextion, and then the clauſe of execution refers to the firſt too clauſes, as it appears by the words of that (that is) to uſe and execute all the premiſes according to the ſaid Letters Patents, and the premiſes are expounded by the firſt clauſes, that is, Errors, Hereſies, Schiſmes, &amp;c. And the ſaid Letters Patents, refer all Letters Patents before mentioned, where the perſons are appointed to be naturall borne Subjects, and the materiall manner of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, Priviledges, and Preheminences, Eccleſiaſticall, Siprituall, and to Viſit, Reforme, Order, Redreſſe, Correct, and Amend, all ſuch Errors Hereſies, &amp;c. Which by any manner of ſpirituall or Eccleſiaſticall, Power, Authority, or Juriſdiction, can or may lawfully be Reformed, Redreſſed, Ordered, Corrected, Reſtrained or Amended, &amp;c. So that it cannot be intended that they may proceed in any other forme, but only according to the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power and Juriſdiction and no other, for otherwiſe they may Fine, Impriſon, and ranſome any man at their pleaſures, which was never intended by the makers of the ſaid Statutes. But only to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Power and Authority, which at that time was in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, which then were Papiſtes to the high Comiſſioners; the

                     <p>But he would not diſpute that nor affirm nor diſaffirm it, but as the principall caſe was, the obligation was made by Dureſſe, and ſo it may be avoyded, and alſo he ſeemed that they could not examine any lay man upon his Oath, But in cauſes Matrimoniall and Teſtamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and he ſaid that ſo was the common Law before the making of that Statute of <hi>Articulis cleri.</hi> as it appears by a Canon made by <hi>Ottamon</hi> which was a Legate <hi>A Latere</hi> from the Pope in the 22 <hi>H.</hi> 3. and Canonicall, by which is recited, that where ſuch were drawn in length, becauſe that lay men were examined upon their Oathes, and therfore it was provided that lay men ſhould be examined upon their

                     <p>SIr <hi>William Chancey,</hi> was cited before the Ordinary of the Dioceſſe of <hi>Peterbrough,</hi> and ſentenced to do Pennance for Adultery; and this he commuted, and after that he lived in Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery <note place="margin">High Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners Alimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Adultery.</note> with one in his houſe, and had two Baſtards by her, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in Adultery with her for many yeares: and for that he was cited before the high Commiſſioners, and for that, that he would not allow his wife competent allimony; who had ſeperated himſelfe from her company, in reſpect that he lived in Adultery, as aforeſaid; and for that, that he refuſed to become bound to performe the order and the ſentence of the high Commiſſioners, he was committed to the Fleete, and he praied <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> for his Inlargement, and alſo a Prohibition to be directed to the high Commiſſioners; and it was moved by <hi>Nicholls</hi> that fining is not Juſtifiable by the high Commiſſioners no more then Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he ſayd that he was cited out of his Dioceſſe againſt the Statute of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. The which Statute is commanded to be put in execution by the Stat. of 1 <hi>El.</hi> Secondly, the offence that is Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is not an Enormious-crime, and for that ſhall not be puniſhed by the high Commiſſioners, as it appeares By the Statute of 1. <hi>El.</hi> But by the Ordinary. Thirdly, the high Commiſſioners by the Stat. of 1 <hi>El.</hi> ought to obſerve the ſame courſe and order in their proceedings, that the Ordinary uſed before the making of the Statute of 1. <hi>El. &amp;c.</hi> That they could not fine nor Impriſon. But he agreed that the Statute 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7 gives authority to the Ordinary to Impriſon for Adultery, but then the perſon ought to be Eccleſiaſticall, ſo that he agreed, if Sir <hi>William Chancey</hi> had been an Eccleſiaſticall perſon, the Ordinary might Impriſon him for Adultery, and for Allimony they ought to give no remedy if the Husband would inhabit together with his wife; as he ſayd Sir <hi>William Chancey</hi> deſired. But if the Husband refuſe to dwell together with his wife, or thruſt her out of his houſe; and will not ſuffer her to dwell with him, then the Ordinary may compell the Husband to allow allimony for his wife; but the high Commiſſioners ought not to proceed upon that, for this is
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:41383:145"/>
no erronious crime, for by that the party ſhall looſe his benefit of Appeale, which he hath from the Ordinary, to the Metrapolitan, for here the party cannot appeale to any, nor hath any remedy. If the Queen will grant Commiſſion to reneue, and ſo he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that, for that theſe matters appeare upon the returne of the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to be the cauſes of his commitment, he praied that Sir <hi>William Chancey</hi> might be delivered out of Priſon: and prohibition of ſtaying the proceedings of the high Commiſſioners. <hi>Doderidge</hi> the Kings Serjeant for the caſe of Sir <hi>William Chancey</hi> argued that the returne conſiſted of two parts. That is, Adultery and Allimony, and to the manner of the proceedings he would not ſpeake; for he ſaid that the Court had ajudged, that the high Commiſſioners by the Statute of 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Ought not to proceed upon any offences, but thoſe which are Enormious; but he intended that the offence at the firſt was not Enormious, being but Adultery and Allimony, yet when Sir <hi>William Chancey</hi> was ſentenced for that before the Ordinary, and then commuted his pennance, and after that lived divers yeares in Adultery with two ſeverall women, and had two Baſtards; and then he became Incorrigible, and by conſequence the offence is become Enormious, and is properly to be determined before the high Commiſſioners, and ſo praied he might be ſent backe, and that no Prohibition ſhould be granted; and at another day, <hi>Foſter</hi> and <hi>Warburton</hi> ſaid, that the high Commiſſioners ought not to meddle with theſe matters. Nor could not Fine nor Impriſon for that: But <hi>Walmeſley</hi> ſaid that the Statute of 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Hath referred that to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the King, and the King by his Commiſſion, hath given them power to medd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery, and he intends there can be no greater offence then that, and it ſeems to him that the word Enormious ought not to be ſo expounded as it is expounded by the other Judges, that is, an Exorbitant crime, but Enormious is where a thing is made without a rule or againſt Law, for in every action <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>f treſpaſſe the word is uſed <hi>(Et alia enormia ei intulit)</hi> and yet theſe are not intended Exorbitant offences, but other treſpaſſes of the nature of them, which are firſt expreſſed perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culerly, and ſo the Statute hath been expounded for many yeares, and to the Impriſonment he ſaid, that the high Commiſſioners have Impriſoned for the ſpace of 20. yeares, and though that the Statute doth not give power to them to Impriſon, yet this is contained within the Letters Patents, and the ſtatute hath given power to the King to give to them what authority he pleaſeth by his <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> and for that, that it hath been uſed for ſo long
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41383:146"/>
a time he would not ſuddainly alter that, but gave day till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next Tearm for the argument of that. <hi>Coke</hi> cheif Juſtice ſaid, that it was agreed by all that the Impriſonment was unlawfull: and if a Perſon be impriſoned which hath the Priviledge of this Court, this Court may deliver him without Bayle, for the King is the ſupream head by the Common Law, as to the coercive power, and that the <hi>Letters Patents</hi> of the King cannot give power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon, where they cannot impriſon by the Common Law, and ſo it was adjudged in <hi>Sympſons</hi> Caſe, 42. <hi>Eliz,</hi> Which was cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the high Commiſſioners for adultery with <hi>Fiſts</hi> Wife, and adjudged there that they cannot impriſon for that; and he ſaith that an expoſition with the time is the beſt, and for that ſee the ninth of <hi>Eliz. Dyer,</hi> and the 18 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> And alſo it appears by the Statute of 5. <hi>Eliz.</hi> that awards a <hi>(Capias excommunicatum)</hi> which could not be impriſoned before that, and upon this Sir <hi>William Chancey</hi> was bayled; and after by meditation of the Metrapolitan, he was re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>conciled to his wife, and this was the end of this Buſineſſe.</p>

That it is perſonall by which it was enacted, that the religious of the order of <hi>Ceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> that had purchaſed Bills to be diſcharged, to pay tythes, should be in the ſtate they were before; by which it appeares that it is annexed to their perſons, and not to their lands, ſo that their Farmers cannot take benefit of that, Secondly, the priviledge was annexed to this order by canon, which is a thing ſpirituall, and hath no power to meddle with the lands of any man, but the proceeding of that ought to be by inhibition, or excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, ſee 11. <hi>H. 4. 47. 19.

So that there is an apparant difference between that and the lands, which came to the King by the ſtatute of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. For by that the King is diſcharged of paiment of tythes, and ſo are his Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees. It ſeems to me, that the conſtruction of the Cannon may

That all Parſonages im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to them, by the diſſolutions are become prſentable and ſo of theſe which were annexed to the Templers, for theſe ſhall not be transferred to Saint <hi>Johns,</hi> though that the Lands are 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. 11.

H. 8. The generall words of that do not extend to diſcharge the Land of Tithes, though that the Statute makes mention of Tithes, if there be not a ſpeciall proviſion by the Statute that the Lands ſhall be diſcharged, and this appears by the words of the Statute of, 31, H. 8. where the general words are as generall and beneficiall as the words of this Statute, and yet there is aſpeciall proviſion for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the payment of tithes, by which it appears that the generall words donot diſcharge that, and ſo the generall words of 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. are as larg and beneficiall as the generall words of the Statute of 31 H. 8. And yet this ſhall not diſcharge the Land of payment of Tithes, and this compared to the Caſe of the Marqueſſe of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> of a writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that, that ſhall not be transferred to the King by Attainder of Land in taile for treaſon by the Statute of 26 H. 8. or 33 H. 8.

But it is reſolved in the Biſhop of <hi>Canterburies</hi> Caſe, 2 <hi>Coke</hi> 46, that the ſtatute of 31 H. 8. ſhall not extend to theſe lands which come to the K. by the ſtatute of 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. to make them exempt from paying of Tithes, and to the Caſe in 10. <hi>Eliz.</hi> that is but an opinion conceived, and that the Prior hath this priviledge from <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the Farmer ſhall pay Tithes, and the queſtion was in the <hi>Chancery;</hi> and upon conſideration of the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of, 31 H. 8. It ſeems that the Patentee himſelf ſhall be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (as long as by his own hands he tills it) and the ſtatute of, 32. H. 8. Upon which the ſtate of the queſtion truly conſiſts, was not conſidered, and alſo it was not there judicially in queſtion. And to the caſe of <hi>Spurling</hi> againſt <hi>Graves</hi> in Prohibition, conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was granted, for that, that the ſtatute was miſtaken, and ſo the award was upon the form of the pleading only, and not upon the matter, and ſo he concluded, and prays conſultation, <hi>Houghton</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant <note place="margin">Houghton.</note> to the contrary, and he agreed that it is a perſonall priviledg: and if the Order of St. <hi>Johns</hi> had been diſſolved by death, that then the priviledg shall be determined, and this appears by the Stat. of 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 4. before cyted: and alſo the caſe of 10. <hi>Eliz. Dyer,</hi> 277. 60. did doubt of that: but he relyed upon the manner &amp; words of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; that is, that <hi>Hoſpitallers</hi> are not held to pay Tithes, &amp; it is as a reall compoſition made betwixt the Lord and another Spirituall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, of which the Tenants shall take advantage, as it is reſolved in the Bishop of <hi>Wincheſters</hi> caſe. Alſo as if a man grant a Rent charge, if the Grantee dye without Heir, the grant is determined: But if the Grantee grant that over, and after dyes without Heir, yet the Rent continues, 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Or if Tenant in tayl grant Rent in fee, and dies, the grant is void. But if he after ſuffers a recovery, or makes a Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Rent continues good till the Eſtate taile be recontinued, as it is reſolved in <hi>Capels</hi> caſe. So here the order of Templers hath been determined by death, the priviledg hath been determined, but inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Land was transferred by <hi>Parliament</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> this continues. Alſo the words of the <hi>Statute</hi> of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. are apt, not only to transfer all the Intereſt which the Pryor had in his Lands, but alſo his Priviledges and Immunities to the King; and he agreed, it is not material if the words <hi>Tythes</hi> are mentioned in the <hi>Statute</hi> or not. But the word upon which he relyes, and which comprehends this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41383:147"/>
caſe, is the word Priviledg, which takes away the Law; for where the Law binds them to pay <hi>Tithes,</hi> the priviledg diſcharges them: And the words of the <hi>Statute</hi> are taken in the moſt large extent, that is, all Mannors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Priviledges, Immunities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of what nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be they <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> or <hi>Temporall,</hi> which appertain and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by or in the right of their Religion; but the Priviledges and Immunities they have in the right of their Religion, and theſe the <hi>Statute</hi> of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. gives to the King, and there is no cauſe that they ſhould ſurmount, or that the <hi>Statute</hi> should give to them more favour then the former <hi>Statute</hi> hath given to thoſe religious houſes which were diſſolved by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 31. <hi>Eliz.</hi> For the <hi>Hoſpitallers</hi> of S. <hi>Johns</hi> were favourers and maintainers of the Popes Juriſdictions as well as the others, as it appears by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Alſo the words of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. hath only the words of the King and his Succeſſors, and doth not ſpeak of his Aſſigns, which words are expreſſed in the <hi>Statute</hi> of 32. H. 8 But it is provided by 32. H. 8. that the King cannot uſe at his will and pleaſure, which amounts to ſo much. Alſo the <hi>Statute</hi> of 31. H. 8. extends to all Religious houſes by expreſſe words: and it ſhall not be intended, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the makers of the <hi>ſtatute</hi> was to omit that which were to be of the Order of S. <hi>Johns</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the miſcheif was in equal degree. And it hath been agreed that they are religious perſons, and that they were under the obedience of the Pope, for ſo they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of 17. <hi>R.</hi> 2. by which the poſſeſſions of the <hi>Templers</hi> was transferred to them, ſo that on the matter they are religious, which shall not be intended ſo largely, as every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an may be ſaid religious, but Secular, and Regular, which vow O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, Chaſtity, and Poverty; and for the proof of this, he cyted a preſident. Alſo it ſeems to him that the <hi>Statute</hi> of 30. H. 8. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to thoſe Lands which come to the King by the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. And it is not like to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterburies</hi> caſe, 2 <hi>Coke,</hi> 47. upon the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. For that <hi>Statute</hi> gives the Lands to the King for other cauſes, and not for the ſame cauſes which are contained in the <hi>Statute</hi> of 31. H. 8. But the <hi>Statute</hi> of 32. H. 8. is for the ſame cauſe, and with the ſame reſpect to Religion. But if theſe Lands have come to the King by Exchange, or by Attainder, then they ſhall not be intended to be within the <hi>Statute</hi> of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. But if another <hi>Statute</hi> be made in 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. by which all Religious houſes have been given to the King, this ſhall be intended within the <hi>Statute</hi> of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. And the Judges before whom the cauſe depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded judicially, ought not to be ignorant of that, and ſo he prayed that a <hi>Prohibition</hi> might be. <hi>Shirley</hi> Serjeant for the Defendant, at another day in <hi>Trinity</hi> Tearm 9. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> argued, that the queſtion <note place="margin">Shirley.</note> only depended upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. upon which the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition</hi>
                        <pb n="24" facs="tcp:41383:148"/>
is founded with the <hi>Statute</hi> of 31. <hi>H.</hi> 8. by which the Lands of Monaſteries are given to the King, do not extend to thoſe Lands which are given after by <hi>Parliament.</hi> But he intented that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution which diſcharges the Templers of the payment of Tithes is ſpirituall, and extends only to ſpirituall perſons which may preſcribe in not tything; ſee 38. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 6. 2 of <hi>Coke,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> Caſe, 44. Alſo he intended when an appropriation was made to the Templers, that this is determined by diſſolution of their Order. So upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 5. of Priors Aliens, which have Impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, or which have Rent iſſuing out of them; and after the Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation is diſſolved, the Rent is gone, for the Impropriation is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Alſo he took exception to the pleading, for that, that it is only a branch of the <hi>Statute</hi> of 32. H. 8. And then by vertue of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes he was ſeiſed, which is not good: and ſo hee concluded, that it was a good cauſe of demurrer upon the <hi>Prohibition,</hi> and prayed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation. <hi>Barker</hi> Serjeant for the Plaintiff ſeems the contrary, and <note place="margin">Barker.</note> yet he agreed, that he could not take benefit of the <hi>Statute</hi> of 31. H. 8. for that, that theſe Lands came to the King by another <hi>Statute,</hi> but he relyed upon the words of the 32. H. 8. which was made only for the diſſolution of the Hoſpitall of St. <hi>Johns</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Tythes are as ancient as any thing that the Church hath, and before that any Law was written, for <hi>Abraham</hi> payed Tithes to <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> but it doth not appeare that he paid the tenth part; but Tithes are due by the Judiciall Law of God, and the King hath power to appoint what quantity ſhall be paid. But at the beginning there were Sacrifices, Oblations, and Tithes And it was ordained by <hi>Edgar,</hi> King of this Realm, that Tithes ſhould be given to the Mother Church. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <hi>Edmund, Ethelſtone, William</hi> the Conquerour, and the Councell of <hi>Magans</hi> ſpecially provided that Tithes ſhould be paid, but did not appoint when they ſhould be paid. But the firſt Law which appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the quantity was made in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. and this ordained when they ought to pay the Tenth with the feare of God. And it was reſolved in <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Cresbrooks</hi> caſe in the Commentaries, after ſeverance they are temporall, and Action lyes againſt him which carries them away, as of <hi>Mortuary,</hi> as it is reſolved, 10. H. 4. 1. 6. And before the Councell of <hi>Lateran,</hi> every one might pay his Tithes to what perſon he would, and then were paid to Monaſteries as Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: But of Tithes which are due to any by preſcription, hee which payes them hath no ſuch election, but ought to pay them to him which claims them by preſcription, 14. H. 4. 17. If a Parſon of a Pariſh claim Tithes in another Pariſh as portion of Tithes due by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to his Rectory, he ought to ſhew the place ſpecially. So if Nunns preſcribe to have a portion of Tithes, they ought to ſhew the place, for it is a queſtion if they are ſpirituall, or not; for their
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41383:148"/>
office is only to pray in their houſe, 24. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. So the book of Entries, if a man claim Tithes to his Pupil, he ought to ſhew in what place the Tithes lye, in the 17. <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. The order of the Templers was diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and their poſſeſſions annexed to St. <hi>Johns</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and they did not claim by any Bull of the Pope, nor other ſpirituall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non but by preſcription, which is priviledg and private Common law, and this appears by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> 2 Chap. 47. That is, that they are conſervators of his priviledges. Alſo he ſaith, that the <hi>Statute</hi> of 2. H. 4. diſcharges Farmers without ſpeaking of Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. And the <hi>Statute</hi> of 7. H. 4. 6. uſeth the ſame words which are contained in the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 32. H. 8. That is, that none ſhall put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution any Buls, containing any priviledges to be diſcharged of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Tithes. And <hi>Mephams</hi> Canon in time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. ſaith, <hi>Let the cuſtome be obſerved with the feare of God.</hi> And another Canon, That cuſtome of not Tything, or of the manner of Tything, if they paid leſſe then the tenth part, ſee <hi>Panormitan</hi> upon that; ſeek of the Caſe between <hi>Veſey</hi> and <hi>Weeks</hi> in the Exchequer, upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of 27.

And that to be done in caſe only where the Law civill or Canon doth affirm execution of ſuch requeſt or inſtance of Juriſdiction, to be lawfull or tollerable, and for the better diſcuſſing of this queſtion, the Judges had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to heare two Doctors of the Civill Law, which at this day at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Court; the firſt Doctor <hi>Martin</hi> ſaid, that theſe generall words have reference to the Executor, and not to the maker of the requeſt, and this requeſt may be made for all cauſes, but ought to be made to him, which hath concurrent or immediate Juriſdiction to which appeal may be made, and that the Arch-Biſhop hath ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Juriſdiction in all the dioceſſe of his Province; and this is the cauſe that he may viſit, but this Juriſdiction is bound and tied up to the Ordinary, and when he will leave that at large, then the Arch-Biſhop may proceed, as he is Arch-Biſhop, and the cauſe of requeſt need not to be contained in the Inſtrument, for when the power
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41383:150"/>
which was bound up is unbound and at large, then he may proceed: Doctor <hi>Talbot,</hi> that the requeſt is referred to three, to the Biſhop, Dean, and Arch-Deacon. And the perſons to whom the requeſt is to be made are three: The Arch-Biſhop, two Biſhops, three, or ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Judg, and the Biſhop and his Commiſſary are all one, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt made by the Commiſſary ſhall be as good, as requeſt made by the Biſhop himſelfe.

                     <p>IN Prohibition the Plaintiff Suggeſts, that within ſuch a Town was ſuch a cuſtome; that every Inhabitant which maintained a family, and dairy, for manuring his land, and maintenance of his family, have uſed of time out of memory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to pay tythes of Corn, growing upon his Farm, in kind, and by reaſon thereof have uſed to be diſcharged of after crop, of the ſaid land. And alſo that they have uſed to pay tythe milk, and tythe Calves in kind, and by reaſon thereof have been diſcharged of tythe of yong and barren Beaſtes, and the Plaintiff ſuggeſted further, that he occupied a Farm and maintained a family, and dairy, for the manurance of that, and maintenance of his family; and hath paied his tythe Corn, and milk, and Calves, in kinde: And for that ought
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41383:151"/>
to be diſcharged of tythes for the after crop, and for yong and barren Beaſtes, and for the tenthes of which, ſuit was begun in the Court Chriſtian, and upon demurrer joyned upon Prohibition, the cuſtome was debated whether it were good or no, and it was moved firſt by <hi>Houghton</hi> Serjeant for the Defendant, that the cuſtome was not good, inſomuch that by that the Plaintiff was not to pay more, then by the Law he ought, for he ought to pay tythe Corne, and milk and Calves, in kind: And this is no more then the Law compells him to do, and this cannot be a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to diſcharge him of other things. For all things which renue ought to pay tythes, of Common Right, as after paſtute, and barren Cattell, and Corne, and milk. And all other things which renue; if it be not good cuſtome to the contrary, which is grounded upon conſideration; and then to conſider how much conſideration ſhall be valuable in other Caſes, and what not: And to that it appeares in 9. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 18. and 19; in Treſpaſſe upon the Statute of 5. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. The Defendant pleads accord, that the Plaintiff entred into his land againe, and agreed that that was not barr, inſomuch as agreement without ſatisfaction is not barr, and entry into lands, is no more then he might do without the agreement, and for that it is not good for default of conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; ſo in 12. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 15. <hi>a.</hi> in treſpaſs for goods taken; the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant pleads arbitrement, that is; for that that the Defendant, hath taken the goods of the Plaintiff, and that he ſhould deliver them to the Plaintiff, in full ſatisfaction: And agreed that this is no good award, inſomuch that this cannot be ſatisfaction, for that that the goods were the proper goods of the Plaintiff: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, that he hath his goods againe; yet he is not ſatisfied for the taking. But if the award had been, that the Defendant ſhould redeliver his goods, and carry them to ſuch a place certain, at his own coſts and charges, then it had been good: See 45. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. accordingly. So in an action upon the Caſe, upon an Aſſumpſit made in conſideration that the Plaintiff hath payd due debt, is not good, for this is no conſideration, and ſo in the principall Caſe the Preſcription is not good, inſomuch that he hath not ſuggeſted more or other conſideration, which by the Law he ought to do: But he agreed that if he had ſuggeſted, that the Plaintiff, had plowed and manured the land, and diſpoſed of the tythes of the Corn, for the benefit of the Parſon, in other manner then the Law compelled him; then the firſt preſcription had been good, and ſo he concluded, and praied Judgement for the Defendant: <hi>Hutton</hi> Serjeant for the Plaintiff, in the Prohibition ſeems the contrary, and that the Suggeſtion, and Preſcription, and Cuſtome, Contained in that are good: And to the Objection, that it is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41383:152"/>
no conſideration, that the Cuſtome may be founded; he intended, that this is a ground upon immunity ſubſequent to the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, as of things which are not tythable, as in the generall Caſe of things, which are for the maintenance of the family; for Plowing and Manuring of the land, ſhall not pay tythes, as in a ſuit for tythes for herbage, ſuggeſtion that they were depaſtured, by labouring Cattell, which Plowed and Manured the Land, of which the Parſon had tythes, or ſmall Wood, which are cut or imployed for the fencing of a Farm, or fuell ſpent in the Farme, ſhall not pay tythes; inſomuch that without that, the Farme cannot be Manured nor the Famaly ſuſtained. And ſo by conſequence the Parſon ſhall not have any tythe Corn, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that no Corn will grow without manuring; and alſo the Parſon by thoſe hath the more tyth Corn, and ſo he hath conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that, for the better that the Farme is fenced and manured the more tythe the Parſon ſhall have: So the Farmer may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of tythes, for Rakeings, inſomuch that he Mowes and Cocks the tythes for the Parſon at his own coſts, and this is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient conſideration: And alſo he inſiſted upon the Statute of 2. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. Which provides that tythes ſhall be payd in the ſame manner, as they were payd for 40. yeares before, and he cited one <hi>Jeſſopps</hi> caſe to be adjudged in Prohibition; Paſche 36. <hi>Eliz.</hi> Upon ſuit in Court Chriſtian, for flocks, and locks of Wooll: And the Cuſtome was alleaged, that the owner had woond the tythe for the Parſon, and in conſideration of that, ought to be diſcharged of tythes, of locks and flocks, if they be not made by Covin, to defraud the Parſon; and theſe were demanded by the name of wooll diſperſed, and 18. <hi>Eliz;</hi> it was adjudged, that tythes ſhall, not be made for Brick, and in Prohibition; the ſuggeſtion was grounded upon the generall immunity, and inſomuch that it was made of land, for which no tythes are to be payd; inſomuch that it doth not renue, that for this cauſe tythes ought not to be payd, for the Brick which is made of that, and ſo of Mynes, and ſo Lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, and Toppings, and bark of Trees ſhall pay no tythes: But are within the Statute of 40. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 5. of wood to be falne, as it is reſolved in <hi>Soby and Molyns</hi> caſe in the Commentaries: And he agreed that for herbage the tenth gate, or proffit of that ought to be payd, if there be not a cuſtome to the contrary; but in the Principall caſe he intended that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that was payd in the Corn, and in that the Parſon hath recompence and conſideration as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſo he concludes and praies Judgment for the Plaintiff: <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigde</hi> Serjeant of the King argued that the Cuſtome is not good, as it is here ſuggeſted, for the conſideration is of ſome things which ought to pay tythes in kind, and ſo upon the matter is no
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41383:152"/>
ſideration at all, for he intended that tythes ſhould be due by divine right, as due by the Manuring and Tillage of the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupier, in whoſe ſoever hands that the land commeth; if it be not in the hands of the Parſon himſelfe, 30 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 43. <hi>Dyer.</hi> 20.

One Spirituall, the other Temporall, the ſpirituall in reſpect of their Order, and the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall in reſpect of Cuſtome and Preſcription, and alſo by grant, as it is agreed in the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterburies</hi> Caſe, 2. <hi>Coke;</hi> but this is in the caſe of a ſpirituall man before the Statute of, 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which was capable of them in taking, and that he might preſcribe in not Tithing, but a lay man cannot be diſcharged but for ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and conſideration, for he cannot preſcribe in not Tithing, and for that in the caſe here the thing to be conſidered is, if it be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſatisfaction and conſideration, and to that he intended that the payment of a duty, that is Tyth Corn and Tyth Hay, cannot be ſatisfaction &amp; conſideration for another duty, and this was the Reaſon of <hi>Piggot</hi> &amp; <hi>Hernes</hi> Caſe, that the Lord of a Mannor, in conſideration of <note place="margin">Modus deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandi.</note> 20. Nobles yearly paid to the Parſon, preſcribes to have the tithes of a Hamlet, and in conſideration of that, the Lord himſelf and his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, were diſcharged of payment of Tithes, but there the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and ſatisfaction was the cauſe which made the cuſtome good, ſee 2. <hi>Coke</hi> 45. <hi>a.</hi> And then he proceeded and examined the manner of the ſatisfaction in the principall caſe, which is, that the Plaintiff ſhall pay tyth Corne and Hay, and nothing for Milk and Calves, but by reaſon thereof ſhall be diſcharged, as if he ſhould ſay, that becauſe he payeth tythe Corne, therefore he ſhall pay no tithe Milk, and he intended that the nature of ſatisfaction is to give content to the party, as if the preſcription had been, that the Plaintiff ſhould pay ſo much Money, and in conſideration of that, or that he ſhall make the tithe in Cocks, or rake it, or mow it at his owne charge, this is a good preſcription, aed there are diverſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents of that, but no preſident is of this forme, as the caſe here is; for money ſhall be intended the greater value, and more benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for the Parſon, then his Tithes in kind, and Money is the value of every thing, and may give contentment to the party which receives it, &amp; he cited Bookes of, 9. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 19. and 12 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 15. and 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41383:153"/>
for it cannot give contentment to the party, otherwiſe it is, if it be that the Defendant ſhall carry them to another place and there shall deliver them, for it cannot be ſatisfaction and contentment to the party, and for that, that here the Plaintiff hath not made more then the Law compells him, and that it was his own duty, and for that the preſcription wants conſideration, it shall not be good, and alſo by reaſon thereof it can be no good diſcharge, for this cannot be ſatisfaction, but he ſaid, it was adjudged <hi>Paſch 20 Jacobi</hi> between <hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Aubery,</hi> that Money was a good conſideration and ſatisfaction for tithes, and ſo he concluded and prayed judgment for the Defendant; note that this cauſe was adjudged <hi>Hillary 8.

                        <hi>Haughton</hi> Serjeant moved for a Prohibition, for that the Suit was begun in the Admirall Court upon Charter party made beyond Sea upon the Land, and Prohibition was granted, though it be for a thing made in <hi>Paris,</hi> or in another place beyond the ſea, if it be not upon the Main Sea, but if the Defendant there admitts the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the Court and ſuffers ſentence, then the Court will not upon a bare ſurmiſe grant a Prohibition, after the admittance of the party himſelf; if it be not in a thing which appeareth within the Libell, that is, that the Act was not made within the Juriſdiction of the Sea, and to this difference all the Court a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.</p>

Provides, that every Parſon promoted to any Parſonage, ſhall be perſonally reſident, and abiding in, at, and upon his ſaid Benefice, and in caſe any ſuch ſpirituall Parſon keep not reſidence at his Benefice, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, but abſent himſelf willfully by the ſpace of a month together or two Moneths, to be accounted at ſeverall times, in any one year, and makes his reſidence and abiding in any other places by ſuch time, that then he ſhall forfeit for every ſuch default ten pounds, the one halfe to the King, and the other halfe to the Informer; and if the ſaid Doctor <hi>Newman</hi> was not reſident, and incurred the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of this <hi>Statute</hi> was the queſtion, and it was argued by <hi>Haughton,</hi> that he had incurred the penalty of the <hi>Statute,</hi> and was non-reſident within the intent, and he argued that to ſome intent all the Pariſh may be ſaid the Benefice of the Parſon, for that, that he hath benefit out of it, and he is called Parlon of ſuch a Town or Pariſh, but this is not the Benefice that the <hi>Statute</hi> intends, upon which he ought to be <hi>reſident,</hi> as in the 29.

                     <p>A Man was bound to pay to the Plaintiff ten pound within ten dayes after his return from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Plaintiff pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that he had been there, and the Plaintiff after ten dayes brought his Action upon the Obligation, without making of any proofe that he had been there, and if that were good, or that he ought to make proofe of that before he brings his Action, this was the queſtion, and alſo he ought to make proofe, then what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proofe, and it was moved by <hi>Haughton,</hi> that when a thing is true, and is not referred to any certain and particular manner of proof, as before what ſhall be done, or how the proofe ſhall be made, the party may bring his Action, and the other party may take his Iſſue, upon the doing of the thing which ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved &amp; the triall of that ſhall be proofe ſufficient, and in his count he need not to aver that he had been there, ſee 10 <hi>Ed. 4. 11. b. c. 15, Ed. 4. 25. 7 R. 2.

And here alſo the proofe, if any ſhould, it ought to be made within ten dayes, the which cannot be made by Jury in ſo ſhort a time, as it is ſaid by <hi>Choke</hi> in 10 <hi>Ed. 4. 11. b.</hi> though that he agreed, that when a man may ſpeake of proofe generally, that ſhall be intended proofe by Jury, for that, that this is the moſt high proofe, as it is ſaid in <hi>Gregories</hi> Caſe, 6 <hi>Coke 20. a.</hi> and 10 <hi>Ed. 4. 11. b.</hi> But of the other part it was ſaid by <hi>Sherley</hi> Serjeant, that true it is that proofe ought to be made for the Defendant, as the Caſe is in 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 11. That then ſuch proofe ſhould be ſufficient, for the Plaintiff may bring his Action before that the Defendant may by poſſibility bring his Action, but where the Plaintiff ought to make the proofe, there he ought to prove, that before that he bring his Action, and it ſhall be accounted his Folly, that he would bring his action before he had proved that, but all the Juſtices agreed, that the Plaintiff need not to make any other

The caſe was, the Ward of <hi>Moore</hi> was placed at the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> to be inſtructed in the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Sciences, and was married by the Wife of <hi>Doctor Huſſey</hi> to the Daughter of the ſaid Wife, which ſhe had by a former Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. And for that <hi>Moore</hi> brought this Writ againſt <hi>Doctor Huſſey</hi> and his Wife, and the Miniſter which married them, and all others which were preſent at the ſaid marriage, or Actors in that. And upon Evidence it appeared, that <hi>Doctor Huſſey</hi> was not preſent nor Actor in it; and for that the Jury found him not guilty, but they found all the other Defendants guilty of the ſaid Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for upon the Evidence it appeares, that the Wife of <hi>Doctor Huſſey</hi> procured and provided the Miniſter which married them, and in the laſt Michaelmas Terme this was tried here at the Barr, and the Jury aſſeſſed Dammages to ten pound, and the value of the Ward to eighty pound, for ſo much <hi>Moore</hi> proved that he could have ſold him for, and alſo the Jury found, that the Ward doth appeare married being of the Age of 16. yeares at the time of his marriage, and exceptions were taken to that, for that it was not found of what age the Ward was at the time of the verdict, and it was urged by <hi>Dodridge</hi> that by the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. chapt. 39. The preciſe age ought to be found at the time of the verdict. Secondly it was found that the Ward did appeare married,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41383:166"/>
and doth not ſay without Licenſe of the Guardian, and the Guardian may give his conſent, where the Ward marries himſelfe, and then there is no cauſe of action. The third and other exception was taken in the behalfe of the Wife of <hi>Doctor Huſſey,</hi> for that ſhee being a married Wife was found guilty of Raviſhment of Ward, againſt the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the 2. chap. 39. And it was urged that it was not the intent of the Statute that provides, that he which did Raviſh; not having right in the marriage, though he ſhould reſtore the Boy naked and not married, or ſhould ſatisfie for the marriage, he ſhall be puniſhed for the tranſgreſſion, by Impriſonment for two yeares, and if he ſhall not reſtore him, or ſhall marry the Heire, after the marrying yeares, and cannot ſatisfie for the marriage, he ſhall abjure the Realme, or ſhall have perpetuall Impriſonment. And it was objected that a married woman, was not intended to be within this Statute, for it is apparent, that a married woman hath not wherewith to make ſatisfaction, and it ſhall not be intended that ſhe ſhall have perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Impriſonment, or make abjuration, for this was to make ſeparation betweene the Husband and his Wife, and ſo it was adjourned.

And it is not like to the Caſe of the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, preſcription the 55. Where is Preſcription that the Owner of the Soile ſhall be excluded from his Common for part of the yeare, for there the other claimes all the Veſture of the Land, and ſo may well exclude the Lord, but not when he claimes it but as Common, but it was agreed that by Lawes by the Commoners conſent they may order that their great Cattell ſhall be put in in ſuch Feild only, untill ſuch a Feaſt, and after that for ſheep and ſwine, and this is good, as it appears by 46 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 25. And <hi>Coke</hi> cheife Juſtice ſaid, that ſuch preſcription to have Common and to exclude the Owner of the Soyle, is not good, and he ſaith that ſo it hath been adjudged between <hi>Whyte of Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, 31 Eliz.</hi> And in <hi>Cletherwoods</hi> Caſe of the <hi>Middle Temple,</hi> but he ſaid that Preſcription to have all the Veſture of the Land, is good for ſuch a time, and at the firſt day of the Argument of this Caſe, <hi>Foſter</hi> Juſtice ſeemed that the preſcription was good, and might have reaſonable beginning, that is by Grant, as if they have Common together, and they agree that one ſhall have all for one part of the yeare, and the other for another part of the year, and that ſhall be good, to which <hi>Coke</hi> anſwered, that that cannot be by Preſcription to have that as Common, and at another day <hi>Coke,</hi> cited <hi>Shirland and Whites</hi> Caſe to be adjudged, 26 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Kings Bench, to be preſcription to have common in the Waſte of the Lord, and to exclude the Lord to have common in the place, and adjudged to be void preſcription, and alſo he cited a caſe between <hi>Chimery</hi> and <hi>Fiſt,</hi> where preſcription was to have common in the Soile of the Lord, and that the Lord ſhall have feeding but for ſo many cattell, and adjudged that the Preſcription was not good to exclude the Lord, but a man may preſcribe to have the firſt Crop, or the firſt Veſture of anothers Land, and it is good, and with that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the reſolution in <hi>Kiddermiſters</hi> Caſe in the Star-Chamber; <hi>Warburton</hi> juſtice ſaid, that this preſcription is not for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding of the Lord, but for their good ordering of their Lands, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Book of 46 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3 25. before cited, that the great Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell ſhould have the firſt feeding, and after that the ſheep: <hi>Coke</hi> ſaid, that if it had appeared by the pleading, that all the Demeſnes of

the Lord ought to be common, and in conſideration, that the Lord had incloſed part, and injoyed that in ſeverall, the Free-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Tenants of the Mannor which have Common over all the Reſidue, and exclude the Lord, and this ſhall be good by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, and it is adjourned, ſee 15 <hi>Ed. 2.

a Recovery, or to levy a Fine, as it is reſolved in <hi>Mildmayes</hi> caſe, 6 <hi>Coke</hi> 40.

For all lawfull Acts made by Tenant in taile ſhall binde the Iſſue, as 44 <hi>Ed. 3. Octavian Lumbards</hi> Caſe, Grant of Rent for Releaſe of right is good, and ſhall binde the Iſſue, for there are foure incidents to an Eſtate tayle, Firſt, That he ſhall not be punished for Waſte. Secondly, That his Wife ſhall be indowed. Thirdly, That the Husband of the Wife Tenant in Tayle, ſhall be Tenant by the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſie. Fourthly, That Tenant in Tayle may ſuffer common recovery. So that a Condition which reſtraines him ſo that he cannot ſuffer a common Recovery is void, for it is incident to his act, and it is a lawful Act, and for the benefit of the Iſſue as it is intended, in reſpect of the intended recompence, and he ſaid that a Feoffment to a woman co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or infant, ſhall be conditionall, that they shall not make a Feoffment during their diſability, is good, for that the Law hath then made them diſable to make a Feoffment, ſo a Leaſe for life or years upon condition that he shall not alien, is good, in reſpect of the confidence that was repoſed in them by the Leſſor, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that the Condition in this Caſe which reſtraines Tenant in Taile generally from alienation. Firſt, was uncertain in reſpect of the words (conclude and agree) Secondly for that it was againſt Law &amp; ſo void, and for that prayed Judgment for the Defendant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hutton</hi> Serjeant for the Plaintiff, he argued that the verball agreement of the Wife ſhall bind her, notwithſtanding the Coverture, for that, that this is for her benefit, for in performance of the ſaid agreement, ſhe ſuffers a recovery to the uſe of her ſelfe and her Heires, and ſo Dockes the remainder, and he agreed the caſes put by the other part which concerne free-hold, but he ſaid in caſes of Limitation of Eſtates, as if Limitation be, if a Ring be tendred by a woman that the Land ſhall remaine to her, and ſhe takes a Husband, and after that ſhe and the Husband tender the Ring, this ſhall be ſufficient tender, and it ſhall be intended the Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the wife, and 10. <hi>H 7. 20. a.</hi> A man deviſes his Lands to a married woman to be ſold, ſhe may ſell them to her Husband; And though that it be not any agreement of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band only, yet here is an act done, in a <hi>Precipe</hi> brought againſt the Wife, and ſhe vouches over, for that is not only an agreement, but an Act executed, upon which the Eſtate Limited to the eldeſt Siſter ſhall take effect, and the 2. <hi>Coke</hi> the 27. <hi>a. Beckwiths</hi> Caſe. If the Husband and the Wife, joyne in a Fine of Land of the Wife, the Wife only without the Husband may declare the uſe of that. And he intended it was a Limitation and not a condition,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41383:170"/>
and ſo it might be well at this day in caſe of deviſe, and then the Act ſhall be, that the Eſtate is Limited to have beginning, being made the Eſtate of the youngeſt Daughter which made the Act, ſhall be deſtroyed and determined, for if it be a condition, then all the Daughters ſhall take advantage of that, and this was not the intent of the Deviſor, for they are the parties which should be reſtrained by the deviſe from Alienation. And alſo he cited <hi>Wenlocke</hi> and <hi>Hamonds</hi> Caſe cited in <hi>Bractons</hi> Caſe, 3. <hi>Coke 20. b.</hi> Where a Copy-holder in fee of Lands deviſable in Burrough <hi>Engliſh,</hi> having three Sons and a Daughter, deviſeth his Lands to his eldeſt Son, paying to his Daughter and to his other Sons forty shillings within two yeares after his death, the Deviſor maketh ſurrender according to the uſe of his Will and dieth, the eldeſt Son admitted, and doth not pay the money within the two yeares, and adjudged that though the word paiment makes a condition, yet in this caſe of deviſe the Law conſtrues that to a Limitation, and the reaſon is there given to be, for that, that is, it shall be a condition, then that shall diſcend upon the eldeſt Son, and then it ſtands at his pleaſure, if the Brothers or Siſter shall be paid, or not, and 29. <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 17. cytes in <hi>Nourſe</hi> and <hi>Scholaſticas</hi> Caſe, Commentaries 412. <hi>b.</hi> where a man ſeiſed of Lands in Fee deviſable, deviſeth them to one for life, and that he should be Chapleine and ſingle for his Soule all his life, ſo that after his deceaſe, the ſayd tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments should remaine to the Commonalty of the ſame Towne, to finde a Chapleine perpetuall for the ſame Tenements, and dyed, and adjudged that this ſhall not be a condition of which the heir ſhal take advantage, but limitation upon which the remainder shall take effect; and alſo he cyted S. <hi>E.

Mildmayes</hi> Caſe, and alſo the words ſubſequent are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant, that the Eſtate tayle shall ceaſe, as if the Tenant in tayle were dead, and not otherwiſe, which is abſurd and repugnant, for the Eſtate tayle doth not determine by his death, if he doe not dye without Iſſue: And alſo he ſayd, that it is more reaſonable that the perpetuity in <hi>Scholaſticas</hi> Caſe, for here the limitation depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on agreement, which is a thing certaine, upon which the Iſſue may be joyned; and alſo the condition doth ſtand with the nature of the Eſtate tayle, and for the preſervation of it; and Recovery is againſt the nature of it, for this deſtroyes the Eſtate tayle, and is onely a conſequent of it, and not parcell of the nature of the Eſtate, and this is the reaſon that <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith, That an Eſtate tayle upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that he ſhould not alien, is good, for that preſerves the Eſtate, and alſo preſerves <hi>Formedon</hi> for him in reverſion, if there be a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance; and with that agreed 13 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 23. 24. and he ſayd, that there was a Judgement in the point for his Clyent for another part of the Land, and he cyted 31 <hi>Edw. 5. Fitz.

                        <pb n="70" facs="tcp:41383:171"/>
So that he intended that this ſhall be intended the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Husband onely, and not of the Wife, and yet he argued that Declaration of a uſe by a marryed Wife, ſhall be good, according to <hi>Beckwiths</hi> Caſe: But he ſayd, That the reaſon of that is, for that that ſhe is party to the Recovery, which is a matter of Record, and as long as the Record remaines in force, ſo long the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the uſe shall be good; and alſo he argued, that if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition being, that if the Wife conclude or agree to any act to make diſcontinuance, that then, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that that shall be intended unlawfull acts, and Recovery is no unlawfull act, and for that shall not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reſtraint of the Condition, as the Earl of <hi>Arundels</hi> Caſe, 17 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 343. and admitting that it is a limitation, yet it shall be of the ſame nature as a condition, and as well as a condition, that Tenant in tayle shall not ſuffer Recovery, is voyd.</p>
                     <p>So alſo is ſuch Limitation void, and ſo it was intended before the Statute of <hi>Donis Conditionalibus</hi> and it appeares by the pleading, that the parties did not intend to take advantage of the agreement, for it is pleaded that at the time of the Recovery ſuffered, the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Daughter was ſeiſed of an eſtate tayl, the which could not be if her eſtate were determined and deſtroyed by the (agreement and concluſion) ſo that the laſt words make the Forfeyture; for the firſt are not unlawfull, and before the execution of the Recovery the eſtate tayl is determined, and ſo he concluded, and praied Judgement for the Defendant, <hi>Barker</hi> Serjeant argued for the Plaintiff; It shall be intended a Limitation and not a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for a Will shall have favorable conſtruction according to the intent of the Deviſor, for a Joyntenant may deviſe to his Companion, 49. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and <hi>Fitz. Na. Bre. Ex gravi querela,</hi> laſt caſe. A man deviſes Land to his Wife for life upon condition, that if he marry, that it should remain over to his Son in tayl, and the Wife marries, and the Son in remainder ſues <hi>(Ex Gravi querela)</hi> by which it appeares that it was a Limitation and not a condition, and 34, <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. deviſe was to one for life upon condition that if his Sonn diſturbed him, that then it should remaine over in taile, upon diſturbance; he in Remainder in tail brings <hi>Formedon,</hi> by which it appears it was a Limitation, and with that agrees all the Juſtices in 29 <hi>Aſſiſarum</hi> 17. And <hi>Wellock</hi> and <hi>Hamonds Caſe</hi> cited in <hi>Baraſtons</hi> Caſe before, and 18. <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> If Land be limited to no third perſon by the Deviſe, then the Heir shall enter for breaking the condition, and alſo he ſaid, that it appears by <hi>Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and 13 <hi>H.</hi> 7 23. and 24, and 20 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and 17 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 343. the Earle of <hi>Arundells,</hi> caſe which conditioneth that Tenant in taile shall not alien, ſtandeth with his Eſtate, but not with Fee ſimple, and ſo it is adjudged in <hi>Nowes</hi> and <hi>Scholaſticas</hi> Caſe, which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:41383:171"/>
in the point, which as he ſaith cannot be anſwered, and the Words of the Condition are not that her Eſtate taile shall ceaſe as if shee had been dead, but as if she had not been named, which is not ſo repugnant or abſurd as the other, and this compared to 34 <hi>Ed,</hi> 3. Where the Eſtate was limited till it was diſturbed.</p>
                     <p>And he alſo argued, that the agreement of the Wife ſhall be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture notwithſtanding the coverture, for when the Eſtate is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſuch condition, he which hath the eſtate ſhall take it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the condition; as if two Leſſees are, and one Seals the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpart onely, yet the other ſhall be bound by the Covenants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it; and 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 31. a Woman diſavows to be Executor, notwithſtanding that ſhee was marryed, and if <hi>Precipe</hi> had been brought againſt the Husband and Wife, the default of the Husband ſhall binde the Wife, and ſo ſhe ſhall be puniſhed for waſte made during the coverture, and ſo concluded, and prayed judgement for the Plaintiff: <hi>Foſter</hi> Juſtice, that an Eſtate of Free-hold shall not ceaſe by agreement or concluſion without entry, for it is a matter of Inheritance and Free-hold, and it is not like to 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 31. which concerns Chattels and Goods; and <hi>Walmeſley</hi> Juſtice accorded with him: <hi>Warburton</hi> Juſtice, it hath been adjudged in <hi>Scholaſticas</hi> Caſe, that the condition was good, and therefore he would not deliver his opinion without argument; <hi>Coke</hi> cheif Juſtice, that the agreement is void to a Woman married, for then ſhe was married to a Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, whom in her life ſhe could not contradict, and a Deviſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Condition, that if ſhe conclude or agree, as this Caſe is, is void, for it is a bare communication, upon which the Inheritance doth not depend, and ſo he ſaid, it hath been twice adjudged, 6 in <hi>Corbets Caſe, and Germins Caſe, and Arſcots Caſe, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chells Caſe in Littleton,</hi> it was upon condition that he ſhould not alien, and this was adjudged to be void; but yet if the condition were if he alien, and not if go about or intend, or conclude, or agree as in the caſe at the Bar, for there is no ſuch caſe in all our Bookes as this.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, For that, that the Words are, if they do any act, that then the Eſtate ſhall ceaſe, and this is repugnant, for when the Act is done, then the Eſtate tayle is Barred, and cannot ceaſe, but if it had been but a Feoffment, then the right had remained, and he ſaid that ſuch a condition had been void before the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Donis Conditionalibus,</hi> when it was but Fee ſimple Conditionall, be it a Condition or a Limitation, and he ſaid that <hi>Scholasticas</hi> Caſe is of Fine which is only diſcontinuance till the Proclamations are paſt, and if dead before may be avoided by <hi>Remitter,</hi> in <hi>Germins and Arſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotts</hi> Caſe, the Condition was, that if he go about or indeavour, and this was adjudged to be void, though that it be in deviſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:41383:172"/>
of the uncertainty, and he ſaid that the (agreement or conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) is ſo uncertain, and may be well compared to that, for here the Eſtate ſhall ceaſe by the agreement, as well as it may ceaſe by the going about, alſo he ſeemed that the Freehold cannot ceaſe without entry, for if uſe cannot ceaſe without entry as he intends, much leſſe a Free-hold cannot, though it be by Deviſe, and he ſeemed that it ſhall be no limitation, but a Condition, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment accordingly, if cauſe be not ſhewed the next Tearm, and in <hi>Trinity</hi> Tearme then next inſuing this Caſe was argued againe by <hi>Dodridge</hi> Serjeant of the King for the Plaintiff, and he ſaid that there are three queſtions to be diſputed. Firſt, If it be a good limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Secondly, If the recovery be a breach of that. Thirdly, Admitting that it may be broken, if the agreement of the Husband and the wife ſhall be ſaid to breake it, and to the firſt he ſeemed that it is a limitation and not a condition, and ſuch a Limitation that well might be with the Law, and that it is a Limitation it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in <hi>Scholaſticas</hi> Caſe, Commentaries, and the reaſon of the Judgment there is, that if the intent of the Deviſor appears, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſhall take benefit of that and not the Heire, that then it shall be but a limitation and not a Condition, and he in remainder shall take benefit of that, and for that in the principall caſe <hi>Mary</hi> the Eldeſt Daughter, to whom the Remainder was limited, shall take benefit of that, and with this agrees the caſe of <hi>Fitz. Na. Bre. Ex gravi querela</hi> laſt caſe, that if a man deviſes Lands to his Wife for life, upon condition that if she marry that the Land shall remain over, and after she marryes, and he in Remainder ſues by <hi>(Gravi quere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la)</hi> by which it appears that it is a limitation and not a condition, and with this agrees 2. and 3. <hi>P. and M. 127. Dyer, Jasper Warrens</hi> Caſe, where a man deviſes land to his Wife for life, upon conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to bring up his Sonn, Remainder over, and agreed to be a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and not a condition, and ſo he concluded this firſt point, that it is a limitation and not a condition. Secondly, that it is a lawfull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, for there is not any repugnancy in that, as it is in <hi>Corebts</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cited, for there are no words of going about, for he agreed that this is abſolutely uncertain and void, and ſo is <hi>Germin</hi> &amp; <hi>Arſcots</hi> caſe, where ther is not only a going about, but repugnant going about for he ought to go about and before diſcontinuance, and then his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate shall be void from the time of the going about and before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance, but here it is upon (conclude and agree) plainly and apparently, and conclude and agree is iſſuable, and a Jury may try that, and it will not invegle any man, but the Law will not ſuffer Iſſue upon ſuch uncertainty as going about or purpoſing, but Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements and Surrenders are but agreements, and yet are Iſſuable: And ſo in the principall caſe, and in <hi>Mildmayes</hi> Caſe 6 <hi>Coke</hi> it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:41383:172"/>
that a condition that a Tenant in taile shall not ſuffer a Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very is void, for Recovery is not reſtrained by the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> 2. but here it is not ſo but in generall, that he shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude or agree to alien or diſcontinue, but that which cannot be a condition good in the particular, may be good in the generall, as <hi>Littletons</hi> Caſe, gift in taile upon condition that he should not ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en is good, otherwiſe of Fee ſimple, with which 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 11. and 13 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 23. 24. accordingly.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That it is a breach of the limitation, Condition, that alienation and diſcontinuance be by Recovery, which is a lawfull act, and it is a priviledge incident to the Eſtate taile, and though that the agreement was made by the Husband and the Wife during the Coverture, and ſo ſhould be if the Husband and the Wife had levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Fine, ſee 10 <hi>H. 7, 13. Condition,</hi> that if the condition had been expreſſed that they ſhould not levy a Fine had been void, and here this verball agreement betwixt the Husband and the Wife and the third perſon ſhall be for Forfeiture of their Eſtates, for this is the agreement of the Wife as well as of the Husband, as it appears by <hi>Becwithes</hi> Caſe 2. <hi>Coke</hi> before cited, where the Husband and the Wife agree to levy a Fine, and that the Fine shall be to the uſe of the Connuſee, this is good declaration of the uſe, though that it be of the Land of the Wife and during the Coverture, and cannot be avoided by the Wife after the death of her Husband, for it was the agreement of the Wife, though it be not by any Indenture to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the uſe of the Fine, ſo many acts in the Country made by the Husband and the Wife, shall be intended the act of the Wife, as well as of the Husband, as in the 17 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 9.

that, and as the Statute of <hi>Weſtminster</hi> 2. divides eſtate tayl and Fee ſimple, So may cuſtome of a Mannor as well as cuſtome make an eſtate at will, which is perſonall and determines by the death of any of the parties to diſcend, and as well as the cuſtome of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> (of not moving things fixed) is created by cuſtome, as well may <hi>Formedon</hi> be created by Cuſtome, and alſo the Statute is, that gives <hi>Cui in vita,</hi> extends to a Copy-hold, ſo the Statute of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, as it appeares by <hi>Brooke,</hi> Limitation, 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6.

Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Brevium. 12. C.</hi> where it is ſayd, that Copy-Tenants, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-holders, or Tenants by copy, is but a new Terme found, for of auncient times they were called Tenants in Villenage or of baſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure, as this alſo appeares by the old Tenures, by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares that then they were called and named Tenants, which held in Villenage or of baſe tenure, and <hi>Bracton,</hi> booke 2. chap. 8. in the end ſpeakes of that, and calls them Villaines, Sokemaines, and that if ſuch a Tenant will transfer his Tenement, let it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered into the hand of the Lord or his Steward, and he wrote immediately before the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. and agreed with <hi>Fitz.

baſe Tenure, and <hi>Lambert</hi> calles it <hi>Folkland,</hi> by which and ſeverall names he ſaith, that the baſeneſſe of the Eſtate appeares, And to the eſtate he ſaith that originally it was but at the will of the Lord, though that it be according to the Cuſtome of the Mannor, So that the Lord cannot put him out if he performe the ſervices. And the Regiſter doth not reſpect him, for he hath not framed any Originall for him, to give him remedy by the Common Law, but only in the Court of the Lord, though that erronious Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be given: Alſo he cannot preſcribe but in the name of the Lord, as it appeares by 18. <hi>Ed. 3. Fitz.</hi> preſcription, that ſuch eſtates which are incident to Fee ſimple, as Dower, not Tenants by the Curtiſie cannot be derived out of this without Cuſtome, nor that warranted. So that his reputation appeares by his name and alſo by his nature: Alſo he intended that the makers of the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2, did not intend that the Statute should extend to this, for it is, <hi>Oppoſitum in Objecto,</hi> for Cuſtome is without time of memory. And the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. was made 13. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. the beginning of which every one knowes. Alſo the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. doth not extend to any Lands, but thoſe which the Tenant might have aliened before the Statute. But the Copy-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had not any power to alien, for the Lord ought to be his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument and hand, as <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith, to alien, transfer he cannot, but by the hands of the Lord, and it muſt be reſtored to the Lord, the words of the Statute are, The will of the giver in the Charter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the Statute intends ſuch Lands which may paſſe by Deed and Fine, and deviſe his Deeds, and the Deed extends to them, for a Fine is <hi>Chirograph,</hi> and deviſe to be made by copy of Court Roll is not ſo, for that is only of Acts made in the Court of the Lord, it cannot be within the Statute, for Copy-hold ought to be held of the Lord, and Tenant in tayl shall hold of the giver, and ſo cannot a Copy-holder, which hath ſo baſe an eſtate. And if this ſhall be ſo, theſe miſcheifes will inſue. That is, that this baſe eſtate ſhould be of better ſecurity, then any eſtate at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, for Fine ſhall not be a Barr of that, for it cannot be levied of that, alſo Recovery cannot be ſuffered of that, for there cannot be a Recovery in value neither of Lands at the Common Law, neither of Cuſtomary Lands, for they cannot be transferred but by the hands of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>And to <hi>Littleton</hi> he agreed, and alſo, 4 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. which agrees with this, where it is ſaid that at <hi>Steben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:41383:175"/>
for this cannot be held of any, but only of the Lord, and to the others, this Eſtate doth not lye in Tenure, and yet he agreed that of ſome things which did not lye in Tenure, Eſtate Tail may be, but Land may be intailed, but Copy-hold Eſtate is ſo baſe, that an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate tail cannot be derived out of it, ſo that though that cuſtome may make an Eſtate to one and the Heires of his Body, yet this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an Eſtate taile but Fee-ſimple conditionall, and alſo he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that they might have <hi>Formedon in Diſcender,</hi> but it is the ſame <hi>Formedon,</hi> which was before the <hi>Statute,</hi> as if Tenant in Fee-ſimple conditionall before the <hi>Statute,</hi> would alien before iſſue, but it was no Eſtate taile, with the priviledges of an Eſtate taile before the <hi>Statute,</hi> and to the other matter of Surrender, that is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance of the parties which is an Eſtate taile, that doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Court, as it appears by the <hi>Lord Barkleys</hi> Caſe in the Commentaries, where the Eſtate pleaded ſeverally by the parties is not traverſed by any of them, and ſo concludes, and prayes Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this caſe was argued again in <hi>Trinity Tearme</hi> next enſuing <hi>by Montague</hi> the Kings Serjeant for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> and he ſaid, that there are three queſtions in the caſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If Copy-hold land may be intailed. Secondly, Admitting that it may be intailed, if Surrender makes diſcontinuance. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, If it ſhall be Remitter; and to the firſt, he ſeemed that it might be intailed and that it ſhall be within the Statute of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> 2. And firſt for the Antiquity of that, he ſaid that <hi>Littleton</hi> placed that amongſt his Eſtates of Free-hold, and hath been time out of minde, and is a primitive Eſtate, and not derived out of the Eſtate of the Lord, and the Lord is not the Creator of that, but the means to convey that after that it is cerated, and what is created then ſhall have all the priviledges and Benefits which are incident to it, and ſhall be nurſed by the cuſtome, and is time out of minde, and the Law alwaies takes notice of it, and he cited, 24 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 323. by <hi>Hankf.

Bre. 12 C. and Brownes</hi> Caſe 4. <hi>Coke,</hi> which is not ſimply an Eſtate at the will of the Lord, but at the VVill of the Lord according to the cuſtome of the Mannor, and when it hath gained the reputation of Free-hold, then it ſhall be dircted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of the Common Law, <hi>and 2. and 3. P. and Ma. Dier</hi> 114. 60. allow Copy-hold Eſtate to be intailed, and he ſaith, That no <hi>Statute</hi> hath more liberall expoſition <hi>then the Statute of Weſtminſter 2. 45. Ed.</hi> 3. Incumbrance ſhall not charge the Iſſue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, alſo a Copy-holder ſhall have a <hi>Cui in vita,</hi> alſo a Copy-hold is within the <hi>Statute</hi> of Limitation; and ſo upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of pretenced rights: And it is alway intended when a <hi>Statute</hi> ſpeakes of Lands and Tenements, that Copy-hold Lands ſhall be within that: And he ſaith, That all the Objections which have been
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41383:176"/>
made of the contrary part are anſwered in <hi>Heydons</hi> Caſe, but he relyed upon that, that every reall Inheritance is within the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Westminſter 2. 4 Ed. 2. Formedon</hi> lyeth of Copy-hold Land, 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 46. Eſtate tayle is of a Corrody and office, which proves, that Copy-hold is a reall Inheritance, and for that ſhall be within the <hi>Statute, 46 Ed.</hi> 3. 21. Gavelkinde Land may be intailed, 6 <hi>Rich. 2. Avowry 2. 8. Rich.</hi> 2. 26. Copy-holder ſhall be charged with Fees of a Knight at Parliament, 22 <hi>and 23. Eliz. Dier</hi> 373. 13. Lands in ancient Demeſne were intayled, and he ſaid that the reaſon is, that for that it is Inheritance and time hath applyed them to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and ſo concluded, and prayed Judgment for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hutton</hi> Serjeant argued for the Plaintiff, that Copy-hold Lands cannot be intailed, for that is but a cuſtomary Eſtate; and the Law doth not take any notice of it, but onely according to Cuſtome, for there were no Eſtates tayle before the Statute, for then all were Fee ſimple abſolute or conditionall; that is, either implyed, or by limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which cannot be of an Eſtate tayle, which is not within the Statute of <hi>Westminſter</hi> 2. for no Actions are maintainable by that, but thoſe which are by the Cuſtome, and a Writ of falſe Judgment: See <hi>Fitzherberts Natura brevium, 12. 13 Ed. 3. F. Preſcription</hi> 29. that it hath no Incidents, which are incident to Eſtates at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law without Cuſtome, as Dower: See <hi>Revetts</hi> Caſe, and ſo is Tenancy by the Curteſie, and there ſhall be no diſcent of that to take away Entry, and ſo of other derivatives: And he ſeemed that it is not within the <hi>Statute</hi> for three reaſons apparent within the <hi>Statute.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Firſt, That it is hard that Givers shall be barred of their reverſions; but in caſe of Copy-holds, the Giver hath no remedy to compell the Lord to admit him after the Eſtate tayle ſpent, but onely <hi>Subpena,</hi> and in this Caſe the Lord may releive himſelfe for the loſſe of his ſervices, for that the <hi>Statute</hi> provides no remedy for him.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That the <hi>Statute</hi> doth not intend any Lands, but thoſe of which there is actuall reverſion or remainder, and thoſe which paſſe by Deed; ſo that the will of the Giver expreſsed in the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may be obſerved, and of which there may be a ſubdiviſion, as Lord, Meſne, and Tenant, for there shall be alwayes a reverſion of the Eſtate tayle, and the Donee shall hold of the Donor and not of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it ſeems that the <hi>Statute</hi> doth not intend to provide for any, but thoſe for whom the VVrit in the <hi>Formedon</hi> ordained by the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> lyes, and agreed that for Offices and ſuch like, <hi>Formedon</hi> lyeth, if the party will admit Eſtate tayle to be diſcontinued.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the <hi>Statute</hi> intends thoſe things, of which a Fine may be levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the <hi>Statute</hi> provides, that (the Fine in his owne right should
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41383:176"/>
be nothing) but by Copy-holder Fine cannot be levied, and for that he ſhall not be within the <hi>Statute,</hi> and if the Words do not extend to that, then the Equity of the <hi>Statute</hi> ſhall not extend to that, and he ſaid that Copy-hold is not within any of the <hi>Statutes,</hi> which are made in the ſame yeare, as the <hi>Statute which gives Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git,</hi> and ſuch like, and to <hi>Littleton</hi> that an Eſtate by copy, is where Lands are given in Fee-ſimple, Fee-taile, and that <hi>Formedon</hi> lies for that with which agrees 10 <hi>Ed. 2. Formedon</hi> 55. It ſeems that the Eſtate taile here mentioned, ſhall be intended Fee-ſimple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall at the Common Law, and the <hi>Formedon in Diſcender</hi> which was at the Common Law, for alienation before Iſſue: And ſo <hi>Littleton</hi> ſhall be intended, For the Eſtate is within time of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; ſee <hi>Heydons</hi> caſe, that a Copy-hold Eſtate is an Eſtate in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the <hi>Statute of 31 H.</hi> 8. And <hi>Manwood</hi> there ſaid, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch the Eſtate of that is created by cuſtome, and the Eſtate taile is created by <hi>Statute,</hi> yet it ſhall not be within the <hi>Statute,</hi> and he ſaid that the caſe of 15 <hi>H. 8. B.</hi> Copy of <hi>Court</hi> 24. is repugnant in it ſelf in the words of <hi>Formedon,</hi> for he ſaith, though that <hi>Forme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> was given by <hi>Statute,</hi> and was no otherwiſe in <hi>Diſcender,</hi> yet now this Writ lies at the Common Law, and it ſhall be intended, that this hath been a cuſtome there, time out of minde, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo he concluded, and prayed Judgment for the Plaintiff.</p>

Caſe, 5. <hi>Coke 28. b.</hi> and in 4. <hi>Coke 60. a. Sadlers</hi> Caſe, upon which he infers, that if an Executor firſt ſatisfie a Statute or a Recogniſance before a Judgement, that this ſhall be a <hi>Devaſtavit,</hi> as well as if he ſatisfies an Obligation, firſt as in <hi>Trewynyards</hi> Caſe, and that when the Plaintiff which hath Judgement, the Executor may aid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by <hi>Audit a querela</hi> by this matter ſubſequent: <hi>Quere</hi> of <hi>Doctor Druryes</hi> Caſe, as in 7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 42. in <hi>Detinue</hi> againſt <hi>Gamiſhe,</hi> and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had for the Plaintiff. If the Judgement be reverſed, reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be made to every one which hath loſſe. So here by <hi>Audita Querela,</hi> if the Executrix hath not more then was taken in execution by the Statute, and it ſeemes to him that the Judgement in the <hi>Scire Facias</hi> ſhall not be a Barr in this Action, for the Judgment remaines, Executrix and the Plaintiff may have Action of Debt upon that. But of the contrary, if the Plaintiff had brought Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Debt upon the Judgement and had been barred, then ſhall be barred in <hi>Scire Facias</hi> alſo; But the Plaintiff this notwithſtanding, may have <hi>Scire Facias</hi> upon ſurmiſe, that there are new aſſets, come to the hands of the Executor, and ſo he concluded and praied Judgement for the Plaintiff. <hi>Nicholls</hi> Serjeant for the Defendant relies only upon the Judgement had upon the <hi>Scire Facias,</hi> and that till that he Defeated, the Plaintiff cannot maintaine Action of Debt, for the Action of Debt is nothing but demanding of Execution, and for that till the firſt Judgement be Defeated the Plaintiff hath no remedy at the Common Law. All things which barr the Execution of the Judgement in <hi>Scire Facias,</hi> theſe ſhall be Barrs in an Action of Debt, as in <hi>Baxters</hi> Caſe here laſt adjudged, in an Action upon the Caſe for ſlanderous words, the Defendant pleads that he had juſtified the ſpeaking of theſe words, at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other time in another Action brought againſt him, and had a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and Judgement upon that, and ſo demands Judgement, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged a good Plea, till the firſt Judgement is reverſed, for Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the ſaying of the Law, and 13. <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 299. 34. in Debt for Coſts recovered in a Writ of entry, the Defendant pleads that the Plaintiff hath ſued an <hi>Elegit,</hi> which was Executed, and a good Barr in an Action of Debt, and ſo 1. and 2. <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>M. Dyer</hi> 107. 24. In Debt for Dammages recovered in Aſſiſe, the Defendant pleads in Barr, that after the verdict given and before Judgement, the Plaintiff entred into the Land, and there no Judgement is given. But it ſeemes if the Plaintiff fayl of Courſe that the Common Law preſcribes, that then he ſhall not have Execution, (for of thoſe things which rightly are Acted let there be Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) but if the Defendant in the firſt Action had pleaded a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, and Judgement was given upon that againſt him, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not plead that againe, (for it runs into the thing Judged,) 34.

                        <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. in Debt againſt an Executor, and part of the aſſetts found, the Plaintiff cannot have new <hi>Scire Facias</hi> without Averrment that there are new aſſetts, and 34. <hi>H.</hi> 6. Action with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment that there are aſſets, and Judgement good both waies, and preſidents ſhewed of both Courts. And he intended that the Executor could not have helped himſelfe by <hi>Audita Querela,</hi> unleſſe he feares to be impleaded, but after Execution he cannot have Reſtitution, and ſo concluded and praied Judgement for the Defendant. <hi>Coke</hi> cheife Juſtice, that there cannot be a <hi>Devaſtavit</hi> in the Wife, unleſſe that it be voluntary payment by her, for the Statute of 23. <hi>H.</hi> 8. gives preſent Execution of a Statute <hi>Staple</hi> without <hi>Scire Facias.</hi> So that the Wife had no time to plead the Judgement, and for that this unvoluntary Act, ſhall not be a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtavit,</hi> for ſhe is no agent, but only a ſufferer. And at the Common Law if the Plaintiff hath Judgement in an Action of Debt after the yeare he hath no remedy, but new Originall, and this miſcheife was remedied by the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which gives <hi>Scire Facias</hi> in place of new Action. But it ſeemes to him that the Barr in the <hi>Scire Facias</hi> ſhall remaine good Barr, till it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed, as in 2 <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. A man hath election to have action of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,</hi> or action of <hi>Treſpaſſe,</hi> and he brings his action of <hi>Detinue,</hi> and the Plaintiff wages his Law, and after brings an action of <hi>Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe,</hi> and the firſt Nonſuit pleaded in Barr, and adjudged a good Barr, 12 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. accordingly: <hi>Foſter, Walmeſley,</hi> and <hi>Warburton,</hi> agreed without any doubt, but they ſayd, that if the firſt execution had been had by Covin, then it ſhould have been otherwiſe.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, For that he gives no Intereſt, and for that it cannot be upon condition; for it is but a bare aſſent.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, His Anceſtors held the ſame Land by the payment of the Rent and making of their Services, and it is reaſon that the Rent ſhould be payd, and the Services performed, and for that though that he ſhall have his age for the Land, yet for the Rent he ſhall not have his age, and though that it is agreed in 32 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. That he ſhall have his age <hi>(In per que ſervitia)</hi> yet after his full age the Grantee ſhall diſtraine for all the arrerages due from the firſt, ſo that the Attornement is no prejudice for this Infant, and he is in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe which ſhall be compellable to attorn, ſee 41 <hi>Ed. 3. age 23. 26 Ed 3. 32. 32 Ed.</hi> 3. and 31 <hi>Ed. 3.

                        <hi>DOdridge</hi> Serjeant of the King argued for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> he ſaith that there are two Copies, firſt that a Copy-holder for life under a 100. <hi>l.</hi> may nominate his Succeſſor. Secondly, That ſuch Copy-holder after ſuch nomination may cut down all the Trees growing upon his Copy-hold and ſell them, and he ſaith that it hath been adjudged that the cuſtome that Copy-holder for life may ſell the Trees growing upon his Copy-hold is void, between <hi>Popham and Hill, Hillary 45 Eliz. in this Court,</hi> ſo if the firſt cuſtome doth not make difference by the nomination, the ſecond is reſolved to be void, and it ſeemes to him that the firſt cuſtome doth not make difference, and to the objection that the firſt cuſtome hath been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to be good between <hi>Bale and Crab,</hi> he ſaith that the cuſtome adjudged, and this cuſtome as it is found differs in many points. Firſt, It was found that every Copy-holder for life ſolely ſeiſed without Remainder, but here is ſole Tenant in poſſeſſion, and this may be where there is a Remainder, ſo that uncertainty in this makes the cuſtome void, as in 6 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. cuſtome that an Infant at the age of diſcretion may alien is void for uncertainty, alſo in the caſe here it is found, that the Copy-holder may name who ſhall be next Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Lord, and doth not ſay to whom the nomination ſhall be made, but in the firſt caſe the cuſtome is found to be, that the nomination ought to be to the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the preſence of two Copy-holders, alſo in the firſt it is found, that if they cannot agree of the Fine, that the Homage ſhall aſſeſs it; but in this cuſtome here found there is not any mention of that he ought to ſeek to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and doth not ſay at what court, the which ought to be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in certain, as it is reſolved in <hi>Penimans Caſe, 5 Coke</hi> 84. Where cuſtome that a Feoffment ought to be inrolled, is expreſſed, ſhall be inrolled at the next court, alſo in the firſt caſe to be found that after the Fine is payd or offered, he which is named ſhall be admitted, and here is not any mention of that, ſo that he concluded that this is a new cuſtome, and not the ſame cuſtome which was in queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Bayle and Colepit,</hi> alſo it is found that the trees were cut im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after nomination of a new Tenant, and before any admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or Fine payd for him; ſo that inſomuch that the Benefit was not equall as well as to the Lord as to the Tenant, as in 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 28. and 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 80. For plowing and turning upon the Land of another, for that the cuſtome ſhall be void. And to the ſecond cuſtome alſo it
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:41383:179"/>
ſeems, that that is voyd and unreaſonable. Firſt, for that when any is alledged in the cuſtome, that is inconvenient, though that it be not miſcheivous, yet the cuſtome ſhall be void, as in 4. <hi>Aſſiſarum</hi> 27. in <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> brought againſt an Abbot, which pleads cuſtome, that all the houſes of the South ſide of the ſtreet ſhall be deviſable, and he claimes by force of a Deviſe made according to that cuſtome and adjudged that the cuſtome is not good, for it is inconvenient that in one ſelf ſame ancient Town one houſe ſhall be deviſable and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not, and upon that the Plea was amended, ſo here, cuſtome that a Copy-holder may ſell all the Trees is inconvenient, for it doth not appeare that this Cuſtome extended to any other but to him: Secondly this Cuſtome is againſt the Common Wealth, for every Cuſtome ought to have preſervation and maintenance, and that ſhall not be here, for when one Copy-holder hath ſold all the Trees, the Succeſſor ſhall not have any Boots nor Fire, and ſo by the ſame reaſon he may pull down the houſe. And ſo this tends to deſtruction, and reſts in the will of a man if he will diſtroy or not. And this is inconvenient that ſuch power ſhould be given to one, which hath but an eſtate for life, as in 14. <hi>Ed. 3. Barr</hi> 277. Copy-holder pleads Cuſtome of a Mannor, that that Copy-holder which comes firſt after a windfall falne, ſhall have it, and reſolved to be void Cuſtome, for that it reſts in the will of a man if he will finde that or not. So in 5. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 9. Cuſtome that if one find Beaſts doing Dammage that he may diſtraine them, and have foure pence for his Dammages, and adjudged void Cuſtome, for the Dammages are nncertaine, and for that it is no reaſon that the Fine ſhall be certaine, and 19. <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 358. 46. Cuſtome that all Deviſes and Leaſes, granted for more then ſix yeares are meerly void forthwith, is a void Cuſtome, becauſe contrary to common reaſon, and the liberty of one which hath Fee ſimple. So 2 <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. 24. Cuſtome that the Tenants of the Mannor ſhall not uſe their Common till the Lord put in his Beaſts, is void, for it ſhould not depend on the Will of the Lord; So in the principall caſe the Lord cannot grant Copy-hold Eſtate in reverſion, for it depends upon the Nomination of his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and for that the Cuſtome ſhall be void.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The Copy-holder hath preſcribed to do a thing which is contrary to his Eſtate, and doth not cohere with his Eſtate, that is, that Leſſee for life ſhall cut the Trees, for he hath but a ſpeciall property in that, and not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <hi>Haughton</hi> Serjeant ſeemeth the contrary for the Defendant, and he agreed that Cuſtomes ought to be reaſonable, and if they be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally inconvenient, they cannot be reaſonable; and to the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, to prove that it is a new Cuſtome; that is, that it is found that he is onely Tenant in poſſeſſion, without ſaying, Without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder, as it was in the firſt Caſe; to that he thought if it were true, that the Copy-holder hath ſuch priviledge that he might no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate his Succeſſor, it is not materiall, and to the leſſening of the Fine, that is found very certaine, for he that is nominated at the firſt requires admittance, and if the Lord refuſe that he ſhall be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for ſuch a Fine that the Homage Aſſeſs, and ſo it is found, and that is very certaine, and the rather for that, that this is a ſpeciall Verdict.</p>
                     <p>Alſo he agreed as before, That Cuſtome ought to be reaſonable, and if it be generally inconvenient, though it be not miſcheivous, yet it ſhall not be good; and to the Caſe of 40 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 37. Cuſtome to deviſe the Tenements on the South ſide of the Street, is not good, for that, that Cuſtome cannot be in one particular place certaine; and alſo he agreed the Caſe of Windfall, for that tended to charge the Lord, 3 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 299. 57. 58. Cuſtome to have Herriot the beſt Beaſt, and if that be put out of the way before ſeiſure, then the Lord may ſeiſe and take the Beaſt of any other mans there ariſing and lying downe; to his owne proper uſe, and the cuſtome held voyd and unreaſonable: So the cuſtome in 20 <hi>H.</hi> 7. to have ſo much
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:41383:180"/>
for every Pound-breach is voyd; but this cuſtome is meerly between the Lord and Tenant, and the cuſtome hath made that diſcendable Inheritance, and alſo may have reaſonable beginning, and the Lord hath benefit for that; that is, his Fine for the admittance of him which is nominated; and cuſtome hath created other Eſtates, as Grant to him and his, is good by the cuſtome, and ſo the Caſes of 21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. and 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. before cyted, for the turning of Plough upon the Land of his Neighbour: So the cuſtome if the Lord feed the Beaſts of his Tenant that he may Fold them; and ſo he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the firſt cuſtome to make nomination is good; and to the ſecond cuſtome, he agreed that bare Copy-holder for life, could not Preſcribe to cut and ſell all the Trees, no more then cuſtome that Tenant for life may deviſe, as 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. But here the Tenant hath perpetuity in his Eſtate, and may nominate his Succeſſor, and as well as the Common Law allows Tenant after poſſibility of Iſſue extinct, to make waſte; ſo may cuſtome allow Tenant for life with ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, power to cut and ſell the Trees: Alſo he intended, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the cuſtome not good, that yet the Copy-holder hath nor forfeited his Eſtate, for the Trees and the Mannor are granted by ſeverall Grants, and for that, though that they are by one ſelfe ſame Deed, yet by that the Trees are ſevered from the Mannor, and the Trees are the cauſe of the forfeiture, and they are no parcell of the Mannor, as in 31 <hi>Edw. 3. Aſſiſ.</hi> 441. by ſale of a Caſtle the ſervices are extinct.</p>
                     <p>So here the forfeiture cannot accrue to the Mannor, when that commeth by reaſon of Trees, which are ſevered by reaſon of ſeverall Grants; and he thought that the Grant ſhall be taken more ſtrong, againſt him which made it; as if a man in the Premiſes give Fee-ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to have in tayl, the Eſtate tayl ſhall be precedent, and the Fee-ſimple depending upon that; ſo if a man have the next avoydance of a Church, and the Church becomes voyd. and after he purchaſe the Advowſon, yet the Preſentation remaines as it was before, for that is the beſt thing, and ſo it is reſolved in <hi>Herlackendens</hi> Caſe, 4 <hi>Coke 63. b.</hi> That if a man makes a Leaſe for yeares of Land, except the Trees, and after grants the Trees to the Leſsee, that the Trees are not reunited to the Land, and ſo he concluded that it ſhall be no forfeiture, and prayed Judgment for the Defendant; and this Caſe was argued againe, <hi>Michaelmas, 9 Jacobi,</hi> by <hi>Shirley</hi> for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, <note place="margin">Shirley.</note> that the firſt cuſtome was voyd, inſomuch that he claimed to doe a greater thing then his Eſtate would warrant, as in 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. Cuſtome that if one Pawne the Goods of another, that he which hath them Pawned may keep them whoſoever they were, is not good, as Cuſtome that the Tenant in tayle may deviſe, is voyd, for his Eſtate will not warrant it, and it is prejudice to the Tenant in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:41383:180"/>
So Cuſtome that Copy-holder ſhall have Common, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Cuſtome, that none ſhall put in his Beaſts till the Lord put in his, 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 24. Alſo there is no Fine Limited to be tendred by the Tenant, or to be demanded by the Lord: And if a Copy-holder refuſe to pay his Fine it is a Forfeyture, and if the Cuſtome do not provide for the Fine of the Lord as for the Copy-holder, the Cuſtome ſhall be void: Alſo here cannot be admittance, for <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith, that the ſole meanes to transfer Copy-hold is by Surrender. And here if the Cuſtome ſhould be good, the copy-hold ſhould be transferred by Nomination only, and ſo the Lord ſhould be Defeated of his Fine, and it ſeemes alſo that the ſecond Cuſtome is void, for it is contrary to the Eſtate of a copy-holder, to ſell all the Trees, but he agreed that he might have Eſtovers for houſeboote and hedgboote, as it was adjudged in <hi>Swayne</hi> and <hi>Becketts</hi> Caſe, and he cited the 19. <hi>aſſiſ.</hi> Where a Commoner made a Leaſe for life, and void, for that that the Eſtate would not ſupport it, 9. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 56. and 11. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 40. Preſcription to ſell Eſtovers is void, for Eſtovers are appropriate to a houſe: And alſo it was adjudged in this Court between <hi>Poltocke</hi> and <hi>Powell,</hi> that a copy-holder for life cannot preſcribe to ſell the Trees, for it is contrary to his Eſtate, as if a Cuſtome be, that if a Feoffor die his Heire within age, that he ſhall be in Ward, as 8. <hi>H.</hi> 6. And he thought that the Nomination was no alteration, for he to whom the Nomination is made, hath only an Eſtate for life, when the Nomination is made, and that doth not warrant the ſale of the Trees, and to the third it ſeemes that the Lord of the Mannor bargaine and ſells the Trees, and after lets the Mannor to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainee for years, and then copy-holder makes waſt, he thought that the Trees were not ſevered from the Mannor, as in 33. <hi>H. 8. 48. Dyer</hi> 2. if a man bargaine and ſell a Mannor, and after in the ſame Deed makes a bargaine and ſale of an Advowſon appendant, this remaines appendant: So if a man bargaine and ſell a Mannor, and alſo the Trees do not paſſe till Livery be made of the Mannor, So if Leſſee for yeares, gives and grants the Land, and makes a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Attorney to make Livery, the tearme paſſes without Livery, and then it is a Forfeyture: And here the Leſſee ſhall have the benefit of Shade and Burrough, and the Trees themſelves during the Tearme, as parcell of the Land, and then when the copy-holder hath done more then his Eſtate will warrant, this is a forfeyture, and the Leſſee ſhall take the advantage of it, and ſo he praied Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Plaintiff: <hi>Harris</hi> for the Defendant that the Cuſtomes are good, but admitting that ſo, yet the Plaintiff ſhall not take <note place="margin">Harris.</note> advantage of it, and he argued that Cuſtome ought to have two properties; firſt reaſonable, ſecondly ought to have time to make
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:41383:181"/>
that perfect, and then ſhall be good, as it appears by the examples of <hi>Littleton, f.</hi> 37. of Burrough <hi>Engliſh</hi> and Gavelkind, and cuſtome may be againſt common right, but not againſt common reaſon, which is the common Law, 8 <hi>Ed. 4. 18. 21 Ed.</hi> 3. 4. And he intended here that the ſecond cuſtome is good, if the firſt be good, for then it is perpetuall Free-hold, and Copy-hold Eſtate of Inheritance is but an Eſtate at will at the Common Law, and yet ſuch Copy-holder may diſpoſe the Trees, as well as cuſtome may create the Eſtate, as well may it give ſuch priviledge, as cuſtome may warrant the taking of Toll for paſſing over the ſoile of another, 22 <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> 58. And ſo cuſtome to have the Foldage of the Beaſts which feeds upon his ſoil is good, but cuſtome for paying the Goods of another is not good, for there is not any recompence, but fiſhing in the Sea and to dig the ſoile ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning for landing of his Nets is good, for this is for the publick good, 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 23. So the cuſtome for turning upon head-land of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is good, and is for the preſervation of Tilling, and alſo it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Lord an Tenant, and ſhall be intended to have a reaſonable beginning for conſideration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That this continues, for he hath Fines and other Services, and yet 3 <hi>Eliz. 199. Dyer.</hi> If the Lord claim Harriot of his Tenant, and if it be Eſloyned, alledge cuſtome, that he may take the Beaſts that he found upon the Land in <hi>Withernam;</hi> and this was adjudged unreaſonable cuſtome, ſo 20 H. 7. 13. Cuſtome to have three ſhillings of a ſtranger for pound-breach is void, but of a Tenant is otherwiſe, for it ſhall be intended to be a lawfull begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 40. So here the beginning ſhal be intended to be lawfull and for valuable conſideration, and for this it ſhall be good; and to the ſecond cuſtome it follows by conſequence to be a good cuſtome, if the firſt should be good, and then to the third he agreed that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyholder cannot make waſt, and if he do it shall be a forefeiture of his Eſtate, as it is ſaid by <hi>Hull,</hi> 9 H. 4, <hi>Waſt</hi> 59. but this ought to be ſuch Waſt that is prejudiciall to the Inheritance, as it is agreed in <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lackendens</hi> caſe, 4 <hi>Coke,</hi> Where it is agreed that the Bargainee hath ſeverall Intereſts in the Land and in the Trees, and by the Writings, by the making of the Leaſe of the Mannor they are not reunited and annexed to the Free-hold again, and then the cutting and ſelling is no prejudice to him in reverſion, and ſo no Waſt to make forfeiture, and ſo he concluded and prayed Judgment for the Defendant and is adjourned, ſee the beginning, <hi>fol.</hi>

                     <p>IN <hi>the Writ of Raviſhment of Ward, between Francis Moore Eſquire Plaintiff,</hi> againſt <hi>Doctor Huſſey</hi> and <hi>Katharine</hi> his Wife, <hi>Robert Wakeman</hi> Clark, and many other Defendants, <hi>Dodridge</hi> the Kings Serjeant argued for the <hi>Defendant</hi> Doctor <hi>Huſſey,</hi> that a marryed Wife is not within the <hi>Statute of Weſtminſter 2. chapter</hi> 35. By which the Writ of <hi>Raviſhment of Ward</hi> is given, that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Statute</hi> was only Treſpaſſe, is by the <hi>Statute</hi> altered in manner and form of proceedings and in penalty of Judgment, and he thought that this Writ being formed upon the <hi>Statute</hi> doth not extend to a married Wife, for by the <hi>Statute</hi> if the <hi>Defendant,</hi> cannot ſatisfie for the marriage he muſt abjure the Realme, or ſhall have perpetuall Impriſonment, which goes neer to every man next unto his Life, the love of his Country and liberty, and thoſe the makers of the <hi>Statute</hi> did not intend againſt a married Wife, and he grounded his argument upon theſe words of the <hi>Statute,</hi> by which it appears that the makers of the <hi>Statute;</hi> did not intend any perſon which had no property in any Goods nor power to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
                     <p>For firſt the <hi>Statute</hi> provides, that if he be able to make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that then he ſhould ſatisfy, if not that then he ſhall abjure the Realme, by which it appears that the <hi>Statute</hi> intends thoſe that have property, and by poſſibility may ſatisfy, but a woman cannot, for her marriage is a gift of all her goods perſonall to her Husband, ſee for that <hi>Fox and Girtbrookes Caſe</hi> Commentaries.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The <hi>Statute</hi> provides new form of proceedings, for if the Ward or any of the parties dy hanging the Writ, the Writ ſhall not abate, but it ſhall be revived by Reſummons, by or againſt the Executors of him that is dead, by this it appears that he which hath no power to make Executors, ſhall not be intended to be within the <hi>Statute,</hi> and a married Wife cannot make a Will, and by conſequence cannot make Executors, ſee <hi>Coke 6. a. Forſe and Hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blins</hi> caſe, 3 <hi>Ed. 3. Deviſe 13. 4 H.</hi> 6. 6. and if the Executors have no aſſets, then the <hi>ſtatute</hi> gives remedy againſt the Heir.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Statute</hi> intends to give action againſt him which may have poſſeſſion of the ward, the which a married Wife cannot have, for her poſſeſſion is to the uſe of the Husband, and by the words of <hi>the statute,</hi> he againſt whom the Action is given ought to be made <hi>Fidei poſſeſſor,</hi> and to the objection, that though that the Wife married cannot by any poſſibility have ſufficient to make ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:41383:182"/>
according to the intent of the <hi>statute,</hi> yet if the Husband hath ſufficient, he shall anſwer for his Wife, as in 48 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 26. and 17 H. 6. A married wife shall be attached by the Goods of the Husband, he ſaith that there the reaſon is, that the Wife is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable by the Husband, but this is only to make him to appear, but he againſt whom the action is given, by this <hi>ſtatute</hi> ought to have property, and in ſuch caſes a married Wife shall not be punished, as in the ſame Parliament <hi>Weſtminſter 2. chapter</hi> 25. Is provided, that if a Diſſeiſor faile of Record that he shall be impriſoned, <hi>in Aſſiſe,</hi> for this is the ſpeedy remedy, but if a married wife pleads a Record and failes of that to the Jury; she shall not be impriſoned, though that the Aſſiſe was brought againſt the Husband and the Wife or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Husband, and the wife is received, ſee 1. 3 <hi>Aſſ. 1 44 aſſ. 3. 17. aſ. 19. 11 H.</hi> 4.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the <hi>statute of Conjunctim Feoffatis, fol.</hi> 99. Which was made in the time of the ſaid King <hi>Ed. 3. in which time the ſtatute of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi> 2. was made, and is contemporary with the ſame <hi>ſtatute,</hi> by which it is provided, that if any plead Joyntenancy, which is found againſt him in the <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> that he shall be impriſoned by the ſpace of a yeare, and 16 <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> 8. Husband pleads Joyntenancy with his wife, and maintaines the Exception which is found againſt them, and reſolved that the Wife ſhould not be impriſoned by this <hi>ſtatute, 21 Aſſiſe 28. 31 Aſſiſe a.</hi> accordingly, and he ſaid there was not any preſident nor Book of Record, by which it appears that a Writ of <hi>Raviſhment</hi> of Ward, was maintained againſt a marryed Wife, for <hi>Raviſhment</hi> after the Coverture, but for <hi>Raviſhment</hi> before the Coverture, ſee 6 and 8. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and to the Objection that the Plaintiff hath election if he will have the ſufficiency come in queſtion, may but admit the Defendants to be ſufficient, and then the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, nor the abjuration shall not be inflicted, as it ſeems to be ſome opinion, 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 52. and to that he ſaith, that the admittance of the parties cannot alter the Law, for if it were not the intent of the makers of the <hi>Statute</hi> that this ſhould extend to the Wife, the admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the parties will not make that extend over the proviſion of that, alſo it ſeems to him that the Verdict is not perfect, for that it is not fonnd by whom the VVard was married, but only that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared marryed, and it ought to be without the conſent of the Plaintiff, and for that it might be that he was marryed by the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, and then there is no cauſe of action, nor to have the value of the marriage, and it appears by 22 <hi>R. 2. Damages</hi> 130, that they ought to inquire by whom he is marryed, and alſo the value of the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and if it doth not appear whether he be married or not, then the Verdict shall be conditionall and the Judgment alſo, and all the Preſidents are, he appears married without the aſſent <hi>of the Plaintiff,</hi>
                        <pb n="93" facs="tcp:41383:182"/>
and ſo he concluded, and prayed that the Judgment might ſtand: <hi>Harris</hi> Serjeant for the Plaintiff prayes Judgment, and he ſuppoſed that it is in the choyce of the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> what Judgment he would <note place="margin">Harris.</note> have, for he ought to have Dammages and the value of the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and it remaines in the diſcretion of the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> what judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he will have (that is) upon the <hi>Statute,</hi> for to have the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhment, or allow the <hi>Defendants</hi> to be ſufficient, and ſo to have judgment for the Damages, and the value of the Marriage, without any Impriſonment or Abjuration; as in 29 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 24. and 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 52. where the queſtion was demanded of the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and in 22 <hi>Rich. 2. Damages 130. Hankford</hi> demanded the queſtion, if the Jury ought to inquire if the <hi>Defendants</hi> were ſufficient or not, and it was reſolved that they need not; and in 34 <hi>H. 8. Trinity, Rot.</hi> 347. there is a Preſident accordingly, where the Husband and the Wife were found guilty; and the Action was founded upon the <hi>Statute,</hi> and <hi>Capias</hi> awarded againſt them both, and to the fayling of the Record, it is reaſon that the Wife ſhould not be impriſoned, for the Pleas are the Pleas of the Husband and his acts, and in the 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4 51. and 21 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 4 in Aſſiſe the Wife was received, and voucheth a Record, and failed, and no judgment upon that againſt the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and the Wife was impriſoned; and ſo upon Allegation of Joyntenancy, the Wife was impriſoned; and ſo he concluded, and prayed judgment for the <hi>Plaintiff;</hi> and at another day the Caſe was argued againe by <hi>Montague</hi> the Kings Serjeant for the <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Montague.</note> that a marryed Wife was not within the <hi>Statute of Weſtminſter 2. Chap.</hi> 35. And he ſayd, that the true courſe for underſtanding the <hi>Statute,</hi> is to conſider three things:</p>
                     <p>Firſt the Common Law before the making of that Statute:</p>
                     <p>Secondly the miſcheife that the Statute intended to remedy:</p>
                     <p>Thirdly againſt what perſons the Statute intended to remedy ſuch miſcheifes: And to the firſt he intended that at the Common Law, before the making of the Statute, the Remedy for Raviſhment of Ward, was an Action of Treſpaſſe, as it appeares by <hi>Fitz. Na. Bre.</hi> And then it was queſtioned if the Plaintiff should recover the Body without Dammages, or Dammages only without the Body. See 9. <hi>Ed. 4. 48. Ed.</hi> 3. 20. 27. H. 6. And then there was no greater punishment, nor other remedy for the taking of the Ward, then of other goods, and for the remedy of that, the Statute of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter 2. chap.</hi> 35. was made, by which it is provided, that if the Raviſher reſtore the Ward unmarried, then the Plaintiff ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover only Dammages for the Ravishment, and not the value of the Ward: But if the Ward be married, then the Guardian shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the value of the marriage, and if he shall not ſatisfie, then he shall abjure the Kiugdome, or have perpetuall Impriſonment,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41383:183"/>
and the punishments inflicted by the Statute, being ſo penall: Then the perſons which are within the Statute are conſiderable, for in all penall Lawes, the perſons and the penallties are the things to be conſidered, and to the perſons this Statute ſaith, that one for anothers Fault is not to be puniſhed, and he ſaid, this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Dammages, as well as to Impriſonment, and it is not a loſt caſe, and the Plaintiff without remedy, for Action of Treſpaſſe lies againſt the Husband at the Common Law, for, for all Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes at the Common Law done by a married Wife, the Husband ſhall be punished by payment of the Dammages and coſts which are recovered: See 14. H. 8. and 9. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.

he had made the Revocation to <hi>Thomas</hi> his eldeſt ſon, &amp; the Heirs Males of his body for 500. years, provided that if he alien, and dye without Iſſue, that then it ſhall remaine to <hi>William</hi> his ſecond ſonne in tayle, with the like proviſo as before, and after dyed; and the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry found, that the Lands whereof no revocation is made, exceeds two parts of all his Lands, <hi>Thomas</hi> the eldeſt ſonne enters the 8.

                     <p>And <hi>Dodridge</hi> the Kings Serjeant argued for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Dodridge.</note> that the ſole queſtion is for the 8. acres purchaſed; and if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of that be good or not by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 34. H. 8. And to that the point is only, a man which hath Lands held in cheife by Knights ſervice, and other Lands held of a common perſon in Socage, conveys by act executed in his life time, more then two parts, and after pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes other Lands, and deviſes thoſe, if the deviſe be good or not. And it ſeems to him that the deviſe is good, and he ſaith, that it hath been adjudged in the ſelfe ſame caſe, and between the ſame parties; And this Judgment hath been affirmed by writ of Error, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to <hi>Thomas,</hi> and the Heirs males of his body for 500. years, was a good eſtate tayle, and for that he would not diſpute it againſt theſe two Judgments. But to the other queſtion hee intended that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe was good, and that the Deviſor was not well able to doe it by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 34. H. 8. And hee intended that the <hi>ſtatute</hi> authoriſeth two things. 1. To execute eſtates in the life time of the party for advancement of his Wife or Children, or payment of his debts, and for that ſee 14. <hi>Eliz. Dyer,</hi> and that may be done alſo by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, before the making of this <hi>ſtatute.</hi> But this <hi>ſtatute</hi> reſtrains to two parts, and for the third part makes the Conveyance voyd as touching the Lord: But the <hi>ſtatute</hi> enables to diſpoſe by Will a parts, where he cannot diſpoſe any part by the Common Law, if it be not by ſpecial Cuſtome, but the uſe only was deviſeable by the common Law, &amp; this was altered into poſſeſſion by the <hi>statute</hi> of 27 H. 8. and then cometh the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of 32. and 34. H. 8. and enables to deviſe the Land which he had at the time of the deviſe, or which he purchaſed afterwards, for a third part of this Land ſhould remain which hee had at the time of the deviſe made; and if a third part of the Land did not remain at the time of the deviſe made, ſufficient ſhould be taken out of that; but if the Deviſor purchaſe other Lands after, hee may thoſe wholly diſpoſe: And for that it was adjudged, <hi>Trin. 26. Eliz.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Ive</hi> and <hi>Stacye,</hi> That a man cannot convey two parts of his Lands by act executed in his life time, and deviſe the third part, or any part ſo held by Knights ſervice; and alſo he relyed upon the words of the <hi>statute,</hi> that is, having Lands held by Knights ſervice, that this
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:41383:188"/>
ſhall be intended at the time of the deviſe, as it was reſolved in <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler</hi> &amp; <hi>Bakers</hi> Caſe; That is, that the <hi>ſtatute</hi> implies two things that is property, and time of property, which ought to be at the time of the deviſe. But here at the time of the deviſe, the Deviſor was not having of Lands held by Knights ſervice, for of thoſe he was only Tenant for life, and the having intended by the <hi>ſtatute</hi> ought to be reall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying, and perfect having, by taking, and not by retaining, though that in <hi>Carrs</hi> Caſe, cited in <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Bakers</hi> Caſe, rent extinct be ſufficient to make Wardſhip, yet this is no ſufficient having to make a deviſe void for any part.</p>
                     <p>Alſo if the <hi>Statute</hi> extend to all Lands, to be after purchaſed, the party ſhall never be in quiet, and for that the <hi>Statute</hi> doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Lands which ſhall be purchaſed afterwards; for the <hi>Statute</hi> is having, which is in the Preſent tence, and not which he ſhall have, which is in the Future tence; and 4. and 5 <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>M. 158. Dyer</hi> 35. A man ſeiſed of Socage Lands, aſſures that to his Wife in joynture, and 8. years after purchaſes Lands held in cheife by Knights ſervice, and deviſes two parts of that, and agreed that the Queen ſhall not have any part of the land conveyed for Joynture, for this was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed before the purchaſe of the other, which agrees with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall caſe, and though to the Queſtion, what had the Deviſor; It was having of Lands held in <hi>Capite,</hi> inſomuch that he had Fee-ſimple expectant upon all the eſtates tayl; he intended that this is no having within the <hi>Statute,</hi> but that the <hi>Statute</hi> intend ſuch having, of which profit ariſeth, and out of which the K. or other Lord may be anſwered, by the receipt of the profits, which cannot be by him which hath fee-ſimple expectant upon an eſtate tayle, of which no Rent is reſerved: and alſo the eſtate tayle by intendment ſhall have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance till the end of the world: and 40. <hi>Edw 3. 37. b. in rationabili parte bonorum,</hi> it was pleaded, that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had reverſion diſcended from his Father, and ſo hath received advancement. And it ſeems that was no plea, in ſo much that the reverſion depends upon an eſtate tayle, and upon which no Rent was reſerved, and ſo no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement. So of a conveyance within this <hi>Statute,</hi> ought ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the youngeſt ſonne, which continues, as it is agreed in <hi>Binghams</hi> Caſe, 2 <hi>Coke,</hi> that if a man convey lands to his youngeſt ſonne, and he convey that over to a ſtranger in the life time of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good conſideration, and after the Father dies, this is now out of the <hi>Statute;</hi> for the advancement ought to be continuing until the death of the Father: And ſo he ſaith alſo it was adjudged in <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Bakers</hi> Caſe; that if a man deviſe Socage Lands, and after ſell to a ſtranger for good conſideration, his Lands held by Knights ſervice, this deviſe is now good for all, for hee hath not any Land held by Knights ſervice at the time of his death, and ſo he concluded that the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:41383:189"/>
deviſe was good, and prayed Judgement for the <hi>Plaintiff. Houghton</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Houghton.</note> Serjeant for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> he thought the contrary, and hee argued that before the ſtatutes of 32. and 34. of H. 8. men were diſabled to deviſe any Land, and for that they cannot provide for their Wives, Children, or for payment of their Debts, and for remedy to that, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offments to uſes were invented, and then to diſpoſe the uſe by their Wills: and then experience finds that to be inconvenient, and then the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of 27. H. 8. transfers the uſe into poſſeſſion, and then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe nor land was deviſeable without ſpeciall Cuſtome, and then this was found to be miſcheivous, after five years experience, and then was the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of 32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. made, and where by the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of <hi>Marlebridg,</hi> of thoſe which did enfeoff their begotten ſons, a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Father to his ſon and Heir was void for all. Now by this <hi>ſtatute</hi> this is good for 2. parts, and void only for the 3d part, &amp; that for the good of the Lord; but as to the party that is good for all, as it is agreed in <hi>Mightes</hi> caſe, 8 <hi>Coke.</hi> Then to conſider in the caſe here, if all things concur that the <hi>ſtatute</hi> requires; and to that here is a perſon which was actually ſeiſed of Land held by Knights ſervice in 12. <hi>Eliz.</hi> So that it is a perſon which then was having within the <hi>ſtatute.</hi> 2. If here be ſuch conveyance for advancement of his children, as is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended within the <hi>ſtatute;</hi> and to that he ſeemed that ſo, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that it may be objected, that here is no execution to the youngeſt children, inſomuch that it is firſt limited to ſuch Farmers and Tenants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he intended that this is no impediment. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, alſo there is a limitation to the uſe of his laſt Will. Thirdly, alſo there is a limitation to the uſe of ſuch perſons to whom he deviſes any eſtate by his Will. But theſe are no impediments, for the laſt is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but a deviſe to himſelfe and his heirs, and there is not any other perſon knowne, but meerely contingent, and it is not like to a remainder limited to the right heirs of <hi>I. S.</hi> for there the remainder is in Abeiance, but here it is only in contingency, and nothing executed in Intereſt, till the contingency happen, and the not having of a ſon at the time ſhall not make difference, as in 38. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 26. in <hi>formedon</hi> in Remainder, where the gift was in one for life, the remainder to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in tayle, remainder in fee to another ſtranger; and he in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder in tayle dyes without Iſſue in the life time of the Tenant for life, he in remainder in fee may have <hi>formedon</hi> in remainder without mentioning the remainder in tayle. But here he intends that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe ſhall be void in reſpect of the Lands firſt conveyed, which were held in cheife by Knight ſervice; for the words of the <hi>ſtatute</hi> are by act executed, either by deviſe, or by any of them, and they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned: and it is not of neceſſity that the time of the Conveyance ſhall be reſpected, but the time of the value. And notwithſtanding that the Teſtator doth not mention any time; But in ſo much as the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:41383:189"/>
proviſion of the <hi>ſtatute</hi> is to ſave primor, ſeiſin, and livery to the King, as if the man had 20 l. by year in Socage, and one acre in cheife, and makes a conveyance of all that, it ſhall be void firſt to the livery, and pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or ſeiſin to the third part: So if he make conveyance of the 20 l. by yeare, and leave the ſaid acre held in cheife to diſcend, and after that purchaſe other Lands to the value of the third part of all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the 20 l. land, notwithſtanding which, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Wife, Children, or payment of his Debts, for he had a full third part at the time of his death, which diſcended. And he ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the having of a dry reverſion depending upon the eſtate tall, is ſufficient, having within the words and letter of the <hi>Statute,</hi> and yet he agreed the eaſe put in <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Bakers</hi> caſe; that if a man deviſe his Socage Lands, and after alien his Lands held in cheife by Knight ſervice to a ſtranger, <hi>bonafide,</hi> this is good. So if he had made a reſervation of his Lands held in chiefe to himſelfe for his life, in ſo much that his eſtate in that ended with his life, and hee remembred the caſe cyted in <hi>Bret</hi> and caſe, Comment. That if a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe a Mannor in which he hath nothing, and after hee purchaſeth it, and dyes, the deviſe is good, if it be by expreſſe name. But when a man hath diſpoſed of two parts of his Land, the <hi>Statute</hi> doth not ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him to deviſe the Reſidue; but he hath done all, and executed all the authority which the <hi>Statute</hi> hath given to him. But he agreed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that the reverſion is not ſuch a thing of value, which might make the third part diſcend to the Heir; but it is uncertaine, as a hundred, and the other things of uncertain value contained in <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Caſe. And alſo he intended, that the remainder could not take effect, inſomuch that the condition is precedent, and it is not found that the eldeſt Sonne hath aliened, and then dead without Heir male, and ſo he concluded, and prayed Judgment for the <hi>Defendant.</hi>

                        <hi>Croſſe</hi> againſt <hi>Weſtwood,</hi> for that the <hi>Defendant</hi> had bought in groſs, and gotten into his hands by buying, and not by Leaſe, 40. quarters of Wheat meale, price of every quarter 40. ſhillings, to the intent to put that in water, and after of that being dryed again, then of that to make ſtarch, againſt the form of the ſaid <hi>Statute,</hi> and ſo demanded fourſcore pounds for the King and himſelfe, according to the <hi>Statute;</hi> and upon this the <hi>Defendant</hi> demurred in Law, upon the Information this caſe came in queſtion: And it was argued by <hi>Nicholls</hi> Serjeant for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> that there was not any Law againſt Ingroſſers known, what was ingroſſing before the making of this <hi>Statute,</hi> which declares and deſcribes who ſhall be an Ingroſſer: Then he conſidered, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſer deſcribed in the <hi>Information,</hi> be ſuch an Ingroſſer which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the <hi>Statute,</hi> and he ſeemed that no, for he ſaid, the Ingroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer contained in the <hi>Information,</hi> is not one which bought Corn grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the field, nor Corn, nor dead Victualls, which are the words contained in the <hi>Statute;</hi> but he is charged for buying of wheat meal, and it ſeems that that is not within the words of the <hi>Statute.</hi> Alſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſer intended within the <hi>Statute,</hi> ought to buy that, to ſell the ſame againe, and ſo is not the Ingroſſer in the <hi>Information</hi> charged, and if he be not within the words, he ſhall not be within the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for it is a penall law, and ſhall not be taken by equity, and ſo much the more, becauſe it inflicts corporall puniſhment upon the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender. And then to conſider the words of the <hi>Statute,</hi> he ſuppoſed that Wheat meale is not within the words, Corn growing, nor Corn; but the queſtion is, if it be within the words, dead Victuals: and to that he ſaid, that it hath been adjudged, that a Coſtermonger which
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:41383:190"/>
buyes Apples to ſell againe, is not within the words (dead Victualls) and he ſaid, that Flower and Meale are things of which Victualls are made, and not Victuals themſelves. But there ought to be another thing done to them by the induſtry of man to make them Victuals; As if a Baker buy Wheat, and make that into Bread, this is out of the proviſion of the Law, and not aided by the Proviſo, which provides for <hi>Fiſh-monger, Poulter,</hi> and <hi>Butcher,</hi> which buyes ſuch things which concern their <hi>Faculty, Crafte,</hi> or <hi>Myſtery,</hi> if it be not by fore-ſtalling, but this doth not extend to all <hi>Crafts.</hi> But hee ſuppoſed that when the nature is altered, that is out of the purviewe, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing, and ſhall not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Alſo he ſeemed that the <hi>Defendant</hi> is not charged that he had an intent to ſell the ſame again: And if a man buy Corne for the proviſion of his houſe, this is out of the <hi>Statute,</hi> notwithſtanding that it be by Ingroſſing. And ſo if a man buy Barley, and make that into <hi>Malt,</hi> and ſell it again in <hi>Malt:</hi> Or if a man buy <hi>Oates,</hi> and convert that into <hi>Oatmeale,</hi> or other Flower, and then ſell it again, this is out of the <hi>ſtatute:</hi> and if ſo it be, then upon this he inferred, that this is not ſo much as if he had ſold that afterwards, when he had altered it in nature, as in making of <hi>Wheat-meale</hi> into <hi>ſtarch;</hi> for in the caſes before cyted, things bought are of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: So if a man hath many Farms or Grounds ſowed with Corn, and he ſells them to another, this is no fore-ſtalling within the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> if it be not driving to <hi>Market:</hi> and he ſaith, that <hi>Regrater</hi> is defyned by the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> to be him which buyes in one <hi>Market,</hi> and ſells that in another <hi>Market</hi> within four miles, and he is an <hi>Ingroſſer,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grater</hi> alſo: So if a man buy <hi>Wheat,</hi> and makes Cakes of that, this is out of the <hi>ſtatute:</hi> Or if a <hi>Merchant</hi> buy Corn beyond Sea, and ſell that here, this is is out of the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> for it ought to be bought and ſold alſo within the Realm; ſo if Corn reſerved for Rent be ſold again, this is out of the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> and ſo concluded; Firſt, that the buying of <hi>Wheat-meale</hi> is not buying of Corn growing, Corn, nor dead Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and the ſale of that in ſtarch, is not the ſale of the ſame thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and prayed Judgment for the <hi>Defendant.</hi>

                        <hi>Dodridge</hi> Serjeant of the King, for the King, and the Informer ſuppoſed the contrary, and to him it ſeemed, that there are three <note place="margin">Dodridge</note> things conſiderable, upon the Statute: That is, the Scope, the Letter, and the offence, and to the offence, he intended that it is the offence which is contained in the Information which is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be puniſhed by the Statute, and he ſaid that the offence is confeſſed by the Demurrer: And he ſaid there were divers good Lawes againſt Ingroſſers before the making of this Statute: But it was not defined who was an Ingroſſer, and this was the Evaſion
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41383:191"/>
that ſuch Malefactors eſcaped without puniſhment. And he ſaid, there are three notable Enemies to the Common Wealth, firſt Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtallers, ſecondly Regraters, thirdly Ingroſſers: And foreſtaller is he which prevents the Sale in open markett, Ingroſſer is he which ingroſſeth in his hands, and Regrater is he which ſells againe, and he which will be an Ingroſſer, will be a Foreſtaller alſo, and ſo of the contrary, and theſe offences make Dearth, and for that their gaine is called a (wicked gaine:) See the <hi>Statute</hi> of 31. <hi>Ed. 1. Rastall Foreſtallers</hi> 1. And they are baſely to be eſteemed, which marchandiſe of Marchants, becauſe they cannot gaine unleſſe at leaſt they lye: And this Statute hath given a livery to thoſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors by which they may be knowne, for he hath them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed and defined, and this is the ſcope of the <hi>Statute;</hi> thirdly he conſidered the Letter, and for the better intelligence of that he conſi ered the Body and <hi>Proviſo</hi> of the Statute, and tie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to an Ingroſſer, and would not meddle with the other offences contained in the Statute, the words of which are, whatſoever per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons ſhall ingroſſe or get into his or their hands by buying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (other then by Leaſe, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and Corne growing in the feilds, or any other Corne or graine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or other dead victualls whatſoever, ſhall be accepted, reputed, and taken an unlawfull ingroſſer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it hath been objected that it is a penall Statute, and for that ſhall not be taken by equity, and alſo is declaratory, and for reaſon alſo ſhall be taken ſtrictly: But he ſuppoſed, that admitting that the offender contained in the information be out of the Letter of the <hi>Statute,</hi> that yet he ſhall be within the equity, and that the <hi>Statute</hi> ſhall be taken by equity, but he intended firſt, what was within the Letter of the Statute, for Wheat made into meale is Wheat, and Barley made into Malt is Barley, and ſo it is contained in the information, that is, that he hath bought Wheat made into Meal, and allowing that Corn is victuall, then <hi>a fortiori,</hi> meal is dead victuall, for it is a degree neerer to the uſe of man and to ſuſtenance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>; and by the ſame reaſon that it is not victuall, inſomuch that another thing ought to be made to it, before it may be uſed, by the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon fleſh ſhall be no victuall, for that ought to be boyled or roſted, which is another thing alſo before it can be uſed: and he ſaid that meal is the ſtaffe of ſuſtenance, and of all dearths, the dearth of Meale and Corne is the moſt greateſt, and he which wants bread, wants all other victualls, for all others without this breedes diſeaſes, and for that Corne is the victuall of victualls, and ſo he ſuppoſed this remaines Corne, and admitting that not yet it is within the words (dead victualls) Alſo he intendes that the Statute ſhall be taken by equity, notwithſtanding it be penall, inſomuch that it is for publicke good, as the Statute of 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. of petty treaſon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines

the Maſter only: And yet if a Servant kills his Miſtris, that ſhall betaken within the <hi>Statute:</hi> And ſo if the Servant kills his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter after that he is departed out of his ſervice, upon malice concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved during the time that he was in his ſervice, this ſhall be alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Statute,</hi> and yet is not within the words of the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> and ſo of the <hi>ſtatutes</hi> of 13. and 27. <hi>Eliz.</hi> of fraud upon taking by equity, and yet all theſe <hi>ſtatutes</hi> are penall: But inſomuch that they are made for the publicke good, and for puniſhment of offences which tend to the contrary, they ſhall be out of the generall rule; But he intended that the ſame thing which was bought was ſold againe, for it is confeſſed by the information, that he hath ſold Meale, and it was not the thing that was firſt bought, and if it were ſuſtenance before that the water was put to it, the putting of water to it doth not make alteration, and is contained in the information, that the Defendant ſold the ſame meale that he had bought by the name of Starch, and this is confeſſed by the Demurrer, and by that if meale be victuall, then he hath ſold meale victuall by the name of Starch, and to the objection, that it is not the ſame thing, inſomuch that the Replevin doth not lie, for the meale after that is made in Starch, he ſaith Replevin doth not lie for the Corne it ſelfe if it be not in bags, and if the meale were in bags, notwithſtanding that water were put to it, yet Replevin lies, and it is reaſon that this ſhall have a large and beneficiall conſtruction, inſomuch as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peres by the preamble, that this is made againſt the Catterpillers of the Common Wealth: And to the objection that the Statute is Declaratory, and for that it ſhall not be taken by equity, if this rule ſhall be obſerved, then all the queſtions in the Court of Wards, and in <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Bakers Caſe 3. Coke</hi> they have been in vaine. And yet it appeares that equity was there taken for equity. But in theſe caſes the expoſition may be beſides, but not contrary to the words, and alſo he intended that the <hi>Proviſo</hi> expounds the Body of the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> and by the <hi>Proviſo</hi> it appeares, that the buying of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley and converting it into Malt, and the Sale of that afterwards, and the buying of Oates and the converting of that into Oate-Meale, and the ſale of that afterwards ſhould be within the <hi>Statute,</hi> if it had not been excepted by the <hi>Proviſo;</hi> and yet there is an alteration of the thing which is bought: And if a man buy Barley by foreſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and make that in Malt, and then ſell that againe, this is within the <hi>Statute,</hi> and there is no difference betwixt this Caſe and Malt, for the Barley is put into water and dryed againe, and ſo it is here, the Meale is put in water and dryed againe, and yet that is within the <hi>Statute:</hi> And the manner and nature of offence, every one which hath a Houſhold and Family knowes, for the fineſt Wheate Meale makes ſuſtenance for the Maſter of the Family, and the other
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41383:192"/>
makes ſeverall ſorts for the reſidue of the Family, and the Brann makes Bread for Horſes; ſo that the vertue of that is, that it feeds both Man and Beaſt, and all this is prevented by making that new deviſed vanity, and the quantity of Wheat which is imployed is incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and may feed many, and if the makers of that have gained the name of an occupation, this is worſe, for this furthers vanity, and takes away the ſuſtenance of many, and inhanceth the price of Wheate, and is ſo new aninvention that there is not a Latine word for it, and ſo he concluded that he is an Offender, and within the ſcope of the letter of the Law, and that the <hi>Preamble and Proviſo</hi> hath been ſo expounded, and that as to meane occupations, as Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and ſuch like which bought Hydes and ſold them again, and he ſaid that they did them further for the uſe of man, and made that more apt and fit for uſe, and without that a man could not uſe them, but in this Caſe the Starch-makers further the abuſe, and prayed Judgment for the King, and for the Informer.</p>
                     <p>And at another day this caſe was argued again by <hi>Haughton</hi> for <note place="margin">Hanghton.</note> the <hi>Defendant,</hi> that the <hi>statute</hi> is penall for forfeyture of Goods, as for coporall puniſhment, and for that it ſhall not be taken by Equity, nor by interpretation, but ſtrictly according to the Letter, as in <hi>Reniger and Fogaſſas caſe, Commentaries 18.

dead Victuall, for it is not Victuall till another thing is made of it, alſo the ſame thing that was bought ought to be ſold again, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ſhall not be within the Words of the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence out of the penalty, as if a man buy Corn, and make that into Meale, Bread, or Puddings, this is not within the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> ſo the buying of Apples and ſelling of them again, it is no victualls within the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> ſo Butcher which buyes Cattell, and thoſe kill and ſells again is not within the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> and he ſayes that Starch is good Food when it is dry again, which proves that this is another thing then the Meale which was bought, and ſo out of the Letter of the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> and to the <hi>Proviſo</hi> which excepts Barley that is bought and made in Malt, and Oates, made in Oate-Meale and ſold again, it ſeems that this is an idle <hi>Proviſo</hi> and ſurpluſage, as in <hi>Porters</hi> Caſe, 1 <hi>Coke</hi> 24. 6. in the <hi>ſtatute of</hi> 27 H. 8. <hi>Proviſo</hi> to except good uſes out of the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> inables men to deviſe to ſuch uſes, and ſo the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of 5 <hi>Ed. 6. chapter</hi> 16. the Body of which extends only to Offices, Covenant, Adminiſtration of Juſtice, or the Revenue of the King, as Receiver, Controller, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet a Keeper of a Park is excepted out of this, more for the ſatisfaction of the ignorant Burgeſſes then for any neceſſity, and ſo he concluded and prayed judgment for the <hi>Defendant.</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, It is the ſame ſubſtance, and the ſame forme, that is the formall ſubſtance which gives the being, but not an accedentall forme, and he ſaith, that if a man have Corne, and another by wrong takes it from him, and doth convert it into Meale, he may take that back again; otherwiſe of Iron made into an Anvill, but trees made into Timber, and plate altered in faſhion, may be taken back again, otherwiſe if it be converted into Coyne, and ſo upon the <hi>Statute</hi> of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8.

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41383:193"/>
to the Objection that this is a thing invented after the making of the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> he anſwered that, with the caſe of <hi>Saint-John, 5 Coke 71. b.</hi> Which inhibits Hand-Guns, and it is there adjudged that Dags and Stone-Bowes, which are of later Invention ſhall be within the <hi>ſtatute</hi> for they are their invention, and their form of the things which are inhibited, and ſo <hi>Vernons</hi> caſe, 4 <hi>Coke,</hi> if he to whoſe uſe infeoffs his Son and Heir, this ſhall be taken within the <hi>ſtatute of Marlebridge,</hi> and yet he to whoſe uſe cannot make a Feoffment, nor uſes were not known till many yeares after the making of this <hi>statute,</hi> and <hi>Baker</hi> furthers the Meale for the uſe of man, and for that he may ſell it in Bread without any puniſhment, and then he ſayd it was the Office of a good Judge to ſuppreſſe the miſcheife, and to advance the remedy as the Lord <hi>Anderſon</hi> ſayth in <hi>Brownes Caſe, 3.

Where it is agreed that if a man takes Barley and makes Malt of that, that he from whom it was taken, could not take the Malt, for that, that there the thing is altered in another nature, and he intended that the Starch is not the ſame in number nor quality, but he agreed, that if wheat be only grownd, that this notwithſtanding is within the Statute, but if it be made into Bread, then ſold, it is not within the Statute, for then it is another Body, and other things added to it, and the forme is alſo altered, and the forme gives the being and the name, and if Water be turned into Wine, it is no Water, though it be by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; ſo if a Parſon be made Biſhop, he is not the ſame perſon, for Honours change Manners, and this is his reaſon that the Writ ſhall abate, for it is newly created, as of nothing, 7 H. 6. 15. 22 <hi>R. 2.

Alſo he intended that it is the ſame both in number and form, and he agreed (that forme gave the being) for that is not the accidentall as here it is, but it is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall forme, and every one knows that Meale of Wheat, is the ſame as Pepper beaten in a Morter, and Pepper and all other Spices, ſo that it is the ſame in number, exiſtence, ſubſtance, and eſſence, and he intended alſo the ſame in intention, for Meale is Victuall, and is dead Victuall, be it Corne or Meale; and Corn grownd, and made in Meale, then ſold, yet that remains dead Victuall, and Meale is the ſame dead Victuall, though that it be not the ſame Corne; and to prove that Corn is Victuall, he cyted the <hi>Statute</hi> of 25 <hi>Edw. 3. 5.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:41383:197"/>
by that, that the Plaintiff was afore times barred, if it be in a reall Action, it ought to be averred, that it is for the ſame Land, and if it be in a perſonall Action it ought to be averred that it is the ſame Debt or Treſpaſſe, and if it be pleaded by way of Juſtification, then he ought to have averred alſo, that the Plaintiff hath taken a falſe and untrue Oath, upon which Iſſue might have been taken: But here nothing is pleaded but the Record, and nothing averred <hi>(in Facto)</hi> So that the Iſſue cannot be taken upon it, for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is only of Record, and that the Defendant for the cauſe afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid in the Record afore ſaid mentioned, ſpoke the ſaid words, and this is not good, for there is not contained any cauſe of Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in <hi>Quare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Impedit,</hi> in the 15. and 16 <hi>H.</hi> 6.

And alſo that they have not incroached only upon matters, as to hold plea for Free-holds, but alſo to perſons and place where Contracts and Treſpaſſes were made, and this was the cauſe of the making of the ſaid <hi>Statute.</hi> And to this action of Treſpaſſe for <hi>indebitatus aſſumpſit</hi> there begun, he intended that it is for another thing, of which they could not hold plea, and it might be criminall; for Civill is that which begun by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, and it is part of the commutative Juſtice, for which is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence given by one party to another, and is not founded upon the <hi>Contract,</hi> but is tranſlated to an action of Treſpaſs, which manner of Treſpaſs is not within the <hi>Statute:</hi> and ſo he intended, that for the

As where an Obligation is with a Condition, to pay money at ſuch a day, the payment of another thing is good, if the Obligation be to pay a certaine Sum of money: But if a man be bound in a Sum of money, to make another Collaterall thing, the acceptance of an other thing Collaterall ſhall not be a Barr, for money is to the meaſure, and the price of every thing, if a man be bound in two Horſes to pay one, acceptance of another thing ſhall be no Barr: But the acceptance of

                        <hi>HAughton</hi> Serjeant for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> argued that the entry of him in Remainder is not lawfull, inſomuch that he intended it is <note place="margin">Haughton.</note> not any forfeiture of the Eſtate tayle, and firſt he argued that the condition is not good, but repugnant to Law, and for that voyd, and yet he agreed that Tenant in tayl may be diſtrayned from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king unlawfull Acts, but here the condition tends to reſtraine him from doing of things which are lawfull as if a man makes a Gift in tayl, upon condition that the Wife of the Donee ſhall not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, or that the Husband of the Donee ſhall not be Tenant by the Curteſie, or that a Feoffee ſhall not take the profits of the Land, though that the profits may be ſevered from the Land, as in 16 <hi>Ed. 3. Formedon</hi> was brought of the profits of a Mill, yet the condition is voyd, inſomuch that it is againſt the nature of an Eſtate tayl, or in Fee-ſimple to be in ſuch manner abridged, ſo if a man makes a gift in tayl upon condition, that the Donee ſhall not make waſte, the condition is void, for the making of waſt is a priviledge which is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to an Eſtate tayle, and for that the condition reſtraynes the Tenant in tayle of a thing which the Law inables him to do, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is yoyd, ſo a Donee in tayle upon condition, that he ſhal not make a Deed of Feoffment or Leaſe for his own life, as it is agreed in <hi>Mildmayes</hi> Caſe, ſo here when the condition reſtraynes Tenant in tayl of concluding and agreeing, the which in him is not any wrong no more then if a man ſhould make a gift in tayl upon condition that the Donee ſhould not bargaine and ſell the Land, this is voyd, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he doth not make any wrong or diſcontinuance: So in the caſe here, for the thing which is reſtrayned, that is (conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:41383:205"/>
&amp; agreeing) is in it ſelf a lawfull act, and alſo this is only the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and qualities of the minde, that they cannot make an Eſtate conditionall, if an open act be not annexed unto it, but he agreed that if a man make a gift in tayle, or a Leaſe for life of white acres, upon condition that the Donee or Leſſee ſhall not take the profits of Black acre, this is a good condition, for this doth no wrong, nor is repugnant to the Eſtate given, or leaſed. And ſecondly, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, that admitting it is a good condition, yet here is no act done to operate (concluſion or agreement) which might make a forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for he ſayd that <hi>Mildmayes</hi> caſe was an expreſſe condition, that Tenant in tayl ſhould not ſuffer common recovery, the which he might lawfully do at the common Law, and he was not reſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Statute of <hi>Donis conditionalibus,</hi> which was doubted till 12 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. but here he intends that the (agreement and concluſion) in this caſe ſhall make no forfeiture, in reſpect that the Wife in whom the Eſtate, was marryed at the time of the making, and then when her Husband joynes with her, it ſhall be ſayd the agreement of the Husband, and not the agreement of the Wife, and yet he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed the caſe in, 20 <hi>H. 8. b. Dyer</hi> 1. that if a man makes a Leaſe for yeares upon condition, that the Leſſee his Executor or Aſſignes ſhall not alien, and there if the Wife executrix, and her ſecond husband alien, that this shall be forfeiture, inſomuch that there the condition followes the Eſtate, and is inherent to it, but here the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement is collaterall and perſonall, and this depends upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, as if condition be that a woman shall not beate <hi>J. S.</hi> and she takes a Husband which beats him, this ſhall not be forfeiture, for the condition is annexed to the perſon of the wife, and for that the beating of the Husband ſhall be no breach of the condition, but the waſt of the Husband is the Waſt of the Wife alſo, for that followes the Eſtate and is not perſonall, ſo he agreed that acts made by a Wife married, the which ſhe is compellable to do are good, as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition between Coparceners, as it is ſayd by <hi>Littleton,</hi> or Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Goods by Executor or Adminiſtrator, or to make attorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo of things made for her benefit, as accepting an Obligation, or the bringing of an action of Waſt upon a Leaſe made by him are alſo good, but here the agreement and concluſion made by her and her Husband, are for the diſadvantage of the Wife, and for that they are meerly voyd, as to the Wife, as in 3 H. 6. 19. 50. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is made with the Husband and Wife and they joyne in debt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, and the writ abated, inſomuch that the contract to the Wife is void, and ſhall be intended to be made with the Husband only, and ſo in <hi>Ruſſells</hi> caſe 5 <hi>Coke 27. b.</hi> It is agreed that a marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wife cannot do any thing as Executrix to the prejudice of her Husband, ſo in 45 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 11. Leaſe was made by Husband and wife,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:41383:206"/>
and they covenanted to make ſuerties, and after the Husband dies, and the Wife accepts the Rent, and she shall not be bound by her Covenant, inſomuch that this was Colaterall to the Eſtate, and if it be ſo that the agreement made by the married Wife is void to her, then it is no agreement and by conſequence no forfeyture of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: Alſo he intended that the concluſion of the condition, for the words of the condition depends only upon the agreement and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, and not upon any Act made: So that the ſuffering of any Act, doth not make any matter in the caſe, nor is to the purpoſe, and alſo the Replication relies only upon the agreement, ſo that the Recovery is not materiall: And he intended that it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and that it cannot be Limitation, inſomuch that the words are, that the Eſtate ſhall ceaſe, as if ſuch perſon had not been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Will, and ſo that the Eſtate shall ceaſe, as if he had been dead, which are words of Defeazance only and not of Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for he doth not appoint the Eſtate to continue ſo long: And alſo the words are repugnant, for it cannot make the Eſtate void as if he had not been named, for this is only the office of an Act of Parliament to make a man to be dead to one, and to be alive to another purpoſe; and ſo he concluded, and praied Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Defendant: <hi>Nicholls</hi> Serjeant for the Plaintiff argued, <note place="margin">Nicholls.</note> that it is a matter ſufficient upon which Judgement ſhall be given for the Plaintiff, and he firſt conſidered the words of the Condition; that is, if the deviſees by themſelves or by any other, ſhall make any concluſion or agreement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This shall be a forfeyture; as in 28, H. 8. 13. <hi>Dyer</hi> 65. Where a Leaſe was made to the Husband and Wife, <hi>Proviſo</hi> that if they are diſpoſed to ſell and alien the Tearme, that the Leſſor shall have the firſt offer, and agreed, that if that be a Condition, and the Wife ſurvive the Husband, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that it was not her Deed, but the Act of the Husband, she shall be bound by that, inſomuch that her Eſtate is bound with that, and this was the pleaſure of the Leſſor, and she cannot hold it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then it was given, and 47. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 12. If a man makes a Leaſe for yeares to the Husband and Wife, and after outs them, they shall joyne in a Covenant, and ſo 48. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 18. They joyne in a Fine, yet there the Husband only brings Debt for the money, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that it be the Land of the Wife which was ſold, and 38. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 9. If the Husband and the Wife joyne in Covenant: See 45. <hi>Ed, 3. 11. b.</hi> Where they joyne in Leaſe, and alſo to make further aſſurance, and the Husband and the Wife alſo charged with that, and ſo in the 20. H. 6. 25. Feoffment was made to a woman ſole upon condition, and after she takes a Husband, which breakes the Condition, ſo in 35. <hi>aſſiſ.</hi> 11. A woman ſole makes a Feoffment upon condition to re-enfeoff upon requeſt, and after takes
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:41383:206"/>
a Husband, and then makes requeſt and good, and if it be ſo in theſe caſes, then in this caſe the Wife shall not be received, to ſay the agreement was made againſt her will, and for this, ſee the <hi>Statute</hi> which gives <hi>Cui in vita</hi> to the Woman, where the words are, to whom she in her life could not contradict.</p>
                     <p>And after this agreement, if the Husband give warrant of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney to ſuffer Recovery this is ſufficient, as it is agreed in 4. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and in 6. <hi>Coke 41. Mildmayes</hi> Caſe is agreed: That if a man make a Feoffment to a Husband and a Wife upon condition that they ſhall not alien, it is good to reſtraine alienation, by which it apeares that if they Joyne in Feoffment, that this ſhall be forfeyture, and yet this is the Feoffment of the Husband only, So here the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, notwithſtanding it is the Act of the Husband, yet inſomuch that it is againſt the expreſse words of the Condition, this ſhall be breach of the Condition, and he intended that the words of the Condition amount to as much, as if he had ſaid, that neither the Daughter ſole, nor the Daughter with another Daughter, or with another perſon ſhall make agreement, and the other perſon of neceſſity ſhall be intended her Husband, and ſo this agreement by the Husband and the Wife is within the words of the Condition: And alſo he ſaith that it is argued in <hi>Becwiths</hi> Caſe 2. <hi>Coke</hi> that a married Wife may declare a uſe of a Fine which is levied of her Inheritance, and if the Husband declare uſes, the Wife may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolle them: And if an Eſtate be conveyed with power, that the Husband with the aſsent of his Wife may revoke that, the aſsent of the Wife to ſuch revocation is good: So if <hi>Proviſo</hi> be, that a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Wife only without her Husband may make revocation of uſes and declare new this is good, and revocation made by the Wife, and declaration of new uſes are very good, and he agreed that in matters of Record, the Husband cannot prejudice the Wife with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her conſent, as Warrant of Attorney upon a <hi>Quid Juris Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat,</hi> or <hi>Per que ſervitia,</hi> or other Act which concernes her Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, as in 9. <hi>H. 6. 52. 46. Ed. 3. 11. 43. Ed. 3. 5. and 27. H.</hi> 8. If a married Wife joyne with her Husband in a Feoffment of her owne Land, rendring Rent, and after the Husband dies and the Wife accepts the Rent, this ſhall bind her, which proves that it was her Feoffment as well as the Feoffment of the Husband. Secondly he conſidered the words of the Condition, which are: (Conclude and agree) <hi>&amp;c,</hi> the which he intended not to be ſo uncertaine, as going about, but they are Iſſuable and triable, as it is agreed in 5. <hi>Ed. 4. 6. Com. 56. a. Wyrbiſh</hi> and <hi>Taylbois</hi> Caſe, conſent to a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhment within the <hi>Statute of 6. R.</hi> 2. is Iſſuable and triable, ſo of conſent and agreement within this Condition, for though that the words are conſent and agree, yet it ought to be otherwiſe an
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:41383:207"/>
Act ſubſequent, that is, reconvey, ſuffer, or other ſuch Act or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall not be forfeyture, for to make Elopment which ſhall be a forfeyture of Dower, there ought firſt to be conſent, but that is not ſufficient, but there ought to be alſo departure from the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and then the Law adjudges upon all the Act: So here when it is an agreement, and another Act ſubſequent, which is executed, then the Law ſhall judgeupon altogether: and for that this agreement conſiſts of two parts, firſt when the Wife upon the motion of the Husband concludes and agrees to do the Act, which is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the agreement, and then when the Husband and the Wife upon that joyne in Deed indent, as in this caſe, this is a conſummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and makes a breaking of the condition, and this is not like the condition in <hi>Myldmaies</hi> Caſe, where every going about ought to breake that, as if he goe to Councell to be adviſed upon his Eſtate: Thirdly he inten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ed that the condition is not repugnant to the Eſtate, in reſpect that an other thing is to be done before the forfeyture, and after the concluding and agreeing, for the Wife remaines in <hi>Seiſin</hi> after the agreement, till the Recovery or other Act be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted: And alſo he argued that before the <hi>Statute</hi> of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. of Fynes: Tenant in tayl might be reſtrained of alienation of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, for untill that he could not Barr the Iſſue in tayl. So at this day he intended that a gift in tayl upon condition that he ſhall levie a Fine without proclamations this is good, and out of the power which is given to Tenant in tayl to Barr the Eſtate tayl by the levying of a Fine: And levying of a Fine without proclamations is only a diſcontinuance, and ſo tortious, ſo when a Condition doth not extend to all acts, but only to all unlawful acts, and for that it doth not extend to a Recovery, for that is a lawfull Act, as it is agreed in <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticas</hi> Caſe 10. <hi>H. 7. 10 11. H. 7. 6, 7. 21. H.</hi> 7. and 28 <hi>H. 8.

H. 7. of fines, If aman hath agift in tayl with condition that he shal not alien: And after the <hi>Statute of</hi> 4. H. 7. is made which inables him to barr the Eſtate tayl by fine, yet he intended that the condition should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine him from all unlawfull Alienations: And he intended as well as ſuch a condition annexed to a Leaſe for life is good, ſo is it being annexed to an Eſtate tayl; for as well as it is in one caſe for the preſervation of the reverſion: So is this in the other caſe, and as in 6. <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 227. Grant of Rent, <hi>Proviſo</hi> that it shall not charge the perſon of the Grantor, shall not extend to the Executors of the Grantor, but shall be determined by the death of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: And ſo as a condition that a married Wife or an Infant ſhall

not alien is good, inſomuch that this is wrong, ſo he intended that if this were a good condition at the Common Law, that Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tayl shall not alien the Eſtate by 4. H. 7. and 37.

And to the ſecond, that is, that the <hi>Defendants</hi> have nothing but for yeares, and that the free-hold is to a ſtranger, he intended that this is not good, &amp; yet he agreed that in <hi>ſcire facias</hi> where a free-hold is to be recovered, ſpeciall non-tenure is a good plea, as in 8 <hi>Edw</hi> 4. 19. and 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 32. but not of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and there alſo generall non-tenure is no plea: But here where the <hi>free-hold</hi> is not to be recovered, nor one nor the other is a Plea; for it may be averred that the <hi>Defendant</hi> hath a releaſe from him that hath the reverſion: and as in 14 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 5. in <hi>ſcire facias</hi> to accompt againſt an <hi>Executor</hi> who pleads that the <hi>Teſtator</hi> was never his <hi>Bayliffe</hi> to give an accompt, and yet it is agreed that this hath been a good plea for the firſt <hi>Defendant,</hi> and this is the reaſon that it was not taken, nor was allowed for a good plea in the 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 11.

                        <hi>Dodridge</hi> the Kings Serjeant, to the exception which hath been <note place="margin">Dodridge.</note> made by the other party, that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> ought to averr that he hath Beaſts which ought to Common there, and that his Beaſts have loſt their Common, that need not to be averred, but it ſhall be pleaded by the other party; for if he have diſtrayned the Beaſts of a ſtranger, doing damage, he need to averr no more in this action, and to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter, and the two Objections which have been made by the other part: Firſt, that the Commoner hath no right to the Common, till he have taken it by the mouth of his Beaſts; to that he ſaid, that the Commoner hath right to that before that it be taken by ſuch mouths of his Beaſts: and notwithſtanding that it ſeems by the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. That Commoner cannot grant his Common till he have Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin of that, yet 12 H. 8. is otherwiſe, and that a Commoner may have an action the name implyes, for he hath Common with others, and a ſtranger which is no Commoner cannot do wrong, but this is damage to him; and he cyted <hi>Bracton,</hi> 430. that there are two forms of <hi>Writs,</hi> 1. Curſitory <hi>Writs,</hi> 2. Commanding <hi>Writs:</hi> The firſt of thoſe which are formed, and are of courſe, and the others ſuch of which there is no form, but are to be formed by the Maſters of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> according to every particular Caſe: So that there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Caſe,</hi> but that the Law affords a <hi>Writ</hi> and remedy for that, as in 28 <hi>Edw. 4. 23. Action upon the Caſe was framed againſt an Officer, which gave priviledge to one as his ſervant, which was not his ſervant: and it is not like to the Caſe in</hi> 11 H. 4. 47. a. <hi>where a School-maſter
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:41383:210"/>
brings an action upon the Caſe againſt another for erecting of a School in the ſame Towne to his damage, but this was damage without Injury.</hi> But here the Commoner hath received wrong and damage; but yet he agreed that the Commoner could not have action of Treſpaſs why he broke his Cloſe, for that is proper for the owner of the Soile. But it hath been agreed to him, that he might diſtrain them, doing da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; and the reaſon of that is, inſomuch that he hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved damage, and amends may be tendered unto him in recompence of his damages, without any regard to other Commoners, as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in 24 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 42. And to the Objection, that if one <hi>Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> may have action, then every <hi>Commoner</hi> may have the action, and ſo the ſtranger ſhall be infinitely puniſhed. And to that he ſaid it is a Publique loſſe and private; and when the publique wrong includes private damage to any man, there he to whom the private damage is done may have action: And he ſaid, that the Regiſter contains many <hi>Writs</hi> for publique wrong, when that is done to private men, as <hi>fol.</hi> 95. A man fixes a pale, croſſe a navigable River, by which a Ship was caſt away, and the Owner maintained action of Treſpaſſe: And <hi>fol.</hi> 97. A man brought Treſpaſſe againſt one which caſt dung into a River, by which his Medow was drowned; ſo if the River be infected with watering Hemp or Flax, he which hath fiſhing there may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain action of Treſpaſſe: and 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 11. Action of Treſpaſſe by one for ploughing of Land where one had a common way; and ſo it is 13. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 17. One brings an action of Treſpaſſe againſt another for ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a Lyme Kill where many others are annoyed by that: So by an aſſault made upon a ſervant, the Maſter and ſervant alſo may have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall actions; and ſo in the other caſes many may have actions, and yet this is no reaſon to conclude any one of them, that hee ſhall not have his action, for in truth thoſe are rather actions upon the Caſe, then actions of Treſpaſs, for the truth of the Caſe is contained in the Writ. Alſo in this caſe it doth not appeare that there are any other <hi>Commoners</hi> which have Common there, and for that this Objection is not to the purpoſe: and it appears by <hi>Heiſman</hi> and <hi>Crackeſoods</hi> Caſe, 4 <hi>Coke</hi> 31.

                     <p>THE Caſe was: A Copy-hold Eſtate was granted to one <note place="margin">Copy-hold.</note> for life, remainder to another for his life, the firſt Copy-holder for life, accepts a Bargaine and Sale of the free-hold from the Lord, and after that levies a Fine with proclamations, and five yeares paſſe, and then he dies,, and if this Fine ſhall be a Barr to him, which hath the Copy-hold Eſtate for life in remainder was the queſtion: And it was argued by <hi>Harris</hi> Serjeant, that the Eſtate of Fines in the body of that binds all perſons, but onely ſome which have Infirmities, and by the ſaving Rights, Titles, Claimes, and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts are ſaved: But Title comes in the conditionall percloſe of ſaving, that is, ſo that they purſue their Title, Claime, and Intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By way of Act or lawfull Entry within five yeares next after the ſaid proclamations had and made: So that in this caſe the principall matter to be conſidered is, what thing is operated by the acceptance of the Bargaine and Sale, for if by that the remainder of the Copy-holder be turned to right, then inſues that the Fine shall be a Barr: And it ſeemes that this determines the firſt Eſtate for life, and he agreed that it cannot be a ſurrender, inſomuch that there is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſene remainder, as it is 37. <hi>H. 6. 17. b. 4.

and extinct by acceptance of a new Leaſe, as it is there, and in 22. <hi>H. 7. 51. a.</hi> agreed and ſo it was adjudged in <hi>Hillary 30.

                        <hi>Dodridge</hi> the Kings Serjeant agreed, that the ſole queſtion is if any thing be here done to turn the Copy-hold-Eſtate in remainder into a right, for then he agreed that this ſhall be barred, otherwiſe not, and to that hee intended, that the firſt Eſtate for life ſhall be ſayd to be in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> notwithſtanding the acceptance of the Bargaine and Sale, as to all eſtrangers, and eſpecially when it is to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, as if Tenant grant Rent, and after ſurrenders his eſtate, now between the parties, the Leaſe ſhall be extinct by the ſurrender, but to the Grantee of the Rent it ſhall be ſayd to be in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> and if during his life, he in Remainder alſo grants a Rent, hee ſhall hold the Land ſubject to both the Rents, though that the grants be both to one ſelf ſameperſon, ſo if he in Reverſion grants his Reverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with warranty, and after the Tenant for life ſurrenders, and the Grantee be impleaded, he ſhall never vouch during the life of the Tenant for life, 5 H. 5. <hi>Comment. 24 Ed.</hi> 3.

                     <p>The firſt, to barr thoſe which have preſent right, and they ought to make their claim within five yeares after the Fine levied, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhall be barred.</p>
                     <p>And the ſecond thoſe which have Right, title, or intereſt accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after the Fine levied, by reaſon of any matter which preceded the Fine, and in both caſes the Eſtate which is barred ought to be
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:41383:214"/>
turned into a right, or otherwiſe it ſhall not be barred, the which cannot be here, for the eſtate is given by the Cuſtome, and it is to have his beginning after the Death of the firſt Tenant, and though that the firſt Tenant commit Forfeiture, yet he in remainder cannot enter, for his time is not yet come, as in 45 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. is a collaterall Leaſe with warranty to the Tenant for life in poſſeſſion, this ſhall not be a barr, inſomuch that it is made to him which hath poſſeſſion, ſo if a man make a Feoffment upon condition, and the Feoffee levy a Fine with proclamations and five yeares paſſe, and the condition is broken, the Feoffee may enter at any time, otherwiſe if the Fine had been levied after the condition broken, and ſo if the Lord be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

for years or life, accepts a Fine upon conuſance of right, this is a forfeiture, inſomuch that it is a matter of record, and it ſhall be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoppel to ſay that he did not take Fee by that, &amp; doth not admit the Reverſion to be in another, alſo inſomuch that the Bargain and ſale was executed by the Statute for this cauſe it ſhall not be prejudice, as it was adjudged in the Lady <hi>Greſhams</hi> caſe in the Exchequer, 28 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Where two ſeverall conveyances were made with power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation upon tender of ten pound, and adjudged by act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that a revocation was good, and alſo that no licenſe of aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be made, inſomuch that it was by act of Parliament, which doth no wrong, and it is for the Treſpaſſe, for which the <note place="margin">Revocation of Uſes.</note> party ought to have licenſe, and if it be not Treſpaſſe there need no licenſe before hand nor pardon afterwards: So if a man makes a Leaſe for yeares, remainder for yeares, the firſt Leſſee accepts Bargaine and Sale, this ſhall not turn theſe in remainder to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly it ſeemes to him alſo, that notwithſtanding the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Bargain and Sale, the firſt Copy-hold Eſtate for life re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> and is not determined. For this differs from an Eſtate of Land, for it ſhall not be ſubject to a Rent granted by the Lord: the firſt Eſtate remaines, till all the remainders are determined, for the firſt tenant for life cannot ſurrender to the Lord, alſo it is cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eſtate, for by the Common Law this being granted to three ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, this ſhall be determined and extinct for the third part, for they three take into poſſeſſion, and the word ſucceſſively, ſhal be taken as void, but here the Cuſtome appoints, that the remainder ſhall not have his beginning, till the death of the firſt-Tenant, and that they ſhould take by ſucceſſion, and for that there is a difference between this cuſtomary Eſtate, and other Eſtates at the Common Law, and other ſurrenders, for if a Copy-holder ſurrender to the uſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for life, nothing paſſeth but for life only, the Lord hath not any remainder by this Surrender, and if this Tenant for life commits forfeiture, he in reverſion ſhall not take advantage of that, and if at the Common Law Tenant for life, remainder for life or in fee be, and the firſt Tenant for life makes a Feoffment, and after levies a Fine, and reſolved that he in reverſion ſhould not be bound till 5 years are incurred after the death of the 1. Tenant for life, for then his title of Entry firſt accrues in apparancy, and before that is in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, of which he in remainder is not held to take notice, and ſo in this caſe he in remainder ſhall not be bound till five yeares are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred after the death of the firſt Tenant, and the rather inſomuch as the firſt Eſtate remaines, for that that the firſt Tenant was only paſſive and not active, and ſo he concluded that Judgement ſhall be given for the Plaintiff, inſomuch that the Fine was no Bar, and

upon this concordance of all the three Juſtices in opinion, no other Juſtices being preſent this <hi>Tearm</hi> Judgment was entered accordingly.</p>

Secondly, That the Covenant ſhall extend to the Leaſe made to <hi>Thim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blethorp;</hi> for it doth not appeare, but that it is the ſame <hi>Deane</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> which was in time of <hi>H.</hi> 8.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:41383:217"/>
for 3 lives: So that this hath a good beginning, and continued till it was avoyded by the Entry of the ſucceeding <hi>Dean,</hi> for this remains good againſt the <hi>Deane</hi> that made it: But <hi>Thimblethorp</hi> alſo may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it during his Tearm, and now here is eviction by the Aſſignee of <hi>Thimblethorpe,</hi> before that the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Covenant</hi> that the wind ſhall not peirce nor break the Trees: and 2 <hi>Ed. 4. 12 Ed.</hi> 4. Action of <hi>Covenant</hi> lies upon expreſs <hi>Covenant,</hi> though that a ſtranger enters without ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and he cyted one <hi>Dormans</hi> caſe to be adjudged, that where a man borrows money upon a uſurious contract, and the principall gives ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to the Surety that was bound with him by collaterall Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and the Surety being arreſted, takes advantage of the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond, notwithſtanding that the principall Obligation was void by the <hi>Statute</hi> of Uſury. So here, notwithſtanding that the eſtate was void, and that is the principall: Yet the <hi>Covenant</hi> being expreſſed, and collaterall, ſhall bind the Leſſor, and ſo he concluded that Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be given for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Warburton</hi> Juſtice to the contrary, and yet he agreed that the live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">Warburton.</note> was good, notwithſtanding that it was made by the Attorney, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three Rent dayes incurred, and he ſeemed that it might be made at any time during the tearm and the lives of the parties. And alſo he agreed that the Corporation shall be intended the ſame Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet Corporation had no <hi>Predeceſſor</hi> nor <hi>Succeſſor:</hi> but the <hi>Statutes</hi> ſay, <hi>Predeceſſors, Anteceſſors,</hi> and <hi>Progenitors</hi> of the King, as 39 <hi>H. 6. 7 Ed. 4. 2 H.</hi> 6. But he did not inſiſt upon that, but agreed that: But the matter upon which he inſiſted, was, that the Leaſe to the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> was void againſt the ſucceeding <hi>Deane</hi> and <hi>Chapter,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the leaſe to <hi>Thimblethorp</hi> was in <hi>Eſſe</hi> at the time of the making of that, and this by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> And it appears that the <hi>Deane</hi> which made the Leaſe to the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> is dead, for he is named in the Count, the late <hi>Deane;</hi> and then when the <hi>Covenants</hi> depend upon the eſtate, be they expreſsed, or in Law, theſe determin and end with the eſtate, as in <hi>Lemons</hi> caſe, 28 <hi>H. 8. Dyer</hi> 28. 189. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that where the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. makes Leaſes being in the hands of Spirituall perſons void, this avoids theſe <hi>Covenants</hi> alſo which depend upon the Leaſe. So if a Parſon make a Leaſe and <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> that he will not be non-reſident, and binds himſelfe for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that, if the Covenants be releaſed, the Obligation alſo is
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:41383:217"/>
releaſed. So if the Leaſe be avoyded, the Covenants alſo are avoyded: And as an action of Covenant doth not lye for the not injoying of Land after a ſurrender, ſo Covenant doth not lye after the eſtate is avoyded, ſee 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. And to the caſe put by <hi>Wynch</hi> of counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond, where the Principall was void by the <hi>staiute</hi> of Uſury: he ſaid that there the Obligation was not void, but voidable by plea. But here it is, the eſtate is made void by the expreſs words of the <hi>ſtatute:</hi> and he intended that this difference between expreſſe <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> in Law, but that the one determines with the eſtate as well as the other, and yet he agreed that expreſs <hi>Covenant</hi> ſhall extend to charge the <hi>Covenanter</hi> upon Entry by a ſtranger, which hath no title; but yet this doth not charge the <hi>Leſſor</hi> after the eſtate deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and ſo he concluded that Judgment ought to be given for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>

He ſuppoſed that the expreſs <hi>Covenant</hi> ſhall bind the <hi>Leſſor,</hi> though it be referred to the tearm; for tearm includes Eſtate and Intereſt, but this is when it is Tearm; but when it is no Eſtate, then it ſhall be intended during the continuance of the years, as it appears by the Rector of <hi>Chedingtons</hi> Caſe: and this he held clear, and ſo of promiſe alſo, as if a man makes a Leaſe for years, and before that the <hi>Leſſee</hi> enters, makes a leaſe to another, and promiſes that the ſecond <hi>Leſſee</hi> ſhall enjoy during the tearm, if the firſt <hi>Leſſee</hi> enter, the ſecond <hi>Leſſee</hi> may have an action upon the promiſe, and he ſaid that it was adjudged in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> Hill. 35 <hi>Eliz.</hi> between <hi>Foſter</hi> and <hi>Wilſon,</hi> Plaintiffs, and <hi>Mayes,</hi> Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; where the caſe was, A man made a Leaſe of a Rectory for years, and covenanted with the <hi>Leſſee</hi> to ſave him harmleſſe againſt one <hi>Blunt</hi> Parſon of <hi>Dole,</hi> which entered and outed the <hi>Leſſee,</hi> which brought Covenant againſt the <hi>Leſſor,</hi> and reſolved that it lyes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that it doth not appear whether he had Intereſt or no: So that be the Leaſe good or void: yet when there is an Eviction, <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>

lyes, though the Leaſe be originally void, yet till it be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it ſhall be intended a good Leaſe: And if a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> doe not bind them, none will take Leaſe of them, ſo they ſhall be compellable to plow the Land themſelves, and alſo he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the Leaſe was good againſt the ſucceeding <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> till it be avoyded by Entry, as it was adjudged, <hi>Trin. 30 Eliz.</hi> between <hi>Elmer</hi> and <hi>Page,</hi> where a Biſhop made a Leaſe for years, and dyes, the <hi>Succeſſor</hi> makes a Leaſe for 3 lives, the Leaſe for years not determined: And it was reſolved that the <hi>Leaſe</hi> for 3 lives was void, notwithſtanding that the Biſhop might make a concurrant <hi>Leaſe</hi> for years, which is not made void by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the <hi>Statute</hi> is in the definitive, that is, <hi>Leaſes</hi> for 3 lives, or 21 years, and ſo they cannot make both, for then the <hi>Leſſee</hi> for life ſhould have the Rent reſerved upon the <hi>Leaſe</hi> for years, which is ſetled in the <hi>Leſſee</hi> for 3 lives, by the regreſs of the <hi>Leſſee</hi> for years: and ſo he ſaid alſo, notwithſtanding that the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> made void all Leaſes made by <hi>Deane</hi> and <hi>Chapters,</hi> where there are more then 3 years in being; he agreed that a <hi>Leaſe</hi> for years, where there are ſo many years in being is good: but if there be but two years in being, that makes the <hi>Leaſe</hi> for life void. And he agreed that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> yet any <hi>Leaſe</hi> ſhall be good againſt the <hi>Deane</hi> himſelfe, inſomuch that he is party to that, and hath a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive voyce in the making of that: And he ſeemed that the Proviſo in the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of 18 <hi>Eliz,</hi> did not extend to <hi>Leaſes</hi> in poſſeſſion, but to <hi>Leaſes</hi> in reverſion, which are dormant, of which a ſtranger cannot take notice, inſomuch that they are inviſible; and for that, if a <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Chapter</hi> procure ſurrenders of them, and within 3 years, that ſhall make another <hi>Leaſe</hi> good, and ſo they ſhall ſave their <hi>Covenant;</hi> and for that the <hi>Leaſe</hi> here made to the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had been good, if the <hi>Defendants</hi> had procured the <hi>Leaſe</hi> made to <hi>Thimblethorp</hi> to be ſurrendred within 3 years after the taking of that. Alſo he cyted the Caſe betwixt the Biſhop of <hi>Lychfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> and <hi>Sale</hi> to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, <hi>Michaelmaſs</hi> 32. and 33. <hi>Eliz.</hi> That a grant of the next a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydance is good againſt a Biſhop himſelf that granted it, and not made void by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> as to him, but to all <hi>Succeſſors</hi> only. And ſo in this caſe he ſaid, they all agreed that the <hi>Leaſe</hi> was not void which is made to <hi>Waters</hi> againſt the <hi>Deane</hi> himſelf which made it, but only againſt the <hi>Succeſſor.</hi> And he ſaid alſo, <hi>Covenant</hi> in Law extends to lawfull <hi>Evictions,</hi> and to <hi>eſtates</hi> in being, and not where an eſtate is determined, as if <hi>Leſſee</hi> for life makes a <hi>Leaſe</hi> for years, and dyes, the <hi>Leſſee</hi> ſhall not have an action of <hi>Covenant</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Covenant</hi> in Law, as it is agreed in 9 <hi>Eliz. Dyer,</hi> and 38 <hi>H.</hi> 6. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cyted. So alſo he ſuppoſed to expreſs reall <hi>Covenants</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to <hi>Free-hold,</hi> or <hi>Inheritance,</hi> as Warrant and Defend, upon
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:41383:218"/>
which a man cannot have an action, if he be not outed by one which hath title; and as in 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 7. and 21. A man makes a <hi>Feoffment</hi> with warranty, <hi>nonfeoffavit,</hi> is a good Plea; for if the <hi>Feoffment</hi> be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, the <hi>Warranty</hi> alſo is avoided, for that depends upon the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offment.</hi> But if a man makes a <hi>Leaſe</hi> for years, and <hi>covenants</hi> that he will warrant and defend the Land to the <hi>Leſſee,</hi> if the <hi>Leſſee</hi> be outed by one which hath title, or without title, he may have an action of <hi>Covenant,</hi> for the <hi>Leſſor</hi> hath the Evidences, and ought to defend the poſſeſſion of his <hi>Leſſee,</hi> and the right alſo, and damages are only to be recovered; and ſo is the difference between a <hi>Leaſe</hi> and <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,</hi> though that the words of the <hi>Covenant</hi> are all one. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he ſaid that it may be objected, that the Incorporation (was not well pleaded) by <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. Inſomuch that he doth not ſay after the Conqueſt, for <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. was <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. in truth, ſor there were 3 <hi>Edwards</hi> before the Conqueſt, and he was the third after: And he ſaith that he hath known many exceptions to be taken to that, but hath not known any of them to be allowed, and for that he will not inſiſt upon it. But the principal matter upon which he inſiſts, was, that it doth not appear by the pleading, that the <hi>Deane</hi> which made the <hi>Leaſe</hi> was dead: and it appears by the pleading, that he entered in 4 <hi>Jacobi</hi> and was ſeiſed, and then of neceſſity ought to be living; and ſuch aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his life is ſufficient, as it is agreed in the 13 <hi>Eliz. Dyer,</hi> where a Parſon made a <hi>Leaſe</hi> for years, and the <hi>Leſſee</hi> brought an <hi>Ejectione firme,</hi> and in pleading it was ſaid; that the Parſon is ſeiſed of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and this was allowed to be good without other averment of his life, for he cannot be ſeiſed if he be not living: and then if the <hi>Deane</hi> ſhall be intended to be living, then they all agreed that the <hi>Leaſe</hi> ſhall be good againſt him; for it was adjudged in this Court between <hi>Blackeleech</hi> and <hi>Smal,</hi> that if a Biſhop makes a <hi>Leaſe</hi> for years, and after makes a <hi>Leaſe</hi> for life, the <hi>Leaſe</hi> for years being in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> and dyes, and the Succeſſor accepts Rent, this ſhall bind him: and by this it appears that the <hi>Leaſe</hi> was good againſt the <hi>Dean</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf which made it, and alſo againſt the Succeſſor, till he enter and avoid it, and then by conſequence the action of <hi>Covenant</hi> ſhall be very well maintainable, and ſo he concluded alſo that Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be given for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>

as it was adjudged in <hi>Barramores</hi> and <hi>Yardleys</hi> caſe by the Education of the Iſſue, or a <hi>Deviſe</hi> upon condition to pay money, and the <hi>Executor</hi> pays it, this is a good execution: But here the thing which makes the execution is only releaſe, which enures as Releaſe. And for that the accepting of the releaſe, it cannot be <hi>execution</hi> of a Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But if the <hi>Executor,</hi> to whom the firſt <hi>Deviſe</hi> was made, had had any <hi>Co-executor,</hi> and he would not have ſuffered him to joyn in occupation with him, that had been full Declaration of his Intent, that he took it as a <hi>Deviſe,</hi> and not as an <hi>Executor,</hi> as it is agreed in the 10 <hi>El. 277. Dyer</hi> 50. And he ſaid alſo, that it hath been agreed to him, that it is ſuch a poſſibility that cannot be granted, as it is agreed in <hi>Fulwoods</hi> caſe, 4 <hi>Coke, 66. b.</hi> And he ſaid it is not like to <hi>Harveys</hi> &amp; <hi>Bartons</hi> caſe, where two Joynt-tenants for life were, and one made a Leaſe for years to begin after his death, and dyed, and his companion ſurvived him, and agreed to be a good Leaſe againſt the Survivor, notwithſtanding the Contingency. And he conceived that this might be releaſed, and that it is not like to contingent actions, inſomuch that it is a releaſe of right in Lands, ſee 5 <hi>H. 7. 31. b. Colts Aſſiſe,</hi> where it is ſaid, if Lord, Meſne, and Tenant are, and the Meſne is forejudged by the Tenant, and after the Lord releaſes to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and after by <hi>Parliament</hi> it is enacted that the fore-judger ſhall be void, yet the releaſe ſhall be good againſt the Lord, and ſo of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by <hi>Executor</hi> before Probate: and 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Barr, Releaſe of Dower by Fyne doth extinguſh it: and <hi>Althams</hi> caſe 8 <hi>Coke,</hi> if it be made to the Tenant of the Land, that ſhall be a Barr. And 21 <hi>H. 7. fol.</hi> the laſt, <hi>Releaſe</hi> to a Patron in time of Vacation ſhall be a Barr in annuity brought againſt the Incumbent: and if the <hi>Leſſee</hi> for years be outed, and the <hi>Diſſeiſor</hi> makes a Leaſe for years to a ſtranger, and the firſt <hi>Leſſee</hi> releaſe to them both, this is good, as it is 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. and yet regularly ſuch releaſe is not good without privity: But inſomuch that it is of right to the Land, and to one which hath poſſeſſion, it is very good. So Releaſe by Copy-holder, extincts his Copy-hold right, as it is reſolved 4 <hi>Coke,</hi> amongſt the Copy-hold caſes, and yet hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that ſome poſſibilities cannot be releaſed, as in <hi>Albayns</hi> caſe, power of Revocation, if it be not to the Tenant of the Land, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that this is a meer poſſibility. So if an annuity depend upon a condition precedent; but where the returning of the eſtate is to the party himſelfe, as in <hi>Diggs</hi> caſe, 1 <hi>Coke</hi> 174. <hi>a.</hi> And alſo the releaſe in this caſe is the more ſtrong, inſomuch that the eſtate in this is reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as in the caſe of 44 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. in releaſe of Ayde. And ſo he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that admitting there be no election and execution of the Legacy by the acceptance of the Releaſe, then the title of the <hi>Defendant</hi> is good, and if it be a good election &amp; execution: Yet he conceived that all the tearm remains in the firſt <hi>Deviſee,</hi> and that the remainder is

deſtroyed by the releaſe, and ſo prayed Judgment for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> and ſo it was adjourued.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, As to the Objection, that the living of the other Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen which are not imployed in the Barge is by that abridged, and that when the Water-man is willing to carry, and the Paſſenger to be carried by him, it is no reaſon that a By-Law ſhould abridge this voluntary act of a man, upon which his lively-hood depends, he ſayd that ſo it is not, for nothing is challenged by the By-Law, but only preheminence, and that proviſion be made for the Poore, which is for the publick good, for every one may go with any that he will paying two pence to the Barge or after the Barge is furniſhed paying nothing, and he conceived that the Liberty of the ſubject ought to be ſo abridged, but not alltogether aboliſhed, as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Yorkes</hi> Caſe in the Regiſter in the Writ of Treſpaſſe <hi>fol. 105. b. c. 8 Coke 125. a.

Which gives penalty for not <hi>ſetting forth of Tythes,</hi> but doth not appoint who shall have them: and this was adjudged to be to him which ought to have <hi>the Tythes,</hi> but <hi>this cannot be ſo here,</hi> inſomuch <hi>that it</hi> is againſt the Grant, and <hi>agreed that</hi> a ſtranger shall be bound by By-Law, <hi>where it</hi> is for the publick good, but not otherwiſe, and alſo the cuſtome that theſe Bardge-men shall have the preheminence, may be good, as well as cuſtome <hi>that the poore</hi> of ſuch a Parish shall have common in ſuch a place till ſuch a day, and then the others, and ſo in this caſe; and ſo he concluded <hi>that</hi> Judgement shall be Arreſted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Warburton</hi> Juſtice conceived that the Count is good, and that <note place="margin">Warburton.</note> the Inhabitants may preſcribe very well, as 47. <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> foure Townes were charged for the repaire of a High way, and ſo may the two Townes for the Ferrey, that he intended to be high way upon the water, and alſo he conceived that this is inquirable in Eyre, and alſo by the Juſtices of the Kings Bench, and now by the Juſtices of Aſſiſes by Indictment by the name of Inhabitants: The which may be as good an Action upon the <hi>Statute of Winton</hi> againſt the Inhabitants of the Hundred, and ſo he conceived, that in this caſe the Inhabitants of <hi>Milton and Graveſed</hi> may be puniſhed by Indictment if they do not repaire the Ferrey, and that the King <hi>there</hi> this day may <hi>erect</hi> a Ferrey in place <hi>where</hi> it is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> for the King may <hi>erect</hi> office which is for the <hi>benefit</hi> of the Common Wealth, but not to charge the Common Wealth.

                        <hi>Coke cheife</hi> Juſtice ſeemed the contrary, for he conceived it is not ſhewed in the Count to whom the <hi>Ferrey</hi> belongs, for the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of that are not mentioned, the which it ought: And yet he <hi>agreed</hi> that a <hi>Ferrey</hi> may be without owner, as it is <hi>agreed 12.

Secondly it is alledged that <hi>Infra Eaſterne</hi> Townes, <hi>there</hi> is ſuch a cuſtome that the Inhabitants may make conſtitutions, and that the Inhabitants ſhall maintaine a <hi>Ferrey,</hi> but not that <hi>there</hi> was a <hi>Ferrey,</hi> but that he conceived it might be good, inſomuch that it is not traverſable.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly what Action the Inhabitants may have, if they be diſturbed of it, for this is no eaſement, and they have no Eſtate of Inheritance, and for that the Preſcription by the name of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants is not good, for they cannot have Eſtate, and to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 6. H.</hi> 6. chapter 7. Which ſaith, it is a laudable cuſtome and uſage that a Bardge ſhall be maintained, but not that Inhabitants ſhall maintaine that, nor thoſe incorporate, ſo that the <hi>Statute</hi> doth not make them capable of ſuch a thing, for which a Writ of right, and aſſiſe by the <hi>Statute of Weſtminſter</hi> 2. lies.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, That the cuſtome and the Patent are repugnant, for by the cuſtome the Bardge hath not any <hi>preheminence nor precedence,</hi> but equall liberty was to all water-men to carry what <hi>paſſengers</hi> that they could, and with that alſo <hi>agreed the Statute of 6.

And then if the cuſtome <hi>were</hi> not ſo, this cannot be made by the grant of <hi>the Queene,</hi> nor by the By-Law, for this is the liberty of the Subject, the which cannot be abridged nor reſtrained by them, for if the King may grant ſuch <hi>preh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Toll.</hi> 2. Where the King grants Toll for every one which paſſeth by a Common way: And <hi>agreed that</hi> it was not good if it be in a Common Way, or in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon River, for as it is reſolved in the 22. <hi>aſſiſ.</hi> 93. Every common River is as high <hi>Street,</hi> and Common Waies and the paſſengers Way as the water increaſes, and the Thames is a branch of the Sea and a common <hi>Street,</hi> as it appears by <hi>Bracton fol.</hi> 8. 5. The Plaintiffs have brought their Action by the name of Corporation of <hi>Port-reeve,</hi> Jurats, and Inhabitants of <hi>Milton and Graveſend,</hi> and they
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:41383:227"/>
are incorporate by the name of <hi>Port-reeve,</hi> Jurates, and Inhabitants of <hi>Graveſend,</hi> poſſeſſors of Ships, the which words are left out in the name, by which the Action is brought, ſo that the By-Law is not made by the ſame name, by which they are incorporate, nor the Action brought by the ſame name: And yet <hi>he agreed</hi> that they might make a By-Law according to the grant, without calling all the Inhabitants to it.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, He conceived that the conſtitution is not purſued, for the conſtitution is; that if any Water-man carries any paſſenger willing to go by the Bardge, that ſuch Water-man ſhall pay for every ſuch paſſenger two pence. And it is not averred that the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers which the Defendant hath carried, were willing to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by the Bardge, and ſo not purſued.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, The Conſtitution is further that no Wherry-man ſhall carry any paſſenger, before the Bardge be fully diſmiſt and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, and this is not good, for it may be the Bardge will not paſſe to <hi>London</hi> at all this Tyde, and for that it ought to be averred that the Bardge departs in convenient time after <hi>that it</hi> is furniſhed, for otherwiſe cuſtome that none ſhall put his Beaſts into ſuch a place, till the Lord hath put in his Beaſts is not good, for it is reſolved in 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. 24. And the reaſon is, inſomuch that it may be, <hi>that</hi> the Lord will not put in his Beaſts at all: And to the objection <hi>that</hi> the By-Law ſhall not bind a ſtranger, he conceives that if all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances had <hi>been</hi> concurrent; <hi>that had been</hi> very well, inſomuch that it was within the place <hi>where</hi> they had power to make By-Lawes, and alſo for the publick good, and this as well as the cuſtome of Forraine bought, and Forraine ſold, the which is only for ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: And to the objection, that they are ſeverall owners of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Bardges, and for that ought not to joyne in this Action, he ſaith this doth not appeare by the Count, but it is ſaid that they <hi>were</hi> poſſeſſed, and for that they ſhall be intended Joynt Owners; and ſo he concluded, that Judgement ſhall be arreſted.</p>

                     <p>IN action of Treſpaſſe for <hi>Aſſault</hi> and <hi>Battery,</hi> the caſe was this: The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in his Count ſuppoſeth the Treſpaſſe to be made the firſt day of <hi>May, 8 Jacobi,</hi> at ſuch a place. The <hi>Defendant</hi> pleads that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> the ſame day would have aſſaulted and beaten him, and that the <hi>Defendant</hi> laid his hands upon him to defend himſelfe, and if any hurt came unto him, it was by his own wrong, the which is the ſame Treſpaſſe for which the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> hath complained him.
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:41383:227"/>
The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> replyes, of his own wrong without ſuch cauſe, upon which Iſſue was joyned; and at the <hi>Niſi prius</hi> for Juſtification, the <hi>Defendant</hi> produced Witneſſes, which proved an aſſault to be made by the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> upon the <hi>Defendant</hi> long time, that is, by the ſpace of a yeare before the day contained in the Count, and that at this time the <hi>Defendant</hi> to defend himſelfe, hath aſſaulted the <hi>Plaintiff:</hi> And upon this Evidence the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> demurred, inſomuch that this proves an aſſault made at another day then is contained in the Count, and the <hi>Defendant</hi> by pleading hath confeſſed an <hi>Aſſault</hi> and <hi>Battery</hi> made upon the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> the day contained in the Count, and now upon Evidence proves his Juſtification at another day: and if this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence were ſufficient to prove his Juſtification, was the queſtion. And if by this pleading the day be made materiall, in which it was agreed by the Court, and Councell alſo, That if the <hi>Defendant</hi> had pleaded not guilty, the day had not been materiall. But the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe</hi> might have given in Evidence any <hi>Battery</hi> before the day contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the <hi>Count,</hi> or after before the action brought, and this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to prove his <hi>Declaration:</hi> but the Parties, that is, the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> by his <hi>Count</hi> and <hi>Replication,</hi> and the <hi>Defendant</hi> by his <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> have agreed of the day: And for that if they may now vary from that it was moved, and ſo it was adjourned.</p>

                        <hi>Davis</hi> Serjeant argued for the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> that the <hi>Defendant</hi> ought <note place="margin">Davis.</note> to have confeſſed and avoyded, or traverſe the point of the action, and not conclude Judgement if action: See 1 <hi>Eliz.

is, when he meddles without any colour of title or authority, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Debts, and diſpoſing the goods to his owne uſe.

                        <hi>Barker</hi> Serjeant for the <hi>Defendant,</hi> argued, that though that the <note place="margin">Barker.</note> action in which <hi>Harnego</hi> recovered, was begun after the action now hanging, yet inſomuch that judgment was firſt had in that: now that ſhall be preferred otherwiſe before Judgment, for till Judgement the elder action ſhall be preferred.

And he conceived that the plea is good, that the <hi>Defendants</hi> have not goods, beſides the goods, which do not amount, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And divers preſidents were cyted by him to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as <hi>Trin.</hi> 18.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Coke</hi> cheife Juſtice ſeemed, that in an action brought againſt one as Executor, he may plead that Adminiſtration was committed to him for ſuch intent that the dead dyed Inteſtate, and demands Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if action without traverſe, that he was Executor, and with this
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:41383:228"/>
agreed, 1 <hi>Ed. 4. 2. a. 20 H.</hi> 6. 23. And ſo if the Ordinary be charged as Executor, he may plead that he adminiſtred as Ordinary without traverſe, that he was Executor, but only shewed that the party dyed <hi>Inteſtate,</hi> and the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> ought to reply, that he made a Will, and the <hi>Defendant</hi> proved that, and traverſe that he dyed <hi>Intestate,</hi> and with this agreed 9 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. 33. and 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. 11. And if an action be brought againſt <hi>Executor</hi> of his own wrong, hee may plead that <hi>adminiſtration</hi> is granted to ſuch an one, and the Party dyed <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,</hi> and demand Judgment if action, for he ſhall not be charged for more goods then came to his hands: But if a man adminiſter of his own wrong, and after rightfull <hi>adminiſtration</hi> is committed to him, yet he may be charged as <hi>Executor</hi> of his own wrong, inſomuch that Right of action is attached in him. But this ſeems for the goods that he hath adminiſtred before rightfull <hi>adminiſtration</hi> committed unto him. And he cyted 14 <hi>Eliz. Dyer 305. b.</hi> where in debt brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt one as <hi>Executor,</hi> which pleads never <hi>Executor,</hi> nor ever ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred as <hi>Executor;</hi> and the <hi>Plaintiffe</hi> replies, that he adminiſtred as <hi>Executor</hi> of the Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo to Iſſue. And in Evidence the <hi>Defendant</hi> ſhews <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>adminiſtration</hi> to him committed of goods of the dead, by which he adminiſtred them, and before that he did not adminiſter, and this ſeems there to be good Evidence, but the Book was <hi>Quere</hi> of that, and for that he would rather plead that in abatement of the Writ, and ſo the Book inclined alſo. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived here, that the medling with the goods here by the <hi>Defendant,</hi> as <hi>Adminiſtrator,</hi> made him <hi>Executor</hi> of his own wrong, inſomuch that it was for Funeralls, and when it is a work of <hi>Charity,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to preſerve them. And the <hi>Defendant</hi> hath not conveyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be <hi>Executor,</hi> inſomuch that he ſaid, that <hi>adminiſtration</hi> was committed to him by an Arch-Deacon, and he doth not ſay that <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of right belonged to him to commit, inſomuch that hee hath but a ſub-ordinate Juriſdiction: And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law doth not take notice, that he, nor no other but the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hath ſuch power, and for that the power of all which have ſuch ſubordinate and peculiar Juriſdiction is pleaded, that ought to be ſhewed, as it ſeems by 1 <hi>Ed. 4. 2. a. b. 22 H.</hi> 6. 23. And the rather when this is pleaded by the Adminiſtrator himſelfe, which ought to have notice of that, and make title to himſelfe; and if ſo it be, then he conceived that the Recovery by <hi>Hornego</hi> was void, and ſo all the goods confeſt, remain as <hi>Aſſets.</hi> Alſo he conceived, that if the <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor</hi> allow a <hi>Writ</hi> to ſuffer Judgment to be had againſt him, upon a <hi>Writ</hi> which is abateable, he ſhall not have allowance of that, but this ſhall be returned as <hi>Devaſtavit,</hi> as in 10 <hi>Edw. 3. 503. a.</hi> If the Tenant vouch when he might have abated the <hi>Writ,</hi> he ſhall loſe the benefit of his <hi>Warranty:</hi> So here and Com. <hi>Manwells</hi> caſe, 12. <hi>a.</hi> 22

Mannor, but onely one <hi>Memorandum,</hi> that it was made in the houſe of the Lord, but it is not found that this Houſe was parcell of the Mannor, but after it is found that the Leſſee by force of this was <note place="margin">Verdict uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</note> ſeiſed, by which it is implyed that it was very well executed, and this being in ſpeciall verdict, would be very good, he conceived, there were two principall matters in the Caſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Upon the Bargaine and Sale of Trees, if they be re-united to the Mannor, or remaine undivided.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Upon the two cuſtomes, the which he conceived depend upon a queſtion, for the firſt warrants the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>And to the firſt, When a man deviſes a Mannor for three lives, and by the ſame Deed in another clauſe, bargaines and ſells the Trees, and then inſues the <hi>Habendum,</hi> and this is of the Mannor only, and limits Eſtate of that for three lives without mention of the Trees, hee conceived that the Trees paſſe before the <hi>Habendum</hi> abſolutely, and it is not like to a Bargaine and Sale of a Mannor with Trees, or Advowſon appendant, and here the purpoſe and intent appeares, that they ſhall paſs together and as appendant: But in the firſt caſe they ſhall paſſe as a Chattell immediately upon the delivery of the Deed before any livery made upon this to paſs the Mannor, and if Livery had never been made, yet he ſhall have the Trees, ſee 23 <hi>Eliz. 379. 18 Dyer,</hi> Where a man deviſes and grants a mannor and trees, <hi>Habendum</hi> the Mannor for one and twenty yeares without mention of the Trees, and yet by <hi>Windham, Periam, and Meade, against Dyer,</hi> the Leſsee cannot cut and ſell the Trees, for there was all in one ſentence, that is, the grant of the Trees and the Demiſe of the Mannor, ſee the 8 <hi>Coke Pexells</hi> Caſe, how a Grant ſhall be conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and where that ſhall be intended to paſs Inheritance, and where to paſs but a Chattell, where a man grants a Chattell and ten pound yearly to be payd, and in 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. If a man hath Inheritance and a Leaſe in one Town, and he by one and the ſame Deed, gives, Grants, Bargaines and ſells all to one, <hi>Habendum,</hi> the Inheritance to him and his Heires, this is no forfeiture of the Leaſe, inſomuch that the <hi>Fee doth not paſſe of that,</hi> ſo in the Principall Caſe, <hi>Fee-ſimple</hi> paſſeth in <hi>the Trees,</hi> and <hi>Free-hold in the Mannor,</hi> and he conceived that by the Demiſe over, the Land and <hi>Trees</hi> are not re-united, and this he collected out of <hi>Herlackendens</hi> Caſe 4. <hi>Coke and 12. Eliz. Bendlowes,</hi> a man made a Leaſe for anothers life, and bargaine and ſold the <hi>Trees</hi> to him for whoſe life <hi>Leſſee</hi> dyes, he for whoſe life becometh occupant of the Land, he ſhall have ſeverall Eſtates, one Eſtate in the Land, and another Eſtate in the Trees, and ſo in <hi>Ives Caſe, 5 Coke 11. a. Leſſee</hi> takes a Leaſe firſt of Land ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the woods, and after takes a Leaſe of the Woods and Trees, and they remaine diſtinct and though that after there are generall
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:41383:233"/>
words in the Leaſe, that is, of all Meadowes, Paſtures, Profits, Commodities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That is not materiall, for theſe ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to all ſuch things which belong to the Land, and ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded this point, that the <hi>Trees</hi> remain ſeverall from the Land, and do not paſſe to <hi>Hoskins</hi> by the Demiſe of the Copy-hold only, and ſo he cannot take advantage of the forfeiture, otherwiſe he did not doubt but that the particular Sum might take advantage of the forfeiture.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for the cuſtomes, he conceived that the firſt, that is, that the Copy-holder for life might nominate his Succeſſor, and is good, and ſo for the ſecond, that ſuch Copy-holder may cut and ſell all the Trees growing upon his Copy-hold, and he conceived that the validity of the cuſtome, ought to be adjudged by the Judges, and the Truth of that by the Jury, and when it is found true by a Jury, and that it hath ſuch antiquity that <hi>exceeds</hi> the memory of man, then this obtaines ſuch priviledge as the Prerogative of a Prince, and is part of Law, and ſtands with it, and this is reaſonable cuſtome, and ſo it hath been adjudged in the Kings Bench, the reaſon is, inſomuch that the cuſtome is the life of the Copy-hold, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which that depends, and the party is but a <hi>Conduit</hi> to nominate the Tenant, and when he is nominated and admitted then he takes by the Lord, and that ſtands with the rules and reaſons of the Common Law, that is, that a man deviſes that a marryed wife ſhall ſell his Land, and ſhe may ſell notwithſtanding the Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for ſhe upon the matter nominates the party, and he takes by the Deviſe, and by this reaſon, <hi>ſhe may ſell to her Husband as it is agreed by the 8 of Aſſiſes.</hi> And alſo by deviſe that Executor ſhall ſell, Executor of Executor may ſell, notwithſtanding that he is not in <hi>Eſſe</hi> at the time of the Deviſe, and ſo a Leaſe for life to one, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder to him that <hi>J. S.</hi> ſhall nominate is good after nomination, and then he takes by the firſt Livery, as it is <hi>agreed in 10 H.</hi> 7. and <hi>J. S.</hi> Only hath the nomination, and nothing paſſes to him, and with this alſo agrees 43 <hi>Ed. 3. 19 H.</hi> 7. So if a man makes a Feoffment to the uſe of himſelf for life, with diverſe Remainders over, and power to himſelf to make Leaſes for three lives, this is good, as it is <hi>agreed in Mildmayes</hi> Caſe and <hi>Whitlocks Caſe, 8 Coke,</hi> and yet the Eſtate doth not paſſe from him but out of all the Eſtates, and he upon the matter hath only the nomination of <hi>the Leſſee,</hi> and of the lives, for all the eſtates apply their forces to make that good, and the 2 <hi>El. Dyer</hi> 192. 23. Cuſtome that the Wife of the Copy-holder for life ſhall have her Widdows Eſtate, is allowed to be a good cuſtome, and there an Eſtate for life upon the matter is raiſed out of the eſtate for life, and annexed to it, and this is by the Cuſtome, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he conceived to be for that that Women ſhould be incouraged
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:41383:233"/>
to marry with their Tenants, and by that the marriage with the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the cuſtome in this Caſe doth bind the Lord, and ſo 4 <hi>Coke,</hi> there are divers cuſtomes by which the Lord is bound, and <hi>the 8 Coke Swaines Caſe,</hi> where the Copy-holder by cuſtome hath the Trees, <hi>in Caſe where the Lord himſelf hath them not,</hi> ſo if the Lord ſell the Waſte, yet the Copy-holder ſhall not looſe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in that, notwithſtanding that the Eſtate of the Copy-holder be granted after the Waſt is ſevered from the Mannor, and <hi>it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in Waggoners Caſe 8 Coke,</hi> that cuſtome is more available then the Common Law: <hi>And for that this cnſe hath been adjudged in this point between Crab and Varney</hi> by three or four Judges, he would not further queſtion it. And for the ſecond cuſtome, <hi>he agreed that one bare Tenant for life,</hi> could not meddle with the Sale or falling of the Trees, but here is a Copy-holder for life which hath Aut ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty given by the Lord, and the Cuſtome to diſpoſe the Trees; and he ſaith <hi>that Bracton and the</hi> old Laws of <hi>England</hi> calls Copy-holders <hi>Falkland,</hi> and ſaith they cannot be moved, but in the hands of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Falkland,</hi> What is ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</note> the Lord they ought to ſurrender, <hi>and agreed that this is within the Rules of the Common Law, for Conſuetudo privat communem legem</hi> and the Law doth nor give reaſon of that, for this is as a ground, and need not to be proved, for the reaſon of every cuſtome cannot be ſhewed, as it was ſayd in <hi>Knightly and Spencers Caſe,</hi> and he ſayd, that Mannors are divided into three ſorts of Tenures.</p>
                     <p>The firſt holds by Knights Service, and this is for the defence of the Lord, and they have a great number of Acres of Land, and pay leſs Services.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond holds by Socage, and this for to plow and manure the Demeſnes of the Lord, and they ſhall pay no Rent nor do other ſervices, and this was at the firſt to draw ſuch Tenants to inhabit there, and for that they have Authority to diſpoſe and ſell the Trees growing upon theit Tenements.</p>
                     <p>The third, <hi>holds by baſe Tenure, and theſe were at the Will of the Lord, and theſe were to do Services,</hi> and then theſe in many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes have liberty for their Wives in ſome caſes to diſpoſe that for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life, and to diſpoſe the Trees, <hi>and ſo it is in Ireland</hi> at this day, where ſome give more and greater priviledge then others, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Tenants to inhabite and manure their Land, for there every day is a complaint made to the Councell for inticing the Tenants of the Lord, and 14 <hi>Ed. 3.

profit of the Land of another, for a great part of the yeare, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the giver of the Soyl, &amp; 6 <hi>Ja. It was adjudged in the Kings Bench between Henrick and Pargiter,</hi> that the Lord may be ſtinſted for Common in his own Laud, and in the Book of <hi>Entries 563. It appears that by Cuſtome</hi> Copy-hold granted, <hi>Sibi &amp; ſuis, was a good Fee-ſimple,</hi> and the reaſon of all this is ſhewed in the 4. <hi>Coke,</hi> amongſt his Copy-hold Caſes, <hi>where it is agreed that the Life of a Copy-hold Eſtate is the cuſtomes,</hi> and then if the Cuſtome gives life to the Eſtate, this gives life alſo to all the Priviledges which are incident to the Eſtate, and the Lord is but the means to convey the Eſtate from one to another, and as in 38 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. A man hath a Houſe as Heir to his Mother, and after a ſtranger grants <hi>Eſtovers</hi> to him and his Heirs to be burnt in the ſame Houſe, theſe Eſtovers ſhall go to the Heirs of the Mother, inſomuch that they are incident to the Houſe, ſo of Priviledg incident to a Copy-hold Eſtate by the Cuſtome, and at the Common Law, if Tenant for life hath cut the Trees, he: hath not forfeited his Eſtate, for he was truſted with the Land, <hi>and was not puniſhable till the Statute of Gloceſter,</hi> and at this day if there be a meſne Remainder for life which remains in Contingency, and that ſhall prevent that the Tenant ſhal be puniſhed for this waſte, and to make innovation of this cuſtome, will be dangerous, and for that he concluded that the Plaintiff ſhall be barred.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Warburton</hi> Juſtice agreed: And the firſt Cuſtome, that is, for <note place="margin">Warburton.</note> the nomination of the Succeſſor, he conceived that it is good, and that it is good by the Common Law, and good by Cuſtome by the Common Law, as a Leaſe for life, remainder to him which the Tenant for life ſhall name: So by Cuſtome as the Cuſtome, that if a Copy-holder will ſell his Copy-hold Eſtate, that he which is next of blood to him ſhall have the refuſall, and if none of his blood, then he which Inhabits in the neereſt part of the part of the ground ſhall have it before a ſtranger, giving for that as much as a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger would, and the Lord shall have him for his Tenant, whether he will or no, for it shall be intended, that ſo it was agreed at the firſt, and it is reaſonable; and if it had not been ruled and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged before, yet he conceived it might now be a rule and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, inſomuch that it is ſo reaſonable and good, and for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cuſtome, that is for the cuſtome of cutting of Trees, by ſuch Copy-holder which hath ſuch priviledge, he conceived alſo that it was good: But he agreed that a bare Tenant for life cannot be warranted by cuſtome to do ſuch an Act, as it was here adjudged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Powell and Peacock:</hi> But here he had a greater Eſtate then for life, for he hath power to make another Eſtate for life, and shall have as great priviledge as Tenant after poſſibility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is in reſpect of Inheritance which once was in him, and he may do it
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:41383:234"/>
for the poſſibility which he hath to give to another Eſtate, as it is agreed in 2. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. that a Leaſe fo a hundred yeares is Mortmain, in reſpect of the continuance of it, ſo here, for the Eſtate may continue by ſuch power of nomination for many lives in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity, and that as when at the Common Law they have in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and opinion of Law a greater Eſtate, may cut and ſell Trees, ſo here inſomuch that the Eſtate comes ſo neere to Inheritance, he conceived that he might cut the Trees by the cuſtome, and that the Cuſtome is good; and ſo he concluded, that Judgement ſhould be given, that the Plaintiff ſhould be barred in reſpect of Cuſtomes; and then to the third, that is, when a man lets Land, and by the ſame Deed, grants the Trees to be cut at the will and pleaſure of the grantee, there the Leſſee hath diſtinct Intereſt: But if the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor by one ſelfe ſame clauſe had demiſed the Land and the Trees, there the Intendment is: But notwithſtanding that there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall clauſes, and that he hath diſtinct Intereſts, yet he conceiveth that the Trees remaine parcell of the Inheritance and free-hold till they are cut and are ſevered only in Intereſt, that is, that may be felled and devided by the Axe, for Tythes ſhall not be paid for them if they exceed the growth of twenty yeares, not it shall not be Felony for to cut thoſe and burn them: And it is not like to an Advowſon, for that may be ſevered, and for that he conceived that if the Cuſtome had not warranted the Cutting and Selling, that the Copy-holder had forfeited his Eſtate, and that the Lord might very well have taken advantage of it, and 29. <hi>aſſiſ.</hi> 29. A man ſells Trees to be cut at <hi>Michaelmaſſe</hi> inſuing, and before <hi>Michaelmaſſe</hi> Haukes breed in them, the ſeller ſhall have them, by which it appeares that the property is not altered: So that though they are not parcell of the Mannor, yet they are parcell of the Free-hold, inſomuch that they are not ſevered <hi>in Facto:</hi> And he <hi>agreed that Leſſee for yeares</hi> of a Mannor ſhall take advantage of Forfeiture, and need not any preſentment by the Homage, and <hi>Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton fol.</hi> 15, ſaith, that the Lord may enter as in a thing Forfeited unto him; and ſo for attainder of Felony: And if a Copy-holder makes a Leaſe for yeares, by which he forfeits his Copy-hold E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate: And after the Lord grants the Mannor for yeares, the <hi>Leſſee</hi> of the Mannor ſhal take advantage of this Forfeiture made before he had any Eſtate in the Mannor without any preſentment by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage: But here in this caſe the Cuſtome warrants the cutting of the Trees by the Copy-holder, and for that he concluded all the matter as above, that the Plaintiff ſhould take nothing by his Writ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Coke</hi> cheife Juſtice agreed, and he ſaid that <hi>Forteſcue and Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Coke.</note>
                        <pb n="198" facs="tcp:41383:235"/>
and all others agreed, that the Common Law conſiſts of three parts.</p>
                     <p>Firſt Common Law.</p>
                     <p>Secondly Statute Law, which corrects, abridges, and exp'aines the Common Law: The third Cuſtome which takes away the Common Law: But the Common Law Corrects, Allows, and Diſallows, both <hi>Statute Law, and Cuſtome,</hi> for if there be repugnancy in <hi>Statute;</hi> or unreaſonableneſſe in Cuſtome, the Common Law Diſallowes and rejects it, as it appeares by Doctor <hi>Bonhams</hi> Caſe, and 8 <hi>Coke, 27. H. 6, Annuity:</hi> And he conceived that there are five differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Preſcription and a Cuſtome: And all thoſe as pertenent to this cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt in the beginning, <hi>Pugnant ex Diametro,</hi> for nothing may be good by preſcription, but that which may have beginning by grant, and alſo preſcription is incident to the Perſon, and Cuſtome to ſome place, and holds place in many Caſes, which cannot be by grant; as in 11, <hi>H.</hi> 4. Lands may be deviſed by Cuſtome, and ſo diſcent to all the Sons, as in Gavelkind, and to the youngeſt Son in <hi>Eurrough Engliſh,</hi> and others like, which cannot have their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning by Grant, but preſcription and Cuſtome are Brothers, and ought to have the ſame age, and reaſon ought to be the Father. and Congruence the Mother, and uſe the Nurſe, and time out of memory to Fortifie them both.</p>
                     <p>Secondly they vary in quality, for preſcription is for one man only, and Cuſtome is for many, if all but one be not dead.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly they vary in extent and latitude, for preſcription extends to Fee-ſimple only, but Cuſtome extends to all Intereſts and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates whatſoever, as appeares by pleading, for Tenant in tayl, for life or yeares cannot preſcribe in what Eſtate, nor againſt the Lord in his Demeſnes, but they ought to alledge the Cuſtome, and againſt a ſtranger they ought to preſcribe in the name of the Lord, and for that preſcription <hi>b.</hi> Copy-holder of Inheritance may ſell the Trees, is not good, but ſuch Cuſtome is good, and 5. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 24. And the old Reports 196. One Tenant being a Free-holder preſcribes to have Windfalls, and all Trees-which are withered in the Top and if the Lord makes them in Cole, to have ſo much in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: And ſo if they ſell, and this for Sale, and this was not-good, inſomuch that it is alledged in the perſon as preſcription, but if it had been alledged as Cuſtome, and to be burnt in his houſe, then it shall be good as appendant, and 14. <hi>Ed. 3. Barr 227. Wilby</hi> ſaith to be adjudged that preſcription to have Turbary to be burnt in his houſe is good, but not to ſell; and 11. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 17. accordingly, by which it appeares that this may be very well by Cuſtome, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be by preſcription.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="199" facs="tcp:41383:235"/>
Thirdly he conceived that where a man may create an Eſtate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out nomination, there he may create that by nomination: And alſo that which may be done by the Common Law, m<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> be done by Cuſtome, and that an Eſtate may be created by ſuch nomination, it appeares by the caſe, where a Remainder is Limited to him, which the firſt Tenant for life shall nominate, and it is very good, and to prove that the Cuſtome is good, he remembred the cuſtome <hi>of Millam in Norfolke,</hi> where he was borne, that is, that if any Copy-holder will ſell his Land and agree of the price, that at the next Court when a ſurrender is to be made, the next of his blood, and if he will not any other of his blood may have the Land, and ſo every one shall be preferred according to the neereneſſe of his blood, and with this alſo agreed the Leviticall Law, as it appeares, <hi>Leviticus</hi> 25. chap. verſe 15. which appoints this to be at the yeare of Jubile, and the Common Law within one yeare after the Alienation, and upon this he infers, that if Cuſtome may appoint Heire in the life of the party, then <hi>a Fortiore,</hi> he may appoint Succeſſor after his death, and he conceived that at the beginning, the Copy-holders might have had abſolute Fee-ſimple of the Lord, and they rather made choice to have ſuch Eſtate, inſomuch that they did not know, if their Children would be towardly or not, and for that content themſelves with the nomination of a Succeſſor only, and ſo is the Cuſtome at <hi>Hamm</hi> alſo in <hi>Middleſex,</hi> if any Copy-holder will ſell, the next <hi>Cleivener,</hi> which is he that dwelleth next unto him, ſhall have the refuſall, giving ſo much as another will, and he which Inhabits one the <hi>Eaſt</hi> part firſt, <hi>and the South and the Weſt, and laſt the North</hi> ſhall be preferred, is the only way in his courſe, and there the Succeſſor is nominated by the Heavens, and by the quarters of the Earth, and ſo is the cuſtome in <hi>Glocester:</hi> And if any Husband hath an Eſtate for twelve yeares, his Wife ſhall have it for twelve years alſo, and ſo <hi>ad Infinitum,</hi> and this makes nomination, and ſo of Free-hold, and ſo if it be good without nomination, it ſhall be good by nomination: And if the Eſtate determine by the Death of the Tenant, without nomination when the Lord revives the Copy-hold Eſtates, the priviledge alſo ſhall be revived: But he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the Tenant cannot nominate part to one and part to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor that divided in fractions: And he ſaith that this point hath been adjudged in the Kings Bench by foure Judges againſt <hi>Popham 5. Jacobi between Ball and Crabb:</hi> And ſo he concluded this point, and to the ſecond cuſtome he ſaid, he would ſpeake to that <hi>Tranſitive, but not Definitve,</hi> and that it hath been adjudged 45. <hi>Eliz. between Powell and Peacock</hi> that bare Copy holder for life, could not preſcribe to cut and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ell the Trees, otherwiſe of Tenant in Fee-ſimple, for he hath them cheriſhed and foſtered: And it is
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:41383:236"/>
againſt common reaſon, incongruent and againſt the Common Law, that a Copy-holder for life may cut and ſell the Trees, and cuſtome ought to have reaſon and congruence, for 10. <hi>Ed. 3. 5. Leete can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be belonging to a Church, inſomuch that it is Incongruent,</hi> and ſo in <hi>Writes</hi> Caſe 2. <hi>Coke</hi> Tythes cannot be appurtenant to a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, inſomuch that it is incongruent; and a ſpirituall thing ſhall not be pertinent to a temporall, and ſo <hi>è Converſo:</hi> And ſo in the 5. <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 9. and <hi>Hill and Granges</hi> Caſe, <hi>Com.</hi> Turbary cannon be appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant to Land, inſomuch that it is incongruent, but it ought to be to a houſe; ſo in time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. Tenant of the Mannor preſcribes to have free Bull and Bare, and it is not good for the reaſon afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, otherwiſe it is of the Lord of a Mannor, <hi>and 9 H.</hi> 5. 45. cuſtome in <hi>Leete</hi> to preſent common, and adjudged that it it is not good, inſouuch that it wants congruity, for it is not proper to the Court, and upon this he concluded that bare Tenant for life cannot preſcribe to cut Trees, for it is not congruent that ſuch an Eſtate ſhall have ſuch a priviledge, and this for three reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt inſomuch that Trees growing are parcell of the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly in reſpect of the perdurableneſſe of them, for it ſhall be intended that they will indure forever, and ſo will not his Eſtate, for this is as a ſhadow as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, and 'tis abſurd that ſhadow ſhould cut downe the Tree: And alſo it is for neceſſity of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Plow and Husbandry: And it is for the Common Wealth, that Copy-holder of Inheritanc might cut them by ſuch cuſtome, for otherwiſe he would not be incurraged, to plant and preſerve them: And notwithſtanding that in this Caſe the cuſtome be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, that the Copy-holder may cut down all, yet that shall have a reaſonable conſtruction, avd that this notwithſtanding he leave ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for Houſe-boot; as if a man grants Common without number, yet the Grantor shall not be excluded, but shall have his Common there, for exceſſe shall not be allowed.</p>
                     <p>As if a man which diſtraines another for Rent he ſhall not take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive diſtreſs, the <hi>Leſſee for life exceſſive Tallage of villaines,</hi> nor upon exceſſive Fines of Copy-holders, <hi>and ſo it was adjudged in Heyden and Sir John Lenthorps Caſe,</hi> that the Lord ſhall not take all; but leave ſufficient for reparations, and ſo was the opinion of <hi>Wray cheife Juſtice in the 33 of Eliz., In evidence to a Jury,</hi> but here he is in nature of Tenant in Fee-ſimple, and it ſhall be intended that he hath cheriſhed the Timber, <hi>and every Copy-holders Eſtate granted is as a new Grant, and hath affinity with Tenant in Fee-ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and he <hi>agreed that if Leſſee for</hi> life, the Remainder for years, Remainder for life be, and the firſt <hi>Leſſee</hi> for life makes a forfeiture, he in Remainder for years ſhall take advantage of that, and that it
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:41383:236"/>
hath been adjudged; that the Lord of the Mannor ſhall take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of forfeiture made by the Copy-holder, <hi>without preſentment made by the Homage,</hi> and in one <hi>Bacon and Flotſims Caſe,</hi> and ſo <hi>Leſſee for yeares of a Mannor ſhall take advantage of Forfeiture, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Imbicillity of his Eſtate,</hi> but the principall matter upon which he relyed was, that the <hi>Trees were ſevered from the Free-hold,</hi> and if the <hi>Leſſee</hi> dy, his Executors shall have them, inſomuch that they are meer Chattells, and this.</p>
                     <p>Firſt in reſpect of the Words of the Leaſe, that is, demiſe, and to farm let the Mannor, but bargain, ſell, give, and grant the Timber Trees to be felled and carried away at his Will: As if a man makes a <hi>Leaſe</hi> for years, except the Wood, and after grants the Trees, the Leaſe determines, the Leſſor ſhall not have the Trees again.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, They are in two divided Sentences, and alſo in reſpect of divided properties, <hi>for the Executor of the Leſſee ſhall have them; and Quando duo Jura, concurrunt in una perſona, equum eſt ac ſi eſſet in diverſis,</hi> alſo paſt at ſeverall times, for the Trees paſs by the delivery of the Deed, and the Land doth not paſs till Livery and Seiſin be made. Alſo the intent of the parties is not that they ſhall paſs together, for if the intent were otherwiſe the Law would not devide them, as <hi>it was adjudged Hillary 15. Eliz. in the Lord Cromwells caſe, where Tenant in Tayl was of a Mannor, with the Reverſion to his right Heirs, and he by his Deed gives and grants the Mannor, and the Reverſion of that,</hi> and includes Letter of Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney within the <hi>Deed</hi> to make Livery, but Livery was not made, and yet the Reverſion doth not paſs, for his intent appeares that it ſhould paſs by Livery and Seiſin, and not by grant; and alſo in <hi>Androwes caſe,</hi> the Advowſon appendant to a Mannor ſhall not paſs without inrolment of Bargaine and Sale, <hi>yet there were words there,</hi> that that might paſſe by Grant, for this was againſt their intent, otherwiſe if a man makes a Leaſe for life or years of a Mannor, and grants the Inheritance of the Advowſon by the ſame Deed, and ſo of the caſe of 23 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 374. Leſſor deviſeth, Grants, and to farm lets the Mannor and the Trees, and they paſſe joyntly; and the Reaſon is inſomuch that it is but a Joynt ſentence, and not ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall as it is here, alſo he intended, that the life of the Leſſee for life is not averred, and for that he ſhall be intended to be dead, and for that it is a ſeverall grant of the Trees of the Free-hold, for the Intereſt of them is ſetled in his Executors, for if he had made Sale of them before that the Copy-holder had cut them down, then that had not been forfeiture, ſee 5. H. 7. 15 <hi>Ed. 4. 14 Eliz. Dyer</hi> And then the Caſe is this, Tenant for anothers life of a Mannor, makes a Leaſe for yeares of the Free-hold, of which an Eſtranger hath a Copy-hold Eſtate for life in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> Leſſee dies,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:41383:237"/>
and he conceived that the Copy-holder ſhall not be an occupant, for it ought to be <hi>Vacua Poſſeſſio,</hi> and this was the reaſon of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Adams</hi> Caſe in 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Where a man makes a long Leaſe for years, and after intending to avoyd this Leaſe, makes a Leaſe to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther old man for anothers life, to the intent that the Leſſee for yeares ſhould be occupant, when the old Leſſee died, and ſo drowned his Tearm, and after the Leſſee died, and reſolved that the Leſſee for years shall not be an occupant, inſomuch that there was not <hi>Vacua Poſſeſſio,</hi> and for this it ſeems to him that if Leſſee for anothers life, makes a Leaſe for years and dyes, that the Leſſee for yeares shall not be an occupant, notwithſtanding that he made ſpeciall claim, and that for the reaſon aforeſaid, but he agreed that a Leſsee for anothers life makes a Leaſe at will and dies, there the Leſsee at Will shall be an Occupant, inſomuch that his Eſtate is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, and yet there is not <hi>Vacua Poſſeſſio,</hi> according to 38 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 27. But he did not ſay there ſhould be an occupant in theſe caſes, but cyted <hi>Bracton fol.</hi> 8. that if the Sea leave an Iſland in the midſt of that, the King ſhall have it, and not <hi>Occupanti conceditur,</hi> and ſo <note place="margin">Quod non oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupantur con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceditur.</note> he concluded that the Plaintiff ſhall be barred, and that Judgment shall be entred for the Defendant, which was done accordingly, and it was afterwards agreed, upon motion in this caſe, whether it would not make difference if the Trees were cut by the Copy-holder before that he hath made his nomination or not, notwithſtanding it was objected, that when he hath made his nomination, then he was only bare Tenant for life, and the Priviledge executed, and he in Remainder was alſo Tenant for life only, for he cannot nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate till he comes to be Tenant in poſſeſſion, but this notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, inſomuch that they had power to make nomination, that is the firſt Tenant again, if the ſecond died in his life time, and the ſecond if the firſt died in his life time, and ſo the Peiviledge conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, all the Juſtices continued of their opinions, and according to that Judgment was entred for the Defendant, and that the Plaintiff should be barred, and should take nothing by his Writ.</p>

                     <p>Secondly reall preſcription, and this is Inherent to the Eſtate, and this is where a man preſcribeth that he and all thoſe whoſe Eſtate he hath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, locall preſcriptions an that is, where a man preſcribes to have a thing appendant or appurtenant to his Mannor, and this is ſo fixed to the Land, that whether ſoever the Land goes, the preſcription is concommitant unto it, and it ſeemes to him that this common is annexed to the Land by preſcription and ſo locall, and cannot be ſeperated but alwaies shall go with the Land, into who ſoever hands that comes, (but <hi>Dixit non Probant:)</hi> And for this he ſuppoſed that the cuſtome of Copy-hold is that the Copy-hold shall diſcend to the youngeſt Son, if the Copy holder purchaſe the Free-hold and the Fee-ſimple of the Copy-hold, ſo that this is made Free-hold, this shall diſcend to the youngeſt Son; ſo if a Copy-holder by cuſtome is diſcharged of payment of Tythes in kind, ſo the office of the maſter of the Rolles hath many liberties pertaining to it, and this is granted but <hi>Durante placito,</hi> yet if the King grant that in Fee as he may, yet he shall have all the Fees and Priviledges annexed to that, and ſo it ſeemes to him that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon being annexed to the Land, though that the Eſtate be increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:41383:241"/>
yet the common remaines, his ſecond reaſon was of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of conveiance, and that was by confirmation, and if that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiance had been by Feoffment, peradventure the common had been gone: But a confirmation enures allwaies upon an Eſtate precedent, and though that this ſomtimes inlargeth the Eſtate, yet this doth not alter the Eſtate, as to any priviledges annexed to it, his third reaſon was of the matter of the confirmation, and that is; that he hath confirmed it with the appurtenances, and this ſeemes to him, admitting that the common had been extinct, yet theſe words with the appurtenances amount to a new grant of a common, as in the caſe of <hi>Corody, in 22, Ed. 4. 17. and</hi> 18. If the King grant to one ſuch a Corody as <hi>I. S.</hi> had, he shall have ſo much bread and beere as <hi>I. S.</hi> had, ſo here when he grants and confirmes that with the appurtenances, this is with all ſuch privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges as <hi>I. S.</hi> had; ſo here when he confirmes with the appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, this is with all the priviledges that the old Eſtate had, and ſo this should be a grant of ſuch common as was annexed to that, and ſo it ſeemed to him for theſe reaſons that the common remaines; to which it was ſaid by <hi>Davies</hi> of the other part, that he agreed al the manners of Preſcriptions, but he denied that it was a locall Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is to Land, but only to an Eſtate, and this proves well the words of the Preſcription, for the Copy-holder ought to preſcribe, that is, that every cuſtomary Tenant within the Mannor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So he hath his common in reſpect that he is cuſtomary Tenant, and this is in reſpect of the Eſtate which he hath by the Cuſtome, and not in reſpect of the Land, and that this ſhall not enure as a new Grant, he cited a caſe to be adjudged <hi>Michaelmaſſe</hi> 43. and 44. <hi>Eliz. in</hi> the Kings Bench, <hi>Rot.</hi> 367, Where in Treſpaſſe, the Defendant juſtifies the lopping of Trees in the waſt of the Lord, where the cuſtome was that every Copy-holder might ſhride the Trees in the waſt of the Lord, and that he was a Copy-holder there, and the Lord granted to him the Inheritance of his Copy-hold, with all ſuch Lands, Tenements, and Commons of Eſtovers pertaining to the Copy-hold, and adjudged that inſomuch that the Cuſtomary Eſtate was diſtroied, this cuſtome was not now annexed to the Land, but being determined with the Eſtate cannot be ſaid appertaining to it, and for that the Juſtification ill; and it ſeemed to him to be all one with the principall caſe and it was adjourned, and after in <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſe</hi> Tearme 8. <hi>Jacobi,</hi> It was adjudged that the Common was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and not revived.</p>

                        <pb n="214" facs="tcp:41383:243"/>
to him, <hi>that it is au expreſſe Covenant,</hi> in this Caſe as well as in other, <hi>and qualifies the generall Covenant,</hi> implyed by the word <hi>(Grant) and then the Grantee</hi> being outed by a <hi>title Paramount,</hi> no Action of Debt upon ſuch Obligation, and prayed that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be reverſed, and the Juſtices ſayd they would conſider <hi>Nokes Caſe, and the next day their opinions were prayed again,</hi> and the <hi>cheife Juſtice ſayd that he had ſeen Nokes caſe, and ſaid, that there is but a ſmall difference between the caſes,</hi> but he ſayd that ſome difle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may be collected.</p>
                     <p>For firſt in our caſe, is a Recitall of the <hi>Eſtate of the Grantor, that is, that all belongs to him as Survivor,</hi> and for that this was a <hi>manner of Inducement of the Grantee to be more willing, and forward to accept of the Grant,</hi> and to give the more greater conſideration for it, but in <hi>Nokes caſe there is no recitall,</hi> and ſo this may be the diverſity.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>In Nokes Caſe,</hi> the <hi>Tearm</hi> paſt all in Intereſt at the firſt, <hi>and the Grantee or Leſſee,</hi> had once the effect of this Leaſe in Intereſt of the Leſſor, but in this caſe when two Tenants in Common, and one grants <hi>Totum molendinum, there paſſes</hi> but a half at the firſt, and ſo the grant is not ſupplyed for the other halfe, and then if the ſpeciall <hi>Covenant ſhall qualify the generall, &amp;c. The Grantee ſhall</hi> not have any remedy for a half at all, and this may be the other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, <hi>but admitting that none of theſe will make any difference,</hi> then he ſayd that all the Court agreed, that this point in <hi>Nokes Caſe</hi> was not adjudged, but this was a matter ſpoken collaterally in the caſe, and the caſe was adjudged againſt <hi>the Plaintiff for other reaſons, for that that he</hi> did not ſhew that he which evicted this Tearm had <hi>title Paramount,</hi> for otherwiſe <hi>the Covenant in Law</hi> was not broken, and for this reaſon Judgment was given againſt the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and not upon the other matter, and ſo the whole Court againſt <hi>Nokes Caſe:</hi> And the cheif Juſtice ſayd, <hi>that to that</hi> which is ſayd in <hi>Nokes caſe,</hi> that otherwiſe the ſpeciall <hi>Covenant</hi> ſhall be of no effect, if it cannot qualify the generalty of the <hi>Covenant</hi> in <hi>Law,</hi> he ſayd that this ſerves well to this purpoſe, <hi>that is,</hi> that if the Leſſor dyes, and any under the Teſtator claim the Eſtate, <hi>that the Action of Covenant in this caſe</hi> lies againſt his Executors, which remedy otherwiſe he cannot have, for if a man makes a Leaſe by theſe words <hi>(Deviſe and Grant)</hi> and dyes, Action of Covenant doth notly againſt his Executors, as it is ſayd in <hi>the 9. Eliz. Dyer 257. But otherwiſe upon expreſſe Covenant,</hi> and then this <hi>expreſſe ſpeciall Covenant ſhall be to this purpoſe.</hi> And alſo <hi>it ſeems</hi> to him <hi>that</hi> if a man deviſe and grant his Land for years, and <hi>there are other Covenants in the Deed,</hi> that in this caſe if the Leſſor binds himſelf to perform all <hi>Covenants,</hi> that he is not bound by his Bond to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:41383:243"/>
Covenants in Law, and he cited that to this purpoſe <hi>the Books</hi> of 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. and 6 <hi>Ed. 6. B. Tender,</hi> that if a man makes a <hi>Leaſe for yeares rendring Rent,</hi> this is Covenant in Law, as it is ſayd, 15 <hi>H. 8. Dyer,</hi> and a man ſhall have Debt or Covenant for that, and yet if a man binds himſelf in a Bond to perform all Covenants <hi>where there are other Covenants in the Deed,</hi> and after doth not pay the Rent, no action of Debt lyeth upon this Obligation, nor the nature of the Debt altered by that, and he ſayd <hi>that the Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day next,</hi> they would pronounce Judgment in <hi>the Writ</hi> of Errour accordingly, if nothing ſhall be ſayd to the contrary, and nothing was ſayd.</p>

                        <hi>of the Church,</hi> and the Wardens of the Church ſued for this Taxation in <hi>the ſpirituall Court:</hi> and hanging this Suit, one of <hi>the Wardens releaſed to the Defendant all Actions, Suits, and Demands,</hi> and the other ſued forward, and upon this <hi>the Defendant there</hi> procured a Prohibition, upon which matter ſhewed in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition was a Demurre joyned, <hi>and Davenport of Grayes Inne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Court for a Conſultation,</hi> and upon all the matter as he ſayd the point was but this, If two Wardens of a Church are, and they ſue in the Court Chriſtian for Taxation and one Releaſe, if that shal barr his Companion or not. And it ſeems to him that this <hi>Releaſe</hi> shall not be any Barr to his Companion or Impediment to ſue, for he ſayd, <hi>that the Wardens</hi> of a Church are not parties intereſted in Goods of the Church, but are a ſpeciall Corporation to the Benefit of the Church, <hi>and for that he cited the Caſe in 8 Ed.</hi> 4. 6.

<pb n="216" facs="tcp:41383:244"/>
cannot releaſe, but this tax for which they ſue is a thing meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Action of which they have not any poſſeſſion of that before, and there he cannot ſue alone, and for that this releaſe ſhall barr his Companion. And the Court interrupted him, and ſayd, that cleerly <hi>conſultation ſhall be granted,</hi> and <hi>Flemming cheife Juſtice, we have not need to diſpute this releaſe,</hi> whether it be good or not, and there is a difference where a ſuit is commenced before us, as if Wardens of the Church brought Treſpaſſe here for Goods of the Church taken, and one Releaſe, then we might diſpute if this releaſe were good or not, but when the matter is original begun before them in the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Court, and there is the proper place to ſue for this Tax and not any where elſe, we have nothing to do with this Releaſe, <hi>and for that by the whole Court, a conſultation was awarded.</hi>

That if a man make a Feoffment upon condition, that the Feoffee ſhall not commit Felony, that this is a good condition,</hi> but he ſayd, that he ſuppoſed <hi>that if the Feoffee commit Felony,</hi> and the Feoffor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Land, <hi>and after the Feoffee is attaint of this felony,</hi> that now the Lord shall enter by Eſcheate, and his reaſon was, <hi>that the Statute of Weſtminſter 3. De quia emptores terrarum, prohibits any man to make a Feoffment, to the prejudice of the Lord, to his Wardſhip or Eſcheat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His third reaſon was, that this was a good Cuſtome, inſomuch that this was annexed to an Eſtate created by cuſtome, and for that he <hi>cited one Skeggs caſe to be adjudged in 24 yeare of Eliz. and was thus,</hi> that is, The cuſtome of a Mannor was, that a marryed wife Copy-holder might ſurrender to the uſe of her laſt will, and after might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe to her Husband, and it was adjudged, inſomuch that this was annexed <hi>to her Eſtate which begun by cuſtome,</hi> this was a good cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and <hi>the 3 of Ed. 3. At the common Law ſuch cuſtome is voyd,</hi> and after he cited a Judgment in the point given in this Court, 23. of <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 5014. or 504 or 5004. that the ſame cuſtome was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged a good Cuſtome: after he anſwered ſome objections which might be made againſt this cuſtome, that is.</p>
                     <p>Firſt for the uncertainty of the time when the preſentment ſhall be by the Homage, and to that he ſayd that the Lord may make that when he will, and the time doth not take away the offence, and no prejudice upon that diſcends to the Heir, but is to his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Becauſe no number certaine of the Homage, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:41383:245"/>
that every tryall muſt be by twelve, and to that he anſwered, that we are not now in point of Tryall, but only for the information of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this is againſt the nature of a Court-Baron to inquire of Felonies, <hi>and to that he ſaid, there is not any inquiry made here, but only to inform the Lord,</hi> and ſuch a thing is not againſt the nature of the Court which inlargeth this.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, The offence is againſt the King, and a common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhall not have the puniſhment of that, <hi>to that he ſayd the King ſhall not have any benefit of it,</hi> for he ſhall not have any Eſcheat of Copy-hold lands for Treaſon or Felony.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, This is againſt the Kings Prerogative, <hi>to that he ſayd, that Cuſtome may be againſt the Prerogative of the King,</hi> as if a man claim Waife or ſtray by preſcription, theſe are things given to the King by his Prerogative, and yet Preſcription for them is good, and ſo he concluded this firſt point, that the cuſtome was good.</p>
                     <p>To the ſecond point he conceived, that this verdict and acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall ſhall not conclude the Lord, <hi>and for that he ſayd, that at the Common Law, if a Verdict had been given and no Judgment upon it,</hi> the party was not concluded to bring the ſame Action, 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 35. Then comes <hi>the Statute of 2 H.</hi> 4. And this outs non-ſuit after ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, <note place="margin">Nonſuit after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Verdict.</note> and yet if verdict be imperfect, or finds a thing not in Iſſue, there non-ſuit may be after verdict, as it is ſayd in 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 10. And if verdict be given in the point, and Judgment upon that, doth not conclude the party to have action of more high nature, as it is ſayd in 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and 3 <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> 1. and <hi>Hudſons eaſe in the 4 Coke,</hi> and as it is in Tryalls of Land, ſo it is in tryalls of life, as 2 <hi>R. 3. 14. 7 H.</hi> 4. 34. Then if the party himſelf ſhall not be bound by verdict, <hi>A for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiori,</hi> a ſtranger ſhall not be, alſo every Eſtoppell <hi>there ought to be a matter of eſtoppell,</hi> for the Jury is not ſworn to give their verdict ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the truth in Deed, but according to the evidence to them given, and then if faint evidence or no evidence be given, it ſhall be hard <hi>that this ſhall conclude any of his right,</hi> alſo there is no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to be eſtopped becauſe a ſtranger as is aforeſayd, alſo the acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall is in ſuch manner, <hi>that is, that he hath not committed the Felony in manner and form as in the Indictment is alledged,</hi> and this doth not anſwer the Cuſtome, becauſe generall, <hi>ſo it ſeems to him, that this ſhall not be any concluſion to the Lord, and ſo for both points the entry not congeable.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Stevens to the contrary, and it ſeems to him</hi> breifly <hi>that the</hi> cuſtome was not good, and he denyed the Rule, <hi>that is, that this might have reaſonable beginning by agreement</hi> of parties ſhall make a cuſtome good, <hi>and for this Littleton ſaith in his chapter of villainage,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:41383:246"/>
that if the Lord of one Mannor will preſcribe to have Fine,</hi> if any of his Tenants marry their Daughters without his licenſe, this is a void cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, <hi>and yet it may be ſuch agreement between the parties at the firſt,</hi> and it ſeems the cuſtome not reaſonable, <hi>for it is too generall, that</hi> is; if any Tenant, and this doth not exclude Infants.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if any Felony be <hi>committed,</hi> and this includes petty Larceny, and Maime by involuntary means, for theſe are Felonies, <hi>and for that ſee, 13 H. 7. 19. 6 H.</hi> 7. That in Appeal of Mayme, a man ſhall count Felony, and yet it ſhall be hard that a man ſhall looſe his Land for theſe Felonies. Secondly, Homage cannot inquire of the fact of Felony, but of the conviction of Felony, <hi>and ſo it ſeems to him the cuſtome ill, and to the other point it ſeems that the Lord ſhall be concluded, and to that that hath been objected that the Lord is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the verdict, and for that cauſe ſhall not be eſtopped, he ſaid that the Lord is no ſtranger,</hi> for in this caſe every man is party, and every man may give Evidence for the King, <hi>and he cited the caſe in the time and title of Mortdancester,</hi> where the caſe was, where a man was as principall for the Death of <hi>J. S. and another as acceſſary in receiving the Principall,</hi> after the principall was out-Lawed, and the Acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hanged, and the Lord ſeiſed the Land of the Acceſſary for Eſcheat, after came the principall and reverſed the Out-Lawry, and was found not guilty, and the Heir of him which was hang'd, entred upon the Lord, <hi>and adjudged,</hi> inſomuch, <hi>that there cannot be an Acceſſary,</hi> unleſs there be a principall; that the entry of the Heir was lawfull in this caſe, ſo he ſayd in this caſe, inſomuch that the Copy-holder is acquitted by verdict and found not guilty, <hi>and ſeems to him that the entry of the Lord ſhould not be lawfull,</hi> and by the whole Court the cuſtome was good, but they did not deliver any opinion upon the ſecond point, for they moved the parties to Compoſition.</p>

                     <p>Thirdly, The third point was, that after the diſſeiſin of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life, he that had future Intereſt of a Tearme to begin after the death of the Leſsee for life (during the diſſeiſin) aſſignes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all his Intereſt, if this aſſignement be good or not, and he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued that not, for by him the diſſeiſin of the Tenant for life, the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:41383:249"/>
future Intereſt to commence after the death of the Tenant for life, is converted into a Right, and Right of a Tearme cannot be transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over, for though that Leſsee for years to begin preſently, may grant over his Intereſt before his Entry, and it is well for that, that it is an Intereſt forth with, yet if before his Entry the Leſsor be diſſeiſed by a ſtranger, yet by him now, he cannot grant his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt over for that, it is converted into a Right of a Tearme, but he ought to re-enter before that the Leſsee may grant over his Tearme, ſo in our caſe, though that before the diſſeiſin of the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee for life the future Intereſt was transferrable over, for that, that it was Intereſt, though that it was not a Leaſe in poſaeſſion, yet when the Tenant for life was diſſeiſed then his Intereſt of a Tearme was turned into a Right of a Tearme, and then it is not transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able over till the re-entry by the Leſsee for life, and he ſaid that it was reſolved by the 2. cheif Juſtices in the Star-chamber as he hath heard, that if Leſsee for years be, and before his entry a ſtranger enters, and diſseiſes the Leſsor, that now the Leſsee cannot grant his Tearme before that the Leſsor hath entred, or he himſelfe hath gained the Tearme in poſaeſſion: And ſo it ſeemes to him, that the future Tearme doth not paſse by this aſſignement, and then it is extinguiſhed by the purchaſe which commeth after, and then the Juſtification of the Defendant as Servant to the Aſſignees not good: And ſo upon all the matter he praied Judgement for the Plaintiff.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Williams</hi> Juſtice ſaid, that it was cleer, if a man have a Leaſe for years, to begin after the death of a Leſſee for life, as is the caſe at the Barr, that though that the Leſſee for life be diſseiſed, yet the Intereſt remaines good Intereſt to the Leſsee, and is not turned into a Right of a Tearme, and for that he may grant it over, notwithſtanding the diſseiſin, and ſo is <hi>Sapphins</hi> caſe 5. <hi>Coke</hi> 104. Otherwiſe if the Leſsee for years had been any time in poſaeſſion by force of his Leaſe, and it is Adjourned.</p>
                     <p>At another day the ſame Tearme the caſe was argued againe by <hi>Yelverton</hi> of <hi>Grayes Inne</hi> of the other part, that is for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, and firſt he ſaid that the Plaintiff which claimes under the Wife, of <hi>Hlobeame</hi> hath not any right to one <hi>Moytie</hi> cleerely, for the Husband and the Wife were Joynt-Tenants before the cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: So that they take by <hi>Moyties</hi> and not by Intirities, and when the Husband bargaines and ſells all, that is a ſeperation of the Joyntenancy, and his Moytie is gone for ever, as it appeares by 3. <hi>M. Dyer</hi> 149. 82. So that for one moytie it is cleer, that the Plaintiff hath not any right any way, how ever the caſe prove, for the other Moytie, and this Moytie which was conveied by the Husband is diſcended to the Defendant, which hath no ſpeciall
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:41383:249"/>
outer found by the Verdict: But only that he entered which he well might, having the other halfe, and then no Treſpaſse found by the Jury, and alſo the Damages found by the Jury are Intire, and then being no cauſe of Damages for part, there ſhall be no Judgement for the reſidue: And the firſt point that he moved was, if after this diſseiſin and feoffment over, the Feoffor might tender the money to ceaſe the firſt Eſtate, and it ſeemes that not, for the Free-hold cannot accrue, as it ſeemes to him by any tender after his diſseiſin, and ſo it hath been agreed to him as he ſaid by the Councell of the other part, and then by him this condition conſiſting of two parts, this is Diſseiſin of one Eſtate and Accruing of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Eſtate, if by this deſseiſin the condition be diſtroied, for the accruing of the Eſtate, it ſeemes alſo that it ſhall be diſtroied as to the ceaſing of the firſt Eſtate; for if a condition be diſtroied in part it ſhall be diſtroied in all, for it is Intire and cannot be apportioned, and by conſequence if one Eſtate cannot accrue, the other ſhall not ceaſe: And he reſembled it to the cafe in the 14. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 17. And <hi>Perkins,</hi> condition being in the Coppulative one part being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced with the other, was a diſcharge, ſo when a man hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection to do one of two things, if one be diſcharged (though that it be by the Act of God) as by death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet the other ſhall be diſcharged by the Law, as it was in <hi>Langtons</hi> Caſe 5. <hi>Coke 22. a Fortiore</hi> when one is diſcharged by the Act of the party, alſo by him if he had made any Feoffment after this deſseiſin, yet the very diſseiſin would deſtroy the accruing of the Eſtate, for though that he do not gaine Fee by the diſseiſin but only Eſtate for life, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines his old reverſion in him, according to 9. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 25. Yet the Fee and the Free-hold are ſo conjoyned by diſcent of that Eſtate alters an entry, as it appeares by 3. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Entry Congeable 58. And if he in reverſion diſseiſe Tenant for life, the Contingent uſes shall never riſe, by <hi>Chidleys</hi> Caſe firſt of <hi>Coke</hi> 158. Condition that he retaine his old remainder, no more of the accruing of the Fee in our Caſe, for by him it appeares by 10. <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> and <hi>Nicholls Caſe Com.</hi> That Eſtate ought to accrue upon poſaeſſion, or at leaſt upon an Eſtate in being, and not upon a right of an Eſtate only: And for that he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 6. <hi>R. 2. Pleaſingtons</hi> Caſe, Leaſe for years upon condition, that if the Leſsee be outed he shall have Fee, though that he be ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted yet he shall not have Fee, for that, that at the time of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition performed he had but a right of Tearme, and no Tearme in poſaeſſion, ſo is our caſe after the diſseiſin, he having but right the Eſtate cannot accrue.</p>
                     <p>Secondly if the Grantee, or he to whoſe uſe, may performe the Condition, either by the Common Law, or by <hi>Statute</hi> Law: And he conceived that none of theſe might performe that, for firſt at
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:41383:250"/>
the common Law, though that Grantees of reverſions may take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a Condition by way of ceſser of Eſtates, upon the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion performed, yet this is only when the condition was to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the part of the Leſsee, and ſo was the caſe cited by Serjeant <hi>Nicholls</hi> of 11 H. 7. but if the condition were of the part of the Leſſor, otherwiſe it was, as the Book is in 26 <hi>H.</hi> 6. Entries. And then a <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiori</hi> here, the Aſſignee of a Diſseiſor cannot performe the condition, which may be performed of the part of the Leſsor.</p>
                     <p>But he agreed the caſe of <hi>Littleton,</hi> that an Aſſignee of an Eſtate may perform a condition in preſervation of an Eſtate, otherwiſe of an Aſſignee of a Reverſion, in deſtruction of an Eſtate, ſo at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law it is clear, that the Feoffee cannot perform the condition, and by him it is cleerly out of the <hi>Statute of 32 H.</hi> 8. for this <hi>Statute</hi> doth not extend to a collaterall condition, as it appears by <hi>Spencers caſe 5. Coke,</hi> and ſo hath been many times after this adjudged, and this is a collaterall condition, <hi>Ergo, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo concluded, and prayed Judgment for the Defendant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Nicholls</hi> Serjeant to the contrary, and that this Diſſeiſin hath not ſuſpended the condition, but that he may pay the Money, and make the Eſtate to ceaſe notwithſtanding the Diſſeiſin, for-that, that the condition is collaterall, like to the 20 of <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. and 20 <hi>H.</hi> 7. That where a Feoffee upon a collaterall condition takes back an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate for years, yet this ſhall not ſuſpend the condition, but it may be performed or broken, notwithſtanding the Leaſe, for that that it is collaterall, ſo in our caſe, for ſuppoſe that the condition had been if he marry Miſtris <hi>Holbeam,</hi> that then his Eſtate shall ceaſe, and as well it shall be upon the Tender of the Money here, and he ſaid that this caſe was late in the Common Bench. This feoffment was made to the uſe of the Feoffor for life, Remainder to another for life, the Remainder to the third in tayl, the Remainder to the right Heirs of the Feoffor in fee, with power of Revocation, and after the Feoffor lets for years, and during the Tearm he revokes the meſne Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and it ſeems to the Juſtices that well he may, for that that the Leaſe for years goes only out of the Eſtate for life, as he ſayd, and for that the power of Revocation as to the Meſne Remainders was not ſuſpended, <hi>Quere</hi> of the truth of this caſe in the common Bench, for perchance it is not truly collected, but ſo entred, and ſo he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Judgment for the Plaintiff.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Flemming</hi> cheife Juſtice ſayd, that the point of the principall caſe would be, if by the wrong of the Leſſor the Eſtate of the Leſsee shall be prevented to accrue, then he might perform the condition to determine the ancient Eſtate, that is, the Leaſe for years, and it is adjourned,</p>

                     <p>IN a Writ of Errour, the Earle of <hi>Rutland</hi> brought an Aſſiſe of <note place="margin">Errour.</note> Novel Diſſeiſin againſt the Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> and four others, and the Plaint was of the office of the keeping of the Park of <hi>Clep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and of the vailes and fees of the ſayd Parke, and of the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage and Paunage of the ſame, and the Demandant made his title, and alledged that the <hi>Queen Eliz.</hi> was ſeiſed of <hi>Clepſam</hi> Park in fee in right of her Crown, and that ſhe being ſo ſeiſed by her Letters Patents under the great Seal, granted unto one <hi>Markham</hi> the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Park of <hi>Clepſon;</hi> with the vailes and fees; and the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage and Paunage of the ſame Park for his life, after the Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> reciting the Grant made to <hi>Markham,</hi> and that <hi>Markham</hi> was alive, gave and granted by her Letters Patents, to the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> the Office of the keeping of the ſayd <hi>Clepſon</hi> Parke, with the Fees and Wages to that appertaining; to have and to hold to him for his life, after the death of <hi>Markham</hi> or after the ſurrender, or forfeiture of his Letters Patents, and further granted the Herbage and Paunage to the ſayd Earle of <hi>Rutland</hi> for his life, and doth not ſay when this ſhall begin, after which the Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> died, and the Eee-ſimple diſcended to our Lord the King, which-now is as lawfull Heir to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which granted that to the Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> after which <hi>Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> dyed, and the Earle of <hi>Rutland</hi> entered, and was ſeiſed till the Earle of <hi>Shewsbury</hi> with four others entered upon him, and diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, and to that the Tenants alledged no wrong no diſſeiſin, and when the Aſſiſe was to be taken in the Country, the Array was challenged by the Tenants, for that that one of the Tenants in the Aſſiſe, had an Action of Treſpaſſe hanging againſt the Sheriff, and this challenge was not allowed, and the Aſſiſe being peruſed at large for the Herbage and Paunage, they found, that the ſaid Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> was ſeiſed of <hi>Clepſon</hi> Park as aforeſaid, and by her Letters Patents as afore is rehearſed, granted the Keeping of this to <hi>Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> for his life, and further by the ſame Letters Patents granted to him the Fees and Wages to that belonging, and further granted by Letters Patents, and doth not ſay <hi>(Eaſdem)</hi> to him, the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage and Paunage of the ſayd Park, and that the Queen after the reciting the Grant made to <hi>Markham,</hi> and that <hi>Markham</hi> was alive, granted to the Earle of <hi>Rutland</hi> the keeping of the ſayd Park and vailes and fees, to have and to hold after the death, ſurrender, or forfeiture of the Letters Patents of <hi>Markham</hi> for his life. And
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:41383:251"/>
further by the ſayd Letters Patents, ſhee granted the Herbage and Paunage of the ſame Park to him for his life, as more fully appears by the Letters Patents, and it was not expreſſed, as to the Herbage and Paunage when that began, and they found the death of <hi>Mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and that the Earle of <hi>Rutland</hi> put two Horſes into the ſayd Park to take ſeiſin of the ſayd Herbage and Paunage, and they found further the grant of the King to the Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> of the fee-ſimple, and of that prayed the adviſe of the Court, and to the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Park they found the ſeiſin and diſſeiſin of that, and of the fees and wages to the Dammages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this being adjourned into the Common Bench, was remanded into the Country, and there Judgment was given for all for the Demandant, and after this it came into the Kings Bench by Writ of errour, and the Errours aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the councell of the Tenants, and argued at the Barr were foure.</p>
                     <p>The firſt was that the Earle of <hi>Rutland</hi> himſelf, between the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict and the Judgment hunted in the Park and kild a Buck, and took a ſhoulder of that for his fee, and ſo he hath abated his Aſſiſe, and ſo the Judgment was given upon a Writ abated, and therefore they cannot plead that in abatement, inſomuch that it was meſne betwixt the Judgment and the verdict, they aſſigned that for er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond was, becauſe the principall challenge was not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, where that ought to have beene allowed, and the challenge was, that one of the Tenants had an Action or Treſpaſſe hanging againſt the Sheriff before the Aſſiſe.</p>
                     <p>The third was, Becauſe the Jury have found the Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents made to <hi>Markham,</hi> and that the Queen granted to him by her Letters Patents the cuſtody of the Parke of <hi>Clepſon in Clepſon.</hi> And further by the ſame Letters Patents granted the vailes and fees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And further granted the Herbage and Paunage, and have not found that this was granted by the ſame Letters Patents, and then if this be not granted by the ſame Letters Patents, then there is not any grant of this to the Earle of <hi>Rutland,</hi> becauſe there is no receitall of the Patent by which the Herbage and Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage was granted to <hi>Markham.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The fourth errour was, that they have erred in point of Law, and to that the point is but this, the King grants the Herbage and Paunage of a Park to one for life, and after reciting that grant, and that the Patentee is alive, grants that to another, and doth not ſay when that ſhall begin, and it ſeems to them that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for the Plaintiffes in the Writ of errour, that this was a voyd grant, and ſo the Judgment erronious, but I have not the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:41383:251"/>
Report of the Arguments of the Conncellors at the Barr, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Judges, which moved two other errours in the caſe, not moved by the councell at the Barr, and <hi>Crooke</hi> Juſtice rehearſed the caſe as before.</p>
                     <p>And to the firſt errour he conceived that this is no errour, and that for two reaſons,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, He tooke a difference betweene a thing which abates the Writ by Plea, as if a man brings an Aſſiſe againſt another, and <note place="margin">Abatement of a Writ by entry.</note> meſne between verdict and Judgment, the Plaintiff dies, this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall abate the Writ without Plea, and for that if Judgment be given upon ſuch verdict, the Judgment is erronious, but in our caſe an entry doth not abate the Writ without pleading that, and now as this caſe is, this cannot be pleaded, being between Verdict and Judgment, and for that it ſhall not be aſſigned for Errour, ſee 19 <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> 8, Where this difference is taken, and agreed.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Admit that this entry might have abated the Writ in <hi>Facto</hi> without Plea, yet there is no ſuch entry alledged, which might abate the Writ in <hi>Facto</hi> without Plea, for the entry is alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> entred to hunt, and kild a Buck, and took a ſhoulder of that for his fee, and it ſeems that this is no ſuch entry that ſhall abate the writ, for he hath now entred to another purpoſe to hunt, the which he could not do, but the entry ought to have been alledged that he entred to keep, for in every entry the intent of the Entry is to be regarded, and to this purpoſe he cited the caſe of Aſſiſe of <hi>Freſhforce, Com. 92. and</hi> 93. Where entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Seller hanging the Aſſiſe of that, to ſee the Antiquity of the Houſe, there was no Entry to abate the Writ and the caſe of 26 <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſe</hi> 42. where the Diſſeiſee, hanging the Aſſiſe comes and ſets his foot upon the Land, but takes no profits, and adjudged that he ſhould recover notwithſtanding, ſo in this caſe the intent is not ſhewed, that is, that he entred to keep poſſeſſion but to hunt, nor was it ſuch entry which ſhould abate the writ, and to that which is ſayd that he kild a Buck, and took the ſhoulder of that for his fee, this doth not help, for if that had been a Buck which he might to have kild by vertue of his Office, he ought to have ſhewed his warrant, for otherwiſe a Parker cannot kill a Buck if not that it be for his fee, and then he ſhall have the Buck, and not a ſhoulder only, alſo it is alledged that he took a ſhoulder, and doth not ſay the beſt shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or the right shoulder, and this ought to be shewed in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
                     <p>And ſo for he firſt Errour he couceived that this is no cauſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the Judgment, and to the challenge he ſayd, that he would ſpeake to that at the laſt, and for that he now ſpake to the errours ſuppoſed in the grant.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="232" facs="tcp:41383:252"/>
And firſt to <hi>Markhams</hi> Grant, where the Jury found the Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> granted to him the keeping of the Park, and by the ſame Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">Markhams Grant.</note> Patents grant the fees and Wages, and further granted by her Letters Patents, and doth not ſay <hi>(Eaſdem)</hi> the Herbage and Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, it ſeems to him that this is very well, for two reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, inſomuch that there is a copulative, which is this word <hi>(Et)</hi> and alſo a Relative, which is this word <hi>(<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lterius)</hi> and this word conjoynes the matter precedent with the ſubſequent, and the word <hi>(<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lterius)</hi> hath neceſſary relation to the ſame Letters Patents, and ſo <hi>Ex precedentibus &amp; ſubſequentibus,</hi> the Iury hath well found the matter.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, theſe words are ſupplied in the ſecond Patent, for there the Jury have found that the Queene hath granted that to <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> by the ſame <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> and ſo for theſe two reaſons he <note place="margin">Earle of Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands Patent.</note> concluded that this is no Error to reverſe the Judgement: And to the Patent made to the Earle of <hi>Rutland,</hi> it ſeemes to him alſo, that this is very good, and all that he ſaid in effect was, that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Patents of the King, ſuch expoſition is to be made, that if any reaſonable meaning may be conceived, they shall not be defeated but shall ſtand good: And ſo he ſaid in our caſe, that it is neceſſarily intended that this was alſo to begin after the Eſtate of <hi>Markham</hi> determined, and for that good: And he ſaid that a man ought not to make a curious and captious interpretation of the Kings Patents, for <hi>Talis Interpretatio injure Reprobatur:</hi> And to the <note place="margin">Challenge.</note> challenge, that ſeemed unto him a principall challenge, and this not being allowed, where it ought to be allowed, this is an error, as it is ſaid 8. <hi>of Aſſiſes</hi> 23. and for this error it ſeemes to him that the Judgement shall be reverſed, and to that he ſaid he relied much upon the book of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 25. which takes a difference between Debt and Treſpaſſe for battery, for the booke ſaith that a man may demand his Debt, without giving occaſion of any malice: But Battery is an evill Action, and there the book is reſolved, that it ſhall be a principall challenge, and ſo he ſaith in Treſpaſſe, this being with force and Armes, that, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in 8. <hi>H.</hi> 5. in a Aſſiſe, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant challenges the array, becauſe he had an Action of Treſpaſſe hanging againſt the Sheriff: And there the array was affirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it appeares that the Defendant had brought this Action by Covin againſt the Sheriff, which caſe proves, as he ſaid, that if there be not any Covin this is a principall challenge, and 38 H. 6. 7. accordingly, and the caſe 28. <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> 11. where the Defendant in Aſſiſe challenged a Juror, becauſe he had an Action of Treſpaſſe hanging againſt him, and was outed by award, and in 21. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 12. it is ſaid where there is an apparent favour, or apparent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, there ſhall be principall challenge, and certainly though
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:41383:252"/>
the Law may intend, that a man may lawfully demand his right, and without malice, yet it appeares that the nature of men is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and froward, and few Actions are begun without apparent diſpleaſure, eſpecially Actions of Treſpaſſe, <hi>Pedibus Ambulando,</hi> and vexation plainly appeares, when Actions are begun upon ſuch ſlight occaſions, and in Actions of Treſpaſſe there iſſueth a <hi>Capias</hi> for a Fine, and ſo the Defendant ſhall be Fined and Impriſoned, and ſure to be deprived of his liberty is a thing diſtaſtefull.</p>
                     <p>And it cannot be but that diſpleaſure shall be between them, which endeavour to reſtraine one the other of their liberty; and ſo he concluded that this was a principall challenge, and not being allowed this is error, and ſo for this cauſe he reverſed the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Alſo it ſeemed to him as this caſe is, there is no ſeiſin found of the Paunage, for the Jury have found that the Earle of <hi>Rutland</hi> hath put in two Horſes, and it ſeemes to him that Horſes cannot take ſeiſin of Paunage, which is properly meate for Hoggs, and ſo for this reaſon alſo, inſomuch that there is no ſeiſin found of the Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, and the Jury ought to find of neceſſity a Seiſin and Deſsei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, it ſeemes to him that this is error, and ſo the Judgement ought to be reverſed, and at the ſame day <hi>Williams</hi> Juſtice rehearſed the caſe as before, and in his argument he ſpake.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to Grants. Secondly to the challenge.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly to the abatement of the Writ; And it ſeemes to him, that none of theſe matters were ſufficient to reverſe the Judgement, but yet he conceived for two other cauſes that the Judgement ſhall be reverſed.</p>
                     <p>And firſt concerning <hi>Markhams</hi> Patent, that the Jury have found very good, though that they have not ſaid by the ſame <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> but he ſaid that it had been more proper if they had found that the King had granted that by the ſame <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> and for that he cited the caſe of Information of Mines in the <hi>Com.</hi> And the pleadings before the caſe, there the <hi>Letters Patents</hi> of the King are pleaded, and where the King grants divers things, it is there ſaid, that the King by the ſame <hi>Letters Patents</hi> granted, and ſo the caſe of <hi>Grendon</hi> againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> where the King by his <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> granted to a Deane and Chapter that they ſhould hold an Advowſon to their proper uſe, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther granted by the ſame <hi>Letters Patents, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo he ſaid in this caſe that this had been more properly found; if it had been found that the King <hi>(Per Eaſdem Litteras Patentes)</hi> granted, yet this is very good as it is, and this as he ſaid by the Intendment, for it cannot be otherwiſe intended, and for that he cited the book of Entries in Title Covenant: That where a man brings a Writ of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and counts upon an Indenture, that is, that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:41383:253"/>
covenanted to do ſuch a thing, and further covenanted, and doth not ſay by the ſame Indenture, yet this is very good becauſe it cannot be otherwiſe intended, but when that is by the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denture, and where things ſhall be taken by Intendment, he cited the caſe of 5. <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 2. Where in Aſſiſe of Common, the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff made him Title, that is, that he was ſeiſed after the Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of King <hi>H.</hi> this ſhall be intended <hi>H.</hi> 3. See <hi>Brooke</hi> Limitation 4. and the Caſe of 17. <hi>Eliz Dyer</hi> 342, Where theſe Letters <hi>H. R. A. F.</hi> ſhall be intended <hi>Henricus Rex Angliae Franciae.</hi> &amp;c. And he cited the caſe of 21. <hi>H.</hi> 7. 32. Where a man pleads a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe made in <hi>Villa de Weſt.</hi> the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and doth not ſay ſecondarily, <hi>In Predicta Villa:</hi> And there theſe Juſtices held that good, and it shall be intended the ſame Town, ſo he ſaid in this caſe, this shall be intended that Grant by the ſame <hi>Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> (though that <hi>(Eaſdem)</hi> be left out: And to the Grant to the Earle of <hi>Rutland,</hi> he held that good, alſo though that it is not expreſſed as concerning the Herbage and Paunage when that <note place="margin">Earl of Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands Patent.</note> should begin, and he ſaid that this is alſo for the intent, and alſo he ſaid that this is not in prejudice of the King, nor in deceit of the King, nor to the double Intendment, and for that good: And he put the caſe where the King made a Leaſe for one and twenty years rendring Rent, and doth not shew when that shall begin: That shall begin from the Date of the <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> becauſe it cannot be otherwiſe intended, ſo in the principall caſe the grant of the Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage and Paunage depends upon another Grant: That is, the cuſtody of the Parke which was to begin after death, ſurrender, or, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of <hi>Markham,</hi> and having relation to that by this word <hi>(<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius)</hi> that shall be neceſſarily intended to begin at the ſame time, and he well agreed the bookes of 3. <hi>H. 7. fol.</hi> the laſt, and 6. <hi>H. 7. 14. 8. H. 7. 1. 9. Eliz. 259. 7. Ed. 6. Dyer</hi> 80. That there is no reverſion of an office: But yet the King may grant an office after the firſt Grant determined, and this shall be good: And ſo shall be in our caſe of the Herbage and Paunage, and he cited the caſe of 8 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12. 13. where the King was Founder of an Abbey, and he had granted a Corody to another for life, and after he releaſed that, and granted it to the Abbot, this shal not be a good releaſe preſently, becauſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath the poſſeſſion for preſent of it, but this shall be good after the death of him which hath this granted for his life: And he cited the caſe of the Lord <hi>Chaundois 6. Coke,</hi> where the King grants the Mannor of Dale in tayl, and after grants the Mannor to another, this shall paſſe the reverſion, for this is all that the King can paſſe: So he ſaid in this caſe, this shall paſse in ſuch manner as it may paſse, by which he concluded the Grant to the Earle of <hi>Rutland</hi> good: Alſo to the challenge, it ſeemed to him it is no principall challenge, <note place="margin">Challenge.</note>
                        <pb n="235" facs="tcp:41383:253"/>
and for authority he cited the caſe in 11. <hi>H.</hi> 4. That hath been ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the other part, which was for him as he ſaid, for this takes the difference between Debt and Battery, <hi>and</hi> 38. H. 6. <hi>a.</hi> Juror was challenged becauſe one of the parties had an Action of Treſpaſse hanging againſt him, and this was not any principall challenge, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſse it be Treſpaſse of Battery, and to the booke of 20. <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 11. Where a Juror was challenged, becauſe he had Treſpaſse againſt him before the <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> he ſaid it did not appeare by the book, what Treſpaſſe that was: So it ſhall be intended Battery, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with this difference, that if ſuch an Action be hanging which tends to the utter undoing of him, againſt whom it is brought, then if the Defendant in ſuch Action make the array, this ſhall be a principal challenge, but if it be but ſuch an Action in which a man shal recover but his Debt or Damages or ſuch lawfull duties; there to ſay that ſuch Action is hanging between them, at the time of the array made ſhall be no principall challenge: And for that he cited the book of 24, <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Where a <hi>Tales</hi> was returned by the Sheriff of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and the party challenged the Jury, becauſe he ſued the Sheriff for the death of his Servant, and this was a principall challenge, for in ſuch caſe his life was in queſtion; the ſame Law in caſe of Maintenance and Champerty, for the Law hath inflicted great puniſhment upon ſuch Offences, ſo theſe matters tend to utter ſubverſion of his Eſtate and life, but otherwiſe in Actions of Treſpaſſe, and ſo he concluded no principall challenge: To the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Abatement.</note> of the Writ it ſeemes no Error.</p>
                     <p>Firſt he conceived that there is no entry, and for the reaſon that <hi>Crooke</hi> had given before, that is, becauſe he entred to hunt, and not to keep poſſeſſion, and hath not shewed any Warrant to kill the Buck, and he cited the book of the 5. <hi>of Ed. 4. fol.</hi> 60. Where <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bington</hi> brought an <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> of the houſe of the <hi>Fleete,</hi> and hanging the <hi>Aſſiſe, Babington</hi> came to the Jury within the houſe (when they had the View) with his Councell to shew Evidence for the view, and this was not any entry to abate the Writ, and ſo the entry to hunt is an entry for another purpoſe then an entry to keep poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (not being by warrant as it is not found) and for that no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to abate the Writ: But admitting that this had been an entry to abate the Writ, yet being a thing which doth not abate the Writ without Plea, and that cannot be pleaded as the caſe is, he conceived was no Error, but if it had been a thing which abated the Writ <hi>in Facto</hi> without Plea, then to give Judgement upon a Writ abated is Error: As if the party die hanging the Writ, or if a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſole brings an <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> and takes a Husband hanging the <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Errour?</note> or if the Plaintiff in a <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> be made Judge of <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> as the 15. <hi>of Aſſiſe,</hi> in all theſe caſes the Writ is abated <hi>in Facto</hi> without Plea:
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:41383:254"/>
But entry shall not abate the Writ without Plea, and ſo it ſeemes to him no error: But he conceived that there were two other errors, for which he reverſed the Judgement.</p>
                     <p>The firſt was, that this <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> was <hi>de Libero Tenemento in Clepſon,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Variance.</note> and the plaint was of the keeping of the Park of <hi>Clepſom</hi> and of the Herbage and Paunage of the Parke aforeſaid called <hi>Clepſom,</hi> and made his Title for Herbage and Paunage of the Park of <hi>Clepſom,</hi> and ſo he conceived that there is variance between the Plaint and the Title and Park of <hi>Clepſom,</hi> and <hi>Clepſom</hi> cannot be intended one, without ſpeciall averment, and for that he conceived it to be errour. And to that he cited the caſe of twelve <hi>Aſſiſes</hi> two. Where in attaint the firſt originall was of the Mannor of <hi>Auſty,</hi> and the Attaint was of the Mannor of <hi>Aueſty,</hi> and yet for that that the Attaint is founded upon the Record, and not upon the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and the Record was of the Mannor of <hi>Aueſty,</hi> this was very good, but the Booke ſaith, that this variance between the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and the Record, was ſufficient to reverſe the Record for errour, and the caſe in 42 of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Where <hi>Scire facias</hi> was brought of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements in <hi>Eaſtgrave,</hi> and the Fine was of Tenements in <hi>Deepgrave,</hi> and for the variance the Writ abated; and in the caſe of 5 <hi>Coke 46. Formedon</hi> was brought of the Mannor of <hi>Isfeild;</hi> and the Tenant pleads in barr a recovery of the Mannor of <hi>Iffeild,</hi> and this ſhall not be amended unleſſe it appear that this is a miſpriſion of the Clark or by other averment, he cited alſo the caſe of 3 <hi>H. 4. 8. Scire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> upon garniſhment in a Writ of <hi>Detinue</hi> of writings, the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall name <hi>John Scripſtead,</hi> and the <hi>Scire facias</hi> was made <hi>Iohn Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> and therefore agreed that he ſhall ſue a new <hi>Scire facias,</hi> ſo he ſaid in the Principal caſe the Plaint being of Herbage and Paunage of <hi>Clepſon</hi> Parke, aad the title being at <hi>Clepſom</hi> Parke, theſe ſhall not be intended to be the ſame Parke without averment, and there in no averment in our caſe, and for that ſuch variance is ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that ſhall reverſe the Judgment.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond errour for which he reverſed the Judgment was that which was moved by Juſtice <hi>Crook</hi> that the Jury have not found any ſeiſin of the Paunage, for it ſeemed to him that a Horſe could <note place="margin">Seiſin.</note> not take Seiſin of paunage, and for that he defined paunage, and he ſayd that <hi>Linwood</hi> title-Tithes ſaith, the <hi>Paunagium eſt paſtus Porcorum,</hi> as of Nuts and Akornes of trees in the wood, and <hi>Crompton</hi> ſaith, that this is, <hi>Paſtus Porcorum,</hi> and he ſaith that <hi>Paunagium</hi> is either uſed for Paunage, or the Paunage it ſelf, and the Statute of <hi>Charta de Foreſta,</hi> ſaith; that every Freeman may drive his Hoggs, into our royall Wood, and ſhall have there Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, but he doth not ſay Horſes or other Beaſts, but he conceived that if the Earle of <hi>Rutland</hi> had right in the Park, that this had been
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:41383:254"/>
ſufficient ſeiſin of Herbage and Paunage alſo, for Hoggs will feed upon graſs as well as upon Akornes, and he cited the Book of 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. ſaith that Seiſin to maintain an <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> ought not to be of a contrary nature to the thing of which ſeiſin is intended to be given, but in one caſe only, and that is where the Sheriff gives ſeiſin of a Rent by a Twig or by a Clod of Earth, and this is in caſe of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for the Sheriff cannot take the Money out of the purſe of the Tenant of the Land, and deliver ſeiſin of that, and for that he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the caſe in 45 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Where Commoner comes to the Land where he ought to have Common, and enters into the Land, and the Lord of the Waſte or the Grantor of the Common outs him, he cannot have an <hi>Asſiſe</hi> of his Common upon this outing, for this was not any ſeiſin of the Common: ſo it is in this caſe, the Horſes cannot take Seiſin of the Paunage, and ſo there is no ſeiſin or diſſeiſin found by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and then no <hi>Asſiſe,</hi> and this being after Judgment no abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be of the Plaint, and ſo for theſe laſt reaſons he reverſed the Judgment.</p>
                     <p>And at another day the caſe was rehearſed again and argued by <note place="margin">Abridgment of the Plaint in Aſſiſe. Yelverton. Fenner.</note> 
                        <hi>Yelverton and Fenner</hi> Juſtices, but I did not hear their Arguments, inſomuch that they ſpake ſo low; but their opinions were decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the cheife Juſtice, and <hi>Yelverton</hi> affirmed the Judgment in all.</p>
                     <p>Firſt he held that this entry ſhall not abate the writ.</p>
                     <p>Secondly admit that it is abated, yet being between Verdict and Judgment ſhall not be aſſigned for errour.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he held that no principall challenge. <note place="margin">Challenge prin.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, he held both the grants good.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, that <hi>Clepſam and Clipſam</hi> are all one, and not ſuch vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that ſhall make Errour.</p>
                     <p>And laſtly, that a Horſe may well take Seiſin of Paunage, and <hi>Fenner</hi> agreed in all, but he held that this was a principall challenge, and not being allowed this was Error, and for this cauſe and another exception to the Record, which was not much materiall, he rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Judgment.</p>
                     <p>And at another day <hi>Flemming</hi> cheife Juſtice rehearſed the caſe, and this argued; and to the firſt matter he conceived.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That it is no ſuch entry that abates the Writ. <note place="margin">Flemming.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, Admitting that it were yet this cannot be aſſigned for Errour.</p>
                     <p>And to the firſt matter he took this ground, That every entry which may abate a writ ought to be in the thing demanded, and for that he ſayd, if a man brings an <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> of Rent or common, and hanging this <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> he enters into the Land, this is not any En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which will abate the Writ, and he ſayd that the Park, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:41383:255"/>
the keeping of the Park are two diſtinct things, and for that the entry into one, that is, the Park will not abate the Writ for the keeping of that, and to that which is ſayd that he took a Fee, that is, a ſhoulder of a Buck, that doth not make any matter, for two reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, he hath not ſhewed a Warrant he had to kill the Buck.</p>
                     <p>Secondly the taking of the fee is no entring into the Office, but the excerciſing of that, but admit that this were an entry, or the thing it ſelf, yet he ſayd every entry into the thing ſhall not abate the Writ, and to that he ſayd, that if this entry of the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> to hunt was no ſuch entry that ſhall abate the Writ, for his office was not to hunt, and for that his entry being to another purpoſe, it ſhall not be ſayd an entry to abate the Writ; and for that he cited a caſe, which hath been cited, as he ſayd, by Juſtice <hi>Yelverton,</hi> that if a man have Common in the Land of <hi>J. S.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Annunciation of our Lady, and <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner brought an <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> of his Common, and at <hi>Christmas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> put in his Beaſts and this ſhall not be any entry to abate his Writ, for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be intended for the ſame Common, which caſe is agreed to be good Law, and he cited the caſe put by <hi>Brooke in Aſſiſe of Freſhforce</hi> before remembred <hi>Com.</hi> 93. Where hanging a Formedon, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant pleads in abatement of the Writ, that the Demandant hath entred after the laſt continuance, and upon the evidence it appears, that many were cutting wood upon the Land, and the Demandant comes into the Land to them, and warnes them upon the perill that might enſue to them, that they ſhould do no more then they could do by Law, and this was found no entry: Alſo the caſe of 26. <hi>Asſiſe</hi> before cited by Juſtice <hi>Crooke,</hi> and he ſayd that the Statute of <hi>Charta de Foresta, chapter</hi> 11. willeth, that every Arch-Biſhop. Biſhop, Earl, or Baron, comming to the King by his command, and paſſing by his Forreſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Was licenſed to take one Beaſt or two by the ſight of the Keeper; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Put caſe then, that the King had ſent for the Earl of <hi>Rutland,</hi> and he had paſſed through this Park, and had killed a Buck, had this beene an entry to abate this writ, <hi>Quaſi diceret non,</hi> for this was entry to another purpoſe, ſo he ſayd in the principall caſe the entry to hunt, and ſo no entry to abate the Writ, but admitting that this had been an entry, which would abate the writ, then let us ſee if this entry hath ſo abated the writ, being Meſne between the Verdict and the Judgment, it cannot be aſſigned for errour, and to that he agreed the diverſity before taken <note place="margin">What matter ſhall be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Error after Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> by <hi>Crooke</hi> and <hi>Williams,</hi> where the writ is abated by Plea and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out plea, and he cited a Judgment in the Kings Bench, between <hi>Jackson and Parker 2 Eliz.</hi> where in <hi>Ejectione firme</hi> the Plaintiff en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Meſne between Verdict and Judgment, and this was aſſigned
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:41383:255"/>
for Errour in the Exchequer Chamber, and the Judgment notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding affirmed, and he ſayd that if <hi>Memorandum</hi> had been <note place="margin">Variante.</note> made of it, or if a Jury had found it, and it had been prayed that that might be Recorded, yet this had not been materiall, and that that be not aſſigned for Errour. And to the matter moved by my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Williams,</hi> that there ſhould be a variance between the plaint and the Title, he conceived that there is no ſuch variance, that ſhall make the Judgment errronious, and to that he examined the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>Firſt that the <hi>Asſiſe</hi> was of a Free-hold in <hi>Clepſom,</hi> and his title is made of the parke of <hi>Clipſon,</hi> that that cannot be otherwiſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but that of neceſſity it ought to be the ſame park.</p>
                     <p>For firſt there is but one park by all the Record.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the plaint ſaith, <hi>De parco predicto,</hi> which hath reference <hi>to Clepſom</hi> park, and there is but one park put in view by all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It ſhall be ſo taken according to the common ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, when he hath made his plaint of the cuſtody of the park of <hi>Clepſom,</hi> and of the Herbage and paunage of the park aforeſaid cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Clepſom,</hi> theſe words (called <hi>Clepſom)</hi> are but Idle and Trifles, and that which is but Surpluſage ſhall not annoy. Alſo he ſaid that <hi>J. and E.</hi> are letters which do not much differ in pronunciation, and they are all one as <hi>I</hi> and <hi>he</hi> ſhall be pronounced as <hi>hi;</hi> and he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Book of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 26. Where in Debt, variance was taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the writ and the Obligation, <hi>that is, Quatuordecem pro Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuordecim,</hi> and this variance was not materiall, but that the writ was awarded good, and ſo he conceived that in this caſe the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Clepſom and Clipſom</hi> ſhall not be ſuch a materiall variance, that ſhall make the Judgment erronious, and to the title.</p>
                     <p>Firſt to <hi>Markhams</hi> grant, that is, where the Jury have found, <hi>Quod ulterius conceſſit,</hi> &amp;c. And doth not ſay, <hi>Per eaſdem,</hi> he held that good without ſcruple, and this for the neceſſary relation, that this had to any thing before granted, for he ſayd that this ſhould be a ſtrange and marvelous patent which begun in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that is, <hi>Et ulterius Rex concedit,</hi> &amp;c. And there was not any thing granted before. And for that he cited the caſe of 11 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 2. where Debt was brought upon an Indenture againſt the Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the Indenture was between the Abbot of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtry</hi> of the bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and rehearſed divers Covenants, for performance of which Covenants, the Abbot of <hi>Westminster</hi> bound himſelf in twenty pound, and doth not ſay that the aforeſayd Abbot, and yet good, for it ſhall be intended the ſame Abbot, for he is party to the Deed, and the caſe of 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12.
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:41383:256"/>
Where in <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> of Common the plaintiff makes his plaint of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon appurtenant to his Free-hold in <hi>D.</hi> and ſhews for Title, that he was ſeiſed of a Meſſuage, and of a Carve of Land in <hi>D.</hi> to which the Common is appurtenant, and that he and his Anceſtors, and all thoſe whoſe Eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have uſed Common of paſture with ten Beaſts, and exception taken to the title, becauſe he ſaith that he was ſeiſed, and not ſaith, that he is, and yet good by this word <hi>(Fuit)</hi> for that ſhall be intended that he continues ſeiſed, ſo he ſayd that things which are neceſſarily to be intended, though they be not ſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly expreſſed, yet ſhall be good by Implication, and ſo he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that this is no Error, for which the Judgment shall be reverſed. And to the challenge, he conceived that this is not any principall <note place="margin">Challenge.</note> challenge, and to that he put this difference, that if a man brings an <hi>Asſiſe</hi> of certain Land, and hath an Action of Treſpaſs hanging againſt the Sheriff for entring into the ſame Land, there ſhall be a principall challenge to the Array, but if it be for entry into other Land not in demand, otherwiſe it is, and what is principall chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and what not, he cyted the Bookes of 3 <hi>Ed. 4. 12. 6 Ed. 4. 1. 21 Ed. 4. 67. 14 H. 7. 1. 21. Ed.</hi> 4. 10. And to the point in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, he cyted the Bookes before remembred by <hi>Crooke and Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> and no others, and for that I omit to recite them, and he agreed alſo that in actions which concern life, Honeſty, Mayme, Battery, to ſay that he hath ſuch action hanging againſt the Sheriff, ſhall be a principall challenge, but Treſpaſs for entring into Land not, for in Treſpaſs there is no Land to be recovered, alſo no damages but to the value of the Treſpaſs.</p>
                     <p>And in Debt a man ſhall recover more then in Treſpaſſe: And yet it is agreed that this is no principall Challenge to ſay, that he hath an Action of Debt hanging againſt the Sheriff, as the Book of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. is, which hath been remembred, and for this I conceive it no <note place="margin">Seiſin.</note> principall challenge: And to the ſeiſin of the Paunages, if a Horſe may take ſeiſin of that, it ſeemes that yea, for I conceive that the taking of ſeiſin doth not conſiſt in the eating or not eating of that, of which the ſeiſin is to be taken, and for that he cited, that if a man grant to me the Herbage and Paunage of his Parke, and I come into the Parke and take the Graſſe and Herbs into my hands, or if I gather Akornes, this is ſufficient ſeiſin for me to have <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> though that I do not eate the Graſſe, nor the Akornes, and for that, let us put the caſe that a man hath Herbage granted to him, and he puts in his Beaſts, and before that they eate the graſſe, they are driven out, none will deny, but that, that ſhall be good ſeiſin, for ſo is the Book of the 22. <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> 84. Where a man hath Common granted to him, and he takes the Beaſts of a ſtranger: and puts them in, and them forthwith drive out, that ſhall be a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:41383:256"/>
good ſeiſin of the Common to have <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> ſo that he ſaid, that the eating is not to purpoſe, alſo he ſaid Horſes will eate Akornes, as well as Cowes: And he ſaith that in the Country where he inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits being a Wood-land Country, they will not ſuffer the Beaſts to go into the Woods at a certaine time of the yeare, and this is when Crabs are ripe, for then their Beaſts will eate Crabs, and ſet their teethes an edge, and then not being able to chew Akornes do ſwallow them whole, and then thoſe Ackornes being ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whole, will grow in the Mawe of the Beaſt, and ſo kill them: And he ſaith that though that Horſes be not ſo proper Beaſts, to take ſeiſin of Paunage as Porkes are, yet being put in for the ſame purpoſe, if they are diſturbed that shall be Seiſin and Diſſeiſin, and it ſeemes to him that when things are granted to one, that it ſhall not be ſtrange to ſay, that ſeiſin of one ſhall be ſeiſin of both, and for that if a man grants all his arrable Land, all his Meadow, and all his Wood, Livery and Seiſin in one ſuffices for all, but I conceive that this is in reſpect of the ſoyle which paſſeth, and ſo are all of one ſelf ſame nature, and ſo he conceives that this is ſufficient Sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin and Diſſeiſin found to have <hi>Aſſiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And laſtly to the Title of the Earle of <hi>Rutland,</hi> he ſaid that this was good, and to the Grants of the King he ſaid two things are neceſſary in all Grants of the King, that is, a Recitall, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, and when a recitall shall be neceſſary and when not, and he ſaid that in all caſes, when a common perſon makes a Leaſe for years or for life, and the reverſion is conveied to the King, if the King will make Eſtate to another, he shall not recite this Leaſe, for this not being of Record, the King cannot take notice of it, and ſo he shall not recite: But in all caſes when the King makes a Leaſe for life, or for years, and after will make a Grant to another, he ought to recite the firſt Eſtate, becauſe that is of Record: And Juſtice <hi>Yelverton</hi> as I heard of thoſe which were next unto him, put this caſe: That if the King grants a Leaſe for yeares rendring Rent, and after the King reciting the Leaſe grants that to another for years, or grants the reverſion to another, and doth not recite the Rent which was reſerved upon the firſt Leaſe, that this ſecond Grant ſhall be void for the not recitall: And the cheife Juſtice ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one <hi>Phillpotts</hi> Caſe to be adjudged in the 2. <hi>of Eliz.</hi> That where the King made a Leaſe for one and twenty yeares, and after reciting the ſaid Leaſe, grants the reverſion to another, and before that the ſecond <hi>Letters Patents</hi> were ſealed, the firſt Leſſee ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred: And ſaid that the ſecond Grant was adjudged void, for the King intended to paſſe a reverſion, and now he ſhall have a Poſſeſſion, and all that which is ſaid to be in caſe of Land: Now let us ſee how it ſhall be in caſe of office, and for that if a common

                     <p>Secondly if the office be recited in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> and be not in <hi>Eſſe,</hi> the Grant is void, as <hi>Blanyes</hi> Caſe is in the Lord <hi>Dyer 3 Eliz.</hi> 197. 47. And this ſufficeth for recitalls: Then for certainty of the Kings Grant, it is ſaid in the 2. <hi>R.</hi> 3. it is ſaid that the Grants of the King ought to be made in certaine, and for that where the King there Grants to Sir <hi>John Spencer</hi> that he ſhall not be Sheriff, this was void, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of the place: But if the Grant had been of ſuch a County, or ſuch a County, the Grant ſhould be good: Alſo there ought to be certainty of Eſtates, as it is in 18. <hi>H.</hi> 8. Where the King gives Lands to one and his Heires Males, this is void for uncertainty of the Eſtate, then it is ſo averred in our caſe if there be not ſufficient recitall and certainty, and to the recitall that is good without queſtion, for ſhe recites that ſhe hath granted that to <hi>Markham</hi> for if<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, and <hi>Markham</hi> is yet alive, and ſo the recitall good: Then for the certainty he ſaid, that the rule is, that if the certainty be declared by expreſſe words, or if the King may reduce that to a certainty, the Grant of the King ſhall not be defeated, and for that he cited the caſe of Information of <hi>Mines Comment.</hi> But if the King grant to me all <hi>Mines</hi> in the Land of <hi>J. S.</hi> There I ſhall have all <hi>Mines</hi> Royall, for the Law ſaith, the King cannot have other <hi>Mynes</hi> in the Soil of a Subject but <hi>Mines</hi> Royall, and ſo there the Law ſupplies the Grant, ſo that they be <hi>Mines</hi> Royall, though not expreſſed in the Grant in certaine, ſo he ſaid in the principall caſe, that the Queen hath expreſly recited, that ſhe hath granted the Herbage and Paunage for life to <hi>Markham,</hi> and that <hi>Markham</hi> was yet alive, and after grants that to the Earle of <hi>Rutland,</hi> and doth not ſay when that ſhall begin; the Law ſaith that ſhall begin after the death of <hi>Markham,</hi> for before that it cannot begin: But if the Queen had expreſt in the <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> that this shall begin forthwith, then this had been void, as the Lord <hi>Gaudy</hi> ſaid in <hi>Altonwoods</hi> Caſe, 1 <hi>Coke fol.</hi> 51. And ſo he concluded the Title of the Earle of <hi>Rutland</hi> good: So he affirmed the Judgement in all: But <hi>Williams</hi> was very peremtory for the conceit of Paunage that it was not good Seiſin: But after <hi>Crooke</hi> Juſtice recanted his opinion of that, and inſomuch that there were three which conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the reverſing of the Judgement: And yet for every point there were three againſt two: It was doubted if this Judgement ſhould be reverſed or not: And they ſaid that they would adviſe

with the reſt of the Judges, and after that it was moved againe by Serjeant <hi>Nicholls</hi> in the next Trinity Tearme, and <hi>Yelverton</hi> and the cheife Juſtices would have the Judgement affirmed, but <hi>Williams, Fenner, and Crooke,</hi> to be reverſed, and note well this Preſident, where Judgement was reverſed, and yet for every point there were three <hi>Contra</hi> two, or foure <hi>Contra</hi> one, ſee the firſt Judgement in the Common Bench <hi>Michaelmaſſe 6.

                     <p>THE Caſe was this; King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight Incorporated the <note place="margin">Miſnaming of a Corporation.</note> Schollers of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge</hi> by the name of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, Fellowes, and Schollers: <hi>Collegij Sanctae et Individuae Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis,</hi> in the Town and Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and in the 6. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. They made a Leaſe by the name of Maſter, and Fellowes of <hi>Trinity Colledge in Cambridge,</hi> leaving out the Univerſity: And if this Leaſe were good or not was the queſtion; And <hi>Yelverton</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued that this was not a good Leaſe, and that for the miſnaming of the Corporation: And to that he ſaid, to every Corporation, two things were incident: That is, name and place: and if any of thoſe fayl and be not certainly recited in a Leaſe, the Leaſe ſhall not be good: And he conceived that this Corporation is founded upon two places, and that one of them: That is, the Univerſity is left out, and for that cauſe the Leaſe is nothing worth, for if a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration hath two names, one of them cannot be omitted, as it is in the firſt of <hi>Mary Dyer</hi> 96, 97. and 4. <hi>Mary</hi> 140. and 150. 11. <hi>Eliz. Dyer 278. 35. H.</hi> 6. 5. and 6. No more then when it conſiſts of two places one of them may be left out: And for that, if they had been incorporated by the name of Maſter and Fellowes of <hi>Trinity Colledge in Norfolke and Suffolke</hi> in a Leaſe, they could not leave out <hi>Norfolke</hi> or <hi>Suffolke,</hi> but both the places ought to be incer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And by him in the principall caſe, if the Leaſe had been made by the name of the Maſter and Fellowes of <hi>Trinity Colledge</hi> in the Town, and leave out the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> without queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this shall be void, ſo here this being impliedly omitted ſhall be as ſtrong, as if it had been by expreſſe words excluded, ſo in the making of every Corporation, the intent of the Founder is to be conſidered, and for that it ſeemes the intent of the King in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that in both places, was firſt to erect a Colledge, and that to grace the Town, and then he hath placed them in the Univerſity, and this was for the inſtruction in good Arts and Learning, and ſo for theſe benefits they have of both theſe places, nor one nor the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:41383:258"/>
other may be left out: And if the King had been incorporated by the name of Maſter and Fellowes of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> and in the Market place of <hi>Cambridge:</hi> There though that the Market place was parcell of the Town of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> yet it ſeemes to him that this cannot be left out, for peradventure the Founder hath a ſpeciall reaſon to place that there, that is, to have all things neceſſary for them more neer unto them: Alſo where any ſtranger demands any poſſeſſion of them in <hi>Precipe Quod Reddat,</hi> or ſuch like, he ought to enſue them certainly and preciſely: Then a <hi>Fortiore</hi> where they depart with their poſſeſſions by their own Act, there they shall not be unknowing of their one names: And <hi>Walter</hi> of the inner Temple argued to the contrary, and he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">Walter</note> that the Leaſe is good, and firſt he argued the ground which hath been taken of the other part, that is, that every corporation ought to be in a certain place, and he conceived that there is a certaine place in this place, that is, the Town of <hi>Cambridge:</hi> And to that, that is ſaid that this Corporation is founded upon two places, he denied that all together, for no more then one mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Body, may be but in one place <hi>Simul and Semel,</hi> no more may it be in a Body Corporate, which hath allwaies his reſemblance to a Body naturall, and for that he denied the caſe, which hath been put of the other part, of <hi>Norfolk and Suffolk:</hi> And he cyted the opinion of the Lord <hi>Popham in Buttons</hi> Caſe, in which the Lord <hi>North</hi> was Intereſted, that a Corporation cannot be limited to a County, as <hi>Probos Homines</hi> of ſuch a County, or <hi>Trinity</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in ſuch a County, but it ought to be reſtrained to ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place, or one County, or a Town: But admit that the Corporation may be founded upon two places, yet he faith that a Univerſity is not Locall, but Perſonall: And to this purpoſe he cyted two Records one, in 48 <hi>H.</hi> 3. Which was this: King <hi>H.</hi> 3. Intending to keep a Parliament at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and knowing that the place was not ſufficient to contain all thoſe, which ſhould be there aſſembled, and the Schollers together, ſent his Writ which was directed to the Chancellor and Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> commanding them that they ſhould remove the Univerſity to ſuch a place, till the Parliament ſhould be ended: And after he ſent his Writ to them againe, which was directed to the Chancellor and Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by which he wild that they ſhould returne againe, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being ended, by which Writ he conceived that it appeares that the Univerſity was not Locall: And this for two reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Firſt inſomuch that this Writ was directed to the Chancellor and Univerſity, and every Writ is directed to a perſon and not to a place.</p>
                     <p>Secondly the Writ that he should move and remove the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:41383:258"/>
which is a thing impoſſible to do if it should be a place: The other Record was 49. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. And this declares, that there was contention between the Schollers of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and the Townes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men there, and the Schollers went to <hi>Northampton,</hi> and there they made a Petition to the King, that they might erect a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and the King ſent his Writ to the Maior, commanding him that he would not ſuffer the Schollers to remaine there, and that he would there erect a Univerſity, which proves that a Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity may be erected at the Kings pleaſure, and ſo cannot a place, then admitting that a Corporation may conſiſt upon a place, yet the Univerſity not being a place, that shall not be any prejudice to omit it: And he cited a caſe which was adjudged as he ſaid, in the 26. <hi>of Eliz.</hi> which was thus; The Deane and Canons <hi>of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor</hi> made a Leaſe for years by the name of Deane and Canons of new <hi>Winſor:</hi> And this was adjudged no variance, and the caſe of 5. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 5. of the Abbot of Saint <hi>Maries in York</hi> which ſee there, and he ſaid the Lord <hi>Norths</hi> Caſe was thus: That Chriſt Church in <hi>Oxford</hi> was incorporate by the name of Deane and Canons of Chriſt Church in <hi>Oxford:</hi> And they made a Feoffment by the name of the Deane and Canons of Chriſt Church in the Univerſity of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and adjudged a good Feoffment: And he ſaid that in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of this caſe it was ſaid by <hi>Gaudy,</hi> that if a corporation were made of Dale, and after Dale is made into a City, they may make a Leaſe by the name of a City of <hi>Dale,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> (as he ſaid) put theſe caſes: That is, that if a Corporation be founded of <hi>Oxford:</hi> And that they made a Leaſe by the name of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the Precincts of <hi>Oxford,</hi> this ſhall be a good Leaſe, yet a thing may be within the Precincts of another place, and not in the place, and in the 32. <hi>Eliz.</hi> was the caſe of one <hi>Jermin and Wylles,</hi> that if a Corporation be made, by the name of Deane and Chapter of Saint <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Exceter</hi> is good: But they agreed in this caſe as he ſaid, that if it appeare that they cannot be intended allone, otherwiſe it ſhould be, and he conceived in the principall caſe, that it is not neceſſarily that it ſhould be intended the ſame place, and for that he conceived in all thoſe caſes that the Leaſe ſhall be good, and he ſaid that there were neer two hundred Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes upon the ſame Title, for which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And after this it was argued in <hi>Michaelmaſſe</hi> Tearme 1609. 7. <hi>Jacobi</hi> by the Juſtices: And the opinion of <hi>Crook and Williams</hi> Juſtices was, that the Leaſe was good: But <hi>Fenner and Yelverton</hi> to the contrary, and <hi>Flemming</hi> cheif Juſtice argued that the Leaſe was not good; but he ſaid this should not be abſolutely his opinion, but moved a compoſition betwixt the parties: But inſomuch that the matter was not compounded, in the ſame <hi>Michaelmaſſe</hi> Tearme,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:41383:259"/>
Judgement was praied: And <hi>Williams</hi> Juſtice brought into the Court a decree out of the Court of Wards concerning the Caſe which is put in 7. <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> and 1. <hi>Coke Porters</hi> Caſe: And upon the decree appeares, that an Information being exhibited there againſt the Maſter and fellows of <hi>Trinity Colledge in Cambridge</hi> concerning certain Land they made Title to, by a Deviſe made to them, by the name of Maſters, Fellows and Schollers, of <hi>Trinity Colledge in Cambridge,</hi> and this Deviſe was made, four and five of <hi>Phil. and Mary,</hi> and the Decree recyted, that upon this were two great Doubts and Queſtions conceived.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, If this Deviſe were good, and alſo by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 1. and 2. <hi>Phil. and Mary,</hi> which inabled to deviſe to ſpirituall Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                     <p>And the ſecond point was, That where they were incorporated by the name of Maſter, Fellows and Schollars <hi>De ſancta and Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua Trinitate,</hi> in the Univerſity and Town of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> if this deviſe made to them by the name of Maſter, Fellowes, and Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of <hi>Trinity Colledge in Cambridge</hi> was good, and the Decree rehearſed, that the opinion of all the Juſtices in <hi>England</hi> was.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That it was a good Deviſe within the <hi>Statute of one and two Phillip and Mary,</hi> as it is reported in the Booke before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, That this was not ſuch a miſ-naming of the Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which made the Deviſe voyd, and <hi>Williams</hi> Juſtice produced this Record, as he ſayd to fortify his opinion: And he conceived no difference between a Grant and a Deviſe, nor no difference when an Eſtate or conveyance made unto them, and conveiance made by them, and for that he cited the Caſe in the 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. in <hi>Dyer,</hi> where if a man deviſe Land to the Abbey of <hi>Saint Peters,</hi> where the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> this is a voyd deviſe, and ſo in a grant.

                     <p>Firſt a Will and a grant, for in caſe of a Will, it ſufficeth if they be deſcribed by a name, by which the Intent of the Deviſor may be ſufficiently known, and a man is intended to be <hi>Inops conſilij</hi> at the time of the Deviſe made, and for that that he hath not any to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:41383:259"/>
as ever he heard in his life, but yet he conceived alſo, that there is a great difference between a Grant and a Deviſe, as if a man deviſe to a Monke the Remainder over, this is a good remainder, ſo deviſe to one the Remainder over, and the particular Tenant refuſe, this is good in a Deviſe, contrary in grant, and to the caſe which is put by my Brother <hi>Williams</hi> out of the 19 <hi>H. 8. Dyer,</hi> there is a great difference, where there is not any ſuch perſon at all to take, there the Deviſe ſhall be void, as where the Deviſe to the Abbot of <hi>Saint Peter,</hi> where the foundation is of <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> and where it is a perſon certain, but all the name is not ſo preciſely recyted, and to that which is ſayd by my Brother <hi>Williams,</hi> that no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween conveiance made to them and by them, I agree to him with this difference, that is, if conveyance be made to them, of what by preſumption in Law they are knowing, and are parties as a Fine levied to them, and ſuch like, but of a Deviſe it is not preſumed, that they have knowledge of that till the Death of the Deviſor, and he conceived that the Leaſe is voyd, and this Decree ſhewed, hath not changed his opinion, but he moved the parties again to an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and would not as yet give Judgment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hitcham</hi> the Queens Attorney, moved the Court for a Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">Prohibition.</note> and the caſe was this, two Merchants covenanted by Deed with their Factor to allow him ten pound a Moneth for his Wages, and one Merchant ſealed the Deed in <hi>England</hi> and the other ſealed that upon the Sea, and the Factor came and ſued the Merchants in the Admiralty for his wages, and by the Court inſomuch that one of them ſealed it upon the Land, this is not any thing done upon the Deepe Sea, and for that Prohibition was granted to him.</p>

And to the firſt objection, that hath been made, that is, that reverſion was granted, and increaſe of an Eſtate cannot be of a reverſion, and in all theſe caſes which have been put they are of an Eſtate in poſſeſſion, and ſo is the caſe of <hi>Littleton</hi> alſo, and he agreed that it shall not be good, if it be not good, <hi>ab Initio,</hi> that though there be not other words then <hi>Reverſionem predictam:</hi> That it shall be good.</p>
                     <p>And to the ſecond point upon the former: He conceived that the Grant is but a Grant, and that the condition is but prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Limitation, when the Eſtate of Fee-ſimple shall begin, and ſo it is ſaid by <hi>Montague,</hi> in <hi>Colthurſt and Brinskins</hi> Caſe in the <hi>Com.</hi> And further he ſaith that there are four things neceſſary for increaſing an Eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that it ought to be an Eſtate, upon which the increaſing Eſtate may increaſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the particular Eſtate ought to continue, for otherwiſe it is grant of a reverſion in <hi>Futuro.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, That the Eſtate which is to increaſe ought to veſt by the performance of the Condition, for if there be diſturbance that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then veſt, then it can never veſt.</p>
                     <p>Foutthly, that both the Eſtates as well the particular Eſtate as the Eſtate which is to increaſe ought to have their beginning by one ſelf ſame Deed, or by diverſe Deeds delivered at one ſelf ſame time.</p>
                     <p>And to the firſt and to prove that he cyted 44 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Attaint 22. Leſſee for yeares upon condition to have Fee, granes his Eſtate, the Fee doth not increaſe upon the performance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for then it ſhall paſſe as a Reverſion, and ſo the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Tenant ſurrenders his Eſtate, as it is ſayd 14. <hi>H.</hi> 8. For if the Privity be deſtroyed the Fee will never increaſe, but there is no ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ycity, but that if the ſubſtance of the Eſtate remains, though it doth not remain in ſuch form, as it was at the firſt Reverſion, the Eſtate may well increaſe, as if Lands be given to the Husband and wife and to the Heirs of the Husband, upon the Body of the Wife to be begotten, the Wife dies, and the Husband is Tenant after poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Iſſue extinct, yet he may well perform the condition, for the Eſtate remaines in ſubſtance, and with this agrees, 20 <hi>H.</hi> 6. Ayd; and ſo it is if a Leaſe be made to two for years upon condition to have fee, one dies, the other may perform the Condition, and ſhall have Fee-ſimple, as it is agreed by 12. <hi>Asſiſe</hi> 5. the reaſon is that the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity remaines and the Eſtate alſo in ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, As to that alſo, it ſeems that it ought to veſt upon the performance of the condition, which is the time limited for the beginning of the Eſtate, and if it do not veſt then, it shall never veſt, and if it do not veſt without Office in this caſe, it ſhal never veſt

                     <p>And to the fourth it ſeems alſo, that both the Eſtates ought to be created and granted by one ſelf ſame Deed, or by divers delivered at one time, <hi>Quia quae in continenti fiunt pro uno habeantur &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putentur,</hi> as if a man makes a Leaſe for years upon Condition to have in tayl, upon condition to have in Fee, this ſecond condition is void, for it ought to be all one Crant, and cannot be intire, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the privity of the firſt grant, and it is not material though that the firſt Eſtate be drowned upon the performance of the condition, as if the King makes a Leaſe for life, the Remainder in tayl upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that if the Tenant for life pay twenty ſhillings, that he ſhall have Fee, this ſhall be a good Grant, and the Fee well veſted by the performance of the condition, though that the particular Eſtate for life ſhall not be drowned.</p>
                     <p>And to the ſecond point, that is, that the Grant of the King ſhall not be good, for that that it is by the words, Reverſion afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, he agreed that if the King makes a Grant to one intent, that ſhall not enure to another intent: But this ſhall enure to the intent for which it is made, <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t res magis vale et quam periat,</hi> and it is for the diſhonor of the King, to make an unconſcionable Grant. And to the Objection which is made, that the King is not underſtanding of Law, to that he anſwered, that the King is <hi>(Caput Legis)</hi> and for that ſhall not be intended to be ignorant of it, and for that if a grant may have two intendments, one to make the Grant good, the other to make the Grant voyd, it ſhall be intended, and expounded in the better ſenſe, that is, to make the Grant Good, and not to make the Grant voyd, for this was <hi>Iniquae expoſitio,</hi> and alſo he ſayd that the Grant ſhall be good for the firſt word <hi>(Concedo)</hi> though it had not been ſubſequent alſo, as if a man grant a Rent charge, and if it be behinde, that the Grantee may diſtrain for the firſt Grant, and the Grant is not of a Reverſion <hi>In futuro,</hi> but grant

that if the condition be performed that then the Fee doth paſs <hi>In fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turo,</hi> and it ſeemed to him, that it was a good deviſe to prevent that the Eſtate tayl ſhould not be diſcontinued by Fine nor other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, untill the Condition were performed, and ſo of recovery al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; for if the King grant an Eſtate tayl, and after grants the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in tayl, this ſecond intayl is within the intent of the Statute, and when the Iſſue of the firſt Tenant in tayl ſhall not be barred, the Eſtate of the Tenant in tayl in Remainder ſhall not be barred, ſee the Lord <hi>Barkleys caſe in the Com. fol</hi> and 7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. and as to the pleading he ſayd, that when the Iſſue is offered, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon matter in Law, there is no neceſſity to take travers upon the matter in Law, for it doth not belong to lay men to decide the matter in Law, and for that he concludes, that the Grant in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is good, and in form exqueſite, and that the Iſſue in tayl in Reverſion ſhall not be barred, for <hi>Quod non in principio valet, non valebit in acceſſario,</hi> and that Judgment ought to be for the Plaintiff, which was done accordingly.</p>

                     <p>Firſt, is the learned man which reades all Bookes extant, and his knowledge is ſpeculative, and by that he knew the nature of all ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                     <p>And the ſecond is practive, the knowledge of which is only his experience, he may give <hi>Probatum eſt:</hi> But the ignorance of the cauſe of the diſeaſe, and the nature of the things which he applies for the cure of that.</p>
                     <p>And the third is an Impoſter, which takes upon him the knowledg which he hath not, and every of them the Colledge may puniſh, for <hi>Male utenda, faciendo vel exequendo,</hi> by what way they will: And this was not the firſt care which was had, for in the 9. <hi>H.</hi> 5. was a private Act made for Phiſitians, by which there is great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to them which are learned and educated in the Univerſity: And for that the Act provides that they ſhall not be prejudicall to any of the Univerſities of <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and with this agrees 3. <hi>H.</hi> 8. 11. and the priviledges of them, and the <hi>Docti et graves homines,</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> are the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men mentioned in the Act, for the <hi>Statute</hi> provides that they ſhall puniſh according to theſe <hi>Statutes,</hi> and late edicts: And by the former Lawes the Univerſities, that their priviledges were excepted, and by their former <hi>Statutes,</hi> the <hi>Letters Patents</hi>
                        <pb n="259" facs="tcp:41383:265"/>
ought to be directed, for it is referred to them: Alſo the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi> of this Realme have alwaies had great reſpect to the Gradiats of the Univerſities, and it is not without cauſe, for <hi>Sudavit et Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit,</hi> and hath no other reward but this degree which is Doctor, and for that the <hi>Statute of 21, H.</hi> 8. prefers Graduates, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides that Doctors of Divinity or Batchelors shall be capable of two Benefices with Cure without diſpenſation: And ſo 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides that none shall be preſented to a Benefice above the value of thirty pound <hi>per annum,</hi> if he be not a Doctor or Bachelor of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: And to the objection, that none ſhall practiſe in <hi>London</hi> or ſeven miles circute of it without licence, that this clauſe ſhall be expounded according to the matter, and to that he agreed, for the other branches of the <hi>Statute</hi> are made to cheriſh grave and learned men, and for that it ſhall not be intended, that this branch was made for the puniſhment of thoſe, but of others which the <hi>Statute</hi> intended to punish.</p>
                     <p>And to the ſecond objection, that every Doctor is not the learned and grave man intended within the <hi>Statute,</hi> for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of many of them is only ſpeculative without practiſe, to that he anſwered, that all their Study is practiſe, and that if they have no practiſe of themſelves, then they attend upon others which practiſe, and apply themſelves to know the nature of Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
                     <p>And to third objection, that in <hi>London</hi> ought to be choyce men, for the Statute appoints that they shall be examined by the Bishop and Deane and four others at leaſt, and for that there is a more ſtrict courſe for them, then in other places, to that it is agreed: But he ſaid that in the Univerſity there is a more ſtrict courſe then this, for here he ought to be publickly approved by many after that he hath been examined and anſwered in the Schooles, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe queſtions, and allowed by the Congregation houſe: And 35. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 55.

And when a man brings with him the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne of Doctrine, there is no reaſon that he should be examined againe, for then if they will not allow of him, he shall not be allowed, though he be a learned and grave man, and it was not the intent of the King to make a <hi>Monopoly</hi> of this practiſe.</p>
                     <p>And to the ſecond point that he propounded, it ſeemes that

the Juſtification is not good, which is, <hi>Quia non comperuit,</hi> upon Summons, he was amerced, and ordered that he ſhall be arreſted, and being arreſted, being examined if he would ſubmit himſelf to the Colledge, he anſwered that he was a Doctor, and had practiſed and would practiſe within the ſayd City, as he conceived he might lawfully do, and for that ſhewing of this caſe he was committed to priſon, and he conceived two things upon the Charter.</p>

And the ſecond day the ſame caſe was argued again by <hi>Walmeſley</hi> Juſtice, and <hi>Coke</hi> cheife Juſtice, and <hi>Walmeſley</hi> argued as followeth, that is, <note place="margin">Walmeſley.</note> that the Statute of 3. <hi>H.</hi> 8. was in the negative, that no perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the City of <hi>London</hi> or ſeven Miles of that, take upon him to exerciſe or occupy, as Phyſitian or Chirurgion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he doth not know in any caſe where the words of the Statute are negative, that they admit any Interpretation againſt that but one only, and that is the Statute of <hi>Marlebridge chapter</hi> 4. Which provides that no Lord ſhall diſtrain in one County, and the beaſts diſtrayned drive into another County, in which caſe though that the words are uegative, yet if the Lord diſtrain in one County, he may drive the Beaſts to his Mannor in another County, of which the Lands, in which the diſtreſſe was taken were held, but it is equity and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in this caſe, that the Statute ſhould admit ſuch exception, for it is not of malice, but for that, that the Beaſts may remain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Fee, but in the principall caſe there is not the like reaſon nor Equity, And alſo the King <hi>H.</hi> 8. in his Letters Patents recites as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that is, <hi>Cum Regij officij nostri munus arbitremur, ditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis noſtri hominum felicitati omni ratione conſulere, id autem vel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primis fore, ſi Improborum conatibus tempeſtive occurremus, appri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me neceſſarium duximus improborum quoque hominum, qui medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant magis avaritiae ſue. cauſa quam ullius. bonae conſcienti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But to this the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> gave no anſwer, and for that it ſeemes they were no Grants, but confirmation rather of cuſtomes, and they further denied that the cuſtomes are confirmed by the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 7.

And if it be falſe the party greived may have an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the caſe, ſo it was agreed that the cuſtome, that no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainer ſhall hold any ſhop, nor ſell in any shop by retayl, and that they may make By-Lawes, for the ordering of their ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, are good cuſtomes without any confirmation by Act of Parliament, or Grant of the King or otherwiſe: And if any thing happen <hi>De novo,</hi> that they can <hi>apponere remedium</hi> with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions aforeſaid, for the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſaith that <hi>London</hi> is <hi>Antiqua civitas,</hi> and was of great fame and reckoning, amongſt the moſt ancient Cities, for it was ſaid by <hi>Anianus Marcellinus</hi> which wrote 1200. yeares paſt, that <hi>London</hi> was then <hi>Opidum vetuſtum, and Cornelius Tacitus in vita Neronis</hi> ſaith, that then there was under the Romans Government, there was here <hi>Negotiorum copia, &amp; commercia maximorum celebris,</hi> and he well knew for he was here ſeven years, and married the Daughter of <hi>Agricola,</hi> who was ancient <hi>Guilda Mercatoria,</hi> and for that it was well governed and continued in good Order, for <hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, By redemption which is power which only remaines in the Maior, and the Court of Aldermen, in this caſe in <hi>London,</hi> and ſuch Gyld can never have beginning but by Grant, but by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, as the cuſtome of Gavelkinde, that a man may deviſe his Lands, or that the Land ſhall diſcend to the youngeſt Son, and that the King cannot make, any ſtranger free of ſuch Gyld or <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi> appears in <hi>Rotulo patentium, 32 Ed.</hi> 3. Where the King by his Letters patents granted to one <hi>Iohn Faulchon,</hi> that he ſhould be
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:41383:279"/>
frank and free of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and that he ſhould keep an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries ſhop there, but the Patentee could not have his Freedome by this grant, and for that the King wrote his Letters to the Maior and Aldermen, and requeſted them to make the ſayd <hi>Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon</hi> free of the ſayd City, and upon that it was done accordingly, but not upon the Grant, and ſo it was adjudged in <hi>Darcies caſe 44. Eliz. Trinity,</hi> that if the King grant to one the ſole making of Cards in <hi>England,</hi> and that none ſhall bring any Cards into <hi>England</hi> to be ſold but the patentee, and it was adjudged that though none may may have Park or Warren, and ſuch other matters of Pleaſure with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kings Grant, and though that playing with Cardes be but a matter of Pleaſure, yet the making of them is a matter of profit, and the bringing of them into <hi>England</hi> is a matter of Trade, and the inhibition of that is hinderance of Trade, and makes a Monopoly, that the Grant was voyd, and 3 <hi>Ed. 3. 3. Iohn of Sudfords Caſe,</hi> where the Caſe was, a Free-holder levied a fold upon his Soyl, and Freehold of his own, and the Defendant ſpoyled it, and broke it, aed upon that the Plaintif brings a Writ of Treſpaſs; the Defendant juſtifies that he was Lord of the Town, and there had been a uſage there, and had been of time out of memory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That no man of the ſame Town ought to levy a fold without the agreement and leave of the Lord: And for that that the Plaintif had done it, the Defendant pulled it down as wel to him it was lawfull, and it ſeems a good cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, and with this agrees 5 <hi>Ed. 3. Iohn de Hayes caſe,</hi> and 10 and 11 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 279. 10. preſcription, by the Maior Sherif, and Citizens of <hi>York;</hi> Goods forraine bought and forrain ſold ſhall be forfeited, and that he may ſeiſe them it was adjuged a good preſcription, but the King by his Letters Patents, cannot give ſuch power to them.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Coke</hi> was cleerly of opinion, that the caſe was not within the Statute of 9 <hi>Ed. 3. chapt. 2. 25 Ed. 3. 11 27 Ed.</hi> 3. 11. And it was agreed by them all, that a Merchant or any other man may ſell Goods in groſſe, as he may ſell a hundred tun of wine, or peices of Cloath, and one Tun of Wine to one man, or a peice of Cloath to one man, and another to another man, till he hath ſold all, that this was not retailing, but they cannot ſell by the yard or keep a ſhop, but it was alſo agreed that ſome goods a man might ſell as well in their Market, if he do not keep a ſhop here without any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and it was objected that this By-Law was not good, for that it was for private good, and alſo the penalty which was to be inflicted was too great.</p>
                     <p>For firſt the Maior, Aldermen, and Citizens, make the Law, the ſuit for the penalty ought to be before the Mayor, and the Maior and Citizens ought to have part of the Penalty, ſo that the Mayor
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:41383:280"/>
ſhall be Judg in his own cauſe, which alſo was one of the Reaſons of the Judgment in the Chamberlain of <hi>Londons</hi> caſe 5. <hi>Coke</hi> for that that the penalty was ſo ſmall, that is a penny for every cloth which ſhall be ſold in <hi>Blackwell hall,</hi> and this was for publick good, for here shall be ſearch if it were good and merchantable, but it was agreed by all, that every Town may make a By-Law, which is <hi>pro bono publico,</hi> without any preſcription or cuſtome, and this shall be good, and being made by the greater part shall bind the reſidue, but if it be for private good, as for the ordering of the common or ſuch like, shall not be good to bind any man without his aſſent, without ſpeciall cuſtome, according to the Judgements in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine of <hi>Londons</hi> Caſe, and <hi>Clarkes</hi> caſe 5. <hi>of Coke</hi> in his caſes of By-Lawes: But <hi>Coke</hi> is cleer that the remedy, that is, the By-Law was good and agreeing to the cuſtome in every point, and that the penalty was fit and good, and for quantity and quality, and that to the quantity he agreed, that they could not inflict confiſcati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Goods nor Impriſonment, but may inflict pecuniary punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it appeares by <hi>Clarkes</hi> Caſe, and the Action may be brought for that, ſo that for the quality it was good: And ſo as to the quantity which was <hi>Secundum quantitatem dilicti,</hi> for he conceived it was a greater offence, to hold a private ſhop then pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, for this is not in view nor ſubject to ſearch &amp; reformation, as wel as if it were publick, and for an old Act of Common Councel, he which keeps a publick ſhop ſhall forfeit ten ſhillings, and <hi>clam delinquens punietur magis quam palam,</hi> &amp; now the ounce of ſilver is increaſed in value, for it is <hi>worth</hi> five ſhillings four pence, and then it was worth but three ſhillings four pence, and ſo for quantity and quality <hi>Et con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruum &amp; ratione cauſarum:</hi> And it ſeems to him that it is not <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na fide,</hi> that a Forrainer ſhould hold a private ſhop, but <hi>Diſſentane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> for <hi>London</hi> is a Market overt, every day in the Weeke, but Sunday, as it appears by 11 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 19. And in <hi>Dunſtable,</hi> the Prior brought an Action againſt a Butcher, for that that <hi>Dunſtable</hi> was an ancient Town, and that this was a market overt two dayes in the Week, and the Defendant ſold fleſh in an inward roome, the Defendant pleads cuſtome to warrant that, and adjudged that it was not good, for the uſage of Trade in ſuch Corners is not, <hi>Bonae fidei conſonant,</hi> and after he pleaded that he ſold the fleſh in an open ſhop in the Market, and this was allowed to be a good Plea, and if it be ſo in <hi>Dunſtable, a fortiori,</hi> it ſhall be ſo in <hi>London,</hi> and for the ſame reaſon alſo it ſhall not be <hi>Rationi Conſentaneum,</hi> to hold ſuch inward ſhops, and alſo it is for <hi>Communi utilitate,</hi> that is, of the Citizens of the King, and of all others, that Forrainers ſhall not hold any ſhops in <hi>London,</hi> for it appears by the return that Forrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhall not be ſubject to Scot and Lot in <hi>London,</hi> and ſhall not be
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:41383:280"/>
Officers which are matters of great charge, ſo that if it ſhall be ſo they ſhould be preferred before Free men, and without queſtion it is diſcomodious for the Citizens, that any Forrainer ſhould uſe any Trade here, and it would be a diſtruction to Citizens, that a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainer ſhould not be ſubject to their charges, and yet ſhould take benefit of the Trade within the City.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, And for the Benefit of others that ſtrangers should not be received to uſe any Trade within the City, for this is the cauſe of Depopulation, depradation, and diſtruction in all other Townes and Burroughs in <hi>England,</hi> which is prejudice to all others.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is prejudiciall to the King, that ſuch a company of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants should be reſident in <hi>London,</hi> which is <hi>Camera Regis,</hi> for this is the cauſe of Iufection of the Aire and ſickneſſe, ſo that the King and all the State is prejudiced by it, but the ſole doubt which was conceived by <hi>Coke,</hi> was for that that it doth not appear by the return, that the Defendant had uſed the Trade of Tallow Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor nor ſold any Candles, but only that he kept a shop, and uſed the miſtery of making Candles, but if the return had been that he uſed the Trade of Tallow Chandlor, this had been good, for that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies <hi>Tantamount,</hi> for that had been, that he had ſold, for Trade is in <hi>Tradendo,</hi> which is to deliver over, and the Intent of the act is not that hee shall be punished for making of Candles, if hee do not ſell them, for the ſale is the wrong, and ſo the Servant of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Noble man or other which makes Candles or other thing for his Maſter, or for his own uſe, should be within the penalty of the Act, and with this agreed <hi>Foſter and Daniel,</hi> and for this cauſe only it was reſolved that he should be delivered and not remanded.</p>

<pb n="298" facs="tcp:41383:285"/>
then the Plea shall be intended double, for it is of common Right, as it appeares by the <hi>Statute of Morton</hi> chap. 4. And the common is mutuall, for the Lord hath Right of Common in the Lands of the Tenant, and the Tenant in the Lands of the Lord: And it was urged by <hi>Nicholls</hi> Serjeant, that the Common shall be appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as if it were Rent, and that the Leſſee shall have Common for his Leaſe, and then the Leſſor hath no Common appurtenant or appendant to the two Virgats of Land, and for that the Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not good.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Coke</hi> cheife Juſtice, if it had been pleaded, that he had uſed to have Common for the ſaid Beaſts Levant and Couchant upon the ſaid Land, there had been no queſtion but it ſhould be apporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, for the Beaſtes are Levant and Couchant upon every part, as one day upon one part, and another day upon another part, and for that extinguishment or ſuſpention of part shall be of all, as if a man makes a Leafe of two Acres of Land, rendring Rent, and after bargaines and ſells the reverſion of one Acre, there shall be an apportionment of the Rent, as well as if it had been gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and attornment: And he agreed that if a man have Common appurtenant, and purchaſe parcell of the Land in which he hath Common, all the Common is extinct, but in this caſe common appendant ſhall be apportioned for the benefit of the Plow, for as it is appendant to Land, Hyde, and gain: And in the principall caſe there was common appendant, for it was pleaded to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to two Virgats of Land, and for commonable Beaſtes: And he conceived alſo that the preſcription being as appertaining to ſuch Land, that this shall be all one, as if it had been ſaid Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and couchant, for when they are appurtenant, they shall be intended to Plow, Manure, Compeſter, and Feed upon the Land: And alſo he conceived that the right of Common remaines in the Leſſor, and for that he may preſcribe, for after the end of the Tearme shall be returned, and in the intermin he may Bargain and ſell and the Vendee shall have it, and ſhall have common for his Portion.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Walmeſley</hi> Juſtice agreed to that, and that during the <note place="margin">Walmeſley.</note> Tearme the Leſſor shall be excluded of his Common for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Foſter</hi> Juſtice agreed, and that the poſſeſſion of the Leſſee is the <note place="margin">Foſter.</note> poſſeſſion of the Leſſor, but he conceived when the Leſſor grants to the Leſſee ſix acres of Land in ſuch a feild where the Land lies, and then the Beaſts were taken in another feild: And ſo they agreed for the matter in Law, and alſo that the pleading was ill, and ſo confeſſe and avoid the preſcription: But upon the traverſe
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:41383:285"/>
as it is pleaded, the Jury shall not take benefit of it, and Judgement was given accordingly.</p>

                     <p>IN Treſpaſſe the caſe was this, the King by his Letters Patents <note place="margin">Grant of the King of Alnage.</note> created the Duke of <hi>Lenox Alneger,</hi> and he made his deputy: And the Duke by the ſaid <hi>Letters Patents</hi> of the King, was to meaſure all Clothes, and to have ſo much for every Peece, and to ſearch and to view that if it be well and ſufficiently made or not, and he made his Deputy, which offers to meaſure, ſearch, and view, certain parcell of Worſted, and demanded the duty due to the <hi>Alneger</hi> for that, and for that, that the owner refuſed to pay it, he ſeiſed certain peeces of Worſted, and kept them, upon which this Action was brought.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Haughton</hi> Serjeant for the Defendant, conceived that the <note place="margin">Haughton.</note> ſole queſtion reſts upon theſe <hi>Letters Patents</hi> of the King, and for that he would firſt conſider.</p>
                     <p>Firſt if theſe duties of Subſidies and Auſnage are due by the Common Law, and if they are not due by the Common Law,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:41383:287"/>
then if they are due by Statute Law: And if they be due, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Common Law, nor Statute Law; then if the King by his <hi>Letters Patents</hi> may grant it.</p>
                     <p>And to the firſt he ſaid: That Subſidy is ayd or help: And there are two manners of ayd, one which is Inheritance in the King, as ayd to make his Son Knight, or to marry his Daughter, and others which are given by grant of others, and theſe are not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances in the King; and theſe duties were not demandable by the Common Law, nor by Cuſtome: And this appeares by the 25. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 6. Where any priſes were demanded which were due by the common Law, and ſome which were not due, and ſubſidie for Woolls were not due by the Common Law, but it was granted to the King and is now due, but this is by grant, and not by the Common Law, and in the 14. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. A Statute was made for the King for his ſubſidy for Woolles, what part he ſhould have, which part was given to him in quantity; and in time of <hi>H.</hi> 6. A Statute was made by which ſubſidy was given to him during his life, and 36, <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Subſidy was granted for three yeares, and after ſhould not be any ſubſidy paied, as appeares by 45. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. And if ſubſidie were not due by the Common Law for Woolles, then may it be concluded, that it was not due for clothes, for Woolles grow without mans labour, and the 11. <hi>H. 4. and 13. H.</hi> 4. The King makes a grant of Alnage of clothes, and a Writ is awarded to the Mayor and Sheriffs of <hi>London,</hi> to give poſſeſſion to the Patentee, which returnes the Writ, that the Office was not granted before this time: And the <hi>Statute of 24. Ed.</hi> 3. was the firſt <hi>Statute</hi> that gave profit to the King for clothes: But he granted that the Office of Alneger was of ancient times, and an ancient Office, but it was no Office of profit, but an Office of Juſtice and Right; and no Fee was due for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of it, and that 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 2, was a Grant of the Office of the Alneger, and 11. <hi>H.</hi> 4. was a Grant of the Office of Alneger for Canvas, but it doth not appeare by any account, that the King had any profit for the Alnage it ſelfe, or upon the ſaid Grants, either before or after, and allowing that there were accounts for Cloth, yet it doth not appeare that there were any accounts for Worſteds, The <hi>Statute of 27. Eliz.</hi> gives ſubſidy of four pence for every broad Cloth, ſo that the <hi>Statute</hi> made expreſſe mention of broad Cloth, but there was not any mention of Worſteds, and this <hi>Statute</hi> ſhall not be taken by equity, though that the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 1.

where Debt is brought againſt diverſe Executors, that they ſhall have but one Eſſoyn, and the <hi>Statute</hi> mentions Execurors only, yet Adminiſtrators are taken within the equity of this <hi>Statute,</hi> as it appeares by 3, <hi>H.</hi> 6. yet in this caſe at the Bar, <hi>the Statute of 27.

Ed.</hi> 6. by which diverſe Chantryes were granted to the King, it ſhall be intended a Grant within the <hi>Statute of 31. H.</hi> 8. of Monaſtries which was before: But further he ſaid that the matter is inſufficient to raiſe a duty to the King, for in vain is the property of any thing in one man if another man may charge it: And in this caſe the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grant theſe Clothes, and for that he cannot charge them, and the <hi>Letters Patents</hi> of the King are not ſufficient only to charge the Goods of any man, ſee the caſe of 11. <hi>H.</hi> 4. But he agreed that if the King grant a Ferrey, and that every paſſenger shall pay for his paſſage four pence, this is good, for every man may choſe whether he will paſſe by that or not: And none shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to paſſe by that, but Grant of the King to one, that none shall bring in any Cards into <hi>England</hi> but the Patentee only is vord; and it was adjudged in <hi>Nicholls</hi> Caſe in 18. <hi>Eliz.</hi> That if any man offend in not repayring of a Bridge, the King cannot par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it, for the Subjects of the King have Intereſt in that, and further he ſaith, that the Grant was againſt an expreſſe <hi>Statute</hi> made in 7. <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 1. for this appoints that the Alneger shall not take any Fee, by which the Grant of the ſayd Office shall be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Fee, and this Grant is with a Fee, that is, ſo much for every Cloth, he agreed that this is an affirmitive Law, and for that it shall not bind the King generally, but when it is for determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of right or wrong, the King ſhall be bound by that, and the Patent is grounded upon the <hi>Statute of 27. Eliz. or 47. Ed.</hi> 3. 1. which are made for the breadth of Clothes; and here the Patent hath not any reſpect to it, for if the peece be but of the breadth of a foote, if it be in length according to the Statute, ſo much ſhall be payd for that as if it were a broad Cloth, and for that there is not any equity in it, that the Statute ſeemes to intend, for the charge ought to be correſpendent to the quantity of the Cloth, as 41. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 16.

It is provided that <hi>una menſura,</hi> and <hi>una latitudo pannorum tinctorum, ruſſatorum, &amp; Haubergettarum,</hi> that is, <hi>Duo ulne infra list as per totum Regnum Anglie,</hi> and 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Rolls of the Patents in the Tower, it appears that the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Alneger was granted <hi>De omnibus pannis tam ultra mare quam infra mare:</hi> And 1. <hi>R,</hi> 2. was another Grant of the Office of Alneger, and 14. <hi>R.</hi> 2. the King granted the Office of Alneger in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and by the <hi>Statute of 5. Ed.</hi> 2. it is provided that the eſtretes by the Warden of the Alnage ſhould be delivered into the Exchequer to the Treaſurer of the Exchequer, and 17. <hi>Ed,</hi> 2. the Office of Alneger was granted to one <hi>J. Griffin</hi> of all the clothes made beyond Sea, till the 1. <hi>of Ed.</hi> 3. by which the uſe appeares in the time of the Raigne of King <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. upon which records he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Office of an Alneger is an ancient Office, and that he hath power to ſee, ſearch, and meaſure, <hi>omnies pannas tam ultra marinas quam infra marinas,</hi> without any exception, and for that it cannot be denied, but that he ought to meddle with wollen clothes, and he ought to meddle with all for one ſelfe ſame end and purpoſe, that is to faſten a Seale to them. Secondly, That the Law depends upon the Art and invention of Artiſts, then no Law ſhall prevent more miſcheifes, for there is no end of Art and Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And thirdly, and that in this <hi>Individuo,</hi> for there is not any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:41383:288"/>
made of Worſteds, till the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. for it was a new commodity, and then firſt Invented, and after it was firſt invented, there was immediately an Officer made for that, and for this it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that 1 <hi>Ed. 3. Nicholas Shoverler</hi> was made generall Alneger for that, and after that came <hi>Wadlowes and Sayes,</hi> and alſo an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger was immediately made for them, by which it appears, that ſo ſoon as new ſtuff was invented by the Artiſt that there was a new Officer to ſearch, and ſee that, and prevent that deceit ſhould not be uſed in it, and then for the Fee of the Alneger, that is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon a juſt Law, which is the Law of <hi>Retrebution, for Dignus est operarius mercede,</hi> and though it doth not appear by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, that they had taken any Fee for the exerciſing of their ſayd Office, yet it appears by their Accounts that they have had a Fee for it, and if they have no Fee of the King, then it follows that they ought to have a Fee of the Subject by Common Law, the Office being for the publick good, and the Patent is, upon which the Duke ſhall have the ſayd Office as hitherto they have had it, and it appears by the 11 of <hi>H.</hi> 4. 58. and the 12 of <hi>H.</hi> 4. That the King may grant and annex Fee to a neceſſary Office to be taken of the Subjects, but it was objected that the Alneger had no Fee, and if he had that, he was abridged of that by the <hi>Statute of 2 Ed.</hi> 3. 14. Where it is ſayd that they ſhall be ready to make proofe; when they ſhould be required to meaſure, without taking any thing of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, but this refers only to the Maiors and Bailiffs of Towns, where ſuch Cloathes ſhall come, and not to the Alneger, and that the <hi>Statute of 11 Ed. 3. chapter</hi> 3. conſiſts upon two parts.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that Clothiers may make Cloth of what length and breadth that they will.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond, that no Cloth ſhall be brought into <hi>England, Wales,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> but that which is made in them, and then if the Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiers have ſuch liberty to make Cloath of what length and breadth they will, then there is no need of Alneger: As to that it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that there was need of him to ſee and ſearch the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that, as well as the length and breadth, And alſo the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 25 Ed. 3. chap.</hi> 4. Provides that all Clothes vendable, which ſhall be ſold whole Cloathes in <hi>England,</hi> in whoſe hands ſoever they are, ſhall be meaſured by the Alneger of the King, and the <hi>Statute of 27 Ed. 3 chapter</hi> 4. Statute the firſt, provides that no Cloathes ſhall be forfeited, though they be not of the ſame <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> but the Alneger of the King ſhall meaſure the Cloath and mark it, with ſuch a mark, that a man may know how much that contains; ſo for theſe <hi>Statutes,</hi> and for the reaſons aforeſaid it appears, that it belongeth to the Office of an Alneger to ſurvey, meaſure, and marke Cloathes, as well by the Common Law, as by the Statute
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:41383:289"/>
Law; It was objected, firſt that the <hi>Statute of 27 Ed.</hi> 3. limits and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points that the Alneger ſhould meaſure broad Cloath, and doth not make mention of any other Cloathes, but broad Cloathes, and for that it ſeems that he ſhall not meddle with any other Cloathes, but it appears by diverſe Accounts, that he ſhould meddle with Wadlowes and Sayes, and the Statute of the 17 <hi>R.</hi> 2. chap. 2. Provides that none ſhall ſell any Cloath before that it be meaſured by the Alneger of the King, and that none ſhall make any deceit in Ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Objection that Cloathes of Leſſer <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> then halfe broad Cloath, the Alneger ſhall take nothing by the Statute of 27 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. This is intended of Broad Cloath which hath uſed to be ſold, and theſe be in lenght above the broad Cloath, and in breadth as Kerſeyes, and others were but as Remnants which have not been uſed to be ſold, no ſubſidye was due by the Common Law, for that is granted by the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> And in this Grant two things are to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the <hi>Statute of 2 Ed. 3. and the Statute made at Northampton,</hi> where it was petitioned to the Parliament, that the King would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the penalties, aad the Kiug ſhould have recompence for the loſs, and for this the Statute gives ſubſidy, this was no private gift, but a publick gift, and the reaſon of this was the retribution of his loſs and the King payd for it, and that for this he ſhould have a Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Woolls are the continuall Treaſure of the Realm, and let them be of what nature they will they are called <hi>Panui:</hi> And for that when the King hath a ſettled Inheritance, it is no reaſon that the ſlight of an Artiſt ſhould prejudice the King: And it appeares by the <hi>Statute of 11 H.</hi> 4. 7. that was made to prevent the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling of Clothes, and the making of them into Garments, and the tranſporting of them beyond Sea.</p>
                     <p>And alſo the third reaſon is uſage, for all other clothes pay Subſidy, and there is no other Law to charge them but the <hi>Statute</hi> of 27 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 4. That this ſubſidy is ſetled in the King, and no deviſe of man may diveſt it, the <hi>Statute of 27. Ed.</hi> 3. and 47. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. Set down and alter the length and breadth of clothes, and yet the Cuſtome remaines.</p>
                     <p>The fifth objection that the Statute doth not extend in equity to a thing which is not in <hi>Rerum natura</hi> at the time of the making of the <hi>ſtatute</hi> which is falſe poſition, for how can makers of <hi>ſtatutes</hi> prevent all miſcheifes, <hi>Eaton and Studdes</hi> caſe <hi>Com. Ariſtotle</hi> in <hi>Ethicks liber 5. chap.</hi> 10. ſaith, that <hi>Equitas eſt correctio legis</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Statutes, how to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Bracton</hi> in his firſt Book of new <hi>Diviſion Ch. 3. ſaith, that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitas
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:41383:289"/>
eſt rerum convenientia que in paribus cauſis, paria deſiderat jura &amp; omnia bene coequi paret &amp; dicitur equitas quaſi equalitas,</hi> and for that it is enacted by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 11 <hi>Ed. 1. Acton Burnell</hi> for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the <hi>Statute,</hi> that if prayſers of Goods prayſe them at too high a value, that they themſelves ſhall have them at the ſame price at which they were prayſed, and after another <hi>Statute</hi> is made, which provides, that lands ſhall be extended upon a <hi>Statute,</hi> which is taken to be within the <hi>Statute of Acton Burnell,</hi> which was made before, and ſo it appears by <hi>Littleton</hi> that the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> provides, that warranty by Tenant by the Curteſie ſhall not bind the Heir without Aſſets, and an Eſtate tayl was not then cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated but it was afterwards created by the <hi>Statute of Westminſter</hi> 2. which was made the 13 of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. Yet this Warranty ſhall not binde the Heire in tayl, and alſo two objections have been made againſt the Patent.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, That it was againſt an expreſſe <hi>ſtatute.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, That it did not obſerve any rate or proportion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the quantity of the peece, to that he anſwered, that it is not againſt any <hi>ſtatute,</hi> ſee 7, <hi>Ed. 4. 2. 27. H, 7. 5. H. 8. 2. 1. and 2. Phil. and Mary:</hi> It is not againſt any of thoſe, for thoſe provides and ordaines, that there ſhall be Wardens for the better performance of all things which are to be done by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, and doth not deprive the King of any thing given to him by any former <hi>ſtatute,</hi> but adds further care and deligence, and when there is a Law which adds care and Manner and Forme to a former Law: That doth not abridge and deprive the former Law, of any thing given by that, and if the Wardens do not do their Office, yet that cannot prevent but that the Alneger may do it, which to him belongeth, as in 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 2. For Indentures taken in Sheriffs Turnes, which should be delivered by Indenture to the Juſtices, yet the Juſtices may proceed, though they be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by Indenture, and ſo it is in 43. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 11. The Sheriff ought to array his Pannell four daies before the taking of that, and adjudged that if he doth not, it ſhall be no error in 43. <hi>Ed. 3. Aſſiſe</hi> 22. and ſo the <hi>Statute of 5. and 6. of Ed.</hi> 6. provides that the Mayor appoints to viewers and ſearchers, this doth not abridge the power of the Alneger, for this is but an addition of greater care and diligence, and by the <hi>ſtatute of 39. and 43. Eliz.</hi> If upon a ſearch they find any forfeyture, they ſhall have it, but if they do not find the Alneger may find it, and then the King ſhall have it.</p>
                     <p>And to the Second he anſwered; that true it is for every 64. of clothes, the Alneger ought to have foure pence, for his Fee, and though that ſome peeces of cloth are more broade then others,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:41383:290"/>
yet the lobour of the Alneger to meaſure them is all one: So he concluded, and demanded Judgement for the plaintiff.</p>

Tearme was deviſed to one, and if he died within the Tearme, then to ſuch of the Daughters of the Deviſor, which then ſhould not be preferred, the Deviſor dieth; the Tearme was extended for the Debt of the firſt Deviſee, and then he died, the extent was avoided by the Daughters not preferred, and they grounded their Judgement upon the former Judgements in <hi>Weltden and Elting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> caſe, and <hi>Paramores and Yardleys</hi> caſe in the <hi>Comment.</hi> and for that the Law intends that a Deviſor is <hi>Inops conſillij,</hi> and for that his deviſe ſhall have favourable conſtruction according to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent appearing within the deviſe, and it was ſaid by <hi>Coke</hi> that in many caſes, a man may make ſuch an Eſtate by deviſe, that he cannot make by an Act executed in his life time, as it was adjudged in <hi>Graveners</hi> caſe, where a man deviſes his Lands to his Executors for payment of his Debts, that there the Executors have Intereſt, that there the Executor of Executors ſhal have that, and ſuch Eſtate cannot be executed by Act in the life of the Deviſor, and ſo it was concluded by them all, that the Son ſhall avoid the Leaſe made by the Father, for the Deviſe was Executory, and doth not veſt till the full age of the Son, and then Executor, and ſhall avoid all Acts made by the Father, by which Judgement was given accordingly.</p>

                        <hi>Nullum fecit Arbitrium</hi> was pleaded, and upon demurrer, it was objected that the award was void.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, For that it was for one party only, and nothing was arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated of the other, and to prove this the Book of 7. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 6. was cited, <hi>and 39. H. 6. 9. ſee 2 R. 3. 18. b.</hi> And this alſo appeares by the pleading of an award, for he which pleades it; that he hath performed all things which are to be performed of his part:
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:41383:291"/>
And that the other pleades performance of all thing which are to be performed of his part, by which it appeares that there ought to be performance of both parts, and by conſequence one award to both parties, according to 22. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 52.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the award was void, for that, that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was of all controverſies, ſo that the Arbitrator deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his award of all controverſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there was no award of the ſaid Suit between the parties, and for that he hath not <note place="margin">Arbitrement.</note> made an Arbitrement of all controverſies, and by that the award was void, and to prove that, the Bookes in 4 <hi>Eliz.

Where it is ſaid, that if the ſubmiſſion were of all things, and the Arbitrement of one only, that is a void Arbitrement.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, For that it was not limited within the award, at what day, nor at what place the money ſhould be paid by the Heire to the Adminiſtrator, and for this cauſe alſo it ſhall be void, for it ought to be payd immediatly; and if the Heire cannot find the Adminiſtrator, he forthwith hath forfeyted his Obligation, and for that in this point it is uncertain, and for that ſhall be void, as it is in <hi>Samons</hi> caſe, 5. <hi>Coke 77. b.</hi> Where the Arbitrator a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, that one party ſhall enter into Bond to another for injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of certain Lands, and doth not ſay in what Sum, and adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed void for the uncertainty, and ſo in this caſe by which, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But it was anſwered and reſolved, that the Arbitrement was good.</p>
                     <p>And to the firſt objection it was reſolved, and agreed, that every award ought to have reſpect to both parties, if it be not a matter which concernes one party only, and neither recompence nor acquittall due to the other party in which caſe the award ſhall be good: And it was reſolved in the principall caſe, that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was made of both parties, for one was to have money, and the other though there was no expreſſe mention, that the other ſhould be diſcharged of his Aſſumpſit, yet the award was a good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge in Law, and may be pleaded in Bar upon an Action brought upon the Aſſumpſit, and ſo it was for both parties.</p>
                     <p>And to the ſecond objection, it was agreed, that where ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is, with <hi>Ita quod, &amp;c.</hi> as above, that there the Arbitrators ought to make arbitrement, of all the variances and controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, referred to their arbitrement, and if they do make no ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement, of all the matters of which the ſubmiſſion is made, the award is void, but if the ſubmiſſion be generall, as of all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in variance or controverſie between them: There if the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator makes his award of all matters which are known to him, the award ſhall be good: As my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> conceived, though that
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:41383:291"/>
there are other matters in variance, of which the Arbitrator hath no notice, as if divers Creditors ſue a-commiſſion, upon the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of <hi>Barkrupts,</hi> and an another perſon to whome the <hi>Bankrupt</hi> was indebted, doth not come in as a Creditor, nor give notice to the Commiſſioners, that the <hi>Bankrupt</hi> was indebted to him, he shall not take benefit of the commiſſion, for the Commiſſioners can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not releive thoſe Creditors of which they have no notice, as it appeares by the caſe <hi>of Bankrupts</hi> in 2. <hi>Coke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to the third objection it was anſwered and reſolved, that the award was good, notwithſtanding that no place be expreſſed where the money shall be paid, for in Law that ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable conſtruction, and the party ought to have reaſonable time for the payment of that, but <hi>Foſter</hi> conceived that it is not good, for it ſeemed to him, that if the award shall be good, that the Obligation of ſubmiſſion ſhall be immediatly forfeyted, for that there was neither time nor place, where the money should be payd, but this was anſwered with the Bookes of 3. <hi>H. 7. 16. Ed.</hi> 4. Where it is ſaid that if an Arbitrator award that one party ſhall pay ſuch a ſum of money at ſuch a day, and keeps the award in his Pocket till ſuch a day be paſt, that yet the Obligation ſhall not be forfeyted: And ſo it was reſolved and adjudged by all the other Juſtices, that the award was good, and Judgement was entred accordingly.</p>

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:41383:292"/>
that it is no plenary ſatisfaction, but only reſtraint of his liberty, which the Law more reſpects then Goods or Lands, and for that <hi>Cuſtodia</hi> ought to be <hi>Salva &amp; ſtricta:</hi> So by this the party may be Inforced to pay his Debt <hi>Salva,</hi> to the party, ſo that by this the party may be ſafely detained, till he hath ſatisfied the Debt, and <hi>Stricta</hi> to the King, ſo that by this Juſtice may be ſatisfied, and for that <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith; that it is only to compell the party to make ſatisfaction: And it is reſolved in the 33. <hi>H.</hi> 6. 47. That it is no ſatisfaction, but that the Body ſhould remain as a Pledge, till ſatisfaction a were made, or as return Irrepleviſable, and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one nor the other are ſatisfaction: And the words of the Writ are <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum,</hi> the party, but if he will ſatisfie then there is no reaſon that the Defendant ſhall be Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by the Writ: But if he will not pay, then he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in Priſon, <hi>Quouſque ſatisfecerit,</hi> by which it appeares that the Impriſonment is no ſatisfaction, and it appeares alſo by the Regiſter, and <hi>Fitz.

after, for that, that he cannot have his purpoſe according to his firſt election. And if any be in this caſe, then upon that he inferrred that the party in this caſe may have a <hi>Fieri Facias</hi> againſt the <hi>Executors.</hi> And alſo it is reſolved by the whole Court in the Common Bench, 29 <hi>H. 8. B. Execution</hi> 132. That if two are bound in an <hi>Obligation, conjunctim &amp; deviſim,</hi> the Obligee impleads one, and hath <hi>execution</hi> of his body, and after impleads the other, and condemns him, hee may have <hi>Execution</hi> againſt him alſo, for the taking of the body is good <hi>execution,</hi> but it is no ſatisfaction, and therefore he may take the other alſo: but if he have ſatisfied the <hi>Plaintiffe,</hi> he ſhall not have <hi>execution</hi> afterwards. And therefore this Order, that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> upon an <hi>Obligation</hi> ſhall have but one <hi>Execution</hi> is intended ſuch an <hi>Execution,</hi> which is a ſatisfaction: See 33 <hi>H. 6. 48. b. 4 H. 7. 8. 4 Edw. 4. 38. 5 Edw. 4. 4. 5 Coke 92. Blumfields</hi> caſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by all the Court, that if the <hi>Defendant</hi> in debt dye in <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that the <hi>Defendant</hi> ſhall have new <hi>execution</hi> by <hi>Elegit</hi> or <hi>Fieri Facias,</hi> for the death of the <hi>Defendant</hi> is the act of God, which ſhall not turn the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> to prejudice, as it is ſaid in <hi>Trewynyards</hi> caſe, 38 <hi>H. 8. Dyer</hi> 60. The <hi>Plaintiff</hi> ſhall not be prejudiced of his <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> by act in Law, which makes no wrong to any. And to the firſt Objection which may be made againſt him, that is, That all proceſſe are determined after the party is taken, and in <hi>execution;</hi> to that he anſwered, that this is where the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> hath ſatisfactory <hi>execution,</hi> as it appears by 41 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 13. where an action of Account was brought againſt two, one was out-lawed, and the other comes by <note place="margin">Outlawry.</note> the Exigent, and enters in the Court; and he which was out-lawed, obtained his charter of pardon, and for that, that proceſſe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined againſt him. And the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> hath choſen to have his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction againſt the other, he prayed that he may be diſcharged. But it was reſolved, that the proceſſe was not determined, nor he which was out-lawed ſhall not be diſcharged, till the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> be ſatisfied, by which it appears that the proceſs is not determined till <hi>execution</hi> with ſatisfaction. Two other Objections alſo he endeavoured to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that is, that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> hath determined his <hi>election</hi> by taking the <hi>Capias,</hi> and that cannot reſort to any other Proceſs: and to that he agreed, that where the party hath made ſuch <hi>election,</hi> that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſort to any other Proceſs, during the life of the party. But if the ſatisfaction be prevented by the act of God, as in the principall caſe. But when his perſon which was the pledg for the debt, and was to remain in priſon till the debt be ſatisfied, is diſcharged by the act of God, and the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> hath not the fruit of his Suit, nor the Judgement is not ſatisfied, and the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> hath done all that hee can, and there was no defect in him, it is no reaſon, but that he may have new proceſſe; and the third objection is a Judgment which was
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:41383:293"/>
given in the Kings Bench, <hi>Paſche 43. Eliz. Rot.</hi> 58. between <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> and <hi>Curtiz:</hi> And to that he ſaid, that he he conceived, that this was a rule for default of proſecution, for the cauſe was referred to Arbitrement, and ſo hanged for long time: and ſo though the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was directly againſt Law in the principall points, yet for that, that it was not upon ſolemn argument of the Judges, hee ſaith it is not to be compared to other authorities by him cyted before, for which he includes, and prayed Judgment for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>

                        <hi>Hutton</hi> Serjeant that argued for the <hi>Defendants</hi> conceived the <note place="margin">Hutton.</note> contrary, and firſt he examined how the body of a man cometh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and lyable to any <hi>Execution,</hi> and to that he ſaid, that by the Common Law the body was not ſubject to <hi>Execution</hi> for the debt of any man, but in accompt only a <hi>Capias ad computandum</hi> lyes, and no other proceſſe in this action, but diſtreſſe infinite till the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Marlbridge,</hi> Chap. 23. and <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. Chap. 11. <hi>Capias</hi> was given in Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt; for by the Common Law, the Proceſſe in that was Diſtreſſe Infinite as aforeſaid, and after by the <hi>Statute</hi> of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. Chapter 17. Such like Proceſſe was given in debt, as in accompt, and before that the body of the <hi>Defendant</hi> was not lyable to <hi>execution</hi> for debt, if it be not in the Kings caſe, as it appeares by Sir <hi>William Harberts</hi> caſe, 12. <hi>a.</hi> And upon this he inferred upon the words of the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> of 25 <hi>Ed. 3. Chap.</hi> 17. which ſaith, that ſuch like Proceſſe ſhal be in debt, as were in accompt: That after the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his election, and taken a <hi>Capias,</hi> that then he is in the ſame caſe as if it had been in accompt, and for that he cannot reſort to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proceſſe. And he ſaid that the words of the <hi>Elegit</hi> and <hi>Fieri Facias</hi> do not differ in ſubſtance from the words of <hi>Capias,</hi> for there is to ſatisfie the party, as well as in the other: And when a man hath made his Election to have <hi>Elegit,</hi> he ſhall not have other Execution. But when the <hi>Defendant</hi> hath neither goods nor Lands, Then <hi>qui non habet in are licet in Corpore,</hi> and the <hi>Plaintiffe</hi> at the firſt when he hath Judgment hath election to have <hi>Fieri Facias, Elegit,</hi> or <hi>Capias,</hi> then he cannot have <hi>fieri facias;</hi> but if he determine his Election at the firſt, and ſue <hi>Elegit</hi> or <hi>Capias,</hi> then he cannot have <hi>fieri facias,</hi> but may firſt ſue <hi>fieri facias,</hi> and after <hi>Elegit</hi> or <hi>Capias,</hi> as it appears by the 15 H. 7. 15. 14 H. 7. 28. and 7 H. 6. 7. But if it be upon <hi>Statute ſtaple,</hi> Then he may have execution for his Body, Goods, and Land together, as it appears by 31 H. 6. 47. <hi>Lynnacres</hi> Caſe is put in <hi>Blunfields</hi> caſe, 5 <hi>Coke 92. b.</hi> and 15 H. 7. 15. But the reaſon of this is, that a ſpeciall Execution by <hi>ſtatute</hi> is given in this caſe. And he agreed, that where a Judgement is given againſt 2 or 3. and the <hi>Plaentiff</hi> ſue <hi>Capias</hi> againſt one of them, by that he hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined his Election: So that if he dye in Priſon or otherwiſe, he may ſue another <hi>Capias</hi> againſt the others, but he cannot ſue <hi>fieri facias,</hi>
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:41383:293"/>
or <hi>Elegit,</hi> as it appears by 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 47. before; and <hi>Blunfields</hi> caſe, 5 <hi>Coke 92. b. 4 H.</hi> 7. 8. And he ſaid that the body is the principall, and becomes chargeable by <hi>ſtatute:</hi> and it appears by 22 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 43. That when the party is in Priſon, that this is adjudged in Law an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution</hi> for the party: and further in the Booke of 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 47. is but the opinion of <hi>Priſot</hi> and <hi>Lacon:</hi> And the principall caſe there depends upon another point, <hi>Fitz.</hi> 246. before cyted, is but a quere, and <hi>Eitz.</hi> himſelf doubted of it; and the book of 44 <hi>Edw. 3. Fitz. Execution,</hi> 41. is but the opinion of <hi>Percye;</hi> But the Judgment upon the principall point is otherwiſe. And the principall caſe in <hi>Blunfields</hi> caſe, 5 <hi>Coke,</hi> was upon another point alſo, as it appears by the Booke, and ſo he concluded with the Judgment before cyted to be in the Kings Bench, <hi>Paſche 43 Eliz.</hi> between <hi>Williams</hi> and <hi>Cuttris,</hi> which was direct in the point according to his opinion, and prayed Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the <hi>Defendants</hi> in the <hi>Scire Facias,</hi> and it is adjourned.</p>
                     <p>This Caſe was argued in <hi>Trinity</hi> Tearm next enſuing, by all the Judges of the Common Pleas: and firſt <hi>Foster</hi> the youngeſt Judg ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned, <note place="margin">Foſter.</note> that the death of the <hi>Defendant</hi> in Priſon being in <hi>Execution,</hi> was no ſatisfaction, but the <hi>Plaintiffe</hi> may have a new <hi>execution</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his <hi>Executors,</hi> for he ſaid it was an old ſaying, <hi>That debts went before deadly ſinne:</hi> And that every one ought to ſatisfie his debts by the Law of God, before Legacies given to charitable uſes: And ſo by the Law of the Realm, if it be not the default of the <hi>Plaintiffe,</hi> as it was not in our Cauſe; for the death of the <hi>Defendant</hi> in Priſon was the act of God, and the <hi>Executors</hi> have confeſſed by pleading that they have aſſets, and the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> hath nothing but griefe and pain; and he ſaid as before, that at the Common Law no <hi>Capias</hi> lay, till the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>Marlebridge, Chap.</hi> 23. and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the 2. <hi>Chap. 11. Capias</hi> was given in Accompt, and then the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of 25 <hi>Edw. 3. Chap.</hi> 17. gives ſuch like Proceſſe in debt which was in Accompt, and then in Accompt <hi>Capias ad Computandum</hi> lyes, and in debt <hi>Capias ad Satisfaciendum:</hi> And if in Accompt the <hi>Defendant</hi> was adjudged to accompt, and <hi>Capias ad Computandum</hi> be awarded, and he taken by force of that, and committed to Priſon, and here dyes, a new Writ ſhall be awarded: So in debt, if the <hi>Defendant</hi> be taken by <hi>Capias ad ſatisfaciendum,</hi> new Writ ſhall be awarded againſt his <hi>Executors,</hi> ſee 1 <hi>Edw. 3. 24. 1 H. 7. 5 Coke 92. Blundfields</hi> caſe; for it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the default of the <hi>Defendant,</hi> that the debt is not ſatisfied, and for that it is no reaſon that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> ſhould be prejudiced by that: <note place="margin">Debt upon eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape againſt whom.</note> and 11 H. 4. 44. and 45. by <hi>Skreene,</hi> Debt upon an Eſcape doth not lye againſt the Executor of the Sheriff, but new Proceſſe ſhall be awarded againſt the Priſoner which is eſcaped; for a man ſhall not take advantage of his own wrong, as in the caſe of <hi>Littleton.</hi> If the ſonn makes diſſeiſin, and enfeoffs the Father, which dyes, the ſonne
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:41383:294"/>
ſhall not take advantage of this Diſcent, becauſe he was <hi>particeps cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi> and he ſaid it was no wrong to any, if <hi>execution</hi> were made of the goods of the <hi>Teſtator,</hi> and it is miſchievous to the <hi>Plaintiffe,</hi> for he ſhall looſe his debt: And to the Objections which have been made, that there is an end of Proceſſe when the <hi>Defendant</hi> is taken by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias,</hi> and dyes in <hi>Execution,</hi> the which he agreed as long as the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant</hi> lived, but after his death he may make new election, 47 <hi>Ed. 3. Fitz. Execution,</hi> 41. by <hi>Percye.</hi> And it appears by the pleading in 17 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. That <hi>Judgment</hi> &amp; <hi>Execution</hi> without ſatisfaction is no Plea in Bar. And alſo he cyted the Regiſter, 285. and <hi>Fitz. Na. Bre. 246. 19. Ed.</hi> 3. 21 H. 6. 5. where the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had effectual <hi>execution,</hi> which was ſatisfaction, 44 <hi>Ed. 3. 21 Edw. 4. 1 Edw.</hi> 4. 8 H. 7. 16 H. 7. to the ſame purpoſe, for which <hi>Dodridge</hi> cyted them before. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he ſaid, that the Judges have always had reſpect to the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Debts, and for that would not bayle one in <hi>Execution</hi> upon a Writ of Errour, where Errour indeed was aſſigned, but ſuffers him to remain in Priſon till the Judgment were reverſed. But here the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> hath neither Bale nor any ſatisfaction but griefe and pain: And in the 21 of H. 7. the Sheriff returned, that the <hi>Defendant</hi> had no land, but lands in uſe, and was adjudged that he ſhould execute the <hi>Elegit</hi> upon theſe Lands, ſuch was the reſpect that the Judges have to Executions, and to the Caſe of 35 H. 6. 47. This is but the opinion of <hi>Lacon,</hi> which erred in the principall caſe, and may as wel erre in this point: and his opinion alſo is ſo intricately penned, that he cannot underſtand it: And <hi>Martins</hi> opinion alſo in 7 H. 6. 7. is againſt the Judgment of the principall caſe. And to the Objection, that the Party had determined his Election by the Execution of the <hi>Capias,</hi> he agreed to that with this difference, that is, if the Plaintiff ſue <hi>Scire facias,</hi> &amp; the Sheriff levyed part, that this notwithſtanding the Plaintiff may have <hi>Capias</hi> for the reſidue, and ſo <hi>Elegit</hi> after <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eri facias,</hi> or <hi>Capias,</hi> for there is not any Entry made of awarding of <hi>fieri facias,</hi> or <hi>Elegit:</hi> But the Plaintiff only ſued that out of the Court, ſee 44 <hi>Edw. 3. 18 Ed. 4. 31 Ed. 3. 17 Ed. 3. 20 Ed. 2. 22 Aſſiſ.</hi> 17. H. 7. 1. And ſo he coucluded that the Judgment shall be given for the Plaintiff in the <hi>ſcire facias.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Warburton</hi> Juſtice conceived the contrary, that is, that the <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Warburton.</note> in the <hi>Scire facias</hi> ſhall be barred: And he agreed and ſaid, that none will deny but that Debts ſhall be paid, but that ought to be according to the rules of the Law: For by the Common Law the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Defendant</hi> was not lyable to <hi>execution,</hi> and then it is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine in what caſes he is at this day ſubject to <hi>execution:</hi> and though in Treſpaſſe <hi>Capias</hi> lyes at the Common Law, but in Debt no <hi>Capias</hi> lyes till the <hi>Statute</hi> of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. which gives the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe which was in Accompt, and this is as well in the Originall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:41383:294"/>
as in the Judiciall, and <hi>Elegit</hi> was firſt given by the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſt.</hi> 2. And this was of the half of the Land: But <hi>Levari facias</hi> was at the Common Law of the profits of the Land: That in debt <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance</hi> and <hi>Election</hi> binds the party, and ſo this remains; for the ſaid <hi>Statutes</hi> being in the affirmative, doth not take away that, nor abate it: and by that if Conuſee of a <hi>ſtatute</hi> accepts Land extended <note place="margin">Land extended at too high rate.</note> at too high a value, he is bound by that, 22 <hi>Edw. 3. 32. H. 6. 15 H.</hi> 7. And that when the Party hath Judgment, he hath <hi>election</hi> to have <hi>execution</hi> by <hi>Fieri facias, Elegit,</hi> or <hi>Capias,</hi> for he hath determined his Election. So if he makes his Election of a <hi>Capias</hi> at firſt, he cannot have <hi>Elegit</hi> after, 30 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. adjudged 32 <hi>Edw. 3. Proceſſe</hi> 52. according, <hi>Long</hi> 5 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. by <hi>Markeham</hi> and others, and the reaſon which is given in 47 <hi>Edw. 3. 17 Edw.</hi> 4. and 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. that have been remembred to the contrary is only, that it is reaſon that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> ſhould have the ſame <hi>proceſſ:</hi> which was at the Common Law, and there was not any ſuch <hi>proceſſe</hi> as <hi>Capias</hi> in debt at the Common Law, and 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. may be underſtood that the <hi>Elegit</hi> was not returned, and ſo no record of that. And 50 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. a man may recover in Debt, and pray <hi>Elegit,</hi> and after brings Debt upon the Record, but it doth not lye. And he agreed to the Book of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 6. For there the <hi>Defendant</hi> was bound in an Obligation to make ſatisfaction of Debt, and hee dyed in Priſon, and this cannot be ſatisfaction according to the Condition. And in the Caſe of <hi>Fitz. Nat. Brev.</hi> the ſame doubt of that, and this was the more ſtrong caſe then the caſe at the Barr: and if he doubted of that, is the cauſe that he doubts alſo. And cyted <hi>Williams</hi> and <hi>Cuttis</hi> caſe, <hi>Rot.</hi> 88. in the point, where the reaſon of the Judgment was for that, that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> had his plain and full ſatisfaction, and ſaith that it was apparent difference between that and <hi>Blunfields</hi> caſe, for there was 2 <hi>Defendants:</hi> and here if one dyes, there ſhall be no ſatisfaction, and ſo theſe reconciled. And ſo if a man be taken upon a <hi>Statute Merchant,</hi> and dyes in <hi>execution,</hi> that ſhall not be ſatisfaction, for this is ſpeciall <hi>proceſſe</hi> given by <hi>ſtatutes.</hi> And 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. If a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Execution eſcape, he ſhall not be taken againe: and in the 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7. in debt upon an Obligation <hi>Capias profine</hi> was awarded, and the <hi>Defendant</hi> taken by that. And the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> prayed that he might be in Execution for his debt alſo, and could not, for that he had ſued <hi>Fierifacias,</hi> and it doth not appear if the Sheriff have that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted or not. And ſo he concluded that the Judgment ſhould not be revived by the <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt the <hi>Executors,</hi> and that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be given for the <hi>Defendants</hi> in the <hi>Scire facias.</hi>

                     <p>And for the firſt, the fault was in <hi>Jackeſon,</hi> for he did not keep his day in the Condition, and upon this was ſued, then he pleaded a falſe plea, and upon that <hi>Judgement</hi> was given againſt him, in all which actions the default was in the <hi>Defendant,</hi> and no default in the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> for he took the Body which is the viſible <hi>execution,</hi> not in <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> but to <hi>ſatisfie,</hi> and the <hi>Defendants</hi> have not pleaded fully adminiſtred, but confeſſe that they have <hi>Aſſets,</hi> and there is more reaſon that the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> shall be ſatisfied, then the <hi>Executors</hi> keep the goods to their own uſe; for it is <hi>Summa Injuſtitia nocentem habere totum lucrum, &amp; innocentem totum damnum.</hi>

                     <p>Second reaſon was, that it is no ſatisfaction for the <hi>Defendant</hi> to dye in Priſon, and agreed that if 2 <hi>Precipes</hi> are contained in one O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall, there shall be but one <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi> But if one be taken by <hi>Capias,</hi> and remains in <hi>Execution, Capias</hi> shall be awarded againſt the other, and he shall remain in Priſon till <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> be had, for <hi>execution</hi> is no <hi>ſatisfaction,</hi> as it is ſaid in 29 H. 8. <hi>b.

                     <p>And to the third, that is, that the Debt remains after the taking of the body in <hi>execution,</hi> and agreed that when <hi>execution</hi> is made of goods or lands, no Debt remains, but otherwiſe it is of <hi>executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the Body, as it appears by 29 H. 8. before cyted, <hi>B.

Warburton</hi> Juſtice to the contrary, and yet he agreed that neither the Arbitrement, nor the conveyance, nor the private act, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes <note place="margin">Warburton.</note> the Commoners for theſe reaſons, which have been urged by <hi>Foſter;</hi> but he relyed only upon the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. and to that he ſayd that the <hi>ſtatute</hi> gives power to the owner of Ground to incloſe, and it ſhould be frivilous for him to incloſe, if the Commoner ſhal not be by that excluded, and he ſaid that the perſons mentioned in the <hi>ſtatute</hi> are two.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is the owner of the ground, and ſuch perſon he agreed Sir <hi>Francis Barrington</hi> is not.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is ſuch perſon to whom ſuch wood ſhal happen to be ſold, and ſuch Perſon it ſeems, is Sir <hi>Francis Barrington,</hi> and yet he agreed that he hath an Inheritance in the Trees, and the Owner of the ſoyl cannot cut them, nor dig the ſoyl from the Roots of the Trees, for then the Grant could not take effect, and he ſayd there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between ſales of Wood, though that the <hi>ſtatute</hi> ſpeaks of the Perſon to whom Wood ſhall be ſold, and another perſon to whom it ſhal be given without conſideration, and to that he reſembled the <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Weſtminſter 2.

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:41383:299"/>
He would firſt conſider how the Law was before the making of that, and as to that it appears by the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of <hi>Charta de foresta,</hi> that by the Common Law, no man which was Owner of Wood in which <note place="margin">Charta de Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſta.</note> another had Common; that they could not incloſe, but <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> of Common or action upon the caſe lyeth, as it requires, and if it be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Wood within the Kings Forreſt, in which none hath intereſt of Common, then may he incloſe by the view of the Forreſters, and this hold incloſed by the ſpace of three years, as it appears by the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble of the Statute of 22.

And then conſidered between what perſons the <hi>ſtatute</hi> is made: And to that he conceived it is made between the King and his Succeſſors of one part, and Subjects having woods growing upon their owne Grounds, and ſuch perſons unto whom ſuch woods ſhal happen to be ſold of the other part; and a Commoner is not named in the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> and alſo the Body of the <hi>ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> is not general, but there are ſome words in one ſentence, and this is but a ſentence and cannot be divided; the words are.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The ſayd Hedges ſo made, may keep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, And repaire and maintain them, as often as need ſhal be, within ſeven years.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, without ſuing any other Licenſe of him (that is the King) or his Heirs or other perſons (that is, which have forreſts or Chaſes) or any of their Officers, and here the ſentence concludes, and there is no period before them, ſo that this <hi>ſtatute</hi> being made between the King and owners of forreſts and Chaſes of one part, and Owners of woods in their own ſoyl, and other perſons to whom ſuch woods ſhould be ſold other part, this ſhall not extend to other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Commoners, and it is like to the caſe in 9 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 257. 13. A man makes a Leaſe for years, and covenants that the Leſſee shal injoy the Tearm without eviction of the Leſſor, or any claiming under him, if he be evicted by a ſtranger, this shal be no breaking of the Covenant, for a ſtranger is no party to the Deed, nor claims un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Leſſor, and for this his Entry shal not give Action to the Leſſee, and ſo is the Caſe in 21 H. 7. between the Prior of <hi>Caſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and the Dean of Saint <hi>Stephens,</hi> which was adjudged the 18 of H. 7. <hi>Paſch.

Though that no Judgment be reported, where it appears that the King <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. ſeiſed al the Lands of Priors aliens, in time of War, for that that they carried the Treaſure of the King out of the Realme to the Kings Enemies, and ſo it was made by H. 4. alſo during the time of his Reign, and then in the ſecond year of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:41383:299"/>
the Reign of King H. 5. by a <hi>ſtatute</hi> made between the King, and the ſayd Priors aliens, al the Poſſeſſions of the ſayd Priors were reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into the hands of the ſayd King, and adjudged in 21. H. 7. 1. before that this shal not extend to the Prior of <hi>Caſtleton,</hi> which had Annuities iſſuing out of the Poſſeſſions of the ſayd Priors, for the ſaid Prior of <hi>Caſtleton</hi> was not party to the ſayd act of Parliament, and for that he shal not be prejudiced by that, and ſo it was adjudged, 25. and 26. <hi>Eliz.</hi> In the Court of VVards in the caſe of one <hi>Boſwell,</hi> where the King made a Leaſe for years which was voydable, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by another Patent granted the Inheritance, and then came the <hi>ſtatute</hi> of 18. <hi>Eliz.</hi> to confirm al Patents made by the ſayd Queen within her time, and adjudged that the ſayd Act shal not make the ſayd patent voyd to the Patentee, which is a ſtranger to the act of the Parliament, but only againſt the Queen, her Heirs and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, for by the <hi>statute</hi> it is made only againſt one perſon only, and shal not be good againſt another, though there be no ſaving of ſuch perſon in the ſayd Act. And alſo he conceived that the ſtatute of 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. Doth not extend to any woods in forreſt, in which another hath Common, for it doth not extend only to ſuch woods which a common perſon hath in the Kings forreſt, or common perſon, and that it may be incloſed for the ſpace of three years after the cutting of the wood in this, before the making of the ſayd <hi>ſtatute,</hi> and this was no wood in which an Eſtranger had Common, as it appears by the <hi>Preamble</hi> of the ſayd <hi>ſtatute;</hi> and then after in the ſayd <hi>ſtatute</hi> it is ſayd, ſuch woods may be incloſed.</p>
                     <p>And alſo he conceived where the <hi>ſtatute</hi> ſayth, that they may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the ſame Grounds, with ſuch ſufficient hedges, able to keep out all manner of Beaſts and Cattell out of the ſame Grounds, but this refers to the quality of the hedge, for before it ought to be a ſmall Ditch, and by this <hi>ſtatute</hi> it ought to be with ſuch hedg which ſhall be able, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it shall not be referred to the manner of the Cattell: But for the difference between Beaſts of Forreſt, Beaſts of Chaſe, and Beaſts of Warrain, ſee the Regiſter, <hi>fol. 96. 43 Ed.</hi> 3. 13. 12. H. 8. 12. <hi>b. Hollinsheads Cronicle, fol. 20. b.</hi> 32. And he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that Sir <hi>Francis Barrington</hi> is ſuch a Vendee of Wood, that is within the <hi>ſtatute,</hi> though that he be Vendee of Inheritance, and hath a greater Eſtate then <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nica vice,</hi> but for that, that he concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that it was not within the <hi>ſtatute</hi> for other reaſons before cyted, he would not diſpute it: But he conceived if this had been the queſtion of the Caſe, that this was within the ſtatute, and alſo he conceived that this was a generall <hi>ſtatute,</hi> of which the Judges ſhall take notice without pleading of this; And this reaſon was, for that that the King was party to it, and this which concernes the King, being the head, concernes all the Body and Common Wealth,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:41383:300"/>
and ſo it was adjudged in the Chancery in the caſe of Serjeant <hi>Heale,</hi> that the ſtatute by which the Prince is created Prince of <hi>VVales</hi> was a general <hi>ſtatute,</hi> and for that ſee the Lord <hi>Barkleyes</hi> caſe in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries:</hi> Alſo he conceived, that the ſaid <hi>ſtatute</hi> of 22 of <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. was repealed by 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. for this was in the Negative, that none ſhal cut any wood, but only in ſuch manner as is preſcribed by the ſaid <hi>ſtatute,</hi> and for that ſhal be a repeale of the firſt, and that by the firſt Branch of the ſayd <hi>statute</hi> it appeares, that if ſuch giving of Wood in his own Soyl within any forreſt, he cut to his own uſe, he cannot incloſe, and by that Branch Commoner is not excluded, but by the ſecond Branch it is provided, that he may incloſe the fourth part of his Wood, and cut that in ſuch manner as is appointed by the ſaid <hi>ſtatute,</hi> and then he ſhal looſe his own Common, in the three other parts, and ſo he concluded that Judgment ought to be given for the Plaintiff, which is the Commoner, and Judgment was entred accordingly.</p>

                        <hi>Letters Patents,</hi> granted to the ſayd Earl, the Office of <hi>Steward<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of diverſe Mannors, <hi>Habendum &amp; exercendum, cum omnibus fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odis, vadis &amp; proficuijs eidem Officio pertinentibus,</hi> to the ſayd Earl, from the time that he ſhould be of ful age, during his Life, and further the ſayd <hi>Queen</hi> granted to the ſayd Earle the Office of <hi>Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-ſhip of</hi> divers Parks and forreſts, <hi>Habendum &amp; exercendum Officium predictum cum omnibus &amp; ſingulis ſuis proficuijs, vadis, feodis, &amp; emolumentis, quibuſcunque, eidem Officio pertinentibus, aut ratione ejuſdem percipiendis per ſe vel ſufficiendem deputatum ſunm,</hi> &amp;c. And after in the ſayd Patent it is recyted, that the ſayd Earl was of ful age <hi>An</hi> &amp; 40 <hi>Eliz. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t informamu, r mandamus quod omnes &amp; ſinguli Officiarij, &amp; alij quicunque ſint intendentes &amp; obedientes dicto Commiti, &amp; deputatis ſuis, in exerendo officium predictum,</hi> and if this patent were good or not was the queſtion.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Hutton</hi> ſerjeant conceived, that the Patent was good, and that the ſayd Earl may exerciſe the ſayd Office of <hi>Stewardſhip,</hi> for which this Action was brought, by Deputy by force of the ſayd Grant.</p>
                     <p>The firſt queſtion, which hee moved was, if Steward of a Court may execiſe his Office by Deputy, without ſpeciall Grant of that.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if there be words within the Patent, to enable him to execute that by Deputy.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if upon this diſturbance, action upon the caſe, <hi>Quare vi &amp; armis,</hi> lies.</p>
                     <p>And to the firſt, he conceived, that the <hi>Patentee</hi> may exerciſe the Office by Deputy without ſpecial words of Deputation in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, for he conceived that it is not meerly an Office of truſt, for he hath not the keeping of any Records, for the Courts of which he was ſteward were not Courts of Record, and yet that all the Books are, that ancient grants of Office of ſtewardſhip, contain that the Patentee may exreciſe, <hi>Per ſe, vel per ſufficientem deputatum ſuum,</hi> though they are not of Courts in which the ſteward is Judge, but the ſuitors, but if a Grant be of ſuch an Office of Inheritance, then there needs words of <hi>Deputatum,</hi> for here it is apparent, that there was not ſpecial truſt repoſed in the Patentee: And he alſo agreed, that if it be not an Office of profit, the Grantor may enter and out the <hi>Patentee,</hi> but the <hi>fee</hi> ſhal remain, as it appears by the 31 H. 8. <hi>Brookes Novell Caſe</hi> and 18 <hi>Ed,</hi> 4. And it was not the intent of the <hi>Queen,</hi> that the Earl of <hi>Rutland</hi> ſhould execute the Office in perſon, for that ſhould be an undervaluing of him, the which he ſayd was proved by <hi>Sir Robert VVrothes Caſe in the Commentaries,</hi> where an Officer to the Prince was diſcharged of his attendance, by
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:41383:302"/>
alteration of quality of the Prince, and making of him King, and yet the Fee remained.</p>
                     <p>And to the ſecond it ſeems, that the patent hath expreſſe words of Deputation.</p>
                     <p>And the third Grant, which hath a reference to the Grant prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and al the words being put together make a perfect Grant, and this ſuch conſtruction hath been alwaies made of Grants of the King, as it appears by <hi>Sir John Mullyns Caſe, 6 Coke</hi> 56. And <hi>Juſtice VVind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams caſe 5 Coke 7. a.</hi> So if the King makes a Leaſe of a Mannor, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a Grove next to the Mannor, this ſhal be intended next to the Mannor Houſe, for otherwiſe it ſhal be out of the Mannor, and ſo the exeption voyde, but <hi>Coke and Foſter</hi> doubted of that.</p>
                     <p>And to the third point, that the Action was maintainable, <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> for when the Deputy of the Earl, of <hi>Rutland</hi> proclaimed the Court as Deputy of the Earle of <hi>Rutland,</hi> and theſe <hi>Defendants</hi> proclaimed that as ſtewards of the Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed that; and after held all the Courts and received the profits, it ſeemed to him, that for this outing and diſturbance which is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſin, action upon the caſe lies, <hi>Quare vi &amp; armis,</hi> as wel as in the Book of Entries 15. two men had Warrens adjoyning, and one of them puts Cats, and other vermine into the Warren of the other to deſtroy it, and the Action of <hi>treſpaſſe, Vi et armis</hi> lyes, and ſo for menace action of treſpas, <hi>Vi &amp; armis</hi> lies, as it appears by 3 H. 4. and this diſturbance is ſufficient to maintain an <hi>Aſſiſe,</hi> and upon that he concluded that the <hi>Plaintiff in the Action</hi> ought to recover, and to have Judgment.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Harris</hi> the younger Serjeant argued, that the Grant is not good, for default of certainty, as to this Grant of Stewarſhip, for the Grant is of the Office of Stewardſhip of the Mannor of <hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feild,</hi> and doth not ſhew where the Mannor is, nor in what Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and it appears, and is put for a Rule by <hi>Huſſey</hi> cheife Juſtice, in the 25. of <hi>H. 7. 60. b.</hi> That when a man wil have advantage of Letters Patents of the King, it behooveth that they extend certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to things of which he wil have advantage, ſee 2. <hi>R. 3. 7. a. By Huſſey 44. Ed. 3. 17. 5 Ed. 4. Garters Caſe, 17 Ed.</hi> 3. 15. and <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingtons Caſe, which is Hill, and Pext, 2 Coke 1. 31. b.</hi> If the Town be miſnamed it is good, if there be another certainty, but if it be not named at all, otherwiſe it is. And to the Point moved by <hi>Hutton,</hi> he concived that this Office of Stewardſhip could not be exerciſed by a Deputy, as it appears by <hi>Littleton in his Chapter of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates</hi> upon condition, where he ſaith, that there are Eſtates upon condition in Law, of which Stewardſhip is one, <hi>fol. 89. Sect.</hi> 379. That cannot make Deputy without ſpeciall Grants, and with this
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:41383:302"/>
agreed <hi>Sir Henry Nevills Caſe Com.</hi> 379. and <hi>Long 5. Ed. 4. 26. b.</hi> and by 21 <hi>E. 4. 20. and Sir Henry Nevills Caſe</hi> before, he could not grant over his office, but if he do not attend to the Execution of that, it is forfeiture, 11 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. ſo if he wants skill 29 H. 6. 42. <hi>Per totam curiam,</hi> He conceived that the Law doth not make any difference, between the perſon of an Earl and another, to the executing of this Office, and that the words of the Patent do not contain words of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, for in the Grant the words are, <hi>Habendum Officium predictum,</hi> breifly written, <hi>Cum omnibus vadis &amp; feodis eidem Officio, ſue ratione ejuſdem,</hi> &amp;c. The which laſt words are expoſitory of the firſt, that is, that it ſhal be intended that the Office is contained in the laſt Grant, and ſhal not be referred to a Grant precedent, in which the Stewardſhip is contained, and alſo he conceived that this Action upon the caſe doth not ly, <hi>Quare vi &amp; armis,</hi> as it appears by <hi>Fitzherberts Naturabrevium 86. H.</hi> Where it is ſayd, that in treſpaſs upon the caſe, theſe words, <hi>Vi &amp; armis</hi> are contained in the Writ, ſhal be ſufficient cauſe to abate the Writ, ſee 11 <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> 25. He which councels to make Diſſeiſin, ſhal not be a Diſſeiſor with force, for he ought to do ſome manual Act, either to the perſon or to the poſſeſſion, ſee 41 <hi>Ed. 4. 24. a.</hi> and 44. <hi>Ed. 3. 20. b.</hi> And ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that this Action is not maintainable, and that Judgment ought to be given for the Defendant for the cauſes aforeſayd.</p>
                     <p>This Caſe was argued again by <hi>Nicholls Serjeant for the Plaintiff,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Nicholls.</note> 
                        <hi>and by Dodridge the Kings Serjeant for the Defendants,</hi> to the ſame intent, and it was urged by <hi>Dodridge,</hi> that the Patent containes three ſeveral expreſſe Grants, which are diſtinct Grants in themſelves, as there be three diſtinct ſeverall Patents, though they have but one Parchment and one Seale, and if the King grant the Office of parkſhip of two parks by one ſelf ſame Grant, if the Patentee be diſſeiſed of them, he may have ſeveral <hi>Aſſiſes,</hi> though that it be but one ſelf-ſame grant. And he agreed that the words, <hi>officium predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> in the 3. grant ſhall be intended <hi>officium predictum,</hi> and ſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect in the ſecond grant, if it were not limitation of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate in the ſecond grant, but for that, that the ſecond grant was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in it ſelf, there need not of neceſſity any ſuch conſtruction, and that theſe words ſhall be referred to the laſt words, appeares by the laſt words of the <hi>habendum,</hi> that is, <hi>cum vadis &amp; feodis, eidem officio, aut ratione ejuſdem officij,</hi> and theſe Relatives are expoſition accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. And to the objection of the clauſe of Aſſiſtance in the end of the <hi>Patent:</hi> he anſwered that if the grant were ill and void in it ſelf, this Clauſe doth not ſupply that. For this is but notification to the Officers of the Queen, that they ſhould be attendant to the ſaid Earl. For though that the Intent of the Queen was, that the Earl of <hi>hutland</hi> should execute this office by Deputy, yet this intent shall
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:41383:303"/>
not make the grant good, for though that the Intent of a common perſon be apparent within the Deed, yet this intent ſhall not make a voyd grant good, 19 H. 6. 20 H. 6. 22 H. 6. 15. Grant to 2. <hi>Et heredibus,</hi> with warranty to them and to their Heirs, this clauſe of warranty, though it were the intent of the parties apparent, yet it was not ſufficient to make the grant which was voyd good, and ſo it is in 9 H. 6. 35. Abbot by his deed in the firſt perſon grants a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement, and the Grantee in the third perſon, <hi>renunciavit totum Commune quod habuit in uno tenemento:</hi> and though that in this Grant the Intent of the parties is apparent, yet this Intent ſhall not make the Grant which is void in it ſelf to be good. So if a man makes a Leaſe for life to the Husband and Wife, and after grants the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Land that the Husband held for tearm of life, that grant of the Reverſion is void, though that the Intent was apparent, 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>Edw. 3. Grants</hi> 63. And ſo in Patent of the King, grant to a man, and <hi>heredebus maſculis ſuis,</hi> is void, though that the Intent alſo is apparent, that he ſhould have an eſtate tayle, 18 H. 8. <hi>b. Eſtates</hi> 84 But admitting that the Grant may be ſupplyed by the laſt words, that is, that in the laſt Grant the words are <hi>officia predicta,</hi> and in the clauſe of Aſſiſtance, yet theſe words may be ſupplyed, for there are two other Grants, in which there is expreſſe mention that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentee</hi> may exerciſe it by Deputy: and ſo the words ſhall have full In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, <hi>Reddendo ſingula ſingulis.</hi> And hee conceived that the Writ ſhall abate for that, that it contains <hi>Vi &amp; armis.</hi> And alſo the Declaration; for the Jury have not found any diſturbance at all. And he agreed that in ſome caſes, Treſpaſſe <hi>Vi &amp; armis</hi> well lyes, as it is <hi>Fitzh. Na. Bre.</hi> 92. 86. as where it is actuall taking, 45 <hi>Ed. 3. 30. 44 Edw.</hi> 3. 20. where treſpaſſe <hi>Vi &amp; armis</hi> is maintainable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Miller for taking of Toll againſt the Cuſtome, for here is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall taking, and 8 R. 2. 7. Hoſteler 7. In an action of Treſpaſſe, <hi>Vi &amp; armis</hi> againſt an Hoſt, for that, that certain evill perſons have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the money of the <hi>Plaintiff,</hi> and good. But where there is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny actuall taking, there the Writ ought not to containe <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> for, for not ſcowring of a Ditch, or ſtopping of Water, as it is 43 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 17. But for caſting of Dung into a River, action of Treſpaſſe <hi>Vi &amp; armis</hi> lyes, 12 H. 4. But for burning of a houſe it doth not lye <hi>Vi &amp; armis, 48 Ed.</hi> 3. 25. And ſo for turning of water-courſe, 3 H. 4. 5. But in this caſe there is but diſturbance with a word, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to hold a Court, and no Court held, nor no Proclamation made, and ſo no diſturbance at all; 16 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. 11. one hath the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Parkerſhip, and another man was bound, that he ſhould not diſturbe. And in debt upon the Obligation he pleaded that the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligor hath threatned to diſturb him, and adjudged that this is no breaking of the Condition, for there is no diſturbance: and in 2 <hi>Ed.</hi>
                        <pb n="335" facs="tcp:41383:303"/>
3. 25. and 40. <hi>Quo minus</hi> by <hi>Jeffery Scorlage,</hi> where the King grants to the Mayor of <hi>Southampton</hi> the Cuſtomes of the ſame Towne, and in <hi>quo minus</hi> for taking of them, it was adjudged that words are no aſſault, but there ought to be an act done. But in this Caſe is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing found but words, and no act done, but it is found that after the <hi>Defendants</hi> held the Courts. But that doth not appear if it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the will of the Earl of Rutland or not, and ſo concludes that the action is not mayntainable. And this caſe was argued again in Trinity Tearm next enſuing by the Juſtices, <hi>Danyel</hi> being dead, but I was not preſent at the argument of <hi>Foſter</hi> and <hi>Warburton</hi> Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but I heard the arguments of <hi>Walmſley</hi> Juſtice, and <hi>Coke</hi> chiefe Juſtice.</p>
                     <p>And firſt <hi>Walmeſley</hi> conceived that the Grant was good, and that <note place="margin">Walmeſley.</note> the Earl of Rutland by this Grant might exerciſe his Office by Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and this only in reſpect of the quality of his perſon, for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentee is a Noble man, which hath been employed as an Embaſſador of the King into other Realms, and this Grant of this Office being amongſt others, varies from them; for this wants the word, <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendum,</hi> which is contained in the others: and alſo the office of a Steward is too baſe for an Earl to execute, for the Steward is but as a Clark, and not a Judge, for he ſhall not be named in a Writ of falſe Judgment, nor ſhall hold plea of any actions but under 40. s. &amp; for that it is not fit nor convenient that an Earl ſhould exerciſe ſuch a baſ Office in Perſon. For if Recovery here be pleaded, it ſhall be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Country, 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. And the Steward ſhall not give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the Suitors, and no tryall ſhal be by Verdict, but by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Law, and the fee of the Stewardis but a 1 d. for every Plaint. And for that it was not the Intent of the Queen that the Earl ſhould exerciſe ſuch a baſe office in perſon, and her Intent is apparent, for that, that the word Exerciſe is not contained in the Patent. And the Intent of the Queen is to be conſidered, for the other Offices are fit to be executed by the Earl: for the exerciſing of them is but a matter of pleaſure, as in hunting in the Forreſts and Parks of the Queen: and for that if theſe Grants have not contained words of deputation, the Earl ought to exerciſe them in perſon, according to <hi>Littleton.</hi> And Noble men are not to be uſed as common people, for they are not to be Impannelled of a Jury, and <hi>Capias</hi> doth not lye againſt him, by which he cannot be outlawed, and for that he ſhall not be bound to ſit in ſuch a baſe Court, as this baſe Court is: And all this matter is wel declared and expounded in the laſt clauſe of the Patent, where the words are, <hi>Et ulterius volumus &amp; mandamus quod omnes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Sint intendentes &amp; auxiliantes,</hi> &amp;c. Where the words <hi>volumus</hi> in Patents of the King, to amount to as much as <hi>concedimus,</hi> or a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, which is all one with a Grant, as in 32 <hi>H.</hi> 6. The King relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:41383:304"/>
all his right in an Advowſon, <hi>Nolentes,</hi> that the Patentee ſhall be grieved or diſturbed, and adjudged that this ſhall amount to a Grant, and ſo the word <hi>Volumus,</hi> in the principall caſe: and alſo he conceived that the action is well maintainable, <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> as <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Impedit,</hi> for diſturbance by word, or preſentment by word. And it is alſo found that the <hi>Defendants</hi> did take all the profits, and that the Deputy of the <hi>Plaintiff</hi> came to the uſual place where the Court was kept, and that could not be intended to be out of the Mannor. And ſo for theſe reaſons he concluded that Judgement ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the <hi>Plaintiff.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And <hi>Coke</hi> cheife Juſtice argued to the ſame intent, that is, that the <note place="margin">Coke.</note> 
                        <hi>Plaintiff</hi> ought to have Judgment. And firſt he conceived, that the Patent is good, notwithſtanding the uncertainty, that the Mannors are not named in what Counties they are, either in <hi>England, France,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> for the Mannor is named very certain, by which it may be granted though it be in the Kings caſe, as it appears by 32 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 20. where the King grants all Mannors, Meſſuages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the poſſeſſions of <hi>I. S.</hi> attaint, and good. And ſuch grant was made to <hi>Charles Brandon</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and adjudged good, though that the perſon of a man is more incertain then the Mannor, &amp; yet, <hi>Id certum eſt quod certum reddi poteſt.</hi> And 39 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 1. in the Abbot of <hi>Reddings</hi> caſe, where a grant was made to the Abbot and his Succeſſors, that the Prior and Covent ſhall take the profits in time of vacation, <hi>Fitz. Na. Bre. 33. b.</hi> And 23 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 20. The King grants to the Queen the Barrony, and all Mannors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gaunt</hi> be able to govern himſelfe, and that ſhall be intended till the Law intends him able to govern himſelf, and Mannor is very certain, of which a view ſhall be awarded. The ſecond exception which was taken to the grant was, for that, that it was to take effect at the ful age of the Earl. And after it is recyted in the <hi>Patent,</hi> that he was of full age before the making of the <hi>Patent,</hi> and ſo by conſequence the <hi>Patent</hi> is to take effect from the time that it was paſt: And to that he ſaid, that it ſhall be intended to the profits of the Office only, for it appeares by the Patent that the Queene had granted it to another during his Minority: That is, the office.</p>
                     <p>And to the third mattter, That is, if hee cannot make a Deputy, then he hath forfeited the ſaid Office, by the not uſing of it. And to that he ſaid, it appeares by <hi>Waltons</hi> caſe, 10 <hi>Eliz. Dyer,</hi> fol. 270. That if a man grants a Fee, <hi>pro concilio impendendo,</hi> or keeping of Courts, the Fee shall not be forfeited without ſpeciall requeſt to the <note place="margin">Fee when for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited.</note> Patentee to give Councell, or to hold his Courts, for hee doth not know if the Grantor will have his Courts held or not: and ſo it is 39 <hi>H. 6. 22. Brewens</hi> caſe, where it is alſo agreed, that it shall be no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of an office without ſpeciall requeſt to hold the Courts, or
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:41383:304"/>
to give Councell: But in the caſe of the Queen otherwiſe it is, for ſhe ought not to make demand in caſe of Rent nor Condition, though that it be within the <hi>Statute of 32. H.</hi> 8. And yet it was argued in Sir <hi>Thomas Hennages</hi> caſe, that if the King make a Leaſe for years upon condition to ceaſe; this shall ceaſe without office upon the breaking of the Condition, but a Leaſe for life shall not ceaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out office, though that the Condition be broken: And ſo if the King grants an Office for life, this shall not be avoided without Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: And he doubted the caſe of the Leaſe for yeares: And alſo he agreed, that the Grantee of a Stewardship, cannot make Deputy to exerciſe his Office, without ſpeciall words in the Patent: But if the Office be granted to him and his Heires, or to him and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, it is ſuf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>cient without other words to make a Deputy: And alſo he ſayd that the word Steward, is the name of an Office, and is derived of Steed and Ward, which are Saxon words, and intend the Keeper of the place, which the party himſelfe ought to hold; and it appeares by <hi>Cambdem and Lambert:</hi> And ſo the word <hi>Seneſcalls</hi> alſo ſignify, for this is but a <hi>Cuſtos ſive officiarius loci:</hi> See <hi>Fleta liber</hi> 2. chap. 72. <hi>Seneſcallum providebit Dominus circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectum fidelem, Modeſtum &amp; pacificum qui in conſuitudinibus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>&amp; Jura Domini ſui teneri,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Quique balivos ſuos inſtruere poteſt, Cujus officium eſt curia maneriorum,</hi> &amp;c. And a Deputy is a perſon authoriſed by the Officer in the name and right of the Officer, and for all that he doth the Officer ſhall anſwer, for he is but as a ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Officer: But aſſignee is in his own right, and he ſhall anſwer for himſelfe, and forfeiture by aſſignee of Tenant for life, ſhall not be forfeiture of the reverſion, 39. <hi>H.</hi> 6. And he agreed that a Marſhall, Steward, Conſtable, Bayliff, and ſuch like cannot make Deputies, without ſpeciall wordes in the Grant, as it appeares, 39. <hi>H. 6. 11. Ed. 3. 10. Ed. 4. 14. 17. and 7. 21. Ed. 4. Nevills</hi> caſe <hi>in the Com. and Littleton:</hi> And to the exceptions which have been taken to the Writ and Count, he ſaith that an Action of Treſpaſſe, which is founded upon the caſe, doth not lye, <hi>Vi et armis,</hi> where the point and cauſe is Action, is ſuppoſed to be made <hi>Vi et armis,</hi> and for that he takes difference between. <hi>Cauſa cauſans,</hi> and <hi>Cauſa cauſata,</hi> for where the matter which is ſuppoſed to be done <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> is not the point of the Action: But the cauſe of the Action there lies very well <hi>Vi &amp; armis:</hi> But wherein the point of Action is ſuppoſed to be made <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> there the Writ ſhall abate: As if a man brings an Action of Treſpaſſe for caſting dung into a River, <note place="margin">Treſpaſs.</note> by which his Land is drowned, in this caſe an Action of Treſpaſſe upon the caſe, <hi>Vi &amp; armis</hi> lyeth very well, for here the caſting in of the Dung, is but <hi>Cauſa cauſans,</hi> And the drowning of the Land is <hi>Cauſa cauſata, 8.

<pb n="338" facs="tcp:41383:305"/>

And for that he conceived that the Grant is good; And that the ſayd Earl may exerciſe this Office by a Deputy, as well as if a Common perſon grant an Office of Foſterſhip to the King, he may exerciſe that by any party, or grant it over, though therebe no words of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the Grant, and this in reſpect of the quality of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and in many other caſes an Earle or another Noble man ſhall be priviledged, as in 3 <hi>H.</hi> 6.
