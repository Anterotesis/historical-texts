         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The cauſe and reaſon.</head>
               <p>Firſt, foraſmuch as our Country is (for the moſt
part) compaſſed with the Seas, &amp; the greateſt force
for defence under God, is the Kings Majeſties Navy
of Ships, for maintenance and increaſe of the ſaid
Navy, this Law for abſtinence hath been moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ordained, that by the certaine expence of fiſh,
fiſhing and fiſher-men might be the more increaſed
and the better maintained, for that the ſaid Trade is
the chiefeſt Nurſe, not onely for the bringing up of
youth for Shipping, but great numbers of Shippes
therein are uſed, furniſhed with ſufficient Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
men at all times in readineſſe for his Majeſties
ſervice in thoſe affaires.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe, for that many Townes and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages
upon the Sea coaſts grow of late wonderfully
decayed, and ſome wonderfully depopulated, which
in times paſt were repleniſhed; not only with fiſher
men and great ſtore of ſhipping, but ſundry other
Artificers, as Shipwrights, Smiths, Rope-makers,
Nett-makers, Saile-makers, Weavers, Dreſſers,
Carriers, and Utterers of Fiſh, maintained chiefly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63857:3"/>
by fiſhing, that they hereby againe might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
the want thereof is, and hath beene cauſe of
great numbers of idle perſons, with whom this
Realme at this time is greatly damaged: and this
happeneth by reaſon of the uncertainty of the ſale
of fiſh, and the contempt which in eating of fiſh is
conceived.</p>
               <p>Furthermore it is conſidered, that the Trade for
graſing of cattell, through the exceſſive expence of
fleſh, is ſo much increaſed, that many Farme-houſes
and Villages, wherein were maintained great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of people, and by them the Markets plentifully
ſerved with corne and other victuals, is now utterly
decayed, and put downe for the feeding and graſing
of Beefes and Muttons onely, by means whereof the
people which in ſuch places were maintained, are
not only made vagrant, but alſo Calves, Hogs, Pigs,
Geefe, Hens, Chickens, Capons, Egges, Butter,
Cheeſe, and the like things, doe become exceeding
ſcarce and deare, by want of their increaſe in thoſe
places, ſo that the Markets are not, nor cannot be
ſerved, as in times paſt it hath beene.</p>
               <p>Many other things for confirmation hereof might
be ſpoken, as the great number of Ships decayed,
which hath been maintained by fiſhing; the wealth
and commodity that fiſhing bringeth to this Realm;
the cauſe that certaine dayes and times for expence
of fiſh, muſt of neceſſity be obſerved, grown by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the proviſion of fleſh for the peoples diet muſt
be certainely provided, whereof the gentle Reader
ſhall bee more at large inſtructed in a little booke,
publiſhed to that effect; with ſundry other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63857:4"/>
which for brevitie is omitted, in hope the
conſideration hereof will be ſufficient to perſwade
ſuch perſons as eſteeme more the benefit of the
Countrey then their owne luſt or appetite; ſetting
before their eyes the feare of God, in obedience to
the Kings Commandement, eſpecially in ſuch
things as concerne the benefit of a Commonwealth;
conſidering S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, There is no Power but of
God: The Powers (ſayth he) that be, are ordained
of God; and thoſe that reſiſt theſe Powers, reſiſt the
Ordinance of God.</p>
               <p>It is further to be conſidered, that there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
to be made in the kind or nature of the meat
being Fleſh or Fiſh, as in times paſt a famed Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
therein was uſed, neyther is the meat concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it ſelfe unlawfull to be eaten at any time, but
the uſe thereof unlawfull, being forbidden to eate
by the Prince, having power and authoritie from
God, and done by the conſent of the Parliament:
For a Common-wealth, wherein obedience ought
to be ſhewed, not for feare of puniſhment onely, as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth, but for conſcience ſake; not eſteeming
the meat, nor the day, but obedience to the Law, and
benefit to our Countrey and poore Brethren; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring,
that the Magiſtrate beareth not the
Sword for nought, but to take vengeance upon them
that doe evill: For S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayth further, Hee that
will live without feare of puniſhment, muſt doe
well, and ſo ſhall he have prayſe for the ſame.</p>
               <p>And although feare of puniſhment will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
ſuch perſons as by affection continued hath
beene addicted from the expence of Fiſh, and the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63857:4"/>
obſervation of Fiſh-dayes; yet the foreſaid things
conſidered, let obedience to their Prince, and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to their Countrey, perſwade them to bridle their
affectioned luſt for a ſmall time, ſo ſhall they both
ſee and feele the great benefits thereby growing, and
eſcape the puniſhment for the offence appointed.
And for that the commodities may in ſome part
more plainely appeare, hereafter followeth an Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of the Beeves that were killed and uttered in
the Citie of <hi>London</hi> and Suburbs for a yeare, and
what number of them might be ſpared in the ſaid
yeare by one dayes abſtinence in a weeke; by which
alſo may be conjectured, what may be ſpared in this
whole Realme.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>An Eſtimate what Beeves might be
ſpared in a yeare, in the Citie of <hi>London,</hi>
by one dayes abſtinence in a weeke; Collected
out of ſeverall Statutes in the Reigne
of Queene <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FIrſt, in the yeare are 52 weekes, for every weeke
ſeven dayes, in all 365. The Lent, with Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
and Saterday in every weeke, and the other
accuſtomed Fiſh-dayes, being collected together,
extends to 153. So, in the yeare is 153 Fiſh-dayes,
and 212 Fleſh-dayes, that is, 59 Fleſh-dayes more
then Fiſh.</p>
               <p>So the yeare being 52 weekes, abate ſeven for the
time of Lent, wherein no Beeves ought to be killed,
and there remaineth but 45 weekes. Then let us ſay,
there be 60 Butchers that be Free-men within the
Citie, and every Butcher to kill weekely the one
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63857:5"/>
with the other five Beeves a peece; that ſame amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to 13500 Beeves.</p>
               <p>The Forrainers in the Suburbs, and ſuch as come
out of the Countrey to ſerve the Markets in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as it is credibly affirmed, kill and utter in the
Citie weekely four times ſo many as the Free-men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which amounteth to 54000. So joyning the Beeves
uttered by the Free-men and Farriners together,
they extend to 67500.</p>
               <p>If wee will now know, what number of Beefes
might be ſpared in a yeare, by one dayes abſtinence
in a weeke; let us ſay, in the weeke are five dayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomably
ſerved with Fleſh, (for that Friday and
Saterday by the Law are dayes of abſtinence) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
one being taken away, the reſt but foure; in like
caſe, divide the ſaid 67500 into five parts, and the
fifth part ſpared by the fifth dayes abſtinence, is
13500.</p>
               <p>By this is not meant, that any more Fiſh-dayes
ſhould be ordained then already are, but that Friday
and Saterday might be in better ſort obſerved, for
that Fleſh Victuals on thoſe dayes, in moſt places,
are as commonly ſpent as on Fleſh-dayes, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may well be accounted for the expence of one
Fleſh-day; the due obſervation whereof would ſpare
the number of Beeves aforeſaid, or more, beſides
thoſe things ſold by the Poulterers, and other ſmall
Cattell, as Calves, Sheepe, and Lambs innumerable
killed by the Butchers.</p>
