            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Here ſend you my Reaſons for my difuſing and declining the Game of Cheſs. This I premiſe, that I think Recreation to be in it ſelf Lawful, yea that like Phyſick it is to ſome perſons, and in ſome caſes very needfull: Alſo that this Game of Cheſs is not only Lawful, but it may be the moſt ingenious and delightful that ever was invented: Others ſeem to be calculated for Children, this for Men; in moſt others there's much of Contingency, in this there's nothing but Art. But though it be never ſo lawful and eligible in it ſelf, yet to me it is inexpedient. And there are ſome particular Reaſons why I am fallen out with this Exerciſe, and I believe ſhall never be reconciled to it again; and they are ſuch as follow.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It is a great Time-waſter: How many precious hours (which can never be recall'd) have I profuſely ſpent in this Game? O Cheſſe, I'le be aveng'd of thee for the loſs of my Time. 'Tis a true ſaying, That it is more neceſſary thriftineſs to be ſparing and ſaving of Time than of Money. One offered on his Death-bed a World of Wealth, for an Inch of Time; and another with great earneſtneſs, cryed out, when ſhe lay a dying; <hi>Call Time again! call time again!</hi> This I heard, ſays a worthy Miniſter, and I think the ſound of it will be in my ears ſo long as I live.</item>
               <item>2. It hath had with me a faſcinating property: I have been bewitcht by it; when I have begun, I have not had the power to give over. Though a thing be never ſo lawfull yet I ought not to ſuffer my ſelf to be brought under the power of it. I'le not uſe it, till I find I can refuſe it. Reaſon and Religion ſhall order my Recreation.</item>
               <item>3. It hath not done with me when I have done with it. It hath followed me into my Study, into my Pulpit; when I have been Praying, or Preaching, I have (in my thoughts) been playing at Cheſs; then I have had as it were a Cheſs-board before my eyes; then I have been thinking how I might have obtained the ſtratagems of my Antagoniſt, or make ſuch and ſuch motions to his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage; nay, I have heard of one who was playing at Cheſs in his thoughts (as appear'd by his words) when he lay a dying.</item>
               <item>4. It hath caus'd me to break many ſolemn Relſolutions, nay Vows and promiſes. Sometimes I have oblig'd my ſelf in the moſt ſolemn manner, to play but ſo many Mates at a time, or with any one perſon, and anon I have broken theſe obligations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and after Vows of that kind I have made inquiry how I might evade them; and have ſinfully prevaricated in that matter; and that not once only, but often.</item>
               <item>5. It hath wounded my Conſcience, and broken my peace. I have had ſad reflections upon it when I have been moſt ſerious. I find if I were now to dye, the remembrance of this Game would greatly trouble me, and ſtare me in the face. I have read in the life of the famous <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> how he was greatly troubled for his uſing of this Game, a little before his death.</item>
               <item>6. My uſing of it hath been ſcandalous and offenſive to others. Some Godly Friends (as I have underſtood) have been grieved by it; and others (as I have reaſon to fear) have been hardned by it. Great inconveniencies have ariſen from the places where, and the perſons with whom I have us'd this Game.</item>
               <item>7. My uſing of it hath occaſioned much ſin, as paſſion, ſtrife, idle (if not lying) words, in myſelf or my Antagoniſt, or both. It hath cauſed the neglect of many duties both to God and Man.</item>
               <item>8. My uſing of it doth evince, I have little ſelf denial in me. If I can't deny my ſelf in a fooliſh Game, how can I think I either do or ſhall deny my ſelf in greater matters? how ſhall I <gap reason="illegible: in crease" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> all for Christ, when I can't <gap reason="illegible: in crease" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> a Recreation for him.</item>
               <item>9. My uſing it is altogether needleſs and unneceſſary to me. As it hinders my Souls health, ſo it doth not further my bodily health. Such is my conſtitution (being Corpulent and Phlegmatick) that if I need any exerciſe, it is that which is ſtirring and labouring. I can't propound any end to my ſelf in the uſe of it, but the pleaſing of my fleſh.</item>
               <item>10. My uſing of it hath occaſioned (at times) ſome little expence of Money. This is the leaſt, and therfore I mention it laſt. I ſhould think much to give that to relieve others wants, that I have waſted this way at ſeveral times upon my own wantonneſs.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I Conclude with the paſſage of Mr. <hi>B.</hi> in his <hi>Chriſtian Direct.</hi> p. 464. Thus he writes. <q>I know not One perſon of an
Hundred, or of many Hundred, that needeth any Game at all, there are ſuch variety of better Exerciſes at hand to recreate
them. And it is a ſin to idle away any time which we can better improve. I confeſs my own nature was as much addicted
to playfulneſs as moſt, and my judgment alloweth ſo much Recreation as is needful to my Health and Labour, and no
more; but for all that, I find no need of any Game to recreate me. When my mind needs Recreation, I have variety
of recreating Books, and Friends, and buſineſs to do; that when my body needeth it, the hardeſt labour that I can bear, is my
beſt Recreation; Walking is inſtead of Games and Sports, as profitable to my body and more to my mind. If I am alone, I may
improve that time in Meditation; if with others, I may improve it in profitable chearfull conference. I condemn not all
Sports and Games in others, but I find none of them all to be beſt for my ſelf. And when I obſerve how far the temper
and life of Chriſt and his beſt ſervants, was from ſuch recreations, I avoid them with the more ſuſpicion. And I ſee but
few but diſtaſte it in Miniſters (even Shooting, Bowling, and ſuch more healthfull Games, to ſay nothing of theſe and ſuch
others as fit not the end of Recreation) therefore there is ſomewhat in it that Nature it ſelf hath ſome ſuſpicion of. That
Student that needeth Cheſs or Cards to pleaſe his mind, I doubt hath a Carnal empty mind; if God, and all his Books,
and all his Friends, &amp;c. cannot ſuffice for this, there is ſome diſeaſe in it that ſhould rather be cured than pleaſed. And for
the Body, it is another kind of exerciſe that profits it.</q>
