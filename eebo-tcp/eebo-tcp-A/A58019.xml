         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

when I cannot sacrifice an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Bulls.</p>
            <p>Without farther Ceremony or Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
according to my apprehension,
when we enquire into the Authority
and Nature of Parliaments, our thoughts
should be raised above all prejudice and
particularities; we should not conceive
of them, as of some Creature form'd
and nourisht under this or that Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
but have a Notion as large and
general, as is that of Government of
Civil Society.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:35676:6"/>We must not be confin'd to the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of this or that Age, or Countrey;
but consult the Universal reason and
sense of humane kind, where Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
has been exercised.</p>
            <p>Much less is any particular profession
or Faction of Writers, to be the only
Authors of Credit with us, in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
            <p>Our knowledge must be something
digested; and an impartial result from
a consideration of all as well Times and
Countries, as Writers and Customs.</p>
            <p>The Civilians, with their <hi>Bartolus</hi> and
<hi>Baldus,</hi> are not to dictate to us on this
occasion. These were bred out of the
corruption of the <hi>Roman</hi> liberty; and
were instruments of servitude from the
beginning. Their work was by hook
and crook, to rap and bring all under the
Emperours power; that was their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
that their Province. But they were
always ignorant of the practises of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times, and utter strangers to the
just Rights of a Free-people; their
Rules and their Maxims were, in effect,
no other, than so many stripes, so many
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35676:6"/>
marks and items of Slavery to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
            <p>Then, for the Municipal Lawyers of
every Nation, they also are educated
under too narrow a dispensation to think
justly in these matters.</p>
            <p>The Letter is their sphere where they
show their activity, even, sometimes, to
the perverting and turning it against the
reason and intentions of the Legislator.</p>
            <p>Their small niceties, and their subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and their inferences, are too fine
drawn to bear or support a matter of this
weight and circumference.</p>
            <p>Their Deductions and Argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
must ever be taken with some grains
of allowance; the cause here requires
other forms and considerations. We are
not to stick at the Letter, but go to the
foundation, to the inside and essence of
things.</p>
            <p>By their acquaintance with the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
and Laws, they may aid and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect,
but not over-rule; they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their Observations to strengthen the

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:35676:7"/>My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> tells us, Parliament is
derived from <hi>Parler le ment,</hi> i. e. from
speaking the mind. He might as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
have taught us that firmament is
<hi>firma mentis,</hi> a farm for the mind; or fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament,
the bottom of the mind.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Cook,</hi> how sage soever other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
in Parliament-house is no more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
than <hi>Thomas Aquinas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And take him from his ordinary Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
his Reasons are many times as
ridiculous as his Etymologies.</p>
            <p>Then for the Holy Scripture; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of it is no more to teach us Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
than to make us Philosophers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ahaz</hi>'s Dial is no President for our
time or measures; nor may the <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy</hi>
of the <hi>Iews</hi> authorize us to set up
for King Jesus.</p>
            <p>Our blessed Saviour did not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
whether <hi>Caesar</hi> demanded Tribute,
as Tribune and Servant of the people;
and whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
still Democratical, (as <hi>Caesar</hi> preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
or was Monarchical, as, in effect, it
prov'd.</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghost neither alter'd the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35676:7"/>
complexion, nor refin'd the education;
but a shepherd, notwithstanding the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
he delivered, continued the same
in other circumstances, as if he never had
been inspir'd.</p>
            <p>In like manner, where-ever Christ is
Preached, the Soul-saving Doctrine in no
wise operates upon the policy or civil
Constitutions; but leaves those affairs to
be influenc'd by the ordinary prudence
and discretion.</p>
            <p>Whether it be some particular gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
in our Nature, that renders us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of slavery: or whether the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perateness
of the Climate inclines us to
a moderation in our Government: Or
whether it may be some favourable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Planets, (as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> would
perswade us) that disposes <hi>Europe</hi> to the
love of Liberty.</p>
            <p>So far as any Record or History can
inform us, That Arbitrary and unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
domination, so familiar in the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern
parts of the world, amongst us
did always shew uncouth, and to be
stared upon no less than their Elephants.
And indeed to us seem altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35676:8"/>
with a civil people.</p>
            <p>And it can be no more the business
of the Gospel to reconcile us to that
yoak, than it is to Emasculate our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
and nature, to change the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of our Climate, or to turn our Stars
from their Course.</p>
            <p>All power is from God, and we are
to be subject to the higher powers; this
all consent to; this is Doctrine alike true
in <hi>Holland,</hi> as in <hi>France,</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> as at
<hi>Constantinople.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But where this high power and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
rests, in whom 'tis lodged, this
is a point not so obvious: Nor can the
S. S. or holy Fathers any way help us
in the discovery.</p>
            <p>The Customs and particular Laws of
every Nation, are only capable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
us in that scrutiny.</p>
            <p>Obedience is as much a duty, and
Rebellion as black a sin where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
are King, as where a single person
has the Soveraign sway.</p>
            <p>The Title of King, Monarch, or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
the Scepter, the Crown, the
Royal Throne, with all the Robes and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35676:8"/>
pomps and badges of Soveraignty, and
the precedence before other Christian
Kings, have the shadow of Majesty, but
have none of the substance, as <hi>Bodin</hi>
truly observes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Caesars</hi> were never so absolute, as
when the Senate had the show, and the
name of all. But afterwards when
their power declin'd, then did their sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
lengthen, and the Titles swell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all sobriety and proportion.</p>
            <p>The French Parliaments in their Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
Robes, know none of that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
power which their plain Ancestors
so long had exercised in their grey
jackets.</p>
            <p>The Pontificalibus and Formality, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogates
from the antiquity and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency.
And our House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
may seem in a manner, (if I may
so say) to have committed some kind of
Solecism, in taking a Mace to be carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before them, but that their simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and plainness otherwise sufficiently
demonstrates them the true, sincere, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
fundamental, common Councel,
constituted and form'd before Forms and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35676:9"/>
Pageantries and Fopperies obtain'd in
our English world.</p>
            <p>For badge and ornament they had
<hi>Iupiter</hi>'s Scepter; which <hi>Pluto</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets
to be, not a tipt Batoon, or glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
engraven thing, but the Laws
and Legislative power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Homer</hi> has taught the world to call
Kings Pastors of the people. We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
not the charge of our Cattle to any
one of the Herd, nor for our sheep do
we choose one out of the flock to be
their shepherd; but set over them a
more excellent sort of Animal, some
Man is appointed for the Neatherd, and
for the Shepherd, to govern and take
the charge of them.</p>
            <p>Now since for the conduct and sway
over men, the world is not furnisht with
any species more noble than Man, Art
supplies what wanted in Nature; an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
man is fram'd, a politick creature, a
King that never dyes, that can do no
wrong, that cannot be deceived, whose
Counsels and Determinations are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
of the joynt experience and wisdom
of a whole Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:35676:9"/>Now whether this artificial, may be
call'd a mixt sort of Government, as
the antients imagin'd. Or that it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally,
essentially, and fundamentally
a Democracy Monarchical in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration,
as <hi>Bodin</hi> and our Modern Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians
seem to understand. This cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
is the Government that always
has obtain'd in <hi>Europe;</hi> and that which
all, amidst their Commotions, Distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Convulsions, in some manner
or other, with more or less success and
perfection, have tended to, as the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and onely place of rest.</p>
            <p>If therefore the Jews had desired a
King after the manner of the <hi>Europeans,</hi>
their importunity peradventure might
not have been so provoking to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.
And we should have found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
kind of Catalogue of their fair
qualities, than that delivered us by the
Prophet. For however their <hi>Asian</hi> or
<hi>African</hi> Neighbours might have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer'd
it, and bluster'd; a calmer gale
was always wont to breath amongst us
in <hi>Europe,</hi> And, God be thankt, we
are many degrees Northern Latitude
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35676:10"/>
from <hi>Og</hi> the King of <hi>Bashan,</hi> and the
Lands of those other Gyants, <hi>Amalekites,</hi>
and <hi>Philistines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Writers amongst us had
their imaginations so over-born with the
excellency of Kingly Government, that
they fancied in Heaven <hi>Iupiter</hi> to be the
King of the Gods. And yet they
thought the Common Councel so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and essential, that <hi>Homer</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
even <hi>Iupiter,</hi> upon a great occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
calling his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, his Parliament of
the Gods.</p>
            <l>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</l>
            <l>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</l>
            <p>I have heard Divines observe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of this kind, as figured of God
Almighty from those words, <hi>Let us make
Man.</hi> Those words in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to them seemed to import, as if God
summon'd a Parliament of the Trinity,
to consult upon that arduous affair.</p>
            <p>Our Christian Poets have taken the
same liberty, and fancied this, as an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of Greatness, where could be no
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35676:10"/>
accession to the wisdom and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>But again, <hi>Homer</hi> (whom <hi>Plato</hi> in his
Book of Laws, mentions as a Prophet,
and one who reveals those things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Government, by inspiration,
which are not by humane knowledge to
be attain'd) to shew the utmost inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and barbarity of the <hi>Cyclopses</hi> and
their Government, tells us, <hi>They neither
held Parliaments for Counsel, nor had
right.</hi>
            </p>
            <l>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</l>
            <p>He joyns Parliament and right, as of
late days <hi>Guicciardine</hi> does Parliament
and Liberty; as if Parliament, Right,
and Liberty, were to stand and fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And indeed amongst the Greeks, how
many persons, excellent otherwise, have
been branded for Tyrants and Monsters,
and made odious to all posterity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they affected a more singular and
unbounded power than was consistent
with the Customs and Constitutions of
their Country?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:35676:11"/>Nor was this Policy less known or
practiz'd by the Latines. None of the
antient Kings of <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> exercis'd
other Government than by Parliament,
till <hi>Tarquin</hi> the Proud with much Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem
and Artifice attempted a new
way. But how fatal did he find that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation?</p>
            <p>Afterwards that the <hi>Caesars</hi> usurped
the Empire, when their power was the
highest, they affected to have all done
in the name of the people and Senate.
<hi>Neque tam parvum quicquam, neque tam
magnum publici privatique negotii, de quo
non ad Patres Conscriptos referrebatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And notwithstanding the antient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and Government was so run down,
yet on some occasions, the authority of
the Senate would be exerting itself.</p>
            <p>They declared <hi>Nero</hi> an Enemy of the
State, and their Sentence had its effect.</p>
            <p>Nor could (the delight of humane
kind) <hi>Titus,</hi> though so far engaged in
love and honour, stem the authority of
the Senate, in favour of his dear <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi>
but was forced to dismiss her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they forbad the Banes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:35676:11"/>And in effect, the power of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
once gone, that of the Emperors
signified little; the giddy Souldiers
broke all Rules and Measures. They
mutinied, and made and unmade Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
where, and when, and whom they
had a mind to. So that the Emperour
was onely Tenant at will to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>Our Botchers of History, shew a jolly
Succession of Monarchs on their file for
<hi>Britain</hi> in those days. But <hi>Caesars</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries
are of much better Credit, who
represents the Government of <hi>Gaul</hi> and
<hi>Britain,</hi> as muchwhat the same in his
time; says he of <hi>Britain, Summa Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii
bellique administrandi Communi Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio
permissa est Cassivellano,</hi> &amp;c. The chief
Command and Conduct of the War,
was by the Common Councel commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to <hi>Cassivellaun.</hi> Compare these
words with what he writes of the <hi>Gauls,
l. 7. Re in Controversiam deductâ totius
Galliae Consilium Bibracte indicitur, eodem
conveniunt undique frequentes multitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
suffragiis res permittitur, ad unum om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
Vercengentorigem probant Imperato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem.</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:35676:12"/>
Here the Counsel of all <hi>Gaul,</hi> by
reason of the War, put it to the Vote
who shall be their General; and it was
carried with a <hi>nemine contradicente</hi> for
<hi>Vercengentorix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis beyond dispute, that their
Government continued the same in the
times of which <hi>Dion Cassius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus</hi>
write.</p>
            <p>Nor is their uniformity so strange,
considering the Authority of the <hi>Druyds,</hi>
and their correspondence in both Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> came
from <hi>Germany</hi> to people <hi>Britain</hi> and
<hi>Gaul,</hi> the <hi>German</hi> Liberty and moderate
sway were transplanted with them; and
still the Common Councel had the main
stroke in all weighty affairs; for to that
Policy had they also been educated.</p>
            <p>The Scheme of the <hi>German</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
appears in these passages of <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.
De minoribus rebus Principes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultant,
de majoribus Omnes.</hi> In lesser
matters the principal men onely, in the
greatest affairs all consult.</p>
            <p>Elsewhere he says of them, <hi>Vbi Rex
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35676:12"/>
vel Princeps audiuntur Authoritate sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi
magis quam jubendi potestate.</hi> Where
the King or Prince are heard for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
they bring to perswade, rather than
for any Authority to command.</p>
            <p>Hereby 'tis manifest, that in <hi>Germany</hi>
also the people had their share in deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and directing all affairs of moment.</p>
            <p>When therefore the <hi>French</hi> under <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramond,</hi>
or <hi>Pharamond,</hi> came to settle and
mix with the <hi>Gauls,</hi> whatever other
differences might happen, in point of
Government they were agreed before
hand, both resting upon the same Basis,
the Common Councel.</p>
            <p>Accordingly in those first days, we
find them making their Kings, and again
upon occasion unmaking them by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
consent. Hence come these Phrases
so frequent in <hi>Aimoinus, Sigebert, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genhardus,</hi>
and the other Writers of those
times. <hi>Consensu Francorum, Electione
Francorum, Secundum Morem Francorum,
in Regem electus,</hi> &amp;c. On the other
hand, <hi>Franci regno deturbant, a Francis
repudiatur, depositus ac detonsus in mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterium
detrusus est, a Francis in Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chum<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35676:13"/>
 tonsuratur,</hi> &amp;c. Where we may
note, that our Authors intend by their
<hi>per Francos,</hi> as much as <hi>per consensum
Francorum,</hi> or <hi>secundum morem Francorum,</hi>
which is, by the Common Counsel, and
not in any unusual, mutinous, and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous
way, as some might object.</p>
            <p>Nor are we to imagine the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
presently altered, so often as we
find the Historians varying their phrase.
We must now and then be content with
such words as the Monks of those times
were pleased to coyn for us, and have
new barbarous Names for the same old
Civil Constitution.</p>
            <p>Whether they speak of <hi>Germany,</hi> of
the French, or of our Nation, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
diversifie, and employ for the

the appellations and circumlocutions

            <p>Now these Quotations and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
shew, not only that by all this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Names were understood the

nor signified other manner of Men, than
the very same with <hi>Populus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the same Assembly by one Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

those terms <hi>secundam morem, juxta mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,

send us back to <hi>Tacitus, Consultant de

            </p>
            <p>This I the rather note, because I find
Mr. <hi>Petty</hi> (amongst many other his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Memorials) observing the like in
old Records of Parliament, where those
somewhere called <hi>Populus,</hi> and <hi>Vulgus,</hi>
and the <hi>Commons,</hi> are otherwhiles dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
with the gay additions of <hi>Noble,
Most Noble, Most Illustrious, Most Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
Seigniors, Monseigniours,</hi> and <hi>Sires</hi>
the <hi>Commons</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And likewise for that some unwary
and superficial Readers from this root
have propagated and improved many
Errours of pernicious consequence to our
ancient and Fundamental Policy and
Government.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> incorporating and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one people with the former Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
had a much easier Province; they
setled, and pursued their Native Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35676:15"/>
and Forms of Government, nor
met with that difficulty and opposition
which in this Nation attended the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
and <hi>Saxons.</hi> These had a much har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
game to play. These could in no
wise fix, or find any sure footing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
first clearing their way, and driving
the <hi>Britains</hi> up by themselves, into a
corner of the Land.</p>
            <p>And after much tumbling and bustle,
we find them formed into a Heptarchy.</p>
            <p>How regularly they mov'd as to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Affairs, how closely they followed
their Country-Customs, or where they
innovated and varied from their <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Forms and Policy, in those dark
times, is hard to be traced.</p>
            <p>Some footsteps however appeared
then, which remained to posterity, as
the division of the Countrey into <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds,</hi>
after the <hi>German</hi> manner described
by <hi>Tacitus.</hi> Besides the other Royalties
in the people, as that of appointing
<hi>Sheriffs,</hi> and choosing Annual Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
the jurisdiction and <hi>power of life</hi>
and death by our Juries, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And even before all came united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35676:16"/>
one Monarch, we find the people
interposing their Authority, and (for
the miscarriages of Queen <hi>Edburga</hi>)
providing that thereafter, <hi>No Queen shall
sit by the King, nor have the Title of
Queen, but be called only the Kings Wife.
Gens itaque occidentalium</hi> Saxonum <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginam

Mals. But I shall not repeat what <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
and <hi>Selden,</hi> and our other Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
have collected on this occasion; but
<hi>Germany</hi> being the source both of our
people and Laws, I choose rather <hi>pete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
fontes.</hi> And thence it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
how far we do <hi>stare super vias an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquas,</hi>
and continue firm upon the old
bottom.</p>
            <p>When the People and Senate of <hi>Rome</hi>
had transferred all their right upon
<hi>Charles</hi> the Great (or <hi>Charlemain,</hi> as the
<hi>French</hi> call him) and <hi>Germany</hi> was made
the seat of the Western Empire, one
might think, if there could be an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of introducing a new form of
Policy, this was the time. Yet <hi>Charles,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:35676:16"/>
so victorious, so august, so great, the
like in no age before him or since ever
known on this side the <hi>Alps,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all that power and fortune, and
the Imperial Crown that adorn'd him,
his Language was still the high <hi>German,</hi>
and his Government did still in the old
Parliamentary way go on and prosper.</p>
            <p>Therefore we find him every year
with his Parliament. <hi>Eginhardus,</hi> who
was his Son-in-law, and Chancellour,
says of him, <hi>Rex sic ad publicum popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li
sui conventum qui annuatim ob regni uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem
celebrabatur, ire, sic domum redire
solebat.</hi> And <hi>Aimoynus, l. 4. c. 74. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralem

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to these Parliaments,</hi> under God,
so far as humane reason may judge, <hi>does</hi>
Hincmar <hi>(Archbishop of</hi> Rheims, <hi>and
Chancellour in those times) ascribe his
happy Reign.</hi> Secunda divisio, qua toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us

            <p>All this seems but a Paraphrase upon
the passage afore-cited out of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> as
to the Form of Government. The
<hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Seniors</hi> are for the matters
of less weight; the former here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
was the <hi>generale placitum,</hi> which
the <hi>Germans</hi> more particularly call, <hi>Die

            </p>
            <p>He shows us likewise how binding
these their Ordinances were, and not to

necessity,</hi> not a suggested, invisible, Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessity,
but <hi>quae toti regno incumbebat,
a necessity</hi> that lay upon the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>In effect, the Parliament <hi>Ordered,</hi> and
he <hi>Executed</hi> their Orders; his Office
was the Administration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:35676:17"/>Amongst other particulars, we find
him in Parliament adjusting the matter
of <hi>Succession,</hi> as <hi>Eginhard,</hi> and the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot

            <p>Nor was this done onely out of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality,
and for the greater state and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
on those occasions, for we some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
find them refusing to grant what

            </p>

            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:35676:18"/>And seeing that this of Succession, is
one of those points that are of greatest
importance, 'tis strange how the right
of Electing the Emperors came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to be left in so few hands, and to
be setled in the Seven only, who, in
course of time got the name of <hi>Princes
Electors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither the occasion, nor the time
when this Custom began, can be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.
Some would deduce it from
<hi>Charles</hi> the Great. Some from <hi>Otho</hi> the
Third, who Reigned about the year
990. Others from <hi>Otho</hi> the Fourth,
<hi>An.</hi> 1200. Others again from <hi>Henry</hi>
the Second, who was Emperour, <hi>An,</hi>
1001.</p>
            <p>From which uncertainty we may on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gather, that the Custom was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Ancient. But it is not to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
that the other States by any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Act transferred the right upon those
<hi>Seven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst the fallacies and cheats of
State, whereby the rich Men may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon the poorer sort, and worm
them out of all their share in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35676:19"/>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> reckons these: <hi>That
it be penal for the rich to be absent from
the Common Councils, to refuse being in
Office, to want, or omit the exercise of Arms,
not to serve upon Iuries,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
sort may use their discretion, it shall not
be penal to them; they may choose whether
or no they will be present in Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
bear Office, be at the charge of Arms
and Training, be impannel'd upon Iuries,</hi>
&amp;c. In these cases this specious liberty
fools and bewitches them: for so long
as no restraint is upon them, and they
are not excluded or slighted, or disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected
any way in the matter, they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
follow their private occasions at
home, and the business of their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
And thus by degrees insensibly is
the Commonwealth and Government
changed. And that is effected by art
and trick, which openly and fairly
could never have been brought to pass.</p>
            <p>We need not think that the <hi>Germans</hi>
were over-reached by any the like So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry
and deceitful Laws; but 'tis
likely, that to many it was sufficient,
that it lay in their choice whether they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35676:19"/>
would act or no; and in that security
many sate down: Some could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
spare time from their Family;
some were indifferent which way the
world went; some could not part from
their dear delights, their Pots and their
Hounds; and some staid at home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they could not make that show,
and appear in a pomp and equipage like
their Neighbours. By reason of these,
and a many the like weighty considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
together with a general degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateness,
supineness, and neglect of the
publick, the affairs of State became a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd,
and shuffl'd into a very few
hands; insomuch that few besides those
now called the Seven Electors, made
any great figure, or much labour'd in
that sphere.</p>
            <p>But those seven were suffered from
time to time by a silent usurpation to
manage all, till insensibly it grew into a
Custom.</p>
            <p>So that (under <hi>Charles</hi> the Fourth,
when the Priviledges and Rights of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
body came to be stated, and reduced
by general consent into a standing Law)
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35676:20"/>
in the beginning of the <hi>Golden Bull,</hi> this
Ministry of the Seven Electors is said
to be <hi>an ancient and laudable custom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some will have these Electors to be a
Committee of the whole Empire, and
that (there being one King, one Duke,
one Marquess, one Count, with the
Churchmen) all the several orders in the
Empire are represented by them; and
consequently that their Act is vertually
the Act of the Empire.</p>
            <p>But it seems more reasonable, that
this sort of an Aristocracie sprung up to
overtop the ancient more popular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
by the negligence or inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertency
of the other Orders; who were
satisfied in seeing the Emperour thereby
effectually held within compass, and had
no care or consideration farther.</p>
            <p>For all their fears and apprehensions
had risen from the Emperour, and, so be
that they might be secured against his
encroachments and oppression, they
were content to set up those Electors;
to oppose the Emperour, and stand as a
bulwark betwixt him and them.</p>
            <p>And therefore by their free Act in the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35676:20"/>
Golden Bull, they settle and confirm to
the Electors that Prerogative, which
no prescription otherwise could have
made just and authentick:</p>
            <p>Above an hundred years before, in
the Church had the Government chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
face; an Aristocracy obtain'd, and
the Election of the Pope ceased to be
longer popular.</p>
            <p>About the same time, in <hi>England</hi> also,
the old Laws and Policy ran a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
risque from an inundation of Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
power, that threatned to break
down all the ancient banks and Barriers.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Normans,</hi> having come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, partly by consent, partly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force,
pust up and wanton with their new
acquisitions and swing of fortune, they
could not well be kept within bounds.
Now and then Speeches of Conquest and
holding by the Sword, and the like bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles,
were bandyed to and fro amongst
the giddy Courtiers, with now and then
a Sally and Inroad upon the people,
trampling Property under foot.</p>
            <p>These Insolencies and Invasions kept
the Nation awake, and put them upon
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35676:21"/>
their guard, to wait an opportunity
whereby their ancient Rights and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
might be reduced into Form, and
solemnly recognis'd by succeeding Kings
in the <hi>Great Charter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was the Cockatrice crushed in
the Egg; and an early stop put to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
sway in <hi>England;</hi> and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
returned to its old center of
Parliaments again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Germany,</hi> in this juncture, lay most
open and exposed. The Emperor, <hi>Lord
of the World,</hi> and <hi>Head of the Nations,</hi>
Successour to those <hi>Caesars</hi> that had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
down all Forms and Fences, so that
Liberty and Property lay wast every
where before them.</p>
            <p>These owed all their power to the
<hi>Sword.</hi> The <hi>Imperial Crown,</hi> the <hi>Lex
regia,</hi> the whole bulk and body of the
<hi>Civil Law,</hi> were wholly and entirely
their own proper creature; and what
more might be devised to make a Prince
unlimited, uncontrolable, great, and
barbarous, and render him a <hi>Cyclops</hi> or
a <hi>Leviathan?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the result was, the <hi>Customs</hi> and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35676:21"/>
Liberties of the <hi>Germans</hi> were far more
ancient and more <hi>Sacred</hi> to them, than
any <hi>New Song</hi> that the <hi>Civilians</hi> could
teach them.</p>
            <p>Therefore all this long rattle of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Prerogative onely alarm'd them,
and made them provide the better for
their security.</p>
            <p>And as their danger was the most
threatning, and arm'd with stronger
Titles and pretensious than in other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
so have they with more care
sought their preservation. And the
<hi>Golden Bull</hi> with them was framed, and
had the same effect as <hi>Magna Charta</hi>
with us; which they strengthen and
make supplements to, by new Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
upon occasion, according as the
Emperors abuse their power, or that
tricks are devised, by colour of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to elude the honest intention of that
Fundamental Law and Constitution.</p>
            <p>Thus we see it true, in respect of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignes,
as well as of Subjects, That
<hi>evil manners</hi> are the cause of <hi>good</hi> and
wholesome <hi>Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> have no <hi>Golden Bull,</hi> nor
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35676:22"/>
               <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> peradventure, because no
King of theirs had those pretentions of
Conquest, as the <hi>Normans</hi> here; nor had
that Imperial Title of the Sword, and
the Civil Laws, as the <hi>Caesars,</hi> to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them beyond the bounds of Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Reason.</p>
            <p>Which put them upon other Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and gave them opportunity step
by step, slily, insensibly, and surely, to
effect what more openly could never
have succeeded.</p>
            <p>`As in the Fable, the storm and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the Wind could not force away
the Travellers Cloak from him; but
the Sun coming silently upon him, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
him presently, makes him unbut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
and strips him of all.</p>
            <p>Noise and bluster make the people
the more obstinate and tenacious. But
things remote affect them not. They
never see consequences, nor lay ought
to heart that is not immediately present
before their eyes.</p>
            <p>If any thing now and then in the
course of their Kings Reign happen'd
that was shocking, all was lookt upon
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35676:22"/>
as some personal and accidental slip on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
without foundation for continuance,
or without giving jealousie of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
to posterity.</p>
            <p>About an hundred years after <hi>Magna
Charta</hi> was establisht, was that project of
the Modern Parliament in <hi>France</hi> set on
foot, to render unnecessary the ancient
Assembly of the States, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to alter the Government.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>English</hi> Arms gave check to
their wanton career, and for a long
time diverted them from pursuing that
design, or bringing it to any head.</p>
            <p>However, this new Assembly and
Vice-Parliament was cultivated and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
daily. They assumed all the
Power, they consulted and determined
the weighty Affairs; and in case the
King offered any violence to the Laws,
they encounter'd and oppos'd his exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
courses; they lay before him his
Coronation-Oath, and plyed him with
Remonstrance upon Remonstrance, till
they brought him to Reason.</p>
            <p>Neither War nor Alliance could be
made, nor could any his Edict or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35676:23"/>
have effect, till Ratified and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by them.</p>
            <p>So that to the unwary multitude
these serv'd the turn as well; these were
as effectual and sufficient, and more
ready and expeditious than the great old
Parliament.</p>
            <p>But afterwards came new-fashioned
Kings to Reign, who would not be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
by Reasons or Remonstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>And yet then also, was a formal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
of this Parliament thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary;
and, as an expedient, when not
satisfyed in Conscience that an Edict
ought to be Ratifyed, was introduced
that clause, <hi>Mandato Regis;</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
that they did not ratifie such an
Edict upon their own judgment, but
that they were over-ruled by the Kings
particular command.</p>
            <p>Afterwards again came the <hi>expresso
Mandato,</hi> and <hi>expressissimo Mandato Regis,</hi>
according as they passed it with a greater
reluctancy, and greater violence had
been offered to their judgment.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, who had fought
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35676:23"/>
through all opposition into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and had subdued to his will all
that had fac'd him in the field, grew
impatient, after so great Contrasts, to
find his resolutions crost, and contested
by tame Gownmen; therefore, to rid
himself at once of all those verbal frays
and formalities, made a Law, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
the Kings Edicts should be Ratified
and <hi>Emologated</hi> upon sight, without more
formal trifling and dispute.</p>
            <p>Thus were those remains of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
power, that had surviv'd in this
diminutive Parliament, baffl'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct,
without much labour.</p>
            <p>But as they never possessed the vigor
and spirit of the Ancient Assembly;
the people were never so stupid to trust,
or lay much stress on their valour and
performance.</p>
            <p>And therefore did more early show
their resentment; nor without a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
convulsion and Civil War, could
bear the apprehension of a Court-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to lay aside the old Parliament.</p>
            <p>It was the boast of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh
on this occasion, that he had <hi>Mis la Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>auté
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35676:24"/>
hors du page,</hi> He had so ordered
matters, that the <hi>Royal State</hi> should be
no more a <hi>Pupil;</hi> in him it came of <hi>age</hi>
to dispose things, and act of its own
head, and should not need to be <hi>tutor'd</hi>
or be under a <hi>Guardian</hi> any longer.</p>
            <p>This was a Prince of a particular hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and of singular endowments.
It was no wonder if he did not like the
check of a Parliament; he had before
attempted by two or three Rebellions
to free himself from the Authority of
his King and Father.</p>
            <p>The good old King <hi>Charles,</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
weathered the open violence, but
fear of poyson overcame him; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r five days
fasting dyed.</p>
            <p>And now <hi>Lewis</hi> being King, his first
work was to clear the Court from all
who had serv'd his Father, and pack off
all the Princes of the Blood, and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Nobility, and to create a new set of
Nobles and Courtiers for his purpose.</p>
            <p>The people took the Alarm, and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour'd
for a Parliament to regulate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35676:24"/>
and prevent the evils that threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and hung over them. A Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a Parliament, was the cry and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
throughout the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The Bishop of <hi>Paris</hi> and Clergy, the
Courts of Justice, and the City, (the
Three bodies of greatest consideration
and gravity) presented to him their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Remonstrances.</p>
            <p>He (dissembling being his Talent)
took all kindly; and to break their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
or divert them, he took six
persons out of each of their Companies,
to be of his ordinary Counsel; in show
onely; for in effect he was still the
same.</p>
            <p>And amongst the prosligate rabble
about the Court, there wanted not in
the mean time a sort of wretches who
made an Hubbub, and as formally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
their detestation and abhorrence
of their practises that had importun'd
the King with their Remonstrances, and
call'd it an unparallell'd violation of
their duty. Nay, (<hi>Philip de Comines</hi>
tells us,) the Courtiers went so far, they
call'd it <hi>Rebellion</hi> to mention a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35676:25"/>
Nor was it strange such Cattle
then should be sheltered about the
Court, when a <hi>Mounte bank</hi> was set up
for Lord Chancellor, <hi>Taylors</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bars
(Iohan de Doyac,</hi> Olivier <hi>le diable
dit le Dain,</hi> &amp;c.) the prime Ministers of
State.</p>
            <p>This jarring and misunderstanding
was followed by a Civil War, which
was call'd <hi>The publick good.</hi> This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
a Parliament. And this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
would no longer trust <hi>Lewis</hi> single
with the Administration of Affairs;
but appointed him Thirty six Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
(<hi>Curateurs</hi>) to be his Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.
However, <hi>Lewis</hi>'s excellency lay
in playing an after-game.</p>
            <p>In the War, he had sent to his Allie
<hi>Alexander Sforza</hi> for aid; who returned
him answer, that Men he had none to
spare, but would give advise which
should be as effectual; so the <hi>Italian</hi>
advis'd him <hi>Always to agree with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
upon any conditions, then find the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to cut their Throats.</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to this, <hi>Bodin</hi> speaks of him, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem
inire coactus est, sed eos omnes clam
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35676:25"/>
aut apertè, paucis admodum exceptis, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candos
curavit fratrem, quoque</hi> Carolum
<hi>veneno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the dexterity which <hi>Comines</hi>
so much labours to gloss over, and set
a countenance upon; these the <hi>belles
Actions,</hi> and the <hi>finesse,</hi> which the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<hi>French</hi> so much celebrate at this
day; all is copyed from this Original.</p>
            <p>Perjuries and Poysons were his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Arms, yet none so devout, none
so superstitious, none made the like lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesses
to the Church. But his Masses
and Pilgrimages did always portend
some strange horrid Murder about to be
executed.</p>
            <p>These were but personal Vices; his
eajoling the Citizens, and affected Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry
to their Wives, was politick e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
But what prov'd most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to his design of changing the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and excluding Parliaments,
was his laying aside the Franc-Archers;
who hitherto had been the Train'd-bands,
and ordinary Militia of the Country.</p>
            <p>In the War (call'd <hi>the pulick good</hi>) he
found that those Franc-Archers (being
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35676:26"/>
men of a setled Habitation, and way of
living) took part with their Landlords
and Neighbours against him; therefore
from thence-forward he slighted them,
and by beat of drum from Town to
Town, gathered and listed such as
voluntarily offer'd themselves to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>These were then called <hi>Adventurers,</hi>
because they sought their adventure by
the fortune of War; as afterward when
<hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth carryed them over
the <hi>Alps,</hi> they got the name of <hi>Souldiers,</hi>
from the <hi>Sold</hi> or pay they received up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Expedition.</p>
            <p>But as this <hi>Lewis</hi> could not trust the
<hi>Militia,</hi> so within a little time he began
to think himself not safe amongst his
<hi>Adventurers.</hi> These yet were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
enough from the interest of their
Countrey, and had some small sense of
its oppression.</p>
            <p>Thereupon, for the more immediate
guards of his person, he takes into pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
Four thousand <hi>Switzers.</hi> And by
that establishment, seems to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
his design, and alter'd the old
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35676:26"/>
Parliamentary, into a Military Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>And now it was not so hard a matter
to borrow Money of the Citizens, and
otherwise make those Levies which no
King before him ever attempted.</p>
            <p>Thus it was that he brought the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
<hi>hors du page;</hi> or, rather (according
to the Paraphrase of their Historian <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeray)
hors du sense &amp; du raisonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though in <hi>Germany</hi> the condition of
their Parliaments is not altogether so
deplorable and desperate; yet of later
times there have not wanted lusty en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
by force and by artifice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them.</p>
            <p>Right and wrong are ever the same,
but Times and Manners vary faces ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much. One while instead of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
penalty for a crime, it was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
that the Law censur'd it with an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probè
factum.</hi> To say he that does so,
or so, is to blame, was more effectual
and <hi>coercive</hi> in those <hi>Saturnian</hi> days, than
are Racks and Gibbets with us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Radamanthus</hi> his way of administring
Iustice in all causes between party and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35676:27"/>
was by putting them both to their Oaths,
and determining their right accordingly.</p>
            <p>This, <hi>says</hi> Plato, was a proper and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
way in that age, when every body was
possessed with the fear of God. <hi>But, says
he,</hi> this would not do, now in our times,
when some make it a question whether there
be a God or no; others make a doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God regards what we do on earth;
most and the worst of men have a conceit,
that though there be a God, yet they can
pacifie him with their vile Adulations,
their Mummeries and their Masses; so
that they may still be as wicked as they
please.</p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>says he,</hi> when mens opinions
are chang'd, the Laws also must be chang'd;
for, otherwise, if our Iudges now were to
make <hi>Radamanthus</hi> their President, we
should all be over head and ears in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</p>
            <p>The like may be observ'd in relation
to Sovereigns. In old times at first
there was onely a simple confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them and their people. And ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
were Kings so reserv'd, as then when
they had no bounds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:35676:27"/>Afterwards, the Misbehaviour of some
Princes introduced that check of a Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation-Oath.
And where that is the
only check, `tis an argument they had
never yet been there tainted with the
Atheism, and infidelity, which <hi>Plato</hi>
mentions; but had continually liv'd and
rul'd with that simplicity and religious
fear, so memorable in those days when
<hi>Minos</hi> and <hi>Radamanthus</hi> were King and
Chief Justice of <hi>Crete.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Claude Seisselle</hi> reckons several <hi>refrains,</hi>
bridles, that curb the <hi>French</hi> Kings. But
now when the old Parliament is obso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete,
this would be remarkt upon, as a
graceless unmannerly Metaphor, in the
<hi>refined</hi> language.</p>
            <p>In the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> at first their
Prince was as absolute as any <hi>Barbarian;</hi>
till having strayed, and given some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of humane frailty, new curbs
and new tyes were devised for him. But
the <hi>Italian</hi> prov'd still too witty to be
held by any.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> however would not be
dallyed withal, they would not suffer
the Transgressour to rejoyce long in his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35676:28"/>
extravagance, but pursued him with
exemplary punishment: <hi>Sabellicus</hi> rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
to the number of Twelve that lost
their Heads for slipping their bridles.</p>
            <p>At the length, when the <hi>Venetians</hi>
found that neither the simple trust was
sacred, nor the Coronation-Oath invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
nor the exemplary punishment
effectual to contain their Prince within
the bounds that were consistent with a
Free people; They concluded that the
publick safety could not be sufficiently
provided for, and secured against their
Prince, till they stript him of all the
reality and substance, leaving him bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Formalities and Trappings, and
empty shadow of Soveraignty.</p>
            <p>Now to come to the <hi>Germans;</hi> what
ever shifts other people have been put
to, to maintain their Liberty, they (it
should seem) never trusted the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
out of their own hands. So that
whether it be a <hi>mixt,</hi> or what other
sort of Government you call it; the
great Affairs were always reserv'd to be
determin'd in Parliament; there was
the Supreme power, there was the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:35676:28"/>Yet no people have been forwarder in
adorning their Prince with all the Titles
and expressions of greatness, and an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary,
uncontrolable power, than
they.</p>
            <p>All the Acts and Laws run in his
name; and are called <hi>Caesars</hi> Laws, and
<hi>Caesars</hi> Constitutions.</p>
            <p>Where the Emperor and the Empire
are named, he constantly has the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence.</p>
            <p>In the publick Ordinances and <hi>Reces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
every thing from him are stiled Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and Commands; from the States
merely obedience and prayers, though
he cannot wag a finger without their
consent.</p>
            <p>They every where speak of, and own
in him a fulness of power <hi>vollncommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heit.</hi>
And this they give also to the
King of the <hi>Romans</hi> at the same time;
to show the emptiness and vanity of it.
As both are call'd Heads of the Empire,
though the latter has no power at all,
during the Emperors life.</p>
            <p>They and all the world salute him by
the Title of Imperial Majesty. And
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35676:29"/>
the <hi>German</hi> Style will not allow Majesty
to any other Kings; <hi>die Koniglicher
Wurde,</hi> not <hi>die Koniglicher Maht,</hi> the
Kings Worship, not Majesty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet after all,</hi> Aeneas Sylvius <hi>says,</hi> in
Germ. c. 43. Imperatorem, &amp; Regem, &amp;
Dominum vestrum esse fateamini, precario
tamen ille imperare videtur, nulla ejus
potestas est.</p>
            <p>The shadow and flourish onely were
in the Emperor; but the <hi>jura Majestatis,</hi>
the <hi>vis imperii,</hi> the essentials of Majesty
were always reserv'd and exercis'd by
the common Assembly, as by the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
may more plainly appear.</p>
            <p>1. One of the Rights of Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is to be above the Law, and to give
Laws to the people.</p>
            <p>Neither of these Royalties belong to
the Emperour; he may be call'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for violating the Laws. In the
<hi>Golden Bull,</hi> the Forms and Proceedings
against him are stated. `Tis there said
to be the <hi>Custom,</hi> and accordingly setl'd
and agreed for Law, that the Electors
may <hi>Impeach</hi> the Emperor, in the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the States; and the Count Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35676:29"/>
of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> as Chief Elector, is
to be the President or Judge.</p>
            <p>For the Legislation, or making Laws,
the Emperor proposes, the States are
free which Propositions they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon. When an Act is to be pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
the Electors have six Votes, the
Princes six, the Cities two, the Emperor
has but one (the last) Vote. Without a
Majority he can do nothing: They can
Decree without him if he is absent. The
Ordinances are to be confirm'd by his
Seal and Subscription; but if the States
persist, he must of necessity comply.
Even <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth in vain contested
that point, as may be seen in <hi>Sleidan,
I.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>These Sanctions are regularly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by <hi>Caesar,</hi> and by some of the
States for the Empire; and are Enrolled
(at <hi>Mentz</hi>) in the Chancery of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
The several Members of the States
are sworn to be true to the Emperor
and to the Empire; and are said to be
Subjects of the Emperor, and of the
Sacred Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:35676:30"/>2. In matters of Religion, in all times,
the head of the State had the Supreme
direction, as it was said of <hi>Tiberius, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ûm
munere summum Pontificem summum
hominem esse.</hi> And the first Christian
Princes, before the Papal Tyranny
usurpt upon them, were always the
chief Pontifs, and receiv'd the Pontifical
Habit from that Colledge.</p>
            <p>But upon the Reformation in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
Anno</hi> 1555. both the Emperor and
Pope were excluded, and their Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Supremacy abrogated. In the point
of Religion, the Emperor was not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
as the Chief and Head of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
but as a party: for by joyning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, he made
their cause and concern his own. It was
therefore agreed and concluded, that the
States onely should determine in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion; and that with a tender
hand, in an amicable way onely.</p>
            <p>3. War and Peace are transacted in
the name of the Emperor; but in effect,
all is reserv'd to the States. He must
at the least have the consent of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:35676:30"/>Yet any Prince of the Empire may
levy Souldiers, may make Leagues and
associations without any bodies leave.</p>
            <p>4. For Jurisdiction, and the last Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
the Civilians say the Emperor is
<hi>fons omnis Iurisdictionis;</hi> but here it is far
otherwise.</p>
            <p>The Princes, in causes touching their
Life, their Honour, or their see, always
claim'd their Priviledge <hi>das fursten-recht</hi>
(they call it) to be try'd by their Peers
the Princes of the Empire.</p>
            <p>The common Pleas were tryed by
the Emperor, and attended his motion,
till by the increase of Suits, that Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was no longer Sufficient, the Judges
grew corrupt, and many other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
appearing, the States in their
Assembly at <hi>Franckford, An.</hi> 1489. or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
a place certain for the decision of
those ordinary causes; whereupon the
Imperial Chamber at <hi>Spires</hi> was erected.</p>
            <p>All the Process and Decrees of the
Court ran in the Emperors name, and
are under his Seal; and it is call'd <hi>Caesars</hi>
Court. But it is also call'd the Court of
the Empire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:35676:31"/>The Emperor onely named the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
by the States were the rest of the
Judges appointed; and the other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the Court by the Elector of
<hi>Mentz</hi> Arch-Chancellour of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
            <p>The States likewise execute the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.
They visit and reform the Court
by their Commissioners; and to these
visitors are the Appeals, not to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</p>
            <p>Yet some voluntary referenccs that
were made to the Emperor and his
Privy-Council, and to their Arbitration,
gave them opportunity of late to usurp
a Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>5. Taxes are all Levyed in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
Name; but in truth nothing of
that nature can be done without the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of the States. Nor is the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
trusted with the Money in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer;
the States keep it till it be
employ'd; they have their several Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suries.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the several Circles keep
their respective Money; sometimes a
publick Treasury is agreed upon, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35676:31"/>
one or more <hi>Pfenning-Meisters</hi> (Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Masters)
appointed. <hi>Anno</hi> 1495. They
ordered seven Treasurers, one to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by the Emperour, and six by the
States. These swear to the States. And
if any be by special Oath or obligation
bound to the Emperor or other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
State, he is uncapable of that trust.
These are accountable to the States one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>If the occasion for which the Tax
was rais'd be taken away, the Money
cannot be diverted to other uses, but
by the consent of the States.</p>
            <p>6. The chief Magistrates are, none of
them, made by the Emperor. The
Count Elector <hi>Palatine</hi> is Vicar or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
of the Empire, and has the
charge of it in the Emperors absence.
The Three Ecclesiastical Electors, who
are chosen by their Chapters, are of
course the Arch-Chancellours of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
The States appoint the (<hi>Reichs-Skak-Meister,</hi>
or <hi>Reichs-Psenning-Meister</hi>)
the Treasurer of the Empire. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they leave the general to be nam'd
by the Emperor, and the ten Circles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35676:32"/>
their several Directors or Counsel
for him.</p>
            <p>For the other particulars, as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
and care of Coyning Money,
the hearing and sending Ambassadours,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Emperour has no great matter
of advantage above the other States.</p>
            <p>On a common account, where the
concern is general the States must be
consulted; and nothing can be done
without their consent and approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The Electors are in possession, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
a particular Soveraignty in some
points of greatest moment. They are
the Trustees and Representative of the
whole Empire, in their Election of the
Emperor. And hereupon they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
likewise to loosen his power, or tye
it up short; and make what Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they please with him. And thereby
would assume to themselves more than
the other States will ever be content to
allow them.</p>
            <p>But the Emperour singly, besides the
name, and pomps, and empty Titles,
has very little of the substantial Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
entrusted with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:35676:32"/>The <hi>Investiture</hi> of the great <hi>fiefs</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to him. This is a Prerogative
goodly in show, and were of moment,
could he lay any conditions or charge
on the person invested; but nothing is
left to his will; he cannot deny, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
the lawful Heir. Nor does the Fee
for want of Heirs Escheat to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
but to the publick Patrimony.</p>
            <p>He grants <hi>Priviledges,</hi> where a third
person or the Publick is not injur'd.
He founds Universities, grants Fairs,
makes Denizens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
He Creates Kings, Princes, Dukes,
Marquises, Counts, Poet-Laureats, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He gives onely the bare Titulary ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of Prince, but not the qualifications;
he cannot make him capable to sit and
Vote amongst the other Princes of the
Empire.</p>
            <p>So that here the States are not subject
to that imposition which the <hi>Roman</hi>
Senate once suffer'd under <hi>Tarquinius
Priscus,</hi> who created an hundred new
Senators, to the end he might be sure of
a Court-party, by his Creatures, and
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35676:33"/>
have a majority of Votes in the House.</p>
            <p>In short, the <hi>Germans</hi> seem to have
observ'd the rule in Politicks, That he
who is the most high in name and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
should in real power be the least
considerable.</p>
            <p>Yet in the last age, the States gave
way to several innovations, which
prov'd of mischievous consequence af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It had anciently been the Custom for
the Assembly of the States, to send for
the Emperor to come to them upon
occasion; so</hi> Hincmar <hi>tells us of</hi> Charles
<hi>the Great,</hi> Rogatu ipsorum in Concilium ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niebat,
quotiescunque voluntas esset ut ad
eos veniret; similiter quoque quanto spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio
voluissent, cum iis consisteret, <hi>&amp;c. Ep.</hi> 3.
<hi>c.</hi> 35. Upon their Message to him, he came
to the Assembly, as often as they had a
mind he should come to them; and in like
manner he stayed so long with them as they
desired. <hi>And this custom continued, as
may be seen in</hi> Lehem. l. 7. c. 80. <hi>and
c. 113. till under</hi> Maximilian. <hi>And
then the States began to go to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:35676:33"/>This <hi>Maximilian</hi> likewise, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of sudden occasions that admitted
not delays, would now and then be
acting <hi>single,</hi> and usurping in several
particulars the power that of right
could only be exercised by the <hi>States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the States, <hi>An.</hi> 1500. to
take off these pretences, and prevent all
attempts of this kind, and partly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure,
for their own ease, substituted
in their absence a <hi>Committee,</hi> which they
call'd the <hi>Regiment,</hi> and the Members
<hi>Regents.</hi> This <hi>Regiment</hi> was an Epitome
of the whole Empire, and was endued
with all the powers and Soveraignty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>It consisted of Twenty persons, who
were chosen out of the several Orders of
the States; and took an Oath <hi>to be true
to the Emperor, and to the Sacred Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperor or his Proxie was their
President; but lest this might give too
great advantage to the Emperor, an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
was added, as a joynt-president
with the Emperor or his Proxie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:35676:34"/>No person of dependance on, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
obligation to the Emperor, was
capable of being a Member.</p>
            <p>The Emperor had no more Vote than
any one of the Twenty <hi>Regents;</hi> nor
could determine ought, unless the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
were for him.</p>
            <p>These were not simply to consult, but
had the execution also.</p>
            <p>This Constitution held for some years.
And then the <hi>Annual Assembly</hi> returned,
and resumed their power, and acted
again. But in case of sudden necessity,
left another expedient for the Emperor.
They constitute for him a Councel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of Eight persons, Four chosen by
the Electors, and Four by the other
States. These were sworn to be true to
the Emperor and to the Empire, <hi>Scweren
der Keyserlichen Majestat und dem heili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen
reichs getreu,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth coming to Reign,
he was upon the new Model immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately.
He restor'd the <hi>Regiment,</hi> but
the conditions altogether different.</p>
            <p>Now it consisted not of Twenty, but
Twenty two persons. He as Emperor
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35676:34"/>
would have Two Votes added; thereby
in effect to be Master of Five Votes;
Two as Emperor, One as President; One
for <hi>Austria,</hi> and One for <hi>Burgundy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The former <hi>Regiment</hi> might, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the old custom, send for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
to come to them. Now it was
order'd that <hi>Caesar</hi> might call them to
what place he had a mind.</p>
            <p>Formerly, if the Emperor came not,
they might proceed without him; now,
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth forbad them to make
Leagues and Allyances, or do ought in
his absence. The Oath was alter'd, and
the Members were only sworn to the
Emperor, and said to be the Councel of
the Emperor; whereas the former was
called the Councel of the Empire.</p>
            <p>In the former constitution, the Elector
in the name of the Empire subscribed
their Ordinances; here, with the Electors
subscription is joyned that of the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
in the name of the Emperor.</p>
            <p>In short, the former was constituted
by the States, and entrusted with their
power, to be a check upon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
this was formed by <hi>Caesar,</hi> to quiet
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35676:35"/>
the people, and entertain them with a
show; whilst he the more insensibly
made his advances to invade their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Rights, and usurp all the power
into his own hands.</p>
            <p>The next project in case of Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
was the <hi>Assembly</hi> of the Deputies.
This consisted of the Six Electors, Six
other Princes, and Two Cities; to
which were after added Four Princes
more. This continued till <hi>An.</hi> 1606.
with some effect. Afterwards it prov'd
of little consequence, Court-artifice
prevailing, and the <hi>Ferdinands</hi> found a
way to manage the <hi>Deputies,</hi> and render
them as unprofitable to the publick, as
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth had made the <hi>Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second <hi>Ferdinand</hi> called what
<hi>Deputies</hi> he knew would Vote for him,
the rest he excluded, and supplyed their
place with others, who he understood
were entirely at his devotion, as he told
my Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> Ambassadour with him,
<hi>An. 1621. Lundorp, Tom.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>Amongst these projects, may be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
the Councel of the Emperours
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35676:35"/>
Court, and the Privy-Councel. These
also, that they might show as if the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
had the interest in them, were at the
first sworn to the Elector of <hi>Mentz,</hi> as
Arch-Chancellour of the Empire. Which
Oath came after some time to be omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Thus we have seen that the Custom
of the Empire was to have a yearly As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly;
these at the end of their Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
always appointed the time and place
for their next meeting. If necessity for
them sooner, then was the Emperor to
call an Assembly extraordinary; which
happening frequently, the States for their
ease appointed the <hi>Regiment,</hi> and other
expedients.</p>
            <p>This gave a President for the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
to devise something of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which they might more easily
pervert to their own Arbitrary Interest
and advantage. If it have but the
name or resemblance, the people look
no farther; they see not into the trick
and secrets of it; they are led by the
appearance so long, till they are past re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
and no way is left them for a
retreat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:35676:36"/>And indeed the Emperors of the last
Age ceased to deal <hi>bonâ fide;</hi> the old
<hi>German</hi> honesty wore out of fashion.
And they no longer treated on the
square with their people.</p>
            <p>Artifice and juggle came in place:
and in the days of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to get a specious appellation, and be
named (forsooth) <hi>Reason of State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But more especially, since the Jesuits
there have refined upon the Court-so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistry,
and minc'd away all the old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of Morality and Conscience; for
the Jesuits could the worst of all other,
endure these same <hi>mixt Governments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They would have the <hi>Pyramid</hi> inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and the whole stress of things rest
upon one single leg, that their art might
play the more freely, and they the more
cleverly trip it down. This broad-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom'd
Monarchy, and Government foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the people, puts them to other
measures; a dose of poyson, or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
dagger, will not do the work.
They must here go about and about,
make slow approaches, ripen a Plot of
many years, and draw a long concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35676:36"/>
of Intrigue, ere they can think
to compass their design.</p>
            <p>When the Commonwealth has but
one neck, the Jesuit will have it under
his girdle; if not, one blow does the
feat, and his dexterity is admirable.</p>
            <p>Therefore in <hi>Germany</hi> the Jesuits have
left no stone unturned, for their part, to
bring all the Soveraign power from the
States to the Emperor. And to that
end, of late times the Emperor (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by their influence upon his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
or no, is not our enquiry) has em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
all the undue practises, and set
all engines a-work, to render the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Assembly useless, burthensome, and
odious to the people.</p>
            <p>On this foot, care has been taken that
some vexatious Tax should be the only
result and conclusion of every Session;
<hi>Aid against the Turk,</hi> was a constant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
pretence; Money the Head of
all his Proposals, Money the effect and
substance of all his Speeches. This af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
once adjusted, other Debates were
out of doors, <hi>Grievances</hi> not then lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be toucht upon, but all adjourn'd
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35676:37"/>
to another Session. Besides the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
devises to embroyl the States
amongst themselves, and turn all their
heat upon fruitless disputes and alterca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>In the second place, the Electoral
Colledge have not been too fair in their
respects to the Diet. These could be
content that betwixt <hi>Caesar</hi> and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
all the matters of State be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted.
And have sometimes according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
strecht a Text of the <hi>Golden Bull</hi> to
serve a turn; and collogued with him,
that he again might be complacent to
them; till that amongst them the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
patrimony and common right and
Prerogatives of the Empire become en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grost
in a few hands, and made a spoyl
to their unreasonable ambition.</p>
            <p>These Electors must every one, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his Hand and Seal, signifie their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to the Emperor, before he can sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
an Assembly of the States.</p>
            <p>They got to themselves the making
of the Emperor. And now in effect
the States cannot meet without their
order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:35676:37"/>They were wont to be reckoned six E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors,
to some purposes seven, now they
make eight; but before they fill up the
number of the <hi>Roman Decemviri,</hi> they
will remember their fate. These ten (as
<hi>Livy</hi> tells us) having got all the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority for a time into their
hands, that they might reign absolute,
<hi>took an Oath together never to call the
Common Councel.</hi> Yet their Tyranny
held not long. This cheat would not
down with the old <hi>Romans;</hi> but with a
general indignation they break over the
Forms and Captivity of the letter, for
that old Law in <hi>Homer,</hi>
               <q>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</q>
to free their Country from slavery, they
executed an <hi>unwarranted</hi> piece of Justice
upon these ten Usurpers, or <hi>Ten Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins,</hi>
as some body then call'd them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the States have not a little
been wanting to themselves, in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
of this their so ancient and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Prerogative. One principal
cause (amongst many others) has been
their differences about Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:35676:38"/>For the Protestants being sure to be
out-voted in the Dyet, think they can
barter with <hi>Caesar</hi> for better conditions.
And are therefore well enough content
that the yearly Assembly be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>In a word, the <hi>German</hi> Diet is still on
foot, rather incumberd, and clogged, and
puzled, than destroyed.</p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>France</hi> seems quite
antiquated and subdued; the Ghost
and shadow of the defunct has appeared
three or four times since <hi>Lewis</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth.
But to revive that Assembly in
its full and perfect vigor, requires a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
like the Resurrection.</p>
            <p>So that in effect, we may date the
demise of the Parliamentary Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in <hi>France,</hi> from <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh;
and the decay of that in <hi>Germany</hi> from
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth.</p>
            <p>It is in <hi>England</hi> onely that the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
generous, manly Government of
<hi>Europe</hi> survives, and continues in its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
lustre and perfection.</p>
            <p>Were there not something in that
saying of the Emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:35676:38"/>
               <hi>the French King is a King of Asses;</hi> yet
however that same <hi>legereté,</hi> on which
the <hi>French</hi> so value themselves, is but, in
plain <hi>English,</hi> a lightness of humour, by
the which they are easily piped into a
new mode of Government.</p>
            <p>But our <hi>English</hi> Ancestors have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been of a more steady principle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
more wise, and more weigh'd, than to
dance after their Politicks.</p>
            <p>The Reformation of Religion leaves
no room at our Court for Jesuitical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
so fatal to the <hi>Germans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor, on the other hand, have we yet
had any <hi>Swisse</hi> Guards, or <hi>Lewisses</hi> for
our Kings. Ours have still been true
<hi>English</hi> Original, no Copies of the
<hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> instead of being su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perannuated,
renews and recovers its
pristine strength, and athletick vigor, by
the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> with our many
other explanatory or declaratory Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.
And the <hi>annual Parliament</hi> is as
well known to our Laws, as ever it had
been famous amongst the Customs of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi>

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:35676:39"/>I have not formally answered many
Objectons that might be started; nor

            <p>Take all together, you may as easily

               <hi>And</hi> Flavius Vopiscus, in Aurel. Caes.
<hi>tells us, Aurelius Caesar</hi> dicebat, Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt

dicunt quod probandum sit; Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator

                  </gap>us Caesar</hi> was wont to say, Four
or five get together about the Emperor; all
their consult is, how to cheat him; what
they say, is to be Law; the Emperor, who
is shut up from other Counsel, never knows
the true state of things; but is forced to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35676:40"/>
understand just so much onely, as they tell
him; he makes Iudges, who the least of
all should be; turns out of Commission
those who ought to be the <hi>quorum;</hi> in a
word (according to <hi>Dioclesian's</hi> saying) the
Emperor, so good, so wary, and so too too
good, is bought and sold before his face.</p>
            <p>If then it be true, that he who is of
Royal Extraction, clad in Purple, and
called a King, is not always <hi>naturally</hi>
such; it was wisdom, certainly most sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
to find the means that might
correct, and (as it were) ensure <hi>Nature</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the impotence and Tyranny of
the Minion or Mistress which <hi>Tasso</hi>
mentions.</p>
            <p>And if the observation of <hi>Aurelius
Caesar</hi> be just, that <hi>Cabals</hi> are so <hi>pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi>
and that four or five persons who
get the Prince into their hands and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
shall abuse, and cheat, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
him to his face, in spite of all his
goodness, his caution, and Royal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues;
if, I say, these things be true, the
necessity of Parliaments cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.
<hi>Homer</hi> reckoned it <hi>barbarity</hi> in

that they left nothing of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

who kill'd <hi>Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Imperial power that began with
the <hi>Caesars,</hi> was onely <hi>Magnum Latro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinium,</hi>
one huge horrid oppression. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
Government, Martial Law, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
Nations, <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,
and made havock of the old Civil
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Britain, Gaul,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> all this
while, liberty, and a participation in the
Government, was the common right
and inheritance unalienable; the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Councel</hi> was the basis and hinge,
however the administration roul'd.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, when <hi>Germany</hi> gave us

            <p>About <hi>An. Dom. 800. Charlemain</hi> (or
<hi>Charles</hi> the Great) united <hi>France</hi> and

pire; all Histories are full of his Reign

            <p>The Nations round about submitted
and took Laws from him; and he sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
all again to the (<hi>ordinatum</hi>) the
Ordinance of Parliament. An <hi>annual
Parliament</hi> was then reckoned the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom,
and inviolable right of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>And thus the affairs of State procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and this Scheme of Government
continued in <hi>Germany,</hi> till the late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
divisions about Religion, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and embroyling the States, gave
way to the <hi>Austrian</hi> ambition, new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and Jesuitical artifice; so that the
Assembly of the States, at this day,
keeps on foot (indeed) but sick, heavy,
and unweildy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Court had much sooner
learnt the terms <hi>de proprio Motu, &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testate
absolutâ,</hi> by their neighborhood
and correspondence with the Pope at
<hi>Avignon.</hi> But so long as the <hi>English</hi>
Arms kept them in mind of their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35676:42"/>
it was no time for them to
think of ruling without a Parliament.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh had
sent home the English, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
with (<hi>Olivier le diable</hi>) his Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bars,
and his cut-throat devils, thought
no attempt too wicked for them. He
(forsooth) was <hi>hors du page;</hi> he wanted
not to be <hi>led,</hi> he was past an <hi>Infant;</hi> and
a lowd outcry he made against the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly,
clump-fisted, bumpkin Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
But when the <hi>bien publique,</hi> or
War for the publick good, hindred him
from bringing about his design open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and directly, he compast it, in effect,
by slighting the <hi>Militia,</hi> and laying his
project of a standing Army.</p>
            <p>In <hi>England</hi> we have also heard of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and Mistresses, and Cabals; and
have had unhappy Princes. But the
Laws and old Customs of the Land, the
generosity of the people, and the <hi>Genius</hi>
of the Nation, have still prevailed, and
been too strong for all their practises and
machinations.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Normans</hi> came to the

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35676:43"/>
 they began to forget on what
conditions they had entered. <hi>Conquest</hi>
was a short, a compendious Title, and
without intricacy. And now likewise
the Church-men were every where agog
for changing the Government both of
Church and State, into absolute Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.
But the best on't was, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
were visible and notorious. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
that the Temporal and Spiritual,
the Prince and the Prelatical Lord could
not agree who should be Supreme. Which
differences gave breath to the people,
and put into their hands an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to assert their ancient just Rights, and
bottom all upon the Parliament again.</p>
            <p>And now, since the <hi>Great Charter,</hi> and
<hi>Petition of Right,</hi> and the many other
declarations, what can threaten us?</p>
            <p>Neither the <hi>Gunpowder</hi> Treason, nor
the late more <hi>sacred</hi> invention of a <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned</hi>
Parliament, could take effect.</p>
            <p>No room is left amongst us for a stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Army, which enslaved the <hi>French.</hi>
And (our <hi>Franc-Archers</hi>) our Militia
continues after the old Model,</p>
            <p>Nor, with us, as in <hi>Germany.,</hi> is the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35676:43"/>
               <hi>Papist</hi> like to bear up against, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
our <hi>Protestant</hi> Votes in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
thereby to render the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
useless and unpracticable.</p>
            <p>And it may be hoped, we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so far give way, and be gull'd by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitical
artifice, to find <hi>another division</hi>
in Religion amongst us; that may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
their designs, and, under <hi>other names,</hi>
do their work as compleatly.</p>
            <p>You need not be caution'd to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
<hi>Plato</hi> the <hi>Divine,</hi> from <hi>Plato</hi> the
<hi>Philosopher.</hi> Poets and Divines, you
know, have a particular way of expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and give their thoughts a turn diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from that of other people. They
attribute every thing to God; though the
whole operation and train of causes and
proceedings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e never so natural and
plain before their face, the Images they
make are often taken in the grossest
sense, and worshipped by the vulgar; and
many times the Statesman is willing to
contribute to their Idolatry. Hence it
comes, that for the <hi>Persians, Zoroaster</hi>
was said to receive his Laws from <hi>Horo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masis;
Trismegistus,</hi> for the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:35676:44"/>
from <hi>Mercury; Minos</hi> for the <hi>Cretans</hi> from
<hi>Iupiter; Charondas</hi> for the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
from <hi>Saturn; Lycurgus</hi> for the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi>
from <hi>Apollo; Draco</hi> and <hi>Solon</hi> for
the <hi>Athenians</hi> from <hi>Minerva; Numa Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilius</hi>
for the <hi>Romans</hi> from <hi>Aegeria; Xa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molxis</hi>
for the <hi>Scythians</hi> from <hi>Vesta;</hi> and
all these as truly, as <hi>Mahomet</hi> had his
<hi>Alcoran</hi> from the Angel <hi>Gabriel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This sort of Doctrine went currant
enough whilst Monkery and Ignorance
sat in the Chair; but now in an Age of
History and humane Reason, the blind
Traditions go hardly down with us. So
that <hi>Iure Divino</hi> at this day makes but a
very litigious Title.</p>
            <p>Nor was it consistent with the brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Letter, to observe minutely how
long the remains of the <hi>Roman</hi> domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
continued amongst us; as, namely,
That the <hi>Roman</hi> was the only authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Language for judicial matters in
<hi>Germany,</hi> till the Reign of <hi>Rudolph</hi> the
first, about the year 1287. in <hi>England</hi>
till <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, in <hi>France</hi> till
<hi>Francis</hi> the First.</p>
            <p>But in Church affairs, that old mark
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35676:44"/>
of slavery is not yet worn off: the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Emperor will remit nothing, he
still holds his Vassals to the <hi>Roman</hi>
Tongue even in Divine Service; onely
in <hi>England,</hi> and where the Reformation
has prevailed, this, with the other ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances
of <hi>Roman</hi> bondage, are no
longer necessary.</p>
            <p>Nor is it proper in this general draught
to reflect on all the several steps, and
little dispositions to change, in each Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
As how sometimes a practice has
prevailed against the form and letter;
sometimes the form of words has been
necessary, but the practice obsolete.
The use in Commissions of the phrase,
<hi>pour en jouyr tant qu'il nous plaira,</hi> was
not known in <hi>France</hi> till <hi>Lewis</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh
tryed its vertue; which occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their Parliament, <hi>An.</hi> 1467. to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
that notwithstanding the clause
<hi>tant qu'il nous plaira,</hi> Offices should not
be voyd save only by death, resignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or forfeiture; as <hi>Pasquier</hi> in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherches</hi>
informs us.</p>
            <p>But peradventure, since it has been so
much controverted of late amongst us
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35676:45"/>
who are the <hi>Three States,</hi> and the word
occurring so frequently in the <hi>German</hi>
Tongue, you may expect some account
who they be that have the name of
<hi>States</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They express the word <hi>States</hi> in their
own Language, and call them <hi>Stands,</hi>
and <hi>Reich-stands,</hi> because, says <hi>Goldastus,</hi>
the Empire stands and rests upon them,
as upon its basis and pillars. <hi>Status Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii
dicantur, quod in illis, ceu membris,
id est, basibus &amp; columnis, ipsum Imperium
stet &amp; subsistat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Those are said to be <hi>Stands,</hi> who have
the right to sit and <hi>Vote</hi> in the common
Assembly of the Empire. <hi>Hi quidem

            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Polybius</hi> we have had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
account of mixt Governments,
where he calls those that represent the

Monarchical, the Aristocratical, and the
popular State <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
<hi>The three governing parts of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
So the King, the Senate, and
the <hi>Ephori</hi> at <hi>Sparta;</hi> the Consuls, the
Senate, and the Tribunes at <hi>Rome,</hi> were
there the <hi>Three States,</hi> and had each
their particular shares in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The like seems to have obtain'd in
<hi>France,</hi> under the names of the King, the
Peers, and the <hi>Third State.</hi> Nor did
the power of the Clergy, how great
soever otherwise, make any new distinct
Order, but they were mixt and inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with the other States; as their
Learned Archbishop <hi>Claude Seisselle</hi> in
his Treatise of the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy,
shows us.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Germany</hi> how the Government has
been shared, and who have had a right
of <hi>Voting</hi> in old times, we may learn
from what has before been cited out of
<hi>Tacitus;</hi> the <hi>Rex,</hi> the <hi>Principes,</hi> and
the <hi>Omnes,</hi> denote the <hi>Three States,</hi> who
had their several shares, and right of <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
in the Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:35676:46"/>The same distinction continued still
under the Western Empire. <hi>Hincmar,</hi>
at the yearly Assembly, or <hi>generale pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citum</hi>
under <hi>Charlemain,</hi> does compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
all under the terms of <hi>Seniores</hi> and
<hi>Minores.</hi> So that the Emperor, the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors,</hi>
and the Commons, seem to have
then been the <hi>Three States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Senior</hi> (which the <hi>Germans</hi> exprest in
their <hi>Ealdermen</hi>) we may suppose, was
a word grew currant in the <hi>Provincial,</hi>
or vulgar <hi>Roman</hi> about that time; and
afterwards was diversifyed into <hi>Sieur,</hi>
and <hi>Sire,</hi> and <hi>Sir,</hi> and <hi>Monsignior,</hi> and
<hi>Monsieur,</hi> and was ordinarily applyed to
Men in great Office. <hi>Cum</hi> Seniori <hi>urbis
nunciata fuissent,</hi> &amp;c. Seniores <hi>loci illius,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>Nihil per me feci, nisi quae mihi, a

sunt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tempore</hi> Senioris <hi>nostri,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ex
parte</hi> Senioris <hi>mei</hi> Caroli, &amp;c. These
and the like passages, in <hi>Gregory Turo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nensis,</hi>
may show the extent of the
word, and that the <hi>Seniores</hi> in <hi>Hincmar,</hi>
were the same with the <hi>Principes</hi> in <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus.</hi>
Nor did the <hi>Signiories</hi> become
Hereditary till <hi>Otho</hi> the first his Reign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:35676:46"/>But what most affected the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and proved of greatest conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in this affair, was the innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that hapned in <hi>Frederic</hi> the Third
his time: for whereas formerly a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
was wont to be issued out, for
summoning the Assembly, whereupon,
<hi>Delecti ex singulis Civitatibus,</hi> says <hi>Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moinus,</hi>
from every Town and City
were chosen the Burgesses and Citizens
to go their Representatives to the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly;
Now so many griev'd at the
charge, neglected the Proclamations,
that oftentimes the Assembly could not
proceed for want of a competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Members. Wherefore <hi>Frederic</hi>
let the Proclamations alone, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
thereof, sent particular Letters to
the several Towns; and henceforward
none took themselves obliged to attend,
who had not Letters directed to them.
Many of the poorer Towns were glad
to be excused, and private Gentlemen
left off going: so that within a little
time the Government was brought into
a few hands, and every day rendered
less and less popular. Those Cities that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35676:47"/>
preserved their share in the Government,
and right of <hi>Voting,</hi> by continuing to
send their Representatives to the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
are now therefore called <hi>Imperial
Cities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Although the Electoral Princes had
a name much sooner, yet were they still
one and the same State with the other
Princes, till under this <hi>Frederic,</hi> in the
Dyet at <hi>Francford, An.</hi> 1489. they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and became a particular Assembly,
and Voted severally, and from that
time got the name of a distinct State,
and form'd a new sort of an Aristocratie
by themselves.</p>
            <p>Yet all this while the Clergy did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
set up for a separate Order in the
Common-wealth, but always made a
mixt State with the Layety; mixt
they are in the Electoral State, and
mixt in that of the Princes, where the
<hi>Geistlicher</hi> and <hi>Weltlicher,</hi> Ghostly and
worldly (as they call 'um) together with
the Counts, Barons, and other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
make but one State. They have
indeed a particular Bench (<hi>die geistliche
Bank</hi>) to sit upon by themselves, save
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35676:47"/>
that the Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> and
Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> onely sit upon it
above them.</p>
            <p>Now whether we fix our Notion of
the <hi>Three States</hi> upon the Doctrine of
the Ancients, as delivered by <hi>Polybius;</hi>
or call them <hi>the States,</hi> who have a
<hi>right of Voting;</hi> The Emperour is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one of the <hi>States.</hi> Nor is it materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
that the ordinary stile and form of
words seem to imply the contrary: for
if the saying, <hi>Emperor and the States,</hi>
argues the Emperor himself to be none
of the <hi>States,</hi> by the same reason the
form so frequent in their <hi>Recesses</hi> or
publick Ordinances, <hi>chur fursten, fursten,
und Standen,</hi> that is, Elector-Princes,
Princes, and States, will exclude the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors,
and the other Princes also, from
being either of them <hi>States.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Form <hi>Emperor</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> does
no more prove him to be none of the
<hi>States,</hi> than with us the saying <hi>King</hi> and
<hi>Parliament,</hi> does imply, that the King
is no part of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>I shall not trouble you with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
what were the bounders of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strasia</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:35676:48"/>
and <hi>Newstria,</hi> or whether by the
devolution of this Western Empire, <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
was added to <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>France</hi> to
<hi>Germany.</hi> Or whether more properly
<hi>Charlemain</hi> be to be reckoned amongst
the <hi>French</hi> or the <hi>Germans.</hi> His having
been born at <hi>Ingelsheim,</hi> as most affirm;
or at <hi>Carolsburg</hi> in the upper <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as
many believe; and his speaking the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Tongue, with this testimony of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginhardus,
viz. Mensibus juxta patriam
linguam nomina imposuit; cum ante id
tempus apud Francos partim Latinis,
partim Barbaris nominibns appellaren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
Ianuarium appellavit</hi> Wintermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,
<hi>Februarium</hi> Horning, <hi>Martium</hi>
Lenkmonat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These, I say, are
urged by the <hi>Germans,</hi> as no mean Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
But these matters concern
not our enquiry.</p>
            <p>If you cannot reconcile the Emperor
his being somewhere said to be <hi>Sacri Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii
Minister,</hi> and elsewhere declared to
have no Superiour, <hi>Nisi Deum &amp; Ensem,</hi>
but God and the Sword; <hi>Bartolus</hi> tells
you, <hi>De verbis non curat jureconsultus.</hi>
The intention is to be regarded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:35676:48"/>
the words. The intention of the States
in that Declaration, <hi>An.</hi> 1338. was none other
than to exclude the wild pretensions of the
Pope; to deny a Forreign Jurisdiction, not to
confess or introduce any new subjection in
themselves: <hi>Limitata ex certâ causâ confessio
non nisi limitatum producat effecium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I cannot conclude without some reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on these frauds <hi>a la mode,</hi> the <hi>ruse</hi> and <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
which the <hi>French</hi> so loudly boast at this
day. <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh would not have his
Son learn more Latin than <hi>qui nescit dissimulare,
nescit Regnare.</hi> The old <hi>Romans</hi> had another
sort of Spirit; we are told in <hi>Livy, Haec Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana
esse. Non versutiarum Punicarum, neque cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditatis
Graecae-apud quos fallere hostem gloriosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us —dolo
quam virtute:</hi> 'tis like a <hi>Roman,</hi> to deal
openly and roundly; not to practice the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi>
Leger-de-main tricks, or <hi>Graecian</hi>
cunning, whose glory is to circumvent and by
fraud not vertue overcome an Enemy.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> at this day are commended
for the same style. <hi>Il procedere veramente Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio
regli affari publici, il negotiare saldo, e libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,
e senza artisicio, O duplicita; non masquerato,
non finto, ma sincero, e del tutto alieno da ogni
dissimulatione e fallacia.</hi> Their proceedings in
publick Affairs, (says our Author) is truly Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al;
they negotiate upon the square, frankly,
and without artifice, or double dealing, not
disguised, or upon the sham; but sincere, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35676:49"/>
every way far from all dissembling and tricks.</p>
            <p>And indeed the <hi>bugie</hi> and <hi>inganni,</hi> and little
<hi>Italian</hi> shifts, would better become Duke <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentine</hi>
and the petty Princes, than any Kingdom
or Commonwealth of true strength and solid
reputation.</p>
            <p>The <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the Sophistries
and State-pretences of this kind. However
furbisht up, and gloss'd over of late by our poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Brokers, were all stale cheats, and worn
out even in <hi>Aristotle's</hi> time.</p>
            <p>Thus have I hinted matters to you, and
onely toucht upon Heads, without anticipating
your reflections and applications. I have not
treated you like a stranger, but as one thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
informed before-hand, and to whom all
those difficulties are familiar, which I can one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discover at a distance. And after all, I must
fly from your judgment, to your good nature.</p>
