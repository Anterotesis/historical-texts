            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That I coped not with him voluntarily: nor thruſt my ſelf forward of my own accord, out of a deſire to be do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

<pb facs="tcp:13149:3"/>
and profitably ſpend my time, then in catching or kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Flyes. But be pleaſed to heare a ſtory, <hi>Reader,</hi> which put me on this poſture, and performing. And thus it was.</p>
            <p>About ſome two yeares ſince, as I remember, ſome of our Catholique Limitors, had beene roming and rambling in the Countrey, and brake into my pale ſecretly, at my Pariſh of <hi>Standford-Riuers</hi> in <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex:</hi> and according as commonly their cuſtome is, (that you may know of what companions Saint <hi>Paul</hi> entended, <hi>his Leading ſilly women captiues)</hi> fell in with ſome, one at leaſt, of the ſubordinate and weaker ſexe: indeauouring to make Proſelytes of my neighbours wiues. Now you know their ordinary <hi>onſets,</hi> with great <hi>Out-cries</hi> of <hi>Damned Heretickes, out of the Church. No Seruice: no Sacraments: no Miniſtery: no Faith: no Chriſt: no Saluation.</hi> Terrible Shawe-fowles to <hi>skarre</hi> poore Soules, that haue not the facultie of diſcerning Cheeſe from Chalk. Horrible affrights and mormolyceues, to put young children out of their wits, that cannot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh a viſnomie indeed from a viſour.</p>
            <p>So it fell out, that a neighbour of mine, with whom in this ſort they had beene tampering, became not a little diſmayed, and perplexed with theſe bug-beares of great names and thunderings in her eares; till it came at length vnto my knowledge what was done. I let her know, they were but ſcarr-crowes: meere words and wind, bragges and boaſtings, and ſo ſetled her diſquieted thoughts againe. But yet it ſeemeth, they left not ſo. The Diuell hath a name, <hi>Belzebub,</hi> the <hi>God of flyes,</hi> expreſſing his nature, like a flye, inſolent,
<pb facs="tcp:13149:3"/>
importune, preſſing on; though he fall off to day, hee will re-enforcce to morrow, though he faile to day, he will aſſay to morrow, and ſtill hope to preuaile at laſt. So <hi>Theſe,</hi> as <hi>He,</hi> came on againe, though euer by owle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. For they came to ſteale, and therefore feared <hi>blaunchers.</hi> I could not come to God-ſpeed, nor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front them.</p>
            <p>But this I did: When next you meete with theſe Romiſh Rangers, commend me to them, ſaid I vnto my neighbour. Tell them, I much deſire to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them. I was borne, &amp; bred, and brought vp, &amp; profeſſed in the Religion of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> which I hitherto haue thought to be the truth: held and taught as the truth: if I haue beene deceiued, and haue deceiued others, I am ſorry for it: my deſire is to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>profeſſe</hi> the <hi>Truth,</hi> to <hi>waue hereſie,</hi> to <hi>quit error,</hi> to goe out of <hi>ſchiſme,</hi> to finde out the <hi>true Church of Chriſt,</hi> and become <hi>a member</hi> of it; and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, by all poſſible meanes <hi>to ſaue my Soule.</hi> If then their intention be ſuch ſincerely, as they pretend it is, <hi>To ſaue Soules;</hi> they may doe a meritorious deed to come and ſaue mine, the rather, becauſe they may goe compendiouſly to worke, in gaining mee to the ſide, who am like enough to draw you, my Pariſhioners, with me, at leaſt to make you more ſeaſable, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe you would be for them.</p>
            <p>But it ſeemed <hi>canebam ſur dis,</hi> &amp; I beleeue, if the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made, as I think it was, they gaue no great credit to my words, or had leſſe hope of their <hi>performance.</hi> For the truth is, the moſt of theſe <hi>Limitors</hi> are but poore <hi>Ignaroes:</hi> take them out of their beaten paths,
<pb facs="tcp:13149:4"/>
they cannot hold pace.) Wherefore, ſeeing I could not tell where to finde them, and they would not finde me, where they might haue me: I thought to ſend af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them to know their mindes, to vnderſtand their opinions, and ſee what they would ſay, to winne mee vnto their <hi>Catholiqne faith. So</hi> I tooke pen and paper, and wrote, as I thought fit, three Propoſitions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing conformity vpon reſolution, to this effect, and I ſuppoſe, in theſe tearmes.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>If any Papiſt lining, or all the Papiſts liuing, can proue vnto me, that the preſent Roman Church, is eyther the Catholique Church, or a ſound member of the Catholique Church, I will ſubſcribe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>If any Papiſt liuing, or all the Papiſts liuing, can proue vnto me, that the preſent Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>is not a true member of the Catholique Church, I will ſubſcribe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>If any Papiſt, &amp;c. can proue vnto mee, that all thoſe points, or any one of thoſe points which the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>maintaineth againſt the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>were or was, the perpetuall Doctrine of the Catholique Church: the concluded Doctrine of the repreſentatine Church in any generall Councell, or Nationall approued by a Generall: or the dogma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall reſolution of any one Father, for 500. yeares after Chriſt, I will ſubſcribe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to theſe ſeuerally I ſet my name, which I did to try their ſufficiencies: or abate their inſolencies: and to ſettle the wauering vpon thoſe goodly pretenſes of <hi>Antiquity, Vniuerſality,</hi> and <hi>Conformity.</hi> I am ſure I come home to them, and touch them in their <hi>freehold,</hi> as they
<pb facs="tcp:13149:4"/>
claime it: I giue them ſcope enough to inſiſt vpon. If they can performe this, I will not eate my words. I make it now publicke, which I then ſaid in priuate, <hi>let them performe it, I will ſubſcribe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe three Propoſitions, thus conceiued, &amp; ſigned, I then deliuered vnto my neighbour, the partie that ſhould haue beene <hi>proſelyted:</hi> intreating her, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them vnto thoſe her <hi>perſwaders,</hi> if they came again, as ſhe thought they would. This ſhe promiſed, and at their next meeting, accordingly performed, within few dayes. I expected, I confeſſe, ſome great vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, and ſome mighty oppoſition, to purpoſe, in points of that Nature, which touched them ſo neere, and came vp to the head of their Catholique cauſe; and ſo began to compoſe my ſelfe againſt expected aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of ſome performance at leaſt. But many weekes, many months paſſed, eighteene at leaſt, and I heard no noiſe of thoſe <hi>Hereticke-quellers,</hi> my great Maſters, who ceaſe not yet to call for diſputation. At length, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much expectation, vpon the fifth of <hi>October</hi> laſt, the ſame partie premiſed, preſenteth mee at once with two ſeuerall preſents. The one, <hi>two ſheets of Paper,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in haſte, not fully out, with two ſeuerall hands. The Scribe was ſome puny-nouice in euery point of Scrib-ſhip. For neither could hee tell how to vſe or diſpoſe his points: nor yet how to ſpell his words. I haue the <hi>Originall</hi> by mee, to ſhew. Any man that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, will many times be to ſeeke, to make ſenſe, or Engliſh of it.

            <p>Marry he had a cleanly put-off for that, thus. Hee <hi>deſireth me at my going to</hi> London, <hi>to repaire vnto Maſter</hi> May <hi>his houſe</hi> (theſe are my friend <hi>A.

From him I haue it: that, <hi>Hee was not long ſince a Miniſter, but is now become a Catholique.</hi> In good time: through diſcontent perhaps, or ambition; or ſome ſuch ordinarie motiue of ſuch Turne-coates. My imployment thither, was for Satisfaction: if yet I had beene ſure thereof.

            <p>He hath <hi>collected</hi> together, out of <hi>C. W. B.</hi> and ſuch companions: and <hi>diſpoſed</hi> as it hapned, without order or method <hi>xlvii.</hi> ſeuerall propoſitions.

The reſt are partly left at libertie by the Church: not determined for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines either way. Many impoſed by him on the Church, are directly diſclaimed, abandoned, oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Church, and the flat contrary to them commended and commanded. And accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, practiſed, and maintained againſt oppugners. A maior part are the meere opinions, priuate fancies, peculiar propoſitions of priuate men: many of them diſclaimed by the very Authors: ſome falſely impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Authors: ſome raked together out of the lay-ſtals of deepeſt Puritaniſme, as much oppoſing the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> So that whatſoeuer is in this <hi>Gagger,</hi> is, or childiſhly fancied, or ridiculouſly miſtaken, or wilfully peruerted, or ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derouſly imputed, or maliciouſly propoſed, or ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guouſly conceiued, or not iuſtified any way: as may

euidently appeare in the particulars in my anſwere enſuing: In which,</p>
            <p>Whatſoeuer is to be owned by the Church; as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued, and tendred, and ſubſcribed in the authoriſed <hi>Doctrine</hi> or <hi>Practiſe</hi> thereof, is by mee iuſtified fully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and ſhall be maintained againſt his betters, as not contrary to Antiquitie, in the Tradition of the <hi>Church,</hi> much leſſe vnto <hi>Scriptures</hi> in our <hi>owne Bibles.</hi> What is inuolued by him malitiouſly, to procure enuy to the ſide, is explicated and aſſerted to the proper te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, and termes, it is ſhewed how farre the Church of England reſolueth, where, and what things are left free and vndetermined, for men to hold with them or againſt them. Priuate opinions, are left vnto their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and Abettors, olde enough, and able enough to ſpeake for themſelues: In a publique cauſe (as is, the Faith of Gods Church) peculiar intereſts, that I know, haue no ſuch ſhare, at leaſt ouer-awing, as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund vndertaking againſt opponents.</p>
            <p>In anſwering of whom, to come vnto my courſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued with him, which I thought fit in conueniency to let the Reader vnderſtand, for my owne excuſe, and iuſtification, I haue gone along with <hi>him,</hi> cap a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pee, and point per point: firſt, for his <hi>Scriptures,</hi> both <hi>expreſſe</hi> and <hi>to be ſeene;</hi> then, for his Fathers, that <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the ſame,</hi> that is nothing to purpoſe, as little as his <hi>Scriptures</hi> did, as I could finde them quoted, or could gueſſe at them, by imagining where they mought be probably ſpoken withall, or where I could remember to haue ſome time left them.

Proſelytes, ſo they can make a dumbe ſhew with ſcoring vp Fathers, doe not much trouble themſelues with caring, where or what they ſay.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt point is, an excuſe of ſome negligence, or at leaſt ouerſight in the very title of the Pamphlet. For whereas the refutation of the errors of the Proteſtants, ſo vaunted of, was vndertaken to be out of expreſſe texts of their owne Bibles: this indetermined generality may amuſe and puzle the Reader, who will be to ſeeke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion, out of which Engliſh Bible, the alleaged paſſages are extracted. Well thought vpon, and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</hi> Bonum factum, <hi>had hee beene ſo punctuall and preciſe in his Texts of Fathers,</hi> to bee ſeene <hi>for</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, <hi>God knoweth what oftentimes: in none of which, the editions are ſpecified; being many, diuers, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. In many of which, no place deſigned: or but at rouers and randon, or els falſly, and not to purpoſe. Some</hi> aduice <hi>would haue beene thought vpon here: Bibles are of more ſpeciall care, I grant. Therefore as this was neceſſarily done: ſo in diſcretion that ſhould not haue beene left vndone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And yet, what ſuch necesſsity; to tell the Reader, out of which Engliſh Bible they were alleadged? Great doubtleſſe: For</hi> Qui bené diſtinguit bene docet. <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land hath brought forth within theſe few yeares paſt, to the number of twenty ſeuerall Bibles. I grant that, perchance to the number of twenty, and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, in many ſeuerall impreſsions, and editions, in folio: in quarto: in octauo: as many hath Rome, and Lions, and Antwerpe, and Paris, and other places, nay farre moe, brought forth ſeuerall ſorts of the vulgar
<pb facs="tcp:13149:11"/>
Latine, and ſent them abroad into the world. It was very vnaduiſedly therefore done of</hi> Bellarmine, Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, Vaſquez, <hi>and the reſt of our Controuerſors, not to giue vs a ſpeciall direction vnto that preciſe Edition which they followed, as you haue done for yours, of 1615.</hi> in quarto, by Robert Barker: <hi>that we might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe our ſelues, in peruſing Controuerſies, vnto the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by them followed, the time, place, and quantity thereof. Surely a materiall and moſt remarkeable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, Catholikes could neuer haue</hi> peruſed this treatiſe with profit; <hi>without this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh but the Proteſtants ſorts of Bibles, are ſarre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent one from another. Meane you in forme? So are yours: but then you enlarge beyond art and skill. There are but fiue ſeuerall forms of Bibles at the moſt. You mean in matter: For the tranſlations differing one from an other. Then in plaine Engliſh,</hi> you lye. <hi>Name me ten of this twenty if you can. Some different Tranſlations there haue beene of late, but authorized I know but two: The Biſhops as they call it, and this laſt which hath perchance beene printed in ſeuerall formes, twenty and twenty times, but without diuerſity in the Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that you might as well haue directed your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Reader to 1614. 1616, or any other yeare, as well as 1619. by</hi> Robert Barker.</p>

drinking his blood. His very Diſciples, ſuppoſing as you doe, that he meant they ſhould eate his Fleſh, as they did the Fiſhes, or vſed to eate the Paſchall Lambe, were here it offended. Our Sauiour vnderſtanding this their ſcandall, replyeth in theſe words, according to your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Authenticall edition,</hi> Hoe vos ſcandaliſat? ſpiritus eſt, qui viuificat, caro non prodeſt quicquam: verba, quae ego locotus ſum vobis, ſpiritus, &amp; vitaſunt. <hi>You remember an allegation you brought out of</hi> S. Paul? If theſe things be hidden, they are hidden vnto thoſe that periſh. <hi>I put it to you, if this be obſcure, it is obſcure to him that will not ſee, or to him who iuſtly God hath abandoned and giuen ouer. Nothing can be more direct and plaine, then that our Sauiour telleth them, his ſpeech of eating his fleſh, was Sacramentall: not carnally but ſpiritually to be vnderſtood. This is it, ſaith</hi> Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, <hi>which he meaneth:</hi> You muſt conceiue of me ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually: <hi>For he that taketh this carnally, is not benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereby, nor getteth any good therewith. It was a carnall thought to make a doubt, in what ſort he came downe from heauen: And to ſuppoſe him the ſonne of</hi> Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph: <hi>And to diſpute, how can he giue vs his fleſh to eate? All theſe were carnall thoughts: which muſt be myſtically and ſpiritually vnderſtood.</hi> The words that I ſpeake vnto you, are ſpirit and life; <hi>that is, are diuine and ſpirituall, hauing nothing carnall, not any infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or conſequence naturall: But are freed from all ſuch neceſsity as this, ſurpaſsing legal tyes and conditions below; conteining another ſenſe, and meaning, then is literally ſet downe. If this be not an important paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, goe gagge</hi> Saint Chryſoſtome, <hi>and other ancient
<pb facs="tcp:13149:16"/>
Fathers that put this ſaying into the Proteſtants mouths: as plaine a text of Scripture as, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God made heauen and earth. Plaine or obſcure, yet to no purpoſe. For, it</hi> affirmeth nothing leſſe then that which they pretend to prooue thereby. <hi>And what is that? are you aware of it? That the fleſh of Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing. It is plaine the fleſh profiteth nothing. It is plaine, the paſſage is of Chriſts fleſh: Therefore the fleſh of Chriſt profiteth nothing. This you ſay is</hi> abſurd. <hi>And ſo ſay I: nay I adde, this is impious. For,</hi> his Fleſh is life; <hi>and</hi> giueth life, <hi>and therefore nothing</hi> profiteth <hi>ſo much as that. If the paſſage be not of Chriſts fleſh, of what is it, can you tell? I beleeue you cannot. But your inſtructors can tell you, they would haue it taken, that</hi> Carnalis intelligentia non prodeſt. <hi>Good: And ſo ſay I. But</hi> Intelligentia cuius? <hi>of a certaine</hi> indiuiduum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum, abſtrahendo <hi>from all ſubiect, or obiect whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer? Idle, and abſurd. But</hi> Carnalis intelligentia <hi>of that which muſt bee taken ſpiritually. And ſo of this place: and principally, and primarily of this place, as giuing occaſion vnto this Axiome of our Sauiour: The fleſh profiteth not. This is not vrged by</hi> Peter Martyr, <hi>or any Proteſtant, againſt</hi> Hoc eſt corpus meum, This is my body: <hi>but againſt</hi> This is my body by this means; <hi>This way, that is, by Tranſubſtantiation.

            <p>
               <hi>It is eaſily granted you by the Proteſtant, and you might haue made your friends of this aduice that way.</hi> That it is doubtleſſe better to explicate an obſcure paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage by one that is cleere, then one that is cleere by a

                  <hi>at Moſes, and all the Prophets, hee expounded vnto them all the ſcriptures, the things concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, before that they could vnderſtand them:</hi> Firſt, the anſwere is the ſame which ſerued for the former, that the things which they vnderſtood not, were but ſome Scriptures. Now it followeth not, that all are hard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome were. Secondly, they were Prophecies, and ſo obſcure till their accompliſhments. Thirdly, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of one ſubiect, all; the Meſſias. Fourthly, the Caſe is altered with them now: they are now eaſie that were then hard, and our Queſtion is of Scripture at this day to men now adayes, not of ſcripture then, to men then liuing. I adde farther, they are <hi>fooled</hi> for <hi>their ſlowneſſe of heart:</hi> that is, not ſo much for a diſ-ability to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe things there ſpoken of, as for diſ-proportion in their affection; or diſ-attention rather vnto thoſe things, not ſo obſcure or difficult of themſelues, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering the times then: <hi>The Shepheard being ſmitten: the ſheepe ſcattered;</hi> and meeting with thoſe occurrences which they looked not for, in the fulfilling of their Hopes: <hi>wee hoped it was he, that ſhould haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the kingdome of Iſrael,</hi> ſo that a cloud of humane darkeneſſe and diſheartnings were at that time caſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their affections and vnderſtandings. And if at ſome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13149:27"/>
time I be ill-diſpoſed to any buſineſſe, it is no argument I am ſo alway; or ſhould totally be excluded from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling therewith. And laſtly this their <hi>ſlowneſſe,</hi> was but partiall: to vnderſtand <hi>ſomething,</hi> of one particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Which obſcurity, if in the Subiect it ſelfe, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to obſcurity vniuerſall.</p>
               <p>But yet further to this point: This fellow came forth to quarrell, not to plead for naked and bare truth: elſe would he haue dealt ſincerely and ingenuouſly, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in propounding what the Proteſtants hold, which he doth not: but alſo in not belying the text, as hee doth. For is it found in our Bibles, or in any Bible, <hi>Hee expounded vnto them all the Scriptures?</hi> or, <hi>Hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto them, in all the Scriptures, the things that concerned himſelfe?</hi> Thus I finde it, and not otherwiſe. For in this there is a ſenſe: in that other there is none. So that the <hi>Holy ghoſt</hi> is made to ſpeake plaine non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, to fit a turne for a Catholique cauſe. This may ſtand, and yet the Proteſtants aſſerſion be not infeebled, <hi>He expounded vnto them in all the ſcriptures, the things concerning himſelfe.</hi> For they doe not deny, but that <hi>ſome</hi> things are hard. That other cannot ſtand. For it implieth, that <hi>all</hi> things are hard. So we haue obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a pretty niggling tricke of a falſe knaue: a ſmall word, <hi>(In)</hi> left out, to marre all. For with <hi>In</hi> the text is for this, and no more, <hi>Some things in Scripture needed expoſition,</hi> and therefore were hard. But without <hi>In,</hi> though there be no Senſe (but what ſimple Proſelyte attendeth to that?) the implication is, <hi>All Scriptures need Interpretation,</hi> and ſo are all <hi>hard;</hi> which the good Catholique beleeueth <hi>not</hi> himſelfe; dareth not auouch; yet faine would haue his nouice take it ſo, to traduce
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13149:27"/>
the tenent of the Proteſtants, that <hi>ſome Scriptures are open and eaſie.</hi> Thus in the very in-ſteppe of his ſtolen pamphlet, he belyeth the Proteſtant for his opinion: abuſeth the Scripture to bolſter his Forgery: and yet for all that, fighteth onely with his owne fancy, as dogges by moone-light barke at their owne ſhadowes.</p>
               <p>To your queſtion then inferred vpon the premiſes, I <note place="margin">How then are Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo eaſie to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the vnlearned, when the Diſciples themſelues vnderſtood them not, till firſt they were expounded vnto them?</note> anſwere, firſt, <hi>As eaſie to be vnderſtood of the vnlearned</hi> now, as of them then, who were none of the Learned ones at that time: and had incident impediments at that time.

For the commentaries vpon the Epiſtles, extant vnder Saint <hi>Hicromes</hi> name, be none of his, but are the Collections of <hi>Pelagius</hi> the Hereticke; as not Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants ſay, but Papiſts of name and note: <hi>Catharme, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenſis, Pererius, Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Victorius Marianus:</hi> Such an aduocate we neede not enuie our aduerſary; Much good may <hi>Pelagius</hi> the Heretickes teſtimony doe him. But let him paſſe for Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> there is not any thing to purpoſe ſpoken by him. That which he ſaith is this: He had ſtudied the Scriptures much and long, had conference with diuers learned men all his time, about the ſenſe thereof, and had purpoſely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken a iourney vnto <hi>Didymus</hi> at <hi>Alexandria, vt ab eo in ſcripturis omnibus quae habebam dubia ſciſcitarer: Therefore,</hi> what? Firſt this: <hi>Didymus,</hi> at leaſt, vnderſtood all ſcripture; or how could he reſolue all the doubts of ſcripture? what needed <hi>Hierome</hi> to haue gone ſo long a iourney vnto him? therfore, <hi>ſcripture, al of it, is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</hi> Secondly, vnto <hi>Hierome,</hi> all ſcripture was not hard: <hi>he propoſed vnto him the doubts</hi> he had: which implyeth, they were not infinite, not all ſcripture ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13149:30"/>
or doubted of: therefore thirdly, this proueth the Proteſtant opinion true, that the Scriptures are ſome of them eaſie enough to be vnderſtood</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſt. Ep. 119. cap.</hi> 21. ſaith ſomewhat <note place="margin">Saint Aug.

For of one and the ſame place there may be moe ſenſes then one: yea, euen literall ſenſes, and intended by the holy Ghoſt: ſo that knowing one ſenſe, perhaps prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and naturall, he may be ignorant of the other: and thus all Scripture may be hard.</p>

But when a man hath once reſolued his Faith in them, without which no man can liue well and godlily, thoſe men that will goe forward with greater proficiency, ſhall meete with ſo many things in ſuch wiſe ſhadowed with myſticall meanings: ſo great proofe and depth of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome therein couched, not onely in the words which ſet forth the things vnto vs; and to our vnderſtanding: but alſo in the things vnderſtood. Inſomuch as that aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtudents, of pregnant wit, of vnwearied pains, doe find it verrified in themſelues here, which the ſame ſcripture hath in a certaine place, Sirac. 18. 7.

               <p>This was the doctrine once euen of the Roman Church: For Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> vpon the 6. of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi>

The holy Scripture is Meate in the more obſcure places, becauſe in the expounding thereof it is broken as it were, and in chewing ſwallowed.

               <p>The controuerted poynts are of a larger and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour alloy: of them a man may be ignorant, without any danger of his ſoule at all.

the Church. And they haue reaſon for it enough, ſeeing Gods Word and the ancient practiſe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, that is both <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Iudge,</hi> are both for them: In the name of the Church of England, I will be tried thereby, and maintaine it againſt all Papiſts liuing.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13149:42"/>
much leſſe againſt Scripture. This is ſomewhat, in your opinion, but that which is the thing intended indeede, is this which followeth in <hi>Irenaeus: Et ſi quibus de aliquâ modicâ quaeſtione diſceptatio eſſet, nonne oporteret in antiquiſsimas recurrere Eccleſias, in quibus Apoſtoli conuerſati ſunt, &amp; ab ijs de praeſenti quaeſtione ſumere quod certum &amp; re liquidum eſt?</hi> Thus hee queſtioneth: I anſwere affirmatiuely, yes. No doubt we ought for reſolution in poynts of doubtfull controuerſie, relye vpon that deciſion of the eldeſt Churches. Doe we refuſe this triall good Sir <hi>Gagger?</hi> Where you will, in what poynt you will, I vndertake thus to iuſtifie the Church of England, name you the Controuerſie, one or moe; and maintaine the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary if you can or dare. The queſtion is not with <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> what muſt be Law, but how the Law is to be expounded and interpreted. Scripture the Law, and Tradition the Interpretation: that is, the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall <hi>praxis</hi> of the Church, to expound the doubtfull texts of Scripture.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Irenaeus</hi> proceedeth farther than ſo, it will be ſaid: For, <hi>What if the Apoſtles had left vs no wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at all? Nonne oportet ordinem ſequi Traditionis, quam tradiderunt ijs, quibus committebant Eccleſias?</hi> Farther indeede, but to no purpose; this is vpon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: <hi>If it had been ſo;</hi> which is not ſo, nor could be ſo. Secondly, it followeth not, that becauſe if God had not giuen Iſraei a Law, it is probable hee would haue continued his former courſe with <hi>Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> and the <hi>Patriarchs:</hi> therefore, when he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them his Law, they were ſtill to looke for imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13149:43"/>
or Angelicall Reuelations, as before. No more is it conſequent to reaſon, pietie, or <hi>Irenaeus</hi> intent, that albeit, if no Scripture had beene written, onely Tradition muſt haue beene followed: therefore, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being written, wee ſhould, as otherwiſe addreſſe our ſelues vnto Tradition. But thirdly, wee come home to poynt: Shew vs any thing tendred by thoſe <hi>Eccleſiae antiquiſsimae,</hi> to be belieued, and obſerued, and ſee if wee reſpect it not as well, and as much as you. Till you ſhew vs ſuch Traditions, leaue your pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting idlely at randome, touching worth and weight, and vſe, and authoritie of Traditions.

For it was in a knowen Tongue: But to execute the Prieſts Office, was, <hi>The Cuſtome.</hi> What is that to Seruice in an vnknowen Tongue? It is now a part of the Prieſts Office to ſay Seruice; it was not then, but to offer Incenſe, or Sacrifice. <hi>They had a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</hi> Speake man; what to doe? what was their Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome?

I will put a Caſe. Suppoſe <hi>A.

No more then if a Gypſie ſhould cant vnto her in Pedlers French; becauſe there is a wall or two, or ſome other partition that diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her and him aſunder: muſt it not be ſo?

In the Temple at <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> where this accident was, that is thus remembred by Saint <hi>Luke;</hi> The Prieſts, both of the City and of the Country, ſerued by courſes in their ſeuerall moneths; not ſingular: for they were many thouſands, and had manifold employments in that ſeruice; but as they were deſcended from the XXIIII Founders of ſo many ſeuerall Courſes, all of one Linage and Family in a Courſe. Theſe ſeuerall XXIIII Courſes were firſt of all inſtituted, as appeareth in the Scripture, by King <hi>Dauid;</hi> and ſo continued till the Captiuity of <hi>Babylon:</hi> and after the Captiuity, being reſtored, to the deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Iewiſh State. <hi>Zachary</hi> was of the courſe of <hi>Abia;</hi> in ranke the VIII. The Prieſts ſeruice in the Temple was diuers, and different euery day; who ſhould performe what ſeruice in his courſe, was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and aſſigned by Lot. It fell to <hi>Zachary</hi> to burne Incenſe; as to others to offer Sacrifice: Now the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> had diuers diuiſions; as wee haue in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13149:53"/>
our Churches; Iſles, Chauncels, Reueſtries: Theſe were ſeuered by Vayles, Trauerſes, or Walles. The firſt was the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> or <hi>moſt holy Place:</hi> No People or Prieſt went in thither at all, but onely one, once a yeere; and no oftner then once that one day, the high Prieſt, and no other man. The ſecond was called the <hi>holy Place;</hi> the Altar of Incenſe ſtood there, whereat the Prieſts offered Incenſe vnto God in their Courſes, as <hi>Zachary</hi> here did, and nothing elſe; neither reading the Law, nor expounding of it, nor teaching the People, nor praying with them, nor ſaying any deuotions for them: it was no Cuſtome, or part of Seruice there.</p>
               <p>A third diuiſion was, <hi>atrium ſacerdotum,</hi> the body of the Church, into which none came, but onely Prieſts; and they to offer Sacrifice onely: The People came not ſo high, but into a fourth Court, <hi>atrium populi,</hi> or <hi>mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorum,</hi> in which they were praying at that preſent. So betwixt the place in which <hi>Zachary</hi> offered Incenſe, which was ſeuered by a vayle, and that place in which the People prayed, there was ſome diſtance: what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell if the People could not <hi>heare him?</hi> But as is tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, they needed not: for he was not to read, expound, or ſay any part of Seruice within, but onely to burne Incenſe, and no more. There were that taught them beſide, they did it in the place for the purpoſe; in the Peoples Court, and in that tongue which the People vnderſtood. So our Sauiour taught in the Synagogues, and in the Temple, being vnderſtood; and <hi>Moſes</hi> was read in the ſame forme and Language, that euery one vnderſtood. If it had beene added, that the People were praying in Latin, Greeke, or in ſome other exoticke

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd yet Saint <hi>Peter</hi> denied Chriſt. Dare you deny that? Belike, in your opinion, and new diuinitie, a man may deny Chriſt, and his faith not fayle: <hi>Turne Turke,</hi> and his faith not faile: onely, <hi>turne Protestant</hi> and his faith faileth. But wee muſt hold it howſoeuer: for it is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our owne Bible, Luke 22. 3. I haue prayed for thee that thy faith faile not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Your Proſelites may know you are an Empoſtor: That propoſe it in theſe words, ſo oppoſite to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and euent. That leaue it ſo ſuſpence, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. Saint <hi>Peters</hi> faith fayled, after this very prayer and aſſurance: and yet Chriſt obtained what hee did pray for. <hi>God heard him euer,</hi> how can you reconcile this?</p>
               <p>Your Maſters conſider Saint <hi>Peter</hi> two wayes, euen in this prayer made by our Sauiour for him, as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man, as a publique perſon: or as they loue to ſpeake, <hi>Head of the Church.</hi> As a priuate perſon, Chriſt did pray for him, that though his faith fell <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally</hi> for a time, it yet might not faile <hi>eternally,</hi> and for euer; as <hi>Iudas</hi> failed, and fell: and hee was heard in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:13149:57"/>
that he prayed for. <hi>Peter</hi> denied, but repented: hee recouered after his fall, and perſeuered vnto the end. <hi>Our Sauiour ſaid not to him, thou ſhalt not deny mee; but, That thy faith fayle not: and that his faith did not eternally fayle, it was out of his ſpeciall fauour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and care of him,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome hom. 83. in Math.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the prime, true, and literall meaning of the Text, euen in the opinion of your owne Partiaries: that Chriſts prayer was perſonall for Saint <hi>Peter:</hi> reſtrained vnto Saint <hi>Peter</hi> alone: which being ſo firſt ſetled and acknowledged, <hi>Peter</hi> may be ſaid in a ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary ſenſe, to ſuſtaine the perſon of the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church: in which ſenſe many, and they no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, doe vnderſtand it. And ſo his <hi>Faith,</hi> that is the <hi>Faith</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> fayled not either <hi>totally</hi> or <hi>finally,</hi> no not in the greateſt eclipſe that euer was: becauſe Chriſt was euer heard in that which he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for: and he prayed for the Church.</p>
               <p>The refiners of Popery, the quinteſſenſe of villany, the Ieſuites, haue inuented a third ſenſe to fit the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe more than the former. This promiſe was made, ſay they, to <hi>Peter,</hi> not perſonally, but as Pope. And therein was inferred, thereby aſſurance made that the Pope neuer did, neuer ſhould, neuer could maintaine, decide, hold, belieue any thing againſt Faith. A thing not heard of but out of ſuch mouthes, a late dayes. Falſe in euent, for their faith hath failed; totally, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, vtterly for euer. Falſe according to themſelues, and their other reſolutions. For <hi>Peter</hi> was not Biſhop, much leſſe Pope, when our Sauiour Chriſt prayed for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:13149:58"/>
him: inſomuch as by inchoation: when hee denied Chriſt, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> And good reaſon for his ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo: leſt his ſucceſſours might fall into the ſame predicament. His principality in and ouer the Church, was not inueſted in him, vntill after our Sauiours Reſurrection. Thus hee, <hi>de Rom. Pontif.</hi> 4. 8. therefore hee did not pray for him as Pope. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> contradicteth himſelfe: and is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his companions. Therefore this prater gagleth hee knoweth not what, againſt his owne rules, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Maſters.</p>
               <p>As alſo out of <hi>Matth. 16. 18. The gates of Hell shall not preuaile againſt it. It?</hi> What? Saint <hi>Peters Faith.</hi> Was the Church therefore built vpon Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Faith? Take heede of that. <hi>It,</hi> is the <hi>Church;</hi> not his <hi>Faith,</hi> nor his <hi>Perſon:</hi> nor his <hi>Papacy.</hi> But let it, for once, be his <hi>Faith.</hi> I anſwere, there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>preuayling</hi> againſt. Firſt, <hi>to ouercome:</hi> So <hi>Ioſua</hi> in fight, preuayled againſt <hi>Amalec,</hi> by the ſigne of the Croſſe, rather than the ſword. Secondly, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayling againſt, to <hi>deſtroy.</hi> So did <hi>Saul</hi> preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſame <hi>Amalec.</hi> The Gates of Hell did not preuayle againſt <hi>Peters</hi> Faith, to vndoe it. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lapſed, hee recouered: and mightily preuayled againſt them. They did preuaile againſt it, to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him: For he forſwore and denyed his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. The Faith of <hi>Marcellinus</hi> and <hi>Liberius</hi> fayled: but they recouered as Saint <hi>Peter did.</hi> The Faith of <hi>Honorius,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> 12 fayled: happely hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canted before his death: and ſo his Faith did not fayle finally: But <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. liued and dyed in his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13149:58"/>
                  <hi>Faith;</hi> that is, in his Sinne: and ſo Body and Soule went to the Diuell. Saint <hi>Peters Faith</hi> fayled one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a time: Of this ſpeake the Proteſtants, <hi>His Faith fayled.</hi> Saint <hi>Peters</hi> faith did not finally or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recouerably fall. Thus intended our Sauiour in that ſaying; <hi>I haue prayed that thy Faith fayle not.</hi> But, Sir, it mattereth not much what became of his Faith: His Perſon is the thing to be ſtood vpon: his Power, Principality, Papall Prerogatiues, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therein; this, I trow, is ſo cleare in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, no great neede <hi>to fortifie it</hi> by or from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and yet I maruaile why, if ſo cleare, there, wee haue ſo few Texts of holy Scriptures for it: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two Texts; nay ſcarcely that: For one of theſe is <hi>cleare</hi> for another thing. And againe, whatſoeuer you vaunt of Fathers, needeleſſe to be brought, it is more than preſumption, you had not one Father to fling at this Faith, not fayling: For when you haue them, you ſpare them not.</p>

For ſo Saint Peter alſo ſhould be Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; for he was Pope, and the very firſt of all the Popes.</hi> So your good Goſſips long ſince reaſoned in this point, but idely all, and you more: Though the words be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and perſonall; <hi>Man of ſinne:</hi> and <hi>Sonne of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> yet followeth not, that the ſubiect is one Perſon; they may denote a body: For any Corporation, though collected out of Pluralities, is a <hi>totum,</hi> and ſo but one, and ſo ſingular in it ſelfe. The Prophecies of <hi>Iacob</hi> for <hi>Iudah,</hi> and his other Sonnes, runneth preciſely in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and perſonall termes; yet your ſelfe, I thinke, are not ſo ſenceleſſe, as to faſten them all vnto the Perſons of the Patriarchs. The <hi>Man of ſin,</hi> is perſonall in termes, I grant, but the deſignation may be a collectiue vnity; a Corporation, a Succeſſion. A <hi>ſinfull man, a wicked ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration;</hi> an impious body, and an Antichriſtian State. You haue read in the <hi>Pſalmes, That the man of the Earth be no more exalted againſt them:</hi> And againe; <hi>For man goeth about to deuoure me.</hi> Some priuate man the Prophet meant by your reaſon; no Company, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination, or ſociety of men: For, The words <hi>Man,</hi> and <hi>Man of the Earth,</hi> being ſingular, doe plainely proue, that he could not intend any priuate man: this is your reaſon for the Pope.</p>
               <p>As for Saint <hi>Peters</hi> being then a limbe of Antichriſt, becauſe he was <hi>Pope,</hi> and the firſt of <hi>Popes;</hi> I anſwere, <note place="margin">For ſo Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould then be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt: for he was Pope, and the very firſt of Popes.</note> that he was none of Antichriſts members, becauſe he was <hi>firſt:</hi> For the Spring is good and wholſome, where the ſtreame is muddy, bitter, or vnwholſome; the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation good, where the building is ruinous: the firſt moſt regular, where Succeſſion is not.

So that Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> though Biſhop of Rome, and a Pope, and many other ſucceeding him in that See, cannot be included with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the pale of Antichriſt, although it be pleaded that the Pope is Antichriſt, and reſolued ſo.</p>

                  <hi>Philip. 2. 30. Becauſe for the worke of Chriſt he was nigh vnto death, not regarding his owne life to ſupply your lacke. Epaphroditus</hi> is the man there ſpoken of: a faithfull ſeruant of Chriſt in the worke of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: who with the hazard of his owne life puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13149:75"/>
to doe ſeruice vnto the Church of God. This is the commendation Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giueth of him. Your inference is: Hee did more than hee needed to haue done: for who required any ſuch ſeruice at his hand as this? Hee might haue kept himſelfe cloſe, and warme at home: and haue ſlept if hee would, in an whole skinne. This is your good wholeſome Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Doctrine: For the benefit accruing out of the actions and Paſſions of Saints, is to make vp the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Church, out of workes ſupererogated by them, when they doe more than God requireth. As for inſtance, when the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> without not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actuall ſinnes, mortall, veniall, in your opinion, but alſo originall, as not conceiued in them, ſuffered yet much, which was not due to her: becauſe all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings are the wages of Sinne: as when martyrs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more, or greater torments, than can in iuſtice be exacted of them, though God ſhould enter into iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them, and deale with them in the rigour of his iuſtice.

               <p>Secondly, admit it, good Catholique truth; yet is it not to purpoſe true: for <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was then <hi>aliue;</hi> and vpon recouery, aliues-like. They are, and muſt be <hi>dead,</hi> that bring in their ſhot, to make vp that

maſſe of treaſure for the Church; and good cauſe why: For though then at preſent hee had enough at home, and alſo ſpare to ſerue others turnes, yet wiſdome would hee ſhould not be too lauiſh or profuſe; for happely hee might haue neede thereof himſelfe: For your Doctrine alſo is, <hi>Hee that ſtandeth may fall.</hi> No man is ſure of his Saluation: therefore, well is it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, though you regard it not, or know it not, that your ſtore is not to be augmented till men are dead. Thirdly, in your owne conſtruction and learning, this Text of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> will doe you no good: For in poynt of ſupply, for Pardons and Indulgences from the Actions and Paſſions of Saints, you admit not of merits, but onely ſatisfactions Now this text ſerueth, if at all, for any thing to any purpoſe, for merit, and not for ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, you play the Catholique knaue in plaine termes: a man may call a ſpade a ſpade, and him a knaue that ſo deſerueth it. For you will conuict vs by our owne Bibles. Now in our Bibles wee reade thus, <hi>Becauſe for the worke of Chriſt hee was nigh vnto death, not regarding his life, to ſupply your lacke of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice towards mee.</hi> You cut off theſe words <hi>of ſeruice towards mee;</hi> and ſet vp your reſt vpon, <hi>to ſupply your lacke:</hi> as if the defects of the <hi>Philippians</hi> toward God, had beene ſupplied by the ſtore of <hi>Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:</hi> whereas the defect was temporary, towards <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Paul,</hi> to ſupply which, <hi>Epaphroditus did venture his life.</hi> Such legerdemaine befitteth well your cauſe, not to be vpholden but by colluſion. Now goe and inferre your concluſion thus; <hi>Therefore the paſsions of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13149:76"/>
the ſeruants of God, may be imparted; and ſerue to good purpoſe to the Church:</hi> which no man but like you, will deny: but is not the thing in queſtion, or to be proued.

The truth is, as faitors vſe, you play faſt and looſe: For although a man in ſome one poynt may doe more than is exacted, in many other things hee doth much leſſe than he ſhould doe. A man profeſſeth continency and ſingle life, hee muſt preciſely keepe it. He chaſtiſeth and bringeth vnder his body, with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, praying, lying on the ground, &amp;c. the better to keepe it: as thoſe ancient <hi>Aſcetae</hi> and <hi>Anachorites</hi> did, in their meruailous and admirable <hi>Scleragogie;</hi> This was more than they needed to haue done, out of ſtrict commaund: But were they not defectiue?

If a man could in all things keepe the whole Law, and haue no neede at all to ſay, <hi>Forgiue mee my treſpaſſes,</hi> then hee might happely Supererogate: as in opinion of the Aduerſary, the bleſſed Virgin may: till then, that wee meete with ſuch perfect liuers, wee may conclude rather for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tererogation, than ſupererogation any way. So this is your Doctrine of <hi>Supererogation</hi> vnto the Law: that of Counſells Euangelicall, is but of pretence to extenuate and palliate the enormitie of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>That it is impoſsible to keepe the Commandements of God, though aſsiſted with his Grace, and the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Commandements of God are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, euen as himſelfe is perfect: and therefore the rule of our life and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>in ordine ad Deum,</hi> for the attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of eternall happineſſe in Heauen: all of them tendered vnto vs vnder that condition, and high commaunding forme, <hi>Do this and liue for euer,</hi> the ſtile, in ordinary, vnto the Law of the higheſt: a condition ſo requiſite in euery part, that the Delinquent but in one, is guilty of all, and lyable vnto puniſhment for breach of all.</p>
               <p>Humane Lawes are commonly but vpon miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors precedent, to be corrected and preuented: For, <hi>ex malis moribus bonae Leges: good Lawes come from euill lines:</hi> as Phiſicke is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13149:83"/>
to repaire empayrings in the outward man. But Gods Law, as all his waies are ſaide to be, was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faſhion; elder than tranſgreſſion; was <hi>Doe this and liue:</hi> as Phyſicke is alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, to preuent the diſeaſe before it breake out: to keepe off tranſgreſſion not yet in being, God gaue the Law.</p>
               <p>When it was firſt ſaid to man, <hi>Doe this and liue,</hi> there was no queſtion of poſſibility to doe it. <hi>God at the firſt made man right,</hi> ſaith the ſonne of <hi>Syrach, and left him in the hands of his owne counſell.</hi> Hee might not haue eaten, God did not compell or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate him ot it: which if hee had done, hee had liued for euer. Such was his caſe, his ſtate, and his abilitie in his originall being. The Law was then <hi>verbum ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breuiatum; Thou ſhalt not eate.</hi> One word, not tenne words, as anon afterwards. The <hi>annexum</hi> then the ſame which afterwards: <hi>If thou eate, thou ſhalt dye the death.</hi> The commaundement enlarged vnto more particulars, as Sinne increaſed: but the condition ſtill the ſame, <hi>liue,</hi> or <hi>dic:</hi> ſo that the Law was elder than tranſgreſſion, and had reſpect, not to weakeneſſe as it is now, but to power and poſſibilitie; which man then had, when as firſt the commandement <hi>Doe this,</hi> went forth to be obſerued.</p>
               <p>Then it was poſſible to keepe the Law. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that which man might haue done. The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is of poſſibility ſince, whether or no it be now poſſible which was then. Touching which poſſibility, and impoſſibility, I anſwere out of your owne ſchoole learning with <hi>Durand. Lib. 1. diſt. 42. qu.</hi> 2. There is a
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13149:84"/>
two-fold <hi>poſsibilitiy</hi> and <hi>impoſsibilitie.</hi> Firſt, a thing is <hi>poſsible</hi> in reſpect of actiue or paſſiue power and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pabilitie incident naturally. As thus. It is poſſible that the fire ſhould heate and warme mee actiuely: and I be warmed of the fire paſſiuely: becauſe there is that naturall actiue power in the fire to doe it: and that naturall paſſiue capability in mee to receiue it. So that is ſaide to be impoſſible, as many wayes, where there is no ſuch power nor capability in the creature, as, <hi>viz.</hi> for a man to flye, or a worme to walke.</p>
               <p>Secondly, a thing is poſſible, when there is a certaine habitude, reference, proportion, and correſpondency betwixt the termes: as betwixt a man and a liuing creature: the one hath an habitude vnto the other. Impoſſible is, where no ſuch habitude is: as <hi>euen</hi> and <hi>odde; two</hi> and <hi>three:</hi> It is not poſſible, that what is <hi>euen</hi> ſhould be <hi>odde:</hi> or what is <hi>odde</hi> ſhould be <hi>euen:</hi> that <hi>two</hi> ſhould be <hi>three:</hi> or <hi>three</hi> become <hi>two.</hi> Here is implyed a contradiction: as in this, Truth to be falſe: God deny himſelfe. Thus contradictorily, it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, not impoſſible to keepe Gods commandement: For there is no contradiction implied here. There is an habitude betwixt the termes. For there was in man created, as he came forth of the hands of his Maker, an actiue power to obſerue them: and in them, when they were tendred, a paſſiue poſſibility to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; which one day ſhall come againe into act, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that ſtate of perfection in Heauen. But at preſent, as the ſtate now ſtandeth, this capability is not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered: this poſſibility is not brought into act, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of fore-ſtaling hindrances and impeachments.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:13149:84"/>
And ſo our anſwere is vnto that queſtion, <hi>Whether it be poſsible for a man to keepe the Law and Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God,</hi> Negatiue: It is not poſſible for a man in ordinary courſe of Nature, <hi>ſtantibus vt nunc,</hi> to attaine to that perfection in this life, to keepe the Commandements preciſely.</p>
               <p>I ſay in ordinary courſe it is not poſſible, becauſe of impeachments. But ſimply it is not impoſſible for God, becauſe there is an habitude betwixt the termes, to aduance man in nature, by a ſpeciall and peculiar aſſiſtance of Grace, to that height of perfection, to keepe all the Commandements of God. It is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible: for the power: yet for act, ſet Chriſt Ieſus aſide, it was neuer done ſince the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi> Nor ſtanding the ordinary courſe of Nature, and diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Grace, ſhall euer be done in this world. For to keepe the Commandements, is to be without ſin, to keepe them all, and ſingular, in all poynts, at all times: not in ſome things onely at all times. Nor in all things at ſometimes onely.</p>
               <p>Thus then, that is poſſible which man can doe: that falleth within the <hi>verge</hi> of his Power to doe. Either meerely of himſelfe, or elſe by aſſiſtance of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current. It is confeſſed, I ſuppoſe, that no man of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, in himſelfe conſidered, can poſſibly now keepe all Gods Commandemenrs. For there being two origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Actions in Agents, <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Will;</hi> a man may haue <hi>power</hi> to doe, but no will. As <hi>Diues</hi> had to releeue <hi>Lazarus.</hi> A man may haue <hi>will,</hi> and no <hi>power;</hi> as <hi>Agar</hi> had to relieue her ſonne <hi>Iſmael</hi> almoſt affamiſhed. To an Act conſummate, both <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:13149:85"/>
                  <hi>Et Non caret effectu quod voluere duo:</hi> Either mans <hi>will</hi> is wanting to doe what he can; or his <hi>power</hi> not ſufficient to doe what hee would. Now for Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, where man faileth of himſelfe, he muſt haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto ſome abetting hability. As the man in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that cannot helpe himſelfe, muſt be relieued by ſome other. God muſt here doe it, or none elſe: for, of him is all our ſufficiency and might. God can by his Power, which is illimited, aduance any thing ſo farre vnto perfection, as hee will not doe it, in regard of his owne <hi>purpoſe</hi> and <hi>decree:</hi> in regard of <hi>order,</hi> and <hi>courſe</hi> in <hi>Nature.</hi> He can make Nature now altogether pure, as he did at firſt by ſupernaturall endowments; and as hee will doe at laſt in confirmed ſtate of Glory: But things ſtanding as they doe, and muſt, he will not doe it; and ſo it is impoſſible for man to attaine it, but onely by ſome diſpenſation, and peculiar eleuation: but in ſuch caſes of ſingularity, it muſt <hi>Conſtare</hi> what <hi>God</hi> wil doe. If it be a <hi>word</hi> gone out of his mouth, it is not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: if he haue ſaid it, it is impoſſible. Take here heed then leaſt we iuſtle his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>power</hi> together; which doing, we ſhall faſten many incongruities, abſurdities, and inconueniences vpon his Courſes, and Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the World.</p>
               <p>Againe, Man as he is patient, in reſpect of God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, though Agent in himſelfe, and his performing, muſt be conſidered three wayes; in a threefold ſtate, for a threefold time, as hath already beene touched: Of Nature, Grace, and Glory. And that of Nature, two wayes: Made by God, with all ſufficiency; depraued by the Diuell, to all diſſability: As once it was, as now
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13149:85"/>
it is. The Queſtion is not meant of <hi>Naturall ſtate,</hi> at all; what then man could doe: Any thing then, what now he can doe: Nothing at all now. Nor is it intended of the <hi>State of Glory,</hi> what hee ſhall be able then to doe. It is a ſtate of perfection confeſſed vpon all hands; of Perfection, without any Imperfections: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore performable euery way of all Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in all points, and at all times: but the queſtion is, of ordinary Grace in Regeneration, how farre it doth or may enable him now in this World.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that to <hi>keepe Gods Commandements,</hi> is to obſerue and doe what <hi>God</hi> commandeth to be done. Not onely in part, as to keepe preciſely and to an haire, ſome of the Statutes; or ſome branches, or clauſes of thoſe Statutes: or at ſometimes onely, but for euer; in all parts: of any one, and euery Commandement, all points muſt be kept and obſerued.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee conſider what they command, and how: which is comprehended in two heads. <hi>Spirituall Obedience,</hi> from and with the <hi>Heart: Perfect Obedience,</hi> with <hi>all the Heart.</hi> For, as <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſo thoſe that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth: not onely externally, with cap and knee. God is perfect, and accordingly the rule is; <hi>Be you perfect, as I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> Such as he is, ſuch be his Lawes; and ſuch obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto his Lawes is required of him that ſerueth God: But ſtill <hi>ſeruatis ſubiecti proprietatibus,</hi> as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect is capable of perfection. For nothing can be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,</hi> as God is perfect: that is, in the ſelfe-ſame degree of Perfection; for ſo it ſhould be God; but <hi>reſpectiuely</hi> perfect, in conformation like vnto him, as humane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13149:86"/>
can be enabled, not in iuſt proportion.</p>
               <p>God requireth not perfection as himſelfe hath it, nor yet perfection exceeding the proportion of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. Not the ſame here, which is required in Heauen; nor here of all men alike: but as he <hi>ſcattereth,</hi> ſo he <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth;</hi> as hee hath conferred two Talents, or fiue, ſo he exacteth. So that, at laſt to adde limits to this ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Propoſition, I reſolue it thus: No man in the ſtate of Grace regenerate, by any ordinary courſe or aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Grace, euer did or can obſerue all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, in euery part; no, not in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree which God hath fitted him vnto, and requireth of him, at all times: At ſome time he may, in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; or peraduenture in all particulars in ſome time, or ſome particulars in all time. Now let vs ſee how the Texts contrary this: or how the Fathers are of another opinion.</p>

                  <hi>Philip. 4. 13. I can doe all things in Chriſt that ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Contrary to expreſs words of their owne Bible.</note> 
                  <hi>me.</hi> Therefore keepe the Commandements of God. Therefore any man may doe it: Therefore euery man may keepe them. As if whatſoeuer <hi>Saint Paul</hi> could doe, might haue beene performed by any ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chriſtian: As if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> were not a man alone, of tranſcendent endowments, beyond ordinary alloy; who ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>He was in ſufferings beyond them all:</hi> who faith of himſelfe, <hi>Hee was rapt vp into the third Heauen, and heard things that neuer man heard.</hi> Secondly, what <hi>All things</hi> could hee doe? He that ſaith, <hi>All,</hi> ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mpteth none; and ſo you take it at a large extent. Could he make Contradictions true? could hee Prophecy, or ſpeake with Tongues, where, and when
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:13149:86"/>
he would? Could hee walke on the Waters, or in the Ayre at pleaſure? And yet he ſaith; <hi>I can doe all things.</hi> All things extended, includeth theſe things. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <hi>Quo warranto</hi> doth it follow, that amongſt thoſe <hi>All things,</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> could doe, the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Gods Commandements ſhould be ranked? If it be reioyned, That muſt be included. I reply, it is the Queſtion: and ſo ought to be proued, not begged.</p>
               <p>Againe, I anſwere; <hi>Pauls</hi> performing, goeth no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then Chriſts enabling: <hi>I can doe all things.</hi> But how? <hi>In Chriſt inabling me.</hi> That is, ſo farre as Chriſt ſhould or did inable him: but how appeareth that this is one of thoſe things, in which, or whereto Chriſt would inable him? So againe, this is the queſtion, and muſt be proued, not begged; beſide, Chriſt might ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him now, and not anon: many times, but not euer; in ſome things inable him, not in all.</p>
               <p>And yet farther, that <hi>All,</hi> hath a limitation. All thoſe things he could doe, of the which he ſpake, <hi>viz. want,</hi> and <hi>abound;</hi> ſuffer and endure proſperity and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſity alike, through the Grace of Chriſt Ieſus which did aſſiſt him. So <hi>Chryſoſtome, Theodoret, Oecumenius, Lombard, Thomas, Lyra, Caietan:</hi> So the Text it ſelfe to any man that ſhall but view it, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe, then that in the whole courſe of his life, hee was able to keepe the entire Law of GOD, in euery point, which is the ſtate to be made good, and yet was Saint <hi>Paul</hi> able to doe and performe as much, as any other man could performe.</p>
               <p>1 <hi>Iohn 5. 3. This is the loue of God, that wee keepe his Commandements.</hi> It is ſo: and what of that? Herein
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13149:87"/>
we ſhew our loue to God, that we keepe his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements: That is, in effect, as we loue him, ſo we keepe his Commandements; and as we keepe his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, ſo we loue him. Perfect or imperfect: in all or in part it is not ſaid. Indeed, we loue in part, not as wee ſhould; we keepe his Commandements in part, not as we ſhould, or would in all.</p>
               <p>But <hi>his Commandements are not grieuous.</hi> What of that? Therefore poſſible to be kept in euery point, at all times, by any man? I deny that. For, I ſee no ſuch ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell to be inferred. <hi>Grieuous,</hi> is ſimply or reſpectiuely. In regard of thoſe many incumbrances of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, the Law of Chriſt Ieſus was not grieuous. Againe, a thing may be weighty, and yet not in reputation or eſteeme, vnto ſome men; who will runne with that weight eaſily, or vndergoe that burthen willingly. For to a willing minde, what is grieuous, though it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable, inexpugnable, impoſſible? The Heathen man could tell vs, that the <hi>Romane</hi> Legions went often with alacrity vpon that peece of Seruice, from whence they knew and were aſſured, they ſhould neuer come off with life. Weighty and inſupportable are two things. Weighty and grieuous, are two things. To thoſe that loue God, nothing is heauy for God: not for the thing it ſelfe, but becauſe of Loue; which maketh that ſeeme light, which indeed is heauy, and giueth men, if not actiuity beyond power, yet will beyond poſſibility of Power to doe.</p>
               <p>See more. But firſt heare a reaſon, that interlopeth betwixt theſe teſtimonies of holy Writ. A reaſon or two: for ſo it is. The firſt, <hi>A man is not bound to impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities:
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13149:87"/>
but a man is bound to keepe the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Briefly, if the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were impoſſible, they could binde no man: For it is not to bee conceiued, how one ſhould ſinne, in a thing which hee could not poſſibly auoid.</note> 
                  <hi>and is lyable to puniſhment for breach of them.</hi> I anſwere: It is true, no man is tyed to ſimple Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, where there is no habitude betwixt the termes. As to be immortall in this life; to flye, or walke in the Ayre, or on the Waters. Such impoſſibility is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Law of God, and mans performance. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when the Commandements were giuen, there was not onely a poſſibility, but ability and ſufficiency in man to keepe Gods Law: For in effect and ſubſtance it was all one, <hi>Eate and dye,</hi> with <hi>Doe this and liue.</hi> The particulars were explained in time, the Nature of Obligation altered not: If ſince there hath accrued an impoſſibility of Conſequence, what is this to that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency which was before, when the Law was firſt giuen; and man tyed to Obedience, as <hi>Adam</hi> was?</p>
               <p>Againe, it is confeſſed with Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> that <note place="margin">It is not to be conceiued how one ſhould ſin in a thing which hee could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly auoid.</note> ſinne is not ſinne, except it be voluntary He that cannot poſſibly auoid neceſſity of ſinning, is iniuriouſly dealt withall, if he be puniſhed for ſinning: But no man is ſo neceſſitated, either actiuely in regard of the ouer-awing and determining decree of God, vnauoidable, vnreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. No man is ſo neceſſitated paſſiuely. For, as hath beene ſaid, betwixt mans Actiue poſſibility, and the Paſſiue poſſibility of Gods Law, there was at firſt, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is, and finally ſhall be, a Correſpondency. If <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim, ſtantibus vt nunc,</hi> impediments, incumbrances make it impoſſible, man may thanke himſelfe that hath loſt his power of performing.</p>
               <p>Now ſee more, and ſee as little. <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 15. 15. a place twice or thrice alleaged by this Trifler againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:13149:88"/>
whom hee knoweth not to receiue the Booke as Canonicall: and therefore not bound to ſtand vnto the authority of the ſame, or ſubſcribe vnto the aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But I quarrell it not: I accept the authority, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere it out of the Text. <hi>They obſerue his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo farre,</hi> as to doe their beſt, and teſtifie their good will. Which proueth, in his opinion, rather a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, then any poſſibility of perfection. <hi>If thou wilt, thou ſhalt obſerue the Commandements, and testifie thy good will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ezech. 36. 27. I will put my ſpirit in the middeſt of you, and will make you to walke in my ſtatutes.</hi> It is the effect and operation of Gods Spirit to doe this. But the Prophet doth not ſay; They ſhall not ſtumble, nor fall, as many walkers doe, who yet attaine their iournies end in peace, and goe on in their courſe with commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. The Prophet addeth: <hi>And you ſhall keepe my Iudgements, and doe them.</hi> I will take no aduantage vpon the word <hi>Iudgements;</hi> Let it goe for the <hi>morall Law of God.</hi> He keepeth the Law, that doth what hee can: and hath defects and infirmities pardoned him. As <hi>Dauid</hi> is ſaid to haue done, who yet fell foule moe times then one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mathew</hi> 11. 30. ſpeaketh of a <hi>yoake,</hi> the ſame in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect with 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 3. That which is not heauy to bee borne, is not impoſſible to be kept: but Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements are not heauy: for they are the <hi>yoake,</hi> which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>is eaſie.</hi> I anſwere, Chriſt ſpeaketh not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily of Gods Commandements there, but of the Polity of Grace in the Goſpell of Peace, in regard of the Polity of the Law, to which hee preferreth it as
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:13149:88"/>
eaſier, and leſſe cumberſome, for cauſes well collected and obſerued by <hi>Maldonate</hi> out of the Fathers. You may ſee other expoſitions in <hi>Ianſenius:</hi> but nothing for your dreame of perfection.</p>
               <p>Againe, in this argumentation, <hi>that which is not heauie to be borne, is not impoſsible to be kept;</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is abſolutely falſe. For it is <hi>iugum,</hi> though <hi>dulce:</hi> as feathers are <hi>onus,</hi> though <hi>alleuians:</hi> as wheeles, though cauſe of motion, vnto a Coach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matthew</hi> 19. 17. Is not to purpoſe. The queſtion is not, whether <hi>To keepe Gods Commandements</hi> be the ready way and means to enter into life: that Scripture ſaith ſo, and Proteſtants approue it, for them that can doe it. But whether no man otherwiſe entreth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life: whether euery one that entreth into life, hath perſonally kept Gods Commandements: whether it be poſſible for them to doe it, This Proteſtants deny. This that Scripture ſaith not. Againe, it is not heere propoſed as a <hi>condition</hi> vnto him, but as a <hi>Conuicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> who came in the vanitie of his minde, truſting in his owne worth. And is propoſed as a neceſſary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Law vnto him, who was a Lawyer by Profeſſion, and propoſed his queſtion onely <hi>De faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endis,</hi> the Tenor of the Law: not <hi>de credendis,</hi> the <hi>Tenet</hi> of the Goſpell. And doubtleſſe if Saluation be ſought by onely doing, the workes of the Law muſt needes be done. But how doth this follow, if thoſe that ſeeke Saluation by their owne worke, muſt be put ouer to performe the workes of the Law, therefore all men muſt preciſely keepe the law? the fooliſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of ſome foole hardy vndertaker, is no preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:13149:89"/>
vnto wiſer men. Nor tye for them to venture on the ſame follies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn 14. 15. If you loue mee keepe my Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And adde if you will in the ſame Chapter, <hi>If any man loue mee hee will keepe my word.</hi> And Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 15. <hi>If you keepe my Commandements, you abide in my loue.</hi> All which, and others of that Nature, proue this, <hi>Gods Commandements</hi> muſt be kept: they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not the manner and meaſure of the thing, <hi>How, wherein, how farre</hi> they may be kept. Secondly, I anſwere out of <hi>Ianſenius,</hi> Chriſt doth not vnderſtand the whole Law of God; but ſome part of the Law of the New Teſtament: <hi>ea ſcilicet quae modo tradidi,</hi> of <hi>Faith in mee:</hi> and <hi>Loue amongst your ſelues.</hi> Nor doth our Sauiour here promiſe any ability to doe it: or ſpecifie any performance of it: but exhorteth them rather to ſhew their loue vnto him, by ſtriuing to doe what hee gaue them in charge, rather than to weepe and take-on for his departure. Thus <hi>Ianſenius</hi> one of your owne ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rom. 13. 8. He that hath charity hath fulfilled the Law.</hi> True, hee that hath it <hi>in gradu ſummo:</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Regenerate man hath <hi>charitie.</hi> True, at leaſt in remiſſe degrees. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the Perfection of Charity; and of perfect <hi>fulfilling</hi> of the Law; or elſe of Charity with imperfections: and ſo of anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fulfilling of the Law. Euery true regenerate man hath Charity. True: and ſo fulfilleth the Law in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it. But ſometime more, ſometime leſſe: and ſo accordingly fulfilleth the Law. Againe, the Apoſtle ſaith by way of ſuppoſition, <hi>He that hath charity:</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:13149:89"/>
hee doth not auouch that any man hath it, ſo as is ſufficient totally to fulfill the Law. So that at leaſt, the text cited is not to purpoſe. Beſide, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it by way of exhortation, <hi>Becauſe</hi> it is the <hi>fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> of the Law. And the nearer a man commeth vnto perfect loue, the nearer hee is to fulfill the Law. Now in Exhortations to performance, we vſe to ayme at the higheſt, and ſet vp the beſt, for markes and obiects. Which the Apoſtle did: not as perſwaded all men would attaine, or could attaine vnto it, but to incite them to indeauour vtterly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioſua 11. 15. 22. 5. Pſalm. 17. 3. Luke</hi> 1. 6. are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of men that are remembred to haue walked in Gods Commandements, and kept his Lawes. A thing done; therefore not impoſſible to be done. To which I anſwere, firſt, as this Rouer ſhooteth his bolt at them, there is no conſequence: Some men haue done it, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euery man, or any man, may doe it: For they happely might doe it by extraordinary aſſiſtance; and by miraculous grace: but the Propoſition is of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe. Secondly, it is no where ſaid that theſe holy men, all of them, at all times, did keepe all the Commandements of God. They did their beſt, and it was accepted by God.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Ioſhua</hi> is to be taken and vnderſtood, onely of one particular kinde; Namely the execution of Gods <hi>iuſtice</hi> vpon the Cananites, and the Inhabitants of the Land of Canaan: And yet hee failed euen in that, and kept not all, as is cleare in the caſe of the Gibeonites. The man as well might haue brought out <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aron,</hi> whoſe commendation is, <hi>That, as the Lord
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:13149:90"/>
commanded, ſo did they.</hi> And yet we know there were ſome things, in which they failed both: for which cauſe they entred not into the Land of Canaan ouer <hi>Iordan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſalm. 17. 3. That there was no ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in him.</hi> Which if you take at full extent, you muſt anſwere your Proſelites vnto this Queſtion, <hi>What was the Caſe of Vriah and his Wife,</hi> if hee kept all the Commandements of God: and no iniquitie was found in him? Sure we muſt take it of the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fall. And ſuppoſe the <hi>Pſalme</hi> to haue beene made before that. For in that action hee cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. He notoriouſly broke the Law in two enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſinnes, of Murther &amp; Adultery at one time: <hi>Then, there was iniquitie in his hands;</hi> at leaſt.</p>
               <p>That of <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> is of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. For it is ſaid, <hi>They walked in all the Commandements of God without blame.</hi> But firſt one ſingular example is not concluding for all, or for a common courſe. It neuer was denied, but God might, extraordinarily, aduance ſome one or other vnto ſuch an height of Perfection, as fully and perfectly to keepe all his commandements poynt <hi>per</hi> poynt. God might haue done it: but hee neuer did it. Neuer man attained ſuch a pitch. Secondly, it is not ſaid, that <hi>They kept the commandements of God,</hi> which was this mans vndertaking. But they <hi>walked in them:</hi> in which courſe they might haue rubbes, diuerſions, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backes, ſlidings, fals. Then, <hi>they walked in them,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxable, vnblameable, not complained of. Not that God could finde no fault with them, but that men
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:13149:90"/>
could not blame them; nor ſay, <hi>blacke is their eye.</hi> Gods eyes are tenne thouſand times brighter than the Sunne, and can diſcry blemiſhes where men cannot. The keeping his Commaundements muſt not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the view and cenſure of men, but after the eſtimate of God. But they were <hi>iuſt before him</hi> too. So they might be, and yet not keepe all his Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. For <hi>euen the iuſt man falleth ſeauen times a day.</hi> Perfection is three-fold, in different degrees: <hi>Actuall euer,</hi> and in being: incident onely to the Saints in glory. <hi>Actuall</hi> not in-being, but deſire: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring all euermore vnto God, by conſecrating all vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Glory. And <hi>Habituall,</hi> when in purpoſe a man loueth God aboue all, and is ready to leaue all other things for Gods ſake. This man is vnblameable euen before God: not becauſe hee cannot be reprehended: but becauſe hee is not reprehended; God in mercy accepting his will and deſire, for his deed. Thus <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> himſelfe hath anſwered the place, being to oppoſe the <hi>Pelagians.</hi> Many moe places might be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, to as little purpoſe, which either proue that which is not denied: or proue it in part, and ſo are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue. Now Fathers wee may ſee, to as little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſome few heere remembred. His good Maſter <hi>C. W. B.</hi> could haue afforded him moe. The firſt is, <hi>Origen hom. 9. in Ioſua.</hi> But what hee ſaith, the good ſimple man knoweth not, becauſe his inſtructor did not let him vnderſtand, as being not fully informed from <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> himſelfe. But thus it ſtandeth. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> figuratiuely, as his manner is, maketh theſe ſorts of men in the Church: <hi>Viros, mulieres, infantes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytos.</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:13149:91"/>
Thoſe whom hee compareth vnto <hi>Women,</hi> he exhorteth, to ſtriue what they may, to attaine to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of <hi>Men</hi> in chriſtianitie. Now hee calleth them <hi>Mulieres,</hi> comparing them to Women, who ſay, <hi>I cannot doe as it is written; Goe ſell all, and giue it to the poore: nor yet turne to him my other cheeke that ſtriketh mee vpon one: nor bleſſe him that curſeth mee. Caetera ſimilia quae mandantur, qui dicit implere non poſſum, quid tibi videtur aliud, quàm inter mulieres, quae nihil virile poſſunt, eſſe numerandus? Hee that faith, I cannot doe theſe, and ſuch other things as theſe, which be commaunded, ſeemeth hee not worthily to be accounted amongſt women? Origen</hi> heere ſpeaketh of Perfection, and degrees of Proficiency. Who queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth it? and inſinuateth that a man might keepe thoſe Precepts of the Goſpell. Who Doubteth of it? but doth <hi>Origen</hi> ſay it is poſſible, for a man to keepe all the Commandements of God? Shew me that, and I haue done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyril Lib. 4. contra Iulian:</hi> So your director told you; perhaps through error of the Printer. And you good Innocent, belieued him. But go conſult with <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,</hi> and you ſhall finde it in his <hi>third</hi> Booke, about the middle, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> directed your Director. <hi>In the Law it was written,</hi> as ſaith <hi>Cyril</hi> there, <hi>Thou ſhalt not couet.</hi> It is poſſible, to keepe this Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> through aſſiſtance of Grace, and ſo, not to <hi>couet</hi> at all. Which thing, if St. <hi>Cyryl</hi> ſaid, hee ſaid not onely more than hee can make good, but more alſo than is required. More than <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would haue him ſay, or doth deſire at his hands. Nay
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:13149:91"/>
more than he would approue in him, or make good, if he ſhould ſay it. For <hi>Non concupiſcec, thou ſhalt not couet,</hi> goeth on ſo farre, as to exclude, euen veniall sins. Which needeth not. For our Maſters yeelde vnto them, and exclude no more but mortall ſinnes. It is poſſible to fulfill the Law. Why? Becauſe the Law forbiddeth and condemneth onely <hi>mortall ſinnes.</hi> But a man cannot poſſibly auoide <hi>veniall ſinnes.</hi> Thoſe therefore the Law forbiddeth not. They may be <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> beſide the intent of the Law: They are not <hi>contra</hi> againſt the Law.

If Saint <hi>Cyril</hi> ſaide, that <hi>Non concupiſces,</hi> may be performed: that is, that the ſuſtentation of Sinne may ceaſe, he ſaid that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will not defend.

                  <hi>Impoſsibilia eſſe ſpiritus ſancti praecepta.</hi> Our Engliſh Iugler repreſenteth it. <hi>That the Commandements of God are impoſsible.</hi> Of <hi>God.</hi> For <hi>of the Spirit. Why?</hi> what materiall difference? <hi>The Spirit is God:</hi> and God is a Spirit. Yet a difference betwixt the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and, Commandements of the Spirit. For marke. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> explaining thoſe words, <hi>Attende tibi,</hi> ſaith, they may be conceiued of two wayes. Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13149:93"/>
looke to thy Body, and the things thereof. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually; and that which appertaineth vnto the ſtate of thy Soule. And he addeth, they muſt be taken for the things of the ſoule: becauſe, <hi>that which God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,</hi> as you will haue it, or as he ſpeaketh, <hi>The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of the Spirit,</hi> are not impoſſible. But to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a mans body corporally, is impoſſible: For it cannot be, that euery part of a mans body ſhould be ſo perpetually in his Eye, as that attendance be ſtill vpon it. The Eye cannot diſcerne it ſelfe, nor yet any part of the <hi>head,</hi> the <hi>backe,</hi> or <hi>inward</hi> parts. This is impoſſible: therefore this is not the meaning. <hi>For the Spirit would not command things impoſsible:</hi> that is, impoſſible in themſelues, where there is an impoſſibility betwixt the termes. So that in Saint <hi>Baſil, impoſsibility,</hi> is that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility which is not <hi>actionis ſuſceptiua.</hi> For as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſis</hi> obſerueth; the <hi>Irrefragable Doctor.</hi> Poſſibility is of two kinds. <hi>Actiua,</hi> and <hi>Actionis ſuſceptiua. Par. 3. memb. 5. art.</hi> 1. Now no man ſaith it is impoſſible to keepe <hi>any,</hi> or <hi>all</hi> Gods Commandements; becauſe <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>of themſelues,</hi> they are not keepeable. The Eye is not <hi>ſuſceptiua actionis,</hi> to behold or ſee the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. But that which the <hi>Spirit</hi> there commandeth, is in it ſelfe poſſible to be done. So <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith as little to the purpoſe, as any other Writer doth whatſoeuer; being arightly vnderſtood, and not peruerted in his meaning. See <hi>Baſil,</hi> and if this be not his meaning, let me be held as honeſt as this Gagger, that peruerteth his ſence a contrary way, that is, a falſe knaue.</p>

Poſſible now in <hi>part,</hi> though not in <hi>all:</hi> to <hi>ſome</hi> men, albeit not generally vnto all. It plainly appeareth what <hi>Hierome</hi> meant: for he addeth, <hi>Sed quia homines poſsibilia non faciunt, idcircò omnis mundus ſubditus eſt Deo, &amp; indiget miſericordiâ eius. But becauſe men doe not that which of it ſelfe is poſsible, therefore all the World is ſubiected vnto God, and ſtandeth in neede of his mercy.</hi> So that hee explaineth his owne meaning: They were poſſible in themſelues, though not poſſible vnto man. Secondly, ſome things poſſible at ſome time, to ſome men, though not to all men at all times. And ſo is that to be vnderſtood which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath out of the ſame <hi>Hierome</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. omitted by this Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; becauſe not found in his good Founder <hi>C.

But for thoſe three
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13149:95"/>
ſeuerall acts, in the iuſtification of a Sinner, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture plainely (it cannot be denied) doth diſtinguiſh them thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rom. 4. 5. He that belieueth in him that iuſtifieth the vngodly. Auguſtine</hi> vpon the 30. <hi>Pſalme</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it thus. <hi>Who is it that iuſtifieth the Wicked? Hee that of a wicked man maketh a righteous.</hi> So, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 20. 24. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. For there is a two-fold ſtate of man in this world: The one <hi>Originall;</hi> as he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and borne in ſinne, and accordingly produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in life and actions, the curſed workes of a bitter roote: The other <hi>Acquiſite,</hi> renewed according to the Spirit, vnto the ſtate of perfection with God. Of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>wherein:</hi> Of Grace, <hi>whereto.</hi> In Nature, there is nothing cleane, or pure, that can pleaſe God, or be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him: Hee is not iuſt that is in this ſtate. In that of Grace, a man is <hi>iuſt</hi> when hee is <hi>changed:</hi> which muſt haue concurrence of two things. Priuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>being</hi> to that which was; <hi>the Body of ſinne.</hi> A new <hi>conſtitution</hi> vnto God, in another ſtate. In which, hee that is altered in ſtate: changed in condition: transformed in minde: renewed in ſoule: regenerate and borne a new to God by Grace, is <hi>iuſt:</hi> in the ſtate of iuſtification: ceaſing to be what hee was: becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming what he was not before.</p>
               <p>Thus to be changed, is to be a new Creature. The act is ſaide by <hi>Dauid, Pſalm. 51. To create:</hi> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a worke of Omnipotent power, exceedeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment of any Creature. It is not therefore <hi>of</hi> our ſelues, <hi>from,</hi> or <hi>by</hi> our ſelues. But this change is, <hi>the worke of the right hand of the moſt high,</hi> operating
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13149:96"/>
powerfully, as hee <hi>can:</hi> and actiuely, as hee <hi>will.</hi> Wrought it is by God: by God alone: Man, or Mans free-will is not author hereof. Therefore no <hi>merit</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terveneth: therefore not to be aſcribed to our ſelues. None here but Chriſt preuenting vs: the <hi>Author</hi> of our <hi>integritie: crowne</hi> of our <hi>felicitie:</hi> and <hi>conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mator</hi> of our <hi>glorie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, to <hi>iuſtifie,</hi> is to giue increaſe, and augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation vnto that firſt Article, as to be more iuſt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe and <hi>profectu:</hi> by increaſe of Grace, and the fruit of that Spirit, by which they are renewed in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner man. In naturall <hi>action</hi> and <hi>paſsion</hi> it plainely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth. Cold water is made warme vpon the fire: heere is an alteration of the propertie. Warme water is made hotter by continuing on the fire, with an augmentation and acceſſe of that heate. So I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, <hi>Apoc. 22. Qui iuſtus eſt, iuſtificetur adhuc. Hee that is iuſt, let him become more iuſt,</hi> by acceſſe of Gods Grace euer, day by day.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to <hi>iuſtifie</hi> is to <hi>declare</hi> and <hi>pronounce one iuſt.</hi> as, <hi>Prou. 8. He that iuſtifieth the wicked, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the righteous, is alike abominable before the Lord.</hi> So againe in the 50. <hi>Pſalme, That thou mayeſt be iuſtified in thy ſayings, and cleare when thou art iudged.</hi> God is not otherwiſe iuſtified, but by being <hi>knowne, acknowledged,</hi> and confeſſed <hi>iuſt</hi> in all his wayes. As he is ſaid to be <hi>magnified,</hi> when his noble acts are made knowne, and men doe praiſe him for his mercy, goodneſſe, and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Iuſtification properly is in the firſt acceptance. A Sinner is then <hi>iuſtified</hi> when hee is <hi>made iuſt:</hi> that is,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13149:96"/>
tranſlated from ſtate of Nature, to ſtate of Grace, as <hi>Coloſ. 1. 13. Who hath deliuered vs from the power of darkeneſſe, and hath tranſlated vs into the Kingdome of his deere Sonne.</hi> Which is <hi>motion,</hi> as they ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two termes, and conſiſteth in forgiueneſſe of ſinnes primarily; and Grace infuſed ſecondarily: Both the act of Gods Spirit in man, but <hi>applyed,</hi> or rather <hi>obtained</hi> through <hi>Faith:</hi> which <hi>repreſenteth</hi> firſt God willing, and ready to forgiue and renew. <hi>Draweth</hi> neere vnto him: <hi>cloſeth</hi> in faſt with him. <hi>Adhereth</hi> vnto him inſeparab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that properly to ſpeake, <hi>God onely iuſtifieth,</hi> who alone <hi>imputeth</hi> not, but <hi>pardoneth ſinne:</hi> Who onely can and doth <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate vs from death vnto life, renueth a right Spirit:</hi> and <hi>createth a new heart within vs.</hi> Cauſally, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuely God doth it.

But theſe are all <hi>with,</hi> and <hi>from Faith:</hi> which in the very act of iuſtification, are not <hi>actiue,</hi> though ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually there, <hi>then, before,</hi> and <hi>after:</hi> at leaſt, ſome of them, perhaps not all. Iuſtification is not but in the Church: Faith is the life and originall of the Church: as appeareth by the Scriptures, by the Subiect, and performance of Faith. So that worthily may the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall indowment of Grace, be aſcribed vnto the roote and originall of Chriſtian Piety, Faith. <hi>Fides prima datur,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine: ex qua caetera impetran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> In the firſt ſignification then of iuſtification, the which properly is iuſtification, wee acknowledge <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentally Faith alone,</hi> and <hi>Cauſally God alone.</hi> In the ſecond and third, beſide God and Faith, wee yeeld to Hope, and Holineſſe, and Sanctification, and the fruits of the Spirit in good workes. But both theſe are not Iuſtification: rather Fruits, and Conſequents, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, &amp; appendants of Iuſtification; then Iuſtification, which is a ſolitary act.</p>
               <p>So that well, and truly, and according to the tenet of Antiquity, is it reſolued by our Church, <hi>Artic. 11. We are accounted righteous before God, onely for the merit of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, by faith, and not for our owne workes or deſeruing.</hi> Our <hi>Iustification,</hi> in the <hi>act</hi> thereof, is onely the <hi>worke of God,</hi> for Chriſts ſake: whoſe death and Paſſion apprehended by Faith, which is the ſole peculiar worke of Faith to doe, as it hath made an attonement betwixt God and vs, ſo hath it procured remiſſion of our Sinnes at his hands, and thereupon a new ſtate of Grace: not for any
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13149:97"/>
merit, or deſeruing of our own, which is vtterly exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this Act. Thus <hi>Thomas 1. 2. q. 114. ar. 7. Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo modo aliquis poteſt ſibi mereri reparationem poſt lapſum. Reſtauration after fall,</hi> that is Iuſtification of a ſinner, <hi>no man can procure, or deſerue vnto himſelfe.</hi> To whom agreeth the Councell of <hi>Trent Seſſ. vi. can. viij.</hi> and your owne men confeſſe it is <hi>gratuita.</hi> And therefore, as our <hi>Article</hi> saith, <hi>not for our owne workes or deſeruings.</hi> Further our Church proceedeth not, to the <hi>augmentation,</hi> or <hi>declaration,</hi> of <hi>iuſtification</hi> there. But inferreth: <hi>Wherefore, that we are iuſtified by faith alone, is a moſt wholeſome Doctrine, and very full of comfort:</hi> as it is indeede: and your long diſputes may intangle the ſimple, but not infringe the truth, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede diſcent from it. <hi>Fides non abſoluit iuſtificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Caſalius,</hi> and wee admit it) but <hi>ſola iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat;</hi> and hee admitteth that: For ſo haue antiquitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouched generally, as himſelfe and <hi>Caſſander</hi> doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, <hi>Origen, Hilary,</hi> and many others, to haue reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo.</p>
               <p>But this is <hi>contrary vnto our Bible, 1 Corinth. 13. 2. Though I haue all faith, ſo that I could remoue moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and haue no charitie, I am nothing. Therefore only faith doth not iuſtifie.</hi> Why? becauſe Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Charity doth not iuſtifie: for the greateſt Faith that can be, without it, is nothing. As if it were not in euery Proteſtants mouth: and confeſſed by theſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, that howbeit <hi>Faith alone doth iuſtifie,</hi> yet, <hi>not that Faith which is alone</hi> doth iuſtifie: <hi>Fides ſola,</hi> but not <hi>ſolitaria. Faith</hi> that is without <hi>Charitie</hi> doth not <hi>iuſtifie:</hi> but <hi>Faith</hi> may yet <hi>iuſtifie</hi> without <hi>Charitie.</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:13149:98"/>
They haue their ſeuerall diſtinct <hi>acts;</hi> and the <hi>act of Faith</hi> is to <hi>iuſtifie:</hi> though both are vertues incident to a iuſt man. As if the Proteſtants that affirme onely <hi>Faith doth iuſtifie,</hi> did withall maintaine that all Faith did iuſtifie: or as, if hee that propoſeth a thing <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,</hi> muſt needes imply the condition to be reall and true. It is a ſuppoſition, <hi>if I had all Faith, &amp;c.</hi> but a ſuppoſition of impoſſibility: For it is impoſſible that <hi>all Faith,</hi> ſhould be without <hi>Charitie;</hi> though ſome may be, and is without it. Beſide, I can anſwere, that the Faith which iuſtified, when it did iuſtifie, (to admit the Supposition of poſſibilitie) was not then without Charitie, though afterwards it was. For, in your opinion, iuſtifying Faith may diminiſh, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and be loſt. Now iuſtification being in an inſtant; may eftſoones be loſt againe: Why not? and ſo a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of Faith, and Loue. Secondly, it is contrary to <hi>Iam. 2. 24. You ſee then how that by workes a man is iuſtified,</hi> and not <hi>by Faith only.</hi> In this poynt of Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as <hi>mine</hi> and <hi>thine,</hi> are the common barretters of the World, ſo <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>good Workes</hi> haue broken the peace. It is the errour of the Proteſtants, ſay the Papiſts, that <hi>Faith onely iuſtifieth.</hi> It is the errour of the Papiſts, ſay the Proteſtants, <hi>that Workes doe iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.</hi> Flat <hi>ad oppoſitum,</hi> at leaſt in tormes. And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould a man belieue? Nay more, this difference ſeemeth very ancient, and in being when thoſe names of oppoſition, Proteſtants and Papiſts, were not heard of in the world. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: <hi>By Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the workes of the Law.</hi> And Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith, as poſitiuely, <hi>by Workes, and not alone by Faith.</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13149:98"/>
againſt Scripture; Apoſtle againſt Apoſtle; <hi>Paul</hi> againſt <hi>Iames; Iames</hi> againſt <hi>Paul.</hi> Is Chriſt diuided? or the Spirit irreſolued? or at oddes? God forbid. At oddes they were then, as wee are now. I would that wee were at no more oddes now, than they then were: Controuerſies ſoone might be at an end, and Chriſts Coate diuided, ſoone made vp againe, which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantled with new rentts daily.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had great contentions, all dayes of his life, in the whole courſe of his miniſtery; with halfe-Chriſtians, falſe-Chriſtians, thoſe of <hi>Conciſion,</hi> as hee termeth them. That neged <hi>as neceſsary vnto Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, workes,</hi> and obſeruing of the Law. As if Chriſt without them did not profit any thing: againſt theſe hee aduaunceth the excellency and worth of Faith: and depreſſeth the condition of any or all thoſe works of the Law, whereupon they inſiſted; on which they relied: whereof they gloried Saint <hi>Iames</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, oppoſeth as much <hi>Simon Magus, Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> their adherents, and that damnable Sect of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> that liuing in all brothelry, and horrid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties; caſt off all care and opinion, and account of good workes: as being for imperfect ones, for ſimple ones, and beginners in Chriſtianity, not to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or inſued of, by themſelues, who would be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perfect men in their Generations; and through <hi>Faith alone,</hi> as they pretended, of neete acquaintance and alliance with God. Againſt theſe Saint <hi>Iames</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the neceſſitie of workes. But neither doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> deny <hi>workes,</hi> to the Regenerate: nor Saint <hi>Iames</hi> deny the <hi>act of Faith.</hi> Secondly, I anſwere here, that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13149:99"/>
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of Iuſtification in attaining it: which in reſpect of man, is confeſſed to be the act of Faith. Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> of Iuſtification now obtayned: which neceſſarily is not ſeperate from workes. <hi>Iuſtus factus,</hi> through the Grace of Chriſt: is <hi>Iuſtus decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus,</hi> by his holy life and conuerſation. And ſo Saint <hi>Iames</hi> is expounded by your ſelues: or elſe hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of Iuſtification: as it is alſo taught by your owne men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iames 2. 14. What doth it profit though a man ſaith hee hath faith, and hath no workes? Can faith ſaue him?</hi> Nothing at all. Not at all. For a better <hi>ſaith</hi> then that which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> meant, the Faith of the <hi>Gnoſtiques,</hi> the Deuils had. Beſide, it is a <hi>faith</hi> onely ſupposed, preſumed, and in opinion. <hi>If a man (ſay he) hath faith.</hi> A manifeſt inſinuation it was not <hi>reall.</hi> A Faith <hi>boaſted of,</hi> but not <hi>had.</hi> So that this <hi>Faith,</hi> and that other of the Proteſtants, <hi>Caelo &amp; ſolo diſparantur.</hi> Nor can they be compared as they are. For the <hi>Faith</hi> of the Proteſtants (generall or ſpeciall, I diſpute not now) is a <hi>Faith</hi> wrought and infuſed by God, through the Grace of Chriſt: <hi>Liuing: liuely: actiue: fruitfull:</hi> declaring the roote by the good fruit: they neuer ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate them in their Doctrine. And your men doe blame them, becauſe they neuer ſeperate, the Spring and water-courſe, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>good workes,</hi> but they profeſſe it muſt and doth worke by Loue. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a lying imputation, that <hi>good workes, are not neceſſary to Saluation.</hi> All Writers, old and new, as <hi>Caſſander</hi> ſaith in generall, doe with ioynt conſent teach, that Faith muſt bring forth the fruit of good
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13149:99"/>
workes. Otherwiſe, It is a dead faith without workes. And hee produceth the Confeſſion of the Proteſtants thus: <hi>Fatendum eſt, haec opera quae à iuſtificatis fiunt, ad ſalutem; id eſt regnum Dei &amp; vitam aeternam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequendam, eſſe neceſſaria, iuxta illud, ſi vis ad vitam ingredi, ſerua mandata: It muſt be confeſſed, that the workes which are done of iuſtified men, are neceſſary to obtaine Saluation: that is, to purchaſe the Kingdome of God, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Albeit that good workes, which are the fruits of faith, and follow after Iuſtification, cannot put away ſinnes, and indure the ſeueritie of Gods iudgement, yet are they pleaſing and acceptable to God in Chriſt, and doe neceſſarily ſpring out from a true and liuely Faith. Inſomuch, as that by them a true and liuely faith, may as euidently be knowne, as a Tree is diſcerned by the fruit.</hi> I adde, as this mans Spirit is diſcerned by his lying. That of <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22. is ſo farre from being expreſſe in the point, that it is farre from being to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. It is not for iuſtifying of a ſinner by workes, but rather for relapſing of one iuſtified by Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>See Fathers that affirme the ſame.</hi> Namely, that which wee doe teach: that Faith alone iuſtifieth: For ſo all theſe three named doe: <hi>Origen, Hilary,</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe. Origen,</hi> ſaith <hi>Caſſander,</hi> clearely declareth, in his Commentaries vpon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, Solâ fide, abſque operibus, aliquos fuiſſe iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatos: That ſome haue beene iuſtified by Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, without any workes at all.</hi> The Theefe vpon
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13149:100"/>
the Croſſe was not ſaued by workes, which hee had not. <hi>Faith</hi> alone ſaued him, in the mercies of Chriſt: but this being ſpeciall, and therefore extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, may admit an exception for common vſe. Therefore in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. he ſpeaketh plaine, in generall, not with that limitation of ſome. <hi>Iuſtification of Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſufficeth: albeit a man hath not done any workes.</hi> As direct a Proteſtant as euer wrote, <hi>Caluin,</hi> or <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius</hi> could ſay no more. But in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. he is otherwiſe minded. If ſo: what, why vrge you the witneſſe of him, that ſaith and vnſaith the ſame thing? But it is not ſo. <hi>Origen</hi> is wronged by you. His words are: <hi>Faith cannot be reputed vnto Iuſtice to ſuch, as beleeue Chriſt, and yet put not off the old man, with his Acts.</hi> Doe Proteſtants ſay it can be? We diſtinguiſh <hi>Hiſtoricall,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtifying Faith.</hi> You doe difference Faith in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, if in nothing elſe. <hi>Beliefe,</hi> may be <hi>before, without</hi> Iuſtification; a generall aſſent, without application, or adheſion. <hi>Origen</hi> is in this alſo, a perfect Proteſtant. It is their Doctrine, <hi>That there is a Faith which iuſtifieth not.</hi> It is <hi>Origens</hi> Doctrine abſolutely. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith; <hi>Which beleeueth Chriſt:</hi> He doth not ſay, <hi>Which belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in Chriſt.</hi> Thus <hi>per omnia,</hi> in all points he ſideth with the Proteſtants in their Faith, concerning Faith as you propoſe it. Secondly, ſee <hi>Hilary</hi> vpon <hi>Math.</hi> 7. And doe: See him Proteſtant, to thy confirmation. See him Papiſt to thy confuſion. <hi>The ſaluation of Nations,</hi> are his words, <hi>is through faith: and in the Precepts of the Lord, the life of all men.</hi> Doth this man ſpeake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Iuſtification of a man by Faith, that aſcribeth ſaluation vnto Faith? And <hi>Can.</hi> 8. in <hi>Math.</hi> vnto <hi>onely
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13149:100"/>
Faith.</hi> And elſe-where as he is cited by <hi>Caſſander. A Chriſto per fidem remiſsio eſt, quod lex laxare non pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. Fides enim ſola Iuſtificat. Remiſsion of ſinnes is from Chriſt: which could not be releaſed by the Law. For onely Faith iuſtifieth.</hi> Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> runneth the ſame way with <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Hilary</hi> in Comment. vpon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans. Hoc etiam conſtitutum eſt à Deo, vt qui credit in Chriſtum, ſaluus ſit, ſine opere, ſolâ fide, gratis accipiens remiſsionem peccatorum. It is ſo ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in Chriſt, is made partaker of ſaluation, by faith alone, without workes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing forgiueneſſe of ſinnes.</hi> In concluſion, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed vpon all hands, by the moſt lerned in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that many of the ancient Fathers, aſcribe <hi>Iustification vnto Faith alone. Caſalius</hi> in his ſecond Booke, and 16. Chapter, allayeth their ſaying, and we approue it, but implyedly he giueth to vnderſtand, that <hi>Doctores Sancti,</hi> doe affirme, that <hi>ſola fides iuſtificat;</hi> Faith alone is that which iuſtifieth. No new Goſpell therefore, as this Gooſe gagleth.</p>

harueſt of good workes. Now the <hi>valew</hi> of thoſe <hi>workes</hi> is next to be queſtioned, in the point concerning <hi>merit,</hi> and <hi>deſert,</hi> wherein this Gagger, as elſe-where, lyeth out aloofe in ambiguities: for he diſtinguiſheth not of <hi>workes,</hi> nor <hi>merit;</hi> nor the termes how farre they are <hi>meritorious:</hi> nor how they deſerue what they haue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Workes</hi> are conſidered <hi>before</hi> or <hi>after Iuſtification:</hi> In the ſtate of <hi>Nature</hi> or of <hi>Grace,</hi> workes are not all of one kinde. There are ſome <hi>good,</hi> and ſo farre <hi>good,</hi> as that they cannot be done to any euill end. Such as are directed vnto God immediately, to <hi>honour</hi> him, to <hi>loue</hi> him, and to <hi>feare</hi> him. Others ſo <hi>euill,</hi> that no intent or purpoſe can make them <hi>good:</hi> to commit Adultery, doe murther, blaſpheme God. Others good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and in a generality, which may yet be done to an ill intent and purpoſe; to giue Almes to be ſeene of men; euill in a generall notion, as to goe to the Stewes: yet good in the deſignment, to conuert a ſinner. Others indifferent euery way. Now in the Propoſition, not any of theſe are <hi>meritorious,</hi> according to the Doctrine of the Proteſtants, ſaith the <hi>Gagger</hi> generally: Not me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious: what is that? Your Schooles aſſigne vs a two-fold <hi>merit</hi> of Congruity, of Condignity: that, where Retribution, or reward is not due, yet conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency requireth recompenſation: this, where reward is rightly due, and the denying thereof is iniuſtice and wrong vnto the party. Here is no diſtinction of merit at all. We are not giuen to vnderſtand, whether is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Merit of Condignity or Congruity. We know that in the Doctrine of the Romane Schooles (and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13149:101"/>
wee did know it otherwiſe, this fellow would not tell vs.) Merit of Congruity is not commonly meant, as ſcarce vouchſafed the name of Merit. Good workes therefore ſaid to be meritorious, are ſo vnderſtood to be, <hi>ex condigno;</hi> which that a worke may ſo be, theſe Conditions are required. That it bee <hi>morally good: Freely wrought: by man in this life:</hi> In the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> and friendſhip with God; which hath annexed Gods <hi>Promiſe</hi> of Reward. All which Conditions, I cannot conceiue that any Proteſtant doth deny vnto <hi>good workes,</hi> the fruits of Faith, liuely and liuing. For firſt, <hi>euill workes</hi> are rewardable, but with due deſert: that is, Gods wrath, and ſecond death. <hi>Worke, s</hi> ſecondly, <hi>of compulſion,</hi> are not worth Gramercy. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 17. and thirdly, after death, working doth ceaſe. In the ſtate of Grace to be wrought, is the Proteſtants Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, that preciſely hold; firſt, Faith is neceſſary, before good workes can be acceptable to God: For God had firſt reſpect to <hi>Abel,</hi> ſay they, and afterward vnto his Sacrifice. <hi>Deus non habet gratum offerentem propter munera, ſed munera propter offerentem,</hi> ſaith <hi>Gregor. hom. 9. in Ezech.</hi> and then they maintaine, that as God doth Crowne his owne workes in vs, ſo he doth it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing promiſed ſo to doe. This is your owne Doctrine in the Romane Schooles: And ſo farre the Proteſtants, for theſe Conditions, goe along with you.</p>
               <p>Now if your Texts doe contrary this, expreſly, or obliquely, looke you to it: it concerneth you as much as vs. Firſt, <hi>Math. 5. 12.

               <p>In concluſion, touching good workes, the Church of <hi>England</hi> conſidereth them two wayes, <hi>Artic.</hi> 12. 13. Firſt as they are, or may be done before Iuſtification had and obtained; done by men meerely naturall, and in the ſtate of alienation from God: and then as they are done after Regeneration, by the inſpiration and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Gods Spirit. Concerning the firſt, <hi>Workes done before the grace of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Artic. 13. and the inſpiration of his Spirit, are not pleaſing vnto God: for as much as they ſpring not of Faith in Ieſus Chriſt, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they make men meet to receiue Grace: or as the Schoole Authors ſay, deſerue Grace of congruity. Yea, rather for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done; we doubt not but they haue the nature of ſinne.</hi> And ſo our Concluſion is, Good workes thus, and in this ſort, merit not at all, vnleſſe you meane Hell, and Gods wrath.</p>

For good workes done after Iuſtification, which onely and alone are indeed good workes: The Church of <hi>England</hi> in the 12 <hi>Artic.</hi> concludeth thus, 1.

               <p>That <hi>Faith once had</hi> (the propounded Concluſion) <hi>cannot be loſt,</hi> may be interpreted, and is, moe wayes

then one. Whether not loſt at all: whether totally or finally loſt. Men are diuided in this Tenent. Some ſuppoſe neither totally nor finally: Some totally, but not finally: Some both totally and finally. Which is indeed the aſſertion of Antiquity, and your Schoole. Some perceyuing the current of iudgements for the <hi>loſſe</hi> thereof totally and finally; and conſidering alſo at leaſt probability, of Scripture conſenting, put in a new diſtinction, of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Man:</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond cauſes</hi> of Faith and Iuſtification.

But in regard of God, conſidering his counſell and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe vnchangeable, reflecting on his abſolute decree irreuerſable, faith once had cannot totally or finally be loſt, nor they periſh eternally that were endowed therewith.

If the righteous turne away from his righteouſneſſe, and commit iniquitie: and doe according vnto all the abominations that the wicked man doth, ſhall hee liue? all his righteouſneſſe that hee hath done ſhall not be remembred: but in his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion that hee hath committed, and in his ſinne that hee hath ſinned, in them ſhall hee die.</hi> And againe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated with like aſſeueration, and reduplication: <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. againe, <hi>Ezech. 33. 12.

and in time of temptation fall away. Iohn 15. 2. Euery branch that beareth not fruit in mee, hee taketh away. Matthew 24. 12. Becauſe iniquitie ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, the charitie of many ſhall grow cold.</hi> Surely it was hot, that groweth cold: and charitie inlarged, is not but the fruit of a liuing faith, which if it continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in ſtatu quo,</hi> the charitie of many could not waxe cold.

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake not vpon ſuppoſition of impoſſibility, <hi>Yee are aboliſhed from Chriſt, whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer are iuſtified by the Law, yee are fallen from Grace.</hi> For many were ſo, that hauing belieued, and being baptized, did euacuate Chriſt by their owne righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Law. Of whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> complayneth in all that Epiſtle to the <hi>Galathians,</hi> and elſewhere. Nor in point of onely <hi>Hereſie</hi> was <hi>Faith</hi> by them loſt, but alſo of good <hi>liuing,</hi> and conuerſation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. Where thoſe that <hi>had eſcaped the filthineſſe of the World;</hi> therefore waſhed and made cleane, <hi>through the knowledge of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt:</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:13149:105"/>
Therefore iuſtified truely by Faith: are yet <hi>intangled againe therein, and ouercome.</hi> Therefore lapſed from Faith: as is expreſſed <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. and 22. enſuing.</p>
               <p>Infinite are the teſtimonies of Scriptures to this purpoſe, inſiſted vpon by the auouchers. I adde but one of them. <hi>Heb. 6. 4. It is impoſsible, that they which were once enlightned, and haue taſted of the heauenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghoſt, and haue taſted of the good word of God, and of the power of the world to come,</hi> (if theſe were not iuſtified, they know not who were: if theſe had not faith, where was it to be found) <hi>if they fall away, ſhould be renued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine by repentance: ſeeing they crucifie againe the Sonne of God vnto themſelues, and make a mocke of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Scripture ſpeaketh plaine. Their Reaſons from <note place="margin">1.</note> Scripture are euident. Man is not likely in ſtate of Grace to be of an higher alloy then Angels were in ſtate of Glory: than <hi>Adam</hi> was in ſtate of Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: For Grace is but a conformitie thereto, and no conformitie exceedeth the Architype: At moſt it is but an equalitie thereto: and equals are of the ſame proportion. Now if <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, and <hi>Lucifer</hi> in Heauen, did fall and looſe their originall ſtate, the one totally, the other eternally, what greater aſſurance hath any man in ſtate of Proficiency, not of Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation?</p>
               <p>Againe, Faith muſt needes be loſt, where it cannot <note place="margin">2.</note> conſiſt. It cannot conſiſt where God will not abide. God will not abide, where hee is diſobeyed: hee is
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:13149:106"/>
diſobeyed, where mortall ſinne is committed: the moſt righteous man liuing vpon the face of the earth, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually doth or may in this ſort tranſgreſſe: <hi>Who can tell how oft hee offendeth? Cleanſe thy ſeruant from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſinnes. Thou wilt haue no fellowſhip at all with the deceitfull; Nor ſhall any euill dwell with thee.</hi>

                  <hi>Saul</hi> was at firſt the Childe of God: called accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the election of Grace: not onely temporall, <note place="margin">3.</note> for the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but alſo eternall for the heauenly Kingdome. In opinion of Antiquitie thus hee was: and yet afterward hee fell, it is confeſſed; totally all ſay: Eternally theſe ſay, that maintaine iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith cannot be loſt. But if <hi>Saul</hi> were not of Gods Children in grace, inducd with Faith, and the holy Spirit: yet <hi>Salomon</hi> was, there is no queſtion with them, becauſe hee was a Writer of holy writ, and wrote as hee was enſpired by God. If they did not graunt it, the Scripture would euict it. For 2 <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> 7. God ſpeaketh of him literally: though of Chriſt Ieſus, intentionally, <hi>I will be his father, and he ſhall be my ſonne:</hi> And in the 12.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:13149:106"/>
Saint <hi>Peter</hi> without nay: Yet <hi>Dauid</hi> fell foule in that act of murther and adultery, and loſt his Faith and preſent ſtate of Grace: if <hi>Dauid</hi> had periſhed in that his Sinne, what had become of his Soule for euer? It was not poſſible hee ſhould, in regard of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Grace; but had it beene ſo, where had he bin? Surely hee that deſired a <hi>new heart to be created,</hi> had not that heart which he had before his fall: For <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> is production from <hi>not being, vnto being.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was a choſen veſſell of Chriſt Ieſus, and if euer was any, the Childe of God. Yet hee denyed Ieſus Chriſt with an oath, which was <hi>peccatum lethale,</hi> as Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> prooueth in his 66. Tractat. vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> Chirſt prayed for him, that his faith might not fayle: But his Prayer was, for the <hi>end,</hi> not the <hi>act.</hi> That hee might not fall finally, and hee did not: but not that not totally, for ſo hee did. His infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie appeared in his fall: Gods mercy was ſeene in his reſtauration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was an Heretique, an Arch-here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique, the father of Heretiques, and firſt begotten of the Deuill: yet <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was a Chriſtian once, and baptized, and belieued, and brought forth fruits of new life, and followed <hi>Philip</hi> a certaine time. He <hi>belieued,</hi> it is ſaid, but not <hi>truely.</hi> It is not ſaid, <hi>he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued not truely.</hi> Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith hee <hi>belieued,</hi> in the ſame termes, with the ſame words, to the ſame intent and purpoſe, that hee ſpeaketh of others, that belieued truely, &amp; conſtantly: Where the Holy Ghoſt putteth no difference, what man hath any warrant to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh?
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:13149:107"/>
The Scripture doth not ſo much as inſinuate the hypocriſie of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> then: and what is hee, that would haue his <hi>nay</hi> belieued, before Saint <hi>Lukes yea? Iudas</hi> was a Reprobate, and caſt away for euer. Our Sauiour calleth him the <hi>Sonne of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and ſaith it <hi>had beene good hee had neuer beene borne:</hi> Yet <hi>Iudas</hi> was numbred with the twelue A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: had all the Prerogatiues which they enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. God gaue him to Chriſt as well as <hi>Peter</hi> or <hi>Iohn.</hi> And if hee periſhed onely in the number of them that were giuen vnto Chriſt, doubtleſſe hee was firſt ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in that number: and periſhing, ceaſed to be of that number, as ceaſing to be of that number he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed.</p>
               <p>Beſide, if Faith had cannot be loſt, the <hi>Dogge</hi> cannot be ſaid, to <hi>returne vnto his vomit:</hi> nor the <hi>Swine to wallowing in the myre.</hi> If righteouſneſſe had cannot be loſt, why doe wee pray continually againſt that, <hi>Leade vs not into temptation?</hi> Why did the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle chaſtice and bring vnder his body, leaſt he ſhould become a caſt-away? Why ſhould hee admoniſh as hee doth, <hi>Hee that ſtandeth, let him take heede leſt hee fall?</hi> And <hi>Worke out your Saluation with feare and trembling.</hi> Againe, ſay they, totally it may be loſt; for Faith is an adheſion vnto God. Sinne ſeperateth man from God: and maketh a diuiſion in that firſt Coniunction: but by repentance it is againe reſtored, and recouery gayned after fall. Totally loſt, is not then euer finally, eternally, nor ineuitably loſt; For <hi>yet wilt thou returne and refreſh mee, and bring vp
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:13149:107"/>
my life from the gates of death againe.</hi> And as the Tree that is cut downe at the ſtemme, ſo long as the ſtocke remaineth in the ground, yet by the ſent of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it will recouer, (ſaith <hi>Iob,)</hi> and againe, ſhew forth the branches: So, ſo long as men in the Church haue meanes in Chriſt, it is poſſible to be renued by Repentance. Poſſible they ſay. Neceſſary ſay ſome, becauſe of that neceſſitating purpoſe of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee is ſaued, and could not periſh, that was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto life vnchangeably. So then they teach, that are thus perſwaded, Faith totally may be loſt. Faith totally loſt, may eternally be loſt: and alſo not be loſt eternally, though totally for a time. Becauſe God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine will reſtore them to Grace: and except hee would doe ſo, they could not riſe to Grace: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his will is not put into practiſe by his power, he neceſſitateth no man ſo irreuerſably vnto life nor death, thoſe that haue lapſed totally, may alſo periſh finally. It will be vrged by them, which is here ſaid by you, <hi>What needes there any further proofe, where holy Scripture is ſo plaine?</hi> and they graunt in a caſe ſo fully cleared and reſolued in Scripture, no further proofe needeth as neceſſarily required: yet for illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and aſſurance, a concurring aſſent of many is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite of congruitie.

For, where do you find it thus concluded by the Church of <hi>England?</hi> Anſwere on your Honeſty, if you can: nay, bely them you doe, that come ſomewhat to your purpoſe; whoſe priuate opinions you make publique deciſions of Faith. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> your grand Dictator of controuerſies, from whoſe tables you or your Informers haue ſwept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all theſe ſcrappes and fragments, in your bare abbridgement, propoſeth the aſſertion, honeſtly and truly in reſtrained tearms, of <hi>Verè fidelis</hi> and <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatus;</hi> That, not <hi>Euery one,</hi> but <hi>Euery true beleeuer,</hi> ought ſo to be aſſured; that no man is or can bee ſo aſſured, but the man that is iuſtified before God.

               <p>This opinion is an inference vpon that former, of Neceſſity of Election vnto life; and therefore thoſe Proteſtants, who make not the former an Article of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:13149:115"/>

                  <hi>Ambroſe Catharine</hi> was no Baby, as great a Stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler as any in the Councell of <hi>Trent;</hi> in his owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſuperior to moſt; in all mens iudgement, infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to none: who, for ought I knowe, went as farre as any, in particular and ordinary aſſurance of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Before, In, After the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> againſt <hi>Dominicus a Soto,</hi> that maintained the contrary.</p>
               <p>Silly man as you are, you can play in ambiguities, and talk at randome freely, when no man is neere to oppoſe or contradict you. Your Maſters can teach you, that Aſſurance is twofold in this diſcourſe: In reſpect of the Obiect, knowne, belieued; in regard of the Subject, beleeuing, knowing: As man relieth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Euidence; or as is his Euidence to rely vpon. Euidence is diuine or humane, from God or Man. Euidence diuine, if apprehended, is euer certaine, and infallible, both for the neceſſity of our object, God, in whom is nor change nor ſhadow of change; as alſo for the manner of determining the Euidence, whereby that is certaine and neceſſary for effect, which is but contingent otherwiſe in it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Euidence moſt cleere, aſſurance moſt certaine in it ſelfe, is contingent, vncertaine, as we may both vſe it or diſpoſe it, that are heere and there, of and on: becauſe man is irreſolute in his waies, and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:13149:116"/>
in his works. God is to vs, as wee are to him; knowne, as farre as wee can reach to apprehend him.</p>
               <p>Thus then for thoſe men that aſſert infallibility of aſſurance: Their meaning may bee, for ought you know, I am ſure, for ought you haue ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that in regard of God, <hi>faithfull and true;</hi> in reſpect of his promiſes, <hi>Yea and Amen,</hi> euery Childe of God, renued by Grace, may and ought infallibly aſſure himſelfe of his owne Saluation procured in Chriſt: who yet, in regard of his owne Infirmity and Inconſtancy, cannot chuſe but wauer in his aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and feare the worſt, though he hope the beſt.</p>
               <p>This was <hi>Auſtens</hi> reſolution, if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſay right: <hi>Ex promiſsione Chriſti poteſt vnuſquiſque, vt S.

This is enough. Faction may tranſport a man to wrangle for more; but when once they ioyne iſſue, the difference will not be much.</p>
               <p>Much or little, great or ſmall, thus or ſo, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not touched, that deſigneth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Indeed, contrary, as you bely them; conſonant, <note place="margin">Contrary to their owne Bible.</note> agreeing, as they beleeue and maintaine: They neuer went againſt theſe words of Saint <hi>Paul, 1. Cor. 9. 27. Leſt, by any meanes, when I preached to others, I my ſelfe ſhould be a Caſt-away:</hi> But they ſay you miſtake, and miſ-apply thoſe words, and therein goe againſt your owne Directors. For, their <hi>Tenet</hi> is, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was aſſured of his ſaluation: whether by ordinary diuine Faith, or extraordinary diuine Reuelation, I enquire not at preſent, nor much care. I take, which you ignorantly doo contradict, or vnlearnedly doo oppoſe. Secondly, you oppoſe plain Scripture, in your Bibles: for, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> a Iew by birth, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> reſolueth, <hi>ſemper ſe in numero Electorum point, cùm de Praedeſtinatione loquitur,</hi> Rom. 8. 9, 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> Eph. 1. <hi>accounteth himſelf euer in the Roll of Elect, whereſoeuer he mentioneth Predestination,</hi> as in the 8. 9, 11. chapters to the Romans, and 1. to the Epheſians.

So much is That Apoſtle beholding to you.</p>
               <p>They neuer went againſt him that you intend, in thoſe other two Texts of <hi>Rom. 11. 20. Philip.</hi> 2. 12. For to him that continueth faithfull vnto the end, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the reward of eternall life. And yet it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and I could doo it, to puzzle ſuch a Lozzell as your ſelf, with expositions of thoſe Texts that might well put off your application: but I vndertake no priuate opinions or peculiar intereſt. I iuſtifie no man but the Church of <hi>England.</hi> That I can doo againſt your Betters: that I will perform againſt your ſelf.</p>
               <p>A cleanly Put-off, but too common, and therefore <note place="margin">A point of doctrine ſo improbable, that we will not labour to ouerthrowe it by any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof of Fathers.</note>

It ſufficed not; my God, that thou madeſt them thine Angels; thou crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedſt them keepers of the little ones.</hi> The later Schoole runnes mightily the ſame way, though both with ſome differences, <hi>How,</hi> and To <hi>Whom,</hi> and when de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</p>
               <p>Before <hi>Origens</hi> time, (and he liued long within 300 yeeres after Chriſt) as himſelfe relateth, <hi>Tract. 5. vpon</hi> Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> there were two different opinions in the Church: The former maintained, that onely thoſe had Angell-keepers deputed vnto them, who
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:13149:118"/>
were of the number of Gods elect, from the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of their Natiuity: The other, that none but ſuch holy men indeed had Angel-guardians, but from the day of their Baptiſme and new Birth in Chriſt, aſſigned them, not before, or from their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie.</p>
               <p>This was the opinion of Antiquitie, and no more; not as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath enlarged it, that Euery man liuing, good and bad, from the verie firſt inſtant of life, to the laſt gaſpe, hath an Angel-guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian deputed vnto him, as I could make manifeſt, if need were: and <hi>Baſil</hi> is punctuall and expreſſe vpon the 33. <hi>Pſal.</hi> page 221. and the 48. <hi>Pſal.</hi> page 247.

So that, <hi>hic Magiſter non tenetur:</hi> our Roman Vndertakers haue forſaken not alone the Fathers, but their owne Doctor <hi>Peter Lumbard,</hi> to enlarge the point.</p>
               <p>And yet this giddy Gooſe-gaggler muſt prate, he knoweth not what, againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> concerning Angell-keepers in this point: who with as good reaſon, and to as great purpoſe, mought haue ſtirred touching Guardians of Kingdomes, Cities, Corporations, Elements, and ordering of the world; touching the time when, the maner how, the extent how farre, and many other like ſpeculations, all diſputed of among Diuines in the Church, none reſolued of as <hi>de fide</hi> by Diuines for the Church. So that had we denied it, no ſuch great matter: for, <hi>ſalus Eccleſiae non vertitur in iſtis:</hi> the Church may ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt

Thirdly, Whoſoeuer, or whoſe-ſoeuer thoſe Angels were, we find them not in the <hi>Wildernes, among the Tents of Cedar,</hi> or at <hi>Babylon;</hi> but in <hi>Sion,</hi> in the Church, the Chappell, in the Chancell; not onely ſpiritually, in the Church of the Redeemed, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially, in the place of Diuine Seruice, vpon an <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liday; In locoſancto, actione ſacra.</hi> So that theſe are no Rangers amongſt the beaſts of the Forreſt: they haue their ſeuerall walks in the Church-pale.</p>
               <p>That Angell, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 14. is One, a ſpeciall one, an Angell-keeper indeed, Leiger with Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his

Nay, ſay you, <hi>The Church in him,</hi> prouided for him, built vpon him, committed to him. Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s Angel, that great Apoſtle, of him ſpeaketh <hi>Rhode, it is his Angel.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But ſomewhat there was, or the man miſtook. Their Praying for vs may bee conſidered two waies; either in Generall, or in Particular. For the peace of <hi>Sion:</hi> the proſperity of <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church militant in earth; thus in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.

Now this Propoſition, <hi>Holy Angels pray for vs,</hi> doth not limit nor explaine the tearmes, but is ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; as this peddler moſt an end frameth all in his Pack, to calumniate, and to deceiue. Whether <hi>All Angels pray for All men;</hi> or All for ſome men; or ſome for all; or ſome for ſome; who can tell, that was not of counſell to his pen and purpoſe? As it lyeth lurking in fraudulent tearmes, I can anſwere both waies, and contradictory waies. Firſt, <hi>Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels pray not for vs;</hi> and truly too. Nor ſhall this Gooſe <hi>hiſcere</hi> againſt my anſwere, <hi>viz.</hi> Not euery holy Angell in ſpeciall, for euery man in particular; Not at all times, vpon any or all occaſions. I can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo anſwer, and truly too; <hi>Holy Angels pray for vs.</hi> And ſo this Gagger may goe ſhoo the Gooſe. That is, It is a principall part of their performance in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, as they magnifie their Maker eternally, ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend vnto Him, vnceſſantly, the Eſtate and good beeing of the Church of the Redeemed, as yet in great Tribulations. I adde yet further, At all times, ſome of them pray for the particular eſtate of ſome priuate Men, Cities, States, Societies or Countries: And the <hi>Holy Angell-keepers,</hi> for their ſpeciall charges commended vnto their truſt by God, at ſometime, ſome of them for all, for ſome, vpon ſpecial occaſion, employment, or deſignation, as extraordinarily they may and doe vndertake.</p>
               <p>Now to come home to your looſe &amp; laxe affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <note place="margin">Contrary to expreſſe words in your owne Bibles, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11.</note> Your <hi>expreſſe words in our Bible</hi> are not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, as to ſpeake to your purpoſe: that of <hi>Zachar.</hi> 1. 9. 10. runneth thus: <hi>O Lord of hoſts, how long wilt thou net haue mercy vpon Ieruſalem, and on the Cities of</hi> Iuda,

                  <hi>againſt which thou hast had indignation theſe 70 yeeres?</hi> For, it followeth not, becauſe this one Angell prayed for <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in Captiuity, any Angel doth pray for any or euery man.

Your great vnderſtanding doth happely think, Yea: the common reſolution is for, Nay. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer <hi>the praiers of all Saints,</hi> that is, of the Church, were offred to God in the hands of an Angell, their Mediator, therefore <hi>All Angels pray for all men;</hi> or ſome <hi>Angels</hi> for ſome men ordinarily?

The Angell which redeemed mee</hi> (you read, <hi>deliuereth mee) from all euill, bleſſe theſe Lads:</hi> where, firſt, you bely your owne reading. You read, <hi>Angelus qui er uit me.</hi> Is that <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth,</hi> in the preſent Tenſe, in your Grammar? It is to all, but you, in the Time paſt, <hi>that hath deliuered.</hi> Now, what ſuch difference, that it ſhould bee <hi>noted,</hi> betwixt <hi>deliuered</hi> and <hi>redeemed?</hi> indeed, <hi>that hath taken me out.</hi> Secondly, read it how you will, it is not to purpoſe. You propoſe it thus; <hi>That we may not:</hi> you proue the lawfulnes, <hi>quia factum:</hi> ſo you may proue theft, murder, and what not? It is a priuate fact of <hi>Iacob,</hi> there related by <hi>Moſes:</hi> and the Acts, no not of the beſt men, are no rules of actions vnto others. We ſhould liue by Precept, not by Practice.

               <p>Therefore, fourthly, I anſwer contradictorily to <note place="margin">That this was ſpoken to a true An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, and not to Chriſt.</note> your inference. This is not ſpoken <hi>to,</hi> but <hi>of</hi> an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell; ſecondly, not of a created Angel, but of Chriſt. Thirdly, Chriſt is a true Angell. This Fellow muſt
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:13149:124"/>
go learn to ſpeak, before hee write; what to put in Print, before hee publiſh it; to vnderſtand Diuinity, before he babble in it. Is Chriſt an Angell, and not a <hi>true one?</hi> Is he a falſe or a counterfet Angell? in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, in collusion, not in ſubſtance? Who euer heard ſuch Stuffe from a Prieſt's lips? Chriſt is an Angell, not created, a true Angell, of an higher alloy, Prince of Angels, as of men; a mighty Angell, <hi>The Angell of the Couenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this was ſpoken of him by the Patriarch <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob: The God of Bethel,</hi> as hee is called, <hi>that ſpake with</hi> Iacob <hi>in Bethel, and met him there,</hi> who wraſtled with him, who bleſſed him, who told not his name, being <hi>ſecret;</hi> ſpoken of him, by commemoration; not vnto him, by inuocation: <hi>That Angell which deliuered mee, bleſſe theſe.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Wiſely, I warrant you; as if it could not bee auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but he was then prayed vnto, becauſe in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of theſe men, hee was a created Angell: which is no conſequence, except it were granted, that none but created Angels were to bee prayed vnto, on any hand, at any time, vpon any occaſion. Now, who for ſhame will thus reaſon, to ſhame himſelfe, but hee, that eyther is paſt ſhame, or through ignorance
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:13149:124"/>
not capable of it? It is good to vncaſe ſuch a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanke, that he may be knowne what he is. But I go from him, to this, the point in queſtion.</p>
               <p>Theſe Fathers opined, That Angel was not Chriſt, but a created Angel: and what then? As if as many were not of a contrary opinion. But were it not ſo, no more can be collected then this, that in ſome mens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Iacob</hi> ſpake of a created angel; &amp; thence, in ſome mens opinion, not by any expreſſe words of our Bibles, which we were promiſed to haue, this was not Chriſt. Which if it were ſo, as this Gagger can neuer proue it ſo, I will vndertake againſt him if hee dare: yet wee anſwer firſt, Then it was <hi>Iacobs</hi> Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian at leaſt, as <hi>Toſtatus,</hi> and Ieſuites that I haue ſeene, imagine. Now the caſe of Angels-keepers, in point of Aduocation &amp; Inuocation, is much different from other Angels not Guardians; as being continually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant, alway at hand, though inuiſibly: &amp; therfore though we might ſay, <hi>Sancte Angele Cuſtos, ora pro me;</hi> it followeth not, we may ſay, <hi>Sancte Gabriel, ora pro me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But laſtly, heere is no Inuocation nor Interceſſion, nor praying vnto any Angell <hi>Cuſtos</hi> or not <hi>Custos,</hi> ordinary or extraordinarily attendant. It is a deſire directed by <hi>Iacob</hi> vnto God, to ſend his Angel for that ſeruice and employment, to bleſſe &amp; keep thoſe Lads. It is no addreſſe vnto that <hi>Holy Angel,</hi> whoſoeuer he was. Which being ſo, &amp; ſo far from expreſs words pretended, were not this fellow paſt all ſhame, he <note place="margin">Which beeing ſo, who for ſhame can ſay, He pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not vnto him?</note> would ſhame to ſay, <hi>Iacob</hi> prayed vnto an Angel.

To proue himſelfe an honeſt man, it were good this accuſer would name the man. But ſomewhat there is in it, though he cannot tell what. We deny to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe our ſelues in time of need, vnto Angels for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, or interceſſion; and we doe deny it, becauſe we hold it needleſſe, vnneceſſary, as no part of our duty, as vnbehoouefull, &amp; to no purpoſe; becauſe we are perſwaded, that ordinarily, in euery exigent, at all times, no Angel, not attendant without remoue, can take notice of vs, vnderſtand our ſtate inſtantly, pitty vs in miſery, and ſo relieue vs. This is not for any inualidity of power, nor for auerſnes of will. If they know it, they are willing; if willing, they are ſufficient. The want proceedeth not from them: it is from diſability in ourſelues, to acquaint them ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily with our ſtates: which needs wee muſt doe, if wee will looke that they ſhould help vs. This is

As for your ſelfe, I think you are innocent of all. Otherwiſe then ſo, it cannot bee taken. For, though wee ſhould yeeld it, Angels are to bee worſhipped; yet not with diuine worſhip your ſelues confeſſe; with ſuch as is due vnto God alone.

               <p>This was for worſhipping of Angels. S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> ſuccedeth in his Book, <hi>de Viduis,</hi> for praying vnto Angels.

               </p>
               <p>But to purpoſe. We may conceiue your meaning two waies; eyther as in common courſe of kinde, or elſe vpon extraordinary courſe. Apparitions haue been, and may be; but, as works of wonder, diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the right hand of the moſt High. Apparitions are not ordinary, nor of common diſpenſation. And infinite impoſtures, iuggling tricks, and colluſions, haue beene obtruded at all times vpon the world, eſpecially within the laſt 500 yeeres, by coozening &amp; cheating knaues, vnder vaile and couert of Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions; principally, to delude poore ſuperſtitious people, with that opinion of Purgatory, to make merchandize of the pardons. But why not as proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſome Saints haue appeared from Heauen, as ſome Popes haue come from Hell? Both at Gods good pleaſure extraordinarily, who doth all things as hee will in Heauen and Earth. What, if <hi>The ſoules of the Righteous be in the hands of God;</hi> are his hands ſo ſhortned, that no where but in Heauen they can bee in his hands? God may ſend them, no doubt, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily. No ceſſation of pain is to the one; no impairing of happineſſe, vnto the other: they carry
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:13149:127"/>
their heauen and hell about with them whereſoeuer they be. So that, in no diuerſity of opinion, we might well paſſe-by your Texts to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And indeed to no purpoſe: for, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 3. we read, <hi>There appeared vnto them,</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Elias <hi>talking with them:</hi> which apply to your <hi>Theſis, No Saint, deceaſed, hath appeared vnto any;</hi> and aduiſe how handſomely it agreeth thereto. For, doo you not knowe, or haue you heard of it, that <hi>Moſes</hi> by ſome Authors is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not dead? as by <hi>Hillary,</hi> Can. 20. vpon <hi>Mathew;</hi> by Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> in his ſecond Book of <hi>Cain</hi> &amp; <hi>Abel;</hi> but tranſlated by God into Paradiſe, as <hi>Helias</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward: aſſerted of late by no Babies of your owne; <hi>Ioh. Arboreus, lib. 11. Theoſophias,</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe Catharine</hi> vpon <hi>Gen.</hi> 3? If that bee ſo, you may go ſeek a new Text, to prooue <hi>apparitions</hi> of dead men by. It will be anſwered, Theſe were not dead. For, if <hi>Moſes</hi> be liuing, <hi>Elias</hi> is ſure: you hold him yet aliue; and why not both aliue, ſeeing both muſt come, and oppoſe againſt Antichriſt, and bee ſlaine by him before Doomſ-day? Mend your concluſion, and make it thus: <hi>Therefore Saints haue appeared to ſome on earth;</hi> and <note place="margin">Therefore Saints decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearea to ſome on earth</note> I will warrant, no man will quarrell your aſſertion.</p>
               <p>But your ſecond Text of <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 52. cometh home to your minde. They were Saints indeed, deceaſed, but reſtored to life; and peraduenture vnto eternall life, in bodies as well as ſoules. They appeared vnto many; the Text is plain: and I beleeue, you neuer met with any ſuch, that, when you ſhewed this Text, would deny their <hi>appearing;</hi> which is expreſſe. And yet it is not well applied by you: for, your <hi>apparitions,</hi> as I conceiue it (inform me, if I doo miſ-take you),
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:13149:128"/>
are not in bodyes reſtored to life, or raiſed vp out of the duſt, but in bodies aſſumed, or ſome other way. Theſe men appeared in their owne bodies, which were laid into, and roſe vp out of the graues; and ſo, not very fitting your purpoſe.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Onias</hi> the high Prieſt, who beeing dead, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared vnto <hi>Iudas Macchabeus,</hi> let him iuſtifie it that hath written it.

               <p>As your poſition is captiouſly put downe: ſo is your firſt proofe from the Text of <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 29.

                  </hi> knew ſom 2000 yeers after his death. Put the caſe ſo, that <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the Prophets were in the hands of the Iewes, and direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:13149:129"/>
of them in their courſe vnto God: therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> knew what <hi>Rabbi Gamaliel</hi> taught Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſuch a day, in his Auditory. Is this a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence now in your Logick? A coozener, a cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler might reaſon ſo. Yet this is your reaſon, <hi>cap, apee.</hi> I anſwer directly: Firſt, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s caſe is not euery mans. Secondly, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s knowledge might bee extraordinary: our <hi>Quaere</hi> is of ordinary knowledge. Thirdly, <hi>Abraham</hi> might know in long tract of time, which he could not ſo at an inſtant; and wee make queſtion of preſent knowledge: for, that is required vnto your purpoſe onely. That which S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> witneſſeth, we deny not: that which we deny, hee witneſſeth not. Hee witneſſeth there, that <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">At Saint <hi>Auguſt.</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth, Lib. de cura mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis. cap. 14.</note> knew of <hi>Moſes.</hi> He telleth not how he came to know of <hi>Moſes;</hi> nor what <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Moſes</hi> can know touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs.</p>
               <p>In the next, as much ridiculous. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 45, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour there telleth the Iewes thus: <hi>Do not think, that I will accuſe you to my Father.

Therefore, to help it, we haue an argument, a conſequence infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon that Antecedent thus: <hi>How could</hi> Moſes, <hi>dead 2000 yeeres before, accuſe thoſe that were liuing, if the Saints deceaſed, knowe not what paſſeth in the earth?</hi> If ſo; then take heed that <hi>Moſes</hi> accuſe not you for a fool, as very an one, as euer went without the priuiledge of a bable; who ſo childiſhly imagine, that God ſet in

iudgement, the Iewes were arraigned, euery mothers ſonne. And <hi>Moſes</hi> did, as the diuell with <hi>Iob,</hi> came and accuſed them, euery one in particular, of euery crime committed: for ſo it muſt be.

               <p>But good man Wiſeacres, learne of your Maſters, to take things aright. By <hi>Moſes,</hi> is not vnderſtood his <hi>perſon,</hi> then in Paradiſe, dead or aliue; but <hi>Moſes</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that in which the Iewes did ſo much truſt.

So <hi>Caietan, Maldonate,</hi> and who not? or if perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelfe, why then thus they take it: It is his office, it will be performed by him at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and day of Doome: <hi>Moſes</hi> then will ſtand vp and accuſe you.

For the Text, <hi>Irenaeus</hi> inclineth to take it of thoſe Prayers which the Church of GOD offreth vpon Earth, <hi>lib. 4. cap. 33: Quoniam ergo Nomen Filij proprium Patris eſt, &amp; in Deo omnipotenti, per Ieſum Chriſtum offert Eccleſia, bene ait ſecundum vtraque: in omni loco incenſum offertur Nomini meo, &amp; ſacrificium purum. Incenſa autem</hi> Iohannes <hi>in Apocalypſi, Orationes ait eſſe Sanctorum:</hi> which is again repeated by that mvſticall Diuine, <hi>Apocal. 8. And the ſmoke of the incenſe, which are the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Saints, went vp from the hand of the Angell before God.</hi> No more is collected, or can bee, from theſe Texts, but this, that Prayer is compared to Incenſe; according vnto that in the Pſalm, <hi>Let their Praier bee ſet forth in thy ſight like incenſe; and let the lifting-vp of their hands bee as the euening ſacrifice.</hi> But, concluded it cannot be from theſe myſticall Viſions, that theſe Saints prayed vnto that Angell; that the 24 Elders repreſented the Angels; that thoſe Praiers were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed from men vpon Earth; that the Viſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a thing ordinary, and done; that any man of diſcretion or vnderſtanding in Diuinity or common reaſon, would haue gone in hand to haue prooued a thing controuerted and obſcure, by that which is much more obſcure, as this Fellow doth.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Macchab.</hi> 2. 15. 14. thus we read: <hi>This is a louer of the Brethren, who prayeth much for the people, and for the holy City; to wit,</hi> Ieremias <hi>the Prophet:</hi> and from thence the concluſion is, <hi>Therefore they pray for vs.</hi> To weet, you should haue added, <hi>the Prophets</hi> or the <hi>Iewes.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in a Dream, worthy (no doubt) to be beleeued, verſe 11. For, so <hi>Iudas</hi> dreamed, and you beleeue it; and draw vs a Conclusion from your Dream thus:
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:13149:132"/>
                  <hi>Therefore they, Ieremy</hi> and <hi>Onias,</hi> if you will, <hi>pray for vs:</hi> In a Dream too. So the Doctrine is a Dream; the proof, a Dream: a Dreamer related it: a Drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer recorded it; and a Dreamer doth tell &amp; beleeue it. So, <hi>Qui amant, ipſi ſibi ſomnia fingunt:</hi> men are apt to beleeue Dreams, when the Dream is for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Admit it no Dream: let it be a ſtory, and <hi>res geſta. Ieremy</hi> might wel pray for them in generall, as hauing not forgot them in Heauen, whom he did know vpon earth. In ſome particular he might, eyther by extraordinary relation, or Diuine Reuelation, or howſoeuer; and yet you be farre enough from buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your imagined deuice from thence; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may pray vnto them: if yet you were able to make it good, how <hi>Ieremy</hi> then in <hi>Limbo</hi> (for this was before Chriſt harrowed hell, and therefore farre enough from God), could pray for the Iewes, as he is ſaid, who might as ſoone and as wel pray for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, as he might, and were in poſſibility to be heard as ſoone as he.</p>
               <p>For the Text of <hi>Ier. 15. 1. Though</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel <hi>ſtood before mee, yet my minde could not bee towards this people,</hi> I haue acquainted you with what I think thereof elſewhere.

Firſt, <hi>Hierome</hi> in his Comment. ſaith thus, nor more, nor leſſe: <hi>Hos enim legimus, irae Domini pro po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo reſtitiſſe, et iam impendeniem auertiſſe ſententiam. Etſi, inquit, illi ſteterint, vel in conſpectu meo, vel contra me, quorum vni dixit Deus, Dimitte me, et percutiam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum iſtum: tamen non exaudiam, quoniam conſummata ſunt ſcelera populi delinquentis: For wee reade, that theſe men, in the peoples caſe, and their defence, oppoſed against the wrath of God, and put by the ſentence ready to bee put into execution. Although, ſaith hee, that theſe men ſhall ſtand, eyther in my preſence, or againſt me, vnto one of which God ſometime ſaid, Let me alone, and I will ſmite this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: yet I will not heare, becauſe the ſinnes of this wicked people are conſummate.</hi> Now, from which of theſe words doth your wiſdome collect, that <hi>Hierome</hi> made his concluſion, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> beeing both dead, could yet, and alſo did, <hi>pray</hi> for that people? <hi>It is to bee gathered, they did it ſometime.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in their life they did it, it may bee gathered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is cleere. But this, <hi>beeing dead,</hi> is a gloſſe of your owne, an addition to <hi>Hierom,</hi> that corrupteth <hi>Hierome:</hi> It dropt from your pen: hee hath it not. That which is to bee collected from thence, is; If <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> who liuing, appeaſed Gods wrath to the people, were now againe aliue, and ſhould pray for this people, as ſometime they did, yet I would not bee intreated now of them, as I was then; nor giue way to their petitions, as then I did: becauſe now, <hi>The iniquity of the Ammonite is fully ripe:</hi> the <note place="margin">If an Horſe or an Aſſe ſhould pray, &amp;c.</note> ſinnes of this people are now conſummate, which then were but growing in the blade. <hi>Your Horſe</hi> or your <hi>Aſſe,</hi> though like your ſelfe in vnderſtanding,

would not ſo conclude, if, as <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſſe once did, the poore beaſt could ſpeake: as worthily you doe, and like your selfe. <hi>If an Horſe or an Aſſe ſhould pray, &amp;c.</hi> You would haue ſaid, <hi>bray:</hi> that is fitter for ſuch an <hi>Animal</hi> as you.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith leſſe, <hi>Moral.</hi> 9. 12.

And his anſwere thereto is, Becauſe they eſpecially prayed for their perſecutors. This is all that I can finde (no prouender for your Aſſe or Oxe): if you can meet with any more, let me knowe it, and you ſhall vnderſtand my minde thereof; onely this (almoſt forgotten in him, though I put it home to you before), not much to your pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Baruch</hi> 3. 4. thus wee reade: <hi>O Lord Almighty, thou God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>heare now the Prayers of the dead Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> (wee reade, ſay you, <hi>of the dead of Iſrael):</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dead Iſraelities prayed for the liuing; that you, had you been <hi>efemore Iacob,</hi> might not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turne foole.

Some information there they muſt needs then haue had, by ſome Currire: but who was Hee, <hi>Qui fas per limen vtrumque ſolus habet,</hi> that was ſo imployed vnto <hi>Limbus Patrum.</hi> For, the reſolution of your Schooles is, if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doe not miſ-informe vs, <hi>That becauſe the Saints and holy men, who died before Christ came in the fleſh, did not enter into Heauen, did not ſee God, nor could by any ordinary meanes vnderſtand the prayers of ſuch as ſued vnto them; therefore it was not vſed in the old Teſtament to ſay, Holy</hi> Abraham, <hi>pray for vs: but men prayed themſelues by themſelues vnto God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged the merits of Saints that were already dead, that by their merits, their prayers might finde acceſſe.</hi> Thus that great Vndertaker of all Proteſtant Aduerſaries, thereby cutting the throat of Inuocation, Aduoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Interceſſion in the old Teſtament; putting
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:13149:134"/>
you off from all your recited Texts at once, of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruch, Ieremie, Iudas</hi> Dream and all. And what are you <hi>Pumillo,</hi> to that great man-at-Armes? What is your word, that we ſhould beleeue you, <hi>The dead Iſraelites praied for the liuing?</hi> You tould vs of Harps but euen now, out of <hi>Apoc.</hi> 5. 8. You and your Maſters agree as well as Harp and Harrow, and no better, Your ſelf are fitter for an Harrow, than a Harp, <hi>Aſinus ad lyram,</hi> in theſe controuerted points of piety.</p>
               <p>But touching your <hi>dead Iſraelites,</hi> Sir of little wit, and leſſe vnderſtanding, they were not <hi>dead,</hi> though peraduenture ſleeping. <hi>They ſlept not then in the duſt of the earth, beeing gathered vnto their Fathers;</hi> but <hi>dead,</hi> becauſe like vnto the <hi>Dead;</hi> out of minde, caſt off, caſt out, of no reputation; in the opinion of the world, <hi>dead.</hi> Ver. 10. 11. in the ſame chapt. <hi>Men waxen old in a ſtrange Countrey, accounted with them that go down into the pit,</hi> as the Prophet expoundeth his owne mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Theſe were not <hi>Ezechias, Ioſias, Dauid, Eſaias,</hi> or the reſt; but <hi>Ezechiel, Baruch, Daniel, Sidrach,</hi> his companions then aliue. Theſe dead were liuing, and in caſe to pray, and did pray for themſelues, their wiues and children, their Country-men at <hi>Babylon</hi> in captiuity.</p>
               <p>Wee imagine ſo: and <hi>Baruch</hi> himſelf biddeth vs think ſo. Yet <hi>note</hi> what <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaith to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <note place="margin">Where note, that <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret,</hi> para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Baruch,</hi> interpreteth this very place as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques doo.</note> And ſo we will: for, it is worth the noting, if hee knew <hi>Baruch</hi>'s minde better than himſelf. Note it we will, and ſubſcribe it too, if <hi>Theodoret</hi> interpret this place as you doo: for, as for <hi>Catholiques,</hi> I haue not enquired how they interpret it; I need not, it is ſo palpable.

belly, and cry, We <hi>Catholiques</hi> (when it is but a <hi>Caco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> and a poor one, God knoweth, your ſilly ſelfe) interpret the place ſo. But haue you looked vpon <hi>Theodoret?</hi> Are you certain, hee interpreteth it ſo? I cannot finde it, to note it in him. This is all that I can <hi>note,</hi> in no very great Paraphraſe neither; <hi>Verba clarè ostendunt immortalitatem onima:</hi> and to this, Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants firmly and conſtantly aſſent, as well as any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts or Popes either: for, ſome of them haue ſcarce aſſented thereto; though not for this Proof of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret:</hi> which how <hi>clarè</hi> it ſheweth that, I ſee not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theodoret</hi> could not hence note vnto vs the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the ſoule, otherwiſe than becauſe the dead doo liue: which to admit, yet is it farre enough from the expoſition of Catholiques, that imagine, Inuocation may bee inferred hence. For, dead men may pray, and yet not for others. It is an idle excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>If for themſelues, their glory ſhould not bee compleat.</hi> For, doth this <hi>Ignaro</hi> imagine, their glory is yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat? no augmentation to accrue vnto it, at leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall, at the Reſurrection? If he knowe not this, the Catholique Cauſe was very farre forlorne, when ſuch Smatterers ſet pen to paper to propugn it.

                  </gap>te, touching vertue from dead men, thus wee hold: this is our opinion:</p>
               <p>Vertue hath often proceeded from the bodyes, bones, garments, reliques of many holy men and bleſſed Saints, dead and aliue; not ordinarily, or of and from them naturally; but extraordinarily, by diſpenſation, as works of wonder wrought by God. But theſe are not euer to bee had, or ſeene. Such works are of voluntary diſpenſation; and therefore not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, for all, from all, at all times. The red ſea was diuided for <hi>Iſrael</hi> to paſſe. <hi>Iordan</hi> was driuen back more then twice, by <hi>Ioſua, Elias, Eliſeus:</hi> are you ſo wiſe to imagine, ſo ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:13149:139"/>
to proclaime, that all Seas and Riuers may ſo be ſerued. Go try the <hi>Thames</hi> at <hi>Trigge</hi> Staires, or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Wharfe, that the world may take notice of you for a Frantick or an Impoſtor: or the Iewes ſend and hire you to diuide <hi>Euphrates,</hi> at their returne ſhortly vnto the holy Land: For by your reaſon, or elſe you ramble wide, the water ſhould giue you way. For, marke: <hi>Eliſeus</hi> bones did once raiſe a dead man to life; therefore they had vertue iſſuing from them, and reſiding in them: therfore all Saints bones or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques haue vertue that proceedeth from them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually, naturally, when they bee dead: and you, if you haue none, may eaſily borrow ſuch Reliques at the Brokers, to ſerue a turn for the Catholick Cauſe. This is your Logick, if you remember what you haue learned: Any particular may inferre a Generall. Once it was done, it may be euer; at one time, therefore alwaies. <hi>Eliſeus</hi> bones reuiued a dead man: therefore all Saints bones and Reliques can do that or the like.</p>

                  <hi>Acts 15. 14, 15.

But that may bee the Printers fault, not yours. Secondly, heere is no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe mention of <hi>vertue proceeding;</hi> but of <hi>ſhadow</hi> ouer-ſpreading. But you anſwer; <hi>In our Bibles, it followeth, And they all might bee deliuered from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.</hi> But what is that to purpoſe?

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:13149:139"/>
as for our Bibles, they haue not that clauſe indeed; no more haue the Editions of Catholiques, nor the Copies vſed by <hi>Robert Steuen.</hi> The old Tranſlator, I doubt not, found it in his Copie, and did expreſſe it: ſo would wee haue done, had we found it in ours: for wee left it not ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, nor doe you ſay ſo, of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But fourthly, let it bee added; for wee grant it true: it is not <hi>ad idem:</hi> for you propound it of the <hi>Dead,</hi> and prooue it of the <hi>Liuing.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was then aliue: betwixt <hi>Liuing</hi> and <hi>Dead,</hi> there is a maine difference: the one may doe what the other cannot, in my learning.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, admit Saint <hi>Peter</hi> then dead, becauſe his ſhadow was no ſubſtance: <hi>vertue</hi> is <hi>immanent,</hi> and <hi>emanant;</hi> and both, two waies conſidered. Naturally and ordinary: or by diſpenſation and extraordinary. It was no naturall quality in his ſhadow: and as for endowments of diſpenſation, they are particular, and reſtrained; now in beeing, anon, not. From no Saint <hi>departed</hi> or <hi>aliue,</hi> from no ſhadow or ſubſtance, doth any ſuch virtue iſſue naturally? From many aliue and dead, great vertue hath extraordinarily at times, vpon occaſions, for ſpecial ends, by diſpenſation. And what then? Therefore your Reliques can doe the like? If this be the conſequence, I deny it. Elſe, becauſe the Apoſtles could ſpeake with tongues, our Prieſts and Ieſuites can doe the ſame. Doe it, and I yeeld. But experience prooueth true, you cannot now ſay, <hi>Ariſe and walke.</hi>

               <p>What you cannot doe for Saint <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſhadow, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſhall help at a dead Lift to bring the Text home. <hi>Ser. 39. de Sanctis,</hi> hee ſaith, <hi>If the ſhadow

of his body could help, how much more the fulnes of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?</hi> I will not quarrell the Authority, nor the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, though I may: how the allegation ſhould ſerue for reliques, I cannot ſee; except the <hi>Fulnes of power</hi> bee his Relique, oppoſed to the <hi>ſhadow of his Body:</hi> and that indeed is made a Relique of Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> and it is the beſt that euer he left, worth all his other Reliques whatſoeuer; and therefore deſerueth to bee kept charily in the Popes Wardrobe. But that is a Relique of another kinde: we ſpeake of no ſuch Reliques now.</p>
               <p>Relique or not: what <hi>expreſſe</hi> mention? None, nor regarded. For the man hath recourſe vnto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, in ſtead of expreſſe mention, and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thus: <hi>Saint</hi> Auguſtine <hi>ſuppoſeth two things: The one, that the ſhadow of his body, beeing heere on Earth, did both help and heale infirmities: which Proteſtants Bible leaueth out.</hi> And ſo did Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Bible, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt.

               <p>The other thing <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> by Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> is, <hi>That beeing in Heauen, hee can ſtill help vs by his Power.</hi> And what Power? how help vs? Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> doth not; and you, I think, cannot reſolue vs. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer

It is <hi>ſer.</hi> 29. in which this paſſage is; not 39, as you miſ-report it: which is a Counterfet vnder S. <hi>Austen</hi>'s name, as the Louaniſts, and other your owne men, obſerue.</p>
               <p>There is a Commemoration of <hi>Saint</hi> Peter'<hi>s chain:</hi> you keep an Holi-day in memory thereof, <hi>Auguſti</hi> 1: and yet <hi>Saint</hi> Peter'<hi>s Chain</hi> (as <hi>Baronius</hi> obſerueth) was not found vntill Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> was dead. Had the man been as he would ſeem, Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> yet might hee haue been deceiued in his collection, as wel as in ſomewhat elſe noted by <hi>Lorinus,</hi> that hither tendeth.

from them, and the euill ſpirits went out of them.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what? Vertue proceeded from Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he was dead? I deny that: for, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was then aliue, and aliues like. Therefore this is for the liuing, not the dead. And yet take mee not ſo, that I deny the thing.

that thoſe bleſſed Soules themſelues, by ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace and diſpenſation of God, took notice of that generall Act of the whole Church, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied their deuotions, with their own beſt aſſiſtance vnto the Maieſty of Heauen.

The miracles, memories, reliques of Saints in your Romane Church, are all of them knowne to bee iuggling tricks of deceiuing knaues: and if Saint <hi>Martin</hi> were aliue againe, hee might finde out onely one mans Reliques, but many thouſands to bee the bones of theirs that died at the gallowes for their ſinnes; nor of Martyrs, that ſhed their bloud for Ieſus.

               <p>See your Fathers I need not. I haue ſeene them often, before euer I ſaw <hi>C. W.

But I take no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at that originall, as you would doe with vs for much leſſe aduantage.

But now, ſaith hee, <hi>Hee that toucheth the bones of a Martyr, ſomewhat partaketh of ſanctifying power, by that Grace which aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the body.</hi> This was true in thoſe times: but thoſe Martyrs are not: thoſe bodies are gone: that grace is neither diffuſed nor effuſed at this day.

               <p>The later Church abuſed this practice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, imploying it as <hi>ſpells</hi> or <hi>amulets</hi> to caſt out di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, to heale diſeaſes, to keepe men from danger; whereto nor God nor man had deſigned it antiently.

One man peraduenture thought ſo, that the children of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:13149:146"/>
the Faithfull that were in Chriſt, might ordinarily be ſaued without Baptiſm. I ſay peraduenture: for, it appeareth not, that he held it of ordinary courſe, nor referred it to the Parents faith, but vnto that Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy Seed;</hi> as euen <hi>Bellarmine</hi> his Aduerſary confeſſeth touching him; who yet is nothing vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Touching the neceſſity of Baptiſm, there hath bin variation euer in the Church; and yet euer a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity held vpon all hands, more or leſſe. For, Antiquity ſupplied the want of water, by blood. Martyrs, not baptized, went to heauen. The ineuitable want of water, by the Spirit; in deſire and aſſured faith, if it might bee had, in Chriſt the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of it. For, as in little Infants, the faith of the Church, and thoſe that preſent them to be baptized, is by God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted their owne: ſo the willingnes and deſire of the ſame Church, of their Godfathers and Parents, is reputed theirs. So that no abſolute neceſſity in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Antiquity, and indiſpenſable, was held of our Sauiours Aſſeueration, <hi>Except a man bee born anew of water and the holy Ghoſt, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of heauen.</hi> Which neceſſity, thus qualified by Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, ſome late Writers haue qualified further vpon other grounds; as namely, that ſuppoſed Decree of God, touching abſolute neceſſity of ſaluation: which admitted, yet includeth a ſubordination of meanes. As <hi>Paul</hi> and his company were determinately ſaued from periſhing by ſea; yet he told them, it could not be, except the Sailers ſtaied: ſo nor Gods Decree be accompliſhed without means, which is <hi>water</hi> and the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> ordinarily.</p>

Others, it may be, haue qualified it from the ſtate, faith, and intereſt of their parents: which, if it be ſo, is but a priuate opinion of ſome men; not the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of this, or any Proteſtant Church that I knowe. You would bee loth to maintain all priuate opinions in the Church of Rome. The moſt that wee haue ſaid thereof, is, <hi>Of the will of God to impart his grace vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>

                  <hi>infants without Baptiſm: in that caſe, the very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of their naturall birth may ſerue as a iuſt argument. Whereupon, it is not to be miſ-liked, that men, in charitable preſumption, do gather a great likelihood of their ſaluation: to whom the benefit of Christian parentage being giuen, the reſt that ſhould follow, is preuented by ſome ſuch caſualty as man hath no power himſelf to auoid.</hi> So that the most this Fellow can impute vnto vs, is, that In ſome caſe of <hi>ineuitable</hi> and <hi>inunicable neceſsity,</hi> little infants may bee charitably ſuppoſed ſaued by their parents faith. And ſo that of <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 5. for neceſſity of <hi>water,</hi> will iuſtifiably bee anſwered, <hi>If it bee poſsible to attaine it.</hi> That of <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5. vrgeth no more, but that <hi>the waſhing of Regeneration</hi> is the ordinary entrance into life.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 14. (to admit all paralleld in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion and Baptiſme) all were not damned that died vncircumciſed; nor all caſt away, that die vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, as this Fellow himſelf will or muſt grant; but thoſe that neglect, contemn, or omit the meanes which may bee had. As for <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. the very words doo ſupport this mitigation: for, though Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Hee that beleeueth, and is baptized, ſhall bee ſaued;</hi> yet he doth not ſay, <hi>Hee that is not baptized, ſhall be damned:</hi> but, <hi>Hee that beleeueth not, ſhall bee damned;</hi> that being euery way of indiſpenſable neceſſity; this

ſometime tolerable, the rather, becauſe we are plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught of God, that <hi>The ſeed of faithfull parentage is holy from the birth;</hi> which the children of Pagans are not: theſe hauing an habituall intereſt and conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God in their parents, which the other want.

               <p>The Primitiue Church vſed, I deny not, this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall reſtraint in ſome caſes, to ſome men, vpon ſome occaſion: they might ſo doe, without tax or blame: and ſo may you or wee, for ought I know, with moderation or diſcretion. So the queſtion is not, <hi>Whether Prieſts may marry?</hi> but, Whether it bee conuenient for them ſo to doe? You ſay no, neuer, at no time. Wee deny this rigor, and leaue it indifferent to their owne diſcretion; reſoluing, that at ſome time, for ſome cauſes, it is conuenient, and to bee permitted: to ſome men, at ſome time, for ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, it may be denied to marry.</p>
               <p>Your Church, for reasons beſt known to her selfe, though apparant enough to all, hath a long time doa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon <hi>ſingle life</hi> of Prieſts, for I cannot ſay <hi>chaste;</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:13149:159"/>
and the better to ſecure her ſelfe of that ſtate, hath laid a tye of conſcience, a band by oath vpon them; admitting none to holy orders, but ſuch as firſt ſolemnly take that vow: which hath many times &amp; often filled your Churches with knaues and dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes abundantly; honeſter men, and diſcreet Scholars, refuſing ſuch a tye.</p>
               <p>Wee aduiſe you not to break your vow, perſwade not your ſelues ſo: we counſell and aduiſe you by all meanes to keep it, &amp; liue honeſt: marry freely, if you be free; if not, we ſay not to you, Do as <hi>Alexander</hi> did with <hi>Gordius</hi> knot; Cut it in pieces, when you cannot vndo it. It was ill to vow ſo vnaduiſedly; worſe, to force you to it on no neceſſity, yet worſe to break it ſecurely with preſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: butworſt of all, <hi>adhinnire</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter freſh maidenheads, or neighbors beds co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually.</p>
               <p>We ſay, you did ill to vow abſolutely, that which was not in your power to performe: a miſchief paſt, that cannot bee remedied, muſt bee relieued what it may. If you haue vowed, keepe it on Gods name: it is ſinne to breake it, I make no queſtion of it, which was deliberately, diſcreetly, poſſibly promiſed, in things not againſt nature, common right or reaſon; for euen in a bond, a condition euill, impious, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, is voyd and bindeth not, they ſay.</p>
               <p>I deny not vowes in the new Teſtament, they may bee meanes vnto, and parts of Gods worſhip, as well in the new Teſtament as the old. So <hi>Gregory Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> impoſed a vow vpon himſelfe, not to take the name of God in vaine, and kept it: So haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other lawfully and profitably done: doe you ſo, and we commend you for it.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Propoſition of two feet, neither relying vpon either: <hi>The ſoules of the Fathers</hi> might not bee thence deliuered, <hi>though Chriſt deſcended into hell;</hi> and Chriſt might very well go down into <hi>hell,</hi> and yet not deliuer any Fathers thence; as finding ſome other work there to doo; and, hauing other cauſes of his deſcent, finding no Fathers to deliuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:13149:161"/>
For the former part of this Poſition, that <hi>Hee went not into hell;</hi> with what face, what fore-head, can this Fellow ſhew wee teach it, when in our Creed wee profeſſe, that <hi>He went down into hell,</hi> and haue pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely defended it againſt oppoſition! Nay, wee more beleeue it, than the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth; and are more punctuall in it, than are they.</p>
               <p>They quarter out hell into foure Regions; <hi>Hell</hi> of the <hi>Damned, Purgatory, Limbus Infantium,</hi> and <hi>Limbus Patrum.</hi> This diuiſion, without warrant of holy Writ, be it granted them; into which of theſe Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, into all, or into ſome, did the ſoule of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, ſeparate from his body, deſcend? Say they, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hell of the Fathers onely, <hi>really;</hi> into the other parts, <hi>virtually,</hi> or by effects. Thus <hi>Thomas:</hi> and who dare deny him? Thus the Current of their Schools. This is their <hi>Tenent,</hi> and no otherwise.</p>
               <p>Wee profeſſe and beleeue, that Chriſt went into <hi>hell,</hi> that is, that the humane ſoule of our Sauiour, in the <hi>Interim</hi> of ſeparation from the body, did <hi>eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> and <hi>really</hi> go downe into hell, the place of the Damned, and of the Diuels; not alone into <hi>Limbus</hi> of the Fathers, which was not there; not to ſuffer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing there at all: for, all ſuffrings ended vpon the Croſſe. In the Land of darknes, and ſhadow of death, began the firſt ſtep of his exaltation; that, <hi>free among the Dead,</hi> he walked where he would, not being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sined to any place; that he took reall poſſeſſion of a part of his Kingdome, and preſented his perſon vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe his vaſſals; hauing beaten his enemy in his chiefeſt hold, chaſed him out of the caſtle of his ſtrength, triumphed ouer him in himſelf, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:13149:161"/>
confuſion vnto his foes, that would not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his mercy in time of life, nor partake of grace offred them vnto repentance. This is our belief con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his deſcent into hell; if not orthodox, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and receiued, let this wrangler ſhew where, how, and we will yeeld vnto better diſcretion from Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
               <p>It is idlely ſuppoſed, that, the deſcent granted, we muſt needs inferre withall a <hi>Limbus Patrum,</hi> or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance of the Fathers out of hell; there being alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (not contrary to Scriptures, nor Analogy of faith; not inferring impiety, impoſſibility, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, abſurdity, or contradiction) ſo many true, good, and catholick reaſons of our Sauiours deſcent thither, beſide this.</p>
               <p>The Fathers he meaneth, are the Patriarchs and Prophets, and righteous men, that liued and died before Chriſt came in the fleſh; that expected the Promiſes, and beleeued in hope, but enioyed not the fulneſſe which we doo ſince. Being dead, they are conſidered two waies; in regard of ſtate, in reſpect of place. For place, the Scripture runneth in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tearms: <hi>In the hands of God; In</hi> Abraham's <hi>Boſom; With their people;</hi> and ſuch like; thus affirmatiuely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining no certaine place: negatiuely reſoluing, they were not there whereas now they are, in the higheſt heauens, and glorious, where the Body of Chriſt reſideth, exalted aboue all Powers and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>He first entred into the moſt holy place by his owne bloud. They without vs were not to bee perfect; ſtanding the firſt Tabernacle, the holiest of all was not yet opened.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:13149:162"/>
The way was new,</hi> which he prepared for vs. The gates to be opened were <hi>eternall gates,</hi> neuer opened ſince they were gates; but gates, and eternall ſhut gates together. Therefore wee profeſſe with holy Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> euery day in our Liturgie, <hi>When thou hadſt ouercome the ſharpnes of death, thou didst open the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heauen to all Beleeuers.</hi> This, we acknowledge, is the receiued opinion of the fathers, and (for ought I knowe) of Proteſtant Diuines not a few.</p>
               <p>Though they were not in <hi>heauen,</hi> in regard of <hi>place;</hi> yet were they in <hi>happineſſe,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>ſtate. The ſoules of the Righteous,</hi> ſaid he, before Chriſt came, <hi>are in the hands of God: and no kinde of torments ſhall once touch them.</hi> This is alſo the conſented doctrine of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. If <hi>no kinde of torment,</hi> then not <hi>loſſe,</hi> nor <hi>paine;</hi> then not in <hi>hell:</hi> for, I neuer heard of hell without all manner pain. So it followeth not, in opinion of the Antients, the ſoules of the Faithfull were not in heauen aboue properly; therefore they were in hell properly. Gods hands, in which they were, are not ſo ſhortned; his Kingdome is not ſo narrowed, but that hee might well haue moe places than one; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles, Repoſitories, Reſting-places, for the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, where hee would diſpoſe them, enow, could we be content.</p>
               <p>Curioſity will not ſtay heer, but proceed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Where were they then? In what place of the world was their abiding? I anſwer, I cannot reſolue that: for, the Scripture hath not determined it. <hi>Neſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cire velle, quae Magiſter maximus docere non vult, erudita eſt inſcitia: It is learned neſcience, Not to knowe what our grand inſtructer will not teach.</hi> It is enough to knowe,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:13149:162"/>
they are in better caſe now, than they were then. With Chriſt they entred into his Reſt. Euer they were in the hands of God, though not euer in like diſtance or proportion with God. So what need we wrangle about the place, if the matter bee agreed touching ſtate? See how contrary to our owne Bibles.</p>

Heerupon you think wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he muſt needs mean the pains of Purgatory, and no other. It is the doctrine of your owne Schools, that ſuch as were raiſed at any time from death to life, were not certainly doomed, nor confined into their ſtations: but, in regard GOD foreſaw they ſhould liue again, extraordinarily he ſuſpended their determination, this way or that way irreuocably. Why might not Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> mean ſome ſuch thing? Without doubt he did not mean it of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.

For, Saint <hi>Thomas, 3. p. q. 52. ar.</hi> 8. reſolueth, that the ſoules of Purgatory were not freed nor deliuered by Chriſts deſcent thither; his merit extending vnto eternall deliuerance, and vnto no partiall or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall freedome. But, ſomewhat you would ſay, though poor man you be to ſeek, in the manifold labyrinths of Purgatory, <hi>Limbus,</hi> and Hell: out of which, wiſer than you cannot winde.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Hell</hi> is ambiguous in the Writings of the Fathers. Sometime it is put for the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; ſometime, for the place and receptacle of ſoules; and that in a different manner, in oppoſition to a twofold heauen. For, earth is reſpectiuely called <hi>Superi,</hi> and the ſtate of men liuing, by the ſelfe-ſame name: and ſo in oppoſition, any Dead are <hi>Inferi;</hi> and their place and receptacle, <hi>Infernus.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri</hi> is the higheſt heauen: and they that do liue there, are ſo ſtiled. In oppoſition heerto, the name of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feri</hi> hath a two fold interpretation. Firſt, for a place or ſtate contrary to the ſtate and place of the higheſt heauen: this is hell properly, or of the Damned. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for a ſtate or place negatiuely oppoſed, and not contrary to heauen: and ſo euery place and ſtate which is not that higheſt in the higheſt heauen, is called <hi>Inferi;</hi> and may ſo be, as <hi>Pamelius</hi> hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vpon <hi>Tertullian,</hi> leſt you take it for a Proteſtant deuice.</p>
               <p>This Fellow perchance knew not this before: and therefore whereſoeuer the Fathers ſpeak of Chriſt's deſcent into hell, and carrying thence the Fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the higheſt heauens, hee faineth <hi>Limbo</hi> vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, euen as the Bell tinketh whatſoeuer the foole
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:13149:165"/>
thinketh; when the Fathers meant nothing leſſe then ſo, but alteration of ſtate, and place. See then as many places as the booke will hold. They may prooue the deſcent of Chriſt into hell; which, as an Article of our Creed, wee willingly embrace. The deſcent to Popiſh <hi>Limbus</hi> they doe not prooue: the which no Father euer dreamed of, in that ſort as our Maſters tender it vnto vs to bee beleeued at this day.</p>

               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> cannot poſſibly vnderſtand this place of your <hi>fire</hi> of Purgatory, except hee will and doe contradict him: For by your owne confeſſions, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> conceiued it of the Tribulations of this life; therefore not of Purgatory after this life. The words you meane in Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon 37. <hi>Pſal.</hi> are, <hi>It is ſaid, Hee ſhall bee ſaued, yet as it were by fire. And becauſe it is ſaid, Hee ſhall bee ſaued, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that fire is not regarded. No maruell: and yet that fire is more vnſufferable then any torment which a man can poſsibly vndergoe in this life.</hi> Heere (no doubt) the game is vp for Saint <hi>Auguſtine. Fire</hi> after this life, and yet not eternall: therefore of Purgatory, no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Yes, Sir, a queſtion. Indeed no queſtion what Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> meant. For firſt, he calleth it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Emendatorium ignem,</hi> fire that correcteth men, and maketh them better. Purgatory is not so: it is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall onely. There is no merit in Purgatory: ſoules cannot ſinne nor deſerue there, in the reſolution of your owne men. Secondly, the <hi>fire</hi> which Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> meaneth, doth then, in his opinion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that office, when the ſheepe are ſeparated from the goates; that is, when your Purgatory, in your owne opinions, is no more for euer. Thus the ordinary Gloſſe vnderſtood Saint <hi>Auguſtine. Wee read,</hi> ſaith the Gloſſe, <hi>of two fires that ſhall come. The one eternall, which eternally ſhall torment the reprobate: This fire is to inſue the Iudgement. The other fire ſhall goe before, which ſhall burne vp the ſurface of this world, and ſhall amend them that haue builded wood, hay, and ſtubble.

But if an vnbeleeuer doe a good worke, it will profit him heere, by deliuering him from euill, and God will returne vnto him good for his worke: But in that world to come, his work will profit him nothing. For neither is hee ranked, for that his worke, with other beleeuers, and that deſeruedly, becauſe hee did that good, out of naturall good motions, and not for Gods ſake. Wherefore hee receiueth his reward, both in and for the body, not in or for his ſoule. Alſo if a Chriſtian ſhall giue vnto no Christian, hee ſhall therefore receiue no great reward, becauſe hee gaue it not vnto a Chriſtian, nor as vnto a Christian;</hi> Toby <hi>ſaying,</hi> Poure out thy wine vpon the ſepulchers of the iuſt, and giue nothing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſinner. <hi>Whoſo giueth a little to an vnbelieuer, hath his reward: but he that giueth any thing to a beleeuer, hath a double reward: firſt, in as much as hee is Gods Creature; ſecondly, becauſe hee is iust before God. But whoſoeuer giueth vnto an vnbeleeuer, hath onely a ſingle reward; in as much as the vnbeleeuer is Gods Creature, though in will oppoſite vnto God. If a Christian doe receiue no Christian, but an Infidel in the name of a Chriſtian, haue his reward notwithſtanding appointed for him hee ſhall; becauſe, as much as lieth in him, he receiueth indeed no Christian, but as a Chriſtian.</hi> It was neceſſary I ſhould, as I haue done, ſet downe the whole place at large, both that the

Again, ſome take Baptiſm for affliction: men afflicted vnto death, what ſhall they doo, if the dead riſe not again? Some referre it vnto a Iewiſh cuſtome; by which, if a man had died polluted, another was clenſed and waſhed for him; that ſo beeing dead, hee might get aduantage by it. This Iewiſh Fable may happely look vpon your Purgatory: and much good may it doo you. Yet farther, <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> relateth vpon this place, that when any of the Catechized among the Marcionite Heretiques died, a liuing body was laid vnder the Beer; and the queſtion propoſed vnto the Party, If he would be baptized? for you knowe, the <hi>Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni</hi> were <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, vnbaptized. The Party anſwered for the dead man, Yes, I will: and so was hee bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed for him. And thus they expounded Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> by <hi>dead,</hi> vnderſtandeth the <hi>body of man.</hi> If there be no Reſurrection, to what end is the body baptized? <hi>Epiphanius</hi> laſtly, and moſt men,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:13149:170"/>
commonly take it for the baptizing of the <hi>Clinici,</hi> as they called them. Men in thoſe times vſually defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Baptiſm vntill their death, and <hi>in extremis</hi> would be baptized. So to be baptized for the <hi>Dead,</hi> is to be baptized, when men are ready to dy: which they not doe, but vpon hope of the Reſurrection. In ſuch variety, and greater than ſo; yet ſaith this fellowe, <hi>An euident place.</hi> To come home to the aſſertion, It is plaine and euident, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh not of any ſuccour that ſoules departed receiued from the Suffrages of the Church (which were it granted, no neceſſity of Purgatory would enſue), but of comfort that men receiued from that mayne point of our moſt holy faith, the Reſurrection of the Dead; the mayne Subiect of that Chapter, as euery child with vs can tell.</p>

               <p>And for the honour in kinde or correſpondency; what ſimilitude betwixt that &amp; yours, to an Image? You fall down vnto an Image, at leaſt, before it.

<pb n="310" facs="tcp:13149:178"/>
in your relatiue worſhip. Did <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Ioſuab</hi> ſo <hi>honour</hi> the ground? Fell they downe vnto it? Put they their ſhooes off to it? for the grounds ſake, and not rather for the preſence of God there; whom, without any relatiue worſhip at all, they honoured immediately in himſelf? Any thing, I ſee, will ſerue a Prieſts turn. No matter what you prate, ſo that you prattle. Happy men that haue ſo pliant Proſelytes, that ſo eaſily beleeue whatſoere is told them, though it be a tale of a Tub.</p>
               <p>There is a reſpect due to all the works of God; as <hi>good,</hi> as <hi>his,</hi> as arguing the art and excellency of the Maker: ſo all of them are <hi>honourable</hi> in their kindes.

               <p>Be it the <hi>Arke:</hi> worſhip and adore it, if you can finde it; worſhip any thing like it, any Image for it, if you can bring ſo good warrant for your ſo doing, your adoring thereof, as is this, <hi>Adore the footstoole of his feet.

So take it as you will, or as you can, out of <hi>Arke</hi> will proceed no Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip; nor yet from vpon the Arke, any Images.</p>
               <p>The Iewes did worſhip Images vpon the Ark. That is no warrant for you to do ſo; nor yet precedent to take it ſo. They worſhipped <hi>Baalim,</hi> and the Hoſtes of Heauen, <hi>Milcom</hi> and <hi>Moloch.</hi> Will you doe the like?

               </p>
               <p>You bely the Iewes, they did not worſhip them. For they could not come to worſhip them. The Arke was reueſtried in the moſt holy place: No Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite came thither to adore it: onely the High-Prieſt had acceſſe thither: He onely once, but one day in the yeare, and but one time in that day.

But I may miſtake, for I cannot tell what to make of in his Epiſtle to <hi>Marcellan.</hi> When you ſpeake more plaine, I ſhall bee able to giue you a fuller anſwer: till then, I proceed.</p>
               <p>From Images, to, I cannot tell what to giue vnto it, but it is, <hi>the name of Ieſus,</hi> ſomwhat ſtrangely car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vnto <hi>Adoration,</hi> Philip. 2. 10. <hi>That at the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus euerie knee ſhould bowe, of things in Heauen, things in Earth, andof things vnder the earth.</hi> Vpon which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes the concluſion is.

So there is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the one, none for the other: leſſe reaſon of alleadging this text of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for ratification of Image-worſhip.</p>
               <p>In the Brazen Serpent there is more reſemblance. It may be a warrant for making an Image, no warrant <note place="margin">Num. 21. 8.</note>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:13149:180"/>
for worſhipping an Image made, nor for making ordinarily: becauſe that was made by ſpeciall direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a ſpeciall end, againſt a generall practice vpon precept, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make any grauen I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</hi> God may ſo diſpenſe with his own Law, where, when, in what ſort, and to whom hee will; but not wee.</p>
               <p>The firſt obſeruation then, out of this Text againſt <note place="margin">Hence are euidently prooued di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, &amp;c.</note> the Proteſtant, that God <hi>commanded the making of this Image,</hi> is idle: neuer Proteſtant made queſtion of it: nor of the ſecond, <hi>that it was ſet vp for a ſigne:</hi> nor the third, <hi>that the lookers vpon it ſhould receiue health:</hi> nor the fourth, of exempting the practice comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, from the breach of the firſt Commandement.

               <p>This Serpent was beheld, not adored by thoſe that looked on it, though it had a reference vnto a great myſtery, and was a Rememoratiue of ſaluation extended by the Sonne of God. Vnleſſe it were ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, it is to no purpoſe alleaged. For <hi>making</hi> is one thing: this may be done. <hi>Adoring</hi> another thing: that is vnlawfull. Therefore <hi>Saunders,</hi> and <hi>Catharine,</hi> and <hi>Saunders,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doe maintaine, adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was giuen vnto it. <hi>Vaſques</hi> denieth it, and that iuſtly: for when they began to adore it, the good <hi>Ezechiah</hi> brake it in pieces. But yet <hi>Vaſques</hi> muſt yeeld it was adored, or elſe, that it is alleaged to no purpoſe to prooue Adoration.</p>

Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> is of later date then Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and of leſſe credit by much in controuerted queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

Saint <hi>Chryſoſtom's</hi> Maſſe is not intirely his: many things haue beene added in tract of time: no man will deny it, that knoweth any thing: this bowing to the Image is one of those additions: and yet in ſome editions there is no mention of any Image: if there bee, it doth not come home, to iuſtifie that in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereby worſhip is giuen to ſtocks and ſtones, and ſuch worſhip as indeed is Gods pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar.</p>
               <p>Images and Idols may be two things: theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and impious, neuer tolerable: thoſe not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, and ſometime profitable, eſpecially reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of Stories: Images were vnlawfull vnto the Iewes at all, the very ordinary and ciuill vſe and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of them, except by ſpeciall warrant, in ſome place: as in the Temple, vpon the Ark, which though perhaps not obſerued, yet is true, and apparant to any man that aduiſedly ſhall read <hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Ioſephus.</hi> Vnto Chriſtians they are not vnlawful, for ciuil vſes: nor vtterly in all manner of religious imployment. The pictures of Chriſt, the bleſſed Virgin, and Saints may be made, had in houſes, ſet vp in Churches: the Proteſtants vſe them: they deſpight them not. Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and honour may be giuen vnto them: the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants doe it: and vſe them for helps of piety, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration, and more effectuall repreſenting of the Prototype.

<pb n="319" facs="tcp:13149:182"/>
Saints, Chriſt. If this you call <hi>Dulia,</hi> we giue it too. But whatſoeuer you ſay, howſoeuer you qualifie the thing with gentle words, wee ſay, In your practice you farre exceede, and giue them that honor which is <hi>Latria:</hi> a part of diuine reſpect and worſhip. So not wee. Let practice and doctrine goe together, wee agree. So that the queſtion is not, <hi>What may bee giuen them?</hi> but, <hi>What is giuen them?</hi> You muſt then change the ſtate, and prooue, that what you doe, is not any way, any iot or part of diuine honour, but meerely ciuill reſpect, <hi>Dulia.</hi> This you cannot doe, ſo long as your people go to it with down-right adoration, and your new Schooles defend, that the ſame reſpect is due vnto the Repreſentee, as muſt be giuen to the repreſented. So that the Crucifix is to bee reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the ſelf-ſame honor that Chriſt Ieſus is. A blaſphemy not heard of, till <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> ſet it on foote. Cleere theſe enormities, and others like theſe, then come, and wee may talk and ſoone agree concerning honor and reſpect vnto Reliques or Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Saints, or Chriſt: till then, we cannot anſwer it vnto our Maker, to giue his honour vnto a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

               <p>But to conclude with your Fathers, that affirme God knoweth what: you are to prooue, which yet wee deſire you not to doe, for there is no ſuch neede againſt vs; that <hi>It is not ſuperſtitious, nor yet ſuperfluous to repeat one and the ſame Prayer oftentimes.</hi> For this <hi>Lactantius</hi> is, cited <hi>lib. 4. de diuinâ inſtitut. cap.</hi> 28. but might haue beene ſpared. In that Chap. he diſputeth againſt that deriuation which <hi>Cicero</hi> gaue, of <hi>ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioſus;</hi> That they were called <hi>ſuperſtitioſi, qui totos dies immolabant et precabantur, vt ſui liberi ſibi ſuperſtites eſſent.</hi> For ſaith hee, <hi>Quid mihi afferet cauſae, cur precari pro ſalute Filiorum, ſemel religioſi, et idem decies facere, ſuperſtitioſi eſſe hominis arbitretur?</hi> What reaſon can <hi>Cicero</hi> giue mee, why it ſhould bee counted religious piety to pray once; and ſuperſtition, to pray often? <hi>Si enim ſemel facere, opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:13149:186"/>
eſt; quanto magis ſaepius?</hi> Which teſtimony is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect as may be, for praying often, but not for ſaying the ſaid prayer often: yet this ſhould be proued, not that. This is after the Puritan Cut, not that. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, it may touch our Factioniſts, who regard n o Fathers: it concerns not vs, who reſpect the one, &amp; vſe the other: who profeſs, with the same <hi>Lactantius, Multiplicata obſequia demerentur potius, quam offendunt.</hi>

               <p>The next is S. <hi>Amb. lib. de Sp. ſanct. cap.</hi> 20. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you haue playd the Idle-pack, Addle-head, <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro,</hi> or Negligent in the course of your book: yet, as good Orators in a bad cause, lay the ſtrength they haue or can make, in the beginning, and latter end, ſo ſhould you: but who can haue more of a cat, then her skinne; of a Blunderer, then that which is next hand? Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> wrote three bookes to <hi>Gratian</hi> the Emperor, <hi>de ſpiritu ſancto.</hi> This poore Innocent knew no ſuch matter; ſuppoſing, hee had wrote but one; nor caring, vnto whom hee wrote it. Saint <hi>Ambroſe lib. de ſpiritu ſancto, cap.</hi> 20. ſaith, Who can tell what? I ſay, Who can tell? For, the firſt booke hath 20. Chapters iuſt: in the 20. nothing is that tendeth this way. In the second book there are but 12. There can bee nothing in any 20. Chapter there. The third hath chapters 23. but nothing touching repetition of Prayers, or Prayers at all. The truth is, beſide theſe bookes, there is in ſome editions another tract with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chapters at all; a very very ſhort one, <hi>de ſpiritu ſancto;</hi> by some ſuppoſed, a fourth book to be added vnto the other three; by others, a ſeuerall, headleſſe diſcourſe, none of Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doing: howſoeuer it be, whoſe-ſoeuer, it ſhould ſeeme the book which

the man would deſigne. For, not farre from the end, hauing recited that text of Eſay 6. <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabbath,</hi> hee inferreth the cuſtome of the Church for the <hi>Triſagium</hi> in their ordinary Letany; <hi>Vnde etiam tractum eſt, per omnes fere Orientales Eccleſias, et nonnullas Occidentales, vt in oblationibus ſacrificiorum quae Deo patri offeruntur, vna cum ſacerdote, voce populus vtatur, id est, Sanctus, ſanctus, ſanctus, Dominus Deus Sabaoth.</hi> Which very words wee vſe in our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing of the holy Communion thus: <hi>Therefore with Angels, and Archangels, and the company of Heauen, wee laud and magnifie thy glorious name, euermore pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thee, and ſaying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, Heauen and earth are full of thy glory.
