            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ONe of the great Faults, which the witty <hi>Erasmus</hi>
pleasantly taxed <hi>Luther</hi> with, was this, <hi>That he
medled with the Monks Bellies:</hi> for indeed, that zealous
Reformer did smartly inveigh against the Pride, Idleness,
Luxury, Voluptuousness and greedy Covetousness of the
then Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rgy. I have of late been also drawn to <hi>meddle
a little with the Priests Bellies;</hi> the Occasion for which
was thus offered, by one of themselves.</p>
            <p>Somewhat more than two years ago, a Book was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
by a Nameless Priest, bearing the Title of <hi>A
Friendly Conference between a Minister and a Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioner
of his inclining to</hi> Quakerism, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the
latter part of which, he made <hi>Tythes</hi> the Subject of his
<hi>Conference.</hi> When I had read that Book, and had
observed, that, in some parts of it, the Author there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
had greatly abused, and mis-represented the People
called <hi>Quakers;</hi> in others, had endeavoured to deceive
his Reader by Sophistical and Fallacious Arguments: I
writ an Answer to the whole, under the Title of <hi>Truth
Prevailing, &amp;c.</hi> which I divided into several Chapters,
according to the various Subjects treated of, the last of
which was <hi>Tythes.</hi> This, pinching the Priests in a
tender part <hi>(the Belley)</hi> made them bestir themselves,
and lay their Heads together, to consider what was to
be done. After divers Debates, and much Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:65611:3"/>
(as I have been in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormed) about it, another Book
(written by another Hand, but without a Name too)
at length came forth, entituled, <hi>The Right of Tythes
Asserted and Proved, &amp;c.</hi> being an Answer to that one
Chapter only of <hi>Tythes,</hi> which though it was the <hi>last</hi>
Chapter in my Book, yet having the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>chiefest</hi>
place in the Priests Minds and Affections, obtained
from them the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>chiefest</hi> Defence. Some time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
came out another Book, said to be written by the
Author of the <hi>Conference,</hi> who was not willing yet, it
seems, to trust the World with his Name. This bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Title of <hi>A Vindication of the Friendly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
&amp;c.</hi> (and divided into like number of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with mine) seems to be designed for a general Reply
to my Book. The former (called, <hi>The Right of
Tythes)</hi> came first to my Hand, and was about half
dispatcht before I saw the latter. I therefore chose to
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke the Chapter of Tythes out of the latter (so much,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mean, of it as seemed Argum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntative, or pertinent to
the purpose) and clap it to the Book of Tythes, as
being of the same Subject. To both these the Book in
thy Hand is intended for an <hi>Answer:</hi> how well it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth
that Intendment, is left to thee, Reader, to
judge.</p>
            <p>If thou art a <hi>Tyth-Receiver</hi> of any kind, there is
great danger lest <hi>Interest,</hi> mis-guiding thy Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
should hinder thee from discerning Truth,
and so from judging truly. For that of the Poet.</p>

a Friend in</hi> York <hi>(to me unknown) in which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
me,</hi> That my Book having gained Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
there, Endeavours were used to prevent
its further Service, by casting out a Report
that I was a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> at least, that I was no <hi>Quaker,</hi>
but had a mind to shew my Parts and Learning, &amp;c.
<hi>(The like Rumour also, of my being a</hi> Jesuit, <hi>was craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
spread in</hi> Nottingham-shire) <hi>Hereupon to shew
the Vanity of their</hi> Slander, <hi>I thus writ in that Letter,</hi>
—Some (thou sayest) will needs have me to be a
<hi>Iesuit;</hi> and why? because of a little Learning:
must none then have Learning but they and <hi>Iesuits?</hi>
This is the common, but poor shift of Priests hard
beset; when they cannot maintain their Ground,
they cry out, Their Opponent is a <hi>Iesuit,</hi> as if none
could be too hard for them, but <hi>Iesuits,</hi> by whom
to be worsted they are not ashamed to think it no
shame, the more shame for them. Well, Truth is
too hard for them and <hi>Iesuits</hi> too. <hi>And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
Whatever they in their Carnal minds may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

to ascribe to my self or my own Abilities any of that
Honour, which is due to the Power of Prevailing
Truth.—<hi>Iudge, Reader, whether from those Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
my Opponent had any just ground to tax me with
bragging of my Learning.</hi>

            <p>This, Reader, is the Language wherewith he treats
me; notwithstanding which he hath the confidence
to Brand me with Railing, for calling Tythes <hi>the Priests
Delilah, the very Darling and minion of the Clergy:</hi>
This he sayes is <hi>Ill Language,</hi> pag. 11. <hi>and Scurrillity,</hi>
pag. 12. which he will not meddle with. But if this
be ill Language and Scurillity, by what Name I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
shall that Language of his pass, which is before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited!
Doubtless if Railing be not Reasoning (as he
truly sayes) his Book is so replete with Railing, that
there is little room for Reasoning in it. And though
he terms that expression of mine Scurrillity, and sayes
he will not meddle with it, yet can he not forbear, but
in the very next page catches up this which himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts

ill Language and Scurrillity, and throws it at
the <hi>Quakers,</hi> calling <hi>Tythes the</hi> Quakers <hi>Delilah the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Darling and Minion of that Sect,</hi> pag. 13. And so
transported he is with passion against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that
he sees not the absurdity he runs himself upon, in taxing
the <hi>Quakers</hi> with railing at Tythes in the very same
Line, wherein he calls <hi>Tythes the</hi> Quakers <hi>Delilah, the

<hi>a Creature.</hi> Again in pag. 5. <hi>I judge it necessary to lay
aside all Considerations of the</hi> MEANNESS <hi>of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary.</hi>
And when he hath a mind to <hi>throw dirt</hi> on

use the help of his <hi>invention,</hi> and suppose things not in

can it reasonably be supposed that I did charge the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Friendly Conference with want of hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in respect of my self? Can he imagine I took that
Book to be designed as an Onset upon me! nothing is
more irrational. Again, he sayes, pag. 17. <hi>It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
you laid aside this Weapon</hi> (of the divine right) <hi>not
out of any distrust of the Argument, nor out of any great
Opinion of your Adversaries skill;</hi> How weakly is this
argued, for a man of so great Learning! One of my
<hi>scantling</hi> of understanding might happily have spoken
as pertinently as this. The Author of the <hi>Friendly
Conference</hi> did not lay aside the Weapon of divine
right, out of any great Opinion of his Adversaries
skill: Why, did he know what skill his Adversary had
<hi>before he try'd it?</hi> Nay, did he know before-hand, or
could he fore-see who his Adversary should be? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
either this great Learn't man in the <hi>wantonness</hi> of

to fasten on me an imputation of self-conceit, and stick

               <hi>also,</hi> pag. 115. which very Page of my Book detects
his <hi>unfair</hi> dealing, and clearly convicts him of <hi>manifest

regard has he to speaking Truth, that he charges me
with gleaning it out of <hi>Fisher.</hi> But this is not the only
instance of his unfair dealing by me, as I shall have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
hereafter to shew.</p>
            <p>He seems highly offended that I called <hi>Tythes the
Priests Delilah, the very Darling &amp; Minion of the Clergy.</hi>
What ever Reasons induced me so to call them, I think
he hath sufficiently proved that I therein exprest my

Truth, though somewhat unadvisedly; and 'tis

            <p>§. 1. TO make out the Divine Right of Tythes,
there are three Periods (he sayes, p. 19.)
to be considered? 1. Before the Law; 2. Under the
Law; 3. The Time of the Gospel. <hi>Concerning the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st Period, before the Law,</hi> sayes he (to his Dr. Sr.)
<hi>you said very little in your Conference, as not designing to
mannage this Argument.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But why did he say so little? Was it not because he
had</hi> but little <hi>to say, and as I observed in my former An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi>
Though he pretended to be a Minister of the Gospel,
yet he took the Law for the surer holding, <hi>and therefore
betook himself chiefly to that? No, sayes this Priest
(to excuse him)</hi> 'Tis evident you laid aside this Weapon
<hi>(of the divine Right)</hi> not out of any distrust of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
but in very Truth you seem to have been loath to
cast Pearls before Swine, who understand not the value of
them, <hi>pag.</hi> 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Was his Parishioner then a Swine with whom he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursed

            <p>He hinted indeed before (pag. 6. of his <hi>Friendly

declared them arrant <hi>Swine,</hi> not considering that he

            </p>

                  </gap>cedent</hi> to
any positive Constitution, why began he at the human
Right? Or if he intended only to mannage the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of humane Right (as this Priest intimates for
him, pag. 20.) why did he meddle with the divine
Right? but seeing he gave a touch on each, why am I
blam'd for answering both? He had<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Reason the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have begun with the divine Right, and to have
insisted on it too, and have mannaged that Argument
(if he understood it) in as much as he began his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
upon a Passage taken out of a Book of <hi>E. B</hi>'s,
which related to the divine Right, not to the humane.
Yet had he said nothing of Divine Right at all, it may
be I might have said the less; but seeing he thought fit
to say so much as might intimate a reserve for a divine
Right, I think I had reason to examine the claim, and
not as <hi>easily grant,</hi> as he did <hi>weakly beg</hi> the Question.</p>
            <p>But he sayes, he perceives his Brother Priest had
mentioned, that <hi>the divine Right of Tythes was derived
from</hi> Melchizedeck, <hi>not from</hi> Levi. He's very angry
I fell upon this Passage, and to vent his Passion bestows
upon me the badge of a <hi>skulking Adversary:</hi> Why so?
Because <hi>this Passage</hi> (he sayes) <hi>was single, not guarded
with any Proofs or Reasons, stood naked, was an open
place.</hi> Whose Fault was that? Did he expect I
should have guarded it with Proo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and Reasons for
him? or that I should have been so mannerly as to have
past it by because it was not guarded? He would not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65611:11"/>
it seems have had me enter there, because it was an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
place. Surely if I had meddled with nothing but
what was guarded with Proofs and Reasons, I should
have had little to meddle with; for his whole Book is
either u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>guarded or ill guarded.</p>
            <p>But he would perswade his Reader, pag. 17, 20.
<hi>That I had triumphed over this naked Sentence,</hi> (as he
calls it) <hi>and over the Author too;</hi> nay, <hi>that I had boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
I had disproved clearly the divine Right of Tythes;</hi>
for which, the better to hide himself, he assigns no page
of my Book; nor do I know any Passage in it, from
which, without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> positive Resolution to abuse me, he
could draw such an unfair inference. The most I said
(that I remember) was in pag. 282. and the words
these, <q>That Tythes were not paid by <hi>Abraham</hi> to
<hi>Melchizedeck,</hi> but given, and that but once, and
that too upon an Accidental Occasion, nor then out
of his own proper Estate (but out of the Pillage of
<hi>Sodom,</hi> which he by the Sword had recovered from
the Plunderers) I think I need not stick to say I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

considering what I had before offer'd in the four pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding

judge.</p>
            <p>§. 2. My first Opponent in his <hi>Friendly Conference,</hi>

due to the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood, until they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to be paid; but after they were commanded
to be paid, they become due; and so long as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
stood in force,</q> it was an Evil to detain them.
But we do not find, throughout the Scriptures any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from God that Tythes should be paid unto <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck.</hi>
Upon this the Author of the Right of
Tythes sayes, pag. 20. <hi>My first words do declare, I do

            <p>But I believe, either this Priest doth not understand
the Question, as the other stated it; or else he thinks
the other Priest did not understand how to state it as
he should do; and therefore he hath undertaken to state
the Question anew. The Case was plain enough to be
understood before; and I am content to abide the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
Censure, whether by my Answer to it I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

how this man Eighteen Moneths after would alter it,
no more then I now do how another of them Eighteen

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s hence may vary it again, if this mans work
succeed no better then the former. The former Priest
said, <hi>The divine Right of Tythes was derived from</hi> Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedeck.
Now because no Right could be derived
from <hi>Mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>deck</hi> to another, which was not first in
<hi>Melchizedeck</hi> himself, I thought it justly inquirable,
<hi>Whether or no Tythes were ever due to</hi> Melchizedeck?
And because no certain and positive Evidence could be
produced of <hi>Melchizedeck</hi>'s Right to Tythes, I judg'd
it necessary to consider what way Tythes might come
to be due to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> him, and therefore said, <hi>that which should
make them due must be a Command.</hi> This also I demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nstance from the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood, to
whom it is on all hands acknowledged they wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> due,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65611:12"/>
after they were commanded to be paid to them, not
before; therefore I said, <q>They were not due to the
<hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood, until they were commanded to
be paid; but after they were commanded to be paid
they became due: and so long as that Command
stood in force,</q> it was an Evil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to detain them. This the
Priest was willing to dash out, lest as the Right of the
Levitical Priesthood to Tythes, depended upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Command, so an equality of Reaso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> should drive
him to seek a Command, on which to ground <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedeck</hi>'s
Right to them also, which he very well knew
he could no where find.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He attempts therefore to mend the matter by a</hi> new
stating <hi>of the Question: And whereas the other Priest
had asse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ted, that</hi> the Divine Right of Tythes was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived

Tythes do not make them originally due either to <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck</hi>
or <hi>Levi,</hi> but to God himself, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To whom Tythes were <hi>originally</hi> due, was not the
Question; but from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>vine Right,
which the former Priest asserted to be <hi>from Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck.</hi>
He does not claim Tythes from God, to whom
they were originally due; but from <hi>Melchizeck,</hi> to
whom how they became due, and from whom have
they come to be due to these Priests, had well become
him to have proved.</p>

being no where commanded by God to pay
Tythes, as the <hi>Iews</hi> expresly were. But the <hi>Christian</hi>

receiving the Goods of this World from the

them, as not to abuse them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 31. when both
in eating and drinking, and whatsoever else he does,

'Tis not to be doubted but that God, from whose
Bounty and Blessing all is received, might reserve to
himself what share he pleased; but what he might do
is one thing, what he did another: That he ever did
appropriate the tenth part, I find not in Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,
excepting only in the time of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
for which there was a particular Reason. He
then chose the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation to be his peculiar People,
which People being divided into twelve Tribes, he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
one entire Tribe, the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> to attend
the Service of the Tabernacle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> The Land of <hi>Canaan</hi>
he divided amongst the other e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaven Tribes, but gave
the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> no Inheritance amongst them, <hi>Numb.
18. 20, 23, 24. Deut.</hi> 10. 9. for they being wholely
imployed in that service, could not have leisure to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the Plough, or other Rural Occupations. Seeing
therefore he had excluded them from a share of the
Land (the manuring of which would have taken them
off from the Service he had designed them to) and that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65611:13"/>
by this means their Brethren, the other Eleaven Tribes,
amongst whom their part was shared, did all fare so
much the better, their respective Lots bein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> so much
the greater, he commanded the Eleaven Tribes that
had the Lands, to pay the Tythes of the increase there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
out of whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this twelf Tribe should be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And while that Priesthood and Polity stood, which
Tythes were suitable and appropriated to, this Tything
Command was in force, and no longer. But that eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
God did reserve the tenth, or command the payment
of Tythes to any, before the constitution of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical</hi>
Priesthood, or since the Dissolution thereof, I
no where read in Scripture. This is proper for the
Assertors of the Divine Right of Tythes to prove, and
indeed so absolutely necessary, that if they fail of this,
all they can say beside will be too weak to bear their
Title up: For in a matter of so great moment, it is
not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>are Conjectures or meer Suppositions, nor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
neither, will serve the turn, but positive Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.
The <hi>Levitical Priesthood</hi> was not left to such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties.
Though this Priest is willing to take it for
granted, that the men of that Age wherein <hi>Abraham</hi>
lived, knew and understood by the Light of Nature,
that the tenth part belong'd to God, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be paid to his Priests: yet we find God himself
did not think fit to hazard the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood on
such uncertain terms, but secured their Maintenance to
them by an express Command, which left no room for
any Doubts or Scruples. And can it be imagin'd, that the
Omm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>scient God, whose Eye at once fore-sees all Events,
would leave the Maintenance of his Gospel-Ministry,
so much nearer to him then the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood,
to depend upon the ambiguous and doubtful Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a single Act of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s, or a Vow of <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65611:14"/>
uncertain when, or where, or how performed?
No doubtless, it cannot reasonably be supposed, that
he who took such particular Care of the Legal Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
(which was to last but for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>) and was so
punctual in appointing Tythes for their Maintenance,
not thinking either <hi>Abraham'</hi> Gift or <hi>Iacob</hi>'s Vow
sufficient ground for them to claim upon, although they
were the cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en Priests of God, without a plain and
positive Command, would leave his Royal Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
the Publishers of his Everlasting Gospel, so ill
provided of a Claim to Tythes, as to be necessitated
to strain a Title out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Gift and <hi>Iacob</hi>'s
Vow, if he had ever intended Tythes should be the
Maintenance of his Gospel-Ministers.</p>
            <p>What else doth this Assertor of the divine Right
of Tythes offer in proof of his Assertion, but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures
and Probabilities, as he calls them, as in page
30. where speaking of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s giving to God the
tenth of all the Spoils, he adds, <hi>As in all Probability

Tythes, shew as plainly (if they can) when God did
appropriate to himself the Tythe or Tenth Part, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
from the other nine, before the time of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical</hi>
Priesthood, for whose Maintenance he then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
it. Can it with any colour of Reason be
supposed, that he who so precisely and punctually set
down the very day whereon he chose to himself the
First-born, which related but to that typical state of
the <hi>Iews,</hi> would have given no hint, nor left any Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
at all of his Right and Claim to Tythes before the
Constitution of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood, if he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
sanctified them to himself before, and intended
them to be continued after the Dissolution of that
Priesthood, for a Maintenance to his Gospel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters!</p>
            <p>§. 4. <hi>The Priest sayes, pag.</hi> 22. Though God have a
right to the tenth part of our Substance, yet he cannot be
his own Receiver: So that we are to enquire who must be
Gods receiver, and for that, even Reason will teach us,
that what is due to the Master, ought to be paid to his
next and immediate Servants, <hi>that is,</hi> to his Priests.</p>
            <p>What he is not able to prove, that he is willing to
take for granted. I acknowledge that God, who is
Lord of all, hath a right to all our Substance, and may
command and dispose the whole, or what part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he pleaseth: But that God hath a distinct right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o
the Tenth, more then to all or any of the other nine
parts, and that by the Law of Nature, anteced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rt, is more
then I have yet seen proved either by this, or any other
of the Assertors of the divine Right of Tythes, that
I have hitherto met with. And till this be proved, 'tis
needless to inquire who should be the Receiver:
Though even in that also, the Priest falls short, taking
that to be a dictate of Reason, which right Reason did
never dictate to him: for what is due to the Master,
ought to be paid to such of his Servants, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he appoints
to receive it, whether they be his next and immediate
Servants or not: for it is not their being next unto him,
that doth authorize them to be his Receivers, but his
deputing them unto that Service.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again he sayes, pag.</hi> 23. Abraham, in paying his
Tythes (which were Gods part) unto <hi>Melchizedec</hi> the
Priest of the most high God, did confirm this dictate of
Reason, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What else is this but begging the Question, and that
twice in two lines. He supposes <hi>Abraham</hi> paid his
Tythes (which the Scripture no where saye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he did)
and that Tythes (as Tythes, as a distinct part) were
then Gods part, (which the Scripture no where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
they were) and if this would be granted him, he
would then infer that <hi>Melchizedec</hi> had indeed a
Right to Tythes, and perhaps also that from him a right
to Tythes might be derived to a Gospel Ministry. But
he runs too fast to hold that of which he is willing to
make no question, is the main Question in this part of the
Controversie, namely, Whether in <hi>Abraham's</hi> time,
and antecedent to any positive Constitution, Tythes as
Tythes, or a Tenth part <hi>distinct</hi> from the rest, was any
more Gods peculiar part, then the other Nine: And
whethers <hi>Abraham</hi> in giving (as the Texts express it)
the Tenth of his Military Spoils to <hi>Melchizede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,</hi> did
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65611:16"/>
               <hi>pay a just debt</hi> to <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> which he could not
<hi>without injustice</hi> have with-held; or whether that
gift of <hi>Abrahams</hi> was a grateful acknowledgment, and
<hi>voluntary</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eturn of kindness to <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> for his so
friendly Congratulation, Fatherly blessing, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
present of Bread and Wine to himself and his
weary Followers: This is indeed the sum of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the very thing on which (and which alone) a claim
of Tythes from <hi>Melchizedec</hi> to any others, can with any
reason be supposed to turn. And if my Opponents, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
first or second, would stick to this, and (though
but for a while) deny themselves the pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
they seem to take in railing and reviling, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and jeering, insulting and boasting, disdaining and
scorning; and would apply themselves to mannage this
Argument with that gravity &amp; seriousness that becomes
the Subject, I should not doubt to see this Case brought
to a speedy and fair Issue. But then I should expect to

               </gap> upon my words, <hi>first,</hi>
in making me to say I do not read in <hi>Genesis,</hi> &amp;c. As if

gross. <hi>T. E's</hi> saying, he doth not read <hi>that</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham

            <p>These words are not in my Book, but are a meer ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice

               </gap>
more plain, then that I all along deny that <hi>Abraham
over</hi> paid Tythes <hi>at all.</hi> This is an <hi>art</hi> this Priest is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
at, but I'll assure him 'tis a <hi>black one,</hi> and will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
credit him or his Cause. He served me so once or
twice before, in his 16. page, quoting me thus, Tythes
were wont to be claimed as of divine Right, but I
find this Priest is not hardy enough to adventure his
cause upon that Title. Whereas my words are not,
I find this Priest is not hardy enough; but I do not find
this Priest hardy enough. Which variation how small
so ever it may seem to some, yet as Illiterate as he takes
me to be, I understand the different sense of those two
Expressions, and how little he is to be trusted; which
I am the more confirm'd in from his next Period,
where speaking of me, he sayes, He perswades his <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
that they who were wont to claim Tythes <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These words were not in my Book, but a suggestion
of his to abuse me; for which (whatever I think of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers)
I have cause enough to think him more bold
then honest. Nor has he only gleaned on this passage,
but insisted deliberately on it, and presented his false
suggestion to the highest advantage he could make of
it. For he sayes, <hi>Let us therefore see who and what

directed in all their Actions: yet in an Action of so
great moment as this is made, from which so large a
claim and weighty Title is derived, it may reasonably

Divine Wisdom, by which he writ, intended Tythes
to be a Gospel-Maintenance, and to be claimed from

                  </gap>edec</hi> Tythes;
which as it was done upon an accidental Occasion, so
<hi>Moses</hi> runs over it, as briefly as may be, giving it only
a transient touch: And indeed, the whole Passage seems
to be but a kind of Parenthesis; for in the 17th Verse
<hi>Moses</hi> says, <hi>The King of</hi> Sodom <hi>went out to meet</hi> Abram
(after his return from the Slaughter of <hi>Chedorlaomer,</hi>
and of the Kings that were with him) <hi>at the Valley of</hi>
Shaveh, <hi>which is the King's Dale.</hi> Then in the next
Verse, he mentions Melchizedec; <hi>And</hi> Melchizedec,
<hi>King of</hi> Salem, <hi>brought forth Bread and Wine: and he
was the Priest of the most high God.</hi> Vers. 18. <hi>And he
blessed him, and said, Blessed be</hi> Abram <hi>of the most high
God Possessor of Heaven and Earth.</hi> Vers. 19. <hi>And
blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine
Enemies into thine hand. And he gave him Tythe of all,</hi>
Vers. 20. This is the full and whole Account which
<hi>Moses</hi> gives of this matter; and then immediately in
the next words resumes his Discourse of the King of
<hi>Sodom,</hi> Vers. 21. <hi>And the King of</hi> Sodom <hi>said unto</hi> Abram,
<hi>Give me the Person<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

How could he have mention'd this Passage of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
giving Tythes in fewer words, and with less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark!
which cannot reasonably be imputed to the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of his History, by any one that shall duly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how copious he is upon other Subjects, setting down
at large even the smallest Circumstances, as besides the
former instances, will plentifully appear in the story of
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s Servant fetching a Wife for <hi>Isaac, Gen.</hi> 24.

               </gap>el both him and his Brethren there. But this is an
Art the Priest hath, to perswade his Reader there is
more in this Passage then the brevity of the History
would give room to express. The History was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by <hi>Moses,</hi> who was <hi>inspired thereto</hi> by God, and
as it is <hi>irrational</hi> to imagine that this Passage of <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>braham</hi>'s
giving Tythes to <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> would have
been past over so lightly, and left so bare, if it had had
relation to future Ages, &amp; that in the Times of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
a Right to Tythes was to be derived from hence
(as the Author of the <hi>Friendly Conference</hi> says it is,
pag. 135.) so it is great Impiety to suggest that any
thing was here omitted, which it was necessary for the
Church of God to know and understand. The Spirit
of God hath said expresly, Abraham <hi>gave Tythes</hi> of
all. The Spirit of God hath said expresly, It was <hi>the
Spoyls</hi> which <hi>Abraham</hi> gave the Tenth of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 4.
And who is man, that he should take upon him to add
or alter! Darest thou say he pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he gave! Darest thou say, it was of his <hi>own Substa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce,</hi>
when God says it was of the <hi>Spoyls!</hi> Darest thou say,
he did this <hi>ordinarily,</hi> when the Spirit of God hath
thought fit to mention this <hi>one only extraordinary time!
Add thou not unto his Words, lest he reprove thee, and
thou be found a Lyar,</hi> Prov. 30. 6.</p>
            <p>§. 6. <hi>But he says, p.</hi> 29. To give and to pay is all one
in this Case, or else the Apost<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e was over-seen, who not
only saith he gave the Tenth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 4. but, <hi>Levi</hi> paid
Tythes in <hi>Abraham, Vers.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Neither is to give and to pay all one in this case, nor
yet was the Apostle over-seen: for the Apostle most
properly accommodates his Speech to the <hi>several</hi> times
it had relation to. When he speaks in Vers. 4. of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65611:20"/>
in whom it was a <hi>free</hi> and voluntary <hi>Gift,</hi> he
uses the word <hi>Gave,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> had done before him;
but when in Vers. 9. he speaks of <hi>Levi</hi> (whom he figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively
mentions, with an [as I may so say] for he
speaks not personally of <hi>Levi</hi> himself, but of his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring,
the <hi>Levitieal</hi> Priest-hood who received Tythes
which <hi>Levi</hi> never did himself) then I say, <hi>refering to
the time of the Law,</hi> in which God had commanded the
payment of Tythes, he expresses himself by the word
<hi>Gave.</hi> So that it is manifest he <hi>varied</hi> his Expression
according to the persons he treated of, and the <hi>different
times</hi> his Speech had relation to. When he speaks
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who lived <hi>before</hi> Tythes were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be paid, he sayes he <hi>Gave, vers.</hi> 4. But when he
speaks of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priest-hood, who lived <hi>after</hi>
Tythes were commanded to be paid, he alters his
phrase, and sayes he <hi>Paid, vers.</hi> 9. Abraham <hi>gave,</hi>
Levi <hi>paid,</hi> which distinction the Apostle needed not have
used, had he understood (as this Priest does) giving and
paying to be all one in this case.</p>
            <p>It is very proper <hi>(he sayes)</hi> to say, We give a man that
which is his due, <hi>pag.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p>That must be understood in such cases only, where
the due is altogether certain and unquestionable, such
as are the instances he has given of <hi>David</hi> &amp; <hi>Hez<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one whereof saith, <hi>Give unto the Lord the honour due
unto his Name, Psal.</hi> 29. 2. The other commanded
the People to <hi>give the Priests their portions, 2 Chron.</hi>
31. 4. Neither of which admitted any doubt, since e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one knew that Honour was due to the Name of the
Lord, and none could be ignorant that Tythes were
due to the Priests, then the Law of God expressly speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. But in a case of so great ambiguity as this
claim of Tythes from <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> which is so utterly

void of all certainty, that the very terms it is exprest in,
must confirm at least, if not constitute a Title to the

case, and that of the <hi>Levites,</hi> is too great;
unless he could shew as plain a command for the former,
as he knows can be brought for the latter. The word
<hi>Give</hi> in <hi>Chronicles,</hi> doth no way prejudice the <hi>Levites</hi>
Right, because it was undeniably grounded upon an
indisputable Command: But the word <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

doth greatly prejudice the pretended Right of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedec,</hi>
because there is no command in Scripture, from
which such a Right might be derived. After the same
manner argues the other Priest in his Vindication of the
Conference, pag. 295. urging for an Example the
words of <hi>Ioshua, Chap. 7. Ver. 19. [My Son, give
Glory to God]</hi> which being the same with that of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Psal.</hi> 29. 2. is answered in that. But he seems
to take it a little ill, that I took no notice of a <hi>Greek</hi>
word he had in his Margin, <hi>Conference,</hi> pag. 135. <hi>viz.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I passed it by as believing it to be of no moment at
all; since if I should allow him even his own rendition,
<hi>[He Tythed Abraham]</hi> it imports no more then <hi>[He
received Tythes of Abraham]</hi> as both <hi>Beza's Latine,</hi>
and the vulgar <hi>English</hi> have it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 6. beyond
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65611:21"/>
which sense if he would strain it, the word will not bear
it: verily, it is an Argument of a very weak Cause,
when men are put to such hard shifts, as to squeez a
Title out of one perticular and extraordinary Action,
and are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But blessed be God, the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> hath hedged them
out, and either through propriety of Speech, or divine
Providence (let them grant which they please) hath so
worded this Transaction, that in both those Texts where
it is spoken of, there is no mention at all of Due or Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with relation to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but altogether of
giving. <hi>Thrice over it is said, He gave, Gen. 18. 20.

in some (the <hi>Locrians)</hi> who gave <hi>not a Tenth,</hi> but a
<hi>Ninth</hi> part, C. 3. S. 3. And <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> tells
us, <hi>(l. 2. c.</hi> 2.) <hi>The</hi> Egyptian <hi>Priests had the third
part of the Revenue of the Kingdom.</hi> From all which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65611:22"/>
we may gather that these <hi>Heathenish</hi> Oblations and

Then for the ground of their thus doing, if it be
ask't whence they learnt it, the Priest himself answers,
<hi>It was propagated by Tradtion among the</hi> Heathens,
Right of Tythes, pag. 26. again, <hi>which therefore we must
believe they had by Tradition from the first Patriarchs,</hi>
pag. 27. That they received it by <hi>Tradition</hi> is probable
enough, though not from the first <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> who are
no where in Holy Writ, remembred to have <hi>paid</hi>
Tythes. But from the <hi>Iews,</hi> by whom Tythes were
preceptively and constantly paid, there is reason suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to perswade they might learn it. And so it seem'd
to <hi>Selden, The payment of the Tenth</hi> (sayes he, c. 3.
pag 34.) <hi>very likely came to them</hi> (the <hi>Arabians) from
the use of it among the</hi> Jews, <hi>their Neighbours, as also
to the</hi> Carthaginians <hi>from their Ancesters the</hi> Paenicians,
<hi>that spake the same Language <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in <hi>imitation,</hi> and by <hi>example</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> what relation
has their practice to this <hi>first</hi> Period, or time <hi>before the
Law?</hi> But whether it be more reasonable to think,
that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> received it by Tradition from the first
<hi>Patriarchs,</hi> by whom we never read that Tythes were

<hi>Abraham</hi> have paid Tythes of all his Substance, of all
that he possest. But no such thing appears at all. We
do not read that <hi>Abraham</hi> gave him Tythes of his own
Estate; but that which he gave him the tenth of was the
Spoyls which he had recover'd from the Kings that
had plunder'd <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </q> To this the Author of the
<hi>Right of Tythes</hi> thus answers, p. 30. <hi>That was an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
occasion, wherein</hi> Abraham <hi>having got a Victory
by God's Blessing, did give to God the tenth of all he had
now gotten; as in all probability he was wont ordinarily to
do, of all that he got by God's ordinary Blessing; only this (as

upon an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Occasion was, <hi>to draw an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Conclusion,</hi> that Abraham <hi>ordinarily</hi> did <hi>pay</hi> Tythes,
and that Christians <hi>now</hi> must. Thus then he is pincht off
of his extraordinary hold, by his own dear Sir, the
Author of the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>riendly Conference.</hi> And for what he
talks of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s giving the tenth <hi>ordinarily,</hi> he hath
far less ground then for the former; for in the former,
(viz. that <hi>Abraham</hi> on that <hi>extraordinary</hi> Occasion did
give and <hi>Melchizedec</hi> receive) he may as to <hi>fact</hi> be po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive,
though not as to <hi>intention:</hi> but in the latter;
(viz. that <hi>Abraha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> did <hi>ordinarily</hi> give the tenth of his
<hi>ordinary</hi> increase) he can be but <hi>suppositive</hi> at most. His
Arguments and Reasons are <hi>may-be's</hi> and <hi>likelihoods,</hi> and
his Proofs but <hi>probabilities,</hi> strongly inforced with this
notable <hi>Demonstration,</hi> that <hi>it is not said in Scripture</hi>
Abraham <hi>did not pay them,</hi> and that <hi>I cannot prove the
contrary,</hi> pag. 30, 31. Will he take it then for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that <hi>Abraham</hi> did whatsoever I cannot prove he did
not? That would be pretty indeed.</p>
            <p>After the same manner the other Priest also argues
(in his Vindication, pag. 296.) where to my saying,
<q>Had Tythes been due to <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> then must <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
have paid him Tythes of all his Substance,</q> &amp;c.
He replies, <hi>We know nothing to the contrary but that he
did so; and I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>an affirm the one, as well as he deny the

            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:65611:24"/>
Is this like a Disputant? It is enough for a Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to deny: But is it enough for the Opponent to
affirm? He says else-where in his <hi>Conference,</hi> p. 152.
<hi>It is the Opponent's part to prove.</hi> That is somewhat
more I think then bare affirming. And the Maxime is,
<hi>Affir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>; i. e.</hi> He that affirms must
prove. But (in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> pag. 296.) he adds,
that <hi>The Spoyls were in strictness Abraham</hi>'s own Estate,
having obtained them with the hazard of his Life, in a
Iust and Righteous War.</p>
            <p>This is indeed a <hi>pretty fetch;</hi> yet so plain and manifest
a fetch, that it will not stand him in any stead. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Spoyls were strictly <hi>Abraham</hi>'s own Estate by
the Law of Arms, I will not undertake to determine;
especially since it appears by the story, that <hi>Aner,
Eshcol</hi> and <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ederates, and ran equal
hazard of their Lives with him in the same War, and
that he took not upon him to dispose of the whole
(although to the King of <hi>Sodom,</hi> from whom it was
taken) but l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, 24. However,
whether it was in strictness his own Estate or no, to be
sure it was not his own Estate in that sense wherein I
spake it, and wherein Tythes are now demanded. So
that his urging this here, is altogether beside the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
and at best but a shew of an Answer.</p>
            <p>But he carps at my saying, <q>The Occasion of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
thus giving the tenth of the Spoyl to <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi>
seems to be altogether accidental.</q> This seems to
him to be a meer Trifle; and he says, <hi>(Vindication,</hi>
pag. 197.) <hi>As meer an accidental Passage as the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<hi>would have this to be, yet the</hi> Apostle <hi>draws a solid

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65611:24"/>
from an accidental Passage? Let any one considerately
read the place (in <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.) and see if he can find any
ground to believe either that <hi>Abraham</hi> came thither
with an intention to pay Tythes, or that <hi>Melchizedec</hi>
came thither with an expectation to receive Tythes:
and not rather, that <hi>Melchiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

with my arguing, because it is negative, and says, p.</hi> 31.

            <p>Negative arguing I thought had been proper for him
whose part it is to deny; as it belongs to him to prove,
who undertakes to affirm. But waving that, I thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
answer to the substance of his Objection. Although
the Patriarchs before the Flood did doubtless somthing
else then beget Sons and Daughters, yet nothing that
they did which the Spirit of God thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it to pass by
unrecorded, had any relation to future times, or was
to be Exemplary to the Church of God in after Ages.
The like concerning <hi>Abraham.</hi> 'Tis not to be doubted
but he did more then is recorded of him. But that
then, whatsoever it was, had no relation to future
times, nor was to be Exemplary to the Church of God
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65611:25"/>
in after Ages; for if it had, the Spirit of God, who
recorded what is written, would not have omitted
that. So that take it which way he will, this Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
will attend him; either that <hi>Abraham</hi> did not pay
Tythes ordinarily, and so there was nothing of that to
be recorded, or that if he did pay Tythes ordinarily,
his so doing had no relation to future times, nor was
to be Exemplary to the Church of God in after Ages,
and therefore was not recorded. Hence then, I hope,
my negative arguing (as he calls it) will appear to be
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ufficient force to prove, that a Right to Tythes

               </hi> then <hi>Piety,</hi> for in all those six
Generations between <hi>Enos</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> we find but <hi>one</hi>
man, <hi>Enoch only,</hi> that is said to have walked with God,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 5. and in the 6th and 7th Chapters we read, the
Wickedness of men was grown to that <hi>height,</hi> that
God repented he had made man, and by an universal
Deluge swept all Mankind away, excepting only <hi>Noah</hi>
and his Family, which were in all but Eight Souls. All
which being duly weighed, I leave it to the judicious
Reader's consideration, whether in those times there
was any <hi>settled publick</hi> Worship, wherein any <hi>outward
Priestly Office</hi> or Service was to be performed, for which
Tythes might have been a <hi>Compensation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he argues, that Melchizedeck</hi> did perform God's
publick Worship solemnly and constantly at <hi>Salem;</hi> and
by that had a Right founded in natural Iustice and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to receive Tythes from all within his Iurisdiction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this he infers from Moses'</hi> s calling him the Priest
of the most high God, <hi>from</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s making him a Type
of Christ's Priesthood, <hi>and from</hi> his fixed Residence at
<hi>Salem, p.</hi> 36.</p>
            <p>This has indeed as fair an appearance as any of the
Probabilities he has yet brought forth; yet this will
not do his business. For here is not in all this any men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of any <hi>settled publick Worship,</hi> wherein he could
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65611:26"/>
perform any <hi>outward Priestly Office</hi> or Service, for
which Tythe might have been a <hi>Compensation.</hi> No such
thing is here exprest; and according to the Axiom
which the Priest himself uses (pag. 62) Non express<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

non nocent, <hi>those things that are not exprest, do not hurt.</hi>
Besides, his being called the Priest of the most high
God, doth not necessarily inse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet have no such <hi>outward Priestly Office</hi> or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Service to

himself, describing <hi>Mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hizedco</hi>'s Worship,
doth sufficiently shew it was of another kind then what
my words had relation to. For he says, pag. 39. <hi>His
Worship was altogether spiritual, praising God, praying
for</hi> Abraham; <hi>offering no bloody Sacrifices, but</hi> ONLY
<hi>bringing forth Bread and Wine.</hi> So also says <hi>Sparrow</hi> in
his <hi>Rationale</hi> of the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> pag. 338, 339.
Melchizedec <hi>had no other Offering that we read of, but
Bread and Wine.</hi> Whereas it is plain my words aimed
at such a <hi>settled publick</hi> Worship as co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sisted in <hi>external
services.</hi> But sure he doth not think that <hi>Melchizedec</hi>
did pray for <hi>Abraham</hi> and bring out Bread and Wine
constantly at <hi>Salem:</hi> For that he ever did either the
one or other constantly, or any more then that one
time, is NOT EXPREST, not likely.</p>
            <p>Then for his having a <hi>fixed place of Residence at</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
which is another part of my Opponent's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
upon which he grounds his Question, <hi>What is a
Priest fixed in a City for?</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:65611:27"/>
It is to be considered, that his <hi>Residence</hi> at <hi>Salim</hi> is
not mention'd with relation to his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> but to
his <hi>Kingship;</hi> he was <hi>King of Salem,</hi> that was Reason
enough for his Residence there. So <hi>Moses</hi> calls him,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 14. 18. And so the Apostle twice together, <hi>Heb.</hi>
7. 1, 2. But neither of them called him <hi>Priest of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
much less affirmed (as my Opponent does) that
he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being the Priest of the most high God, will
needs have him to be <hi>Abrahams Priest in ordinary too,</hi>
pag. 33, 34 Not considering perhaps, that himself had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>nary;
and yet he placed them as near together as he could too.
For though he sayes St. <hi>Ierom</hi> compu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>es the plain of
<hi>Mamre,</hi> which is <hi>Hebron,</hi> where <hi>Abraham</hi> dwelt, to
be but twenty two Miles distant from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> yet
he should not be ignorant of the different Judgments
of the Antients about the place; some taking <hi>Salem</hi> to
be <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> others not. And that <hi>Hierom</hi> there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
the Opinion of others, not his own, which was
far otherwise, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Salem</hi> and <hi>Mamre</hi> were about
eighty Miles asunder, as <hi>Selden</hi> notes in the Review of
the first Chapter of his History of Tythes, pag. 452.
Yet to countenance this conceit of his, that <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi>
was <hi>Abraham's</hi> Priest in Ordinary; he tells us what

did vow a Vow, saying, <hi>If God will be with me, and will
keep me in this way that I go, and will give me Bread to
eat, and Rayment to put on; so that I come again to my
Father's House in peace: then shall the Lord be my God.
And this Stone which I have set for a Pillar, shall be
Gods House: And of all that thou shalt give me, I will
surely give the Tenth unto thee, Gen.</hi> 28. This is the
Vow, and this the occasion of making it; which was
both <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>conditional, Voluntary,</hi> in being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>required;
<hi>Conditional,</hi> in depending on the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of Gods promise to him, as the conditional Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
[If] demonstrates. Had Tythes been then a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Tribute,</hi> he needed not have <hi>vowed</hi> to <hi>Give</hi> them;
justice would have <hi>obliged</hi> him to have <hi>paid</hi> them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had Vow'd or no. Nor had it then been in his
Power to have made his Obligation <hi>conditional</hi> (as he
did) but Tythes he must have paid, whether God had

him back in peace, or no. This Vow of <hi>Iacob's</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
being <hi>spontaneous</hi> and altogether <hi>free,</hi> Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
nothing at all to the making up of a divine Right
to Tythes.</p>
            <p>§. 13. <hi>Another passage in my Book that seems to
gall him sore, is this,</hi> If Tythes had been due to <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedec,</hi>
yet could not the Clergy of this Age derive any
Right from him to them, in as much as they are not of his
Priest-hood: <hi>To this he sayes,</hi> I hope <hi>T. E.</hi> will grant,
that Christ was of his Priest-hood. And if he grant this,
we must ask, whether or no his Apostles were not his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors?
and then, whether we do not derive our Succession
from them? <hi>pag.</hi> 39.</p>
            <p>That Christ was of his Priest-hood I grant, and that
his Apostles were Followers of him: But that these
Priests are Followers of the Apostles, as the Apostles
were of Christ, I deny; and think it would be worth
their while to prove. He sayes, Melchizede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In some respects it may be called the same; but whats

<hi>He can produce</hi> (he sayes, pag. 40) <hi>the plain words
of many Fathers, affirming, that the present Ministers of

            </p>

Ministers I pray must the Word <hi>Present</hi> here be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
to relate to, the <hi>then present,</hi> or the <hi>now present?</hi>
If he intends the <hi>then present</hi> Ministers, that lived in
the several Ages of those Fathers (as he calls them) he
plainly shuffles and evades; for the question was not

is not Reasoning, pag. 12.) hath upon this occasion,
for want of better Arguments, (or breeding, or both)
thrust in to help swell the number of his pages. But
overlooking this, let us see what else he has to offer
that looks at all like Reason. He sayes, pag.</hi> 41. The
Apostle speaking of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Priests in that place <hi>(Heb.
7. 16.)</hi> saith, They were made Priests after the Law of
a carnal Commandment, <hi>that is,</hi> according to <hi>Moses's</hi>
Law, which consisted of outward and weak Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
reaching only to the purifying of the Flesh. Now
<hi>(sayes he)</hi> what an idle and impertinent Man is this, to
say, we are made Priests according to <hi>Moses's</hi> Law, and
that every one knows this! O impudent Slander! Are we
bound to all the Sacrificings, Washings, and other <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
Rights and Ceremonies, at our Ordination?</p>
            <p>I will not here (as justly I might) retort his <hi>Idle</hi> and
<hi>impertinent</hi> Epithets, nor yet his <hi>impudent Slander</hi>
But I will tell him, he seems very willing to mistake,
that he might excuse himself from a direct Answer.
He charges me with saying, <hi>They are made Priests ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65611:31"/>
to</hi> Moses'<hi>s Law.</hi> I no wheresay so, no where
intend so: for indeed, I do not think their Ordination
so fairly grounded; since all acknowledge the Law of
<hi>Moses,</hi> though now abrogated, to <hi>have had</hi> a Divine
Institution. I said, These men are made Priests after
the Law of a Carnal Commandment. Doth that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
imply <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law? May no Law, no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
be called carnal, but that which did bind to
Sacrificings, Washings, and other <hi>Levitical</hi> Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies?
That's strange indeed! Nay, may not every
Law, every Commandment, which is not spiritual, be
properly enough called Carnal, as Carnal is understood
in opposition to Spiritual? What though I used the
Apostle's Phrase? must that Allusion tye my sense to
the subject he was upon? No such matter. He oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

shewing that these are not of his Order (though for
Tythes sake they pretend it) in as much as <hi>he</hi> was made
a Priest not after the Law of a Carnal Commandment,
but after the Power of an Endless Life; whereas <hi>these</hi>
men are made Priests after the Law of a Carnal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment:
but it does not follow that this must
needs be the same Law by which the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priests
were made, unless he thinks there can be no others.
By what Law then are the <hi>Popish</hi> Priests made (out of
which this Priesthood sprang?) By what Law are the
<hi>Turkish</hi> Priests made? I hope he will not say either of
these are made Priests by the Power of an Endless Life
(as was <hi>Melchizedec)</hi> nor yet by the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi>
&amp; yet by some Law or other no doubt they were made:
What will he call that Law, Spiritual or Carnal? Let
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:65611:31"/>
him call it as he pleases: I insist not so much on the
Names, as on the Natures of things, nor regard so
much Words as Matter. Notwithstanding what he
hath said the Difference yet remains, the Opposition is
still as plain between <hi>Melchizedec</hi> and these Priests;
<hi>He</hi> was made a Priest, not after the Law of a Carnal
Commandment, but after the Power of an Endless
Life: <hi>These</hi> are made Priests, not after the Power of
an Endless Life, but after the Law of a Carnal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment;
which plainly shews they are not of his
Order, and so cannot derive any Right to Tythes from
him, if Tythes could be proved to have ever been due
to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He goes on, ibid.</hi> 'Tis evident we are not Priests ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Carnal, Outward, Changeable, <hi>Levitical</hi>

            <p>Neither did I say ye were: But are ye not Priests
according to a <hi>carnal</hi> Law, an <hi>outward</hi> Law, a <hi>change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>

Law?</p>

the Gospel, whose Eternal Duties have in them the Power
of an Endless Life.</p>
            <p>What a quaint Device is this to avoid the force of a
Text! Was not the Scripture-Phrase plain &amp; pertinent
enough? or did it not suit his purpose? Were he indeed
a Priest after <hi>Melchizedec</hi>'s Order, he need not have
used this <hi>variation.</hi> Had he been made a Priest by the
<hi>same Power</hi> of an Endless Life, by which <hi>Melchizedec</hi>
was, the <hi>same words</hi> would have very well served to

whereas my words (agreeing with the Text) are, He
was made a Priest after the <hi>Power</hi> of an Endless Life,
pag. 281. This <hi>Power of an Endless Life</hi> is a heavy
Stone to all these carnal <hi>man-made</hi> Priests; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they struggle to get from under the weight of it,
and endeavour to put it from them, as we see in this
Priest, who thrusts this Power from himself, and places
it in the Duties. He durst not say the <hi>Power</hi> of an End<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

<hi>Power</hi> then shall he Perform the Duty? How vast a

does) but he declar'd he receiv'd the Gospel it self, and
his Apostleship or Ministry therein, <hi>by the Revel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

so neither must our Priesthood, but, like that of <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedec,</hi>
shall endure forever.</p>
            <p>The Law of the Gospel is indeed <hi>unchangeable,</hi> and
so is <hi>Melchizedec</hi>'s Priesthood; but the <hi>changeableness</hi>
of these Priests and their Priesthood is an evident token
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65611:32"/>
that they are <hi>not</hi> Priests of his Order, nor made accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>unchangeable</hi> Law of the Gospel. How many
<hi>Turns</hi> and <hi>Changes</hi> has here been amongst them within
little more then the last Century! One while a <hi>Popish</hi>
Priesthood, another while a <hi>Protestant,</hi> then <hi>Popish</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,

and now an <hi>Episcopal</hi> again. Is this the <hi>unchangeable</hi>
Priesthood he talks of, that, like <hi>Melchizedec</hi>'s, shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
forever! Methinks the remembrance of former
times should convince him of his Weakness. If this
man himself was not then a Changer, and trudg'd with
his <hi>Lamp</hi> that way which he saw the <hi>Oyl</hi> was likely to
run (which the concealing his Name gives cause to
suspect) I would ask him, where he, and the Priests
whose Cause he advocates, were <hi>blessing and bringing
forth their bread and their Wine</hi> between twenty and
thirty years ago, when a Common-Prayer Priest was
rare to be seen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He goes on thus,</hi> And as we bear the same Office with
him <hi>(Melchizedec)</hi> and do the like Work, we deserve
the same Reward, and may expect Tythes as well as he,
<hi>pag.</hi> 42.</p>
            <p>I do not find he ever expected any. However, since
these Priests pretend to bear the same Office with
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elchizedec,</hi> it will not be amiss to observe what they
themselves make his Office to be. This Priest says, p.
39. <hi>His Worship was altogether spiritual, praising God,
praying for</hi> Abraham, <hi>only bringing forth Bread and
Wine. Sparrow</hi> Bishop of <hi>Exon,</hi> in his <hi>Rationale</hi> of
the Common-Prayer, says much-what the same, Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedec
<hi>had no other Offering,</hi> that we read of, <hi>but
Bread and Wine,</hi> p. 339.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:65611:33"/>
Now if this was the Office of <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> and
these Priests pretend to bear the same Office with him,
how comes it to pass that they have so much other
Work to do, as <hi>Marrying, Burying, Sprinkling,
Churching of Women,</hi> and much more, which it doth
not appear <hi>Melchizedec</hi> did at all concern himself with?
Surely, either their Office is <hi>larger</hi> then <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedec</hi>'s
and so not the same with his; or else, <hi>they
go beyond their Office,</hi> when they intermeddle with
these matters.</p>
            <p>But however, he says, <hi>They do the like Work as</hi>
Melchizedec <hi>did.</hi> His Work was to bring forth Bread
and Wine, which he did <hi>frcely</hi> like a King, <hi>not putting</hi>
Abraham <hi>to the Charge to pay for it.</hi> But these bring
forth <hi>neither</hi> Bread <hi>nor</hi> Wine, but <hi>put the people to the
Charge to buy them;</hi> and if any be left, though <hi>the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
pay</hi> for it, yet the <hi>Priests</hi> will be sure to <hi>have it.</hi> And
<hi>He</hi> not only presented <hi>Abraham</hi> with Bread and Wine,

            <p>Here I must crave the Reader leave to make a
short digression, to remove a Cavil urged by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the Conference, the occasion whereof was
thus; At his entrance upon the discourse of Tythes,
in his Conference, pag. 131. he mentioned a Book
of <hi>Edward Burrough's,</hi> called, <hi>A just and righteous
Plea,</hi> &amp;c. Out of which he collected a Quotation
in these words, pag. 132. <hi>Tythes are now not to be
paid according to the first Covenant, neither is the first
Priest-hood to be upheld that once gave and received
Tythes; Now should we pay Tythes according to the
first Covenant, and uphold any part of that Priest-hood,
which took Tythes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then should we deny Iesus
Christ to be come in the Flesh.</hi> Hereupon, he took
occasion to quarrel about the Priest-hood, ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taxing <hi>E. B.</hi> with ignorance in the Nature of the
first Priest-hood, and alledging that <hi>If by the first
Priest-hood he meant that of</hi> Aaron, <hi>then he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented

in his Vindication, pag. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the first Priest-hood with respect to that Priest-hood
that succeeded it, which is the Gospel ministry.
In which sense it is both generally understood &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called the first Priest-hood. And as well might
the Priest blame the Apostle for calling that Covenant
which was made with the <hi>Iews,</hi> the first Covenant
(which he doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> then once in his Epistle to the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65611:35"/>
               <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 8. 7. and 9. 1.) as find fault with
<hi>E. B.</hi> for call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ng the <hi>Iewish</hi> Priest-hood the first
Priest-hood. There needs not much be said in this
case, to shew the emptiness of this Cavil, which of
it self is obvious to every Eye. But he takes notice
that E. B. was an occasion of my Convincement; and
thence himself takes fresh occasion to raise his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
at my not answering this passage before. He
may for that reason the rather believe, that I did not
esteem it worthy of an Answer, since if I had, he may
reasonably conclude I would not have been backward
to vindicate one to whom I was so greatly obliged.
It is very true indeed, that the Lord made E. B. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
to the turning me from the Darkness
(wherein I once sate under the teaching of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal
Ministry) unto the true Light of Christ Jesus;
which with joy of Heart, and a thankful mind, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
and my Soul blesses the Lord in the sense
of his mercy extended to me therein. And of that
faithful Servant of God (whom the Priest in derision
calls m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Patriarch) this certain Testimony I have to
bear, That he was endued with Power from on high,
and the Spirit of the Almighty rested on him; of which
amongst many thousands I am a witness. But to
proceed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the same place, Vindication, pag. 295. the
Priest charges me with</hi> cunningly passing over his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and skipping four pages at the entrance of his
discourse of Tythes.</p>
            <p>This Accusation is utterly false, as will appear by
comparing my Book with his. He began with
Tythes in his Conference at the bottom of pag. 131.
He spent pag. 132. in quibling about the first Priest-hood.
Then in pag. 133. having disowned all Titles
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65611:36"/>
to Tythes by vertue of the Ceremonial Law, he
started a Question, Whether Tythes are not purely
Ceremonial, &amp;c. which he answered in the Negative,
and withal shewed how far he understood them to be
Ceremonial: To all this I answered in my former
Book, called <hi>Truth prevailing,</hi> bestowing two pages
thereon, pag. 282, 283. Then in pag. 134. of his
Conference he drew a comparison between the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priest-hood, and the present
Clergy: To which I answered in pag. 348, 349, and
350. of my said Book. Judge now Reader whether
was skipping over four pages, and passing by his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
But of this let this suffice. I now return
to the former Subject, from which the unfair dealing
of my disingenuous Adversary hath occasioned this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</p>
            <p>§. 1. That which is chiefly to be inquired in, our

the Law, is, 1. Whether Tythes were a part of
the Ceremonial Law, 2. Whether they were abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
by Christ. The Priest begins with the last of
these, and offers to prove, after his manner, that
Tythes were not abrogated by Christ, <hi>Let not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christ was not less careful of his Ministers under the
Gospel, then God had been of his Priests under the
Law, which I hope it will be granted he might very
well be, though he did not appoint them the self-same
Maintenance. And indeed, when this Priest sayes, pag.
47. <hi>These words</hi> [Even so] <hi>do manifest, that Christ
hath in the main, and for the essential part, made like
Provision for Gospel Ministers, as God the Father did
for the</hi> Jewish <hi>Priesthood;</hi> he is not much beside the

part, which is simply a <hi>maintenance,</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to the <hi>mode</hi> or <hi>way,</hi> by which it should be
raised.</p>
            <p>Again, he sayes, <hi>This was also a Pattern for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout</hi>
Christians <hi>of Old, and did intimate to them, that
they should not do less for their Ministers then would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford

doubted the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, in the Ages succeeding
that of the Apostles, was but <hi>too much</hi> imitated by
the <hi>Christians.</hi> He that reads the Writings of those
Times, and observes the <hi>bulk</hi> of <hi>Iewish</hi> Ceremonies,
that have gradually crept into the publick Worship
of Professed <hi>Christians<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> will find no cause to question
it. And though the <hi>Christians</hi> in those times were
<hi>very commendable</hi> for providing honourably for Christs
Ministers; yet in recurring to the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law,
then abrogated, and fetching Examples from thence,
they did <hi>not deserve commendation.</hi> Nor is there any
need for <hi>Christians</hi> now to look back to the <hi>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it with <hi>Lydia,</hi> the Thyatiress, when her heart was

16. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>These men peradventure may think such a Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
not <hi>honourable</hi> enough. But they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
that it was <hi>honourable enough</hi> for the holy
Apostles, and for our Saviour himself also, who
though he were Lord of all, yet did not disdain to be
thus provided for, but by his own Example laid the
Foundation of this Gospel Maintenance, as we read
in <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 2, 3. where <hi>Mary Magdalen, I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>anna</hi> the
Wife of <hi>Chuza, Herod's</hi> Steward, and <hi>Susanna,</hi> and
many others are remembred to have ministred to
him of their Substance. Was this accepted by the
Master, and will it not content them who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
his Servants? They had need then be put in
mind, that <hi>the Disciple is not above his Master, nor
the Servant above his Lord.</hi> And that, <hi>It is enough
for the Disciple that he is as his Master, and the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
as his Lord, Matth.</hi> 8. 24, 25. And were these
men indeed what they pretend to be, they would
not think <hi>slightly</hi> of that Maintenance, which our
blessed Saviour was contented with. But verily, their
<hi>despising</hi> and rejecting this, and <hi>creeping</hi> to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
for another, is Argument enough that for all
their pretences, they are not the Servants of humble
Jesus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:65611:40"/>§. 5. <hi>To shew that the</hi> Levitical <hi>Law for Tythes
was a pattern for the</hi> Christians <hi>of old, he gives us a
quotation out of</hi> Origen, <hi>thus,</hi> Our Lord saith in the
Gospel (speaking of tything Mint, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> These things
ought ye to have done. If you reply, He said this to
the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> not to his Disciples; then hear what be
saith to his Disciples, Except your Righteousness exceed
the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees ye shall
not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.
Therefore that which he would have done by the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,
more abundantly would he have it done by his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples.
—Now how doth my Righteousness exceed that
of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> if they durst not taste of the Fruits of
the Earth, before they had separated the <hi>Priests</hi> and
<hi>Levites</hi> parts; and I devour the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ruits of the Earth,
so that the Priest knows not of it, the <hi>Levite</hi> is a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to it, and God's Altar receives nothing. Herein
<hi>(sayes the Priest)</hi> Origen speaks my sense fully, <hi>pag.</hi>
47.</p>
            <p>By this then we know <hi>fully</hi> what the Priests sense is
in this case; let us see now how <hi>much,</hi> or rather how
<hi>little,</hi> this sense of his agrees with Truth. When
Christ said to the <hi>Pharisees</hi> (concerning tything Mint,
&amp;c.) <hi>These things ye ought to have done,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Law,</hi> by
which Tythes were commanded to be paid, <hi>was in
force,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Pharisees</hi> in observing the
Law, did but what they ought to do. But though
they were in that part so observant of the Law, yet
in other parts, more material, they were wholly
negligent. Now as that caution of our Saviour to
his Disciples, <hi>Except your Righteousness exceed the
Righteousness of the</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi> Pharisees, &amp;c. was
not given with particular relation to the <hi>Pharisees</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65611:41"/>
punctuality in tything Mint, &amp;c. being spoken long
before, and upon another occasion; so neither can it
with any colour of reason be supposed, that the
excess or superabounding of the Disciples Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
above and beyond the Righteousness of the
<hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> was to consist in a more exact
observance of the Ceremonies of the Law, which
were then even expiring, and the Disciples daily fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for the manifestation of <hi>a more glorious</hi> and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Administration. But the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
who were so exact in those <hi>smaller</hi> and <hi>lighter</hi> matters
of tything Mint, &amp;c. did break <hi>great</hi> and <hi>weighty</hi>
Commands of God, and taught men so, as appears
in <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 6. where Christ tells them, <hi>You have
mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the command of God</hi> (for honouring of Parents)
<hi>of no effect by your Tradition;</hi> and in <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 13.
(where the same passage is recorded) He adds, <hi>And
many such like things do ye,</hi> of which there is a large
Bed-roll in the 23d of <hi>Matthew.</hi> For these <hi>Pharisai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Tythers did <hi>shut the Kingdom of Heaven against
men, neither entring themselves, nor suffering others,
They devoured Widows Houses, were full of extortion,</hi>
and while they were so exact in tything the very <hi>Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbs,</hi>
they omitted the <hi>weightier matters</hi> of the Law,
<hi>Iudgment, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Faith.</hi> Now while the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> stood in a <hi>nice</hi> and exact per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of those <hi>lesser</hi> matters: the Disciples Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
was to shine forth in the performance of
those <hi>weightier</hi> matters, Judgment, Mercy, Faith,
&amp;c. wherein as they were exercised, their Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
would as really exceed the Righteousness of
the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> as the things themselves in which they
were conversant <hi>(viz.</hi> Judgment, Mercy, Faith,
&amp;c.) did excel those things which the <hi>Pharisees</hi> were
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65611:41"/>
busied about, (to wit, tything of Mint and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ise)
And how great a preheminence and preference the
one sort has of the other, may sufficiently appear in
the Vers. 23. where Judgment, Mercy and Faith
are comparatively to Tythes, called the <hi>weig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

matters. But the <hi>disproportion</hi> is more clearly set
forth in the next Vers. where <hi>Tythes</hi> are compared to
the <hi>Gnat</hi> (one of the <hi>least</hi> of Insects) but <hi>Iudgment,
Mercy</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> to the <hi>Camel</hi> (one of the <hi>greatest</hi>
of Animals) which Metaphors, drawn from the two
Extreams, do evidently enough denote the <hi>different
Natures</hi> of the things there handled; one sort of
which <hi>(viz.</hi> Judgment, Mercy, &amp;c.) is plainly
<hi>Moral,</hi> the other <hi>(viz.</hi> tything of Mint, &amp;c.) as
clearly <hi>Ceremonial.</hi> Now to su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to be Literally observed, and what not;</hi> the same may
well be said of his Writings, There is need of great
caution and sound judgment in quoting what he has
written. For though he was a Man of great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
yet was he too apt to run the wrong way, for
which he has been not lightly censured by many. And
indeed, his aptness to allegorize the Scriptures,
makes it seem the more strange that he should take
this place literally; and yet he hath even here exprest
himself so darkly too, that it would puzzle I think
a wise Citator to find out who that <hi>Levite</hi> is, to whom
under the Gospel, Tythes should be paid according
to the Letter of the Law.</p>
            <p>But leaving the Priest to untye that Knot, I here
present thee Reader with the judgment of <hi>Walter
Brute</hi> upon this Text, whom though I know before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
the Priest despises and disdains (reproachfully
calling him <hi>Renegad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Right of Tythes,</hi> pag. 139.)
because he strikes at their <hi>Diana</hi> Tythes; yet I make
no doubt but amongst honest men, he will at least he
never the worse, if not the better thought of. He
having shewed that Tythes were Ceremonial, and
the Law abrogated by which they were due to the
<hi>Levites,</hi> goes on to disprove the pretences of those
who claim a Right from those words of Christ to the
<hi>Pharisees.</hi> His words are these, <q>Whereupon some
do say, that by the Gospel we are bound to pay
Tythes, because Christ said to the <hi>

undone. O ye blind Guides that strain at a Gnat
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65611:42"/>
and swallow up a Camel. This word soundeth not
as a Commandment or manner of bidding, whereby
Christ did command Tythes to be given; but it is a
word of disallowing the Hypocrisie of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi>
who of Covetousness did rather weigh and esteem
Tythes, because of their own singula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

rather then other great and weighty Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

it, <q>We must consider in what time our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ to spake unto the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> for as yet
neither the Law, nor the Ceremonies thereof were
fully abrogated: Christ was Circumcised, and
<hi>Mary</hi> his Mother purified according to the Law,

to shew himself to the Priest, and offer a gift as
<hi>Moses</hi> commanded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 4. Yet none of all
these Ceremonies now stand in force, though Christ
did them at that time, and bad them to be done.
The same Answer may serve also concerning his
Injuction to the <hi>Pharisees</hi> as touching their Tythes.</q>
Thus he, by which it is past doubt that, although he
was a zealous Advocate for Tythes as a Maintenance,
yet he acounted them not Moral, but Ceremonial.</p>
            <p>§. 6. <hi>The Priest hath yet another document from
the</hi> Levitical <hi>Law, namely, That</hi> the substance of that
which was required then, is due still not by vertue of
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aw, but because there is an inkerent equity in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Substance is a Maintenance in which there is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65611:43"/>
an inherent equity, that the Labourers should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded,
but that this Maintenance should be by
Tythes, was not the Substance in which the inherent
equity stood, but a Circumstance, <hi>Ceremony</hi> or Mode,
due only by vertue of that Law while it stood, and
no longer. For though it be equal that the Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
should be rewarded for his labour, yet the <hi>equality</hi>
of the reward stands not in Tythes, or a tenth part,
which may either <hi>exceed</hi> or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in the Law, is due still,</hi> he sayes, pag. 48. <hi>Is</hi>
Origen's <hi>meaning in the af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sayes) <hi>we must interpret St.</hi> Hierom, <hi>when he saith,
That which we have said of Tythes and first Fruits
which were once given by the People to the</hi> Priests <hi>and</hi>
Levites, <hi>you must understand also of the</hi> Christian
<hi>People, to whom it is commanded not only to give Tythes
but to sell all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But where is there a command <hi>to Christians,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to <hi>give Tythes,</hi> or to <hi>sell all? Hierom</hi> prest
it from <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. which had direct reference to the
<hi>Iews,</hi> and cannot possibly be made a Command to
<hi>Christians.</hi> And for <hi>Christians</hi> selling all, there is
mention indeed in holy Writ of some that did so, but
not that they were commanded so to do; that was
<hi>voluntary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Priest explains</hi> Hierom's <hi>meaning, that is
(sayes he pag. 49)</hi> so much of the command as was
Moral, so much as was grounded upon eternal Reason,
ought to stand.</p>
            <p>That is not specifically <hi>Tythes,</hi> but a <hi>Maintenance</hi>
in general. It is the Maintenance that is Moral, and
grounded upon eternal Reason; but no man me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks

tyed God who is Lord of all the World, to the

to honour God as the Eternal Lord of the
World, would make him in reallity Lord but of a
Tenth Part of it. That they make his Portion,
which he must take or none. And if they might be
believed, all should depend upon this Tenth; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Tythes no Maintenance, without Maintenance
no Ministers, without Ministers no Worship. This
I'm sure is not Gospel Language. But this is like
his former comparison of the <hi>Oyle</hi> and the <hi>Lamp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whatever this Priest talks of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Eternal Reason (to beget a reverance in Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

we may see that Tythes were not reputed of Divine
Right by the Eternal moral Law, if we consider the

Alienations that have been made of them to common
uses in <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. time. And though the Priest may

Logick, as would make a serious man smile.</hi> When
the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood failed <hi>(sayes he, pag. 49)</hi> there

            <p>What a pretty pair of Non-sequiters is here. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there must be another and a better Priesthood,
when the <hi>Levitical</hi> failed, doth it therefore follow,
these must needs be they! upon which of the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
I wonder doth this conclusion lean? that there
must be another Priesthood, or that it must be a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
If it rest on the former, that there must be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Priesthood, that no doubt there may be, and
yet not be these: if on the <hi>latter,</hi> that it must be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
then past all doubt it cannot be these, since
these are so far from being better, that they are not a
little worse. But if upon the failure of the <hi>Levitical</hi>
Priest-hood, there must be another, a better, and
it were possibly to suppose these to be that, doth it
thence follow that these may claim Tythes? What
empty arguing is this! Right Reason would rather
have inferred, that if indeed the <hi>old Priest-hood</hi> had
stood, the <hi>old Maintenance</hi> by Tythes might also
have continued; but the <hi>old Priest-hood</hi> being <hi>ended</hi>
the <hi>old Maintenance</hi> by Tythes is ended also. And as
there was to be <hi>another</hi> Priest-hood <hi>(wholly</hi> another,

not the same a little variated) which should excel
the old Maintenance, as this other Priest-hood
was to be a better Priest-hood then the former, and
that in the same Notion of meliority. This I am sure

            <p>§. 8. <hi>And now (sayes the Priest to his Brother)</hi> I

[That Tythes are not purely Ceremonial] is made good
also; since I have shewed they were grounded on the

            <p>If this <hi>Faith</hi> hath no better Foundation then his
<hi>hope,</hi> the man is in an ill case; for I assure him, I am
so far from being brought to confess he hath made
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65611:46"/>
good the second Position also, that I declare, I a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
fully satisfied he hath made good neither first nor se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
yet. And though he enumerates many and great
matters which he pretends he has shewed, yet, unless
he means, that <hi>saying</hi> is shewing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he hath not shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any one particular of those many which he speaks
of. He sayes, he has shewed that <hi>Tythes were ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the Law of Nature and Primitive Revelation:</hi>
but he has no otherwise shewed it then by saying so.
In pag. 21. he begins with it, and sayes, <hi>Gods right
to Tythes is founded primarily upon the</hi> Law <hi>of</hi> Nature,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and four or five Lines lower he adds, <hi>Natural
Reason teacheth us to give God some part of his gifts
back again, &amp;c.</hi> Then in the same page he concludes,
<hi>Some part of our Substance being therefore due to God,</hi>
&amp;c. So that at first he <hi>begs the Question,</hi> and on
that <hi>precarius</hi> bottom sets his Building. He takes
for granted that which is denyed, and then cryes
out he has shewed: and so indeed he has the <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
of his Cause or his own <hi>inability</hi> to manage it.
If to find Gods Right he would look into the Law of
Nature, he shall there find that God has a right to
<hi>all,</hi> and to <hi>all alike.</hi> He is the God of Nature, the
Universal Power, by which all things were made, and
by which all things subsist. An equal Right he has,
by the Law of Nature, to all that his hands have made,
or ever was brought forth by his productive FIAT.
But nothing can constitute to him a <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
Right to a <hi>tenth,</hi> or any other part, so as to make
that part <hi>(per excellentiam)</hi> more <hi>peculiarly</hi> and <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently</hi>
his then the rest, but his own <hi>appropriation</hi>

            </p>

Scriptures? He should then have done well to have
given us the Text. But if it be not recorded there,
<hi>Why makes he himself so over-wise?</hi> Eccles. 7. 16. And
yet, if he could prove, or I should grant, that
Tythes had been Commanded to be pai'd before
<hi>Moses</hi>'s time, yet would not that prove Tythes any

he sayes, <hi>Though God have a right to the tenth part

from the Light of Nature, that part of our Substance
is due to God:</hi> and this he repeats frequently. But
what Nature is it he talks so much of, by the Light
and Reason whereof he has learnt to make Man's part
<hi>nine times as big</hi> as GODS, and yet sayes, God is
Eternally Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of the World? Surely it is a Corrupt
and <hi>selfish</hi> Nature, whose counterfeit Light gives him
so false a sight of things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He hath shewed, he sayes,</hi> That Tythes rely on an
Internal Rectitude in the thing it self, and an Eternal
Reason of it.</p>
            <p>How can that be? He plunges himself into these
<hi>absurdities</hi> by not distinguishing between Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
in general, and Tythes which are but a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>mode</hi> or way of raising Maintenance, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
which, he thus confounds his own sence. If
he were pleading for a Maintenance in general, his
argument there were good and pertinent: for there
is no doubt, an Internal Rectitude in the thing it
self, that he that Labours should be rewarded for his
Labour, and an Eternal Reason of it from the equity
of the thing. But to suppose an Eternal Reason that
the tenth part only and no other must be this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
is utterly repugnant to all Reason and equity,
since possibly the <hi>fifth</hi> part may be too <hi>small,</hi> or the
<hi>fifteenth</hi> too <hi>great</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> compensation for the work. In
the time of the Law by which Tythes were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
though there was an Internal Rectitude for
a Maintenance, and an Eternal Reason of it; yet
the providing and raising that Maintenance by the
way of Tythes, did not rely on an <hi>Internal Rectitude,</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:65611:47"/>
but on an EXTERNAL: no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was there then an <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Reason for raising the Maintenance by that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
way of Tythes, but a <hi>temporal,</hi> suitable t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the Polity of that State. The Ox that trod out the
Corn was not to be muzzled, but for the Labour and
Service he did he was to be fed; and this depended
on an <hi>Internal</hi> Rectitude in the thing it self: but
he that should thence in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er, that the <hi>certain quantity</hi>
of Meal which should be given to the Ox, or the
<hi>Specifick</hi> kinds of Food he should eat, did rely also
on an <hi>Internal</hi> Rectitude in the things themselves,
would hereby sufficiently convince the World, that
he himself had but too much need to have his own
Understanding <hi>rectified.</hi> From what has been said,
the Reader I presume may collect, that my Opponent
hath much mistaken the matter, in making Tythes,
(which is not the Substance, the Maintenance it self<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
but a Circumstance of the quantity of Maintenance)
to rely on an Internal Rectitude in the thing it self,
and an Eternal Reason of it.</p>
            <p>He adds, that he has shewed <hi>Tythes were paid by
those</hi> Patriarchs <hi>who lived long before the Ceremonial
Law, by Virtue of the Preceding Declarations of the
Divine Right unto them.</hi> Indeed the man is much to be
blamed. He seems to have abandoned all Regard to
Truth and Modesty, and to be resolved <hi>to say anything</hi>
that may suit his purpose. Where hath he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hewed
that the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the Ceremonial Law did
<hi>pay</hi> Tythes? Or how indeed is it possible he should
shew this? when as before that Law, Tythes are

place expresly said to be <hi>given,</hi> without any word of
<hi>payment.</hi> But that he should not only say they <hi>paid</hi>

<hi>pay Tythes,</hi> and to <hi>offer</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as to observe

then neither are they bound to keep that Feast

Ceremonial. This I take to be the fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> sense of
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> his Argument; which plainly shews, both
that <hi>Tythes were not paid in his time</hi> (which was about
the Year 380.) and also that he esteemed Tythes to be
of <hi>the same Nature</hi> with Circumcision and <hi>Iewish</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
to have had their dependence on <hi>the same
Law,</hi> and to have stood and <hi>fallen together:</hi> for he
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:65611:50"/>
compares Tythes to Circumcision and <hi>Iewish</hi> Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which are undoubtedly abrogated. And thus
<hi>Selden</hi> understood him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> on <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. calls Tythes expresly
<hi>Ceremonial.</hi> His words are, <q>Priests, that is <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>

of good things So they shall be free in their
minds; nevertheless to them that serve at the Altar,
it is given to live of the Altar, and they may eat of
the Sacrifices, receive first Fruits, receive Tythes.
<hi>These things are Ceremonial;</hi> but. <hi>Paul</hi> shews there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
that it is lawful to receive <hi>Food and Rayment,</hi>
for God addeth a Blessing to his Ministers that do

               <hi>Walter Brute</hi> (who, in the Reign of K. <hi>Richard</hi>
the second, about the Year 1400. was Persecuted
for his Testimony against <hi>Popery)</hi> plainly calls the
payment of Tythes a <hi>Ceremony.</hi> His words (speaking
of the ceasing of Shadows and Ceremonies, and of
the ending of the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Priest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hood) are these,
<q>Whereupon I marvel that your learned men do say,
that <hi>Christian</hi> Folk are bound to this <hi>small Ceremony</hi>
of the payment of Tythes, and care nothing at all
for other as well the great as the small Ceremonies
of the Law.</q> And a little after (having shewed
that Circumcision was one of the greater <hi>Ceremonies</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:65611:50"/>
of the Law, and yet that <hi>Paul</hi> told the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
Whosoever was Circumcised was bound to keep the

bound to keep all the whole Law.</hi> For to say that
men are bound to <hi>one Ceremony</hi> of the Law, and not
to others, is no reasonable thing. Either there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are bound to them all, or to none. Also,
that by the same old Law, <hi>men are not bound to pay
Tythes,</hi> it may be shewed by many Reasons, which
we need not any more to multiply and increase, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the things that be said are sufficient.</q> For he had
said a pretty deal before upon this Subject, shewing
the end both of that Priest-hood to whom, and of
that service for which Tythes were appointed. <q>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
(sayes he) as the labour of those Sacrifices
did cease at the coming of Christ, how should those
things be demanded, which were ordained <hi>for that
labour?</hi> And seeing (adds he) that the first Fruits
were not demanded of <hi>Christians,</hi> which first Fruits
were then (in the time of the Law) rather and
sooner demanded then the Tythes: why must the
Tythes be demanded, except it be therefore perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,
because that the Tythes be more worth
in value then the first Fruits.</q> In the end he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<q>Wherefore seeing that neither Christ, nor
any of the Apostles, commanded to pay Tythes;
it is manifest and plain, neither by the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
nor by Christ's Law, <hi>Christian</hi> People are
bound to pay Tythes: but by the Tradition of Men,
they are bound,</q>

            <p>The <hi>Bohemians</hi> also not long after, in their 15th
Article against the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy, say thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65611:51"/>
and preach and say that men are bound to pay them
Tythes, and <hi>therein they say falsly.</hi> For they cannot
prove by the New Testament, that our Lord Jesus
Christ commanded it, and his Disciples warned no
man to do so, neither did themselves receive them.
But although in the Old Testament it were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to give Tythes, yet it cannot thereby be
proved that <hi>Christian</hi> men are bound thereto. For
this precept of the old Law had an end in the first
Year of our Lord Jesus Christ, like as the Precept
of Circumcision. Wherefore well-beloved, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
and see how your Bishops <hi>seduce you,</hi> and
shut your Eyes with things that have <hi>no proof</hi> Christ
saith in the eleaventh of <hi>Luke,</hi> Give Alms of those
things that remain, but he said not, Give the
Tenth of the Goods which ye possess, but give
Alms, &amp;c.</q>

               <hi>William Fulk,</hi> in his Annotations on the <hi>Rhemists</hi>
Translation of the Bible, in Answer to <hi>those Iesuits,</hi>
who, with <hi>this Priest,</hi> would needs have Tythes to
be due by the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, saith thus (§. 4. on <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.)
<q>The payment of Tythes, as it was <hi>a Ceremonial duty,</hi>
is abrogated with other Ceremonies. But as it is
a necessary Maintenance of them that serve in the
Church it MAY be retained, or ANY OTHER
stipend appointed, that may be sufficient for their
Maintenance, be it MORE or LESS then the tenth
part. But that there is any Sacrificing Priest-hood,
to whom it is due in the New Testament, the old
payment of Tythes <hi>doth not prove:</hi> Neither did
Christ himself, our high Priest, ever make claim
unto them: nor his Apostles, the Ministers of the
Church, but only to a sufficient living by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
to be allowed of <hi>their</hi> temporal Goods, to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65611:51"/>
whom they ministred spiritual Goods,</q> 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 14.
Gal.</hi> 6. 6. Thus he (a man of no small note in the
<hi>English</hi> Church in Q. <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time) by which it
is evident that he accounted Tythes a part of the <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial</hi>
Law, <hi>abrogated</hi> by Christ. And although
he thought they might be retained as a necessary
Maintenance of them that serve in the Church, yet
he layes no more or greater stress on Tythes, then
on <hi>any other</hi> sufficient stipend, whether it were <hi>more</hi>
or <hi>less</hi> then the tenth part, which is directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to this Priests Assertion, of Tythes being due by
the eternal moral Law, which the Jesuits maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and <hi>Fulk</hi> denyed.</p>
            <p>Of the same judgment with <hi>Fulk</hi> was <hi>Andrew
Willet</hi> (a man of great account in the <hi>English</hi> Church
in K. <hi>Iames</hi> his time) He, in his <hi>Synopsis Papismi,</hi>
fifth general Controversie, pag. 313. sayes in the
name of the <hi>English</hi> Church, <q>We also acknowledge
(as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> seemeth to grant, Chap. 25.) that
to pay precisely the tenth, is <hi>not now commanded</hi> by
the Law of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as though that order could not
be changed by any human Law, as the Canonists
hold,</q> but men necessarily were bound to pay Tythes.
And a little after, <q>Though (sayes he) the Law of
Tenths be <hi>not now necessary,</hi> as it was <hi>Ceremonious:</hi>
but it is lawful either to keep that, or ANY OTHER
Constitution for the sufficient Maintenance of the
Church, whether it be MORE or LESS then the
tenth part: yet we doubt not to say, that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
for the Church-Maintenance by paying of
Tythes,</q> is the most safe, <hi>ibid.</hi> Here he plainly calls
the Law of Tythes Ceremonial, acknowledging that
men are <hi>not</hi> necessarily <hi>bound</hi> by the Law of God <hi>to
pay Tythes now:</hi> and although he accounts the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65611:52"/>
of Tythes, grounded upon human Laws, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
safest provision for the Church-maintenance; yet he
holds it equally lawful (with respect to the Law of
God) to appoint any other sufficient Maintenance,
although it be <hi>not precisely the tenth,</hi> but either <hi>more</hi>
or <hi>less</hi> then the tenth part. Which is utterly destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of the <hi>morality</hi> of Tythes. And indeed, he
makes Ministers Maintenance in general to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in Equity upon the Moral Law: but Tythes to
depend upon positive Laws, and he shews he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the <hi>Moguntine</hi> Synod so. But for the <hi>Levitical</hi>
Law of Tything, he calls it plainly a <hi>politick</hi> Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of that Country. His own words are, <q>The <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
Priest-hood being one whole Tribe, it was
thought reasonable that the tenth part of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns
Goods should be alotted to them; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a judicial and <hi>politick</hi> Constitution of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
doth <hi>neither</hi> necessarily <hi>bind</hi> Christians <hi>now,</hi>
neither is forbidden, but left in that respect indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</q>
And a little after, <q>Although it be a wise
and <hi>politick</hi> Constitution, that the People should
pay their Tythes, and MAY conveniently be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
yet it is <hi>not now of necessity imposed upon
Christians,</hi> as though no other provision for the
Church could serve but that,</q> pag. 314.</p>
            <p>Much more might be alledged out of these mens
Writings, to this purpose: but this in this place may
suffice to shew, that the judgment of the Church of
<hi>England</hi> in those times, was quite another thing in
this case, then it is now represented by this Priest to
be. But leaving these Testimonies to the Reader's
consideration, return we to the Author of the <hi>Right
of Tythes.</hi>

in the close of which he again repeats his <hi>so oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iterated</hi>
Suppositions. <hi>I conclude,</hi> sayes he, page
51. <hi>that part of our Substance being due to God by the
Natural and Divine Law.</hi> (For he will yet allow
God to have right <hi>but to a part:</hi> and it were worth
inquiry how God who is <hi>Eternally Lord of the World,</hi>
pag. 49. came to be <hi>disseized</hi> of his <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>whole,</hi>
and who it was that so compassionate to make him
a Title to <hi>some part</hi> again) <hi>And the Inspired</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
(sayes he) <hi>being taught by Revelation.</hi> (Of
which Revelation (say I) there is no Revelation,
but a bold presumption of his own) <hi>That the tenth</hi>
(sayes he) <hi>was his part, and the Priests of God were
his Receivers</hi> (which if it were true (say I) had been
Title sufficient for the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priests, without a
particular Law on purpose to make them due) <hi>God
himself</hi> (adds he) <hi>having approved also this payment</hi>
(which (say I) was not a payment, but a free and
voluntary Gift) <hi>by a Renewed claim</hi> (sayes he)
(though never claim'd before, say I) <hi>and an express
assignation</hi> (sayes he) <hi>of his Right under the</hi> Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Law <hi>to the Priests for the time being</hi> (but not to
any other Priests (say I) without a new assignation)
<hi>and the same God</hi> (sayes he) <hi>having the same Right
still to his part</hi> (and the same <hi>Lord of all,</hi> say I, having
the same <hi>Right</hi> still to <hi>all) and the same occasion</hi> (sayes
he) <hi>to use it for the Maintenance of his</hi> Ministers <hi>at
this day</hi> (not so, say I, for he neither hath such a
Tribe to maintain, nor such Service to imploy them
in at this day as then.) <hi>Hence</hi> (sayes he) <hi>I suppose
it will follow, That (unless an express repeal can be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
the Gospel Ministers in Gods Name, may justly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65611:53"/>
claim Tythes as due to them still, and that by a Divine
Right too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a <hi>Series</hi> of <hi>premises</hi> hath he drawn his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
through, to <hi>Issue</hi> it at last in a <hi>Suppositive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion!</hi>
But it is the less to be wondered at, since his
<hi>premises</hi> are mostly <hi>Suppositive</hi> also, leaning on <hi>conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and relying at best but on <hi>probability.</hi> But in
this last Clause I must needs say he has exprest him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with more Caution and less Confidence then
usually: for he speaks with a Reserve <hi>[unless an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
repeal can be shewed]</hi> to which I return him a
twofold Answer. 1. That an <hi>express repeal</hi> is not of
absolute necessity, and that for two reasons, 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
the Right which he pretends, and insists so
much on, antecedent to the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, is not
grounded upon an <hi>express Command;</hi> and what is
not expresly commanded, needs not be expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.
And therefore he might very well allow me
the same Liberty (if I either needed or listed to
use it) of arguing a Repeal form Suppostitions,
Guesses, Conjectures and Maybe's, which himself
uses to prove a Right. And not only so, but I might
also urge <hi>Argumentum ad hominem,</hi> and put him
shrewdly to it, by asking him, <hi>Where he reads that
Tythes are not repealed;</hi> and telling him (as he doth me,
pag. 31.) That <hi>he cannot prove Tythes are not repealed,
and I can make it appear very probable they are.</hi> But
having Noted this as a weakness in him, I will not
Answer him after this manner, because I would not
be like unto him. 2. Because the <hi>express Assignation</hi>
of the Right of Tythes under the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law,
was (as hims<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lf words it, pag. 51.) <hi>to the Priests for
the time being;</hi> and common Reason and experience
tell us that when a Deed or Assig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ment is made to a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65611:53"/>
man for his life, there is no need, upon the Death
of the Assigne, of a new deed to declare the old one
void, the Death of him sufficiently declaring that,
to the Term of whose Life the Assignment was at first
restrayned. Now the Assignation of Tythes to the
Priests under the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, was for and during
the life of that Priesthood (if I may so express it)
and had that Assignment been made void while that
Priesthood lived, there had then indeed been need of
an express Repeal. But seeing it was not made void in
the life tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of that Priesthood, but continued in force
as long as that Priesthood lived, the Death or Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of that Priesthood did <hi>vocate</hi> the Assignation
in course. And there is no more Reason to expect
an express Repeal of it, then there would be, if the
Parliament should make a Law to continue for <hi>three
years,</hi> to expect that, at the <hi>three years</hi> end, they should
make another Law on purpose to declare the first void.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears that an <hi>express</hi> Repeal of Tythes
<hi>by name</hi> was not of absolute necessity, in relation
to either Claim. Not in relation to the <hi>Ant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>-Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
Claim, that Claim it self <hi>not being grounded
upon any express Command:</hi> nor with respect to the
Assignation he speaks of under the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law,
that Assignation being at first <hi>limited to a certain time,</hi>
to the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iests for the time being, as himself expresses
it, pag. 51. Yet <hi>Secondly,</hi> to put it out of all doubt
that <hi>Tythes</hi> are indeed <hi>ended</hi> with that legal Priest-hood,
the holy Apostle, by the Divine Spirit, hath
most plainly and <hi>expresly</hi> affirmed, <hi>That the Priest-hood
being changed, there is made of necessity a change
also of the Law,</hi> Heb. 7. 12. Here is an express Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
of the Law, by which the Assignation of Tythes
to that Priesthood was made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:65611:54"/>
Thus have I brought him to the end of his second
Period, and in the way have made it evident that
<hi>Tythes were not founded on the Law of Nature,</hi> but
on the <hi>Levit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

an inherent equity</hi> in them, nor did rely on an <hi>internal
Rectitude,</hi> or <hi>eternal Reason,</hi> but on an <hi>external Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
and <hi>temporal Reason,</hi> suitable to the Polity of
that State. That as the Sacrifices and other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Law, were not the Worship of God
it self, which was founded upon the Law of Nature;
but <hi>

in general to the Ministers of the Gospel is just, reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and establisht by a Divine Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this grant he is greatly pleased, and hopes
from hence to <hi>scre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> a Right to Tythes; but he is
as greatly mistaken also, for Tythes I am sure can
never be <hi>squc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s'd</hi> out of that Concession. He at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
it thus, <hi>Let him</hi> (sayes he, pag. 52.) <hi>but stand
to this grant, and then it will follow, That the Ministers
of the Gospel may claim a Maintenance in general,</hi> jure
divino, <hi>for that Maintenance which is established by
Divine Authority is due</hi> jure divino.</p>
            <p>This might very well have been spared, being no
more then is contained in the Grant it self: I expect
his Inference, which such an one as it is, here follows,
<hi>And why then</hi> (sayes he) <hi>should not that Maintenance
still be so due, which God directed before the</hi> Law, <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
under the</hi> Law, <hi>and never repea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> carbones!</hi> I expected he would
have drawn up some notable Conclusion from my
Concession; but instead thereof <hi>lo a Petition! Petitio
Principij,</hi> a begging of the Question, namely, that
<hi>Tythes were directed by God before the</hi> Law, <hi>and never
repealed after the</hi> Law (for their being approved
under the Law, conduces nothing to their continuance
under the Gospel) He would very fain all along have
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:65611:55"/>
it <hi>granted,</hi> that Tythes were grounded on the Law
of Nature, that the <hi>tenth</hi> part was alwayes Gods <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>
part, as he is eternally Lord of the World,
and that the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> before the Law were by
<hi>special <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>velation</hi> commanded to pay Tythes, but
this cannot be granted. He knows the Proverb,
<hi>Win it and wear it.</hi> If he can prove it, let him;
if not, he must be content to forego it. And for the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
of Tythes</hi> after the Law, it is before Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively
Argued both from the <hi>Dissolution of the
Priesthood</hi> to which the <hi>expiration of the Term</hi> for
which, and the <hi>express repeal</hi> of the Law by which they
were granted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds,</hi> ibid. If the Divine Authority hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
a Maintenance, that supposeth it was such a
Maintenance as was due before, according to <hi>T. E. pag.</hi>
318.</p>
            <p>I deny that the establishing a Maintenance
doth suppose there was a Maintenance due be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but it doth not infer a <hi>parity</hi> of Maintenance.
It doth not follow, that because there was a
Maintenance due before, therefore the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
thus established must needs be <hi>the same,</hi> or
such a Maintenance as was before due. Neither is
this according to me, as he sayes, but according to
himself, and his <hi>perversion</hi> of my words, pag. 318.
Where noting my opponent of <hi>instability</hi> in his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
I observe that he uses the words [Create and
Establish] promiscuously, as if they were synonimous.
And to shew their different acceptions, I tell him, That
if he will say, <hi>Temporal Authority hath created</hi> ('tis
his own words) <hi>a Right to Tythes, he thereby cuts off
all pretentions to any Right antecedent to that Creation.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65611:55"/>
If he will say, that temporal Authority hath only esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blisht
a temporal Right to Tythes, that supposes a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Right to them before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observe, I did not say, that supposes <hi>such</hi> a temporal
Right to them as was before; but that supposes a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Right to them before. So here when I say, <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority hath established a maintenance in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
&amp;c. the word [ESTABLISH] doth not sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it to be <hi>such</hi> a Maintenance as was due before,
but supposes only that there was <hi>a Maintenance in
general due before,</hi> which is far enough from restrayin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to a <hi>particular kind</hi> of Maintenance. Thus
he at once abuses me and his Reader, and makes good
the saying, <hi>Posito uno Errore, sequuntur Mille.</hi> For
upon this false and weak Supposition that the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Maintenance supposes it to be <hi>such</hi> a Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
as was due before, he bestirs himself to prove
that Tythes were due before. In order whereunto,
after his wonted manner, supplying his Defects with
Confidence, he peremptorily affirms, pag. 53. that
<hi>the Maintnance paid to Gods Ministers before the
Law and under it, was Tythes.</hi> The payment of
Tythes <hi>under the</hi> Law is not questionable, as well as
<hi>not imitable.</hi> But for the time before the Law, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
him to be less peremptory, and more Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
If he please, I would gladly know who those
Ministers were to whom <hi>Tythes</hi> as a <hi>Maintenance</hi>
were <hi>paid before</hi> the Law; seeing the Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth
<hi>Mel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hizedec</hi> only to have received
Tythes, and that but <hi>once,</hi> nor then as a PAYMENT,
but a GIFT. And when he is upon this Subject, he
may seasonably explain his next Sentence also, which
is this, <hi>The Priest-hood of</hi> Melchizedec, <hi>and of</hi> Levi,
<hi>both were so maintained,</hi> namely, by Tythes. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:65611:56"/>
of <hi>Levi</hi> is clear, but <hi>not to this purpose.</hi> But
that the Priest-hood of <hi>Melchi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>edec</hi> was maintained
by Tythes will be <hi>hard</hi> I think for him <hi>to prove. Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedec</hi>
himself, as I noted before, never received
Tythes <hi>but once,</hi> that we read of, and then he was at
a considerable charge too (for it cannot be thought
so great a Troop as <hi>Abraham</hi> led with him, three
hundred and eighteen of his own Domesticks,
besides his Confederates <hi>Aner, Escol</hi> and
<hi>Mamre,</hi> could be refresht with Bread and Wine,
for <hi>a small matter)</hi> which expence deducted out of
the Tythe he received, unlikely it is the remainder
should be enough to maintain him all the time of his
Priest-hood, if he, who was a King, and by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
comparison, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. greater then <hi>Abraham</hi> had
needed such a Maintenance. And for <hi>Iacob,</hi> though
it is not to be doubted but he performed his Vow,
yet after what manner he performed it, is not agreed
on; some thinking he paid his <hi>Tythes</hi> in kind <hi>to they
know not whom</hi> (of which number this Priest is one,
pag. 38.) Others with greater probability and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Authority, that he offered them by way of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
immediately to God. However it was, <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizedec</hi>
could not have them, if we understand him
to be <hi>Sem,</hi> since most agree that <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m</hi> was buried long
before. So that the holy Text affords no countenance
at all to this over-bold Assertion, that <hi>Melchizedec</hi>'s
Priesthood was maintained by Tythes.</p>
            <p>§. 2. He charges me pag. 53. with striving to
pervert two Texts (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6.) by two
limitations. <hi>First,</hi> in saying, The Apostle's intent
in those Scriptures is not so much to set forth what the
Maintenance is, as who they are from whom it is to be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:65611:56"/>
received, namely such as receive their Ministry, such
as believe them to be true Ministers, such as are
taught by them, <hi>&amp;c. This,</hi> he saves, <hi>is a notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
falshood, for in</hi> 1 Cor. 9. <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>is all along speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Ministers Right to be maintained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is far enough from proving my words a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
falshood, namely, that his intent is not <hi>so much</hi>
to set forth what the Maintenance is, <hi>as</hi> who they
are from whom it is to be received: for his speaking
of the Ministers Right to be maintained, is not a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth what the <hi>maintenance</hi> is. But he would
perswade his Reader that the Apostles drift was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to set forth what the Maintenance is: for sayes
he, <hi>He shews what Maintenance was due to the</hi> Jewish
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inisters, affirming that Christ had ordained [even so]
that we should l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e of the Gospel, that is, the Rights of
God under the Gospel, and the acknowledgments made to
him for the Mercy therein revealed. The things of
the</hi> Christian <hi>Temple and Altar were to be our Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
And is not this to say what the Maintenance
is? not a word in all this, who should pay it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This yet even as he has worded it, though he has
added his own divination to the Text, doth not <hi>so
much</hi> express what the Maintenance is, <hi>as</hi> from whom
to be received. He sayes, <hi>The Apostle shews what
Maintenance was due to the</hi> Jewish <hi>Ministers, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that Christ had ordained</hi> [even so] <hi>that we should
live of the Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>[Even so]</hi> as the <hi>Iewish</hi> Priests lived <hi>under
the Law!</hi> What! <hi>just the very same Maintenance</hi> as
they had in <hi>every</hi> respect! Not so, I trow, then
this doth not express <hi>what the Maintenance is,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it doth that <hi>there is a Maintenance.</hi> But the
Priest explains his <hi>[even so]</hi> that is, sayes he, the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:65611:57"/>
               <hi>Rights of God under the Gospel;</hi> What are they?
Has not God a Right to ALL under the Gospel, as
well as he had under the Law and before it? How
then doth this express <hi>what the Maintenance is?</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
he means that <hi>he would have all?</hi> Besides, he
adds another branch of this Maintenance, <hi>viz. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments
made to God for the mercy revealed in
the Gospel,</hi> and these he seems to make <hi>distinct</hi> from
the Rights of God: for <hi>First,</hi> he reckons the Rights
of God, and then these acknowledgments made to
him. But what are these? are they not <hi>voluntary,</hi>
arbitrary, <hi>uncertain?</hi> And is this to set forth a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
Maintenance? How doth this man darken
Counsel by <hi>words without Vnderstanding?</hi> Job
38. 2.</p>
            <p>But while he charges me with notorious falshood
in saying, the Apostles intent in this place is not <hi>so
much</hi> to set forth what the Maintenance is, as who
they are from whom it is to be received, which is
indeed a plain Truth; is not he himself guilty of the
notorious falshood he labours so much to fasten on
me? in saying here, <hi>Not a word in all this who should
pay it;</hi> when as from the very entrance of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
upon this Subject, the Apostle labours to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the believing <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that it was <hi>from
THEM he might r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ceive Maintenance.</hi> And he
grounded his Argument on this especially, that
THEY had been taught by <hi>him,</hi> and had received his
Ministry. <hi>Are not YOV my Work in the Lord?</hi> saith
he, Vers. 1. <hi>If I be not an Apostle unto others, yet
doubtless I am to YOV: for the Seal of my Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
are YE in the Lord,</hi> Vers. 2. Then besides the
instances he uses of a <hi>Souldier,</hi> a <hi>Planter,</hi> a <hi>Shepherd,</hi>
he Argues plainly from THEIR having received
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65611:57"/>
               <hi>first</hi> of him, Vers. 11. <hi>If we have sown unto YOV

YOVR Carnal things</hi> and Vers. 12. <hi>If others he
partakers of this Power over YOV, are not we rather?</hi>
From all which it is most apparent that he makes his
labour amongst THEM and THEIR receiving <hi>his</hi>
Ministry, the Ground and Reason of his Demand.
Is not his Expostulation with THEM particularly,
who had received the Gospe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> through <hi>his</hi> Ministry?

Apostleship in the Lord; YOURS, unto whom

from whom the Maintenance should be received.</hi> Was
this man well advised to Tax me with a <hi>notorious fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
for but saying, The intent of the Apostle is
not <hi>so much</hi> to set forth what the Maintenance is, as
who they are from whom it is to be received? (by
which words <hi>[not so much]</hi> it appears I did not <hi>whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
exclude the Maintenance, but shewed that the
Maintenance was not in this place so <hi>particularly</hi> and

is, as I have done him, <hi>who they are</hi> from whom it is

say the same? Is not this the free and unconstrained

not whether the Ox should be fed or no; but who
in equity are bound to feed him, they by whom he

                  </gap>e the Ox trod out Corn for one

been unreasonable.</hi> Now how <hi>unrighteous</hi> is this man,

and how <hi>impertinent,</hi> to argue that <hi>the Ox must
not be starved, though he be not actually imployed by

that the controversie rested upon that point, whether
the Ox should be fed, <hi>though by him for whom he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured,</hi>
any longer then he was in <hi>actual</hi> imployment,
which was no part at all of the Controversie; but
whether while he was imployed <hi>in one man's service,</hi>
while he was treading out Corn <hi>for one man, another,</hi>
for whom he did <hi>no service,</hi> should be <hi>bound</hi> to keep
him. This I said was <hi>unreasonable,</hi> and not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to equity. The same I now again affirm, and
dare expose it to the strongest assault my Opponent is
able to make against it. Now for the latter place,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 6. The Priest sayes, S. <hi>Paul tells them, they must
give the Ministers a part of all their good things; and
is not that</hi> (saith he) <hi>a declaring what the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
is?</hi> By this he would again insinuate that I had
altogether denyed there was <hi>any kind</hi> of character or
description at all of the Maintenance in these Texts,
which is very unworthily done of him: for he knows
fulwell my words are <hi>not positive,</hi> but <hi>comparative.</hi>
I do not say the Apostle doth not <hi>at all</hi> set forth what
the Maintenance is, but that the intent of the Apostle
in those Scriptures, is not <hi>so much</hi> to set forth what
the Maintenance is, as who they are from whom it
is to be received. And that the Maintenance it self
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65611:59"/>
is not <hi>so much</hi> set forth, not <hi>so plainly, fully, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</hi>
and <hi>positively</hi> declared and described in these
Texts, as the maintainers, the Persons from whom it
is to be received, I have already shewed on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Scripture, and shall do now on this also. <hi>Let him</hi>
(saith the Apostle) <hi>that is taught in the word, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate

Here now is <hi>most plainly</hi> and fully declared <hi>who it is</hi>
that is thus to communicate, <hi>who it is</hi> from whom the
Maintenance is to be received, namely, <hi>he that is
taught in the word:</hi> but what the Maintenance is to
be is not <hi>so</hi> plainly, <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> fully, <hi>so</hi> particularly set forth;
but in a general term, <hi>In all good things.</hi> No <hi>quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
exprest, whether a <hi>tenth,</hi> a <hi>fifth,</hi> a <hi>fifteenth,</hi> or
a <hi>twentieth</hi> part, but lest to the <hi>free will</hi> of the giver,
which renders the proportion <hi>uncertain.</hi> In which
respect, the Maintenance here is not <hi>so plainly, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly</hi>
and <hi>certainly</hi> exprest, as it is <hi>from whom</hi> it
should come, which is positively and certainly bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and limited to <hi>him that is taught in the word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 3. <hi>He confesses, pag. 55. (for he cannot avoid
it) that the Apostle sayes indeed,</hi> He that is taught
in the word must give this; but that <hi>(sayes he)</hi> is to
distinguish <hi>Christians</hi> from <hi>Heathens,</hi> of which the
World was then full. The Heathen <hi>(he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges)</hi>
was not bound to maintain the Gospel-ministers,
but the Catehumen, the <hi>Christian</hi> who was or might be
taught, if his own Laziness, or Pride, or Obstinacy
hindred not.</p>
            <p>Is this according to the Text? Doth the Apostle
say, Let him that is, <hi>or might be</hi> taught, <hi>not if his own
Laziness, or Pride, or Obstinacy hindred,</hi> c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,
&amp;c? He who was so careful to Preach <hi>the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:65611:59"/>
Gospel of Christ without charge, 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 18. He that
would not <hi>reap Carnals,</hi> but where he had <hi>before
sown Spirituals,</hi> nor there neither alwayes; He who
was so wary whom he received of, that he would not
use the just power he had of receiving Maintenance
from them who were his own work in the Lord, and
the very seal of his Apostleship; can it be thought
that he would be maintained <hi>by the Lazy, the Proud,
the Obstinate!</hi> May it be supposed that he, who sayes,
Let them that are taught in the word communicate,
&amp;c. would have them also communicate, who <hi>are
not taught,</hi> but are <hi>hindred from being taught</hi> by their
own Laziness, or Pride, or Obstinacy! If <hi>all such</hi>
should be drawn in to maintain the Gospel-Ministers,
who then should be left out! Upon what reason then
were the <hi>Heathens</hi> exempted? <hi>might</hi> not they have
been <hi>taught, if their own Laziness, Pride, or Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy
had not hindred?</hi> So that, although the Priest
sayes, <hi>The</hi> Heathen <hi>was not bound to maintain the
Gospel-Ministers;</hi> yet according as he has <hi>glost</hi> the
Text, and by the same reason upon which he would
bring in such as <hi>might</hi> be taught, but are not; the
very <hi>Heathen</hi> is liable to be brought in also to this
Communication for the Ministers Maintenance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
though <hi>he is not, he might be taught if his own
Laziness, Pride or Obstinacy did not hinder.</hi> This is
indeed a notable way to advance the Priests Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
but neither is this way agreeable to <hi>natural
Reason</hi> or <hi>Gospel-Truth,</hi> nor are they Ministers of
the Gospel, who can receive, much less <hi>exact</hi> a Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
after this manner.</p>
            <p>He sayes, ibid. That <hi>still this</hi> (speaking of <hi>Gal.</hi>
6. 6.) <hi>proves not</hi> T. E.'s <hi>foolish inference, That none
must contribute to a Ministers Maintenance, but those
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:65611:60"/>
that are taught by him actually.</hi> What <hi>quirk</hi> he cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
under the word <hi>[actually]</hi> I know not. Sure I
am, he found it not in any inference of mine. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
if he intend no more by being <hi>actually taught</hi>
then the Apostle expresses, <hi>[Let him that is taught,</hi>
&amp;c.] I shall not think much of <hi>his calling me Fool,</hi>
having so <hi>good</hi> and so <hi>wise</hi> a Man as the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
to bear me company in this <hi>Reproach.</hi> And indeed,
I had rather be <hi>thought a Fool,</hi> for sticking to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle's
sense, then <hi>found a Knave</hi> by perverting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is
sense, to uphold a <hi>selfish</hi> interest. But if the Priest
had been desirous of an Inference of mine to consute,
he needed not have formed an Inference for me: for in
pag. 286. of my Book, he might have found a pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
together, very pertinent to this purpose, as having
respect not to this Text only, but that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.
also, in these words, <hi>All therefore that can be inferred
from these Instances will amount to no more then this,</hi>
First, <hi>That a Gospel Minister may expect and receive
a Gospel Maintenance from such as receive his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</hi>
2dly. <hi>That a Gospel Minister oug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t not to expect
any Maintenance from those that do not receive his
Ministry.</hi> This is plain and full, and as I take it, <hi>close
to the Point;</hi> &amp; it may be he takes it so too, which made
him not willing to undertake it, but fairly pass it by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds, ibid. That</hi> these places say nothing against
a Gospel-Minister's receiving Maintenance from all
professed <hi>Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is somewhat like his saying before that I could
not make it appear <hi>Abraham did not pay Tythes.</hi> If
from these places he would derive his Claim, it will
not be enough, that <hi>they speak not against</hi> what he
claims, but it is requisite they should <hi>speak for it,</hi> and
that <hi>plainly</hi> too. But these places are so far from
speaking <hi>for</hi> such a Latitude as he aim at, of <hi>scra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:65611:60"/>

               </gap>o but bear the Name of <hi>Christians,</hi> that they speak
<hi>against it.</hi> The instances of the <hi>Ox,</hi> the <hi>Souldier,</hi> the

Maintenance is due <hi>to</hi> those that <hi>labour, fight,</hi> take
<hi>pains</hi> and <hi>care</hi> for others, so its due <hi>from them for whose
sak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s</hi> the labour, hazard, pains and care is undergone
and <hi>to whose benefit</hi> it redounds. And in the two last
instan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of the <hi>Planter</hi> and <hi>Shepherd</hi> (which may
explain the other two, being of like application) the
Apostle sends the Planter <hi>for Fruit</hi> directly <hi>to the
Vineyard of his own planting;</hi> and the Shepherd <hi>for
Milk,</hi> to the Flock of his <hi>own feeding.</hi> The Shepherd
was not to go to <hi>another</hi> Flock, and say, <hi>These are
Sheep too,</hi> and therefore <hi>I'le Milk them, I'le Fleece
them:</hi> but he was to consider, whether <hi>he had fed
them,</hi> and if he had not fed them, he had no reason to
expect Milk from them. For if <hi>Paul</hi> had not <hi>sowed</hi>
unto the <hi>Corinthians spiritual things,</hi> it had then
been a great matter for him to have reaped <hi>their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
things. But he grounds the reasonableness and
equity of his Right to their <hi>carnal</hi> things, upon the
labour <hi>he</hi> had bestowed on <hi>them,</hi> and benefit <hi>they</hi> had
received by <hi>him</hi> in <hi>spiritual</hi> things. And in his other
Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he plainly shews that as he
that teaches was to be communicated to, so the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
was to be <hi>from him that was taught.</hi> And
as this was the Doctrine, such also was the Practice of
the Apostle. He was not forward to <hi>pick up a Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi>
from every one that profest <hi>Christianity,</hi> as
appears in the case of <hi>Lydia,</hi> who was fain to use
more for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ible Arguments, then her bare profession
of <hi>Christianity,</hi> but to get him to her House, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him, and those that were with him, <hi>if they judged
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:65611:61"/>
her faithful to the Lord,</hi> to come into her House, and
abide there, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 15. Neither were the Disciples,
when they were sent forth to Preach permitted by
their Master to receive so much a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Food from any but
those that received their Message, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 8, 10, 11.
So that all along the New Testament, wheresoever
there is mention of Ministers Maintenance, it is with
relation to them that own the Ministry.</p>
            <p>But this the Priest doth by no means like, well
knowing the loss that he and his Brethren would su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain,
if none should be bound to maintain them, but
such as own their Ministry; and therefore he uses all
his, endeavour to avoid the force of this Argument.
He would put it by, first, by urging, pag. 56. that
<hi>according to the</hi> Quakers <hi>Principles, the</hi> Christians <hi>of
Old were all immediately taught by inward Revelation;
And if so</hi> (sayes he) <hi>what need any Gospel-Ministry
at all? What need of outward Means? What need had
they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o have any Teachers of the Word? Or with what
equity could this Teacher require Maintenance of them,
that had no occasion for his teaching at all?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Christians</hi> of Old were all immediately taugh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
by inward Revelation, yet it doth not thereon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that there was no need of any Gospel Ministry
at all, as he supposes. For if the <hi>Christians</hi> of old
were all immediately taught by inward Revelation;
yet <hi>a time there was when they were not so taught,</hi> but
were <hi>unconverted</hi> to the Faith of Christ. The
Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> Chap.
5. Vers. 8. tels them, <hi>Ye are now Light in the Lord.</hi>
But withal he adds, <hi>Ye were sometime Darkness.</hi> Now
how came these <hi>Ephesians</hi> to be changed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to Light? Was it not by the means of a Gospel
Ministry? Doth not the same Apostle speaking of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65611:61"/>
the Ministry committed to him, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 16, 17,
18. say expresly that he was made a Minister, <hi>to
open the Eyes of the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and to turn them from
Darkness to Light, &amp; from the Power of Satan unto God?</hi>
Thus the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> who were sometimes Darkness,
came to be Light in the Lord, having their Eyes
opened, and being by this Ministry turned from the
Darkness to the Lig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t. Nor was it thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi>
only, but with both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
The work of the Gospel Ministry was to turn
both <hi>Ie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> from the Darkness and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of <hi>Iudaism</hi> and <hi>Gentilism</hi> to the Light and Faith
of Christ Jesus. Now if after they were so turn'd
from the Darkness to the Light, and from the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
to the Faith, they were immediately taught by
inward Revelation; yet it cannot possibly be suppos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
they were so taught before they were so turned,
while they were <hi>in the Darknes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and <hi>in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief.</hi>
So that there was <hi>need</hi> of that Ministry to
turn them from Darkness to the Light, and from
Unbelief to the Faith, in order to bring them to that
inward Revelation by which they might be taught.
Hence it appears, that if what he asserts to be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Principles should be granted,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Christians</hi> of old were <hi>all</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taught by inward Revelation, yet his inference
from thence of <hi>no need of a Gospel Ministry at all,</hi>
is fals<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, since there was <hi>need</hi> of a Gospel Ministry to
bring them to <hi>that State</hi> wherein they might be <hi>so
taught.</hi> And though this work of gathering People
out of the <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Heathenish</hi> States to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Faith, of turning them from the Darkness (in
which they could not see) to the Light of the
Gospel (by which they might see the Divine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:65611:62"/>
of the heavenly Kingdom) was the first and
chief work of the Ministry; yet was it not the
only end or service to which that Ministry was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and for which it was <hi>indued with Power</hi> from
on High. For when Christ ascended up on High,
and led Captivity Captive, <hi>he gave Gifts unto men,
for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the
Ministry, for the edifying of the Body of Christ,</hi> Eph.
4. So that the work of the Ministry was not only
to bring to the Faith, but to build up th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Saints in
the Faith, whereunto they were brought by it:
which twice in one Epistle the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> affirms,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 8. and 13. 10. And very Serviceable to the
Saints was the Ministry of that day, even to <hi>them who
knew the Truth</hi> and were <hi>established in it,</hi> them that
had <hi>received the anointing,</hi> had it <hi>abiding in them,</hi> and
were <hi>taught by it,</hi> by <hi>exhorting them</hi> to keep to it,
and to abide in it; by <hi>putting them</hi> frequently in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi>
of their duty, and <hi>stirring up</hi> their pure
minds thereto, in which they were <hi>helpers</hi> of the Saints
joy. Here then the Priest is found in an Error, in
infering a Conclusion which doth not follow from his
own premises. For if it were granted him that the
<hi>Christians</hi> of old were all immediately taught by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Revelation; yet it doth not thence follow,
that there was no need of any Gospel Ministry at
all; since it is evident a Gospel Ministry was <hi>alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
needful</hi> to gather them to the true Faith, and
direct them to the inward teaching; and <hi>very useful</hi>
and <hi>serviceable</hi> to <hi>confirm</hi> and <hi>build up</hi> in the Faith, even
those who are come to the anointing in themselves,
and were taught by it.</p>
            <p>But seeing the Priest upon a false hope that he had
gotten an advantage, adventures so far as to argue
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65611:62"/>
equity, a thing rare to be found amongst them; and
upon a wrong conclusion asks, <hi>With what equity could
this Teacher require Maintenance of them, that had
no occasion for his Teachi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g at all?</hi> I will assure both
him and his Brethren (in the name of all my fellow
<hi>Quakers,</hi> as he calls them, the meanest of which
(that is truly such) I heartily embrace as my fellow)
that the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as they have no good Opinion of
his or his Brethren's reaching, so they have no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be taught by them, <hi>nor have any occasion for
their teaching at all, being far better taught without
them.</hi> And hereupon I ask him in his own words, <hi>With
what equity be and his fellow Priests can require
Maintenance of them, that have no occasion for their
teaching at all?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His second shift to void the force of those Text<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
which restrain the Ministers Maintenance to them
that receive and own the Ministry, and to justify the
Priests practice of extorting Tythes from those that
are not taught by them, is an exact Parallel Case, as
he calls it, which he thus brings in, pag.</hi> 57. Suppose
a pious man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>sayes he,</hi> an hundred Years ago did

condition that all the Boyes in such a Town should be

just or reasonable to stop 10 <hi>l.</hi> of the 20 <hi>l.</hi> because half
the Boyes do not co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

is the very case between the present <hi>Clergy</hi> and the
<hi>Quakers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he mistakes in this as well as the rest. His
Parallel will not hold between the <hi>Quakers</hi> and the
Boyes; for the Boyes in this case, whether they
come to School or stay away, <hi>are not concerned</hi> in the
Maintenance of the Master, but the <hi>Quakers</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they hear the Priest or stay away <hi>are concerned</hi>
(more then they should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e) in the Maintenance of
the Priest. The School-master has <hi>no advantage at
all from the Boyes, if they come to be taught,</hi> for he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
his stipend from another hand, <hi>without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance
on the Boyes.</hi> And if the Boyes come not to
be taught, they <hi>suffer nothing,</hi> they <hi>lose nothing,</hi> for
as they <hi>receive nothing,</hi> they <hi>pay nothing.</hi> But the
Case is far otherwise between the Priest and the
<hi>Quakers.</hi> For <hi>the Priest comes for his Mainten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nce to
the</hi> Quakers, and has his dependance <hi>on their labour,</hi>
and whether the <hi>Quakers</hi> come to hear <hi>or no,</hi> to be
sure he make <hi>them pay,</hi> that is, he tears away their
Substance from them. See now the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Boyes and the <hi>Quakers;</hi> the Boyes <hi>pay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
though they <hi>are</hi> taught, but the <hi>Quakers must
pay</hi> though they are <hi>not</hi> taught. The <hi>Boyes are taught
for nothing:</hi> the <hi>Quakers pay for nothing.</hi> Is this his
<hi>exact</hi> Parallel, his <hi>very</hi> Case! If he would have made
the Boyes Case Parallel with the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he should
have <hi>supposed</hi> the Masters stipend was to be raised
<hi>out of the Boyes earnings,</hi> as the Priests Maintenance

Priests uncapable of <hi>Preaching the Gospel;</hi> or if the
Boyes had found the Master had taught <hi>false Latine,</hi>
as the <hi>Quakers</hi> have found by sad experience, the

would have been much more <hi>commendable</hi> for seeking
out an <hi>abler Teacher,</hi> then the Master could have been
<hi>excusable</hi> for taking away the <hi>Poor Boyes Money,</hi>
when he <hi>neither did,</hi> nor <hi>could do</hi> them <hi>any good.</hi> I
might here shew the disparity and unaptness of his
Comparison in many other particulars also, both as to
the Donation, the certainty of stipend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But
this which is said will I doubt not sufficiently manifest,
that instead of shewing the <hi>fallacy</hi> of my arguing

should first say, Divine Authority hath only establisht

in words <hi>as mine,</hi> which he certainly knows

(sayes he) <hi>this seems some-what strange, that</hi> T. E.
<hi>should first say, Divine Authority had only establisht
a maintenance in general, and in the next page but one,
affirm, that the same Authority hath particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
what this maintenance must be.</hi> Here he affirms,
that in one page I say, Divine Authority had <hi>only</hi>
established a Maintenance in general, and that in the
next page but one I affirm, the same Authority hath
<hi>particularly</hi> expressed what this Maintenance must
be; where the words <hi>[only]</hi> in the first place, and
<hi>[particularly]</hi> in the second, are <hi>not</hi> my words, but
his own, thrust in on purpose to <hi>abuse</hi> me, and render
my sayings absurd and contradictory. In the first of
those places, pag. 284. he refers to, my words are
plainly thus. <hi>That a Maintenance in general to the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>inisters of the Gospel, is Iust, Reasonable, and
established by a Divine Authority, I grant.</hi> Here's
no such word as <hi>[only]</hi> and yet he affirms, that I
here say, Divine Authority had <hi>only</hi> established a
Maintenance in general. In the other place, pag.
286. My words are, <hi>But what this Gospel Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
is, is expresly set down by Christ himself.</hi>
Here's not the word <hi>[particularly]</hi> and yet he
sayes, I here affirm, That the same Authority hath
<hi>particularly</hi> expressed what this Maintenance is. And
the better to perswade the Reader that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> had so writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as he reports me, when he first repeats my saying
that Christ hath expresly set down what this Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
is, he adds in the same Character [viz. <hi>only
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:65611:64"/>
meat and drink]</hi> as if he had taken these words also
out of my Book together with the other; and then
sayes, <hi>Truly, this seems some-what strange.</hi> Doth
it so <hi>more shame for him that made it seem so.</hi> Truly it
would seem the more strange to me also, that he should
deal so unjustly by me, had he not served me in the
like manner <hi>more then once</hi> before. Nor can it be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
this happened by chance, since he insists deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately
on it, and argues from it. For he sayes,
<hi>If Christ have allotted the particular maintenance, then
he hath not left it to generals; if he have established it
only in general, then he hath not expressed the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</hi>
And he improves his argument to this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>One of these must be false, for indeed there is a
manifest Contradiction.</hi> But does he not know which
of them is false? I will tell him then, <hi>'Tis that which
he has falsified, to make the contradiction.</hi> But till
he had thus corrupted them, there was neither fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
nor contradiction in them, nor any thing else
that might seem strange. For, if the first part had
been a <hi>Position,</hi> as it was but <hi>a Concession,</hi> yet I hope
it had been no Contradiction to say, first, That a
Maintenance in general is established by a Divine
Authority; and afterwards, That Christ hath expresly
set down what this Maintenance is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he goes on upon this willful mistake, that I
say, The Maintenance is only Meat and Drink. And
having first bestowed his usual</hi> Livery <hi>of</hi> folly <hi>upon
me, he yields, pag. 60. that in those Texts which I
cited out of St.</hi> Matthew, <hi>and St.</hi> Luke, <hi>the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
set down is Meat and Drink.</hi> When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
<hi>(sayes he)</hi> went to the prejudiced and unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Jews</hi> with the first news of the Gospel, meat and
drink was as much as they could expect; and Christ
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:65611:65"/>
bids them to take that and be contented. <hi>But this he
sayes was</hi> upon a particular occasion, and to apply these
Rules to all <hi>Ministers,</hi> or to the general Commission he
gave them afterwards, is the most rididulous and absurd
thing imaginable.</p>
            <p>Though the Disciples were then sent but into the
Cities of <hi>Iudea,</hi> yet the Service they went upon was
<hi>the same</hi> then as after, <hi>viz.</hi> Preaching the Gospel.
And if the <hi>Iews,</hi> amongst whom they then went,
were prejudiced and unbelieving, both <hi>Iews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> amongst whom they went afterwards,
were prejudiced and unbelieving also. So that to
urge this as a reason why meat and drink was as much
as they could expect, and therefore that they were
to take that and be contented, is weak arguing; for
it supposes they were to be content with that, <hi>because
they could get no more,</hi> whereas they were not to take
<hi>so much as that,</hi> unless it were freely given, and by
them that were worthy; he who opened the hearts of
any to give that, could have enlarged their hearts to
give much more, had he pleased. But if to apply
the Maintenance in these places exprest, to the general
Commission given afterward be absurd (as he sayes)
where shall we find any other Maintenance to apply to
that Commission, since he that gave the Commission
mentions no other Maintenance but this?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he sayes, pag.</hi> 60. When Christ bids his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
to take Meat and Drink, and be content, he doth
no where forbid them to receive more, if good men freely
gave it to them.</p>
            <p>I do not say he did. But the Question is not what
<hi>freedom</hi> they might use in receiving what <hi>good men
freely</hi> gave them: But what was <hi>due</hi> unto them for
their Service, and what they might <hi>justly expect.</hi>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:65611:65"/>
Which although my <hi>injurious</hi> Opponent would in my
Name limit to Meat and Drink <hi>only;</hi> yet as I used not
those terms <hi>[Only Meat and Drink]</hi> so neither do I
think the intent of our Saviour was to tye up his
Ministers to Meat and Drink <hi>only,</hi> in the strict and
literal sense of the words, but by the phrase of <hi>eating
and drinking</hi> to intimate the <hi>necessary Conveniences</hi> of
Life. And so the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> seems to understand
it, when speaking of Maintenance, with reference
to these Texts, as his Phrase gives ground to believe,
he sayes, <hi>Have w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Phrase <hi>[Food and Rayment]</hi> is commonly understood
to express the <hi>necessaries</hi> of man's Life. What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he urges hereupon <hi>(viz.</hi> that <hi>If Christ had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
Meat and Drink for the ONLY Gospel-main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
then the Apostles had been great Sinners
in receiving the price of Possessions sold and dedicated,</hi>
and that <hi>they must have returned them back again, as
must also St.</hi> Paul <hi>have done the wages he took of other
Churches, and those liberal presents he received from
the Philippians)</hi> is all grounded on a mistake that I
restrain the Gospel-maintenance to Meat and Drink
<hi>only,</hi> as if it were not lawful for a Gospel-Minister to
receive any thing but Meat and Drink <hi>only,</hi> though
<hi>never so freely offered by such as receive his Ministry,
and reap the benefit of it.</hi> Whereas he that shall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
read what I have there written, and not
strain my words to a Construction which the scope
and drift of them cannot fairly bear, may clearly see,
that I do not strictly tye the Maintenance to Meat
and Drink <hi>only,</hi> since I there qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>te and apply the
words of the Apostle, <hi>Having Food and Rayment</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:65611:66"/>
(which is more then Meat and Drink only) <hi>let us
therewith be content.</hi> Besides, the scope of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
in that place was not to shew what <hi>freedom</hi>
a Gospel-Minister may have, or how far it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
him <hi>to use</hi> that libe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty, in receiving what is
<hi>freely</hi> and voluntarily given by <hi>those that own</hi> and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
his Message: but what he may justly look for,
and expect to receive <hi>as his Right,</hi> and <hi>from whom.</hi>
Now we know there is a great difference between
expecting or looking for a thing as <hi>a just due,</hi> and
receiving or accepting a thing as <hi>a free gift</hi> or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence:
Which distinction the Priest not observing,
hath argued thus loosly and at random, urging the
<hi>free Gifts</hi> and <hi>voluntary Presents</hi> made to the Apostle
by some Churches whom he had Planted, Watered,
and bestowed <hi>much of his labour</hi> upon, as Examples
and Presidents for himself and his Brethren of the
Clergy to demand, require, <hi>exact,</hi> extort and <hi>by
force</hi> take from People now their Goods and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
not only <hi>against the Owners will,</hi> but even
from such as they have neither Planted, Watered,
nor Laboured for; such as <hi>receive not, nor own</hi> their
Ministry.</p>
            <p>Here the other Priest in his Vindication, pag. 301.
hath a particular Crochet, from my saying, What
this Gospel-Maintenance is, is expresly set down by
Christ himself, when he said to his Disciples, <hi>Eat such
things as are set before you. Eat and Drink such
things as they give<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp;c. he infers, <hi>According to this
Rule Tythes are a Gospel-maintenance, which have
been expresly set before us, expresly given us.</hi> A pretty
quirk! Because those things which were <hi>freely,</hi> chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
&amp; <hi>without any constraint,</hi> set before the Apostles
or given to them, were the proper Maintenance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65611:66"/>
for them; therefore Tythes, which poor
men <hi>full sore agai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st their wills</hi> (as well as beyond
ther abilities) are <hi>compelled,</hi> by the three Corded
Whip of <hi>treble damages,</hi> to set out for the Priests,
is a Gospel-Maintenance also. Is it not a sign they
have an ill cause to mannage, who are fain to make
use of such pittiful shifts as these? But if he can satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
himself that Tythes are a Gospel-Maintenance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
set before them, (although they who so set
them are <hi>constrained thereto)</hi> yet what will he say to
the case of those <hi>others,</hi> who preferring their <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
freedom</hi> before outward Liberty, and an <hi>unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed
Conscience</hi> before all Worldly priviledges and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,
cannot by any terrors be induced to set the
Tythes before the Priests, or give it to them (as well
knowing that <hi>neither are those Priests the Ministers of
Christ, nor Tythes a Gospel-maintenance)</hi> but for their
faithful Testimony against them, have their Bodies
shut up in <hi>nasty</hi> Holes and <hi>stinking</hi> Dungeons, and
their Goods made Havock of by the Priests means,
and forcibly taken from them? Will he call this a
Gospel-maintenance also; <hi>Such a Maintenance may
please such a Ministry;</hi> but they who know the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
understand better, and cannot be so deluded.
But the Priest adds, That <hi>if Tythes were not</hi> Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedec's
<hi>due before such time as</hi> Abraham <hi>gave him
them; yet when they were so given him, they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all dispute, which</hi> (sayes he) <hi>will sufficiently make
good our Title to Tythes (could we lay no other claim
unto them) wherefore it was</hi> (sayes he) <hi>that I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
That if they were not due by a divine appointment,
yet are they now due by a voluntary dedication of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That those Tythes which <hi>Abraham</hi> gave <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec</hi>
were <hi>Melchizedec's</hi> after <hi>Abraham</hi> had given him
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:65611:67"/>
them, is indeed without dispute; but for the Priest
thence to infer, That that will sufficiently make good
their claim to Tythes, is an absurd and very irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Inference. Though that gift of <hi>Abraham's</hi> did
intitle <hi>Melchizedec</hi> to the things thereby given; yet
it did not entitle him to <hi>any thing else,</hi> either from
<hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>any other</hi> person. So that if the Priest
had any right to claim from <hi>Melchizedec,</hi> yet could
he not thereby extend his claim any further then to
<hi>those particular Spoils</hi> which <hi>Abraham</hi> gave <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedec.</hi>
For if <hi>Melchizedec</hi> himself could not by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of that Gift claim any thing else, much less then
can any other. And though the Priest finding <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolf's</hi>
Donation not so credible as he hoped it would
have been, would now make as if in his former words,
<hi>Confer.</hi> pag. 146. [viz. That if Tythes were not due
by a divine appointment, they are now due by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
dedication of them] he had reference to this
Gift of <hi>Abraham's,</hi> yet is it but a meer shift and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
for it is manifest that by the Civil Powers and
Nursing Fathers of the Church, he had direct rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> and others who lived near his time.
But men who account their Tongues their own, will
take the liberty to say any thing.</p>
            <p>§. 5. <hi>In his 11th</hi> Section, <hi>he undertakes to shew,</hi>
That our Lord Iesus and his Apostles have sufficiently
established Tythes for the Maintenance of the Gospel-Ministers;
and that they may be proved also out of the
New Testament to be due <hi>Jure divino, pag.</hi> 61.</p>
            <p>This indeed is somewhat to the purpose. If he
prove this, the Controversie is ended. But if he has
no better Evidence to prove Tythes due <hi>jure divino
under the Gospel,</hi> then he has offered to prove them
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:65611:67"/>
so due <hi>before the</hi> Levetical <hi>Law,</hi> he will fall very
much short of his undertaking. Let us see however
what he has to offer in this place, where his greatest
strength may be expected.</p>
            <p>His first <hi>medium</hi> to prove that our Lord Jesus and
his Apostles have sufficiently established Tythes for
the Maintenance of the Gospel-Ministers, is this,
That <hi>there is no Repeal of Tythes in all the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is no more then he hath said before <hi>over and
over,</hi> and which I have already discovered the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
&amp; emptiness of, having plainly shewed, that there
was no necessity of an <hi>express</hi> Repeal of Tythes by
name, either in relation to the Claim made to them
from a pretended Right before the Law, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Right not being grounded upon an <hi>express</hi>
Command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or with respect to the Assignation of
them to the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priest-hood by the <hi>Levitical</hi>
Law, that Assignation being but <hi>temporary,</hi> and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the continuance of that Priest-hood, <hi>made</hi>
(as this Priest sayes expresly, pag. 51.) <hi>to the Priests for
the time being;</hi> and so to expire in course with that
Priest-hood. And yet, to put the matter out of all
doubt that Tythes are ended with that Priest-hood
where the Apostle mentions the change of the Priest-hood,
in the very same place he affirms, that <hi>the Law
is changed also,</hi> which he argues as a necessary Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
from the change of the Priest-hood. <hi>For the
Priest-hood being changed</hi> (sayes he, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 12.)
<hi>there is made of necessity a change also of the Law.</hi> And
that he speaks there with relation to the Law of
Tythes, as well as the other parts of the <hi>Levitical</hi>
Law, is most clear from Ver. 5. where he saith, <hi>And
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>erily they that are of the Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>who receive
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65611:68"/>
the Office of the Priest-hood, have a Commandment to
take the Tythes of the People according to the La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi>
&amp;c. But now, the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> being discharged
from the Office of the Priest-hood, and that Priest-hood,
which stood in that Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> being
changed, that Law also is changed, according to
which those Sons of <hi>Levi,</hi> who executed the Office
of that Priest-hood, had a Commandment to take
Tythes of the People. I appeal to every judicious
Reader, whether this be not the free and natural sense
of the Apostles words. And may not this be called
<hi>A Repeal of Tythes?</hi> Then neither may the other be
called a Repeal of the Priest-hood: for neither here,
nor elsewhere, that I remember, is it said in so many
Syllables, <hi>The Priest-hood is repealed.</hi> Yet as there
is enough said here, to warrant a Conclusion that
<hi>the Priest-hood is ended,</hi> though the word <hi>[Repeal]</hi>
be not used; so is there in like manner enough said
here, to warrant a Conclusion that <hi>Tythes are ended</hi>
also, though the word <hi>[Repeal]</hi> is not used.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds under this Head, That</hi> Our Saviour did
not revoke Tythes, so far as they were Moral, and a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
provision for his Ministers; so far as they were
founded on the Law of Nature, and Primitive Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
and grounded on an eternal Reason, <hi>pag.</hi> 62.</p>
            <p>All this is but a <hi>new begging</hi> of the <hi>old Question.</hi> I
deny that Tythes were <hi>Moral,</hi> founded on the Law
of <hi>Nature,</hi> or grounded on an <hi>eternal</hi> Reason. This
is true of Maintenance in general, but it is not true
of the <hi>Modes</hi> and <hi>Circumstances</hi> of Maintenance,
whereof Tythe is one. For Tythe (as I have said
before) is a <hi>mode</hi> or way of raising Maintenance, a
<hi>Circumstance</hi> of the <hi>quantity</hi> or proportion of Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
And though it be a dictate of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65611:68"/>
and eternal Reason that there should be a Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
that <hi>the Labourer should be rewarded;</hi> yet
doth not the Law of Nature prescribe the <hi>certain
quantity</hi> or proportion of Maintenance, nor the <hi>way</hi>
or <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ans</hi> by which it must be raised. These depend
not on an eternal, but on a <hi>temporal</hi> Reason, <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>
according to the diversity of times, places and
occasions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds further,</hi> If Tythes had been the only thing
of this kind to be abolished, it seems necessary there should
have been an express Revocation of them, which we are

            </p>
            <p>Tythes were not the <hi>only</hi> thing of this kind to be
abolished: for <hi>all the other Ceremonies</hi> of the Law
were abolished as well as Tythes; and yet, as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
as it seems to him, he shall not find an <hi>express</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of the <hi>one half</hi> of them. Will he thence
infer that they are not all revoked, or that those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
still in force, of which there is not an <hi>express</hi>
Revocation! He understands better I hope. But if
he will admit <hi>other Ceremonies</hi> of the Law to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished;
notwithstanding there appears no <hi>express</hi>
Revocation of them, he cannot with Reason insist
that Tythes are therefore not abolished, because no
<hi>express</hi> Revocation of them appears. But how
strangely <hi>partial</hi> is he, and <hi>misguided</hi> by a <hi>selfish</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
who would have Tythes due <hi>without an express
Command,</hi> but will not allow them to be ended with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an express revocation! His Rule, <hi>expressa nocent
non expressa non nocent,</hi> is so far from confirming him,
that it utterly overthrows his Cause, and rases the
conjectural and suppository Foundation of a Right to
Tythes before the Law. For there's his <hi>Non expressa</hi>

            <p>

the Question</hi> he can do nothing. But why should
we reasonably believe Jesus intended Tythes should
remain of Divine Right? Because <hi>he took away the</hi>
Law, by which they were due, and <hi>the Priest-hood</hi> to
which they were due? Were these arguments of his
intention that <hi>Tythes</hi> should remain! With much
more reason may we believe that Jesus intended <hi>they
should not remain,</hi> seeing he (who knew as well as
this Priest, that <hi>the Assignation</hi> of them <hi>was made
but to the Priests for the time being;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
without a new Institution, they would be void
in course at the dissolution of that Priest-hood) did
not think fit, either by himself or his Apostles, to
give so much as an <hi>intimation,</hi> either by word or
practice, that <hi>Tythes</hi> should remain for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of Gospel Ministers. Had Christ intended a
continuance of Tythes, it is not to be doubted but
he would have signified his intention. But seeing
<hi>no such thing is exprest,</hi> the <hi>Priest</hi> must remember
his own <hi>Axiom [non expressa non nocent.</hi> i. e. things
not exprest, do not hurt] and be content.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:65611:69"/>§. 6. Thus I have gone through the several parts
of his <hi>first Medium,</hi> in which there is <hi>no strength at
all</hi> to prove his Position, that our Lord Je<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us and
his Apostles have sufficiently established Tythes for
the Maintenance of the Gospel Ministers. I come
now to his second, which runs thus, <hi>But this is not
all, for there are positive Laws which do fairly intimate,
that Tythes were to be the Maintenance of the
Gospel Ministers, when the Church was settled,</hi>
page 62.</p>
            <p>'Twas well what he said before was not all, for if
it had, he had as good have said nothing. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I somewhat Question whether what he sayes
now will be much more to the purpose. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

            <p>
               <hi>Are intimations the proper Results of positive Laws?</hi>
If the Laws are <hi>positive,</hi> methinks they should declare
<hi>positively,</hi> not only <hi>hint</hi> things by <hi>intimation.</hi> But
waving that, (and his other less positive proofs, such
as our Saviour's affirming, Tythes ought to be paid,
in the Time of the Law, when all men grant they
were due, <hi>&amp;c. which,</hi> he sayes, <hi>plead only a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability,</hi>
and which I deny to plead <hi>so much</hi> as a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility)
I hasten after him to those two <hi>plain</hi> places
(as he calls them) which I take to be the <hi>positive</hi> Laws
mentioned before, which, he sayes, do fairly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
that <hi>Tythes</hi> were to be the <hi>maintenance</hi> of the
Gospel Ministers, when the Church was settled.
The <hi>first</hi> of these two plain places, is <hi>That</hi> (he sayes)
<hi>of St.</hi> Paul, 1 Cor. 9. 14. affirming, <hi>That like as the</hi>

good things which should be dedicated and offered in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
for the Gospel,</hi> p. 63.</p>
            <p>How hard is this poor man put to it, to piece
up something that might look a little like a proof.
This is at least the <hi>third</hi> time, that he has been driven
to his <hi>[Even so]</hi> and yet he is <hi>even</hi> at a loss still.
For supposing the partcle <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>[Even so]</hi> as it is, what can be thence infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?
That Gospel Ministers should live of the Gospel
<hi>Even so,</hi> as the <hi>Iewish Priests</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> lived of
the Tythes and Oblations under the Law? What,
<hi>just as they lived? exactly after the same manner?</hi>
Why then the Ministers of the Gospel should <hi>not
have the Tythes,</hi> but the Tythes of the Tythes, that
is, but the <hi>hundredth part;</hi> for <hi>even so</hi> the <hi>Iewish Priests</hi>
bad, the <hi>Levites</hi> had the Tythes, and paid this <hi>hundredth</hi>
part, or Tythe of Tythe to the Priests, and the rest of
the Priest Maintenance was made up by Oblations. So
that if the Priests now will needs as Gospel Ministers
be maintained, and live <hi>even just so</hi> as the <hi>Iewish</hi> Priests
lived, they must introduce the <hi>Iewish Oblation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the <hi>Burnt-Offerings</hi> and <hi>Bloody Sacrifices,</hi> as in the time
of the Law, and so <hi>deny the one Offering,</hi> and become
<hi>Debters to the whole Law.</hi> This looks strangely; and
yet I see not how it can be avoided, if they will strain
the Particle <hi>[Even]</hi> to an <hi>exact parity</hi> of Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
between <hi>Iewish</hi> Priests and Gospel Ministers,
and if they do not strain it to such a parity, they
cannot <hi>squcese</hi> Tythes out of it; for then they that
preach the Gospel may <hi>live of the Gospel,</hi> as well as
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Priests and <hi>Levites</hi> lived of the things of
the Temple, and of the Altar, and yet not by <hi>Tythes.</hi>

               </gap>
enough from proving it must be Tythes: for this
shews the Maintenance was to be what Believers
were willing <hi>freely to give,</hi> which might as well be
a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as a Tenth, according as their ability would permit,
or the occasion should require. And if it were in the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e what part to give, that leaves no
place for a Divine Right to Tythes. Thus then we see
this <hi>first</hi> of his <hi>plain</hi> places, and <hi>positive</hi> Laws, is so
far from affording a <hi>positive</hi> proof that Tythes were
to be the Maintenance of the Gospel Ministers, that
it doth not so much as <hi>fairly intimate</hi> it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to help out the matter he adds pag. 64. That</hi>
the blessed Iesus who ordained this, did incline the
hearts of pious <hi>Christians</hi> to dedicate Tythes and other
Oblations made in gratitude for the Gospel.</p>
            <p>This I shall have occasion to take further notice of,
when I shall come anon to examine his Dedications,
Donations and Charters. In this place let it susfice,
that what he takes for granted, <hi>I deny,</hi> and expect

Oblations and Dedications have been made, under

thereto.</p>

will be given, and this en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>other expresses <hi>what part.</hi>
What proof then can either of these places afford
that Tythes, or the <hi>tenth</hi> part, was to be the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of the Gospel Ministers, and that our Lord
Jesus and his Apostles have sufficiently established
Tythes for the Maintenance of the Gospel Ministers,
whenas neither of these places mention <hi>Tythes</hi> or any
<hi>certain</hi> quantity! He that is <hi>taught</hi> in the word is to
Communicate unto him that <hi>teacheth</hi> in <hi>all good things.</hi>
That he doth as really, though not <hi>so largely,</hi> who
giveth but an hundredth part, as he that giveth a
tenth. And on the other hand, if he that is to be
the <hi>receiver</hi> may take the liberty of fixing the <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi>
he may if he please, make it a <hi>third</hi> part or a
<hi>half,</hi> as well as a tenth. We see then no <hi>certain
Conclusion</hi> can be drawn from these Texts as to the
<hi>proportion</hi> or <hi>quantity</hi> of Maintenance, that being
left <hi>wholly free,</hi> and at the disposal of the Giver.
Consequently <hi>Tythes,</hi> which are a certain quantity
<hi>cannot be proved by these Scriptures to be established by
our Lord Iesus and his Apostles for the Maintenance
of the Gospel Ministers.</hi> Thus these two <hi>plain</hi> places
and <hi>positive</hi> Laws (as the Priest calls them) are plain
and positive enough <hi>against him and his Brethren,</hi> to
prove, that <hi>they ought not to exact Maintenance from
those that deny their Ministry:</hi> but will not prove
what he would have, <hi>viz.</hi> Tythes for the Gospel
Maintenance, either <hi>positively,</hi> or by <hi>fair inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>If there were no other Objection but this, yet
this is such an one as he can never be able to remove.
A grand Objection indeed, st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ongely inforced against
himself by the Maxim urged by himself, (pag. 62.)
<hi>Non expressa non nocent,</hi> Those things which are not
exprest do not hurt This shuts out all his Conjectures,
and Suppositions, and restrains him closely to what is
exprest. But seeing (by his own confession, pag.
67.) Tythes are not exprest, not mentioned in the
New-Testament to be the Gospel-Maintenance, how
rash and over-confident was he in the entrance of
his 11th <hi>Section</hi> to assert (pag. 61) That our Lord
Jesus and his Apostles have sufficiently established
Tythes for the Maintenance of the <hi>Gospel-Ministers,</hi>
and that they may be proved also out of the New-Testament
to be due, <hi>jure divino!</hi> Will he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to prove that out of the New-Testament, which
he confesses is not mentioned in the New-Testament,
and yet at the same time tell us, <hi>Non expressa non
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:65611:72"/>
nocent!</hi> What man of reason, modesty or name
would not be ashamed of this! But besides this which
he hath brought, there are other Objections against
Tythes being the Maintenance of Gospel-Ministers,
namely, That Tythes or a tenth part is a <hi>Ceremony,</hi>
Mode, or Circumstance of Maintenance, and as such
was a part of the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law, which being
abrogated by Christ, was not fit to be received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<hi>Christians;</hi> That a Maintenance by Tythes,
or any other certain, fixed and determinate quantity,
is not agreeable with the Nature of the <hi>Gospel,</hi>
which as it self is <hi>free,</hi> so ought the Maintenance also
to be; this being one of the Believers <hi>Priviledges</hi>
under the <hi>Gospel:</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> was a State of <hi>Bondage;</hi>
the <hi>Gospel</hi> is a State of <hi>Liberty.</hi> The Law represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the condition of <hi>Servants;</hi> the Gospel that of
<hi>Sons.</hi> The Law treated those that were under it, as
Children in <hi>Nonage</hi> under Tutors and Governours;
the Gospel treats them that receive it, as men arr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to an <hi>adult</hi> age. Besides, under the Gospel,
Tythes are not an <hi>equal</hi> way of Maintenance, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
either of the <hi>Giver,</hi> or of the <hi>Receiver,</hi> or of
the <hi>Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many other Objections might also be urged
against Tythes being a <hi>Gospel-Maintenance,</hi> but these
may serve to convince the Priest, that he was <hi>too hasty</hi>
in concluding there is but <hi>this one</hi> Objection which he
has brought. But leaving these, at least at present,
let us see how he attempts to remove that one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
which himself has urged, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Tythes
are not mentioned in the Gospel or Epistles to be the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
part.</hi> To this, sayes he, I reply, <hi>There are very good
Reasons why Tythes are not mentioned in the New-Testament,
by name;</hi> His first reason is, <hi>To avoid all
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:65611:72"/>
occasion of scandal to the</hi> Jews, <hi>whose Priests were then in
Possession of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is no weight at all in this reason; for we see that
in that very Epistle which was written to the <hi>Hebrew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
or <hi>Iews</hi> themselves, the Apostle tells them expresly
(and argues it forcibly and undeniably) that the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Priest-hood, and the Law by which they took Tythes,
together with that Covenant, and the whole <hi>Iewish</hi>
Polity, were abrogated and ended by Christ. And
he that had written all this so <hi>Plain,</hi> so <hi>Full,</hi> so
<hi>Home,</hi> needed he avoid mentioning Tythes as a Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Maintenance,
<hi>for fear of giving Offence</hi> to the <hi>Iews!</hi>
What can be more irrational! What could have been
said more Offensive to the <hi>Iews</hi> then he in that Epistle
writ! Besides, whatsoever was written by the
Evangelists or Apostles, whether it were Historical
or Epistolary, it was written for, and dedicated to
the Believers in Christ Jesus; not to Unconverted
<hi>Iews,</hi> but to those who were turned from <hi>Iudais<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
to the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith; which whosoever truly was,
must needs be brought from off the <hi>Iewish</hi> Priests,
and see the end of that <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> by the Springing
up of a New one. It cannot then with Reason be
supposed, that they who believed the <hi>Iewish</hi> Priest-hood
ended, and Consequently that Tythes were no
longer due unto it, would in zeal to that Priest-hood
have taken Offence at the mentioning of Tythes for
a Gospel-Maintenance, or that the holy Pen-men did
for that Reason omit the mention of them. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
If it might with any shew of Reason be allowed
that in not mentioning Tythes as a Gospel-Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
Regard was had to the <hi>Iews:</hi> Yet what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
at all could this Reason have to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom the far greater part of the Epistles were
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:65611:73"/>
written? Will he supose the <hi>Gentiles</hi> would have
been Offended at the Trasferring of Tythes from the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Priests to the Gospel-Ministers? That indeed
may well be supposed; but not upon the score on
which he grounds his Reason. They might justly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
have been scandaliz'd, had the <hi>Iewish Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
Maintenance</hi> by Tythes been introduced among
<hi>Christians;</hi> but not out of any love or zeal for the
<hi>Iewish</hi> Priests, of whom they had not so great esteem,
and to whom they bear not so much good Will.
Neither is this all, but the emptiness and lightness of
this Reason will more fully yet appear to him that
shall consider, that some of the Apostles lived to see
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Priests <hi>actually dispossest</hi> of Tythes, and
that Nation dispersed and scattered, the Synagogue
not only <hi>dead,</hi> but <hi>buried,</hi> and the whole <hi>Iewish</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<hi>destroyed,</hi> and yet after all this, <hi>no claim</hi> put in
to Tythes, <hi>no exortation</hi> to pay them, <hi>no mention</hi> of
them as a Gospel-Maintenance. If therefore one
should suppose the Apostles forbore to claim Tythes
as the Gospel-Maintenance, while the <hi>Iewish Priests</hi>
were possest of them, and that Polity had yet some
shew of standing, in <hi>condescention to the</hi> Jews, and
to avoid all occasion of scandal to <hi>them;</hi> yet surely
he must abandon all Reason, and utterly renounce
his Understanding, that can believe they forbore
upon this Reason to claim Tythes <hi>afterwards</hi> also,
when they had seen the <hi>Temple raised to the Ground,
the</hi> Jewish <hi>Priests</hi> actually dispossessed, and that whole
Polity <hi>totally subverted.</hi> If Tythes had been intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the Gospel <hi>Ministers</hi> Maintenance, and in
tenderness to the <hi>Iews,</hi> (as he fancies) had <hi>been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
a while to run in their old Channel, till the whole</hi>
Jewish <hi>Polity had been D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stroyed,</hi> yet what shew of
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:65611:73"/>
Reason can be given, why those Apostles that lived
to see the whole <hi>Iewish</hi> Polity Destroyed, did not
then turn Tythes into their <hi>New</hi> and proper Channel,
and <hi>expresly</hi> declare, That Tythes were the <hi>Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi>
established by Christ for the Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His second Reason why Tythes are not mentioned
in the New Testament to be the Maintenance of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Ministers is this,</hi> There was not any need for Iesus
to make any new Law for Tythes, since they were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
declared to be due to God before, by Revelation,
and Example, by Reason and God's own choice; by
the grounds on which they were given, and the ends for
which they were imployed, <hi>pag.</hi> 68.</p>
            <p>If his Particle <hi>[before]</hi> refers to his <hi>second</hi> Period,
the time of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, he then speaks to <hi>no
purpose at all,</hi> that Law being <hi>ended,</hi> and any Title
thereby <hi>disclaim'd</hi> by the present Clergy. And if it
relate to his <hi>first</hi> Period, the time <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
Law, I have then already refuted this Reason of
his <hi>over and over;</hi> and doubtless were he not at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
great strait, he would not thus <hi>nauseat</hi> his Reader
with <hi>Tautologies.</hi> That Tythes were due to God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, and sufficiently declared so
to be by Revelation, Example, Reason, &amp;c. he has
<hi>beg'd</hi> a Concession of <hi>beyond all degrees of Modesty,</hi> but
not offer'd <hi>one</hi> solid Reason to prove. Of the ground
on which they were given, and the end for which they
were imployed before the Law, there is nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,
and he knows who said, <hi>Non expressa non no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
i. e.</hi> Things not exprest, hurt not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His third Reason why Tythes are not mentioned
in the New Testament to be the Maintenance of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Ministers is, Because</hi> the devotion of the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:65611:74"/>
in those dayes was so great, that they gave more then
a tenth freely, Selling all and following Christ, and
bestowing on the Apostles more then they were in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to receive, <hi>pag.</hi> 69.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Christians</hi> in those dayes gave more then
a tenth, is <hi>more then he can prove.</hi> For though some
of them sold their Possessions, and laid the price there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
at the Apostles Feet, yet was not that <hi>given</hi> to the
Apostles for <hi>their proper</hi> use, but <hi>deposited</hi> as in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
stock or treasury, for the <hi>common</hi> supply and
maintenance of <hi>them all,</hi> while they lived together in
that Community, which was not long. But what
part soever it was that they gave, it is enough for my
purpose that it was a <hi>Gift,</hi> a <hi>free Gift.</hi> And if our
Lord Jesus did not think fit to make any <hi>new determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of the tenth part by Name, pag. 69. after
that the <hi>old determination</hi> thereof under the Law was
<hi>determined</hi> and ended by hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Death; but committed his
Ministers to the <hi>Christians devotion</hi> for Maintenance,
how comes this Priest so confidently to affirm, pag. 61.
That <hi>our Lord Iesus and his Apostles have sufficiently
established Tythes for the Maintenance of the Gospel
Ministers?</hi> How strangely doth he <hi>contradict</hi> himself
herein, when in one place he is <hi>positive</hi> that <hi>our Lord
Iesus and his Apostles have sufficiently established Tythes
for the Maintenance of the Gospel Ministers,</hi> pag. 61.
in the other as <hi>express,</hi> That <hi>our Lord and his Apostles
did not make a new determination of the tenth part by
name,</hi> pag 69. and urges Reasons to prove that they
neither did nor needed make any <hi>new Law</hi> for Tythes;
as first, <hi>The great devotion of</hi> Christians <hi>in those dayes,</hi>
pag. 69. Secondly, <hi>The expectation our Lord Iesus
might have, that the joyful Message of his Gospel should
be so thankfully received, that those to whom it was
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:65611:74"/>
sent, should do as much freely to the gratifying his Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers,
as the servile</hi> Jews <hi>did by the compulsion of a
positive Law,</hi> pag. 70. Thirdly, <hi>The fore-sight our
Lord Iesus had, that his Grace would open the Hearts
of Kings and Princes, and other devout persons to give
more then a tenth part of their good things, to those in
his Name and for his sake, who were sent to Preach
the Gospel.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>That since such times were
coming, our Lord might probably on purpose decline
determining the proportion too expresly, that</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
<hi>might have the opportunity of a voluntary Charity.</hi>
Fifthly, <hi>That this was more agreeable to the freedom
and ingenuity of Sons, which</hi> Christians <hi>are compared
to.</hi> Sixthly, <hi>That positive Laws were likely to be made
when the decayes of Piety and Charity did require them,</hi>
pag. 71. These are the Reasons he offers for proof
that <hi>our Lord Iesus and his Apostles did not make a new
determination of the tenth part by name,</hi> and that in the
very same Section, wherein he so confidently affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That <hi>our Lord Iesus and his Apostles have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
established Tythes for the Maintenance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Ministers.</hi> If they have established <hi>Tythes,</hi> they
have then established a <hi>tenth part by name;</hi> for <hi>Tythes</hi>
are denominated, or take their Name, from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<hi>Tenth. (Decimae a decimo)</hi> But that neither
Christ nor his Apostles have established a tenth part
by Name, and consequently have not established
Tythes for the Maintenance of the Gospel Ministers,
the Reasons before recited, which the Priest himself
hath given, do plainly enough prove. For besides
the <hi>great</hi> and prompt <hi>devotion of</hi> Christians <hi>in those
dayes, our Lord Iesus</hi> (he sayes) <hi>might expect that
the joyful Message of his Gospel should be so thankfully
received, that those to whom it was sent should do as
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:65611:75"/>
much freely to the gratifying his Messengers, as the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi>
Jews <hi>did by the compulsion of a positive Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then it seems our Lord Jesus did not think fit to
<hi>compel Christians</hi> by a positive Law <hi>to pay Tythes,</hi> but
left the gratifying his Messengers to that <hi>freedom,</hi>
which he foresaw <hi>his Grace would open their Hearts to:</hi>
for to maintain Christ's Ministers by the <hi>compulsion</hi> of
a positive Law, was (as the Priest rightly observes)
suitable to the <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rvile</hi> state of the <hi>Iews,</hi> which <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
who are compared to Son<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, ought not to be
<hi>subjected</hi> to, but le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t to the exercise of a <hi>voluntary</hi>
Charity, which is more agreeable to the <hi>freedom</hi> and
<hi>ingenuity</hi> of Sons. Therefore he sayes, <hi>Since such
times were coming, our Lord might probably on purpose
decline determining the proportion too expresly.</hi> In all
which he hath notably argued against himself, and
sufficiently proved that the Maintenance of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Ministry ought to be by <hi>free gift, voluntary Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
uncompelled,</hi> that the compulsion of positive Law
in this case, is a <hi>badge</hi> of <hi>Iewish servility</hi> not agreeable
to the Christian State, which stands in and acts from
the <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>ingenuity</hi> of Sons, and that therefore
<hi>our Lord Iesus and his Apostles did not make any new
Law for Tythes,</hi> did not make <hi>any new determination</hi>
of a tenth part by name, and that our Lord might
probably on purpose decline <hi>determining</hi> the <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
too expresly. But what now is become of his
first Assertion, That <hi>our Lord Iesus and his Apostles
have sufficiently established Tythes for the Maintenance
of the Gospel Ministers?</hi> Did Christ establish Tythes,
and yet on purpose decline determining the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
expresly? Is not Tythe or a tenth part an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
determination of the proportion? What mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st
contradiction has this over-hasty man run himself
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:65611:75"/>
into! Again, if (as he sayes, pag. 68) There was
no need for Jesus to make <hi>any new Law</hi> for Tythes. If
our Lord and his Apostles did not make <hi>a new determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
of a tenth part by name, pag. 69. If our Lord
might probably on purpose decline <hi>determining the
proportion</hi> too expresly, that <hi>Christians</hi> might have
the opportunity of a <hi>voluntary</hi> Charity, pag. 70. If
he expected they to whom his Gospel was sent, should
do as much <hi>freely</hi> to the gratifying his Messengers,
as the servile <hi>Iews</hi> did by the compulsion of a positive
Law. And if this <hi>free, gratuitous</hi> and <hi>voluntary</hi>
Charity was more agreeable to the <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity</hi>
of Sons, which <hi>Christians</hi> are compared to,
then the <hi>servile compulsion</hi> of a positive Law. And if
positive Laws were likely to be made when the decays
of Piety and Charity did require them, pag. 71.
which could not be in the Apostles dayes, when the
<hi>devotion</hi> of <hi>Christians</hi> was so <hi>great,</hi> that they gave
(as the Priest sayes) <hi>more then a tenth</hi> freely, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on the Apostles <hi>more</hi> then they were in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to receive, pag. 69. I say, if all this may serve

               </gap>rove that our Lord Jesus and his Apostles left the

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> Maintenance of the Gospel Ministers, when

but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>radiction and confusion?</p>
            <p>He has yet one Reason more why Tythes are
not mentioned in the New-Testament to be the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:65611:76"/>
of the Gospel-Ministers, and that is, That
<hi>the State of the Church in those dayes was such, that
Believers, though they were willing, could not have
opportunity to pay Tythes regularly; nor could the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Ministers
receive them,</hi> pag. 71.</p>
            <p>Had he assigned this for a <hi>general</hi> Reason, why
Tythes should not be paid at <hi>all</hi> under the Gospel,
he had said something to the purpose. But in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayning
his Reason to the State of the Church in
those dayes <hi>only,</hi> he falls short. Besides, how
knows he that Believers then were <hi>willing</hi> to have
paid, and Gospel Ministers to have received Tythes,
had opportunity served? I believe the contrary, and
have many Reasons inducing me thereunto; but
since he affirms it, let him prove it. However, if
Tythes (as he dreams) were to be the Maintenance
of the Gospel-Ministers, when the Church was set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled,
the want of opportunity for the paying and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
them regularly at that instant, could be no
good Reason why they were wholly passed over
in silence, and no mention made of them to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in all the New-Testament, unless he would sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
that all that was mentioned in the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
had Relation to the then present State of the
Church, and nothing to the future. But if some
things relating to the future State of the Church are
mentioned in the New-Testament, then surely
so might Tythes have been also, had they been intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for a Gospel Ministry's Maintenance, when the
Church was settled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds, That</hi> as it was no prejudice to the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Priests, that there was little or no Tythes paid, during
their Fore-Fathers wandring in the Wilderness; no
more is it to us, that they were not paid regularly in the
Times of Persecution, <hi>pag.</hi> 71.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:65611:76"/>
That could be no prejudice to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Priests, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Tythes were not due to them, or required to
be paid, till their wandring in the Wilderness was
over, and they settled in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and
an express command there was for the payment of
Tythes to them when they were so settled. But these
Priests can produce no Command for the payment of
Tythes to them either <hi>before</hi> the times of Persecution,
<hi>in</hi> those times, nor <hi>after</hi> them. It is not then a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment
of Tythes regularly in the times of Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
that prejudices these Priests: but that which
prejudices their Claim is, That <hi>Tythes were never du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
to them at all;</hi> they have no Command, nor ever had,
to claim Tythes by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet he sayes,</hi> Our Lord Iesus and the Apostles said
so much in the <hi>New-Testament,</hi> that the Primitive
<hi>Christians</hi> understood them to intend Tythes for the
Gospel-Maintenance, <hi>pag.</hi> 71.</p>
            <p>How knows he this, seeing the Scripture is silent
of it? Had the Primitive <hi>Christians</hi> understood
Tythes to be intended by Christ for the Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of his Ministers, no doubt they would have
<hi>paid</hi> them: for they knew full well that Saying of our
Lord, <hi>He that knows his Masters Will, and doth it not,
shall be beaten with many stripes.</hi> Their non-payment
of Tythes, therefore is a sufficient Argument that
they did <hi>not</hi> understand Tythes to be appointed by
Christ for the Maintenance of his Ministers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds,</hi> That they <hi>(to wit our Lord Jesus and the
Apostles)</hi> said enough to shew, that the Ancient Divine
Right to the tenth part should be continued.</p>
            <p>I wish he had quoted his Text for this, that I might
have known whence he had it: for I have read the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65611:77"/>
New-Testament more then once, and yet I Solemnly
profess, I never read this there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But sayes he, pag. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> It was neither necessary,
nor convenient they should speak more plainly in this
matter: This being sufficient to establish the Divine
Right of Tythes under the Gospel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This!</hi> Which? What means he here by <hi>This?</hi>
Did the <hi>not mentioning</hi> Tythes at all in the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for a Gospel Maintenance, <hi>establish</hi> (thinks he)
the Divine Right of Tythes under the Gospel? Or
did our Lord and his Apostles <hi>not</hi> making a new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the tenth part by name, do this? Or
did his <hi>purposely declining</hi> to determine the proportion
too expresly? Or what else may we suppose his
<hi>[This]</hi> can relate to, which may be thought suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to establish the Divine Right of Tythes under
the Gospel. Certainly either he is very <hi>Dark,</hi> or
I am very <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ll:</hi> for in good earnest, I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
what to refer his Particle <hi>[This]</hi> unto. But
whatever it is, I perceive he would have it sufficient,
not only to <hi>establish a Divine Right of Tythes under
the Gospel,</hi> but also, <hi>to teach us that Tythes being O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
due to God, and by Christ assigned to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-Ministers,
are now due to them,</hi> jure divino,
pag. 72.</p>
            <p>This is much to the same purpose, as if he should
have said that Tythes <hi>being due,</hi> jure divino, <hi>are due,</hi>
jure divino. If ever <hi>Popery</hi> should prevail here, and
this man turn <hi>Fryar,</hi> 'tis fit he should be of the
<hi>Mendicant</hi> Order, he is so ready at <hi>begging.</hi> Two
Questions has he <hi>very confidently</hi> begged in these two
Lines. First, <hi>That Tythes are Originally due to God,</hi>
which that they are as Tythes, as a tenth part distinct
from the other nine, or more peculiarly then the rest,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:65611:77"/>
I have before more then once denied and dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
Secondly, <hi>That Christ hath assigned Ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>es to
the Gospel-Ministers.</hi> Hath he so? and yet Tythes
not mentioned in the Gospel or Epistles to be the
very part, p. 07. Tythes not mentioned in the New-Testament,
by name, <hi>ibid.</hi> That methinks is strange.
What! an Assignation ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ded, wherein the thing
pretended to be assigned, is not so much as <hi>named,</hi>
nor the certain <hi>quantity</hi> described! Who ever heard
of such an Assignation before? But how doth it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
there is such an assignation? for we have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
but his bare word for it. Before, when he
spake of the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priest-hood's Right to Tythes
(of which no Body doubted) he was very forward
to produce an express assignation, and a Text
withal to attest it. But now, when he speaks of the
Gospel-Ministers Right to Tythes, (which needs the
clearest proof, and plainest demonstration) his assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and evidence are both to seek. Is this to shew
that our Lord Jesus and his Apostles have <hi>sufficiently
established</hi> Tythes for the Maintenance of the Gospel-Ministers?
Is this to shew that Tythes <hi>may be proved</hi>
out of the New-Testament to be due, <hi>jure divino?</hi>
pag. 61. Is this to prove the Divine Right of Tythes
<hi>sufficiently established</hi> under the Gospel, (pag. 72.)
to say that Tythes <hi>being originally due</hi> to God, and
<hi>by Christ assigned</hi> to the Gospel-Ministers, are now
due to them, <hi>jure divino?</hi> Can any one doubt but
that <hi>if</hi> Tythes were <hi>indeed</hi> assigned to the Ministers
of the Gospel, they were then unquestionably due to
them <hi>jure divino?</hi> Or can it be imagined, that I or
any man else would <hi>grant</hi> the <hi>first</hi> of these, and <hi>deny</hi>
the <hi>latter</hi> Was the Question wheth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>If Christ had

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:65611:78"/>
thereby have been due to them?</hi> Or was it not, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Christ had indeed assigned Tythes to the Gospel-Ministers
or no?</hi> This belonged to him to prove;
and does he think to carry it without proof, by a <hi>sly
supposing</hi> it? He deceives himself. He sayes of me,

what <hi>sort</hi> of Readers he hoped to meet with, or
what <hi>scantling of Vnderstanding</hi> (as his phrase
is) he suited his Discourse to, when he said, <hi>Tythes
being Originally due to God, and by Christ assigned to
the Gospel-Ministers, are now due to them,</hi> jure
divino! Did he hope to perswade his Reader by <hi>beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi>
instead of <hi>proving,</hi> and by taking that for <hi>grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
which indeed the <hi>main</hi> Question in Controversie,
and which requires the <hi>most evident</hi> Demonstration?
He might perhaps by this means <hi>gull</hi> some hasty heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Reader; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en of Sence and Understanding
are not satisfied with such put-off's. <hi>Fair Words</hi> may
please Fools, but Wise men look for <hi>fair Proofs.</hi>
Would he think I dealt fairly with him, if I should
say, that <hi>he being a Deceiver is not a Minister of Christ?</hi>
The <hi>Conclusion</hi> is true, if it be drawn from a true
<hi>Proposition.</hi> It is clear enough, that he is not a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Christ, if he be a Deceiver; but whether he
be a Deceiver or no, is the Question, on the proof
of which, the Truth of the <hi>Conclusion</hi> depends.
Now if <hi>instead of proving</hi> this Proposition [That <hi>he
is a Deceiver]</hi> I should <hi>take it for granted,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
more ado infer from thence, that <hi>he is no Minister
of Christ,</hi> I should do by him just as he has done by
his Reader. He sayes, <hi>Tythes being by Christ assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Gospel-Ministers, are now due to them by
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:65611:78"/>
Divine Right.</hi> The <hi>Conclusion</hi> here is undoubtedly
true, if the <hi>Proposition</hi> be true from which it is
drawn. No man in his wits will deny, that Tythes
are due to Gospel Ministers, if Christ have assigned
Tythes to them: But that's the Question in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie;
that's the <hi>Proposition</hi> to be proved, on
the proof of which the Truth of the <hi>Conclusion</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.
Now <hi>instead of proving</hi> this Proposition [That
Christ hath assigned Tythes to the Gospel-Ministers]
he <hi>takes it for granted,</hi> and with no more ado infers
from thence, that Tythes are now due to Gospel-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,
<hi>jure divino. Is this like a Disputant?</hi> Doth
this become a man of his <hi>high pretences</hi> to Schollar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Learning? Let the intelligent Reader judge.</p>
            <p>§. 7. I am now come to the end of his 11th <hi>Section,</hi>
in which he undertook to shew, That our Lord Jesus
and his Apostles have sufficiently established Tythes
for the Maintenance of the Gospel Ministers; and
that they may be proved out of the New-Testament to
be due, <hi>jure divino.</hi> Before I proceed to his next
Section, I desire the Reader to observe, <hi>First,</hi> that
my Opponent hath <hi>faln so far short</hi> of proving the
establishment of Tythes by Christ and his Apostles
for the Maintenance of <hi>Gospel-Ministers,</hi> that
he hath <hi>plainly acknowledged</hi> Tythes are <hi>not so much</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               <hi>named</hi> in the New-Testament, pag. 67. (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they are not, with relation to Gospel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters)
<hi>Secondly,</hi> That though he sayes, there are <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Laws,</hi> pag. 62. yet he dares not say, those
Laws speak <hi>positively,</hi> but only that they do <hi>fairly
intimate</hi> that Tythes were to be the Maintenance of
the Gospel-Ministers, pag. 63. And to take off
the force of his <hi>positive</hi> Laws more fully, and shew
how little <hi>positive</hi> they were with respect to Tythes,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:65611:79"/>
he himself proves at large, that <hi>Iesus did not make
any new Law for Tythes,</hi> pag. 68, 69. and gives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
others, this Reason for it, That <hi>Iesus might
expect his Messengers should be gratified freely.</hi> Nay,
so eager he is to shew why Jesus made no new Law
for Tythes, that no considering how destructive it
would prove to his former talk of <hi>positive</hi> Laws,
pag. 62, 63, 64. he fairly argues the <hi>compulsion</hi> of a
<hi>positive</hi> Law to be <hi>Iewish</hi> and <hi>Servile;</hi> and <hi>voluntary
charity</hi> to be more <hi>ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. make <hi>no mention at all</hi> of <hi>Tythes</hi>
or any <hi>certain</hi> part. They shew that <hi>some Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance</hi>
is due, they shew <hi>to whom</hi> it is due, and
<hi>from whom,</hi> but they shew not <hi>the quantity</hi> of that
Maintenance, and Consequently, do <hi>not prove Tythes</hi>
to be it. Besides, he sayes, pag. 69. <hi>Our Lord
and his Apostles did not make a new Determination of
the tenth part by name;</hi> and pag. 70. <hi>Our Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

probably on purpose decline determining the proportion
too expresly,</hi> &amp;c. Now Tythes being an <hi>express De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the tenth part by name,</hi> it is evident even
from his own Positions, that Tythes or a tenth part
was <hi>not Determined by our Lord</hi> and his Apostles, to
be the Maintenance of Gospel Ministers. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
That although my Opponent begins this Section
with a great deal of confidence, and <hi>seeming</hi> Resol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
undertaking to shew, that <hi>our Lord Iesus and
his Apostles have sufficiently established Tythes for the
Maintenance of the Gospel Ministers, and that they
may be proved out of the New-Testament to be due,</hi> jure
divino. Yet in the Prosecution of this Argument he
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:65611:79"/>
               <hi>flags</hi> and sinks; he is not <hi>positive</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
himself <hi>doubtfully</hi> and <hi>fearfully.</hi> (We may
reasonably <hi>believe,</hi> sayes he, <hi>that Iesus intended they
should remain of Divine Right,</hi> pag. 62.) and in the
close of the Section miserably <hi>begs the Question,</hi>
that Christ hath assigned Tythes to the Gospel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
and on that <hi>precarious</hi> bottom would set the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Right of Tythes. Thus far then we have gone,
and find <hi>no firm Foundation</hi> for a Divine Right to
Tythes under the Gospel. <hi>No Institution</hi> of them;
<hi>No New Determination</hi> of them; <hi>No Establishment</hi>
of them; <hi>No Mention</hi> of them in all the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as a <hi>Maintenance</hi> for Gospel-Ministers.</p>
            <p>Now Reader, in the close of this Section take the
Judgment of two eminent Divines (so called) of the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> and see how contrary this Priest
is to them. The first is <hi>Fulk</hi> in Q. <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time,
The other <hi>Willet</hi> in K. <hi>Iames</hi> his time. <hi>Fulk</hi> on <hi>Heb.</hi>
7. §. 4. having shewed that <hi>the payment of Tythes,
as it was a Ceremonial duty, is abrogated with other
Ceremonies by the death of Christ,</hi> and that <hi>any other
sufficient Stipend,</hi> whether it be <hi>more or less then a
tenth part,</hi> may be <hi>appointed</hi> as well as Tythes, adds,
<q>But that there is any Sacrificing Priest-hood, to
whom it (namely Tythes) is due in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the old payment of Tythes doth not prove.
Neither did Christ himself our high Priest, ever
make claim unto them: nor his Apostles the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of the Church, but only to a sufficient living by
the Gospel, to be allowed of their temporal Goods,
to whom they ministred spiritual Goods,</q> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.
14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. Thus he, by which we may see he
was far enough from thinking what this Priest affirms,
<hi>viz.</hi> That Christ and his Apostles have sufficiently
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65611:80"/>
established Tythes for the Maintenance of the Gospel
Ministers, and that they may be proved out of the
New Testament to be due <hi>jure divino,</hi> and that Christ
hath assigned Tythes to the Gospel Ministers, &amp;c.
seeing he sayes plainly both that the <hi>old Ceremonial</hi>
payment of them is <hi>abrogated,</hi> and <hi>no new claim</hi> made
either by Christ or his Apostles to Tythes, but <hi>only</hi> to
a sufficient living by the Gospel, and that too to be
allowed of <hi>their</hi> temporal Goods, to whom <hi>they</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
spiritual Goods. And he quotes the very
same Texts to prove the <hi>Apostles did not claim Tythes,</hi>
but only a sufficient Maintenance, which this Priest
has brought to prove, that that Maintenance ought
to be Tythes, namely, 1 <hi>Cor. 9. 14. Gal.</hi> 6. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Willet</hi> in his <hi>Synopsis</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> fifth general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
pag. 315. repeating a Canon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of <hi>Orleans,</hi> thus, <q>As it is in the will of the giver
to give what pleases him, so if he find him stubborn
and froward which receiveth it, it is in his power to
revoke the gift; sayes thereupon,</q> 
               <q>We see then
that the Word of God hath laid <hi>no such necessity</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Tythes, for then this Council would not have
permitted such Liberty.</q> And a little after, setting
down the fifteenth Article of the <hi>Bohemians</hi> against
Tythes, he adds, <q>Therefore <hi>Tythes are not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
due by the Word of God.</hi> And a few lines lower,
This (sayes he) may further appear by the practice
of other Churches, that the payment of Tythes
(though of all other most fit) is not imposed as a
necessary Law.</q> Then instancing several Churches
other wayes maintained, he adds, <q>I alledge not
the practice of these Churches, as allowing the same
(for I prefer the condition of those Churches, which
yet do enjoy the antient provision of the Ministry
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65611:80"/>
by Tythes) but only to shew, that <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Tything is not imposed by any necessity.</hi>
               </q> And speaking
of <hi>Melchizede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'s</hi> Priest-stood, he sayes, <q>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seeing <hi>Melchizedec's</hi> Priest-hood only resteth
in Christ, and is not translated to any other, and
that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>5. it follows
that by reason of any such external Priest-hood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r
Sacrifice, <hi>Tythes are not now due</hi> unto the Church,
neither in any such regard ought to be challenged.</q>
Again, pag. 316. <q>If there were any such Priest-hood,
and Tythes in that Right did appertain to the
Church; it is most like that our Saviour Christ and
his Apostles would have challenged them: But <hi>there
is no one precept in the New Testament concerning
paying of Tythes,</hi> but only for a sufficient Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for the Ministers of the Gospel.</q> Judge now,
Reader, whether this man thought (as the Priest
does) That our Lord Jesus and his Apostles have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
established Tythes for the Maintenance of
the Gospel Ministers; That Christ hath assigned
Tythes to the Gospel Ministers; and that they may
be proved out of the New Testament to be due <hi>jure
divino.</hi> But leaving these Testimonies to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's
censure, I proceed now to examine his Right
to Tythes by Donation, and voluntary Dedication,
which in his next Section he makes way for, but
does not directly enter upon, being diverted by a
passage or two in my Book, which it seems lay in his
way.</p>
            <p>§. 8. First he falls with great anger upon me; for
saying in pag. 287. of my Book, called, <hi>Truth Prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Though Christ d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t if men will grant
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65611:81"/>
them, it will serve the Priests turn.</hi> This he calls
<hi>a most malicious Inference,</hi> pag. 72.</p>
            <p>But who sees not the Truth of it? Care they (I
speak of the generality of them) how they come by
them, so they can get them? Regard they whether
they have them from God or Man? If some among
them do, yet that this Priest doth not, no man that
indifferently reads his Book, can doubt. But he
thinks to pinch me closer upon this point; <hi>I know,</hi>
sayes he to his dear Brother, <hi>you never said nor
thought that Christ denyed Tythes, and since the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<hi>affirms, that Christ doth deny them, let him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the place of Scripture where Christ doth deny
Tythes to be given or granted to Gospel Ministers, or
else he is a manifest Slanderer of Christ in this Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,</hi>
pag. 73.</p>
            <p>I should not have thought this passage worth Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing,
but to detect his weakness, and shew him
how severely he <hi>jerks</hi> himself, while he thinks to lash
me. If I do not produce the place of Scriptur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
where Christ doth deny Tythes to be given to Gospel
Ministers, he Brands me for a manifest Slanderer of
Christ. He himself sayes, <hi>Our Lord Iesus and his
Apostles have sufficiently established Tythes for the
Maintenance of the Gospel Ministers,</hi> pag. 61. yet
produces no place of Scripture where our Lord Jesus
and his Apostles have sufficiently established Tythes
for the Maintenance of the Gospel Ministers, but on
the contrary confesses, <hi>Tythes are not mentioned in the
Gospel or Epistles to be the very part,</hi> pag. 67. and that
<hi>Tythes are not mentioned in the New Testament by
name,</hi> ibid. Nor only so, but affirms <hi>Our Lord and
his Apostles did not make a new determination of the
tenth part by name,</hi> pag. 69. and that <hi>Our Lord</hi>

               </gap>
that can so freely <hi>stigmatize</hi> me for <hi>a manifest Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer</hi>
of Christ, what will he think fit to call himself?
what <hi>badge</hi> will himself vouchsafe to <hi>wear?</hi> He sayes,
<hi>Christ hath assigned Tythes to the Gospel Ministers,</hi>
pag. 72. but himself hath <hi>not assigned</hi> any place of
Scripture for the proof thereof. Shall I take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to say by Retortion, <hi>Let him produce the place
of Scripture where Christ hath assigned Tythes to the
Gospel-Ministers, or else he is a manifest Slanderer of
Christ in this suggestion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next occasion he takes to fall upon me, is for
taking King <hi>Ethelwolf's</hi> for the oldest Charter. And

<hi>he sayes,</hi> He will look back into the Ages before K.
<hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> and shew by what Authority and presidents
he made this Donation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> He will consider
the Donation it self, and the State of those Times in
which it was made. <hi>Thirdly.</hi> He will note how it hath
been confirmed since. And then, <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Wipe off <hi>T. E's</hi>
particular blots thrown upon this sacred Maintenance,
<hi>pag.</hi> 74.</p>
            <p>In this Method I intend to follow him, with what
brevity I can, not insisting on every particular which
might be spoken to in this part of his Discourse; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>human</hi> Right necessarily depending on the

<hi>unproved,</hi> what can be urged in Defence
of the Human Right will have <hi>the less weight,</hi> and need
the less Answer.</p>
            <p>§ 1. <hi>He begins with the Apostles Times, and
sayes, pag.</hi> 75. The Apostles having given a general
Rule for the Faithful to Communicate unto their
Teachers in all good things, the Primitive <hi>Christians</hi>
did alwayes make liberal Oblations to their Pastors, not
only of Houses and Lands, as we read in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but also of many and other things, which being
Collected every Lord'<hi>s</hi>-Day, was delivered to the Bishop,
saith <hi>Justin Martyr.</hi>

            <p>Should I now take the liberty to deal by him, as

Ministers of the Gospel is—established by Divine
Authority, pag. 284. and after said, What this
Maintenance is, is expresly set down by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
pag. 286. He thrusts the word <hi>[Only]</hi> into
my Grant, and reports me to say, Divine Authority
had <hi>only</hi> established a Maintenance in general, and
thereupon infers, if he have established it <hi>only</hi> in
general, then hath he not expressed the <hi>particulars;</hi>
not sticking at a <hi>down-right forgery,</hi> that he might

would be so <hi>unworthy</hi> and <hi>dishonest</hi> as to <hi>imitate him</hi>

pag. 61. But his <hi>unfair</hi> dealing by me
shall not, I hope, make me forget how to behave my

               </gap>ead that the <hi>Christians</hi> gave <hi>Houses and Lands</hi> to

St. <hi>Luke</hi> indeed, in his History of the <hi>Acts of the

he makes this Ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
by the <hi>Christians</hi> to their Pastors, to be the <hi>effect</hi> of
that general <hi>Rule</hi> given by the Apostle to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to Communicate unto their Teachers in all good
things, mentioned in the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
whereas thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>selling</hi> of Possessions, and living in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
was not only <hi>long before</hi> that Epistile was

himself converted to the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not be done in <hi>Observance</hi> of that general
<hi>Rule.</hi> 2. Because in that History of the <hi>Apostles
Acts,</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> doth not say, that any made Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>viz.</hi> that as many as were Possessors of Lands or
Houses <hi>sold them,</hi> and brought the <hi>prices</hi> of the
things that were sold, and laid them down at the
Apostles feet, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 34. to the end. So that here
was <hi>not an Offering of Houses and Lands,</hi> but of
<hi>Money,</hi> which the Priest mentions besides, as <hi>distinct</hi>
from the Oblations of Houses and Lands, and as
leaning upon <hi>another Authority:</hi> for he refers the
Oblatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Scripture; but the Oblation of <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>other
things</hi> to the Testimony of <hi>Iustin Martyr.</hi> The
Apostles (he sayes) having given a general Rule for

               </gap>ul to communicate unto their Teachers in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:65611:84"/>
all good things, the Primitive <hi>Christians</hi> did alwayes
make liberal Oblations to their Pastors, <hi>not only</hi> of
Houses and Lands <hi>as we read in holy Scripture, but
also</hi> of Money and other things; which being Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
every Lords Day was delivered to the Bishop,
saith <hi>Iustin Martyr.</hi> Here its plain he makes the
Oblations of <hi>Houses and Lands distinct</hi> from that of
<hi>Money</hi> and <hi>other</hi> things. The <hi>former,</hi> he sayes, we
read in <hi>holy Scripture,</hi> the <hi>latter</hi> he tells us <hi>Iustin
Martyr</hi> saith. If he has read in holy Scripture this
Oblation of <hi>Houses and Lands,</hi> I desire he would
direct to the place, that I may read it also. But if
be no where reads this in holy Scripture, but adds
this amplification as a <hi>Flourish</hi> to his D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>scourse, he is
<hi>the more to be blamed</hi> in this, and the <hi>less to be credited</hi>
in the rest. How <hi>lean</hi> a Case doth he advocate, that
needs the help of such <hi>sorry shifts!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides, he abuses his Reader in his application as
well as in his allegation; for he intimates as if those
liberal Oblations had been made by the Primitive
<hi>Christians</hi> to their Pastors for their proper use and
Maintenance; whereas it is evident in holy Scripture
that they who sold their Possessions, and laid the
prices at the Apostles feet, did <hi>deposit</hi> that money in a
<hi>common</hi> Stock or Treasury, for the Maintenance of
<hi>all</hi> such as were gathered into that Community; out
of which Stock <hi>Distribution was made unto every
man according as he had need,</hi> Acts 4. 35. So that those
Oblations were not made as a <hi>peculiar</hi> Maintenance
for the Apostles or Pastors, but for the <hi>common</hi> Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of <hi>all</hi> the Faithful, as well <hi>hearers</hi> as <hi>teachers,</hi>
in that place. And when afterwards the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of that Way appearing, they came to make
Weekly and Monethly Contributions, the Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ey
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:65611:84"/>
so collected was not <hi>appropriated</hi> to the use of the
Apostles, Pastors or Teachers, but both intended for,
and imployed to the Relief of the <hi>poor Saints in
general,</hi> as may be seen in divers places of Scripture,
particularly in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. where concerning the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
for the Saints, the Apostle advises, that upon
the first day of the week, every one should lay by
him in store, as God had prospered him, Promising
withal, that when he came to them, whomsoever
they by their Letters should approve, he would send
to carry this Gift of theirs to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> yea, and
to go himself with it, if need require. And in his
second Epistle to the same Church, Chap. 9. he reminds
them of this Charitable Work, which in general
terms, he calls <hi>a Ministring to the Saints;</hi> and though
he exhorts them to liberality and bounty, yet so far
is he from prescribing any certain quantity, that he
leaves all to this absolute liberty, <hi>Every man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give,</hi>
Vers. 7. and in the 9th Vers. alluding to the words
of the Psalmist, he plainly shews this charitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution
was for the <hi>Relief</hi> of the <hi>Poor; He hath
dispersed abroad, he hath given to the Poor,</hi> &amp;c. And
that these contributions were for the <hi>Poor,</hi> he speaks
expresly, <hi>Rom. 15. 25, 26. But now I go unto</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
<hi>to Minister unto the Saints; for it hath pleased
them of</hi> Macedonia <hi>and</hi> Achaia, <hi>to make a certain
Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ribution for the poor Saints which are at</hi> Jerusalem.
It was not therefore fairly done of the Priest to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
his Reader, that these weekly Collections
made by the <hi>Christians</hi> for the Relief of their <hi>Poor
Brethren,</hi> were Oblations or Offerings to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and Teachers for their <hi>peculiar</hi> use, as he seems
to do: Which yet if they had been, it would not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:65611:85"/>
in any measure have proved Tythes, since <hi>no certain
quantity</hi> is exprest, much less a tenth; nor any <hi>forced</hi>
Maintenance, they being altogether <hi>free</hi> and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary.</p>
            <p>§. 2. <hi>But he is willing to hasten from Scripture-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
finding nothing there that may serve his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
therefore he sayes, pag.</hi> 75. Not to expaliate
into the whole Maintenance of the <hi>Christian</hi> Bishops
and Priests in the first Ages, he will come to enquire
whether they had nothing in that Maintenance Answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Tythes; yea, Whether they had not Tythes given
them by a voluntary Devotion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>For this he offers the Testimony of</hi> Irenaus, <hi>thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
pag.</hi> 76. We ought to offer to God the first Fruits of his
Creatures, as <hi>Moses</hi> saith, Thou shalt not appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord empty: for not all kind of Oblations are
abrogated; there were Olations among them, and there
are Oblations among <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And a little after, thus,</hi> As the <hi>Jews</hi> gave their
tenths, so the <hi>Christians</hi> gave all they had freely and
cheerfully to the Lords uses, not giving less then they, as
having a greater hope.</p>
            <p>In the first of these places <hi>no mention at all</hi> is made
of Tythes, but of first Fruits, and that with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to <hi>the Law of</hi> Moses, not binding to <hi>Christians.</hi>
In the latter it is evident <hi>the</hi> Christians <hi>did not give
Tythes,</hi> or any thing answering Tythes: for the
words are express, they gave <hi>all they had freely</hi> and
chearfully to the Lords uses. So that neither of these
places serve his end.</p>
            <p>But because he here (and else-where in Ancient
Writers) reads the word <hi>first fruits,</hi> he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
his Reader that first Fruits and Tythes are

his Review on that Chapter, shews more at large
that they are so.</p>
            <p>§. 3. The Priest quotes here a Sentence out of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen,</hi>
wherein first Fruits are mentioned, but <hi>not a

he makes <hi>Origen</hi> conclude from hence, that the Law
of Tythes and first Fruits ought to stand in force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

whose words are, Haec diximus asserentes modatum

which the Priest (for his own end) hath slyly thrust
the word <hi>[Tythes]</hi> and made him say the Law of
<hi>Tythes</hi> and first Fruits ought to stand. What credit
is to be given to such a Man!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor deals he much better with</hi> Cyprian <hi>whom he
quotes next, after this manner,</hi> To him <hi>(sayes he,
pag. 79.)</hi> we may add St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who lived about
forty years after, who commending the Nobleness of the

Tythes out of their Inheritance, which <hi>(sayes the Priest)
Cyprian</hi> would not have done, but that he believed

            <p>He that shall fairly consu't the place, will easily

Tythes; but comparing the Oblations of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<hi>Christians,</hi> with those of the time wherein he
lived, he shews the decay of Devotion to be such,

saying,</hi> The Scripture exhorteth the People that out
of their just Labours they should give to the Priests for
their Maintenace, First Fruits, Oblations, and other
things.</p>
            <p>To this a twofold Answer is to be given. 1. That
here is <hi>no mention of Tythes;</hi> and though the Priest,
for want of better proof, would fain have first fruits
understood for Tythes, yet so contrary is it to all
reason, that no man of Judgment can be in danger
to be so misled. 2. When he saith, the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth
the People to give the Priest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> First Fruits for
their Maintenance, since we are certain no Scripture
of the New-Testament doth so exhort, he must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
be understood to speak this with relation
to the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law, which as it was designed for,
and given to, so it did particularly concern the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Nation, not the <hi>Christians.</hi> And that the Payment
of Tythes were not in use in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his time, nor
accounted necessary, <hi>Selden</hi> proves from <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
his own words (in <hi>Heres.</hi> 50.) The whole Passage,

or those which thought the holy <hi>Easter</hi>
must be kept on the 14th Moon, according to the

because they apprehended that the keeping it

                  </gap>, that
is, they do all things, or agree generally with the
Church, sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing that they were too much herein
addicted to the <hi>Iewish</hi> Custom. And in his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
against them, he shews, that the Course hath
not reference only to the Passover, but also to <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi>
to <hi>Tythes</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to
<hi>Offerings.</hi> Wherefore (as he goes on) if they
escape one curse, by keeping their <hi>Easter</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of the Passover, they thrust
themselves into many other. For (saith he) they
shall find them also accursed that are not Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
and them cursed that pay not Tythes, and
them cursed that Offer not at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Let
any man now (sayes <hi>Selden)</hi> consider if this Bishop,
that was least unacquainted with the Customs of
the <hi>Christian-Church,</hi> understood not clearly that
no <hi>necessary</hi> or <hi>known use of payment</hi> was among
<hi>Christians</hi> in his time, <hi>of Tythes,</hi> no more then o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Circumcision, or Offering at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Doth
he not plainly reckon it as a thing not only <hi>not in
Christian use,</hi> but even equals it with what was
<hi>certainly abrogated?</hi> Is not his Objection shortly
thus? Why do you not observe Circumcision and
Tything, and Offerings also at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which
are all subject to the like Curse? And because some
kind of Offerings indeed were in use among <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
therefore in the Objection he providently
ties them to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> But of Tything he speaks
as generally as of Circumcision.</q> Thus far <hi>Seld<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That Tythes were <hi>not paid</hi> in the Apostles times,
is both evident from Scripture, and granted by the
Priest: That Tythes were not paid in the first two
Hundred Years after Christ, may be fairly Collected

Then for the next fifty Years, those words of <hi>Cyprian</hi>

For he noting the coldness of their Charity then, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

<hi>They then sold Houses and Lands, and brought the

due (if any such Custom or Opinion had been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral)

is ground to suppose, that in <hi>Augustin's</hi> time, in some

But be it true or false, the Priest hath not

those Text, which shew whence he derived the claim

only, and with allusion to the <hi>Iewish</hi> State. Some
mention Tythes by way of <hi>provocation</hi> to stir up the

about four hundred Years after Christ, Preach up
Tythes to be due, but <hi>to the Poor;</hi> and enforce the

            <p>§. 4. <hi>At the close of his Testimonies, the Priest
sayes,</hi> Now I hope the <hi>Quaker</hi> will not say all these

grounded their Dedication on, and to the <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Popery</hi> which he then gave, of which more
hereafter. However, I see no necessity either: to

he hath not proved, and I deny, that Tythes were
instituted, required or paid in the times of <hi>Irenaeus</hi>
or <hi>Origen,</hi> or well-nigh two hundred Years after.
But of the times in and about which Tythes began to
be thought due, and as so paid (which <hi>Selden</hi> is positive,
was not till about the end of the fourth Century, and
the beginning of the fifth) and of the State of the
Church then, and some what earlier also, not to speak
my own Sense, I will give the Reader a short View,
and submit it to his judgment.</p>

as <hi>Origen) Prayers, Offerings and Sacrifices for the
Dead</hi> began to be in use in the Church. <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
who lived in that time, mentions these things in his
Book <hi>De Corona Militis,</hi> and sayes, <hi>They sprang from
Tradition.</hi>

            <p>As early also was the Opinion of <hi>Purgatory</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

            <p>Much about the same time crept in the Opinion of
the <hi>Intercession of Saints</hi> departed this life, from
which sprang the Custom of <hi>Praying to Saints.</hi> And
though for some time this was disputed amongst the
Learned of those times, yet towards the latter end
of the fourth Century (much about the same time
that Tythes began to be thought due) this Custom
of <hi>Praying to Saints</hi> grew in use in the Church. And

            <p>§. 6. In his first <hi>Regiment</hi> of Councils, that which
leads the <hi>Van,</hi> pag. 85. is the Counterfeit Canons
falsly ascribed to the Apostles; of which enough
hath been said before to <hi>det<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>him</hi>
for urging them. Next comes up the Council of
<hi>Gangra</hi> held about the Year 324. in the seventh and
eighth Canons of which, <hi>Tythes</hi> (he sayes) <hi>are called</hi>
[<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] which he Englishes (but

                  </gap>esiastical Tribute of Fruits.</hi> But bearing
with the Translation, let him shew (if he can) that
Tythes are mentioned, by name, in any Canon of
that Council. If not, Why abuses he his Reader in
saying, <hi>Tythes are there</hi> called Ecclesiastical Tribute
of Fruits? A like falshood he imposes on his Reader
in his next quotation of the Council of <hi>Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

held in the Year 341. (as he sayes, but in the Year
345. sayes <hi>Burdegalens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>The profits of the Church, or the Fruits of the Fields.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is that to the proof of Tythes? Could th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

must needs be Tythes? If Tythes had been named

               </gap> that Council, why did he not shew that? But if
they were not named there, why does he play upon
his Reader, and endeavour to perswade him they

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e? Is he not ashamed to say, he finds many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Councils suppose Tythe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rdering how Tythes should be distributed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and yet cannot shew out of those antient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
(as he calls them) that Tythes were so much as <hi>oncé
named</hi> in them?</p>
            <p>To these Councils (for credit sake, and to increase
the number) he adds <hi>the Canonical Epistle</hi> (as he
calls it) <hi>of</hi> St. Cyrill <hi>of</hi> Alexandria <hi>to</hi> Domnus, where,
he sayes, he finds, <hi>mention of Ecclesiastical Revenues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then, is nothing an Ecclesiastical Revenue
but Tythes? If he had found that Revenue there
called Tythes, he had t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>en found something to his
purpose; but as it is, it helps him not at all. See
now what his great boast of MANY <hi>Antient</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
which <hi>suppose Tythes to have been paid,</hi> &amp;c. is
come to. The first has long since been <hi>branded</hi> for a
<hi>Counterfeit,</hi> the two next have <hi>not a word of Tythes,</hi>
the fourth and last is <hi>not</hi> the Decree of a Council,
but the Epistle of a <hi>single</hi> Person, and that sayes <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Tythes</hi> neit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er. And yet, such is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest
Confidence of the man, that he doth not
stick to say, pag. 86. <hi>In the fore-cited places it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
that</hi> Tythes <hi>and</hi> First Fruits <hi>were given to the
Church long before the Year of Christ</hi> 324. So in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
I think they had need to have been, if they had

as that is very fairly disproved, by his own dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

               <hi>too low</hi> to prove his

Assertion. For how should these, who lived so
near the end of the sixth Century, understand the
Practice of the first Times, what was done in the
beginning, and what was paid in the earliest
dayes of <hi>Christianity, better</hi> then they whose lot fell
<hi>nearer</hi> to the first Times by well-nigh the one half?
Or what likelihood is there, that if Tythes had been
<hi>paid</hi> from the beginning, from the <hi>earliest</hi> dayes of
<hi>Christianity,</hi> no one of those many Councils before
remembred, should so much as <hi>once</hi> have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Tythes, especially seeing divers of them speak
particularly of the Offerings, Oblations, Rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nues
and Treasure of the Church? But this Council
intimates, that <hi>Tythes had been paid for a long
time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then, must that long time be extended to
the <hi>very beginning,</hi> to the <hi>earliest dayes</hi> of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</hi>
No such matter. <hi>Selden</hi> sayes, <q>
                  <hi>That

much as any Canon of it is found mentioned, as of

to the Readers observation &amp; judgment, I go on to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin
his next quotation out of the Council of <hi>Hispalis,</hi>
which he Dates in the Year 590. and delivers in these
words, <hi>We ordain that all the Fruits and Tythes as well
of Cattel as of Fruits, be rightly offered to their
several Churches, by Rich and Poor, according to the
saying of the Lord by the Prophet, Bring ye all the
Tythes into the Store-House,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>For as God hath
given us all, so of all he requireth Tythe of the Profits
of the Field, and all Provisions, of Bee's and Honey,
Lambs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And he that payes not Tythes of all
these, is a Thief to God himself,</hi> pag. 88. His ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
on this is, That <hi>they all declare Tythes to be

an express Canon for the payment of first Fruits
and Tenths, to the provincial Synod of <hi>Sivil,</hi> and
giving the words of that Canon, little different from
these quoted by the Priest, sayes, The old Manuscript
Copy of <hi>Iuo</hi> hath it, <hi>ex concili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a little at the word <hi>[Spanensi]</hi> he adds, <q>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he meant by it, clearly the whole Canon is of
much later time, the first words of it also being
nothing but the Syllables of one of <hi>Charlemains</hi>
Laws, that was not made till 780. years from
Christ.</q> He observes also that <q>
                  <hi>Gratian</hi> warily
abstained from using these Canons;</q> and a little after
concludes positively, That <q>among the known and
certain Monuments of Truth, till about the end
800 years, no Law Pontificial of or Synodal (saving
that of <hi>Mascon)</hi> Determins or Commands any
thing concerning Tenths, although very many are
which, speaking purposely and largely of Church
Revenues, Oblations, and such like, could not
have been silent of them, if that quantity had been
then established for a certain duty.</q> He then
shews that the <hi>Canonists</hi> and others in later Ages, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piling
their Decrees, have made those words, by
which the Offerings of the <hi>Christians</hi> were expressed,
to serve as if they had expresly named Tythes (in
which Observation he seems to take this very Priest
by the Nose) and concludes thus, <q>He that reads
those old Canons only, as they are so applied, in
late Authority, to Tythes, might perhaps soon think
that at first they were made specially and by name
for them. The matters <hi>(sayes he)</hi> is plainly otherwise.
What was ordained in them about Tythes, is out of
them in later times (Tythes &amp; Oblatio <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

little regarded.</p>
            <p>§. 8. <hi>Now let us observe the Laws he offers, made
by</hi> Kings <hi>and</hi> Emperours <hi>concerning Tythes. The
first he instances is of</hi> Constantine <hi>the Great,</hi> Who <hi>(he
sayes, pag. 89.)</hi> being settled in his Empire, in the
Lands under his Dominion, out of every City gave a
certain Tribute, to be distributed among the <hi>Church</hi>
and <hi>Clergy</hi> of the Provinces, and confirmed this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to stand forever.</p>
            <p>If this be true, yet what relation hath this to
Tythes? If <hi>Constantine</hi> gave a <hi>Tribute</hi> out of every
City, doth it thence follow that that Tribute was
<hi>Tythes</hi> or the <hi>Tenth</hi> part of the Revenue of those
Cities? Or if that should be supposed, would the
Priest thence infer, that the Country People, the
Farmers, the Husband-men, who lived not in the
Cities, but in the Country-Towns and Villages, were
by this Donation obliged to pay the <hi>Tythes</hi> of the
<hi>Increase</hi> of the Lands, which they man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied?
What need had there been then of such a
<hi>Tribute</hi> out of the Cities? This instance of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>'s
Donation, if it be allowed to prove any thing,
will rather prove that <hi>Tythes were not then paid,</hi> then
that they were. But the Truth of the Donation is
questioned. <hi>Cusanus</hi> sayes thus of it, <q>

Authorites <hi>Perkins</hi> produces to prove the Donation

it be false or true, <hi>it speaks nothing of Tythes,</hi>
and therefore is the less to be regarded.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:65611:101"/>
               <hi>The Priest goes on thus,</hi> It were endles's to relate
all the Constitutions of pious Emperours either to enlarge
the Revenues of the Church, to preserve its Liberties, or to
secure the Donations made by others. Let that one
Law which is so full for the Divine Right of Tythes, serve
instead of many instances, <hi>pag.</hi> 89.</p>
            <p>I cannot but take notice, how <hi>short-winded</hi> this
Priest is when he comes in <hi>earnest</hi> to produce his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities.
He <hi>talks big</hi> before-hands, and gives great
expectation of what he will do, but when he comes
to the Point, how <hi>mean</hi> (Alas!) is his performance
in respect of the <hi>preparation</hi> he makes! What a <hi>noise</hi>
did he make of Councils ere now! Who that heard
him would not have almost thought, that <hi>All the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient

Tythes upon the Clergy? And yet after all this <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi>

any one doubt (who observes his manner of writing)
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:65611:102"/>
that this is only a <hi>Flourish</hi> to hide his <hi>penury?</hi> It had
been worth his while (though he had taken a little
the more time for it) to have given us some of the
<hi>most material</hi> of those MANY Constitutions of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Emperours, which he sayes it were ENDLESS
to relate; and it is not to be questioned but so he
would, could he have found amongst them <hi>All</hi> any
that had spoken <hi>but favourable</hi> of Tythes. But
since <hi>no more are to be had,</hi> let us look the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently
on this he doth give, and see whether it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
to serve instead of <hi>Many</hi> instances. He words
it thus, pag. 89. <hi>The Tythes by God'</hi>s <hi>Command are
separated for the Priests, that they which are of Gods
Family may be sustained by his Portion, and therefore
they cannot by any human Priviledge be given to Lay-men;
lest the Supream Authority should therein pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
the Divine Commandment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I see no reason for his calling this a <hi>Law,</hi> which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a <hi>Declaration</hi> by <hi>Doctrine,</hi> then a <hi>Constitution</hi> by
<hi>Precept.</hi> If it be a <hi>Law,</hi> he might have done well
to have acquainted his Reader <hi>who was the Law-maker.</hi>
He neither tells us who was the <hi>Author</hi> of
it, nor in <hi>what Age</hi> 'twas made; but sets it down

they are, it deserves not the name of a <hi>Law,</hi> much

serve instead of <hi>many</hi> instances: for it <hi>injoyns</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

            <p>It may be so. But where he <hi>found</hi> it, there it

            <p>The Story of <hi>Riccaredus</hi> I am a stranger to, and

and growing every day <hi>worse</hi> and <hi>worse,</hi> as I

I have already shewed; That <hi>these Doctrines and

has now found in the Epistle of this Arch-Bishop <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niface,</hi>
comes <hi>much too late</hi> to clear Tythes from the

he would use the Authority of it to prove his

which they call Churches, <hi>over and above</hi> their Tythes

expresly that the Tythes being divided into

refer it to either of them, and it will be divers
years later then <hi>Egbert</hi>'s death. And (adds he)
other mixt Passages there plainly shew, that whose
soever the Collection was, much of it was taken
out of the Imperial Capitularies, none of which
were made in <hi>Egbert</hi>'s time. Perhaps (sayes he)
the greatness of <hi>Egbert</hi>'s name was the cause why
some later Compiler of those Excerptions might
so inscribe it, to gain it Authority.</q> And a little

although most of the particulars of Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
are toucht there.</q> Thus far <hi>Selden</hi> in his
History of Tythes, c. 8. §. 1. whose words I have
here set down the more at large, that the Reader
may see not only his judgment of this Collection,
but the Reasons also, on which his judgment was
grounded; which I doubt not will satisfie the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and <hi>disinteressed</hi> Reader that neither was that
Collection of Canons made by <hi>Egbert,</hi> nor are
those Canons themselves of so great Antiquity as the
Priest pretends, and would gladly have them taken
to be.</p>
            <p>To these fore-mentioned Canons, he adds ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Council of <hi>Chalcuth,</hi> which he dates in
the Year 787. and gives in these words, <hi>All men
are strictly charged to give Tythes of all that they Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses's,

part that specially belongs to him,</hi> pag. 93.</p>
            <p>Whether this Canon be <hi>genuine</hi> or no, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
doubtful. Some Objections lie against it, as
the making <hi>Renulph,</hi> King of <hi>West-Saxony,</hi> to joyn
with <hi>Offa</hi> in calling the Council, which seems not well
to agree with <hi>Renulph</hi>'s time; and some other <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi>
of Names, which possibly the mistake of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers
might occasion. But that which is more
material is, that <hi>the very Syllables of this</hi> Canon <hi>are
found among some Constitutions made by</hi> Odo <hi>Arch-Bishop
of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>about 150. Years <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fter the
Date of this</hi> Canon. See <hi>Selden</hi>'s History of Tythes,

that which I observe is, that <hi>this Council</hi> (or Synod

from</hi> Rome <hi>by Pope</hi> Hadrian <hi>the first;</hi> which plainly
shews both that the Popes <hi>Primacy</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> was
<hi>before</hi> that time received and own'd in <hi>England,</hi> that
this Council was held <hi>in Subjection</hi> to him, and that
the Church of <hi>England</hi> was then <hi>in Communion</hi> with
the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> All which is deduceable from
that Epistle written by the said Legates to the Pope,
in which giving him a particular Account of the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
of that Synod, they have these words,

These Decrees, most blessed Father <hi>Hadrian,</hi> WE
PROPOSED in the publique Council before K.
<hi>Aelfwald</hi> and Arch-Bishop <hi>Eanbald</hi> &amp; all the Bishops
&amp; Abbots of the Country, as also the Senators, Dukes
and People of the Land; and they with all devotion
of mind, as we said before, did Solemnly Promise,
that by the help of God's Mercy, they would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them in all things according to their utmost
Ability, and they confirmed them in OUR hand
in YOUR STEAD with the sign of the Cross,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a little after, acquainting the Pope that
the same Decrees were forthwith carried to the
Council held the same time under <hi>Offa</hi> for the West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
part (for the Legates it seems divided, and went
one to <hi>Aelfwald</hi> in the North, 'tother to <hi>Offa</hi> in the
West) adds, that upon the reading thereof, <q>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

YOUR APOSTLESHIP, did Promise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time was hath been some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

But of <hi>Pope Adrian</hi> himself, who sent those <hi>Legates</hi>
hither, and by whose procurement and Authority that
Council was held, take a Character from <hi>Iohn Fox</hi>

(sayes he) the steps of his Fore-Fathers the

Images more then all the other had done before,
writing a Book for the ADORATION and

their institution from Popery, when <hi>this very Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

in</hi> England <hi>before</hi> Ethelwolf's <hi>time. His words are
these, pag.</hi> 94. If it be inquired what Laws our Princes
made in this matter: Not to mention all those Charters
which from the first beginning of <hi>Christianity,</hi> do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
all the Liberties, and all the Revenues of the
Church (among which were Ty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>s) we will only note,
that <hi>Ethelbald</hi> King of <hi>Mercia, Anno.</hi> 794. confirms
to all the Clergy of his Kingdom the Liberty which they
had out of the Woods, the Fruit of the Ground, and the
taking of Fish. And this (being after that Epistle of
the <hi>German Boniface,</hi> which assured us Tythes were
then enjoyed by the Clergy) must <hi>(he sayes)</hi> be meant
of Tythes.</p>
            <p>In the former part of these words there is a <hi>flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish</hi>
and a <hi>falshood.</hi> The <hi>flourish</hi> in these words <hi>[not

<hi>an empty found of words</hi> without matter? The <hi>falshood</hi>
in these words <hi>[Tythes were among the Revenues of the

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:65611:109"/>
can. Then for the Donation or Confirmation of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelbald:
It speaks nothing of Tythes,</hi> but discharges
the Monasteries and Churches of his Kingdom from
publick Taxes, Burdens and Services (some few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
and then sayes, <hi>Let the Servants of God</hi> (it
speaks generally, not the Priest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> or Clergy only)
<hi>have their own liberty in the Fruits of the Woods and
Fields, and in taking Fish, that they need not make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
to the King or to the Princes, unless they do it of
their own accord, but being free let them serve God,</hi>
&amp;c. Here's <hi>no mention of Tythes;</hi> and if there had,
yet I think the Priest would have been hard bestead
to have acquitted them by this Donation from a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi>
Institution, or to have proved this Charter made
before <hi>Popery</hi> had made her encroachments in the
Church; especially if we consider that <hi>Fox</hi> in his
Book of Martyrs, <hi>gives this very Charter as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the</hi> Popish <hi>blindness of that Age.</hi> His words
(speaking of them that builded &amp; endowed Churches,
Monasteries, Abbies, &amp;c.) are these, <q>The cause
and end of their Deeds and Buildings cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused,
being contrary to the Rule of Christ's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
for so much as they did these things seeking
thereby Merits with God, and for remedy of their
Souls, and remission of their Sins, as may appear
testified in their own Records, whereof one here I
thought to set forth for probation of the same.</q>
Then he sets down this very Charter of <hi>Ethelbald,</hi>
and after adds, <q>By the Contents hereof may well
be understood (as where he saith, Pro amore ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestis
Petriae, pro remedio anime, pro liberatione

the love of the Heavenly Country, for the remedy
of my Soul, for the deliverance of my Soul, and

pardon of my Sins, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> how great the ignorance
and blindness of these men was, who lacking no
Zeal, only lacked Knowledge to rule it withal:
Seeking their Salvation not by Christ only, but by
their own deservings and meritorious Deeds.</q> Thus
far <hi>Fox</hi> in his <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Monuments</hi> of the Church,
<hi>Vol. 1. l.</hi> 2. toward the end. From which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may observe how contrary his Opinion of those
times was to this Priest, who brings the very same
Charter for proof that Tythes were settled on the
Church <hi>before Popery</hi> had made her encroachments in
it, which <hi>Fox</hi> gave as an <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

himself was <hi>a lewd and vitious person. Speed</hi> in his

<hi>Ethelbert</hi> had some other design, perswaded her
Husband to kill him: <hi>Offa</hi> thereupon the next day
caused him to be trained into his Palace alone from
his Company by one called <hi>Guimbertus,</hi> who took
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:65611:110"/>
him and bound him, and there struck off his Head,
which forth-with he presented to the King and
Queen—<hi>Offa</hi> length understanding the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of thus King, and the heinous Cruelty of the
Fact, gave the tenth part of his Goods to holy
Church, and to the Church of <hi>Hereford,</hi> in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of this <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> he bestowed great <hi>Lands</hi>
—and afterwards went up to <hi>Rome</hi> for his Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
where he gave to the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi>
a Penny through every House in his Dominion—
and there at length was translated from a King to a
Monk,</q> 
               <hi>Martyrol. vol.</hi> 1. pag. 117. Here now we
see the <hi>cause</hi> of this Gift was a <hi>most barbarous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
and the Gift <hi>the price of innocent Blood.</hi> Yet
this Gift of <hi>Offa's</hi> was but <hi>particular,</hi> the tenth of <hi>his
own</hi> Goods, not a <hi>general</hi> act, nor find we that he
made any Law to compel others to do the like. But
the Priest urges that this <hi>Offa had with all his Clergy
condemned the adoration of Images, and so was no Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later.</hi>
That he and all his Clergy did condemn the
adoration of Images, is more I think then the Priest
can prove; but suppose that, doth it therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that he was no Idolater? <hi>Is nothing then Idolatry
but worshipping of Images?</hi> What's the <hi>praying to
Saints?</hi> What's the <hi>worshipping of Relicks?</hi> Will the
Priest say that <hi>Offa</hi> and all his Clergy had condemned
this also. Hee'l say perhaps he was no <hi>Papist</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>What went he up to</hi> Rome <hi>for?</hi> What made
him so observant and bountiful to the <hi>Pope?</hi> What
made him before receive the <hi>Popes Legates?</hi> are not
these plain Arguments of his <hi>communion</hi> with the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in which besides all other <hi>Idolatries,</hi>
the <hi>adoration of Images</hi> was then most zealously main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?</p>

From <hi>Offa's</hi> Gift he takes a step of about sixty
Years to <hi>Ethelwolf's</hi> Charter, finding nothing in the
way to countenance Tythes. Now before we enter

            <p>I expected now we should have forth-with entred

he begins it, pag. 97. <hi>But lest there should be any

I forbear to reply to, referring the Reader to what
hath been already said in Answer thereunto in the
former part of this Discourse upon his first Period.
But there is another Passage in this Section, pag. 99.
which I am not willing to pretermit. Amongst other
great things which he speaks of this <hi>Donation,</hi> on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
is, T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>at <hi>the benefit thereof hath been enjoyed for eight
hundred Years by those to whom the Donation was made.</hi>
For this I confess I am beholding to him. He has
helped me to a notable <hi>Medium</hi> to prove what sort
of Priests this Donation was made to, by assuring
me it was made to them, who for so long a time
enjoyed the Benefit of it; which is a Characte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
not at all applicable to the present <hi>English</hi> Clergy, nor
to any other so aptly as to the Popish Priests, who injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the benefit of it by far the longest of any. Though
considering the date of the Charter and the time of
Reformation (between which scarce full seven hundred
Years did intervene) I see not how the Popish Priests
neither can be said to have enjoyed the benefit of
that Donation for eight hundred Years, unless he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that he and his Brethren are <hi>fundamentally</hi>
and in the ground <hi>a part of the same Priesthood</hi> with
them, though in some <hi>min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ter</hi> Circumstances dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing;
and so would reckon the benefit of this
Donation to have been enjoyed for eight hundred
Years <hi>by those and these in common.</hi> But then he should
consider, that this infers the Donation to be made
to those and these in common, the consequence of
which will be, that these and they are <hi>Ministers of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:65611:113"/>
Christ a like.</hi> But because this Passage seems some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <hi>anigmatical,</hi> if I have not fully reacht his
sense, I desire he will explain it in his next. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
I go on to his next Section, in which he notes
three general Exceptions that I take at this Charter
of <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> which in so many Sections he intends
I perceive to <hi>avoid</hi> rather then Answer.</p>
            <p>§. 12. My first exception, <hi>he sayes,</hi> is in respect
of the Author of that Charter, <hi>pag. 289. And here,
he sayes,</hi> I affirm K. <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> was a Papist.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I not only affirmed, but</hi> proved it <hi>from History,
and gave such</hi> demonstrations <hi>of it as he chose rather to</hi>
over-look <hi>then answer. It had become him to have
shewed (if he could) that the instances I gave of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelwolf's
<hi>being a</hi> Papist, <hi>were either</hi> not true, <hi>or</hi> not
conclusive. <hi>But he has not so much as attempted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these. I shewed from good authority that</hi>
Ethelwolf was bred a Monk, took upon him the Vow

present to the Pope, <hi>and</hi> that he was the Pope's Creature.</p>
            <p>All this spoken of <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> particularly, the Priest
passes silently over, without the least touch or note;
and as one that is <hi>ashamed</hi> to confess, and <hi>afraid</hi> to

            <p>But what's this to the purpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e? is not this another
device to <hi>avoid</hi> the matter? Are the Instances I
gave of <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s being a Papist <hi>common to all</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
as well as Papists? 'Tis true indeed, there are
some Tenents common to Papists and all Christians, as
that there is a God, that Christ is come, and hath
suffered for Mankind, &amp;c. But are those things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before of <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> of the Nature of these?
are they received in common by all Christian, as
well as by Papists? Let me come a little nearer
him. He reckons himself not only a Christian, but
a Minister of Christ also; Is what is related before
of <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> consistent with <hi>his</hi> Christianity? If not,
why does he thus abuse both his Reader and me, by
suggesting that what I there spake of <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> is
agreeable to all Christian, as well as Papists. But
if what is spoken before of <hi>Ethe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wolf</hi> be not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to all Christians, but to <hi>Papists only,</hi> I hope
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:65611:114"/>
it will be sufficient proof that <hi>Eth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lwolf</hi> was a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having said who is not a Papist, he now gives us
the definition of a Papist thus, <hi>He is a</hi> Papist <hi>who
professes himself a Member of the</hi> Roman Church,
<hi>and acknowledges the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>opes Suprema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y, believing all
the Articles of the</hi> Roman Church'<hi>s Faith,</hi> p. 101.</p>
            <p>This definition would exclude a great number of
profest <hi>Papists</hi> from being <hi>Papists;</hi> for many that have
lived and dyed in the profession of that Religion, and
in communion with the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>all the Articles</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church's Faith.
Most notorious are the <hi>Controversies</hi> which for many
Ages have been maintained amongst the Religious
Orders of that Church, one sort most hotly and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
impugning the Faith and Opinions of the other,
yet all <hi>Papists.</hi> So that to the constituting a <hi>Papist</hi>
it is not of absolute necessity that he believes <hi>all the
Articles</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church's Faith. But if he
profess himself <hi>a Member</hi> of that Church, and be <hi>in
communion</hi> with it, that's enough to denote him a
Papist. The other Priest in his <hi>Friendly Conference,</hi>
pag. 149. gave his Parishioner a Definition of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery;
his words are these, <hi>I cannot give you a more
brief and true account of</hi> Popery <hi>then this, That it is
such Doctrines and superstitious Practices, which by the
corruption of time have prevailed in the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi>
Rome, <hi>contrary to the true, ancie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, catholick and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolick
Church.</hi> Now if this be a true account of
Popery, and so true an one that he cannot, as he
sayes, give a <hi>more true;</hi> what truer account then can
be given of a Papist then to say, he is a Papist that
holds such Doctrines and su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erstitious Practices, &amp;c.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65611:114"/>
Or, he is a Papist that holds Popery: But Popery
is such Doctrines and superstitious Practices, which
by the Corruption of time have prevailed in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to the true, ancient, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
and apostolick Church. Therefore he that
holds such Doctrines and superstitious Practices,
which by the corruption of time have prevailed in
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to the true, ancient,
catholick and apostolick Church, is a Papist. Now
let us measure <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> by the Priests definition of
Popery, and see how far <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> will fall short of
being a Papist. That <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> held the Doctrine
of the <hi>Caelibate,</hi> or <hi>single life</hi> of Priests, is clear from
his taking upon him the Vow of Single Life when he
entred his Monkish Order. He held the Doctrine
that <hi>the Pope had po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er to absolve and release him from
his Vows,</hi> and accordingly received an Absolution
from the Pope. He held the practice of <hi>burning
Lamps continually</hi> day and night in the houses they
called Churches, and accordingly gave two hundred
Marks a year to buy Oyl to feed the Lamps in two of
those Churches, and that <hi>in Rome.</hi> Now if these
Doctrines and Practices were <hi>superstitious;</hi> if they
were such as by the <hi>corruption of time</hi> prevailed in the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> if they were contrary to the true,
ancient, catholick and apostolick Church (which none
I think but a Papist will deny) then according to the
Priest's Definition <hi>they are Popery,</hi> and consequently
<hi>Ethelwolf</hi> in holding them <hi>was a Papist.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Priest sayes,</hi> King <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> did never
profess himself a Member of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
<hi>ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this strange! What made him then seek
<hi>Absolution</hi> of his Vows <hi>from the Pope?</hi> What caused
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:65611:115"/>
him to go in such <hi>great Devotion to</hi> Rome? What

               </gap>d were that? Verily I cannot see what
should induce this Priest thus to argue, unless he
should have apprehension, that the account which
his Brother Priest has given of Popery, will take in
<hi>him and his Brethren too,</hi> as holding such Doctrines
and <hi>superstitious</hi> Practices, which by the corruption
of time have prevailed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the true, ancient, catholick and apostolick
Church; and has therefore to secure himself from
the Imputation of Popery, invented this <hi>new Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi>
of a Papist.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But when he cannot clear</hi> Ethelwolf <hi>from being a
Papist, he atttempts to justifie his Donation of Tythes
though a Papist, and therefore sayes, pag.</hi> 101. If
we should grant—that <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> was a <hi>Papist,</hi> yet
neither would that make his Donation of Tythes void;
for an erroneous Opinion in the person who doth a thing
good in it self (as we have proved Tythes to be) doth
not make the Act void.</p>
            <p>How <hi>lightly</hi> doth he speak of <hi>Popery!</hi> how willing
he is to <hi>extenuate it! An erroneous Opi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then <hi>Popery</hi> in his Opinion, is but an <hi>erroneous</hi> Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I alwayes thought <hi>Popery</hi> had been at least <hi>one
degree worse</hi> then a bare Erroneous Opinion. But
suppose it for the present to be but an <hi>erroneous</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
yet may not an <hi>erroneous</hi> Opinion be sufficient
to make void an Act which <hi>flows from</hi> that Erroneous
Opinion, and is designed to uphold that Erroneous
Opinion, as this Donation of Tythes did? The <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>
which was the cause of this Donation was this,
<hi>That this Gift would be a means to appease the Anger of
God, obtain remission of Sins and Salvation of his Soul.</hi>
This was (to say on more of it) a <hi>very erroneous</hi> Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:65611:116"/>
and from this <hi>erroneous</hi> Opinion did spring the

for sayes he,</hi> It was for the Maintenance of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Clergy, who had a <hi>Patriarch</hi> of their own in those
dayes, and were a Church of themselves, not holding all
the Opinions of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, nor professing any
Canonical obedience to the Pope—and therefore they
cannot justly be called a <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy.</p>
            <p>That Tythes were given to maintain the <hi>English</hi>
Clergy is not doubted. But what then? Does their
being an <hi>English</hi> Clergy acquit them from being a
<hi>Popish</hi> Clergy? Cannot an <hi>English</hi> Clergy be <hi>Popish?</hi>
I wish with all my Heart it could not. But what I
pray was that Clergy that drank such great Draughts
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:65611:118"/>
of <hi>Protestant</hi> Blood in Q. <hi>Mary's</hi> time? was it not

Tythes were not given to maintain the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy,
because they were given to maintain the <hi>English</hi> Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy.
But this <hi>English</hi> Clergy had (he sayes) in

when it comes to the upshot, we shall find no other
Patriarch of <hi>England</hi> but the Pope, (or some Deputy
of his) who being in the time of the Council at <hi>Nice,</hi>
one of the four Patriarchs of the <hi>Christian</hi> World (as
it was then called) took in these Western parts into
his Patriarchat. And when <hi>Gregory</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>

was then subject to the Patriarch of <hi>Rome,</hi> which it
would not have been, if it had had a Patriarch of its

            <p>He adds, <hi>They were a Church of themselves, not

which let the Reader judge whether the Clergy of

to the Priest; For he says, pag.</hi> 102. Suppose again
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Priests had been <hi>Papists,</hi> that would not
have made the Donation of Tythes invalid, because
Tythes are God's Right, and the Grant was intended to
God.</p>
            <p>So that how bad soever the Clergy was to whom
Tythes were given, 'tis all one, the Donation (if
he may have his will) must stand. But why? <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,</hi>
says he, <hi>Tythes are God's Right?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how come Tythes or Tenths to be Gods Right
more then Nineths or Eighths? <hi>He begs the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
on,</hi> and gives it for proof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds,</hi> The Grant was intended to God.</p>
            <p>He said himself but a few Lines before, <hi>It was for
the Maintenance of the</hi> English <hi>Clergy,</hi> using the
words of <hi>Ingulf,</hi> [Universam dotaverat Ecclesiam
Anglicanam; i. e. <hi>He endowed the whole Church of</hi>
England.] But suppose the Grant intended to God,
must all Grants stand then that were intended to God?
A notable way indeed to revive all the old Grants and
Donations, which in the <hi>thickest</hi> Darkness of <hi>Popish</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:65611:120"/>
Ignorance were by <hi>blind</hi> Zeal and <hi>superstitious</hi> Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
given to Holy Church (as they called it) and
intended to God.</p>
            <p>But what thinkest thou, Reader, makes this Priest
play the Advocate thus for God, and stickle so hard
for God's part? is it his <hi>Care for God,</hi> or his <hi>Love to
himself?</hi> thou shalt see anon the Reason. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to make <hi>himself God's Receiver,</hi> and therefore
no wonder if he talk so much of God's part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he sayes,</hi> The Clergy of that Ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> were God's on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
publick Ministers.</p>
            <p>It seems then he can be content to call the Popish
Clergy God's publick Ministers: but I hope he sees
the consequent, that then th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> popish Church was
God's publick Church, and the popish Worship Gods
publick Worship also; and where then was the
Church, Worship and Ministry of Antichrist, so much
cry'd out against by God's Confessors and holy Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
in almost every Age? Were they the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Ministers of God who believed and held the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Purgatory, of praying for the Dead, of
sacrificing for the Dead, of praying to Saints, of
worshipping Relicks, of Auricular Confession, of

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, Masses, Letanies,
and other Ceremonies of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> By
this, Reader, thou mayst guess what a kind of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
he himself is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds,</hi> The Donors supposed them a good Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
and as such endowed them; for they esteemed them
to be God's Receivers, <hi>p.</hi> 103.</p>
            <p>There's no doubt but the Donors supposed them a
good Ministry; but that Supposition doth neither
make nor prove them so. And seeing they were not
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:65611:120"/>
what the Donors supposed them to be, there is no
reason why that Donation should stand, which was
made upon such a mistake, and without which it had
not been made. For it cannot be supposed the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s
would have made such a Donation, had they
not by Mistake supposed that Ministry (to which
they made it) to be what it was not: and Reason
would, that what was done upon a mistaken Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
should, when the Mistake appears, be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But if all that has been given upon <hi>wrong</hi> Suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
must stand, <hi>his Office</hi> of Receiver may in time
grow very considerable: for, not here to mention
all other popish Gifts, what does he imagine the <hi>Turks</hi>
think of their Priests? Do not they <hi>suppose</hi> them to
be a good Ministry, and <hi>as such</hi> endow them? Do not
they esteem them to be God's Receivers? Whatever
Donations then amongst them have been made, or
shall be, upon this Supposition, shall be valid and in
force, according to his Argument, in succeeding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
and if ever the <hi>Turks</hi> should be prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to assume the Name and Profession of <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
(though otherwise sufficiently erroneous and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt)
this Priest stands ready to be the <hi>Receiver</hi> of
what was given to the <hi>Turkish</hi> Priests, up on the same
Reasons by which he claims what was given to the
popish Priest, viz, That <hi>the Don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

be a good Ministry, and as such endowed them;</hi> that
they esteemed them to be God's Receivers; that the
Grant was intended to God; that if there had been
a Fault in the least, that would not prejudice the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
Title; and that if they had been a <hi>Turkish</hi>
Clergy, and forfeited their own Right, they could
not forfeit <hi>his.</hi> The other Priest one may see has
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:65611:121"/>
the Office in his Eye already; for he says, <hi>Suppose the</hi>
Turkish Empire <hi>(through God's Mercy) should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
to</hi> Christianity, <hi>may not the</hi> Muffti <hi>himself, and
those whom</hi> T. E. <hi>calls</hi> Emaums (which are the <hi>Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi>
Priests) <hi>together with all the</hi> Mosche (which are
their Temples) <hi>and Reven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be reconsecrated to</hi> Christianity? Vindic. pag. 314.
Judge now, Reader, whether with these men <hi>all be
not Fish that come to Net;</hi> and whether it is likely
they would stick at any thing that is like to be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
who have already contrived a Reconsecration of
the <hi>Turkish</hi> Priests Revenues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to go on; The Author of the</hi> Right of Tythes
<hi>pursues his Argument to the same purpose again, pag.
104. (sayes he of</hi> Ethelwolf<hi>'s Clergy</hi>) If they were
erroneous, neither Prince nor People knew it; and they
did not give these to maintain their Errors, but to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that which they believed to be a good Ministry,
and the true Worship of God; and therefore the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
remains good.</p>
            <p>May not all this be said of the <hi>worst state</hi> of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church? nay, may it not be said of the very
<hi>Turk</hi> (whom I mention not for comparison, but il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustration
sake) Does either Prince or People know
that their Priests are erroneous? or do they endow
them to maintain their Errors? nay, do they not give
their Endowments to maintain that which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
to be a good Ministry, and the true Worship of
God? But must those Endowments therefore remain
good, and <hi>Christian</hi> Ministers claim and exact them!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds further, That</hi> though that Clergy were er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,
yet <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> ought to have given them God's
du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the people ought to have paid it to them, <hi>which

                  </gap>gues</hi> as examples <hi>from the Example of the</hi> Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
<hi>Priests, who though very erroneous, had a Right
to T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>thes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But is it as certain, that the popish Clergy in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelwolf's</hi>
time was chosen and ordained by God, as
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Priests were? And is it as certain, that
Tythes were appointed by Christ for the Maintenance
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Christian</hi> Ministers, as it is that they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God for the Maintenance of the <hi>Iewish</hi>
Priests? He might d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> well to observe a Difference
between the states of Law and Gospel. God then
chose that whole Nation to be his peculiar People:
hath he ever chose a whole Nation to be his peculiar
People since? Nay, Hath he not chose himself a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
People out of all Nations, Kindreds, Tongues
and Peoples, picking here one and there one, one of
a Tribe and two of a Family? Out of that People
he separated one entire Tribe to the service of the
Tabernacle, who in a natural and lineal Succession
were appointed to carry on and continue that Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
to the end of that Polity: but under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
it is not so. His Argument therefore from the
Example of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Priests will not hold. But if
<hi>Ethelwolf</hi> and the People ought to have given and
paid Tythes as God's Due to that Clergy, <hi>though
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rroneous,</hi> then surely he and they were unjust in not
giving them sooner, and so were also his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors:
for, if as God's Due they ought to have given
them at all, they ought then to have given them from
the first, and upon that Supposition were guilty of
Sacriledge in detaining them, which the Priest it
may be did not fore-see when he called <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> a
<hi>Religious and Mild Prince,</hi> pag. 95. a <hi>Good King,</hi>
pag. 107. and the <hi>Clergy's B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nefactor,</hi> pag. 109.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:65611:122"/>
But to what end doth he argue the <hi>validity</hi> of the
Donotion from the <hi>ignorance</hi> of the Donors, saying, <hi>If
the Clergy were erroneous, neither Prince nor People knew
it, &amp;c.</hi> seeing it had been all one if they had known it.
For if <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> ought to have given Tythes to that
Clergy, &amp; the people ought to have paid them, though
that Clergy were erroneous, what odds had there been
if both Prince and People had known them to be er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous?
They must it seems have given and paid
them Tythes howev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r. How ill do these two peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods
agree! In the first he says, <hi>Though that Cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rgy
were erroneous, yet</hi> Ethelwolf <hi>ought to have given them
God's Due, and the people ought to have paid it to them.</hi>
In the second he says, <hi>The Donation is therefore good,
because if they were erronious, neither Prin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e nor Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
knew it.</hi> Thus one while, their ignorance of the
Clergy's Errors, and belief that they were a good
Ministry, makes the Donation of Tythes to them
good. Another while, though they were errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
yet the Prince ought to give them, and the
people ought to pay them: What would it have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed

            <p>I verily believe it indeed, and withal, that those
Ministers whom God hath now provided for himself,
neither do nor dare receive Tythes. And though he

given unto them, and keep them for themselves. The

did <hi>well</hi> and very <hi>commendably:</hi> but their taking
Tythes from the <hi>popish</hi> Clergy to themselves <hi>is their
blemish,</hi> and will be so long as they retain them.</p>
            <p>§. 14. <hi>The third Objection which the Priest gives
in my Name is this,</hi> That <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> granted this
Charter for Tythes upon evil Motives. For the Good
of our Souls, and the Forgiveness of our Sins, are the
words of the Charter; which shews it to be an effect of
that <hi>popish</hi> Doctrine of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>riting Salvation by good
works; and that he gave this as an expiation for his
Sins. <hi>Upon this he says, pag.</hi> 105. 'Tis somewhat
strange that <hi>T. E.</hi> should reckon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oth these for evil Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
and it is the first time that I ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r heard it called
an evil Motive, to be moved to do a good work, for
the Good of our Souls.</p>
            <p>'Tis very strange this Priest should think to <hi>avoid</hi>
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orce of the Objection by a <hi>Quibble</hi> only. To
be moved to do a Good Work <hi>simply,</hi> is not an Evil
Motive; but to be moved to do a good work <hi>as an

                  </gap>tion for Sin,</hi> or with an expectation of <hi>meriting
Salvation thereby,</hi> is an evil Motive.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>(says the Priest)</hi> The desire of Remission of his
Sins was a good Motive in it self, only he took an ill course
to obtain it, if he sought expiation by Good Works, <hi>ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Desire of Remission of his Sins was a good
Desire; but what was it a Motive to? If it was a

But as if the Priest thought it not enough to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi>
my words, and fasten on them a suggestion by

            <p>But who is he that looks for Salvation by his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection?
<hi>The</hi> Quaker <hi>does not:</hi> who does? It is one
thing to <hi>believe Perfection attainable,</hi> to aim <hi>at</hi> it,
and press after it, but it is another thing to <hi>look for
Salvation by it.</hi> Patience, Humility, Meekness,
Temperance, <hi>Charity,</hi> and other <hi>Christian</hi> vertues
are not only <hi>desirable,</hi> but (I suppose he'l grant) <hi>attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
But must they who <hi>seek after</hi> and <hi>obtain</hi> these
Vertues, needs look for Salvation <hi>by</hi> them? it is no

<hi>useless,</hi> when <hi>he attributes the remission of his Sins to
Christ's Death?</hi> If any one sayes his Sins are remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
when they are not, he is to blame and deceives
himself. If any one expects remission of Sins by any
<hi>other</hi> way then the death of Christ, he renders the

death of Christ useless. But surely, he that in Truth

            </p>
            <p>But whether <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> were a <hi>Papist</hi> or no, it is

in affirming they were acted by evil motives. And yet</hi>
(sayes he) <hi>if all these had been as true as they are false,
it had been hurtful only to themselves, but doth not at all
make their pious Donations of Tythes to God and his
Ministers to be void,</hi> pag. 109. What <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> was,
who gave Tythes, <hi>(viz.</hi> first <hi>a Monk in Orders,</hi> then
<hi>absolved from his Vows by the Pope,</hi> a great <hi>Benefactor</hi>

him to give Tythes (viz. <hi>to obtain thereby Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

<hi>Popish Priests and Monks, corrupt</hi> in Doctrine, <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi>
in Practice, <hi>corrupt</hi> in Life, <hi>corrupt</hi> in Manners.)

to be <hi>Papists</hi> that held them, I leave to the Readers
judgment. Many more instances might be given to
shew how foully the Church of that Age was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
with the <hi>Romish Leprosie;</hi> but these I take to be
sufficient to satisfie any <hi>true Protestant.</hi> And indeed
to what purpose were it to add more, when the Priest
here sayes, That <hi>if all this had been true</hi> (that they
that gave Tythes had been <hi>Papists,</hi> and the Clergy
to whom they gave them had been <hi>Popish,</hi> and the
motives on which they gave them had been Evil) <hi>yet
it had been hurtful only to themselves, but doth not at

<hi>bad</hi> that gave, be they <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> to whom they
gave, be the motives <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> which iuduced them
to give, he regards none of all this; 'tis the <hi>Gift</hi> he

this Nation then had to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>

to learn the Song of one <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Festamps,</hi> and
to sing it in the Church, which to do when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
as they that had been ever used not only in

the manner of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, sudainly on a day

&amp;c. and so goes on to relate the <hi>Skirmish</hi>
which being beside my purpose, I omit, and only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
from these Testimonies, first, that this <hi>Roman
Mass,</hi> instituted by <hi>Gregory</hi> and bearing his Name,
and by Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> &amp; his <hi>Roman</hi> Council appointed
to be used in all places, was received and used here
<hi>in England</hi> before the Conquest; secondly, that the

but in <hi>other</hi> service of the Church to follow the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> thirdly, that this <hi>Missal</hi>
of <hi>Gregory,</hi> thus by decree of Council made <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal,</hi>
and then received and used here <hi>in England,</hi> was
in substance <hi>the same</hi> that was used afterwards, both
<hi>here</hi> and elsewhere untill the time of Reformation;
<hi>Fox</hi> saying expresly, that <hi>Gregory's</hi> Service had only
the place, and <hi>yet hath to this day</hi> in the greatest part
of <hi>Europe.</hi> But that the Reader may the better
judge whether these Masses were such <hi>innocent</hi> things
as the Priest doth here represent them, whether the
Priests that said them were the <hi>right Ministers</hi> of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:65611:129"/>
God, as pag. 112. he makes no doubt they were;
whether the People that used them were <hi>nearer in O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
to the</hi> Protestant <hi>Church of</hi> England then to the

And whether if they were so, it is not <hi>greatly to be

(sayes he) The Lord's Supper was celebrated in a
most plain manner. 2<hi>dly,</hi> It was increased with
Ceremonies, and first with Oblations for the Dead,
which was a gratulation or thanksgiving for them,
and this was two Hundred Years after Christ. 3<hi>dly,</hi>
Prayers for the Dead were added about the Year
400. Then Purgatory, and Redemption of Souls
out of Purgatory by Masses. Then about the Year
780. <hi>Gregoryes</hi> Mass began to be used in the
Churches of <hi>Italy,</hi> where before the Liturgy of

               <hi>Again, sayes the Author of the</hi> Right of Tythes <hi>to
his Brother Priest,</hi> Whereas you had said, Tythes were
given to God for the Maintenace of his Ministry, <hi>T. E.</hi>
interprets this to be a calling the idolatrous Priesthood of
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> Gods Ministers, which <hi>(says h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>)</hi>
is a malicious and false Inference, since the Priesthood
to whose Maintenance Tythes were given, was neither
Idolatrous nor the Priesthood of the Church of <hi>Rome,
pag.</hi> 111.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:65611:131"/>
The Inference is neither malicious not false; but
plain and true. These Priests, both one and t'other,
affirm that Priesthood to whose Maintenance <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wolf</hi>
gave Tythes, to be God's Ministry. I have
proved they were a <hi>Popish</hi> Priesthood by the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of divers approved Authors, by the tenour
of the Charter it self, and by the Definition the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Priest gave of <hi>Popery,</hi> viz. <hi>That it is such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
and superstitious Practices, which by the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of time have prevailed in the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the true, antient, catholick and apostolick Church.</hi>
I have shewed at large that those Priests, to whose
Maintenance <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> granted Tythes, did hold and
use <hi>such Doctrine</hi> and <hi>superstitious Practices,</hi> as by
the corruption of time have prevailed in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to the true, antient, catholick and
apostolick Church, of which I have given ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
I have also proved <hi>that Priesthood Popish</hi> by
the assertion of this latter Priest my present Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
who in his <hi>Right of Tythes,</hi> pag. 99. saye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>The Benefit of this Donation hath been enjoyed for eight
hundred years by those to whom the Donation was made,</hi>
which must of necessity be understood of <hi>popish
Priests,</hi> otherwise the Assertion is <hi>utterly false.</hi> For
he is a meer Stranger to History, who doth not know,
that from <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s time until the Reformation,
which in this Nation began little more then a hundred
years ago, <hi>Romish Superstitions,</hi> Corruptions and <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries,</hi>
encreased daily and prevailed, and the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Clergy</hi> in every Age grew <hi>more devoted</hi> to the
Observance of the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> Now when I have
so fully proved that <hi>that was a popish Priesthood</hi> to
whose Maintenance King <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> gave Tythes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and yet these Priests plainly affirm that, <hi>that Priest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:65611:132"/>
hood was God's Ministry,</hi> what inference can be more
plain and true, then that they call that <hi>idolatrous
Priesthood</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> God's Ministers?
This Priest sayes, pag. 102. <hi>The Clergy of that Ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was God's only publick Ministers;</hi> and pag. 99. <hi>The
benefit of the Donation had been enjoyed for eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years by those to whom the Donation was made.</hi>
The Donation was made in the year eight hundred
fifty five, to which 800 years of enjoyment being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
brings to the year one thousand, six hundred, fifty
five: I desire thee Reader to compare these two
sayings of this Priest together, and to examin well
the account of time, and then judge whether this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Priest, who cryes out so vehemently against me
for inferring that the other Priest call'd th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> idolatrous
Priesthood of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> God's Ministers,
calling it a malicious and false inference; doth not
himself call that <hi>idolatrous Priesthood</hi> of the Church
of <hi>Rome, God's own publick Ministers.</hi> When he
sayes, <hi>The Clergy of that Age, to whom this Donation
of Tythes was made, was God's only publick Ministers,</hi>
and that <hi>the Benefit of this Donation was enjoyed for
eight hundred years by those to whom the Donation was
made,</hi> doth it not clearly follow that he accounts <hi>all
the popish Clergy</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in the <hi>blackest</hi> and <hi>bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diest</hi>
times of <hi>Popery,</hi> even <hi>Bonner</hi> himself and his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rethren, God's only publick Ministers, who were
indeed the <hi>publick Ministers of Antichrist,</hi> and the
greatest <hi>Enemies of God?</hi> Nay, he adds, pag. 112.
<hi>It is certain the Donors intended them</hi> (viz. Tythes)
<hi>to the right Ministers of God; and I make no doubt</hi>
(sayes he) <hi>they were such to whom they gave them;
and they to whom they were given enjoyed</hi> (sayes he,
pag. 99.) <hi>the benefit thereof for eight hundred years.</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:65611:132"/>
What's the Consequent? That he makes no doubt
they were the right Ministers of Christ, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
the Tythes for eight hundred years after <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelwolf,</hi>
which comprehends the Popish Priesthood
in its most filthy and poluted state. Can any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
this Priest to be himself a Minister of Christ?
Let him clear himself hereof if he can, and shew
how the Benefit of this Donation of Tythes was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
for eight hundred years <hi>by any Priesthood that
was not Popish and Idolatrous.</hi>

<hi>p. 12. bestows here again on me his</hi> usual <hi>Rhetorick of</hi>

this man, could he once but have got them into possession
<hi>To this the latter Priest sayes, pag.</hi> 113. Were these
given to the true God? or were these Offerings Tythes?
If they were not both of these, why doth this <hi>Quaker</hi>
mention them here?</p>
            <p>To justifie <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s Donation of Tythes to the
Popish Clergy, the Priest often urges the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Donors, as pag. 103. <hi>The Donors sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
them a good Ministry, and as such endowed them;
for they esteemed them to be God's Receivers.</hi> Again,
pag. 112. <hi>It is certain the Donors intended them to
the right Ministers of God.</hi> And pag. 104. <hi>They
gave Tythes to maintain that which they believed to be
a good Ministry, and the true Worship of God; and
therefore the Donation remains good.</hi> Here its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
he makes the <hi>validity</hi> of the Donation to depend
upon the <hi>Intention</hi> of the Donors. But when the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> offered to their <hi>Heathenish</hi> Deities did they
not suppose and believe those Deities to be <hi>true</hi> Gods,
and the Priests of those Deities to be a <hi>good</hi> and a
<hi>right</hi> Priesthood? and did not some of them offer
<hi>Tythes</hi> also, as the Priest has tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n some needless
pains to prove? Now if as he argues pag. 104. The
Donation <hi>therefore</hi> remains good, because the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
gave Tythes to maintain that which <hi>they believed</hi>
to be a good Ministry, and the true Worship of
God (although in very deed it was a <hi>bad</hi> Ministry,

way of Worship, they may be applied to maintain a right
way of Worship; but still they must remain sacred?</hi> But
the other Priest hath since cleared the case: for in his

               </gap>. pag. 314. he sayes, <hi>Suppose the</hi> Turkish <hi>Empir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>calls</hi> Emaums <hi>together with all the Mosks and Revenues

What therefore I observed from the words of the
former Priest, is confirmed and proved by them both;
and no imputation of <hi>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>honesty</hi> or <hi>ignorance,</hi> can be
justly charged on me therein. But he taxes me with
<hi>impudence, in calling that a general Assertion which</hi>
(he sayes) <hi>had three limitations, Tythes, the true
God, and the Maintenance of his Ministry.</hi> pag. 113.</p>
            <p>But he might have taken notice, that I call'd his
Assertion <hi>general</hi> with relation to those words <hi>[No

be the Blemishes in the Dedication <hi>never so many,
never so great, never so foul,</hi> yet with them it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

I will stand to</hi> (sayes the last Priest) <hi>and make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:65611:134"/>
That such things as Tythes are, being given to
the true God for a good end,</hi> NO BLEMISH <hi>in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
can alter their property.</hi> This he undertakes
to prove by the instance of the Censers offered by
<hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ah's</hi> company, pag. 114. And he blames me for
observing what a pretty Parallel the other Priest had
found out, and how well he had match't his case, in
bringing <hi>this rebellious Consecration, att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nded with a
damnable Sin, to Parallel the dedication of Tythes.</hi>
But doubtless he that shall well consider it will find he
has by this Parallel rather <hi>hurt</hi> then <hi>help't, disgraced</hi>
then <hi>credited</hi> his Cause. <hi>It is the difference,</hi> he sayes,
<hi>between these two Cases, that makes the Argument
good.</hi> Why then did he call it a <hi>parallel</hi> case? Is this
case <hi>parallel</hi> to his, and yet doth his Argument re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
its strength <hi>not</hi> from the <hi>parity</hi> but the <hi>dispari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
or <hi>difference</hi> of the case? that's strange indeed:
where was his <hi>Logick,</hi> and <hi>common sense,</hi> when he
writ that! He quarrels also at the reason given why
those Censers were commanded to be kept, namely,
<hi>To be a sign and memorial to the Children of</hi> Israel,
<hi>that no s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

their being hollowed; <hi>the</hi> particular <hi>Reason was,</hi> that
they might be a Sign and Memorial unto the Children

<hi>Reason doth</hi> not exclude <hi>the</hi> particular, <hi>any more

also concurs with him in his Vindication, pag. 304,

may patronize this Donation of Tythes. In the
time of the Law, among the Vessels and Utensils of
the Tabernacle, <hi>Censers</hi> had a place and service <hi>by

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssels were not to be put to any prophane or
common use. Yet had not those Vessels any <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick</hi>

<hi>temporal</hi> sanctity, as Vessels <hi>set apart</hi>

               </gap>or that service.
But when that Service was at an end, that Temple
forsaken, that Worship, and all its dependencies,
laid aside, those Vessel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

less should Tythes;</hi> He argues <hi>fallaciously:</hi> for it doth
not follow, that because the <hi>Censers</hi> might not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated
<hi>then, Tythes</hi> should not be alienated <hi>now.</hi> But
as, if the <hi>Censers dedicated under the Law</hi> might not
be alienated <hi>then,</hi> neither might Tythes be alienated
<hi>then:</hi> So if <hi>Censers</hi> dedicated <hi>under the Gospel,</hi> may be
alienated <hi>now, Tythes</hi> dedicated <hi>under the Gospel,</hi> may
in like manner be alienated <hi>now.</hi> This he cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void,
if he grant that <hi>Censers</hi> and other Vessels of
the <hi>Iewish</hi> Worship dedicated under the Gospel, <hi>may
be alienated:</hi> But if he do not grant this, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

For if it be in man's power to dedicate <hi>what he pleases</hi>
to God, and the thing so dedicated must be reputed
<hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>separate</hi> to a Religious use, what bar is there
to hinder the bringing in <hi>of all the</hi> Jewish <hi>Ceremonies?</hi>
In short, The hallowed Censers not being aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
then (in the time of the Law) shew that Tythes
might not be alienated then (in the time of the Law)
but it doth not prove that Tythes might <hi>never</hi> be alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
any more then it proves that Censers might
never be alienated, but must remain separated to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
uses to the World's End. Though Censers offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:65611:136"/>
in the time of the Law, when they were in use
by divine appointment, were hallowed, and not alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to common uses; yet <hi>after that Law was abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,</hi>
and the use of Censers ended, the offering of
Censers would <hi>not</hi> have hallowed them, but they
might notwithstanding such Oblation be put to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
uses. And if the offering of Censers <hi>then</hi> will
not patronize the offering of Censers <hi>now,</hi> nor their
being hallowed <hi>then</hi> infer their being hallowed <hi>now;</hi>
to be sure the offering and hallowing of Censers <hi>then</hi>
will not justifie the offering and hallowing of Tythes
<hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w;</hi> nor the unlawfulness of alienating those hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
Censers <hi>then,</hi> infer it unlawful to alienate
Tythes <hi>now.</hi> The offering of Censers <hi>then,</hi> while
that Worship stood to which they served, will no
more authorize any to dedicate Tythes <hi>now,</hi> when
that <hi>Priesthood is ended</hi> to which they did peculiarly
belong, then it will warrant the offering of Censers
<hi>now,</hi> when that Worship to which they served <hi>is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
Neither doth it any more follow, that because the
Censers then offered were hallowed, and might not

talks of, <hi>may safely be alienated to common uses.</hi> And

<q>It was (saith <hi>Andrew Willet</hi> in his <hi>Synopsis of Popery,</hi>

            <p>§. 18. <hi>In his next Section, pag. 117. he charges
me with</hi> exasperating the Impropriators against the
Priests, and endeavouring to get them on my side; <hi>which
is altogether false. I am not so tender of the</hi> Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priators
<hi>Right (as he suggests) as not believing the
Impropriators</hi> have any Right <hi>to the Tythes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man's Crop; It is notorious enough that the</hi>
Quakers <hi>suffer by</hi> Impropriators <hi>as well as by</hi> Priests;
<hi>and my Argument lies</hi> against both. <hi>But he that shall
read that place in my Book which the Priest hath
quoted, pag. 297. may plainly see my aim is to
shew, that even according to the</hi> Priest's <hi>Argument,
the</hi> Impropriators have no right to Tythes. <hi>My words
are,</hi> It is obvious, that if because Tythes have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:65611:137"/>
               <hi>(as he sayes)</hi> to God, it is unlawful to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
them to common uses, then it must needs be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for them to hold their Impropriations, because they
were offered in like manner as the rest of the Tythes were.
But <hi>(say I there)</hi> let them look to themselves. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be</hi> flattering <hi>and</hi> cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing <hi>the Impropriators
(as he unhandsomly suggests) let the Reader judge.
Then for those Lands given to</hi> Abbies <hi>and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Houses (as they were once called) and upon
the dissolution of those Houses settled on the</hi> Crown,
<hi>it is manifest his Argument</hi> impeaches <hi>that settlement,
and all the subequent Tittles to those Lands derived
therefrom, and aims at reducing those Lands into the</hi>
Clergyes hands <hi>again. For if, as he argues,</hi> being once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
they cannot be alienated to common use; <hi>and that</hi>
it is a dangerous thing to medle with any thing that hath
given been to God, Fr. Confer. <hi>pag. 147. And again,</hi> as
the Censers being once given to God, must remain to be his
still,—so we may learn it ought to be in other sacred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications,
—they must remain sacred still, <hi>Right of
Tythes, pag. 117. Then seeing these</hi> Abbey Lands
<hi>were once dedicated to God as well as</hi> Tythes, <hi>it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
unavoidably from his Argument, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be alienated to common uses, but must remain sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
still. Thus we see at once both the aim of his</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiable
<hi>Eye, and the</hi> weakness <hi>of his Argument, which
in my former Book, pag. 297. is detected at large,
and the discovery thereof hath so</hi>

acquit himself. <hi>For if he will infer from my reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that</hi> I deny the Impropriators Right to Tythes,
<hi>which I readily enough acknowledge I do, yet what
is that to</hi> his Iustification, <hi>whose Argument (if true)

18. 11.) we do not (like the <hi>Quakers</hi>) take upon us to
censure the actions of our Princes and Parliaments,—
Whatever Opinions the Priests hold in this matter, they
do not oppose the Laws, and go about to perswade any
to take away the Impropriators Estates from them. <hi>Do
they not? Pray hear now what the Author of the

<hi>judge now. Reader, the truth of that saying of the
other Priest [viz.</hi> We do not take upon us to censure
the Actions of our Princes and Parliament] <hi>when
this Priest charges</hi> Henry 8. <hi>and his Parliament with</hi>
downright Sacriledge. <hi>He might have considered,
that how</hi> ill <hi>a Friend soever</hi> Henry 8. <hi>was to</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
<hi>he was not so</hi> ill <hi>a Friend to Tythes, as the

for the payment of Tythes was made under his
Reign.</p>
            <p>But further, sayes the Author of the Right of
Tythes, pag. 118. <hi>We do not pretend Conscience to save
charges, as the</hi> Quakers <hi>manner is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doth he know any <hi>Quaker</hi> that pretends Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to save charges? If he does know any such, I
desire he will <hi>name him.</hi> But if he knows no such, what
has he told? If he would needs <hi>raise a Slander</hi> on
the <hi>Quakers,</hi> could he find nothing that would have
look't more likely? Do not the <hi>Quakers</hi> know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand, that if they refuse to pay Tythe, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
the penalty of treble dammage, which by that
time it is levied, seldom comes to less then five or six

so much beside his Wits, as to receive a suggestion so
utterly repugnant to common sense and reason, as
this is? But to proceed.</p>
            <p>§. 19. The Priest is troubled that Tythes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
of <hi>Popis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them <hi>if he knew how.</hi> He tryes all the wayes he can,
and leaves no Stone unturned. His first attempt is to
<hi>defame me,</hi> that my discourse might have the less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance:
In order whereunto he tells his Reader,
pag. 120. <hi>T. E. now falls to work for the Iesuits in good
earnest, labouring to make out the Pope's Title to</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<hi>by a Prescription of eight or nine Hundred Years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this he is very faulty: for (besides his having
represented me all along as a meer piece of Ignorance
and Folly, and thereby rendred me a very unfit A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to carry on the deep designs of those crafty and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:65611:139"/>
politick Statists) he knows full well, that I labour
not to make the Pope a Title to <hi>England;</hi> but to
<hi>raize out</hi> all Monuments of his <hi>usurped</hi> Authority,
that no <hi>print</hi> nor Foot-step may appear of his power
having been exercised here by the <hi>continuance</hi> of any
<hi>Custom</hi> which received either life or growth from him,
<hi>as this of Tythes did.</hi> And since it may be <hi>lamented,</hi>
but cannot be <hi>denyed,</hi> that the Papal Authority hath
had <hi>too long</hi> as well as <hi>too great</hi> a sway here; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I pray doth best become a <hi>Protestant,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
freely its <hi>full time,</hi> and <hi>reject fully all its
Institutions;</hi> or to <hi>mince</hi> the matter, represent the

set up any thing apparently and <hi>avowedly Popish.</hi>
Therefore the Enemy of <hi>true</hi> Religion invents other
wayes <hi>to keep up</hi> Popish <hi>Institutions,</hi> and one is to

                  </gap>dent</hi> to <hi>Popery.</hi> But he
that shall duly consider the state of the Church, in
and from the Apostles times, will find that the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Iniquity,</hi> which began to work in their dayes,
hath continued working <hi>ever since,</hi> and in every Age
successively hath brought forth <hi>more and more</hi> of its
work. So that <hi>Popery</hi> was not <hi>All</hi> brought forth in
a Day, nor in an Age, but was introduced <hi>gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi>
And as the <hi>true</hi> Religion of Christ was insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
prosessed and practised some time <hi>before</hi> it was
distinguished by the Name <hi>Christian.</hi> So the <hi>false</hi>
Religion was received also <hi>before</hi> it was denominated
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:65611:139"/>
               <hi>Popish:</hi> yet this false Religion was really <hi>in its N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Popish,</hi> before it obtained to be called <hi>Popish,</hi> as
the true Religion was really <hi>in its Nature Christian,</hi>
before it received the Name <hi>Christian.</hi> He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that will receive whatsoever he finds practised or
commended in the Church <hi>before</hi> the Name of <hi>Popery</hi>
prevailed, may be very likely to receive something
which was brought forth by the working of the <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Iniquity,</hi> and is really and truly <hi>of the Nature
of</hi> Popery.</p>
            <p>But the Priest sayes (as he has said before, more
then once) <hi>If the</hi> Saxons <hi>in K.</hi> Ethelwolf's <hi>ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e were</hi>
Papists, <hi>it will not follow that all their Donations are
void.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say so too. Some of their Donations were <hi>meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
civil,</hi> made by them as men and <hi>Members of a civil
Society;</hi> but this of Tythes was the product of their
<hi>Religion,</hi> and of that part of it wherein they were
<hi>most corrupt.</hi> So that although <hi>All</hi> their Donations
are not void, yet if <hi>any at all</hi> of their Donations are
void, there is none which with more reason should
be so then <hi>this of Tythes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again he sayes,</hi> Suppose they were <hi>Papists</hi> in some
things, yet it follows not that giving Tythes was a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi>
Act; for all the Acts of <hi>Papists</hi> are not Popish.</p>
            <p>But I have proved that the <hi>giving of Tythes was a</hi>
Popish <hi>Act,</hi> proceeding from such Motives, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with such Circumstances as are <hi>repugnant to
true</hi> Protestant <hi>Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But sayes he, pag.</hi> 121. The <hi>Protestants</hi> have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
as much and as well for Tythes, as ever the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
did.</p>
            <p>If by <hi>Protestants</hi> he means his Brethren the Priests,
I wonder not at all at it: <hi>Tythes are their</hi> Diana, <hi>the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:65611:140"/>
Oyl that nourishes their Lamp,</hi> pag. 13. No wonder
then if <hi>they dispute</hi> fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Tythes, and that <hi>much</hi> too,
but <hi>how well</hi> let others judge. Yet commonly the
Dispute ends on their parts with <hi>Club-Law,</hi> and in
the case of Tythes an <hi>Imprisonment</hi> and <hi>trebble dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages</hi>
are <hi>Ratio ultima Cleri, the Clergy's last Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and many times their <hi>first</hi> too, but alwayes

            <p>
               <hi>He adds,</hi> It is a <hi>Popish</hi> Opinion, That the Bishop
of <hi>Rome</hi> can exempt men from paying Tythes.</p>
            <p>'Tis so indeed: but it is the subsequent of another

men</hi> to pay Tythes. So that the particular exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from Tythes and the institution of Tythes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ived
from <hi>one and the same Power.</hi> And if the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Tythes had not been settled and established
by the Authority of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his power to exempt men from paying Tythes
had not prevailed as it did. But do not these <hi>Popish</hi>
exemptions remain still among the <hi>Protestants?</hi> Those
Lands which the Pope made <hi>Tythe free,</hi> are they not
<hi>Tythe free still?</hi> What signifies that I pray? Is that
an argument of the <hi>divine Right of Tythes?</hi> and that
Tythes are due by the <hi>moral eternal Law?</hi> Or is
it not rather a <hi>fair intimation,</hi> that Tythes are indeed
but of <hi>human</hi> Institution, and that from the Bishops
of <hi>Rome</hi> too? whose exemptions are in force, and
observed here, even to this day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then he sayes,</hi> I begun too low by far; for if <hi>Popery</hi>
came not into the Church, till about seven Hundred
Years after Christ (according to <hi>T. E's</hi> proof) then
Tythes were much ancienter then Popery; for they
were paid <hi>(sayes he)</hi> and declared to be due to the
Church at least five Hundred Years before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:65611:140"/>
In all this he is wrong. For first, I have proved
<hi>Popery</hi> did come into the Church <hi>before</hi> seven Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years after Christ, &amp; <hi>before</hi> any settled payment
of Tythes. Next, he neither hath proved, nor can
prove by any Testimony of credit in this case, that
Tythes were paid and declared to be due to the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Church at least five Hundred Years before. He
may talk of the <hi>Apostles Canons</hi> and <hi>Clement's Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
and be laugh't at for his pains: but no Authentick
evidence of <hi>those times</hi> can be produced to prove the
payment of Tythes. The oldest of his Authors that
mentions Tythes is <hi>Origen;</hi> who grounded his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

that <hi>that Law should stand in force according to the
Letter,</hi> which could not be consistent with <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
But although <hi>Origen</hi> was a learned man, yet
<hi>Perkins</hi> says he was <hi>Errorum plenus,</hi> full of Errors;
and <hi>Hierom</hi> calls his Writings, <hi>Ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and among the rest of his Errors <hi>Purgatory was one,</hi>

pag. 175. So that if he will fetch Tythes from <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,
he may take Purgatory along with them,</hi> if he
please. However, he shall find that some of those
Opinions which afterwards were most rightly deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated

there is the more Reason to believe this Decree of

Hom. 13. upon <hi>Numb.</hi> Pope <hi>Syricius</hi> himself in
an Epistle to <hi>Hymerius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tarracon,</hi> says, that
<q>They who are in the Flesh, that is, they who are

in an Epistle to <hi>Anastatius,</hi> says, <q>To set forth the
purity of perfect Continency, Marriage is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
so much as to Sub-Deacons.</q> By all which it
appears, that Priests Marriages were denyed and
forbidden in <hi>those early Ages</hi> of the Church, the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery

<hi>before Ethelwolf</hi>'s Charter for Tythes was granted.
And as the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> somewhat after the
year 1200. was the first that made Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an <hi>Article of Faith;</hi> so the same Council of
<hi>Lateran</hi> was the <hi>first general</hi> Council that decreed

               </gap>rochial Right to Tythes, as <hi>Selden</hi> proves in his
History of Tythes, ch. 6. §. 7. and ch. 10. §. 2.
towards the end. So that the general parochial pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Tythes, and the general belief of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation,
were decreed and established <hi>at one and
the same time, in one and the same</hi> General Council.</p>
            <p>Purgatory it self <hi>(he sayes)</hi> was but a private O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,

both lived about two hundred years after Christ.</q>
That it was held by <hi>Augustin</hi> also, and <hi>others of the
Fathers,</hi> though in somewhat a different Notion
from what it afterward obtained, he shews, p. 176,

            <p>That many, if not most of these were believed,
and publickly held in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> long before
<hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s time, is undoubted. Concerning the

And of <hi>Confession</hi> he sayes, pag. 180. <q>Confessio au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

i. e. <hi>Auricular Confession, that is, particular Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of all mortal sins, held necessary for the obtaining
Remission of them, and which is made in private to the
Priest, began to be enforced &amp; commanded in the Church
about eight hundred years after Christ</hi> (which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
fifty years before <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s Charter.) And
of <hi>Invocation of Saints,</hi> he sayes, pag. 89. <q>No In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
of the Dead can be shewed in the Church
for three hundred and fifty years after Christ.</q> Then
p. 90. he says, <q>This Invocation began to be brought
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:65611:145"/>
into the use of the Catholick Church about the year
380. by common Custome and private Devotion.</q>
And pag. 91. he affirms, that <q>After the year 400.
the antients did commit Sin, yea, and were guilty
of Sacriledge in the Invocation of Saints;</q> of which
he gives many Instances full of gross Impiety, and
then adds, pag. 94. <q>The Invocation which in former
Ages was of private Devotion began to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
about the year 500. for then <hi>Petrus Gnaphaeus</hi>
mingled the Invocation of Saints with the publick
Prayers of the Church. For he is said to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
this, that in every Prayer the Mother of
God should be named, and her divine Name called
upon. And about the year 600. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the
great commanded a <hi>Letany,</hi> which was made for the
Invocation of Saints,</q> to be sung publickly.</p>
            <p>Thus we see that these Doctrines, which he sayes
are properly called <hi>Popery,</hi> were received, held, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
and publickly professed many a year <hi>before</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelwolf
<hi>was born.</hi> And were it not to avoid pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixity,
I could make it evident, that the <hi>greatest part</hi>
of the Errors, Corruptions, Superstitions and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> were received, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
and openly maintained <hi>long before Ethelwolf</hi>
made his Donation of Tythes. But suppose the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
he has instanced were not <hi>determined</hi> as Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith in <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s time, but without any
such <hi>formal Determination</hi> were received and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
believed, are they <hi>therefore</hi> not <hi>popish?</hi> Doth
Popery lie <hi>only in the Determination</hi> of them? If they
are <hi>Errors,</hi> if they are <hi>Corruptions,</hi> if they are <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions,</hi>
if they are <hi>Idolatries, after</hi> they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
as Articles of Faith, then surely they were
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:65611:145"/>
such <hi>before,</hi> else the <hi>bare</hi> determination of them
would not have made them such. Besides, if there
were Truth in what he sayes, that the particulars he
has mentioned had not been determined as Articles
of Faith before <hi>Ethelwolf's</hi> time, nor could have
been <hi>Popish</hi> without such a determination; yet very
many <hi>other</hi> Instances may be given of Doctrines and
Practices <hi>properly Popish,</hi> sufficient to prove not the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in general <hi>only,</hi> but the then Church
of <hi>England also</hi> (which was a Member of that, and
for at least seven continued Successions, received her
Metropolitan Bishop out of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church) to
be Popish, according to the Definition his Brother
Priest has given of Popery, in his <hi>Friendly Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
pag. 149.</p>
            <p>§. 21. <hi>But to clear those times from the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               </gap>ecretal Epistles to be forged, which first
attributed these Constitutions to those early Popes.</p>
            <p>Is not this a pretty way of replying, to say his <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent
lays not much stress on them?</hi> what may one not
answer after this rate? Next he sayes, <hi>there are some
of them allow'd by the best</hi> Protestants: but which are
they? why did he not distinguish betwixt those he
doth allow, and those he doth not allow? The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
were, <hi>The use of Holy Water to drive away
Devils,</hi> said to be Instituted by <hi>Alexander</hi> the first.
<hi>The Consecration of Chrism once a Year,</hi> by <hi>Fabia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.

Consecrated on the holy Sabbath,</hi> by <hi>Zozimus. That
Processions should be made on Sundayes,</hi> by <hi>Agapetus.
Some of these,</hi> he sayes, <hi>are allowed by the best</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
but which they are he keeps to himself. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he sayes, <hi>All men that understand Antiquity know

               </gap>ayes, that <hi>those Decretal Epistles are forged:</hi> yet

there instanced were in use before</hi> Ethelwolf's <hi>time,</hi> and
therefore <hi>must needs be instituted before.</hi> So that his
exception against the Decretal Epistles is but an idle
shift: for if it should be granted that those Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions
were not made by those <hi>early</hi> Popes to whom
they are attributed, yet certain it is they were made
by Popes <hi>earlier</hi> then <hi>Ethelwolf's</hi> Charter for Tythes;
which is enough to prove that Popery had made her

               </gap> let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p>He offers another Evidence against this deposition
of <hi>Childerick</hi> by the Pope's Authority, which is part
of an Epistle from <hi>Hinc-marus</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Rhemes</hi>
to Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the second, who (he sayes) had
written to him to Excommunicate the King of <hi>France.</hi>
The words he gives thus, <hi>There was never any such
precept before sent from</hi> Rome <hi>to any of my Predecessors,</hi>
pag. 125.</p>
            <p>That might be without any injury to the former
Relation of <hi>Childerick's</hi> being deposed by the Pope.
For <hi>Fox</hi> sayes he was deposed by the Authority of
<hi>Boniface Arch-Bishop of Mentz,</hi> which he received
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:65611:148"/>
from the Pope. Now this <hi>Boniface</hi> had a <hi>power L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine</hi>
from the Pope, and is called by <hi>Burdegalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
the <hi>Apostle of the Germans:</hi> So that it may very
well be that the Pope by <hi>this Legate</hi> of his might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the <hi>French</hi> King, and yet send no precept about
it to the <hi>Arch-Bishop of Rhemes,</hi> who were <hi>Hinc-Marus</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cessors. But however from these
very words of <hi>Hinc-Marus</hi> it is evident, that <hi>Pope A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi>
took upon him to <hi>Excommunicate</hi> the King of
<hi>France,</hi> however he succeeded in it. And from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
clause in the same Epistle there is great ground
to suspect, that he purposed to <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t up another in his stead:
Why else doth <hi>Hinc-Marus,</hi> in the Name of the

Judge now Reader, if himself be not here guilty, of
what he there charges upon me. Hath he not in this
very place evaded a serious Answer by a petty Cavil?
But this is an usual way with him, when he is <hi>hard
set,</hi> and willing to <hi>avoid</hi> the matter. I alledged that
<hi>long before Ethelwolf</hi> was Born, <hi>Popery</hi> had made

<pb n="288" facs="tcp:65611:150"/>
of <hi>strange kind</hi> of Miracles wrought by the <hi>Relicks</hi> of

quotations out of the Ecclesiastical History of
<hi>Beda</hi> the <hi>Saxon.</hi> To which, after his <hi>prophane Iest,</hi>
he replyes, <hi>It is not unlikely but some extraordinary
Miracles might be wrought at the first Conversion of
the</hi> Saxons, <hi>the more easily to Convince that rugged Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and the want of human learning in that Age,
might occasion the credulous reception of more then was
true; and yet we must not condemn them presently for

            <p>He that will take the pains to read <hi>Bede's</hi> History
(particularly his third Book, 2, 11, 13, and 15. Chap.
and his fifth Book, 4. Chap.) may there find relation
of Miracles as <hi>palpably Popish</hi> as any in the <hi>Roman
Legend.</hi> And if it should be granted, that Miracles
were then wrought to Convince that People, it must
be supposed that those Miracle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> (if wrought by the

the <hi>true</hi> Faith and Worship of God, and to establish
them in it. But the Miracles mentioned in those

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Bede's</hi> History to which I have above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd,

of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the <hi>veneration</hi> and <hi>adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of <hi>Relicks</hi> of <hi>Popish</hi> Saints, of the <hi>Wood</hi> of the

all men know to be a part (and a <hi>corrupt</hi> part too) of
the present <hi>Romish</hi> Religion. So that in these things
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Church then appears to have been in the

Now inasmuch as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did pray to

and since it appears by <hi>Bede</hi> and others, that
the Opinion and Belief of the <hi>Saints Intercession</hi> was
received and held by the <hi>Saxons</hi> in those times, what
reason can there be to doubt of the <hi>Saxons praying to
Saints,</hi> as their Intercessors with God? If they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
them <hi>Intercessors at all,</hi> with whom could they
think they interceded but with God? And if they
believed they <hi>interceded with God for them,</hi> what
should hinder their praying to them <hi>as their Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi>
with God? especially seeing that Church from
which they <hi>received</hi> both Doctrine and Discipline
did so. But a passage there is in <hi>Bede's</hi> Eccles. Hist.

the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith, within the space of two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years; who, as they seemed then to have a
certain zeal and devotion to Godward, according
to the leading and teaching that then was: so it
seemeth again to me two things to be wished in
these foresaid Kings; first, that they wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch begun
to erect these Monasteries—had foreseen the
danger, &amp;c.—secondly, that unto this their
Zeal and Devotion had been joyned like Knowledge
and Doctrine in <hi>Christ's</hi> Gospel, especially in the
Article of our free Justification by the Faith of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ; because of the LACK whereof, as well
the Builders and Founders thereof, as they that
were professed in the same, seem both to have run
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:65611:154"/>
the WRONG way, and to have been DECEI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VED.
For albeit in them there was a Devotion
and Zeal of mind,—yet the end and cause of their
Deed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and Buildings cannot be excused, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Rule of Christ's Gospel, for so much
as they did these things seeking MERITS with
God, and for REMEDY of their Souls, and RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MISSION
of their Sins, as may appear testified in
their own Records,</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus he. Whence its
plain that he (who undertook to write an History
of the Acts and Monuments of the Church, and may
well be thought to understand something of those
times as well as this Priest) concluded that although
the <hi>Saxons</hi> in those dayes (whom the Priest so

were Zealous according to the <hi>teaching that
then was,</hi> yet they had not the <hi>true knowledge</hi>
and Doctrine of Christ's Gospel, especially in the
point of <hi>justifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ation,</hi> but for <hi>lack</hi> thereof were <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi>
and ran the <hi>wrong</hi> way, seeking <hi>remedy</hi> of
their <hi>Souls,</hi> and <hi>remission</hi> of their <hi>Sins,</hi> by the <hi>merits</hi>
of their <hi>works.</hi> And for proof that they so did, <hi>Fox</hi>
there sets down the <hi>very same</hi> Charter of <hi>Ethelbald</hi>
which this Priest brings to prove the Right of
Tythes, pag. 94. which Charter being by <hi>Fox</hi> set
down, in the place fore-cited, toward the end of his
second Book, he there adds as followeth, <q>By the
contents hereof, sayes he, may well be understood
(as where he saith, <hi>Pro amore calestis partie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remedio
animae, pro liberatione animae, et absolutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne
delictorum,</hi> &amp;c. i. e. For the love of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Country, for the remedy of my Soul, for
the delivering of my Soul, and for the pardon of
my Sins, &amp;c.) how great the IGNORANCE and
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:65611:155"/>
BLINDNESS of these men, was, who lacking no
Zeal, only LACKED KNOWLEDGE to rule it
withal: seeking their Salvation NOT BY CHRIST
ONLY, but by their OWN DESERVINGS and
MERITORIOUS deeds.</q> And the same <hi>Fox</hi> but
two pages further, entring upon the Reign of King
<hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> sayes, <q>This <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> (as being himself
once muzled in that order) was alwayes good and
devout to Holy and Religious orders, insomuch that
he gave to them the Tythe of all his Goods and

may himself be the better able to judge, whether I

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Priest's next and last instance of the</hi> Saxons
<hi>not being</hi> Papists, <hi>is their</hi> keeping the Canon of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
entire, and rejecting the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> from being
of divine Authority.</p>
            <p>But this <hi>(if they did so)</hi> will not clear them from

            <p>§23. <hi>First, he sayes,</hi> The <hi>Saxons</hi> were more Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
in <hi>SOME</hi> points then <hi>ROME</hi> it self then was.</p>
            <p>A goodly commendation! Was <hi>Rome it self</hi> so
Orthodox then in his account, that he makes her the

               <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tandard</hi> to measure others by? <hi>Rome it self</hi> no doubt
was somewhat less corrupt then then in after Ages
she grew to be; yet he that with an impartial Eye
shall view the state of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church in those
times, will find her <hi>far enough from being Orthodox.</hi>
And if the <hi>Saxon</hi> Church was not in ALL points so
depraved as <hi>Rome it self</hi> then was, yet was she also <hi>too
unsound</hi> in Faith to be reputed Orthodox. But se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>the Saxons,</hi> sayes he, <hi>differed from the present</hi>

            <p>It seems then they are not <hi>one with</hi> the <hi>Protestant</hi>

Ministry, the nature and qualifications whereof if
he rightly understood, he would not think that such
a Ministry hath a <hi>greater liberty</hi> to enjoy a <hi>Popish</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

from known and certain Evil, but even from <hi>every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of Evil;</hi> and not only to avoid the works
of the Flesh, but to <hi>hate even the Garment spotted

with <hi>Popery</hi> then, that their Donations of
Tythes are not fit to be enjoyed by <hi>any</hi> Ministry at

            <p>That the Church then was indeed greatly corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with <hi>Popery,</hi> is evident by the many instances
given of Doctrines and Practices received and held
therein, which beyond all contradiction have <hi>through
the corruption of time prevailed in the Church of</hi> Rome
<hi>contrary to the true, ancient, Catholick and Apostolick
Church:</hi> Nor is it likely it should be otherwise, if we
consider the Constitution of the Church here in those
times. For when <hi>Austin</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> came hither from
<hi>Rome,</hi> and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound some reception here, he sent to the
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:65611:157"/>
Pope for advice and direction how to form, settle,
&amp; govern that Church which he then was gathering;
and <hi>from the Pope</hi> he received Instructions in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
he desired to be informed in. <hi>From the Pope</hi>
he received the Power he here exercised, and the
<hi>Pall</hi> of his Arch-Bishoprick, as his Successors gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
did. And the Religion and Worship which he
brought with him <hi>from Rome,</hi> grew by degrees to
be the <hi>general</hi> Religion and Worship of the Nation.
For although the Profession of <hi>Christianity</hi> had been
in this Island <hi>long before Austin</hi> came hither, yet had
it been much <hi>deprest</hi> by <hi>Heathenism,</hi> and the remains
of it shortly after <hi>extinguished</hi> by <hi>Austin</hi> and his
Sectators. <hi>Austin</hi> being dead, his Successors for a
long time after were such, as the succeding <hi>Popes sent

who shall seriously consider, that many of the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

the Mystery of Iniquity extended no further then
was discovered unto them, or that there was <hi>no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Evil in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but what they
testified against, especially since we find divers things

<hi>Cranmer, Hooper, Ridley,</hi> and other Godly

to <hi>oppose</hi> the Martyrs one to another, and render
them as <hi>clashing and warring</hi> amongst themselves,

to <hi>invalidate</hi> and make the Testimony of others
<hi>utterly void</hi> and of no force, which I am sure does

the</hi> Quaker <hi>should say so, who before declared himself to
be for unmediate teaching, and who,</hi> pag. 229. <hi>assirms,
The very Babes in Christ knew all things.</hi> In the first
part of this <hi>Quirk,</hi> he only playes upon the word
<hi>[Immediate]</hi> which (being opposed to <hi>mediate</hi>
teaching, as <hi>mediate</hi> signifies <hi>means</hi> and <hi>helps)</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of the <hi>inward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

that he might seem to say something, applyes the

to sound, not a teaching <hi>without means</hi> and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

But if he please to be <hi>less disingenuous,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
his own mistake, he will find no incongruity in
my words. In the other part, he does not so much
Carp at me, as Cavil at the Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi> whose the
words are, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2. 18, 20. But if in the fore-going
passage he dealt <hi>not fairly</hi> with me; in the following he
deals <hi>most foully:</hi> for he affirms that I say, pag. 230.
<hi>If the Saints have not the Spirit in them, so as to teach
them all things, they have not the Spirit at all.</hi> These
are not my words (as he that will consult the place,
may see) but an inference of his own, made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to abust me. And the other Priest (in his <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi>
pag. 284.) though he nibbles at the same
passage, yet neither doth he quote it as this Priest
doth, nor charge me with affirming, that If the
Saints have not the Spirit in them, so as to teach them
all things, they have not the Spirit at all: But sayes,
The <hi>Quaker</hi> seems to fancy, that if the Spirit be not
with Believers in this immediate manner, his is not
with them at all. Observe now Reader, how I am
dealt with between these two Priests. One of them
sayes positively, that <hi>I affirm:</hi> The other sayes, <hi>The</hi>

               <hi>This also I reject for a</hi> slander: <hi>Nor do I believe

Grace)</hi> in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, <hi>as the Apostle</hi> Peter <hi>exhorted the Saints,</hi>
2 Pet. 4. 18. <hi>and as</hi> Paul <hi>did the</hi> Colossians, <hi>chap. 1.
ver. 10. But from these</hi> false <hi>Premises he draws this</hi>
lame <hi>Conclusion,</hi> Either therefore he must deny these
Holy men were taught immediately (and then by his
Rule they could have no knowledge in divine things) or
else he must confess Truths were not revealed to them by
degrees.</p>
            <p>But there is no necessity for this. For I will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
those Holy men were taught <hi>immediately</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the <hi>manner of teaching,</hi> not in respect of <hi>time.</hi>
They might be taught by the Spirit of God in their

yet those Truths which they were thus taught might
be revealed to them <hi>by degrees.</hi> The Wind that

<hi>Edward</hi> the sixth dayes, when <hi>Cranmer</hi> himself was

seest thou Reader that what <hi>Hooper</hi> Conscientiously
<hi>scrupled</hi> and refused, as an <hi>offence</hi> and <hi>burden to his
Conscience,</hi> and what <hi>Fox</hi> who wrote the Story af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms

of his Associate Bishops <hi>saw no Evil in;</hi> which
I mention not with any design to <hi>detract</hi> the same of
those worthy men, (whose honour and true excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
stood not so much in <hi>knowing much</hi> (though <hi>much</hi>
they knew) as in being <hi>faithful</hi> to what they knew)
nor to intimate any discordance among them (who I

candor needless, I am in some sort constrained here
to make, to obviate, and if it may be to prevent the
unjust Cavillations of my very disingenuous and
captious Adversaries.) But I therefore instance this
case of Bishop <hi>Hooper,</hi> to manifest, that amongst
such as to be sure were no Renegadoes, but real
Martyrs, <hi>all</hi> the Superstitions and Corruptions of the

or the Testimony of others who have seen and decry'd
it, <hi>less considerable</hi> with those who look through
the <hi>Eye</hi> of <hi>Reason,</hi> not of <hi>interest;</hi> the like is to be
said in the case of Tythes. If <hi>some</hi> of the Martyrs
did not see <hi>Tythes</hi> to be of <hi>Popish</hi> Institution, and
therefore did continue the use of them; that practice
of theirs doth no more prove that Tythes are not of
<hi>Popish</hi> Institution, then their using and wearing the
<hi>pontificial Garments,</hi> doth prove those Garments
were not of <hi>Popish</hi> Institution, which Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi>

which have <hi>flourished</hi> well nigh three Hundred
Years: And so <hi>angry</hi> is he at them, that I speed the

would not meddle with <hi>scurrility,</hi> he here falls down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right

upon me, and sayes, I am <hi>a manifest Lyer in

Language as it <hi>credits not</hi> him that gave it (without

not</hi> me to whom it is given; nor would I have taken
notice of it at all, but to manifest the <hi>temper</hi> of my
Adversary, and the <hi>liberty of nameless Writers.</hi> But
he fathers one part of his calumny upon <hi>Fox,</hi> and
sayes, <hi>Most of these Opposers of Tythes recanted open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and proved Apostates, as Mr.</hi> Fox <hi>himself confesseth.</hi>
But in this he does <hi>Fox</hi> wrong: For, first, he no

them so by the <hi>character</hi> he gave of them. Neither
secondly, doth he confess that <hi>most of them recanted
openly;</hi> for of <hi>Wickliffe</hi> and <hi>Thorp</hi> he mentions <hi>no such

As for <hi>Brute, Fox</hi> doth not tax him with retracting

himself principally to the Gospel of Iesus Christ; and
to the determination of Holy</hi> Kirk, <hi>and to the general
Council<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

surely the <hi>character</hi> which <hi>Fox</hi> gives of <hi>Brute,</hi> and of
the <hi>mighty operation of God's Spirit in him,</hi> doth not
imply he thought <hi>Brute</hi> either an <hi>Apostate,</hi> or <hi>Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado.</hi>
But suppose it had been so, as he <hi>opprobriously</hi>

            </p>
            <p>§. 1. The Author of the <hi>Right of Tythes,</hi> to shew
on what ground our Kings and Parliaments proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in estating Tythes on the Clergy, sets down (pag.

and Predecessors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this was the Rule by which our Kings and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
in the Reformation have settled Tythes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Clergy; then are Tythes <hi>no clearer from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi>
in their <hi>settlement,</hi> then in their <hi>Institution:</hi> for

<hi>Hen.</hi> 7. and so back; then seeing it is certain that
<hi>Hen.</hi> 7. and his Predecessors were <hi>professed Papists,</hi>
and devoted to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that the <hi>Constitutions for the maintenance of the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:65611:172"/>
Church</hi> made by or under them were <hi>fully and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
Popish,</hi> it will follow that <hi>the settlement of
Tythes,</hi> by which the Priests now claim a temporal
Right to them, <hi>was made according to</hi> Popish <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,</hi>
which I think is not for the <hi>credit</hi> of their
Claim.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he sayes,</hi> If I would fairly have disproved this
Temporal Right, I should have shewed there were no
human Laws to estate Tythes on the Church, nor no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
in the Courts of Iustice against any that detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, <hi>&amp;c. pag.</hi> 142.</p>
            <p>That's his mistake. If I had argued <hi>against Fact<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
the way he proposes had not been improper: but
arguing against <hi>his</hi> pretended <hi>Right,</hi> I conceive I
took the <hi>right</hi> method, and am well content to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
it to the sensure of every judicious and impartial
Reader, That they have <hi>Remedies in Courts</hi> against
such as do not give them Tythes, and that <hi>they are
not backward to use those Remedies</hi> to the utmost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Severity and Rigour, is a known and certain
Truth, <hi>confirm'd by the ruin of many an industrious
Family,</hi> and <hi>sealed with the innocent Blood of many a
Conscientious Man, who has dyed a Prisoner at their
Suit for Tythes.</hi> But I hope he will not argue from
<hi>Fact to Right,</hi> and infer that <hi>it ought to be so,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>it is so.</hi> The <hi>Popish</hi> Priests (as I shew'd him in
my former Book, pag. 360.) <hi>had Law on their sides
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and others of another Name, within our
own remembrance, had <hi>Law on their sides</hi> and the
<hi>same</hi> Law too (and were <hi>forward enough</hi> to use it)
by which the present Priests recover Tythes. <hi>Had
these therefore,</hi> will he say, <hi>a right to Tythes?</hi> If he
affirms it, he knows what follows: if he denyes it,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:65611:172"/>
the consequence is plain, That <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>not inseparable.</hi> He sayes, <hi>To contrive by Sophistry
and Probabilities to shew a thing cannot be, which we
see with our Eyes, is to nibble, not dispute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I did not go about to shew that what he <hi>sees</hi> with
his Eyes <hi>cannot be;</hi> but I endeavour'd fairly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Sophistry to prove, that <hi>what he sees with his Eyes</hi>
(in this case) <hi>should not be:</hi> not that it cannot be;
but that it <hi>connot rightly and justly be.</hi> And upon the
Priest's comparing his Right with the Parishioners,
and making them to stand upon the same bottom, I
argued for four or five pages together, shewing the
ground of their Claims to be <hi>different,</hi> the one <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,</hi>
the other <hi>spiritual;</hi> and plainly proving, that
a <hi>temporal</hi> settlement of Tythes <hi>is not sufficient</hi> to
give the Priests a right thereto, because Tythes ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
claimed upon considerations that are <hi>not temporal,</hi> but
spiritual; see <hi>Truth prevailing,</hi> pag. 311, 312,
313, 314, 315. To all which, the Author of the
<hi>Friendly Conference</hi> in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> repeating
these words of mine, <q>That I claim my Estate in a
natural and civil capacity, without relation to a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial
Function, returns this Reply, pag. 310.</q>
               <hi>This will pass for an Argument, when he can prove that
the Ministers of the Gospel ought to be reputed Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laws,
and what is set apart for such ought to be exposed
to the Rapine of every sacriligious Ruffian. And if
humane Laws be a good Plea for other men, I do not
know why they should be a bad Plea for us, and this</hi>
(sayes he) <hi>may serve to answer several of his pages,
where he beats the Air with a repetition of a company of
vain and empty words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this a <hi>strange</hi> Answer? what part of it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>sober</hi> or at all <hi>pertinent</hi> to the matter? But
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:65611:173"/>
letting pass the former part of this Answer (which
bespeaks him a fitter man to <hi>wrangle with Ruffians,</hi>
then discourse with sober and civil people) since in
the latter part he sayes, <hi>If humane Laws be a good
Plea for other men, he does not know why they should be
a bad Plea for them,</hi> I will adventure once more to
incur his Displeasure, by telling him that one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, because his Plea being spiritual, grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a spiritual consideration, is not sutable to those
humane and temporal Laws, as ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er mens Pleas,
which are not spiritual, but temporal, are. And
when his Brother Priest insists on the Divine Right of
Tythes, and claims them by the Law of God, if one of
his Parishioners (or any Lay-man) should say as this
Priest does, If Divine Laws may be a good Plea <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or
other men, I do not know why they should be a bad
Plea for me; and thereupon produce either the Law
of <hi>Moses,</hi> or some Text in the New Testament to
prove his Title to the Estate he claims; would not
he be apt to smile at his Parishioner, and inform him,
that he claiming in a <hi>civil</hi> capacity, not upon <hi>spirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
but <hi>temporal</hi> Considerations, must have recourse
to <hi>humane</hi> Laws for the Confirmation of his Claim,
and not expect to have a <hi>civil</hi> Claim grounded on
<hi>humane</hi> and <hi>temporal</hi> Considerations, secured and
made good unto him by the <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> Law
of God? With how much more Reason might his
Parishioner even laugh out-right at him, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to be a Minister of Christ, and in that capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
or Qualification claiming Tythes as due to him,
<hi>not</hi> upon <hi>temporal</hi> but <hi>spiritual</hi> Considerations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
himself to humane Laws to make his Title
good?</p>
            <p>But leaving this as a sufficient Reply to that little
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:65611:173"/>
piece of insufficient Answer, which he is pleased t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
afford to so many pages of mine, I turn me to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Priest, who I find uses many more words, though
not much more to the purpose.</p>
            <p>§. 2. In my Answer to the first Priest, pag. 311.
I said, <q>I shall discover his Fallacy further, by telling
him, not only that I enjoy my Estate as a temporal
Right, but also that I claim it in a natural and civil
Capacity, without relation to a ministerial Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>itual Office, as a Man, not as a Minister
of Christ. But the Priest doth not claim Tythes in
this Capacity. He claims in a spiritual Capacity
(although his Claim be false) his Claim depends
upon a ministerial Function. He claims not as a
Man, but as a Minister of Christ (for such he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to be, though he be not.) His Claim there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to Tythes, and my Claim to my temporal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
differing in the very Ground and Nature of
them, that which will make good my claim to my
Estate, will not make good his Claim to Tythes.
Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> my Claim to my Estate being grounded upon a
natural or temporal consideration only, a temporal
Right is sufficient to make it good. But his Claim
to Tythes being grounded upon a spiritual conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
(as he pretends to be a Minister of Christ)
a temporal Right is no way equal or suitable to his
Claim.</q> The first part of these words the Priest
recites, and thereto thus replyes, (Right of Tythes,
pag. 143.) T. E. <hi>doth not claim meerly in his natural
Capacity, nor barely as a Man (for all his talking)
since many wiser and better men then</hi> T. E. <hi>have no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state

            </p>
            <p>What I meant by a <hi>natural</hi> Capacity is explained
by the word <hi>[civil]</hi> as also by the following words
<hi>[without relation to a ministerial Function or spiritual
Office]</hi> which plainly shews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I there opposed not a
<hi>natural</hi> capacity to a <hi>civil</hi> capacity (for <hi>I joyn them
together)</hi> but a <hi>natural</hi> capacity to a <hi>spiritual</hi> capacity;
and therefore when I mention the Priests Claim, I say
he claims in a <hi>spiritual</hi> capacity, his Claim depends
upon a <hi>ministerial Function.</hi> In like manner, when
I say I claim <hi>as a man,</hi> it is clear I there intend <hi>man</hi>
in that sense wherein <hi>Man</hi> is opposed to a <hi>Minister</hi>
of Christ; and therefore afterwards speaking of the
Priests Claim, I say, he claims <hi>not as a Man,</hi> but <hi>as
a Minister</hi> of Christ. Neither did I say as the Priest
replies, that I claim <hi>meerly</hi> in my natural capacity, or
<hi>barely</hi> as a man; nor could the Priest, in his right
Wits, understand me so to mean. But this is a meer
Catch of his, to <hi>avoid the force of my Argument,</hi> and
make his <hi>less-observant</hi> Readers think he has said <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
whenas indeed what he has said is <hi>nothing at
all to the purpose.</hi> When I say I claim in a <hi>natural</hi>
and <hi>civil</hi> capacity, I include those <hi>civil Qualifications</hi>
which may justly entitle to such a claim, whether
they arise from <hi>Purchase, Heirship, Free Gift, Civil

Tythes, <hi>not</hi> in a <hi>civil</hi> capacity, <hi>not</hi> upon <hi>civil</hi>
qualifications, but in a <hi>spiritual</hi> or <hi>religious</hi> capacity,
upon <hi>religious</hi> qualifications, as a <hi>Priest</hi> and (preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
<hi>Minister</hi> of Christ, that which will make good
my <hi>civil</hi> claim to my Estate, will not make good his
<hi>religious</hi> claim to Tythes. The difference between
<hi>civil</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> capacities and qualifications, and
the Claims arising therefrom may appear the more
clearly, if we consider them both in one and the same
Person. Suppose at this time (as was formerly fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent)
a Clergy-man or Priest were <hi>Chancellor</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> or invested with any other civil Office; he
by vertue of that <hi>civil</hi> qualification, would have a
good claim to such <hi>temporal</hi> Estate as should be annext
to that <hi>civil</hi> Office with which he is so invested; but
he could not claim <hi>that Estate</hi> by vertue of his <hi>Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
or as a man <hi>religiously</hi> qualified, any more then he
could claim <hi>Tythes</hi> by vertue of his <hi>Chancellorship,</hi> or as
a man <hi>civilly</hi> qualified. Hence the necessary and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
distinction between <hi>civil</hi> &amp; <hi>religious</hi> Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
and Claims is manifest. Now as he that makes
claim to an <hi>Estate</hi> by vertue of a <hi>civil</hi> Qualification
ought to prove, maintain, defend his Claim by <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
Laws, as being <hi>suitable</hi> to the <hi>nature</hi> of his
<hi>Claim:</hi> so he that makes claim to <hi>Tythes</hi> by vertue
of a <hi>religious</hi> qualification, ought to prove, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
defend his claim by <hi>divine</hi> Laws, as being <hi>suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
to the <hi>nature</hi> of his <hi>Clai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>But the Priest, having wrested my words from</hi>
a natural and civil capacity, <hi>to a MEER</hi> natural ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
<hi>void of all</hi> civil <hi>Qualifications, goes on to
make what Advantage he can by this unworthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertion.</hi>
Well, <hi>sayes he,</hi> the Priest hath a natural ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
also, as well as <hi>T. E.</hi> is as much and as good a
man as he; but this alone gives him no Title to his
Tythes; he claims them in a spiritual capacity, as <hi>T. E.</hi>
claims his Estate in a civil capacity: and now, why
is not a spiritual capacity as good a ground of claim to
an Estate legally settled upon it, as a civil capacity?
<hi>pag.</hi> 144.</p>
            <p>If he means by <hi>[legally settled]</hi> settled by <hi>divine</hi> &amp;
<hi>spiritual</hi> Laws, as Tythes were on the <hi>Iewish</hi> Priests,
a spiritual capacity is <hi>as Good</hi> a ground of claim to an
Estate settled as a civil capacity is of claim to an
Estate so settled, by humane Laws; but a <hi>spiritual</hi> capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
is <hi>not so good</hi> a ground of claim to an Estate set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
by <hi>humane</hi> Laws, as a <hi>civil</hi> capacity, because a
Claim grounded on a <hi>civil</hi> capacity is of <hi>the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

is it to the purpose! how <hi>irrelative</hi> to the
Case in hand! Neither is what follows of any more
force, or any whit more to the purpose. <hi>Why</hi> (sayes
he, <hi>ibid.) is not a Religious Office as endowable as a

makes him not uncapable of a temporal right; for St.</hi>
Paul <hi>saith, the King is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Minister of
God,</hi> Rom. 13. 4.</p>
            <p>One's being a Minister of Christ doth not make
him <hi>uncapable</hi> of a <hi>temporal</hi> Right, nor any whit <hi>more
capable</hi> of a <hi>temporal</hi> Right. If he that is a Minister
of Christ has right to a <hi>temporal</hi> Estate (patrimonial
or other) which he claims and holds in a <hi>civil</hi> capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
his being a Minister of Christ doth <hi>not divest him</hi>
of his Right to that <hi>temporal</hi> Estate, as it would <hi>not
invest him</hi> with such a Right, if he were not in such a
<hi>civil</hi> capacity, and under such a qualification, as
doth entitle him to it. Thus we see many of the
Clergy have <hi>temporal</hi> Estates, which they claim and
hold in a <hi>civil</hi> capacity, as men under such <hi>civil</hi> qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:65611:176"/>
               <hi>without any regard to their Priestly Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and in their enjoyment of those Estates, no man
I suppose impugns them. But to what end doth
the Priest urge the words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that the King
is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>the Minister of God?</hi> Methinks he
should not mean, that the King is the Minister of
God <hi>in the same sense</hi> wherein he himself pretends to
be a Minister of Christ. But if he would needs make
the King <hi>a Clergy man,</hi> he might, one would think,
have holpen him to an <hi>higher Office</hi> among them then
a <hi>Deaconship.</hi> The King is indeed the Minister of
God, but his ministerial function is <hi>civil;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is called the <hi>civil Magistrate.</hi> And if we
consider the time wherein that Epistle to the <hi>Romans</hi>
was written, we shall find no cause to suppose the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
call'd the Magistrate the Minister of God in
a <hi>Religious</hi> and <hi>Spiritual</hi> sense: it being written pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
about the beginning of <hi>Nero's</hi> Reign, then
whom that Age did not bring forth a <hi>greater Enemy</hi>
to the <hi>Christian</hi>-Religion. And being spoken of
Magistracy in general, it cannot without the <hi>greatest

the Magisterial Office be a <hi>civil</hi> Office and Function,
to what end serves the mention of it here? <hi>The

               </hi> and <hi>stable</hi> as the <hi>Priest's claim to Tythes</hi>
is <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>feeble.</hi> And the Priest knows too, that
the King claims his Rights upon considerations of
<hi>another nature,</hi> then those upon which the Priest
claims Tythes: for the King claims his Rights in a
<hi>civil</hi> capacity, and under a <hi>civil</hi> qualification, by
vertue of the administration of a <hi>civil</hi> Office; but
the Priest claims Tythes in a <hi>Religious</hi> capacity, and
upon the account of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Office. Judge now
Reader how <hi>very impertinently</hi> the Priest has urged
this Instance, and how far it is from helping him: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the same rate goes he on for several pages toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
offering nothing of solid Argument, but <hi>mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Sophistry.</hi> He undertakes (pag. 146.) to evidence
the Priests claim by a parallel. <hi>Suppose,</hi> sayes he,
<hi>some Prince or great Man did out of his own Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
make a donation of some certain Lands or Rents
to an</hi> Elwood, <hi>and entail it on the Family of</hi> Elwoods
<hi>forever; if</hi> T. E. <hi>be the Heir of that Family, he will
say he hath as good a Right to this as if he had purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
it. And why may not,</hi> sayes he, <hi>the Priest claim
his Tythes as justly as</hi> T. E. <hi>claims this Donative?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are many Reasons why he should not (both
with relation to the <hi>Giver,</hi> to the <hi>Gift</hi> it self, and to
the <hi>considerations</hi> on which it is given) but that which
is most direct to the present case, is the <hi>different ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities
of the Claimers. T. E.</hi> if he should claim such
a Donative, must claim it in <hi>a civil</hi> capacity, under a
<hi>civil</hi> qualification, without respect to any <hi>Religious</hi>
Office; but the Priest claims <hi>not</hi> Tythes <hi>so,</hi> but quite
contrary: he claims on the score of a <hi>Religious</hi> Office
without respect to any <hi>civil</hi> capacity or qualification
at all. What can be more <hi>different</hi> then two such
Claims, whereof one is <hi>meerly Civil,</hi> the other
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:65611:177"/>
               <hi>meerly Religious?</hi> Now that Claim that is <hi>civil</hi> falls

are of the <hi>same nature</hi> with it; but so doth not the

the page out of which he has taken this, I observed</hi>
how willing the Priest was, for his own interest, to paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
his cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with the Parishioners, as if there were no

th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, and the other claims a temporal thing. One
claims by a temporal Right, and the other claims by a
temporal Right. One hath no need of a Precept or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
in holy Scripture for what he claims, no more
hath the other. Thus he takes his Parishioner by the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ose, and endeavours to cokes him into a conceit, that
their cases answer pat to one another, that their Right
is all one, their Claim one and the same, their pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
just alike. But then <hi>(say I)</hi> they must not stay
there, the Priest must also acknowledge, he is no more
a Minister of Christ then the other, at least that he
doth not claim Tythes as a Minister of Christ, any
more then the other doth his temporal Estate; otherwise
the parallel will not hold. For if he claims Tythes as a
Minister of Christ, if he demands them in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a spiritual Office, I am sure then their Claims
will not agree; and that which will be sufficient to make
good a Title to the one, will not be so to the other. <hi>This

               </gap>nds <hi>I made this</hi> Conclusion. <hi>The Priest
sayes,</hi> The maxim on which this inference is grounded,
is this wretched absurdity? That none can have equal
temporal rights by the Laws, unless they be equal in all
Capacities.</p>
            <p>But this (to use his own term) is a <hi>wretched</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth;
for my Inference is not grounded on such a

but that if one claimed in a <hi>civil</hi> capacity &amp;
the other in a <hi>spiritual,</hi> their Claims then would <hi>not

               </gap> that claims in a <hi>spiritual</hi> capacity is therein <hi>opposite</hi>
not only to him that claims in a <hi>civil</hi> capacity, but <hi>to

rightly be made use of to maintain a <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
claim. But he sayes, <hi>The same Laws do give
equal temporal Rights to persons of all kind of Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
for the same Estate,</hi> he sayes, <hi>may be enjoyed by
Iudge first, then by a Souldier, then by a Mercha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

may have an equal Right to this Estate, though they be
every one of different Capacities,</hi> pag. 149.</p>
            <p>Though he sayes the same Laws give <hi>equal temporal</hi>
Rights to Persons of <hi>all kind</hi> of Capacities, yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Instances he gives to demonstrate his Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there is <hi>never an one of his Capacity;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it reaches not his case. His Instances of a <hi>Iudge,</hi>
a <hi>Souldier,</hi> a <hi>Merchant,</hi> a <hi>Woman,</hi> are <hi>all civil,</hi> of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:65611:178"/>
the <hi>same Nature</hi> with the Laws by which they
claim: but so is not the Priest, he claiming in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of <hi>a contrary Nature</hi> to the Laws by which he
claims: for the Laws are <hi>human</hi> and <hi>civil,</hi> but the
capacity he claims in is <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Religious.</hi> He
has one instance more, but that no more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
then the former. <hi>Suppose</hi> (sayes he, pag. 149.)
<hi>the King have by the Law a temporal Right to one E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and some of his Subjects an equal Right to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

of arguing: The King claims a temporal thing; so
doth the Subject: the King claims by a temporal right;
so doth the Subject: the King hath no need of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to prove his right; no more hath the Subject: yet
for all this, their Claim is not one and the same, they
must stay there; the King must acknowledge himself no
more a King then the Subject, or else the cases are not
parallel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this, as in the next, his <hi>Sophistry</hi> is evident.
This is not (as he <hi>floutingly</hi> calls it) my <hi>wise way</hi> of
arguing, but his <hi>foul way</hi> of perverting Arguments.
I argued not between a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Subject,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a <hi>Priest</hi> and a <hi>Parishioner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> showing the <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi>
of the Capacities in which they claimed. This
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e turns off from the <hi>Priest</hi> to the <hi>King,</hi> as if the
<hi>King's</hi> case and the <hi>Priest's</hi> were so <hi>just alike,</hi> that
whatsoever is said of the <hi>Priest's</hi> case must needs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
to the <hi>King's;</hi> whereas the <hi>Priest's</hi> case is as
contrary to the <hi>King's,</hi> as it is to the <hi>Parishioners:</hi>
for the <hi>King</hi> claims in a <hi>civil</hi> capacity as well as the
<hi>Parishioner,</hi> but the <hi>Priest</hi> claims in a <hi>Religious</hi> capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
<hi>contrary to both.</hi> A <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Subject</hi> may well
have <hi>equal</hi> right to their respective Estates by the
<hi>same</hi> Laws, because though the <hi>qualifications</hi> under
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:65611:179"/>
which they claim, <hi>differ in degrees,</hi> yet they <hi>differ
not in Nature;</hi> they are <hi>both civil,</hi> and <hi>both</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the
<hi>same</hi> Nature with those <hi>Laws</hi> by which they claim.
But with the <hi>Priest</hi> it is <hi>quite otherwise:</hi> The quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
under which he claims Tythes, is <hi>quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>
to that under which the <hi>Parishioner</hi> claims his
Estate, and no less to the <hi>Laws</hi> also by which himself
claims Tythes.</p>
            <p>The rest of this Section he spends in Railing, and

               </gap>at the
<hi>Institution of Tythes,</hi> since the times of the Gospel,
<hi>was Popish,</hi> that <hi>Popery</hi> had made her encroachments
in the Church <hi>before Tythes</hi> were settled on it; that
those settlements of Tythes that were afterwards
made, proceeded from a <hi>blind zeal</hi> and <hi>superstitious
Devotion,</hi> grounded on Principles <hi>repugnant to the
true</hi> Christian-<hi>Religion,</hi> which I recommend to the
consideration and Conscience of every serious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In his 27. Section he quarrels at three passages of
mine; One is the description of a Ministers mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
from</hi> Luke 10. 7, 8. <hi>and</hi> Matth. 10. 11. <hi>Against
which he objects, pag. 156. That</hi> if this order of
taking Meat and Drink then, were a perpetual and
general rule to all Ministers to the World's end, so
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:65611:179"/>
must also all the rest of the rules their mentioned
be.</p>
            <p>That does not follow. If <hi>some</hi> of those Rules had
relation to that particular service <hi>only,</hi> yet <hi>this</hi> of
maintenance was <hi>more general;</hi> and therefore he
may observe, that when our Saviour afterwards gave
his <hi>more general</hi> Commission for the preaching of the
Gospel to all Nations, he made <hi>no new</hi> Provision for
their maintenance; which argues he intended the
continuance of that which <hi>he had before</hi> appointed;
and this also is confirmed by the <hi>practice</hi> of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
afterward, especially of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who
though he was not imployed in that <hi>particular</hi> Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
on which the other Apostles were sent (for he
was not converted till some Years after) yet refers
directly to the maintenance <hi>there</hi> appointed <hi>[Have
we not power to Eat and to Drink? 1 Cor.</hi> 9. 4.] So that
we see the Apostle understood that maintenance
which Christ had at first appointed was <hi>to continue,</hi>
(and accordingly asserts his power to receive it, long
after that particular occasion, on which it was first
given, was over) and yet he did not observe those
<hi>other</hi> directions which were given on that particular
occasion: for he both <hi>preach't to the Gentiles,</hi> and
had <hi>Money in his Purse,</hi> and that of his own earning
too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next passage is this, He says, pag.</hi> 157. I sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily
ask Kings and Princes where Christ gave them
power to alter that Maintenance, and set up another in
the room of it? arrogantly telling them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Corah's</hi>
phrase, they take too much upon them, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> sau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e <hi>is of his own</hi> making; <hi>the question only
mine, and that made</hi> not to Kings and Princes, <hi>but</hi>
to the Priests: <hi>for when I had asked,</hi> Where hath
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:65611:180"/>
Christ given power to any man to alter this Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and set up another in the room of it? <hi>I add,</hi>
Doubtless if any such authority were given, it concerns
them that claim thereby to shew it, <hi>and they to be sure
are the Priests. The other part also of the sentence
he carps at, wherein he sayes,</hi> I arrogantly tell them
in <hi>Corah's</hi> phrase they take too much upon them, unless
they can shew where Christ gave them such authority) <hi>is of</hi>
his own Cooking: <hi>for I told them not in</hi> Corah's phrase
<hi>They take too much upon them; but</hi> modestly <hi>askt,</hi>
If Christ hath given no such power, whence then doth
man take so much upon him? <hi>And this Inquiry too
related to</hi> the settlement of Tythes in the time of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.
But, <hi>sayes he, pag.</hi> 158. let me ask this bold
Questionist, Where Christ forbid them to give a better
Maintenance? He bid the Apostles be content with
Meat and Drink; but he did not forbid them to take
more, if it were freely given.</p>
            <p>Can a <hi>better</hi> Maintenance be given, then that
which Christ himself appointed? He who was Lord
of all, if he had thought Tythes, or a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y other main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<hi>better</hi> then this, could as well have appointed
that. This Priest, I perceive, measures the <hi>goodness</hi>
of the maintenance by the <hi>greatness,</hi> and accounts that
<hi>best</hi> that is <hi>bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gest.</hi> But doubtless the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
went by <hi>another Rule;</hi> for he accounted that <hi>best</hi>
which was <hi>least chargeable</hi> to the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.
18. To shew there needed no express command for
making the maintenance better, he tells me (pag.
159.) <hi>That an Hint is a Command to a Soul that loves
God.</hi> Be it so: yet not so much as an <hi>Hint</hi> shall he
find throughout all the New Testament for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Tythes.</hi> But seeing he sayes Christ <hi>bid</hi> the
Apostles be content with Meat and Drink (which
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:65611:180"/>
was somewhat more then a <hi>bare hint)</hi> methink, if he
(who pretends to be one of the Apostles Successors)
were a Soul t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at truly loved God, he should <hi>content
himself</hi> with what he sayes Christ <hi>bid</hi> his Apostles be
<hi>content</hi> with; and not thus scrable after more. See now
the man's partiality, An Hint must pass for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to the People for giving: but an express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
will not suffice to make the Priest content with
what the People give. Is this a sign of a Soul that
truly loves God? 'Tis true, the Apostles were not
forbidden to receive more, nor Believers to give
more: neither lies the Objection in my Book against
<hi>giving more,</hi> but against <hi>altering the nature</hi> of the
Maintenance, and setting up <hi>another</hi> Maintenance of
a <hi>different</hi> nature from that which Christ appointed:
For that Maintenance was <hi>free</hi> and <hi>voluntary,</hi> and so
ought the Maintenance of <hi>Christian</hi> Ministers to be
<hi>alwayes;</hi> but a Maintenance <hi>settled</hi> by humane Laws
<hi>ceases</hi> to be <hi>free,</hi> and so is not suitable to the Gospel,
which it self is free.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But to render me ridiculous, the Priest says,</hi> ibid.
No doubt he will ask the primitive Believers, who gave
them order to sell their Estates, and give them to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles?
He will say, They took too much upon them.
<hi>And hereupon he sayes,</hi> Was ever so much Folly and
Impudence conjoyned?</p>
            <p>No doubt he had had <hi>one sin</hi> les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to answer for, had
he left out this <hi>Abuse.</hi> The Primitive Believers nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no Order for selling their Estates, any more then
Believers do now, nor in disposing the Money as
they did. But if the primitive Believers should
have taken upon them to have <hi>injoyned</hi> all other Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
afterwards to sell their Estates too, and give
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:65611:181"/>
the Money to their Ministers, they would therein
have taken too much upon them. Believers in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
might be <hi>as liberal</hi> as they pleased to their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;
but they might not make that which was <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality</hi>
in themselves, an <hi>Imposition</hi> and <hi>Burden</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them that came after, who may justly and reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
expect to enjoy the <hi>same Liberty</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> to
express <hi>their Liberality,</hi> as the others did who went
before. For as the Gospel it self, in its own nature,
is <hi>equally free</hi> in all Ages, and the Ministers of the
Gospel are so too, in respect of its publication (so
as not to preach the Gospel because humane Laws
command, nor to forbear to preach it because humane

                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> third <hi>Passage that he cavils at in this Section,
he thus gives, pag.</hi> 160. For any Magistrate to set out
Tythes for a Maintenance, is a direct Opposition to
Christ, because they were commanded in the <hi>Levitical</hi>
Law, and Christ hath taken away Priest, Law and
Tythes altogether. How proves he this, <hi>saith he?</hi> by
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. The Verse, <hi>saith he,</hi> he cunningly leaves out,
being conscious to himself he had fathered a Lye on that
Chapter, in which there is not one word of Christ's ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away Tythes, no nor in any place of the New T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What himself is guilty of, that he charges upon

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>unningly leaving out</hi> of things: for he
has <hi>cunningly left out</hi> a material Clause in that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of mine which he quoted, namely, that <hi>Christ
hath disannulled that Law by which Tythes had been
commanded to be paid unto the</hi> Leviti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al <hi>Priesthood;</hi>
which makes the <hi>taking away of Tythes</hi> a necessary
consequent, when the <hi>Law was taken away</hi> by which
they stood. 'Tis true, I added not th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Verse in
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. because the greatest part of the whole Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
tends to the proof of my Assertion, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I was willing the Reader should read through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
But seeing my unfair Adversary hath made so
Ill an use of my Good Meaning, I will add the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
to let the Reader see how much I am abused;
<hi>Heb.</hi> 7. vers. 5. compared with vers. 12. and vers.
18. In the 5th verse the Apostle shews, that <hi>the
Sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>who received the Office of the Priesthood,
had a Commandment to take Tythes of the People accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Law.</hi> In the 12th verse he sayes, <hi>The
Priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65611:182"/>
change also of the Law;</hi> so that here the <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
by which they took Tythes, <hi>was taken away,</hi>
and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e remained no Commandment to take Tythes
by. Then in the 18th verse he sayes expresly, <hi>There
is verily a disannulling of the Commandment going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for the Weakness and Vnprofitableness thereof:</hi>
Now the <hi>disannulling the Commandment</hi> by which
Tythes were due, is a <hi>disannulling of Tythes.</hi> How
did Christ take away the <hi>Levitical Priesthood,</hi> but
by taking away the <hi>Law</hi> by which that <hi>Priesthood</hi>
was made, and setting up <hi>another Priesthood</hi> in its
room? In like manner he took away the <hi>Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
by Tythes,</hi> by <hi>taking away the Law</hi> by which
<hi>that Maintenance</hi> was commanded, and setting up
<hi>another Maintenance</hi> in its room. And as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
exercised the <hi>New Priesthood</hi> without regard to
the <hi>Old:</hi> so they also received the <hi>New Maintenance,</hi>
and looked not after the <hi>Old;</hi> plainly intimating they
understood the <hi>Old Maintenance</hi> to be <hi>ended,</hi> as well
as the <hi>Old Priesthood.</hi> And <hi>Andrew Willet</hi> fairly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
it in his <hi>Synopsis</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> fifth General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie,
pag. 314. <q>S. <hi>Paul</hi> (saith he) saith in flat
words, <hi>If the Priesthood be changed, of necessity there
must also be a change of the Law,</hi> Heb. 7. 12. But the
<hi>Priesthood</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> is alt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

also the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and so consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Ceremonial Duty of Tythes.</hi>
               </q> Thus he, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
at once he both acknowledges Tythes to be Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial,
and proves them ended with the Legal
Priesthood.</p>
            <p>§. 4. <hi>In his next Section, pag. 161. the Priest
charges me with</hi> evading all serious Answers by some
petty Cavil, <hi>for proof of which he gives this Instance;

That the Author of the</hi> Friendly Conference <hi>having

               </gap>
               <hi>petty Cavil to evade a serious Answer,</hi> I will briefly set
down the manner of it; The Author of the <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Conference,</hi> pag. 154. having affirmed (not pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ved)
<hi>that Tythes and other Church-Revenues have been
settled by those that were actually seized of them in Law,</hi>
adds thus; <hi>Now if the</hi> Quakers <hi>can prove from the
Laws of God or Right Reason, that it is not lawful
for every one to do what he will with his own, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently,
that he may not settle Tythes, Lands or M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys
upon the Clergy, then they do something to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi>
Hereupon in my Answer, pag. 320. I say,
<q>That I may be sure to do something, even in his
sense, to the purpose, I will prove both from the
Laws of God and Right Reason, that it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for every man to do what he will with his own.</q>
Accordingly I there prove (pag. 321.) first in <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
That a man may not imploy his Estate to an Evil
Vse:</hi> then more <hi>particularly,</hi> That <hi>he may not spend
his Substance upon his Lusts;</hi> That <hi>he may not bestow it
among Harlots;</hi> That <hi>he may not make an Idol of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
nor uphold Idolatry with it.</hi> Now in the General Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
and this last Particular, I had direct relation
to the Settlement of Tythes, having proved before,
that Tythes were imployed to an Evil Use in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a Corrupt Clergy, and that it was an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous
Worship which Tythes were given to uphold.
And to manifest, that I did not leave my Argument
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:65611:183"/>
to catch at or play upon a Word or Phrase (as the
Author of the <hi>F. Confer.</hi> falsly charges me in his <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi>
pag. 310.) but prosecuted my Argument
fairly, to prove that the <hi>settlement of Tythes on the
Clergy was evil,</hi> in order thereunto I thus reasoned,
(pag. 321, 322.) <q>Will any <hi>Protestant</hi> be so inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
as to say, that it is lawful for a man to lay out
his Money in Beads, Crosses, Crucifixes, <hi>Agnu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Dei</hi>'s, and such like trumpery? Will he say it is
lawful to buy Masses, Prayers, Pardon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
&amp;c? Will he say it was lawful, by the
Law of God, for <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> to give two
hundred Marks a year to buy Oyl, to keep S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s
Lamps and S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Lamps burning? If he
thinks this justifiable, let him defend it; if not,
he may in this very instance see, both that it is
not lawful for every man to do what he will with his
own; and also, that <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> his great Donor
and Patron, did that with his own that was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for him to have done, namely, uphold Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Idolatry.</q> Thus having proved both that
a man may not do what he will with his own, as also
that <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> in his other Church-Donations did
<hi>that</hi> with his own which it was <hi>not lawful</hi> for <hi>him</hi> to
have done (and in which the Priests, neither one nor
t'other, <hi>sayes any thing in his Defence</hi> (though fairly
invited to it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but leave him under the Judgment of
having done Evil therein.) I go on there to shew,
that <q>He did not transgress in this Instance only, of
giving that yearly Pension to <hi>Rome,</hi> but in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Tythes also: for it is evident he gave them
to maintain a <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy, degenerated from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical
Purity, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:65611:183"/>
and Practice, in upholding of which he di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
that which was Evil, and therefore to be sure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</q>
Judge now, Reader, whether this be
<hi>leaving</hi> my Argument to <hi>catch at</hi> or <hi>play upon</hi>

I have proved that <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> in the settlement of
Tythes, did that with his own which was <hi>evil.</hi> in <hi>uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a false Religion,</hi> which it more concerns the Priest
to clear him from, then thus without cause to cavil.</p>
            <p>§. 5. In my Answer to the <hi>Friendly Conference,</hi> I
said, pag. 323. <q>Suppose that <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> had an ample
Power of disposing what he pleased, or that the
People had by consent joyned with him in the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

every man according to the Interest he had;
yet neither could he single, nor he and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
grant any more then belonged to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</q>
This was too plain to be denyed, being
grounded on a firm Maxim, <hi>Nemo plus juris ad alium

can transfer more Right to another then he himself hath;</hi>
therefore they seek wayes to evade it. The Author

               <hi>grant but a part of that Estate forever?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this I perceive he has taught his Parishioner
to use as <hi>little Honesty</hi> as himself. The Parishioner
has learnt of the Priest to <hi>chop</hi> and <hi>mangle</hi> Sentences,
and cunningly leave out what he likes not. He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
me here say. <hi>To make a Grant of the tenth</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <hi>forever is (in my understanding) utterly repugnant to
Reason.</hi> This goes clearer with the Priest, as if I had
said it was repugnant to Reason to grant the tenth
<hi>part of an Estate forever,</hi> and accordingly he argue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

whereas I say plainly, <hi>They might have disposed of
what part of the Land they pleased, they might have
given the tenth part of the Land, the tenth Acre,</hi> &amp;c.
But <hi>that which I said is</hi> (to my understanding) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to Reason, Iustice and Equity, is for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to
make a grant of the tenth part of the</hi> PROFITS <hi>of the
Land forever.</hi> (These words <hi>[of the profits of the
Land]</hi> he leaves out in reciting my words, thereby
drawing it from the <hi>profits</hi> of the Land to the <hi>Land
it self)</hi> which alters the case: for as I shewed, <hi>the
profits of the Land forever</hi> could not be said to belong
to them, because it depended on the stock, labour,
&amp;c. of another, which they had no interest in no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
right unto. But <hi>if the profits of the Land forever
did not belong to them, and they had no power to grant
any more then did belong to themselves, it follows that
they had no power to grant the Tythes of the profits of
the Land forever.</hi> [They endeavour to weaken the
force of this Argument by comparing Tythes with a
Rent-charge, urging, That <hi>the owners might as well
make a grant of Tythes forever, as set a Rent-charge
upon their Lands forever.]</hi> This the Author of the

But he that shall impartially consider the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

the <hi>Land,</hi> but by reason of the <hi>stock</hi> and <hi>labour,</hi> &amp;c.
imploy'd thereon by him that occupies it, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by this, that they who have <hi>no Lands,</hi> are as
well charged with the <hi>payment of Tythes</hi> out of the
improvement or <hi>increase</hi> of their <hi>stocks</hi> and <hi>labours</hi> in
their <hi>Trades</hi> and manual <hi>Occupations,</hi> as they are who
occupy <hi>Lands.</hi> So that <hi>Tythes</hi> lie properly on the <hi>stock</hi>
not on the <hi>Land;</hi> but a <hi>Rent-charge</hi> lies properly on
the <hi>Land,</hi> not on the <hi>stock;</hi> and therefore although

yet <hi>the Rent-charge must be paid,</hi> because it is charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in consideration of the <hi>Land it self:</hi> but it is not
so in the case of Tythes. If there be <hi>no increase, no
profit made, no Crop planted, nor any thing renewing
upon the Land, no Tythe can be demanded,</hi> because
<hi>Tythe is charged in consideration of the increase and
improvement made of the Stock.</hi> And for the <hi>Non-payment</hi>
of a <hi>Rent-charge,</hi> he on whom it is settled,
may <hi>enter</hi> upon and <hi>possess</hi> the <hi>Land</hi> which is charged

is otherwise. For <hi>non-payment</hi> of <hi>Tythes,</hi> he who
claims them, <hi>cannot enter</hi> upon or <hi>possess</hi> the <hi>land,</hi> but

the <hi>free-spirited</hi> Reader judge. Against this the
Priest objects thus, <hi>Doth not the raising the sum of

as well as the preparing of Tythe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>The case of a <hi>Rent-charge</hi> even in this Respect is
<hi>greatly different</hi> from that of <hi>Tythes.</hi> For a <hi>Rent-charge</hi>
is a burden, <hi>fixt</hi> upon the Land, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the maxim, <hi>The Burden descending with the
Inheritance, he that</hi> (as the Priest sayes, pag. 170.)
<hi>will not have the incumbrance, must not have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</hi>
He therefore to whom such Land descends
on which the burden of a <hi>Rent-charge</hi> lies, finding
he cannot enjoy the Land without performing the
condition (which is to pay the <hi>Rent-charge) subjects
himself</hi> unto the burden, and that he may enjoy the
Estate <hi>undertakes</hi> the performance of the Condition,
which thus becomes <hi>his own act.</hi> So that this man's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
do not take upon them <hi>to give away his stock,
labour, skill</hi> and <hi>industry</hi> (for they only charge a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
on their <hi>own land,</hi> which he is at liberty to <hi>take</hi> or
<hi>leave.)</hi> But <hi>he himself gives away his own stock <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>abour,
skill</hi> and <hi>industry,</hi> that he may enjoy the Estate. But it
is <hi>far otherwise</hi> in the case of Tythes: for <hi>Tythe</hi>
(though a Burden and a grievous one too) is <hi>not fixt
upon the Land, nor descends with the Inheritance:</hi> for
they who have <hi>no lands nor inheritances,</hi> are liable,
if they have <hi>personal Estates,</hi> to pay Tythes as well
as they that have Lands; and they that have Lands
are <hi>not liable</hi> to pay Tythes, unless by imploying a
Stock or <hi>personal</hi> Estate upon them, they make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
or have something renew upon the Land.
Nay, it hath been held possible so to order the matter,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:65611:186"/>
as to reap the benefit of the Lands, and yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

from the incumbrance of Tythes. However, if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
to whom the Land descends, refuse to pay the Tythes,
yet he is in no danger of <hi>loosing the land.</hi> So that he
hath not the Land <hi>under condition of paying Tythes,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
the other has <hi>under condition of paying a Rent-charge,</hi>
&amp; therefore neither needs nor doth <hi>subject himself</hi> to

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
in short lies the <hi>civil difference</hi> between a <hi>Rent-charge</hi>
and <hi>Tythes.</hi> A <hi>Rent-charge</hi> is a <hi>burden</hi> charged upon
the <hi>land, Tythe</hi> is a <hi>burde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> lies upon the <hi>stock.</hi> A
<hi>Rent-charge</hi> is laid upon the <hi>lands</hi> by them that had a
<hi>just Propriety</hi> therein; Tythe is laid upon the <hi>stock</hi> by
them that had <hi>no Propriety at all</hi> therein; the <hi>stock</hi>
and <hi>labour,</hi> &amp;c. of the <hi>present Possessor</hi> is <hi>not subjected</hi>
to the <hi>Rent-charge</hi> unless by <hi>his own</hi> consent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking;
but the <hi>stock</hi> and <hi>labour,</hi> &amp;c. of the
<hi>present Possessor is subjected</hi> to the burden of <hi>Tythes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
without his own</hi> consent or undertaking, yea <hi>against
it.</hi> By this it appears, both that a <hi>Rent-charge</hi> and
<hi>Tythes</hi> are <hi>very unlike,</hi> and that it is <hi>utterly repugnant
to reason,</hi> to suppose that <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> and his People
had power to <hi>load their Posterity</hi> with the <hi>burden of
Tythes forever.</hi> And indeed if we consider <hi>the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi>
of our Ancestors, in their Donations of Tythes
we may find, that they did not look upon <hi>Tythes</hi> to
be at all of the Nature of a <hi>Rent-charge;</hi> for they
took great care by <hi>legal settlements</hi> to secure and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
those <hi>Rent-charges;</hi> but made <hi>no provision</hi> (for

               <hi>He objects again in pag. 170. That</hi> seeing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>As they might have sold off what part of the
Land they pleased, so they might have laid a charge
upon the Land, because the property of the Land

               </gap>, because they had <hi>not a property</hi> in the stock

he sayes, <hi>If the Heir will not pay the charge, he must
renounce the land also;</hi> yet in the case of Tythes, he
knows full well <hi>it is not so:</hi> for if the Heir will <hi>not
pay Tythes,</hi> he is <hi>not bound to renounce the Land,</hi> nor
does he <hi>forfeit it</hi> by the non-payment of Tythes. But
he possesses and injoyes the Land, whether he pay
Tythes or no. Which shews, <hi>he did not receive the
Land under any condition of paying Tythes;</hi> for then
he could not injoy the Land without performing the
condition.</p>

the Priests the tenth part of those profits which did arise

and <hi>whatsoever else</hi> was necessary or

he enjoyed them to pay the Tythes. They received

For <hi>after</hi> his saying this blasphemous Argument flies

He sayes, <hi>In evil, foolish, and unjust things God hath

            <p>I reply, that the Priest <hi>falsly</hi> charges me with sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing

no pardon could be had from God, then there was no

<hi>Salvation</hi> doubtless <hi>was obtained in those times,</hi> as
well in this as other Nations in <hi>Christendom;</hi> (though
<hi>not by the help of a false Ministry)</hi> but what then?
must those <hi>indirect</hi> and <hi>wrong</hi> means, contrived to
obtain Salvation by in those times, be therefore <hi>still
kept up?</hi> and ought the <hi>charge</hi> to be still continued,
when the <hi>consideration</hi> for which it was given, is <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

the consideration for which Tythes were given; and
therefore he <hi>shuns it</hi> as much as he may, and when
he cannot avoid <hi>it,</hi> he <hi>smooths it over</hi> as fairly as he can.

and therefore his saying King <hi>Ethelwolf</hi>'s Clergy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
with the <hi>Protestant</hi>-Church of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>more</hi>
points, than with the modern corrupt Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>But what he</hi> cannot prove <hi>he is very forward to</hi>
take for granted, <hi>and therefore says, pag.</hi> 178. Since
the Donors gave them not to a <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy, but to
God and his true Ministers; our Kings and Parliaments,
that took them away from the corrupt Clergy (who were
fallen into <hi>Popery)</hi> and settled them on the true <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant

            <p>He talks idly. God never intended Tythes to any

it if he can. And for observing the Intention of the
Donors; it is manifest <hi>the Donors intended their Tythes
to such a Clergy, as would</hi> SAY MASS <hi>for their Souls

too?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, he sayes, pag.</hi> 178. Since the first Donors
did not settle them on the <hi>Popish</hi> Clergy, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

I know not wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Nor I neither; not that the first Donors did not set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
them on them (as <hi>he begs)</hi> but because <hi>that set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
was not just,</hi> and with what either <hi>Iustice</hi> or

            <p>To supply his defect of Argument he betakes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

a man that payes Tythes, unless he gives them a
<hi>sum of Money on purpose?</hi> or will they <hi>bury</hi> any of
the most zealous Tythe-payers, and not be <hi>paid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly</hi>
for it? What <hi>meer deceit</hi> is it then to name
these things as Services, for which they deserve
Tythes, when, let their Tythes be never so great,
they will not do any of all these without being <hi>paid
for it over and above.</hi> Then for the other Particulars
named, as <hi>Visiting the Poor,</hi> &amp;c. It is too notorious
that many of them spend more Time and Money in
<hi>Taverns</hi> and <hi>Ale-houses</hi> then in Visiting the Sick and
Relieving the Poor. Instead of Comforting the
Sad, they make many <hi>sad</hi> by their Exactions and
Extortions upon the people, under the specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
and gilded names of <hi>sacred Revenues</hi> and <hi>Rights
of Holy Church.</hi> If they <hi>Reprove</hi> some <hi>Sinners</hi>
by Words, they <hi>Encourage more</hi> by Example; and
what he calls <hi>Confuting of Heresies,</hi> proves often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Opposing of Truths. Lastly,</hi> He says, <hi>They

one of the Works for which they receive Tythes?
Is it the <hi>general</hi> Service and <hi>universal</hi> Labour of the
Clergy? I confess I have heard they had <hi>private Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals,</hi>
and several <hi>little Committees</hi> about my Book
(wherein he that gave the Occasion of writing it,
received no Thanks for his Labour, and wisht he had
never medled) and that after many <hi>consultations</hi> and
Debates about it, they at length resolved to divid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it into several parts, some being <hi>appointed</hi> to answer
one part, &amp; some another; which the event doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
confirm. But I never understood before that they
had a <hi>general Convocation</hi> about it, and that it was
undertaken as a <hi>National Service,</hi> for which all the
Parish Priests in the Nation must have Tythes. But
truly, had I thought there had been so many Heads
engaged in the Work, I should have expected
st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onger Reasons, and more forcible Arguments then
I find in the Replies. But we must take them as they
are now.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He sayes, pag. 181. They</hi> are alwayes ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form

            </p>
            <p>Here the other Priest puts in a word, <hi>Vindicat.</hi>
pag. 314. where his Parishioner citing those words
of mine, <q>If Tythes were a suitable Maintenance,
the Clergy now does nothing for the people which

<hi>That is, if his Worship may be judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this a learned Answer? and a notable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration
that the Clergy doth something for the
people, which deserves Tythes for a Compensation?
The Reader perhaps may think this is not the Answ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r
it self, but a Preparative only to an Answer; take
therefore his following words, thus, <hi>But what I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
do the Impropriators for the people, which deserves
so great a Compensation?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Truly nothing that I know of; nor do they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to do any thing: but what is that to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose?
doth that excuse the Priest? or is this any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:65611:197"/>
at all to my Objection? He adds, <hi>Besides, its
all one to the people, whether they pay Tythes or no: as
I shall shew you anon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is his Answer to a syllable: In which, judge
Reader whether there be any thing serious, any thing
argumentative, any thing pertenent to the purpose;
and whether he hath not here evaded a serious Answer
by a petty Cavil against the Impropriators.</p>

            <p>But to return to the other Priest, the Author of
the <hi>Right of Tythes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. 10. In his next Section he taxes me with many
Mistakes in point of <hi>Law,</hi> wherein if I am defective
it is no great wonder, having never been educated in
that Study. He begins with a great deal of <hi>Mirth</hi>
and <hi>Ioke,</hi> according to the <hi>levity</hi> of his Mind, and
by and by slips into his usual strain of <hi>prophane Ieer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
and <hi>Flouting at Revelation,</hi> and Immediate Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
calling me an <hi>Inspirado, &amp;c.</hi> All which I let
pass as the <hi>froth</hi> of his Wit, in which no Argument
lies. The first Mistake he charges me with is in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
The Stature of 27 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. is the first Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
Law for payment of Tythes; <hi>wherea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
(sayes he, p. 183.) <hi>the very first Law in the Statute-Book
is a Grant for the Church's injoying her Rights
inviolable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was not altogether so confident and positive as he
reports me, but said, <hi>This is the first Parliamentary
Law that I find amongst our Statutes for the payment of
Tythes;</hi> which words [that I find among our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes]
he leaves out in reciting my words. Now if
it had, so happened that his <hi>sagacity</hi> and industrious
Diligence had chanced to have found out another
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:65611:198"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tatute of <hi>elder</hi> date than that I gave, yet met<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>inks
the <hi>Modesty</hi> and <hi>Wariness</hi> of my Expression, might
have won upon him to have pardoned such an Omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and thereby have oblieged me to have done
him the like Kindness another time. But since he
stands so upon it, let us see what other Statute he has
brought, and whether I am guilty indeed of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
in this case or no. He says, <hi>The very first Law
in the Statute-Book is a Grant for the Church's injoying
her Rights inviolable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then? Is there any mention of Tythes in
that Grant? or was it a <hi>Law made for the payment of
Tythes?</hi> Not a Tittle of Tythes is in it. How then
was this a Parliamentary Law made for the payment
of Tythes, when neither <hi>Tythes</hi> nor <hi>Payment</hi> are so
much as mentioned in it? This was a Confirmation
of Liberties to the Church, but not a Law made for
the payment of Tythes; nor do I yet think the Priest
will find (though he turn the Statute Book over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain)
any Law made directly for the payment of
Tythes, before that which I have quoted; which if
he do not, instead of fastning a Mistake in this case
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next Mistake he charges me with is, that I say,</hi>
This Statute of 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. was made by a <hi>popish</hi> King
and Parliament; Whereas <hi>(says he)</hi> that very Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
declares the King Supream Head of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> as <hi>T. E.</hi> may see if he read it over: And
how they can be <hi>Papists</hi> that have renounced the
Pope's Authority, I cannot well understand, <hi>sayes he,
ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He needed not have taken the pains to inform me
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:65611:198"/>
that <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. had assum'd the Supremacy before the
making of that Statute, since I had advertised him of
that in the same page out of which he pretends to
pick these mistakes (pag. 333.) where I say,
<q>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> 8. being more <hi>Papist</hi> then <hi>Protestant</hi> (though
he had transfer'd the Supremacy from the Pope to
himself) and believing, as most of the other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> so that of Tythes
being due to God and Holy Church, in the twenty
seventh Year of his Reign made a Law for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Tythes,</q> &amp;c. But that which he either can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
or will not understand is, <hi>how they can be</hi> Papi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Free-hold, and spends several pages about it, using
great earnestness therein, and calling me <hi>Heretick</hi>
for but so much as questioning it. I do not profess
my self a <hi>Lawyer,</hi> and therefore will not take upon
me to Answer all his Law-quotations, lest I should

or Free-hold in Tythes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this I perceive he confounds the Clai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s of

how and where <hi>Lay-men</hi> possessing Tythes,
and being thereof disseized, may have their Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
The words of the Statute run thus, <q>And be it
further enacted, &amp;c. that all cases, where any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Persons, which now have, or which hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Inheritance</hi> or <hi>Free-hold</hi> the Statute here intends
those Tythes that then were or after should come to
be in the possession of <hi>Lay-men,</hi> and appropriated to
<hi>Temporal</hi> or <hi>Lay</hi> uses; which implies it did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
Tythes an Estate of Inheritance or Free-hold
to the Priests, for then this distinction had been need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
Besides, the Statute sayes, The Person or Persons

Priest would gladly strengthen his Claim, by twist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

sayes, pag. 186. <hi>Those very Laws which made the

&amp;c. hath respect to <hi>Lay-men,</hi> not to the Clergy.
For although, in the second and last Paragrap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s,
where it directs the remedy for recovery of Tythes,
in case of substraction or detention thereof, it expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mentions Ecclesiastical as well as Lay Persons, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining
the remedy for both to Ecclesiastical Courts
and Laws; yet in the seventh Paragraph, where an
Estate of <hi>Inheritance</hi> or <hi>Free-hold</hi> in Tythes is spoken
of, there is no mention made or notice taken of the
Clergy, not a word of any Ecclesiastical person, but
those Terms <hi>[Estate of Inheritance, Free-hold,</hi> &amp;c.]
are expresly there applied to <hi>such Tythes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>as

of such Estate of <hi>Inheritance, Free-hold,</hi> &amp;c. the
Remedy was not restrained to the Eccesiastical

persons were concerned) but left to the King's <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi>

                  </gap>ay-persons,</hi>
into whose Hands such Estates were then already
come, or likely to come: And that the Law-makers
then did understand the <hi>Laity</hi> to have <hi>another</hi> Estate

            <p>
               <pb n="386" facs="tcp:65611:201"/>
The Author of the <hi>Conference,</hi> in his Vindication,
pag. 316. hath another trick to prove Tythes a

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ree-hold, and that is this; He asks his Parishioner,

                  </gap>y?</hi>
The Parishoner answers, <hi>The Free-holders. And
did you never</hi> (sayes he) <hi>see Clergy mens Votes entred
at one of those Elections? Yes many a time,</hi> quoth the
Parishioner. <hi>That very thing</hi> (replies he) <hi>proves
them Free-holders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, by his leave, the proving some Priests Free-holders
doth not prove Tythes a Free-hold. Many
of the Priests have <hi>temporal</hi> Estates, Lands of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
or purchase, which gives them a Right of

that in such cases, though they are Clergy

of Tythes being due to God and Holy Church,

to the true, antient, Catholick and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church; <hi>which the Priest calls</hi> Popery, <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi>
pag. 149. And as this Doctrine sprang up in
<hi>corrupt</hi> times, so it grew up together with the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi>
of those times; and the <hi>more corrupt</hi> the

the Church was <hi>most of all</hi> defiled and polluted with

was this Doctrine in <hi>greatest</hi> repute, and in <hi>fullest</hi>
force and strength. By all which let the Reader
judge whether this was a <hi>primitive</hi> Doctrine. And
as this was not a <hi>primitive</hi> Doctrine, so neither was
it a <hi>protestant</hi> Doctrine: for the <hi>Bohemians</hi> (whom
<hi>Fox</hi> calls <hi>Protestants)</hi> when they renounced the

reduced them to certain Stipends, as <hi>Selden</hi> out of
<hi>Io. Major</hi> notes, <hi>Hist. Tythes,</hi> pag. 167. which
they would not have done, if they had believed that
Tythes were due to God and Holy Church. Thus
it appears that this Doctrine, of Tythes being due
to God and Holy Church, is <hi>neither</hi> a <hi>primitive</hi> nor
<hi>Protestant</hi> Doctrine; and that the Statutes grounded
thereon, are built upon a <hi>false</hi> supposition.</p>

this is the Juggle. If they will claim Tythes
by these Statutes, they should claim them in that
notion wherein the Statutes suppose them due, which
is as a <hi>spiritual</hi> Right, not as a <hi>temporal.</hi> The Priest
sayes, <hi>A Father (having a maintenance reserved</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

unless any in the darkness of their ignorance should
so far mistake as to own the Priests for their spiritual
Father: nor in that case neither with respect to
Tythes, but to a Maintenance only) here are (in the
case of a Father) two <hi>distinct</hi> Title<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

declares it to be a <hi>temporal</hi> Right settled upon civil
and temporal considerations. But how remote is
this from the Priest's case! The Statutes mention <hi>no
temporal</hi> Right of Tythes to the Priests, but <hi>suppos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a <hi>divine</hi> Right, and upon that <hi>supposition</hi> command
the payment of them, as <hi>so</hi> due: This Deed of set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement
mentions <hi>nothing of a divine</hi> Right, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
a <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>temporal</hi> Right to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

claim a <hi>divine</hi> Right to this maintenance by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of <hi>this Deed;</hi> as the Priest claim a <hi>temporal</hi> Right

            </p>
            <p>§12. In my former Book, I inquired two things
pag. 335, 336. first, What it is the Priest claims a
property in? secondly, Where this property is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted?
in the person of the Priest, or in the Office?
To the first the Priest gives no Answ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r here, only in
another place, pag. 196. he sayes, <hi>We grant Tythes
are due out of the profits only,</hi> and with this answer he
<hi>contents himself,</hi> overlooking the Arguments I offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in pag. 335, 336, 338, 339. to prove the unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness
of such a claim; particularly, That <hi>if Tythes
be the tenth of the profit, or increase of the Land, and
they that settled Tythes</hi> (as he saith) <hi>were actually
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:65611:203"/>
sei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed of them in Law, then surely they could settle</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>more than they were so seized of; and they could be actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
seized of no other profits, or increase, than what
did grow, increase, or renew upon the Land, while
they were actually seized of it. So that such settlement
how valid soever while they lived, must needs expire
with them.</hi> This and much more such plain an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
argumentation, tending to prove the emptiness
and unreasonables of their plea to Tythes from the
Donation of <hi>Ethelwolf</hi> and others, the Priests, both
one and t'other, pass by unanswered. The Reader
may guess why.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second thing inquired was,</hi> Where this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is vested, in the person of the Priest, or in the Office?
<hi>This I perceive they are wonderful wary how they
answer. One Priest sayes,</hi> An Office is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vested in a property; and the present person who su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stains
that Office, hath this property vested in him du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his Life, with remainder to his Successors forever,
<hi>Right of Tythes, pag.</hi> 190.</p>
            <p>This, as doubtfully and darkly delivered as might
be, seems in the first part, to <hi>affix</hi> the <hi>property</hi> to the
<hi>Office;</hi> but in the latter part, to the <hi>person</hi> that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stains
the Office: For he sayes, The present <hi>person</hi>
who sustains that Office, hath this property vested <hi>in
him</hi> (not during his Office only; but) <hi>during hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
Life,</hi> which may extend far beyond his Office. For
if the present person who sustains the Office be an <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
vicious, debauched, scandalous</hi> Priest (as,
alas! too many of them are) if he be one of them,
who the Author of the <hi>Conference</hi> sayes, pag. 11.
will <hi>for a corrupt interest intrude themselves into thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
sacred Offices,</hi> he not only may but ought to be eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
They that for co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rupt Interest thrust themselves
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:65611:204"/>
in, should for their Corruption be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ust out again.
But what mean while becomes of the <hi>property?</hi> If
(as this Priest sayes) the present <hi>person</hi> who sustains
the Office hath this <hi>property</hi> vested in him <hi>during his
Life,</hi> the divesting him of the Office doth not divest
him of the property, because (according to this
Priest) the property depends not on the Office, but
on the <hi>person's Life</hi> that bears the Office. And the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder</hi>
of this property, which the Priest sayes is
<hi>to his Successors forever,</hi> can take no place till the
death of the present <hi>person</hi> who sustains the Office.
So that when he who sustains the Office comes to be
turned out of his Office, his Successor in the Office
can have <hi>no property at all,</hi> untill he that is so
turned out be dead, because he hath the property
vested in him <hi>during his Life.</hi> Thus stands the case
according to this Priest, wherein how consistent he
is to himself the Reader may observe. Now let us
hear what the other Priest sayes to this matter, in
his <hi>Vindication</hi> of the <hi>Conference,</hi> pag. 317. <hi>This
property</hi> (sayes he) <hi>doth not belong to either of them
apart,</hi> but <hi>the property belongs to the person, as qua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by holy Orders, and put into actual possession by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itution
and Induction.</hi> This quite contradicts the
other Priest: for if the property doth not belong to
either of them <hi>apart,</hi> then the present person who
sustains the Office cannot have the property vested in
him <hi>during his Life,</hi> but during his <hi>Office only.</hi> For
if he might have it <hi>during his Life,</hi> he might then
have it <hi>apart from his Office;</hi> which this Priest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes,
in saying, <hi>This property doth not belong to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of them apart.</hi> But if the property doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to either of them a part, what becomes of the
property when <hi>they are parted?</hi> The Priest it seems
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:65611:204"/>
(according to this Priest) has <hi>no property</hi> any longer
than he is in Office (though, according to the other
Priest, he hath it vested in him during hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Life) turn
him out of Office, and his property is gone, because
this property doth not belong to either the person or
Office <hi>apart.</hi> On the other hand, The Office has
<hi>no property</hi> any longer than it hath a Priest in it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the property doth not belong to either of them
<hi>apart.</hi> Where then resteth the property when the
Office is <hi>void?</hi> Doth the property <hi>cease?</hi> They had
best have a care of that, for that will shrewdly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger
the Title. Thus, Reader, thou seest, after
all their blustring big words for a <hi>property</hi> in Tythes,
they cannot agree where to fix it. A <hi>property</hi> they
would fain have (and <hi>nothing less,</hi> sayes one of the
Priests, <hi>will serve my turn,</hi> Vindication, pag. 317.)
but where to place it they do not know. To leave
it in the <hi>Office</hi> they know is dangerous, because the
Office was <hi>notoriously Popish</hi> when Tythes were first
settled on it. To fix it to the <hi>persons</hi> sustaining the
Office is no less hazardous, because <hi>some,</hi> at least, of
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ose <hi>persons</hi> are acknowledged by the Priest to be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders
for a cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>upt interest.</hi> But leaving the Priests to
consult anew about the settlement of their conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
property, since Tythes have so great a depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
on the Office, let us again consider the nature
of that Office when Tythes were settled on it. The
Priest sayes, <hi>Right of Tythes,</hi> pag. 190. <hi>I make my self
sure of that which none but a wild</hi> Quaker, <hi>would ever
so much as once suppose;</hi> viz. <hi>To be sure the office of
Priest-hood was</hi> Popish; <hi>and the Office it self being
n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w laid aside, the property vested in it must be gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with it.</hi> Thus he quotes my words; but, as his
usual manner is, very defectively, that he may
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:65611:205"/>
thereby find means either to abuse me, or avoid an
Answer. My words are these, p. 336. <hi>It was to be

make void the <hi>true?</hi> or cannot the <hi>right</hi> Office of
Priests remain, if the <hi>wrong</hi> be taken away? Or will
he say that was a <hi>right</hi> and <hi>true</hi> Office which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
here by the <hi>popish</hi> Priests, till the time of the
Reformation? Then he justifies the same Office still,
which is yet exercised by the <hi>popish</hi> Priests in <hi>Italy,
Spain,</hi> and other Countries. Certain it is that <hi>no such
Office</hi> was ever appointed by Christ, or known among
the Apostles. They had no Office for <hi>saying of
Masses,</hi> for <hi>praying for the Dead,</hi> that their Souls
might be delivered out of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> for <hi>receiving
Auricular Confession,</hi> and for many other things
which were the <hi>peculiar Services</hi> of this Office. These
things were not known amongst them, but sprang up

Masses, and pray for the Dead? Do these receive Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular

<hi>this</hi> to be <hi>their</hi> Office: how then are the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

which Tythes were given, and by vertue of which
Tythes were so long held and enjoyed in <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Reformation, was a <hi>popish</hi> Office, and as
such <hi>laid aside</hi> by the Reformation, no man I think,

Tythe from the remainder, and thereby first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seized
himself of that part, and by his own Act
given the Priest a Title thereunto. And although
the Law, supposing Tythe due to God and Holy
Church, enjoyns the owner to set it out, yet if he

            <p>This is not a parallel Case to Tythes: for in this

he has a Property in the thing he claims. But it is
not so in the Case of Tythes. If the Owner refuse

thereto; but is only supposed to have a divine Right,
and upon that <hi>mis-supposition</hi> the Statutes injoyn the

               </q> Doth not
this prove that the Parson's Title lies in the Gift of
the Owner? If the Owner sets out the Tythes, he
thereby disseizes himself thereof, and gives the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
a Property in the Tythes so by him set out: but
if the Tythes are not set out, the Parson hath no
Property therein; nay, if they be set out, and not
by the Owner, but by a Stranger, the Parson will
be to seek of a Property notwithstanding such setting
out. By all which it appears, That the Parson has
no Property in the tenth patt of another's Crop, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the Owner sets out that tenth part, and thereby
gives the Parson a property in it. Nay further, says
<hi>Shepherd,</hi> ibid. <q>
                  <hi>Tythes are not due, nor is it Tythe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Statute of</hi> 2. Edw. 6. <hi>until severance be made
of the nine parts from the tenth part.</hi>
               </q> So that to make
it Tythe within the Statute, it must be severed: and
to make the Priest a Property in it, it must be set out
as Tythe by the Owner. Judge now Reader, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Priest hath any other Property in Tythes
then what the present Owner gives him.</p>
            <p>§14. Here again, pag. 193. the Priest is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled

<hi>conscious</hi> to himself, that <hi>his Claim</hi> to Tythes is <hi>ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi>
and <hi>unreasonable,</hi> these two words did so run
in his mind, that he fancied he read them in that place

out of that page, with the occasion of it, which
was this. The Author of the <hi>Conference</hi> had
said, pag. 154. That <hi>Tythes were settled by those tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
were actually seized of them in Law.</hi> Whereupon I
thus argued, <q>If Tythes be the tenth of the profit,
or increase of the Land, and they that settled Tythes
(as he saith) were actually seized of them in Law,
then surely they could settle no more than they were
actually seized of, and they could be actually seized
of no other Profits, or Increase, than what did
grow, increase, or renew upon the Land, while
they were actually seized of it. So that such set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement,
how valid soever while they lived, must
needs expire with them.</q> Hence I further reasoned
thus, <q>Is any one so void of Reason, as to imagin
that they who were possest of Land a Hundred
Years ago, could then settle and dispose of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
and Increase that shall grow and arise upon the
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:65611:209"/>
Land a Hundred Years hence; which Profit cannot
arise barely from the Land, but from the Labour,
Industry and Stock of the Occupier. Were ever any

understanding and skill that God hath given him, of
the Stock he imploys, the Cost he bestows, the Care,
Pains, Industry and Diligence he exercises for the
obtaining of a Crop?</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This <hi>solid</hi> Argument
and sober reasoning he calls an <hi>old, silly,</hi> and <hi>blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

Argument. But whether it be either <hi>silly,</hi> or

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he has

also.</p>
            <p>§ 15. <hi>He sayes, pag.</hi> 195. As for Artificers pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tythes of their gains, it is no more than what they
are obliged to by S. <hi>Paul's</hi> Rule, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>This is</hi> not true. <hi>That Rule of St.</hi> Paul doth not
determine the proportion, <hi>but leave</hi> Artificers <hi>and all
others to their</hi> Christian-liberty, <hi>in point of</hi> quantity.
<hi>Therefore to oblige</hi> Artificers <hi>to pay the</hi> Tythes
<hi>of their Gains, is</hi> more <hi>than St.</hi> Paul's <hi>rule obliges
them to;</hi> Finally, <hi>sayes the Priest at the close of this
Section, pag.</hi> 196. We grant to <hi>T. E.</hi> Tythes are due
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of the Profits only; and therefore of God give no
Increase, or the Husband-man have nothing grow, we
expect no Tythes at all.</p>
            <p>Where's his <hi>Free-hold</hi> then! But if Tythes are due
out of the <hi>profits only,</hi> why are you Priests so unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to require Tythes where there is <hi>no profit,</hi>
yea, where instead of <hi>profit</hi> there is <hi>apparent loss,</hi> as it is
certain you frequently do. The Priest here sayes,
<hi>If God give no Increase, they expect no Tythe at all;</hi>
but it is easie to perceive what he means by <hi>Increase,</hi>
by his adding <hi>[or the Husband-man have nothing
grow]</hi> There is some difference sure between <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,</hi>
               <pb n="404" facs="tcp:65611:210"/>
and having <hi>something</hi> grow. He that sows
<hi>ten Bushels</hi> of Seed in a Field, and receives but <hi>eight</hi>
again (which that it often proves so many men to
their loss know to be true) is far enough from having
<hi>increase,</hi> when he <hi>decreases</hi> two in ten. Yet such is
the <hi>Conscience</hi> of these <hi>Priests,</hi> that they will have
the <hi>Tythes</hi> of that Crop, though they see apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there is not only <hi>no Profit or Increase,</hi> but a <hi>certain
loss</hi> and <hi>decrease</hi> even of the Seed, besides <hi>all</hi> the
Husbandman's <hi>other</hi> Charge and Pains. So that it
is not as the Priest sayes, <hi>If God gives no increase,</hi> that
they expect <hi>no Tythe</hi> at all; but if there be <hi>an utter
and total decrease,</hi> if the Husband-man have <hi>nothing</hi>
grow, <hi>i. e.</hi> if there be <hi>nothing at all</hi> for them to have,
then they expect <hi>nothing,</hi> but if there be <hi>any thing at
all,</hi> if the Husband-man have <hi>anything</hi> grow, though
<hi>never so little,</hi> if <hi>his loss be never so great,</hi> and he reap

               </gap>ot again <hi>the one half</hi> of what he sowed, and <hi>clearly
lose the other half</hi> with <hi>all</hi> his Charge and Labour, yet
will the <hi>Priest</hi> make his <hi>loss so much the greater,</hi> by
taking from him the <hi>tenth</hi> part of that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

by several Reasons, one whereof he, after his

in that of the Poor there is a settlement of certain
Lands, in which the Donor had a legal property at the

                  </gap>erty, and therefore no power to give.</hi> This
is the Reason, as he has maimed it, but in my Book
it stands thus; <q>In that of the Poor, there is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
settlement of Lands and Tenements, in which it
is to be supposed, the Donor had a legal property,
or of which he was actually seized at the time of
the Gift. But in the case of Tythes, here is no gift
of Lands and Tenements, but of the Increase grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and arising through, and by reason of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
Care, Industry and Stock of the Occupier,
which he that gave the Tythes neither had, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
could have any property in, nor was, or could be
actually seized of, and therefore had no power to
give.</q> This Reason is <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>solid,</hi> and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
a <hi>Shock;</hi> And I observe, that though he had
<hi>peel'd</hi> it as much as he could, and brought it in too,
with a <hi>scornful [forsooth]</hi> yet he was quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
<hi>to leave it,</hi> and take up one of his <hi>old Notes;</hi>
for he immediately sayes, pag. 197. <hi>We have noted
before, That by his Rules framed against Tythes, all
Donations made by</hi> Papists, <hi>on consideration of merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and expiating their Sins thereby, are void: And
this will destroy a great many of these Hospitals, and
Gifts to the Poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is not the consequent of my Aguments against
Tythes, but an inference of his own making to <hi>shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Tythes under. All</hi> Donations made by <hi>Papists</hi> are
not void, because <hi>some</hi> are. The <hi>Donations of Tythes</hi>
were designed to <hi>uphold</hi> and <hi>maintain</hi> a <hi>Worship</hi> and
<hi>Ministry</hi> that were <hi>false</hi> and <hi>Antichristian:</hi> but Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
to <hi>Hospitals</hi> for the <hi>Sustenance</hi> of the <hi>Poor,</hi>
had no <hi>such</hi> intendment. The <hi>Papists</hi> (as I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

            </p>
            <p>

endowed out of Tythes, and all Gifts to the Poor
granted out of Tythes for perpetuity, are void.</p>
            <p>What then? If men will give that which belongs
not to them, the fault is in themselves. Though
<hi>Charity</hi> be an excellent vertue, yet it may not patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize

<hi>Charity</hi> which is repugnant to <hi>justice.</hi> Now if the

               </gap>ad no power nor right to make
<hi>such</hi> perpetual Donations of Tythes as are now claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but that such Donations do <hi>violate the Rights of

large, pag. 323, 324, 325, 338, 339, 341. and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

            </p>
            <p>Athird sort, <hi>he says, ibid.</hi> of these charitable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,

               </gap>ual Rent-charges, and certain
sums of Money to be paid Yearly forever, out of the
Profits of some certain Estate. Now, <hi>he says,</hi> the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiers
of the Lands thus charged, must sell such part
of the Profits produced by their Labour, Sweat, Stock,
Skill and Industry, and when it is turned into Mony,

            <p>This he would make a <hi>parallel case</hi> to Tythes; but
it is not, as I have already shewed, Chap. 5. Sect. 5.
For this <hi>Rent-charge</hi> doth not lie upon the <hi>Stock,</hi> nor
upon the <hi>Occupier,</hi> unless he be <hi>Proprietor</hi> of the
Lands, or by particular <hi>contract</hi> with the Proprietor

               </hi>
who Occupies this Land and imploys his Stock upon

               </hi>
to pay <hi>for the Land;</hi> though if at the same time
he imploy his <hi>Stock</hi> any other way, he is liable to
pay Tythe of the profit of his <hi>Stock.</hi> But though
he make <hi>no Profit</hi> of his Land <hi>at all,</hi> yet the <hi>Rent-charge
he must pay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Priest says,</hi> He knows an Estate of forty
Pounds per annum, charged with the payment of ten
Pounds per annum forever, to the Poor.</p>
            <p>Suppose the utmost Profits of that Estate should
some Years (through ill Seasons, Blastings, or other
accidents) fall <hi>under ten</hi> Pounds, shall the Owner be
<hi>excused</hi> from paying <hi>ten</hi> Pounds? If not, he may
see thereby that the charge lies upon the <hi>Lands,</hi> not
upon the <hi>Profits:</hi> for what if the Owner make <hi>no
Profits at all,</hi> that will not <hi>destroy</hi> the <hi>Rent-charge.</hi> If
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:65611:212"/>
he can improve his <hi>forty</hi> Pounds a Year to an <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi>
he shall pay but <hi>ten</hi> Pounds out: And if he

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
he must pay. This shews it to be of a <hi>quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi>
Nature from <hi>Tythes,</hi> and therefore not (as the
Priest suggests) in any danger of being destroyed by
<hi>the downfall of Tythes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having now removed the Priest's Objections, and

               </gap>lear'd my Argument against Tythes from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
of Rent-charges, and other sums of Money
given to relieve the Poor, I cannot but take notice of
the <hi>seeming</hi> compassion the Priest shews of the Poor,
and the care he <hi>pretends</hi> to have of their Rights: And
considering withal, how great a <hi>self-interest</hi>

the bottom, it brings to my remembrance the Story
of <hi>Iudas, Ioh.</hi> 12. 3, 4, 5. and the account the holy
Pen-man gives of him, ver. 6. <hi>viz. This he said,
Not that he cared for the Poor, but because</hi>—&amp;c.</p>
            <p>§17. The next thing the Priest quarrels with, is
a <hi>Position</hi> (he sayes of mine) <hi>That Tythes are a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Burden than Rents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This he pretends to take out of pag. 343. of my
Book, in which there is no such. Possibly he might
deduce it from my Arguments in that place: but then
he should have so represented it, and not have called
it <hi>my Position.</hi> The truth is, the Position is in it self
so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> (saving that it seems to make Rents a Burden,
which simply they are not) that I cannot but like and
defend it; though I blame his over-forward and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome
boldness in making Positions for me. But
hear what he sayes to this Position, of his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
pag. 199. <hi>It would seem a Paradox, that Two
Shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ings is a greater Burden than Twenty, but only
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:65611:212"/>
that nothing is so easie, but it seems difficult, when it is
done unwillingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he has stated it, it may well seem a <hi>Paradox:</hi>
but state it aright, and it will not seem any <hi>Paradox</hi>
at all. It is not the <hi>unwillingness</hi> in paying, but the
<hi>injustice</hi> in requiring, that makes the payment a <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
In claims <hi>equally unjust,</hi> the greatest Claim is
the greatest Burden: but where one Claim is <hi>just,</hi>
and t'other <hi>unjust</hi> (as in the case of Rent and Tythes)
the <hi>unjust</hi> Claim is the <hi>greatest</hi> burden, be the sum
more or less. <hi>Two</hi> Shillings exacted where <hi>it is not
due,</hi> is a greater burden than <hi>twenty</hi> Shillings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
where <hi>it is due. Two</hi> Shillings <hi>for nothing</hi> is
a greater burden, than <hi>Twenty</hi> Shillings for <hi>Twenty
Shillings-worth.</hi> This is no <hi>Paradox</hi> at all, but plain
to every common capacity. And thus stands the
case between <hi>Tythes</hi> and <hi>Rents. Tythes are a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi>
because they are <hi>not just, not duc: Rents</hi> are <hi>not</hi>
a Burden, because they are <hi>just,</hi> they are <hi>due. Tythes
are a Burden,</hi> because they are <hi>exacted</hi> (of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
at least) <hi>for nothing: Rents</hi> are <hi>not</hi> a Burden,
because they are demanded for a <hi>valuable considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
Thus his <hi>Paradox</hi> is opened.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he is highly offended with me, for saying,</hi> I

            <p>I step over his <hi>Scurrillity</hi> and ill Language, and
tell him, <hi>first,</hi> If this be, as he sayes, a <hi>Slander,</hi>
himself hath made it a <hi>tenth part bigger</hi> than it was,
by stretching it to <hi>All</hi> men and the <hi>whole</hi> Nation,
which he himself acknowledges wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> spoken of but
<hi>nine parts</hi> of the Nation. I did not say <hi>All</hi> men and
the <hi>whole</hi> Nation would call Tythes a great Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
for I suppose some, in a <hi>devout mistake,</hi> may
be as ready to pay, as the Priest is <hi>greedy</hi> to receive
them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I am not at all Convinced that it is
a Slander, but do believe it a real Truth. And
though he sayes, <hi>Common experience proclaims me a
Lyar herein, there being very few Parishes, where
Nineteen parts of Twenty, do not pay their Tythes free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as any other due.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I dare appeal to <hi>eighteen</hi> parts of his <hi>Nineteen,</hi>
whether this be true or no. But since it is hard to
take a right measure of Peoples freedom and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
herein, while the <hi>Lash</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> hangs over
them, it were greatly to be wished that our <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
in whose power it is to decide the doubt, would
be pleased to determine the Controversie, by <hi>taking
off those Laws and Penalties,</hi> by which the People
are <hi>compelled</hi> to pay Tythes, and leave them <hi>wholly
free</hi> in this case, to exercise their <hi>Liberality</hi> towards
their <hi>Ministers, as God shall incline and inlarge their
Hearts.</hi> And truly if the Priest dislikes this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
it is a very great Argument, either that he
doth not believe what himself said but now <hi>(viz.</hi>
that nineteen parts of twenty pay Tythes freely) or
that he doth greatly <hi>distrust</hi> the goodness of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:65611:213"/>
               <hi>At length he takes notice of the Reason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I gave
why Rents are not a Burden as Tythes. The first
Reason he thus gives,</hi> The Tenant hath the worth of
his Rent of the Landlord, but of the Priest he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
nothing at all. <hi>To this says he,</hi> I answer, The
Heir of an Estate charged with a perpetual payment to
the Poor, receives nothing from the Poor to whom he
pays the Money; yet this is no Oppression, <hi>pag.</hi> 201.</p>
            <p>Though the Heir receives nothing from the Poor,
yet he receives the Estate which is so charged, <hi>under
that Condition</hi> of paying so much Money to the Poor,
which Estate otherwise he should not have had. The
He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> then doth not pay fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> nothing, although he
hath nothing from the Poor to whom he pays; for
he hath that very Land in consideration, on which
the payment to the Poor is charged. Thus the Heir
is safe. Then for the Tenant, he is not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in the matter (unless it be by private contract)
it goes out of the Landlord's Rent, not out of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant's
Stock. And if the Tenant, by the Landlord's
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>der, pays it to the Poor, he doth it in his Landlord's
name, by whom it is accepted as so much Rent paid.
But Tythe is <hi>quite another thing.</hi> For first, the Heir
doth not receive the Land unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> condition of paying
Tythe, nor forfeits <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the Land for not paying it,
neither is Tythe charged upon the Land, as the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Poor is, (of which see before, Chap. 5.
Sect. 5. and Sect. 13.) Then secondly, The Tenant
is liable to the payment of the Tythe, not out of his
Rent, but out of his Stock, over and above his Rent
and the Land-lord is not concerned about it, unless
any private agreement antecede. Thus it appears
his Instance of a Rent charge to the Poor is <hi>quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the business,</hi> and his Answer is no Answer to the
Reason I offered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="412" facs="tcp:65611:214"/>
               <hi>But he seems to have another.</hi> Again, <hi>saith he,</hi>
The Tenant receives as much from God, as he doth
from his Landlord: for we think, that Land is not
more necessary to the increase, than God's blessing,
<hi>ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor so necessary neither, say I, since increase
may be without Land, but not without God's bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
The Tenant therefore receives <hi>more</hi> from God,
than he doth from his Landlord: for from his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord
he receives Land only, and that upon a Rent;
but from God he receives <hi>All</hi> he hath, his Stock, his
Crop, his Health, his Strength, &amp;c. and that free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
As therefore he receives <hi>All</hi> from God, so unto
God ought <hi>All</hi> to be returned. God's wisdom,
counsel and holy fear ought to be waited for, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
in disposing and imploying those things, which
God hath been pleased to give. But what is this to
the Priest or to Tythes? Why, says he, <hi>upon that
consideration our pious A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What is God's part of the Profits? If all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease

to have but a part of the Profits? Where hath God,

of the present evil Opinions of the Church of</hi> Rome,
<hi>had their Original in those unlearned Ages, from about
the Year 700. to about the Year 1400. About the

the unhappy times, which bred and nursed up Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

some particulars, yet he said but a few Lines before,
<hi>At the same time</hi> (that Learning fell into decay) <hi>all

according to his computation of time (for the Rise
and growth of <hi>Popery,</hi> and of all manner of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
from about the Year 700. to about the Year
1400. his <hi>mid-night of Darkness</hi> must fall about the

<hi>this Law of his for Tythes was made in the very mid-night

that although this K. <hi>Edward, to whom</hi> (as <hi>Camden</hi>

was a man of great justice, temperance and
vertue, but especially Continency (for which it
seems, in that incontinent Age, he was Sainted) yet
that he learnt this Opinion (of the tenth part being

                  </gap>vil</hi> Opinions of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal;
which makes the quotation not much for the
Priest's credit. And truly, if it had been, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates,
an act of Piety in our Ancestors to give
Tythes and that upon that consideration, that both
they and <hi>their Heirs</hi> were Yearly to receive all their
Increase from God's blessing: they had done I think
but equally, to have <hi>left their Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

have acted in like manner from the <hi>Impressions of Piety,</hi>
rather than for the <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>Paternal Obligations,</hi>
supposing their Injunctions (in this case) <hi>obligatory.</hi>
As for what the Priest here takes for granted, that
the tenth is God's peculiar part, it is but an old <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish</hi>
Opinion (by which the World hath been too
long gulled) which never was, nor ever can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
with respect to <hi>Gospel-times.</hi> And to be sure,
when ever he pleads God's Right, he makes <hi>himself</hi>
God's Steward and Receiver. He says here, <hi>Now
the Priest is but God's Steward and Receiver; and if it
were true, that the Tenant did receive nothing from the
Steward of God, yet he might justly pay him Tythes for
his Masters sake, from whom he receives all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were some of Old, who, with as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>idence
and little Truth, affirmed themselves to be
the Children of God, as this Priest doth, that he
and his Brethren are God's Stewards and Receivers.
But the Answer which Christ gave unto them, <hi>Iohn</hi>
8. 44. is very observable, and no less applicable.
<hi>The Tenant</hi> (says the Priest) <hi>receives nothing from
his Landlords Steward, and yet he pays his Rent to
him, or to any other whom his Landlord assigns to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="415" facs="tcp:65611:215"/>
True: but two things first he makes himself sure
of. One, that the sum demanded is indeed his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords
due. The other, that the person demanding
is indeed his Landlord's Steward, or by him assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to receive it. The Tenant, though he pays his
Rent to the Steward, contracts with the Landlord;
and if at any time any doubt arises about the Rent,
they rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> to the Lease for Decision. Now if the
Priest would make any advantage of his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mile, he
should prove if he could) that God hath any where
declared under the Gospel the tenth to be his <hi>peculiar</hi>
part, which the Priest hath often <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g'd</hi> a Concession
of, but has no way to prove: for if we have recourse
to the holy Records, the Scriptures of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
from thence to be sure he can fetch no proof
that Tythes are God's peculiar part, since by his
own confession, pag. 67. <hi>Tythes are not mentioned in
the Gospel or Epistles to be the very part.</hi> Besides, the
Tenant, though the Rent be certain and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
is not forward, if wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, to part with his
Money to every one that <hi>calls himself</hi> a Steward, and
<hi>takes upon him</hi> to be his Landlord's Receiver. But
he expects a plain and satisfactory proof that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
so pretending is <hi>indeed deputed by his Landlord</hi> to
that service. Now then, if, according to this Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,
the Priest would say or do any thing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
let him first prove <hi>Tythes</hi> or the <hi>Tenth part to
be Gods peculiar due under the Gospel;</hi> and when that
shall be agreed on, we will, if he please, in the next
place examine <hi>his</hi> Deputation, and see how well <hi>he</hi>
can make it appear that God hath appointed <hi>him</hi> for
his Steward and Receiver. In the mean time his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious</hi>
and <hi>petitionary</hi> Pleas are neither <hi>helpful</hi> to him
nor <hi>creditable</hi> to his Cause.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="416" facs="tcp:65611:216"/>
But <hi>(he says, pag. 202.)</hi> after all this, the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>
is a notorious Falsifier, in saying, The Tenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
nothing from the Priest: for he receives his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and his Blessing, his Preaching, and other Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations.</p>
            <p>If the Tenant be a <hi>Quaker,</hi> the Priest is a <hi>notorious
Falsifier;</hi> for he knows full well the <hi>Quaker</hi> receives
<hi>none of all these</hi> of the Priest. The <hi>Quaker</hi> doth not
be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ieve the Priest's Prayers or his Preaching either
to be <hi>worth receiving.</hi> And for his <hi>Blessing,</hi> as the
<hi>Quaker</hi> doth <hi>not desire</hi> it, so he is so far from <hi>receiving</hi>
it, that he seldom goes without his <hi>Curse.</hi> Then for
his other Administrations (as he calls them) 'tis
well known, they that receive them, <hi>pay roundly for
them</hi> over and beside their Tythe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He comes now to my second Reason, which he
thus gives, pag.</hi> 203. Rent is a voluntary Contract,
<hi>&amp; volenti non sit injuria;</hi> but Tythe is not voluntary
now, but taken by force. <hi>To this he thus answers,</hi>
Very good! By this Rule then it appears, that Tythes
are not (as he falsly affirm'd but now they were) a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Oppression: for the generality pay them willingly;
and many Thousands contract with their Landlord and
their Parson to pay them as voluntarily, as they do to
pay their Rents.</p>
            <p>That the generality pay Tythes willingly, is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
Assertion contradicted by common experience,
scarce any one thing producing so many Suits at Law,
and so much strife and contention as Tythes. In one
sense I confess they may be said to pay willingly;
that is, they are willing to pay the Tenth, rather
than have <hi>three</hi> Tenths taken from them. So that
being under a necessity of <hi>bearing one,</hi> they chuse
that which they take to be the <hi>lightest Burden,</hi> and
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:65611:216"/>
               <hi>least Suffering.</hi> And if in this sense he means they
<hi>pay willingly</hi> and <hi>contract voluntarily;</hi> such Contracts
and Payments are much-what <hi>as voluntary</hi> as a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller's
<hi>delivering his Purse</hi> to an High-way Man
<hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>putting down their own Breeches,</hi> not out of
any great willingness sure, they have to be Whipt, but
because they had rather by that means come off with
<hi>three lashes,</hi> than by refusing so to do, suffer <hi>three
times as many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But sayes the Priest, ibid,</hi> All things are not
Oppressions that are paid involuntarily; for some
Knaves will pay no just dues to any without compulsion,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not the unwillingness to pay, that makes the
Oppression; but the <hi>injustice</hi> and <hi>inequality</hi> of the
payment. <hi>Iust dues are no Oppression:</hi> but his sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
Tythes a just due, is a begging of the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Rent is a <hi>just</hi> and <hi>equal</hi> payment, for which the
Tenant receives the value of what he pays. And
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ough the Priest says, pag. 205. <hi>No doubt the</hi> Quakers
<hi>could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ish rather there were no Rent to be paid neither,
and they voluntarily covenant to pay Rent, because
they cannot enjoy the Farm without that charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet no doubt he is conscious to himself that he
<hi>slanders</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> in this also: for it is very well
known the <hi>Quakers</hi> are as willing to pay their Rents,
(or <hi>any other just d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>es)</hi> and are as good Tenants to
their Landlords, as any others are, to say no more.
The <hi>Quakers</hi> know Rents to be just and reasonable:
and they do not desire to <hi>reap the benefit</hi> of other
men's Lands <hi>for nothing,</hi> as they are not willing the
Priests should <hi>reap the benefit</hi> of their Labour <hi>for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
In short, the <hi>Quakers</hi> do Conscientiously
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:65611:217"/>
pay Rents (and all other just dues) from <hi>a Principle of
equity</hi> and <hi>justice;</hi> as well as from <hi>the same</hi> Principle
they do Conscientiously refuse to pay <hi>Tythes,</hi> which
are <hi>against Equity</hi> and <hi>Iustice.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>The Priest undertakes to make it appear, that the</hi>
Quakers <hi>did voluntarily contract to pay Tythes.</hi> If
<hi>(says he, pag. 204.)</hi> Tythes be not mentioned in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
contract, then the Laws of <hi>England</hi> suppose that the
Tenant consents to pay them.</p>
            <p>This is a supposition of his own supposing, which
he grounds upon this Reason, that Tythes are a <hi>known
charge upon all Land;</hi> whereas Tythes (as I have
proved before) are a charge upon the Stock, <hi>not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Land,</hi> and are paid out of the Profits of the
Stock, <hi>not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut of the Rent of the Land.</hi> But if Tythes
were a charge upon the Land, as Rent-charges, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuities
and other customary Payments are, they
would then issue out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Rents, and the Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords,

Thus his Reason being removed, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            <p>§18. In his next Section the Priest says, <hi>T. E. comes

that I might expect</hi> Truth <hi>from him. That which
he calls my last Reserve he thus gives, pag. 205. viz.</hi>
That Tythes were really purchased by the owners of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states:
<hi>for which he quotes pag. 344. of my Book,
&amp; gives this for my proof, viz.</hi> They purchased all that
was not excepted out of the Purchase: but Tythes were
not excepted; therefore the Purchasers bought them,
and may sell them again; <hi>and says,</hi> If I can make
this out, this alone will do my business.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="419" facs="tcp:65611:217"/>
Although I doubt not this passage in my former
Book will give satisfaction to any indifferent Reader,
yet seeing the matter is proposed anew, I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to open it a little further. First therefore I
desire the Reader to consider <hi>What it is the Purchaser
buys. 2. What it is Tythes are demanded of.</hi> The
Purc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aser buys <hi>the Land,</hi> and that he buys intire:
no Tythe-Land, no tenth Acre is ever excepted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
or implicity; but he buys the <hi>whole</hi> Field or
Farm, the <hi>tenth</hi> part as well as the nine. But in this
Purchase he buys the Land, not the Profits or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
which by Husbandry and Manuring may arise
upon the Land in time to come; for they are <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi>
and the seller who makes him an Assurance of
the Land, will not undertake to assure him a future
Increase and Profit from the Land; nor were it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to expect it. Since then this is a Purchase of
Lands which the Priest doth not lay any claim to, let
us next enquire what it is the Priest demands Tythes
of. The Priest himself shall answer this, who in his
<hi>Right of Tythes,</hi> pag. 196. says expresly, <hi>We grant
to</hi> T. E. <hi>Tythes are due out of the Profits only; and
therefore if God give no Increase, or the Husband-man
have nothing grow, we expect no Tythe at all.</hi> Hence
then it is clear he claims no Tythes of that which the
buyer hath thus purchased; he lays no claim to any
part of the <hi>Land.</hi> Thus far then the Buyer hath
purchased <hi>all,</hi> the <hi>whole, every part:</hi> and the Priest doth
not so much as pretend a Right to <hi>any</hi> of the Land
he hath bought. Now then let us come to the other
purchase (if I may so call it) that out of which the
Priest claims Tythes, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Profits</hi> and <hi>Increase.</hi>
Of this in my former Book, pag. 345. I said thus,
<q>When he has this Land, if he will have Profit and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:65611:218"/>
Increase from it, he must purchase that after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner. He pays for that (and many times
dear enough too) by the Labour and Charge he
bestows in Tilling, Dressing and Manuring it. And
if in this sense he may be said to purchase the nine
parts of the Crop or Increase, in the same sense he
purchaseth the tenth part also: for he bestows his
Charge and Pains on all alike; and the tenth part
stands him in as much as any one of the nine.</q> Thus
then the <hi>Buyer</hi> first purchaseth the <hi>Land:</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the <hi>Occupier,</hi> whether Owner or Tenant, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaseth
the <hi>Crop.</hi> The one buys the Land by laying
down so much Money: the other obtains the Crop
by bestowing so much Charge, and so much Labour,
&amp;c And as in the purchase of the Lands, the Buyer
doth as really buy the <hi>tenth Acre,</hi> or tenth part of
the Lands, as the ninth, or any other part of the
nine: so in the purchase of the Crop, the Occupier
doth as really purchase the <hi>tenth part</hi> of the Profits
and Increase, as he doth the ninth, or any other part
of the nine; and after the same manner he lays his
Dung on <hi>all alike,</hi> he sows his Seed on <hi>all alike,</hi> he
Plows <hi>all alike,</hi> he bestows his Pains and Charge,
and exercises his Skill and Care <hi>equally on all.</hi> Thus
it appears that <hi>Tythes are really purchased</hi> by them,
by whom the nine parts are purchased, and do really
belong to them to whom the nine parts do belong;
whether Tythes be understood of Lands, or of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits.
If of Lands, the Purchaser doth as really buy
the <hi>tenth Acre,</hi> as any of the nine, and gives <hi>as much</hi>
for it: Nor doth the Priest claim any Property there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
If of Profits, the <hi>tenth Sheaf,</hi> or <hi>tenth part</hi> of
the Crop, doth cost the Occupier <hi>as much</hi> to the
full, as any other of the nine parts. Now seeing the
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:65611:218"/>
Priest says, <hi>If I can make out this, this alone will do
my business:</hi> I hope the Reader will find it here so
plainly made out, that he will be satisfied my business
is done.</p>
            <p>What the Priest urges as the Opinions of some
Lawyers concerning Tythes, is of the less weight,
because they are grounded on this Mistake, That
Tythes are of Divine Institution; which Error hath
misled too many. His Reflections on me (of <hi>Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
and <hi>Novice)</hi> I regard not at all; but pass from
his Railing to see if I can find any Reason from him.
He puts a Case (pag. 206.) thus, A. <hi>purchases an
Estate in</hi> B, <hi>of</hi> C, <hi>the Tythes whereof are impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atc,
and belong to</hi> D: <hi>Now will the</hi> Quaker <hi>say that</hi>
A. <hi>purchases</hi> D'<hi>s Estate in the Tythes, without his
Knowledge or Consent, by vertue of the general words in
the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>veyance from</hi> C?</p>
            <p>He takes for granted what I deny, <hi>viz.</hi> that the
Tythes belong to <hi>D. The Tythes belong to the Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
of the Land,</hi> to him to whom the other nine parts
belong; and he hath the <hi>same Right,</hi> in Justice and
Equity, to the tenth part as to the other nine. If
<hi>C.</hi> sells his <hi>land,</hi> what is that to <hi>D? D.</hi> doth not
claim the Tythe of <hi>that land,</hi> nor pretend a Right to
<hi>any part of it.</hi> What Wrong doth <hi>C.</hi> do then to
<hi>D.</hi> in this sale? or how can <hi>C.</hi> be taxed with selling
<hi>D</hi>'s Right, whenas <hi>D.</hi> neither hath, nor pretends to
have, a Right to any part of the Land which <hi>C.</hi> sells?
The Claim that <hi>D.</hi> makes is not to the Tythe of the
<hi>land,</hi> but to the Tythe of the <hi>profits;</hi> which Profits
<hi>C.</hi> neither did sell nor could. But after <hi>A.</hi> hath
bought the Land, he must to purchasing a new for a
Crop, if he expects to have one; else he may be
sure to go without. He therefore to obtain a Crop,
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:65611:219"/>
layes out his Stock, bestows his Labour, takes Pains
and Care, early and late; and in due time, by God's
Blessing upon his honest Endeavours, receives a Crop,
sometimes with Advantage, sometimes with Loss.
But although the Priest sayes (pag. 196.) <hi>Tythes are
due out of the Profits only,</hi> yet whether there be <hi>gain</hi>
or <hi>loss,</hi> whether there be <hi>increase</hi> or <hi>decrease,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be <hi>profit</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>no profit;</hi> no sooner is the Crop
made ready, but in steps the Priest or Impropriator,
and sweeps the <hi>tenth part</hi> of it clear away; although
<hi>A.</hi> had laid out his Money and Labour upon <hi>all</hi> the
parts of his Crop <hi>alike,</hi> had paid <hi>as dear</hi> for the tenth
part as for any of the nine, and hath thereby, in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
and Equity, <hi>as good</hi> a Right to that which is
thus taken from him, as to any of the rest which is
left behind. Thus the Priest's Case being opened
and answered, it appears that neither <hi>A.</hi> nor <hi>C.</hi> do
any Wrong to <hi>D;</hi> but that <hi>D.</hi> doth Wrong to <hi>A.</hi>
in taking from him that which he hath <hi>honestly ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed</hi>
and <hi>dearly paid for.</hi> And now the Priest may return,
if he please, to his <hi>A. B. C.</hi> anew.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he sayes,</hi> The <hi>Quaker</hi> fraudulently leaves out
those words of the Conveyance which would have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
his Knavery in this false Assertion.</p>

his shallow Reader should not see what follows in
the Deed,</hi> viz. [<q>
                  <hi>Estate, Right]—which I the said</hi>
A. <hi>have or ought to have in the Premises:</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>which

words</hi> (sayes he) <hi>do manifest, that the Purchaser
buyes no more Estate or Right than the Seller had to or in
the Premises,</hi> p. 208.</p>
            <p>He must doubtless have been a <hi>shallow</hi> Reader in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
that should have thought I intended the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser
had bought more of the Seller, than the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
had to sell; and I take it to be no Argument of
the Priest's <hi>depth</hi> to suggest it. The Seller had a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Right to the <hi>whole</hi> Estate, to <hi>every foot</hi> of the
Land he fold; and the Buyer hath <hi>the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But (saye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Priest)</hi> the Seller did not purchase
the Tythes himself, nor did they descend to him from his
Ancestors, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Tythes are not claimed of the Land, but <hi>of the
Profits only,</hi> or of the yearly increase of renewing,
which the Occupier of the Land purchases another
way. If the Seller, before he sold, had the Land
in his own Occupation, he then purchased the Tythes
himself, <hi>as much</hi> as he did the other nine parts of his
Crop. But to talk of Tythes descending from Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
argues the Priest doth not well understand what
it is himself claims. Tythes did descend to the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
from his Ancestors, <hi>as much</hi> as the other nine parts
of the Profits. But neither one nor the other can
properly be said to descend from the Ancestors to
the present Possessor, seeing both the nine parts and
the tenth are the <hi>yearly</hi> increase, produced (instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally)
by the <hi>yearly</hi> Labour, Charge and Care of
the present Possessor. That which descends to a
man from his Ancestors, is what his Ancestors were
possest of, or had a Right unto: But no man's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
could be possest of, or have a Right unto those
Profits of <hi>yearly</hi> increase which in their times <hi>were not
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:65611:220"/>
in being,</hi> but are <hi>since</hi> produced by the Labour and
Charge of another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he says, pag.</hi> 209. If <hi>T. E.</hi> would know the
Reason why Tythes are not excepted in the Purchase by
name, as Free Rents and Rent Charges sometimes are,
I answer, <hi>(says he)</hi> Free Rents and Rent Charges, &amp;c.
are laid upon Land by private Contracts, and could not
be known (unless they were by Name excepted) to be
due out of such an Estate: whereas Tythes were a
publick Donation, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This <hi>with some</hi> may pass for a Reason; but if he
were willing to give the <hi>true</hi> Reason, he knows that
as Free Rents and Rent Charges are laid upon Land,
and are paid out of the Rent of the Land, without
regard to the Increase that is made: so <hi>the Burden of
Tythes lies upon Stock,</hi> and is due (as he says) <hi>out of
the Profits only</hi> (without regard to the Rent of the
Land) which Profits are the <hi>Improvement</hi> of the <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman's
Stock,</hi> through God's B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>essing on his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious
Diligence and Labour: It were very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
therefore to except Tythes out of a Purchase
of Land, seeing Tythes are not charged on the Land,
nor claimed of the Land.</p>
            <p>§19. He quarrels next with a Demonstration of
mine, the occasion whereof was this. The Author
of the <hi>Conference,</hi> pag. 156. said, <hi>Though the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
pays Tythes, yet are they no inconvenience to him,
because he pays less Rent in Consideration thereof.</hi> To
shew the Fallacy of this Position, I urged that if it
should be granted, that the Tenant payes less Rent
in consideration of Tythes (which yet I said is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable)
yet the aba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e is supposed
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:65611:220"/>
to have in Rent, is not proportionable or answerable
to the value of the Tythes he pays; and thus I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
to demonstrate it. Suppose a Landlord lets
a Farm for 90 l. a year, which if it were Tythe-free
would yield 100 l. the Tenant, to pay his Rent, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray
all his Charge of Husbandry, and have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Subsistence and Maintenance for himself and
his Family, must (according to the computation of
skilful Husbandmen) by his Care, Industry and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
together with the Imployment of his Stock,
raise upon his Farm three Rents, or three times as
much as his Rent comes to, which will make 270 l.
and the tenth part of 270 l. is 27 l. so that if the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
should have 10 l. a year abated in his Rent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of Tythes, and he payes 27 l. a year because of
Tythes, then does he pay 17 l. a year in 90 l. more
than he is supposed to be allowed in his Rent. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
this the Priest both cry out, and make no little
Noise. And first, the Author of the <hi>Conference</hi> in
his <hi>Vindication,</hi> pag. 321. would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ain from hence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
That Tenants have really Abatements in their
Rents in lieu of Tythes: and therefore having first
(to shew how <hi>copious</hi> he can be in <hi>Scurrilities,</hi> and
what <hi>variety of ill Language</hi> he has to express him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
by) said, <hi>I perceive the</hi> Quaker <hi>begins to sneak;</hi>
he adds, <hi>An Abatement it seems there is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how doth it seem there is an Abatement? why
he is willing to turn my <hi>[if]</hi> to an <hi>[is]</hi> and strain
a <hi>Position</hi> out of my <hi>Supposition.</hi> But these shifts dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the <hi>strait</hi> he was in, and how near he was <hi>sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
that would <hi>catch</hi> at such a <hi>twig</hi> to hang by. Then
he excepts at the Demonstration for <hi>uncertainty,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I did not say whether the Farm of 90 l. a year
consisted in Tillage, or in Pasturage: yet he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:65611:221"/>
that <hi>the Tythes of a Farm of that value</hi> (90 l.
a Year) <hi>consi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ing in Tillage may be worth 27 l. a year.</hi>
On the other hand, the other Priest, in his <hi>Right of
Tythes,</hi> pag. 212. says, <hi>I believe all the Parsons in</hi>
England <hi>would compound with the</hi> Quakers <hi>after this
rate that the Landlord allows</hi> (that is, supposing the
Landlord did really allow 10 l. in 100 l. Rent.) And
in pag. 213. he says, <hi>What Parson did ever receive
27 l. per annum for a 90 l. Farm? Experience,</hi> says
he, <hi>teacheth us, that—we scarce every get so much
as 20s. for 10 l. Rent, unless where there is very much
Corn, but take the Church-Livings one with another,
and there is not above 9 l. a Year made of a Farm upon
the improved Rent of ninety Pound per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus they contradict one another. Neither is this
last Priest any more consistent with himself: for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the reasons he gives why they scarce ever get
so much as 20 s. for 10 l. Rent, he mentions <hi>ill pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
and <hi>conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alment;</hi> forgetting it seems, that
he had said but a few Leaves before, <hi>There are very
few Parishes, where nineteen parts of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

could there-from, as if it were a real and certain

            </p>
            <p>But did he ever know a Quaker that desired an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement
of Rent in consideration of Tythe to
be paid, or that accepted an abatement from his
Landlord, upon that consideration? If he knows
any such, let him not spare to name him: if not, it

Supposition, is this, pag. 214. <hi>The Parish of A.
yields in Rents to the Landlords at least 1000 l. per

            </p>
            <p>He did warily not to name this Parish, lest he
should be convicted of falshood. But seeing he says
they scarce ever get so much as 20 s. for 10 l. Rent,
unless where there is very much Corn: and that,
take the Church-livings one with another, there is
not above 9 l. a Year made of a Farm upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Rent of 90 l. a Year made of a Farm upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Rent of 90 l. a year, and gives the Parish of
<hi>A.</hi> for an Instance: to Answer his Instance, I return
him a Case which his Brother Parson gives in his <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi>
pag. 322. and says it is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eal Case, if they
dare believe one another. It is of a Farm Rented at
30 l. a year, which the Priest himself (as he says) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to purchase for another chose two Neighbours to
view and value. They, comparing it with other
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:65611:222"/>
Farms in the same Village, found it worth but 25 l.
a year, according to the Rates that other men paid.
This being objected to the Seller, he replied that he
who paid 30 l. a year was discharged from Tythes,
whereas he that paid but 25 l. had Tythes to pay.
Hence it appears, that the Tythe of this 30 l. a year
was rated at 5 l. by which proportion (according
as the Priest himself hath stated his Case) the Tythes
of a Farm of 90 l. a year come to 15 l. So that the
difference is but 6 l. in 15 l. between one Priest's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
and the other's, unless we take in the Parish
of <hi>A,</hi> and then the odds is above half in half. Some
other trifling Objections the Priest urges against my
supposed Case, as first, that I suppose Landlords bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than usually they are. Secondly, that I suppose
the Tenants get more profit than any of them actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
gain, or then (says the Priest) it is reasonable
they should: for (says he, <hi>Right of Tythes,</hi> pag.
212.) <hi>if the Landlord receive only one 90 l. the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
hath another 90 l. to repay him for his Charge,
Care, and Pains in managing, and a third 90 l. the
Tenant hath remaining clear Profit to himself,</hi>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>He reckons wrong: for if he thinks 90 l. will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
the Tenant his Charge, Care and Pains in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
a Farm of 90 l. a year in Tillage, and keep
his House beside, he is greatly mistaken; but if he
would have it that this 90 l. will defray his Charge of
<hi>Husbandry only,</hi> and lay the Charge of his House<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping
on the third 90 l. which he fancies the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
hath remaining clear Profit to himself, he will
find that by that time all Houshold Expences are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
for the maintaining such a Family as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of such a Farm will require, there will not
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:65611:222"/>
be much clear profit remaining. And yet I think,
how unreasonable soever it may seem to the Priest,
all reasonable men will judge it reasonable, that the
Tenant should have some clear profit remaining to
himself, to support him against acciden<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sses,</hi> to
enable him to exercise <hi>Charity</hi> towards others, and
to make such necessary <hi>provisions</hi> for his Family, as
may be suitable to his condition. But not to insist
too particularly hereon, I let the Priest know, that
his Brother Parson (the Author of the <hi>Conference)</hi>
is in this Case on my side, and against him. For he
says (in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> pag 321.) <hi>A Far<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of that
value (viz.</hi> 90 l. a Year) <hi>consisting in Tillage may be
worth</hi> (as he says, meaning me) 27 <hi>l. per an.—
to the Parson.</hi> This first, confirms my computation,
namely, that upon a Rent of 90 l. a Tenant had need
make 270 l. how else should the Tythe be worth
27 l. which is but the tenth part of 270 l. unless the
Priest takes more for the Tythe than the <hi>full tenth
part</hi> of the Profits? Secondly, this shews the <hi>fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi>
of the other Priest, in setting the Tythe of a
90 l. Farm at but 9 l. a year. Thus these Priests fall
one against another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But (says the Author of the</hi> Conference) Suppose a
<hi>Quaker</hi> enjoy a Farm of 90 l. per annum Rent, and
the Landlord abate 10 l. a Year in consideration of
Tythes. Or be it questionable whether he abate any
thing upon that consideration. I'le tell you what is not
questionable, that the <hi>Quaker</hi> will pay nothing, and
will pay this neither to the Landlord nor Priest, <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,

            <p>
               <hi>This?</hi> what <hi>this?</hi> this <hi>abatement?</hi> why himself
makes it questionable whether there be <hi>any abatement</hi>
upon consideration of Tythes, or no: and if there
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:65611:223"/>
be not an abatement upon that consideration, what
hath the <hi>Quaker</hi> to pay? or how is either the
Landlord or the Priest <hi>cozened</hi> by the <hi>Quaker</hi> (as he
unfairly suggests <hi>one of them shall be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re to be?)</hi> The
Landlord is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ozened by the <hi>Quaker's</hi> not giving
Tythes to the Priest: since the <hi>Quaker</hi> did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any abatement from the Landlord upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of such a gift. Nor would the <hi>Quaker</hi>
accept an abatement upon those terms, were t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Landlord never so willing to make one. The Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
if he hath a mind to bestow any thing on the
Priest, may take his own course therein, but the
<hi>Quaker</hi> will have <hi>no hand</hi> in it. The Priest is not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zened
by the <hi>Quaker's</hi> not giving him Tythes, and
indeed it were strange to think he should, since in
that respect he has nothing to be cozened of; for the
<hi>Quaker owes him nothing,</hi> nor has any <hi>trading</hi> with
him, by means whereof he might come into his
Debt. Thus neither Landlord nor Priest sustains
any wrong by the <hi>Quaker:</hi> for the <hi>Quaker</hi> pays the
Landlord <hi>du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to the contract between them. And if he <hi>pays
nothing</hi> to the Priest, it is because he <hi>owes him nothing,</hi>
nor receives any thing of him. But if no gentler

leave it to the Reader's consideration, whether of
the two is in reallity the <hi>Cozener,</hi> the Quaker in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing

§ 20. <hi>He in his 42. Sect. pag. 215. frames a
Quotation out of pag. 347. of my Book, and gives
it thus.</hi> The Landlord's dealing is far more merciful
than the Priest's; for the Landlord allows two parts
to the Tenant for his Charge and Subsistence; but the

there are few Landlords who take so little Rent as one

               </gap>z. That <hi>there are few

his Brother Priest shall Reply for me, who in his <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,</hi>
pag. 321. says, <hi>A Farm of 90. l. a year con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in Tillage may be worth</hi>

year to the Tenant, which being thrice as much as
the Rent, plainly shews the Landlord takes no more
then one part of three. To the latter part [viz.
That <hi>few Priests get so much as a full tenth part of all
manner of Profits]</hi> this Priest himself shall Answer
himself, who in his <hi>Right of Tythes,</hi> pag. 200. says,
<hi>There are very few Parishes, where nineteen parts of

If this be true, then there are very few Parishes,
wherein the Priests do not <hi>get of nineteen parts of
twenty the full tenth part of all manner of Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>fits:</hi> for
what should hinder their getting it of all them that
pay Tythes so freely! Thus, if this Priest dares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:65611:224"/>
               <hi>his Brother Priest</hi> for the first part, and <hi>himself</hi>
for the second, he will find my Argument is not faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
on <hi>either</hi> side, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and hitting one Leg against t'other, are themselves
become <hi>lame,</hi> and <hi>halt</hi> of both Legs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Answer that he gives is this,</hi> The very
same thing is done in Annuities, Free Rents, Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges,
Donations to the Poor, &amp;c. the Money is
paid intire, and no satisfaction is made to the Oc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>upant
for his pains in raising it; yet none ever called these
Oppression, till <hi>T. E.</hi> appeared, <hi>pag.</hi> 216.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>he thwarts himself</hi> again. He said but in
pag. 201. <hi>There are some indeed who cry out against
all publick Payments; and these do call not only Tythes,
but the Landlord's Rents, and Assesments to the King,
and R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lief to the Poor, great Oppressions.</hi> What could
he have said more plainly opposite to his other Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence!
Though for my part, I do not believe he
spake Truth in this Assertion, nor that he is able to
prove it by any Instance: Nor should I have thought
it worth mentioning, but to let him see, that when
men take the liberty to write any thing, <hi>true or false,</hi>
they seldom come off without <hi>contradiction</hi> and <hi>shame.</hi>
But to pass by his Contradictions (which are too
common with him to be much taken notice of) let us
examin his Answer. He says, <hi>in Annuities, Free-Rents,
Rent charges and Donations to the Poor, the
Money is paid intire, and no satisfaction made to the
Occu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ant for his pains in raising it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is false. For if the <hi>Occupant</hi> be the <hi>Owner,</hi>
he receives the Land under the Condition of such
Payments, and the Inheritance is <hi>satisfaction</hi> to him:
but if he be but <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nant,</hi> he either is <hi>not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>
               <pb n="433" facs="tcp:65611:224"/>
in those payments, (but the Landlord dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges
them out of his Rents or otherwise) or if by
contract he pays them at all, it is but <hi>as part of his
Rent,</hi> for which he has proportionably the same satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
from his Crop, as he hath for the other parts
of his Rent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Answer he gives thus, ibid.</hi> We labour
Spiritually for them, who take bodily pains for us: and
indeed the Parishioners give us nothing at all; but only
this Pains they take in making God's part ready.</p>
            <p>Doth he think that <hi>nineteen</hi> parts of <hi>twenty</hi> in most
Parishes, or <hi>nine</hi> parts either, believe <hi>Tythes</hi> to be
<hi>God's</hi> part, or make it ready as such? Let him not
so deceive himself. The World hath been <hi>too long</hi>
gulled already with such pretences; which might
pass for currant in former Ages, when <hi>Darkness co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the Earth,</hi> and <hi>gross Darkness the People:</hi> but
now that <hi>light</hi> is broken forth, which discovers they
are but <hi>counterfeit,</hi> and as really <hi>false</hi> as seemingly
fair. His <hi>Triple Plea</hi> of Divine, Donative and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Right (which here again he mentions) taken
out of the <hi>Triple Crown</hi> (I mean derived from a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Power)</hi> is already so fully Answered in several
parts of the fore-going discourse, that it would be
improper here to discuss them again. But seeing he
says, <hi>We</hi> (the Priests) <hi>labour Spiritually for them,
who take bodily pains for us.</hi>

               </gap> he speak it with respect to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I must
take the liberty to tell him, he speaks that which is
<hi>not true:</hi> for the Priests do <hi>not</hi> labour Spiritually <hi>for</hi>
the <hi>Quakers,</hi> but in an <hi>evil Spirit</hi> do often labour <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi>

being <hi>stripped</hi> of those necessaries, which by
the blessing of God on their honest Labours and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
Endeavours were provided for their <hi>subsistence,</hi>
have been reduced to great <hi>wants,</hi> and became Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of good Mens <hi>Charity,</hi> as well as Examples of
the CLERGY's CRUELTY. And hence have
the <hi>groans</hi> of many a distressed <hi>Widow,</hi> and the
<hi>Cryes</hi> of many a <hi>Fatherless</hi> and helpless Child <hi>(made
so by the Priests means)</hi> entred the Ear of the God of
<hi>vergeance,</hi> who certainly will repay. With respect
then to the <hi>Quakers</hi> the Priest's Position is <hi>false;</hi> and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ruly with respect to his own Hearers <hi>the reason of it
will not hold.</hi> For supposing him to labour Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
for them, as they take bodily Pains, for him, yet
inasmuch as <hi>he is not tyed</hi> to any certain proportion of
Labour for them (for though the Priest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> preach and
pray by the Hour-glass, yet I never heard they were
strictly bound to make their Prayer or Sermon just
an Hour long, neither more nor less) there is no
reason <hi>they</hi> should be <hi>tyed</hi> to a certain proportion
and quantity of Labour for him (which they are,
when the exact tenth is required of them) but that
they should be free, and at liberty in their labour
for him, as far at least as he is in his labour for them.

            <p>
               <hi>But, says the Priest,</hi> finally, Will <hi>T. E.</hi> say, It is

            <p>That doth not follow, nor can be fairly inferred,
unless the <hi>Priests</hi> now were under the same Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
that the <hi>Levites</hi> were under, unless <hi>England</hi>
were <hi>as fruitful</hi> as was the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> unless

               <hi>our Laws</hi> and Polity were <hi>the same</hi> with <hi>theirs,</hi> and
unless <hi>we</hi> had as plain and positive a <hi>Command</hi> to pay
Tythes as the <hi>Iews</hi> had. Tythes were <hi>suited</hi> to the

the <hi>Levites</hi> Part amongst them; so that Tythe with
them was but a kind of <hi>Commutation</hi> or Exchange for

men, but are <hi>equally capable</hi> of enjoying <hi>temporal</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
by Descent, Purchase, or otherwise, as the

was <hi>so fruitful,</hi> that with less then <hi>half</hi> the Charge
which the <hi>English</hi> Husbandman is now at, they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
received <hi>six</hi> or <hi>eight,</hi> and sometimes <hi>ten</hi> times
as much increase as Lands in <hi>England</hi> usually produce;
by means whereof they might with more ease pay
the <hi>full tenth</hi> to the <hi>Levites,</hi> then the <hi>English</hi> Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
now can the <hi>twentieth part</hi> to the Priests. Thes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Considerations, duly weighed, will make it evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appear, that although Tythes were <hi>not</hi> an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
to the <hi>Iews,</hi> yet they may be (and are) so
to <hi>us,</hi> who have neither <hi>the same</hi> (nor any) <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
from God to pay them, nor <hi>the same</hi> (nor any)
<hi>Compensation</hi> for them, nor <hi>equal ability</hi> to undergo
them, as had the <hi>Iews.</hi> And though the Priest says,
<hi>The</hi> Levites <hi>were ordered to take the full tenth without
any Compensation,</hi> yet therein he speaks not the Truth:
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:65611:226"/>
for they that paid the Tythes had the <hi>Levites</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>(viz.</hi> those Lands which would otherwise have f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llen
to the <hi>Levites</hi> share) divided amongst them: so that
<hi>they had a Compensation,</hi> Lands for Tythes. The
Priest's Argument therefore is <hi>fallacious,</hi> and his
Conclusion utterly false. He infers not rightly when
he says, <hi>If it be Oppression in the Priest to take the full
tenth, &amp;c. then God was the Author of Oppression.</hi>
The Consequence is not true: for in <hi>Canaan,</hi> where
God was the Author of taking the full tenth, there it
was <hi>no Oppression;</hi> and in <hi>England,</hi> where it is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
here <hi>God was not the Author of taking the
full tenth.</hi> Thus we see, that for the Priest to take
the full Tenth without making the Country-man any
satisfaction for his pains, may be truly called an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
and yet God not be thereby taxed with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Author of it. But these <hi>gross Absurditie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
the Priest runs himself into by over-hastily and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderately
catching up a wrong Conclusion, that what
was lawful, just and equal between the <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> time of the Law, and in the Land of
<hi>Canaan only,</hi> must need be so in all times and places
between other People and their Priests; not duely
weighing the <hi>different circumstances</hi> under which the
<hi>Iews</hi> then stood, and others now stand.</p>
            <p>Let us hear now how the Priest says the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is compensated for his pains. <hi>S.</hi> Augustine <hi>saith</hi>
(if the Priest says true) <hi>God gives us all the nine parts,
in compensation for our pains, in providing the tenth for
him,</hi> ibid.</p>
            <p>What a pretty <hi>Notion</hi> is this, neither confirmed
by Scripture-Evidence, nor backed with any Reason.
He thought (it seems) S. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s <hi>ipse dixi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
would have passed, but it will not, at least with me.
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:65611:227"/>
God gives us all the nine parts, 'tis true, but not to
reward us for providing him the tenth: <hi>for he gives
us the Tenth as well as the Nine.</hi> And as he gives us
<hi>all,</hi> so he expects we should use it <hi>all</hi> in his Fear, and
imploy it <hi>all</hi> to his Honour, the <hi>nine</hi> parts as well as
the <hi>tenth,</hi> and the <hi>tenth</hi> part as well as the <hi>nine.</hi> But
he that thinks God gives him the nine parts upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
that he shall provide the tenth for him, may be
in danger to be begged, and so lose the nine parts too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Another Conceit the Priest has to this purpose,
which he pretends to fetch from Sr.</hi> Hen-Spelman;
<hi>and that is of the</hi> sacredness of the number Seven, <hi>and
that by right</hi> God should have had a full se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enth part of
our Profits, but that in compensation for our pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s he
remits three parts, and so is content with a tenth.</p>
            <p>If this be <hi>true</hi> S. <hi>Austine</hi> was <hi>out:</hi> for he (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Priest) says, <hi>God gives us all the nine parts,
in compensation for our pains, in providing the tenth
for him:</hi> But this (taking no notice at all of the <hi>nine</hi>
parts) says, <hi>God gives us back three parts of our Profits
in compensation for our pains, and instead of a seventh, is
contented with a tenth part of our Estate.</hi> Methinks
the Priest might have considered, before he had
brought these two sentences together, that there is
<hi>some odds</hi> between giving <hi>nine</hi> parts in compensation
for the pains in providing the <hi>tenth,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd giving back
<hi>three</hi> parts in compensation for the pains in providing
the <hi>seventh;</hi> wherein not only the <hi>Clai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s,</hi> but the
<hi>Allowances</hi> also for <hi>pains,</hi> are very <hi>disproportionable.</hi>
However, if (as he fancies) God did give back to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he <hi>Iews</hi> three parts of their profits, <hi>in compensation
for their pains;</hi> then seeing the Husbandmen here,
in many places, are at well-nigh <hi>three times</hi> the pains

<pb n="439" facs="tcp:65611:227"/>
that if God did now require any such Tribute

For ten thousand Houses divided into forty eight

doubtless two hundred such Houses as most of these
are, with their great <hi>Tythe-Barns</hi> and other appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ge a Town as
most, if not as any of them. Then for the <hi>Glebe-lands</hi>
belonging to these Houses, there is no question
but their extent doth far exceed the two thousand
Cubits of Land alotted to the <hi>Levites</hi> round each

This in short, only to shew, that if the <hi>Levites</hi> had
Houses, and Lands about them, so have the <hi>Priests
now</hi> also, and that (so far as may be gathered) in
<hi>much greater quantity.</hi> So that the <hi>Levites</hi> having
Cities and Suburbs doth not at all abate the force of
my Argument, but still it appears that the Charge is
<hi>much heavier</hi> upon the people now, than it was under
the <hi>Levitical</hi> Priesthood: for if the <hi>Levites</hi> received
Tythes of the people, <hi>so do the Priests,</hi> and that <hi>of
more things</hi> than the <hi>Levites</hi> did; if the <hi>Levites</hi> had

then the <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

have the worst of it, but <hi>much more</hi> in that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:
for if the <hi>Levites</hi> had Cities and Suburbs, they
had not Inheritances with their Brethren; they had
not those Cities and Suburbs and <hi>the Share of the
Land besides.</hi> But the Priests now have not only
Cities and Suburbs (as I may call them) but <hi>Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances

this. The Author of the <hi>Conference</hi> (as this Priest
in his <hi>Right of Tythes,</hi> pag. 223. reports him) had
given two Reasons why the Apostles took no Tythes:

then askt this Question, <hi>Seeing the Apostles state of
Life was unfixt, who, I pray, fixed your state of Life?
who divided Provinces into Parishes, and set up Parish-Priests?
was it not a Pope?</hi> For this Question the
Priest derides me with a great deal of scorn, and says
<hi>(Right of Tythes,</hi> pag. 224.) <hi>Never did any man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>He were a knowing man himself, if he were able

in <hi>Crete?</hi> By whom? <hi>The Apostles themselves,</hi>
he says: but how does he prove it? He says it, and
that's all. Methinks since he judg'd I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
this, he might have been so <hi>curteous</hi> to have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
some proof of it. By which of the Apostles
may it be supposed that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> were <hi>fixt</hi>

as likely to have been the man, as any other: for by
his Ministry they both were converted to the Faith
of the Gospel, with him they seem to have most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed,
and from him they received those Epistles

Whether Parishes were divided by <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,

not worth Inquiery. I know the common Opinion
attributes this work to <hi>Honori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

my purpose, that whether Parishes were set out
and Parish-Priests fixt thereto, by <hi>Honorius</hi> or <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odorus,</hi>
it was done <hi>by the Pope's power:</hi> for either of

<hi>Rome. Honorius</hi> (says <hi>Bede, Eccles. Hist.</hi> l. 2. c. 18.)
<hi>received the Pall of his Arch-Bishoprick from</hi> Honorius
<hi>at that time Pope of</hi> Rome, <hi>and withal a Letter, in

the surviver might, by the authority of the Pope's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

as should be pleasing to God.</hi> This shews they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
their authority <hi>from the Pope;</hi> and what they
acted by that authority, was done <hi>by the Pope's power.</hi>
If therefore <hi>Honorius,</hi> as Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
divided that Province into Parishes, and set up Parish
Priests therein, it cannot be denyed but those Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
were divided, and Priests set up, <hi>by the Pope,</hi>

            <p>He speaks very like a <hi>temporizing</hi> Priest; but if
he were in the <hi>Quakers</hi> Case, he would be of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mind; for indeed he could not be in their case
unless he were <hi>better minded</hi> than he is. But <hi>are Tythes
a Penalty?</hi> What Offence are they a <hi>Penalty</hi> for?
Were Tythes then imposed as a <hi>Fine</hi> or <hi>Mulct</hi> for
some <hi>Transgression?</hi> The Party then, of whom they
are demanded, ought in Justice to be first convicted
of that <hi>Transgression,</hi> before the <hi>Penalty</hi> [Tythes]
be required of him. This is a new <hi>Crotchet</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tythes. I have heard indeed of a <hi>Penalty</hi> for
not paying Tythes; but I never heard that Tythes
themselves were a <hi>Penalty</hi> before. The <hi>Quakers</hi>
perhaps might be somewhat beholding to him, if he
would inform them what the <hi>Transgression</hi> was, for
which Tythes were made a <hi>Penalty,</hi> that by keeping
out of the Offence, they might avoid the <hi>Penalty.</hi>
But is the Payment of Tythes a Penalty only to one
that believes the Payment unjust (for so I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
him by the word <hi>[Opinionated]</hi> It must then
be the Belief of the Injustice of the Payment that
makes it a Penalty; and if so, then he that, so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
payes it, <hi>inflicts a Penalty on himself,</hi> which,
beside the Injustice is <hi>contrary to Nature.</hi>

               <hi>Again says he,</hi> I cannot remember ever to have read
of any sort of People in the World before, who counted
it a Sin to pay an Imposition supposed unjust; which is
no more a Sin, than to be Stockt or Whipt, to be Fined
or Imprisoned; all which we may submit to without
Sin.</p>
            <p>To <hi>submit</hi> to Stocking, Whipping, Fining or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoning
is one thing; but for a man to Stock, Whip,
Fine or Imprison <hi>himself</hi> is another: so to suffer for
not paying Tythes is one thing, and to pay Tythes
is another. This he sayes, and therefore cunningly
changes his Voice from <hi>Active</hi> in paying Tythes, to
<hi>Passive</hi> in being Stockt, Whipt, &amp;c. When he
speaks of the payment he says, If I were in their Case
I would <hi>pay</hi> my Tythes, &amp;c. And, I never read of
any who counted it a Sin to <hi>pay</hi> an Imposition, &amp;c.

it is no more a Sin, than to <hi>be</hi> Stockt or Whipt, to

<hi>Passive:</hi> for <hi>to pay</hi> is Active; to <hi>be fined</hi> or Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
is Passive. This <hi>Fallacy</hi> of his he thought per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the <hi>unlearned Quaker</hi> would not find out. He
says, <hi>We may submit to Stocking, Whipping, Fining
and Imprisonment without Sin.</hi> 'Tis very true; and
so we may to <hi>Death</hi> also: but doth it thence follow
that a man may without Sin <hi>put himself to death,</hi> be
his own Executioner, and kill himself? If it be <hi>evil</hi>
for a man to do this, how can he <hi>without evil</hi> do the
other? If he may not <hi>put himself to death,</hi> by the

himself.</hi> And if Tythes be a <hi>penalty</hi> (as the Priest
says they are, to one that believes the payment of
them unjust) he may no more <hi>execute that penalty on

largely proved before. They were a part of those
<hi>Offerings</hi> which by the <hi>One Offering</hi> were ended, and
so ended as <hi>never to be offered again,</hi> because the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of them again would have been a <hi>denyal of that
one Offering</hi> by which they were taken away. Now
as it would be a <hi>Sin</hi> to offer the other Offerings of
the Law, the <hi>Burnt-Offerings, Meat-Offerings, Drink-Offerings,</hi>
&amp;c. although commanded, so is it also a
<hi>Sin</hi> to offer <hi>the Offering of Tythes,</hi> although com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded

it be <hi>sin</hi> in them also that should <hi>act</hi> therein, or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi>

               </gap>
as of Old, this would be <hi>sin</hi> in him that
should so <hi>do,</hi> although commanded, as well as in him
or them that should so command. But if a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so commanded should <hi>refuse,</hi> and his Oxen or
Sheep be <hi>taken from him</hi> by force, or against his will,
and made a Sacrifice or Burnt-Offering, the <hi>sin</hi> would
lie upon them that thus command or Act, &amp; the man so
<hi>refusing</hi> would be <hi>guiltless</hi> before the Lord. If a
man should be commanded to <hi>Circumcise</hi> himself, or
to offer himself to be Circumcised, that man if he
should <hi>actually Circumcise</hi> himself, or <hi>consent</hi> to be
Circumcised by another, would be guilty of <hi>sin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, notwithstanding his being command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
But if he, who is thus commanded, shall <hi>refuse</hi>
to Circumcise himself or to <hi>consent</hi> that another shall
Circumcise him, and he be taken by force and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
<hi>against his will,</hi> the Sin will lie at their door
who thus command or Act, and the man himself, thus
<hi>refusing</hi> to act, or to <hi>consent</hi> unto the Act, will be
<hi>guiltness</hi> before the Lord. Now <hi>Tythes being ended
by Christ,</hi> as well as the other Offerings of the Law,
and as Circumcision; it is a <hi>sin</hi> to pay Tythes now
<hi>(and a denyal of the one Offering Christ Iesus)</hi> as it
would be a <hi>sin</hi> to offer the other Offerings of the
Law now, or to be Circumcised. And as in those
Cases, the being commanded would not excuse them
from Sin that should <hi>perform</hi> those things; so neither

the sight of the Lord. Hence it appears that to <hi>pay
Tythes is a Sin,</hi> as well as <hi>to receive them.</hi> And thus
the one Priest's <hi>false Position,</hi> and the other Priest's
<hi>most considerable Passage,</hi> are plainly and fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>
            <p>§. 25. <hi>His next Section treats of the</hi> First Fruits
<hi>and</hi> Tenths <hi>paid by the Clergy to the Crown,</hi> against
which, <hi>he says,</hi> the <hi>Quaker</hi> hath nothing to say, hut
only that this Power once stuck in the Tripple Crown.</p>
            <p>Where he found this he might have found <hi>more:</hi>
for in the same placo (pag. 355.) in Answer to the
other Priest, who called First Fruits and Tenths <hi>one
of the Faire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Flowers</hi> belonging to the Crown, I
said, <q>No Flower can be fair in an <hi>English</hi> Crown,
which was taken out of a Pope's Mitre. And if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else could be said against it, but that it once
stuck in the Triple Crown, that alone were enough
to make it unworthy to be worn in an <hi>English</hi> Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem.</q>
Hence it appears I not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nly had <hi>more</hi> to say,
but said <hi>more</hi> also against this Flower (as they account
it) of First Fruits and Tenths, than <hi>only</hi> that it once
stuck in the Tripple Crown: for I shewed, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken out of a Pope's Mitre, it could not be a
<hi>fair</hi> Flower in an <hi>English</hi> Crown, and that having
once stuck in the Triple Crown, it was <hi>unworthy</hi> to
be worn in an <hi>English</hi> Diadem. Besides, those words
<hi>[if nothing else could le said against it]</hi> imply there
was <hi>more</hi> to be said against it, if need require, and
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:65611:243"/>
opportunity serve. But this which was said was <hi>more</hi>
than he was willing to take notice of, and that <hi>little</hi> he
did take notice of, was <hi>more</hi> it seems, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, at least, thought fit to Answer. He
says upon it, pag. 230. <hi>His Majesty will not so easily
be wheadled out of so great a part of his Revenue, and
so clear an acknowledgment of his Clergies subjection to
him.</hi> What if he will not? Has this any appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of an Answer? or carries it in it the least shew of
an Argument?</p>
            <p>The other Priest, Author of the <hi>Conference,</hi> seems
to have something to say here, <hi>Vindication,</hi> pag. 325.
First he says, <hi>I do not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ind that</hi> T. E. <hi>answers the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
but catches at a phrase,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For my part, I see no Argument there to Answer,
unless he will call it an Argument for Tythes, that the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing hath a Revenue out of Tythes. And if that
were his meaning, I take it to be Answer sufficient to
such an Argument, to shew that the Tythes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
out of which that Revenue arises, are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ? But can
either of these Priests (or any man else, using his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding)
think it an argument of any force for
the lawfulness or Equity of Tythes, that a Revenue
arises out of them to the Crown? What <hi>Evil</hi> might
not, in other Nations, be patronized by such an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument?
May not the <hi>Papists</hi> argue their <hi>Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences</hi>
are right and good, because they bring in a
considerable Revenue to the <hi>Catholick</hi> Chair, as they
call it? Unhappy <hi>Luther!</hi> who saw not the force of
this Argument, but zealously notwithstanding <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
against Indulgences.</hi> May they not from the
same Argument infer the lawfulness of <hi>Stews</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi>
since from them arises a <hi>considerable Revenue</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:65611:244"/>
the Triple Crown? But though he is offended
that himself is compared to the <hi>Crow,</hi> for calling fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Was it so? Did it ever stick in the <hi>English</hi> D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then ever I read; and more I think than he is
able to prove. But both these Priest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> urge the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of first-Fruits and Tenths to be an <hi>acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Clergies subjection.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be it is so; but there is no necessity it <hi>must</hi>
be so. Is there no <hi>other</hi> way for the Clergy to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their Subjection but by paying fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st Fruits
and Tenths? The payment of Tribute is I confess an
acknowledgement of Subjection; yet not so, but
that subjection may be acknowledged <hi>other</hi> waye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
without it; what acknowledgement else would all
such be capable of making of their subjection, who
are <hi>not in a condition to pay Tribute,</hi> in which rank
a great part of the Nation will be found?</p>
            <p>Now to return to the Author of the <hi>Right of
Tythes;</hi> he spends the rest of his 47th Section in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
the Revenue the King receives from the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
which yet he doth so confusedly, that it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ard
to collect from thence any certain Sum for the Total
of that Revenue. The best account I can gather
from his is, that it is near 30000 l. <hi>per annum.</hi> Be
it more or less, it is not much material. No doubt
it is a large sum (if fully paid.) But what a vast
sum is that then, which the Priests receive of the
People, of which perhaps this may be scarce the
<hi>twenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th</hi> part, being usually paid by Composition
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:65611:244"/>
and at low Rates! But the stress of the Objection
I take to be this, That <hi>if Tythes be taken away, the
Revenue of the Crown is so much diminished as this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
to.</hi> The Answer is, <hi>Conscience</hi> &amp; <hi>Honour</hi> ought
to be preferred before <hi>Worldly Advantages.</hi> If the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the Crown are not found sufficient without

               </gap>is, there are <hi>other</hi> and <hi>far better</hi> Wayes of enlarging
them than by this. Were this <hi>Iron-Yoke</hi> but once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

would be certainly far <hi>more able,</hi> as well as probably

that the Crown would be rather a <hi>Gainer</hi> thereby,

            <p>He has as much need now as ever to clear himself
and his Brethren (if he can) from the Charge of
being <hi>Hirelings,</hi> since his <hi>Triple Title</hi> is disproved,
and <hi>he cannot make out a Right to Tythes.</hi> He talks
much of the Law of God, but No Law of God can
he shew for the payment of Tythes now. He talks
also of Tythes being due by the <hi>Law of Nature:</hi>
but that's a Position so extreamly <hi>ridiculous,</hi> that it
is enough to render him suspected for a <hi>Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

These two make the first part of his <hi>threefold</hi> Title.
The second part is the <hi>Donation of the Right Owners.</hi>

This is so far from being true, that it is utterly <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi>
it should be true: for Tythes being due (as
himself says, pag. 196.) <hi>out of the Profits only,</hi> they
to whom he ascribes the Donation of Tythe neither

Right either to Lands, Tythes or any thing else; but
do only <hi>conserve</hi> unto him that Right which he hath
already, whether by descent, purchase or gift, and

proved a Right, he might well have urged the Laws
of the Land to <hi>conserve</hi> that Right: but if he has
not <hi>otherwise</hi> a Right, he <hi>in vain</hi> expects the Laws
should make him one. Nor do those Laws which in

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:65611:245"/>
Tythes; but suppose the Priests to have a Right,
and therefore take care to secure that <hi>supposed</hi> Right
unto them. But now it appears that that <hi>Supposition</hi>
was grounded upon a <hi>Mistake,</hi> and that <hi>the Priests
have no Right at all to Tythes,</hi> but that all their Claims
are <hi>false.</hi> That they have <hi>no Right</hi> by the Law of
God, <hi>no right</hi> by the Law of Nature, <hi>no Right</hi> by
any Donation or Gift from the Right Owners of the
<hi>Profits,</hi> out of which (and which <hi>only)</hi> they claim
Tythes. Now the Reason and Ground of the Law
being, not to make a Right but, to <hi>conserve</hi> and <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure</hi>
to men that Right they have, if the Priests have
no Right to Tythes (as I have proved <hi>they have not)</hi>

            <p>But in order to clear (if it were possible) the
Priests from the just imputation of Hirelings, he says,
pap. 232. <hi>The people do not hire them; they set them not

Wages.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This doth but further discover the <hi>Vnrighteousness</hi>
of the Priests: for if the People do neither hire them,
nor set them on work, how <hi>unreasonable</hi> and <hi>unjust</hi>
are they to <hi>demand,</hi> yea and <hi>force Wages</hi> from them,
that neither hired them nor set them on work! <hi>Is
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:65611:246"/>
this to do as they would be done unto?</hi> Would the
Priests think it equal that any of their Parishioners,
who are hired and set on work by <hi>others,</hi> should come
and demand Wages of <hi>them,</hi> when as they neither
hired them, nor set them on work? The latter part
of his Sentence is a <hi>positive untruth.</hi> The words are
these, <hi>Nor do they</hi> (the people) <hi>out of their own,
give them</hi> (the Priests) <hi>any Wages.</hi> This is <hi>utterly
false.</hi> The Wages which people give them is truly
and properly out of the peoples own: for it is out
of the yearly Profits, and the yearly Profits are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>This is matter of Fact, of which the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>The Author of the <hi>Conference</hi> took another Course
to acquit the Priests from the charge of being <hi>Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi>

but seek for Hire from others. Out of this he
takes the first Sentence only, which was this <hi>[You
pretend to be Ministers of Christ, whereas they pretend
no higher, than to be Ministers of State]</hi> and passing
by all the rest, makes this Reply to that. <hi>I thought</hi>
(sayes he, <hi>Vindication,</hi> pag. 326.) <hi>that every Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
had been a Minister of God: St.</hi> Paul <hi>had ill

him, when he said, He is the Minister of God to thee
for good,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and beareth not the Sword in vain,</hi>
Rom. 13. 1, 4.</p>
            <p>That he may not have as <hi>ill luck in wanting correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as he fancies St. <hi>

<pb n="479" facs="tcp:65611:247"/>
               <hi>correct him</hi> before we go any further. He sayes <hi>he
thought every Magistrate had been a Minister of God.</hi>
In what sense did he understand the word <hi>Minister,</hi>
when he thought so? Did he think every <hi>Magistrate</hi>
was a <hi>Minister</hi> of God in the <hi>same</hi> sense and Notion
whereon he himself pretends to be a <hi>Minister</hi> of
Christ? If he thought so, he must <hi>think again.</hi> If
he did not think so, he doth but conclude and urges
this Text with a design to deceive his Reader. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his Comparison between the Priests and Judges
will not hold, their Cases are not the same. 'Tis
true that Magistrates are Ministers of God, but that
is as they are <hi>Ministers of State,</hi> as they bear the
Sword. They are Ministers of God in a <hi>political</hi> and
<hi>civil</hi> Administration, and so are called <hi>Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.</hi>
But the Priests pretend to be Ministers of
the Gospel of Christ Jesus, which is a <hi>spiritual</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
So that neither are the Priests Ministers
of God in the same sense that the Magistrates are;
nor are the Magistrates Ministers of God in the same
sense that the Priests pretend to be. Yet this Priest
says, <hi>Is not our Case the same with theirs?</hi> Not at all,
say I: for first, The Judges are what they pretend
to be: <hi>so are not you.</hi> They pretend to be <hi>civil</hi>
Magistrates, Ministers of <hi>State;</hi> and so they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed:
but you pretend to be Ministers of the Gospel
of Jesus Christ, and <hi>are not.</hi> 2. They are conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with that Maintenance which their Master, the

               </gap>ed them, and
seek no further: but you are not contented with that
Maintenance which the supream <hi>Spiritual</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
Christ Jesus, whom you (though untruly)

his Gospel, but hunt about for more. And indeed,

such <hi>very Hirelings</hi> are the Priests grown, that that
Parish which is able to give <hi>most Wages,</hi> may have
their choice of Priests, take them <hi>upon Tryal</hi> and <hi>hire</hi>
which they will. I do not herein discover a Secret,
but write that which almost every body knows. In

them and their Ministry. But if Tythes co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be proved to be due from such as hear the Priests and
receive their Ministry: yet it follows not that they
are due from the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who neither hear them
nor receive them. So that the Priests have a <hi>double</hi>
Task to perform: <hi>first</hi> to prove Tythes due to them
from such as do hear them; secondly (when that's
done, which c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

due to them from such, as are so far from hearing

them, that they altogether disown them. Now the
latter of these (which is the direct and immediate
Case between the Priests and the <hi>Quak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs)</hi> the Priests
have been <hi>very backward</hi> to come to, and have as
<hi>feebly</hi> performed (if what they have said in this Case
may deserve to be called a Performance) as <hi>faintly</hi>
undertaken. The first Priest cast it off to the <hi>Fag-End</hi>
of his <hi>Conference,</hi> pag. 161. and then too said
as little to it, as well he could: yet to that little that
he said (scarce fifteen Lines) I returned him more
than three Pages in Answer; to which he was more
wary than to Reply a word. And the other Priest,
in his <hi>Right of Tythes,</hi> when he came to this part,
where it behoved him to have shewed his <hi>utmost</hi> skill
and strength, chose rather it seems to l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a Reference to another Section, saying, <hi>This is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fciently
confuted before,</hi> Sect. 9. In which place too
he only touches it by the by, and gives an Instance
of certain <hi>Truant-Boys</hi> wilful absence from an endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Free-School, which is the <hi>only</hi> thing he here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
his Reader to remember. But what the Priest
hath said in that Section, and particularly his <hi>Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>action in the third Section
of the third Chapter of this Book, to which, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
needless Repetitions, I refer him.</p>
            <p>But although the Author of the <hi>Right of Tythes</hi>
had <hi>no edge</hi> (as it appears) to meddle with this part
of the Controversie: yet that he might not be <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced</hi>
by the Reader for a <hi>Mute,</hi> if he should have
wholely passed it by; he thought it expedient to
make a shew of saying something, and therefore
pickt out a Passage or two, on which he <hi>nibbles</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
First he says, pag. 234. T. E. <hi>saith, pag.</hi> 358.
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:65611:249"/>
               <hi>Some Ministers are Vicious, and such as the Apostle
hath exhorted us to with-draw our selves from.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is willing I perceive to make my Question a
Position, and I do not much matter if he do. The
Occasion of my words was this, The Priest, in his
<hi>Conference,</hi> pag. 161. said, <hi>The Minister is not to
blame for their separation, &amp;c.</hi> Hereupon I asked,
<q>If the Minister be one that for Corrupt Interest hath
intruded himself (as it seems by what he says in the
<hi>Conference,</hi> pag. 11. some such there be) If the
Minister be a man of Vicious and Intemperate Life,
of a Disorderly Conversation, such as the Apostle
has exhorted to with-draw from, is not the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stir
then to blame for the Separation?</q> Now I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
this Priest is so <hi>cunning,</hi> that he neither attempts
to <hi>clear</hi> the Priests, nor at all undertakes to <hi>resolve</hi>
the Question. <hi>Clear the Priests he could not,</hi> their
<hi>Corruption</hi> being confessed by his Brother Priest in the
11th page of his <hi>Conference,</hi> and that Confession con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
also even by National Experience. To have
answered the Question had been no less difficult; fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to deny that a <hi>corrupt</hi> Interest, a <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>

Apostle has exhorted to with-draw from, are a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </hi> and yet to grant,
that, where this Cause is, <hi>the Minister is to blame for
the separation,</hi> had been not only a <hi>Contradiction</hi> to
his Brother Priest, affirming the contrary (which
yet between them two had been <hi>no n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

even a cutting with his own hand the Throat of his

<pb n="484" facs="tcp:65611:250"/>
of an <hi>Answer</hi> to it, gives me a <hi>Question</hi> to answer;
which is this. <hi>But do not the</hi> Quakers <hi>separate from
good Ministers as much and as well as from bad?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I confess is a pretty Device to beg a Conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that <hi>some of them are good;</hi> but I will not grant
him that. Yet I would not here be misunderstood;
I speak not of them now as <hi>Men,</hi> but as <hi>Ministers.</hi>
I reflect not (in this place) on their <hi>Conversations,</hi>
but on their <hi>Ministry.</hi> Some of them perhaps may
be sober, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>versation;
but none of them are <hi>Good Ministers,</hi> because they
are not the <hi>true Ministers</hi> of the Gospel of Christ
Jesus, though they all pretend so to be. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised,
my Answer is plain and short, in the <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
I deny that the <hi>Quakers</hi> do separate from <hi>good</hi>
Ministers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds,</hi> A Vicious Minister may be a pretence to
them who resolved to separate however; but his Vice is
not the true Cause of their separation.</p>
            <p>The Causes of Separation may be to dive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Vice</hi> of the <hi>Minister</hi> to some, the <hi>Vice</hi>
of the <hi>Ministry</hi> to others; a <hi>debauched</hi> Priest to some,
a <hi>false</hi> and <hi>antichristian</hi> Ministry to others; and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these is <hi>Cause sufficient</hi> to separate upon. A
Priest's <hi>Debauchery</hi> is Cause enough to justifie a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from that <hi>Priest:</hi> a Ministry's being <hi>false</hi> and
<hi>antichristian</hi> is Cause sufficient to justifie a Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from that <hi>Ministry.</hi> And as that <hi>Minister</hi> is to
blame, whose <hi>Debauchery</hi> is the Cause of <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
from him: so that <hi>Ministry</hi> is to blame also, whose
<hi>false</hi> and <hi>antichristian</hi> state is the Cause of <hi>Separation</hi>
from it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he says,</hi> I belye S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in saying, he exhorts
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:65611:250"/>
the people to with-draw from a bad Minister; he bids
them not <hi>(says the Priest, pag. 234.)</hi> with-draw
from a Father, but a Brother walking Disorderly,
2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
            <p>Was ever poor man so hard put to it! how great
a <hi>strait</hi> must he be in, that would make use of such a
<hi>pittiful shift</hi> as this! Are the Priests got so <hi>high,</hi> they
disdain to acknowledge the People for their <hi>Brethren?</hi>
They learnt not that from <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> nor any of his
<hi>Apostles.</hi> For Christ was not ashamed to call them
<hi>Brethren</hi> unto whom he declared the Name of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 11, 12. And the Apostles in their
Epistles salute the Saints by the Title of <hi>Brethren.</hi>
Thus <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 12. 1. and in almost all his Epistles.
Thus <hi>Iames,</hi> chap. 1. vers. 2. Thus <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Epist.
1. 10. Thus <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1 Epist. 2. 7. Nor is any <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation</hi>
more frequent in their Writings, than this
of <hi>Brethren.</hi> Yea, in that very place wherein <hi>Paul</hi>
gives this monitory Counsel to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> he
calls them <hi>Brethren.</hi> And says the Divine <hi>Iohn</hi> to the
Churches of <hi>Asia, I am your Brother, &amp;c.</hi> Rev. 1. 9.
The Apostles then and the rest of the Saints were
<hi>Brethren</hi> it seems, and yet saith <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,
Now we command you, Brethren, in the
Name of our Lord Iesus Christ, that ye with-draw
your selves from every Brother that walketh disorderly,
&amp;c.</hi> From <hi>every Brother!</hi> Either then the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
must not be a <hi>Brother,</hi> or, if he walk <hi>disorderly,</hi>
must be <hi>with-drawn from,</hi> although he be a <hi>Minister.</hi>
Besides, what were those false Teachers that troubled
the Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> and <hi>Corinth?</hi> were they
not <hi>bad Ministers?</hi> Did not <hi>Paul</hi> wish <hi>they were even
cut off,</hi> Gal. 5. 12? And can any one think he would
not have had the <hi>Galatians</hi> with-draw from them?
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:65611:251"/>
But I do not at all wonder <hi>this Priest</hi> is so unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the people should with-draw from a <hi>bad Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next he says,</hi> I run again into my old Mist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Christ's Directions to his Disciples on a private
Mission to Vnbelievers, as if it were a standing Rule
for Ministers amongst Believers.</p>
            <p>This he draws from a close Expostulation with the
other Priest himself, thus, <q>He pretends to be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Christ. Where did Christ e're impower hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to make people hear them, whether they will
or no? or to exact Wages of them although they
did not hear them? His Instruction to his Disciples
was, Whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear
your Words, shake off the Dust of your Feet,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 14,</q> The first part of this the Priest steps
over. The latter part he says is my old Mistake.
Whether it be a Mistake or no will appear. I ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
it to shew that the Apostles were not directed
to press and pin their preaching upon any, but to
<hi>shake off the Dust of their Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> against those that should
not receive nor hear their Words. This he says was
<hi>Christ's Direction to his Disciples upon a private Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on
to Vnbelievers,</hi> and he calls it <hi>my Mistake to apply
this as if it were a standing Rule for Ministers among
believe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

Mission, as he calls it, <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Barnabas</hi> who were
not imployed in that Missi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n, nor converted to God
till afterward, had had no share in this Direction,
nor any Commission to use it. Yet they, we see, long
after Christ's Ascention, did punctually observe this
Direction, <hi>shaking off the Dust of their Feet at</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch
against those that rejected their Testimony,
<hi>Acts</hi> 13. 51. So that this Direction had relation to
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:65611:251"/>
the <hi>general</hi> Commission, as well as to that <hi>particular</hi>
Mission, which he calls <hi>private;</hi> and the Mistake,
whether <hi>old</hi> or <hi>new,</hi> is his own, in restraining it to that
particular Mission.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the next place he says,</hi> I compare the <hi>Quakers,</hi>
in rejecting their Ministry, to the <hi>Jews</hi> who rejected the
Apostles, and judged themselves unworthy of eternal
Life, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 46.</p>
            <p>This is a very <hi>silly Catch,</hi> and hath neither <hi>Truth</hi>
nor <hi>Wit</hi> in it. I made no Comparison at all; but
shewed from that Text, that the <hi>practice</hi> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
was <hi>consonant</hi> to the <hi>Instruction</hi> of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.
They <hi>preach</hi> the Gospel to the <hi>Iews.</hi> The
<hi>Iews reject</hi> it. They do not say, <hi>You shall hear it whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you will or no;</hi> or however <hi>you shall pay us for
Preaching it:</hi> but they <hi>turn from</hi> them, and offer
their Message unto <hi>others.</hi> Hereupon I said (in <hi>Truth
prevailing,</hi> pag. 359.) <q>He greatly mistake, if h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

thinks it to be the mind of Christ to impose his
Gospel upon any, or, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are said to
have dealt with the <hi>Indians,</hi> to make men <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
whether they will or no: Nay, nay; he loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
invites all; he inwardly strives by his Spirit with
all; he graciously tenders Mercy to all; but he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudes
it upon none. And if he gave no Authority
to his Apostles to compel any to hear them; to be
sure he gave them no power to demand, much less
Inforce a Maintenance from such, as did neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
nor own them.</q> Out of this last Sentence
(passing over the rest) he frames this Quotation for
me; <hi>Christ gave his Apostles no Authority to compel
any to hear them.</hi> He replies, <hi>Yes surely, he bid the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

by <hi>fair</hi> means, and by <hi>foul.</hi> By <hi>fair</hi> means,
as by Entreaty, Perswasion, Reason, Love, &amp;c. By
<hi>foul</hi> means, as by the severity and sharpness of Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
whether corporal or pecuniary. He that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
not this distinction may easily err. Of the
<hi>first sort</hi> of Compulsion Instances in Scripture are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.
When Christ, immediately after his Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
appeared to those two Disciples of his that

Village, it is said, <hi>Luke 24. 28, 29. He made as
though he would have gone further; but they</hi> CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STRAINED
<hi>him,—and he went in to tarry with
them.</hi> Now what manner of <hi>Compulsion</hi> was this?
how did they <hi>constrain</hi> him; by <hi>fair</hi> means or by
<hi>foul?</hi> The Text expresses how. First, by a <hi>kind In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation,</hi>
saying, <hi>Abide with us.</hi> Secondly, by ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<hi>reasons</hi> why he should abide with them, <hi>For it
is towards Evening, and the day is far spent.</hi> In like
manner, when <hi>Lydia's</hi> Heart was opened, she <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained</hi>
the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> and his company to come
into her House, and abide there. Here again we
see is <hi>compulsion;</hi> but of what kind, what nature?
by what means? <hi>fair? or foul?</hi> By <hi>entreaty.</hi> Read
the Text, <hi>Acts 16. 15. And when she was Baptized,
and her Houshold, she besought us, saying, If ye have
judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my House
and abide there. And she</hi> CONSTRAINED <hi>us.</hi>

by the word <hi>Compel.</hi> The Parable is of a certain
Man, that made a great Supper, and bad (or invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)

not. The Master therefore of the House bids his

more, the Master sends his Servant again, saying,
<hi>Go out into the High-ways and Hedges, and compel
them to come in, that my House may be filled. For I
say unto you, that none of those men which were bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

had no better provision than they could get from the

a good Supper.</hi> If <hi>outward force and violence</hi> had
been to be used, it seems more reasonable that it
should have been exercised on them that were invited
and did not come: but they we see were so far from
suffering any such <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>penal compulsion,</hi> that
after refusal, they were <hi>utterly excluded</hi> from the
Feast; the Master of the House saying expresly,
<hi>None of those men which were bidden, shall taste of my
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:65611:253"/>
Supper,</hi> vers. 24. So that they that <hi>refused</hi> to come
to the Feast, were <hi>not fetched in by force:</hi> their <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi>
was to be <hi>shut out.</hi> And if the others who
were brought out of the Streets, Lanes, Highways

as those did, there had been the <hi>same reason</hi> to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ave
<hi>shut them out</hi> also, as there was to shut out the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
but no more reason to have exercised <hi>violence</hi>
towards these, than towards the former, upon
whom for refusing to come, we do not find that any
was used. But if these, that were brought from the
Highways and Hedges, did <hi>not refuse,</hi> but readily
came at the Call, there was then no <hi>need</hi> of (nor
room for) any such <hi>forcible, violent</hi> and <hi>penal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion,</hi>
as the Priest here speaks of.</p>
            <p>But to make it more evident that our Saviour in

were the <hi>same sort</hi> of Guests, mentioned by <hi>Luke,</hi>
who were in the Highways and Hedges; and yet we

Servants to use any other <hi>Compulsion</hi> to them, than
an <hi>Invitation: As many as ye shall find, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="491" facs="tcp:65611:253"/>
Besides, if we look further into the Parable, we
shall find that when the King, taking a view of his
Guests, <hi>saw one there which had not on a wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and asked him, <hi>Friend, how camest thou in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
not having on a Wedding Garment. The man
was speechless,</hi> and the King commanded his Servants
to <hi>bind that man Hand and Foot, and cast him into
utter Darkness.</hi> Which plainly proves he was not
brought in <hi>against his Will,</hi> he was not <hi>driven in by
force,</hi> nor <hi>dragged in</hi> by Head and Shoulders, for if
he had, he had then had a <hi>fair Plea</hi> to make, a <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Answer</hi> to return to the Question, <hi>How camest
thou in hither,</hi> &amp;c? <hi>I was driven in by stripes, I was
drawn in by force, I was brought in against my will,</hi>
might he have said. Had it been so, he needed not
have been <hi>speechless,</hi> as it seems he was. And how,
again, could it have stood with the <hi>divine justice</hi> of
that great King to sentence a man to be <hi>bound and
cast into utter Darkness,</hi> for coming in thither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Wedding Garment, if the man had been <hi>brought
in by force, against his own mind,</hi> and that too <hi>by his
Command.</hi> But it is manifest that no such <hi>forcible,
violent, penal Compulsion</hi> as the Priest aims at, was
commanded or intended by our Saviour in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
and consequently that the word <hi>[compel]</hi> in
this place <hi>(Luke</hi> 14. 23.) is <hi>misunderstood,</hi> at least
<hi>misapplied</hi> by the Priest, and his <hi>Yes surely</hi> is surely
false.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he urges the Judgment of</hi> Augustine, That

Charity to their Souls, yea a duty of</hi> Christian <hi>Princes.</hi>
First, who shall judge whether the thing to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to, is <hi>good</hi> or no; <hi>They</hi> that are <hi>to be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
or <hi>he</hi> that is to <hi>compel?</hi> If they that are to be
compelled may judge, it is not likely that they should
judge that good which they must be compelled to;
for if they judged it good, they would not need to
be compelled to it. If he that is to compel must
judge, then whatsoever he shall judge to be good
(be it never so bad) that must bear the name of
Good, and all must be compelled to receive it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
concerning <hi>Christian</hi> Princes the like dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
may arise. Possibly they who are compelled
to that as Good, which they believe is not good,
may question whether they are <hi>Christian</hi> Princes
that so compel. On the other hand, what Prince is
there throughout that part of the World which is
called <hi>Christendom,</hi> that is not ready on all Occasions
to assert himself a <hi>Christian</hi> Prince? Now therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

if every one that holds himself a <hi>Christian</hi> Prince
not only lawfully may, but also, both in point of
duty and as an Act of necessary Charity to the
Souls of others, ought to compel men to that
which he judges good, what hinders then but

he, whose Ancestors received from <hi>Rome</hi> the Title of
<hi>Most Christian King,</hi> and who professeth himself a

(according to this Position) both as his <hi>own duty,</hi> and
as an Act of <hi>necessary Charity</hi> to their Souls, compel
all <hi>Protestants</hi> in his Dominions to the <hi>Romish</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which he judges good? Thus, Reader, thou
seest the horrid Consequence of this false and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi>
Position. But this is the <hi>old Argument of
the Papists,</hi> long since exploded and detested by men
of Reason and Ingenuity, though sometimes, as now,

But besides this, is it all true that the Priest says
here? Do they descend by these steps to their
<hi>Church-Censures</hi> and <hi>secular</hi> Complaint? Do they
<hi>admonish?</hi> Do they <hi>warn?</hi> Do they ever attempt to
<hi>convince</hi> by Arguments? Whom of a thousand is lie
able to name for an <hi>Instance</hi> of such procedure? yet
he says, <hi>This is no more than S.</hi> Paul <hi>threatned,</hi>

Corinthian <hi>to Satan, punishing his outward
man for the health of his Soul,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 5.</p>
            <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> indeed, did admonish often, did warn
frequently, did labour to convince by Arguments,
and that earnestly; but I never read before that <hi>he
complained to the secular Mag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>rate,</hi> or so much as
threatned so to do. I am sure the Scriptures he hath
quoted will not justifie this Assertion. But if S. <hi>Paul</hi>
did not complain to the secular Magistrate, then this,
which the Priests confesses they do, is <hi>more than S.</hi>
Paul <hi>did,</hi> and the Priest, in saying it is no more, is
found in a <hi>downright Falshood.</hi> But to proceed.</p>
            <p>I said in Answer to the former Priest, <q>If
Christ gave no Authority to his Apostles to compel
any to hear them; to be sure he gave them no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to demand, much less Inforce a Maintenance
from such as did neither receive nor own them.</q>
This the latter Priest transfers from the Apostles to
himself and his Brethren, and makes a quotation out
of it, with which he begins his 50th Section thus,
<hi>He adds,</hi> pag. 359. <hi>Christ gave us no power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
a Maintenance from those who do not receive us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I perceive he is willing to creep in any how: but
unless he had come in fairer, he is like to <hi>turn out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi>
I do not admit that Christ hath given <hi>him</hi>
power to demand Maintenance of any body, no not
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:65611:255"/>
of them that do receive him: for Christ gives Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

               </gap>ends, of
which number he is none. However, I observe he
doth not deny what I said [viz. <hi>That Christ ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to grant it: for he replies, <hi>Nor do we demand of the</hi>
Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>akers <hi>to give us one single Penny more than what was
given to us, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ttled on us many hundred years ago:
we only ask our own; we only ask that which the</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<hi>did not take of his Landlord, that which was or
ought to have been abated in his Rent,</hi> p. 338.</p>
            <p>Don't you demand of the <hi>Quakers</hi> the tenth part
of <hi>their</hi> yearly Profits? Could these be settled on
you many hundred years ago! The <hi>Folly</hi> of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is obvious of it self. But how many hundred
years is it, I pray, since Tythes were settled <hi>on you?</hi>
'Tis but about 140 years ago since the <hi>first</hi> Statute-Law
for Tythes was made, and that too was made
both by <hi>Papists</hi> and for <hi>Papists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he says,</hi> They only ask that which the <hi>Quaker</hi>
did not take of his Landlord.</p>
            <p>They not only ask that which the <hi>Quaker</hi> did not
take of his Landlord, but they also ask it out of that
which the <hi>Quaker</hi> did not take of his Landlord, <hi>viz.
out of the Profits:</hi> for out of the Profits <hi>only</hi> are
Tythes due, says this Priest, pag. 196. Now the
<hi>Quaker</hi> took the Land <hi>only</hi> of his Landlord, <hi>not the
Profits.</hi> He knew well enough what Land he took,
but he knew not, when he took the Land, what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
he should have. The Profits he receives <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
by the Blessing of God on his Labour and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Endeavours, with the use and imployment of his
Stock, <hi>which his Landlord hath nothing to do with.</hi>
               <pb n="496" facs="tcp:65611:256"/>
So that if the Priest will needs claim the tenth part
of the <hi>Quaker's Profits,</hi> because the <hi>Quaker</hi> did not
take <hi>it</hi> of his Landlord, he may by the same Reason
claim the <hi>other nine</hi> parts of the <hi>profits</hi> too, because
the <hi>Quaker</hi> did not take them of his Landlord nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, he says,</hi> They only ask that which was or
ought to have been abated in his Rent.</p>
            <p>I deny that. That which they demand, (viz. the
tenth part of the Profits) neither was nor ought to
have been abated in the Rent. If it shou'd be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
that any thing is abated, yet the most that could
be expected would be but the tenth part of the Rent.
And if the tenth part of the Profits be no more than
the tenth part of the Rent, then must the whole
Profit be no more than the whole Rent; and what
then shall the Farmer have to defray his Charge, and
maintain his Family? But if the tenth part of the
Profit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, which the Priest claims, be more than the
tenth part of the Rent, then (according to the
Priest's own way of reasoning) he demands more of
the <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ker</hi> than either is or ought to be abated. And
indeed, what Reason has a Landlord to abate of his
Rent in consideration of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ythes, which are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
out of the Land, which be lets, but out of
the Profits only, which the Tenant by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>is own La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
Stock and Industry (through the Blessing of
God) acquires? However, how could the tenth
part of the Profits <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e abated in the Rent, whenas the
Rent is certain and fixed for twenty years or more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and the Profits alwayes uncertain, never it

you,</hi> and <hi>bought your Ware,</hi> and paid <hi>full dearly</hi> for
your Sermons; but <hi>they'l never trade with you more:</hi>
for they see <hi>your Ware is nought,</hi> and they find you
the <hi>worst sort</hi> of Chapmen of any they have to do
with. For (as I formerly observed) take the most
greedy and over-reaching Tradesman that one can

and that he has such as will fit my turn, yet he will

and if I do <hi>not take it,</hi> to be sure he will <hi>never demand
any thing of me for it.</hi> But this Priest will either
make us take his Ware, though we neither like it,
nor have any need of it; or to be sure will make
us pay for it, though we never take it. What can
be <hi>more Vnreasonable,</hi> what <hi>more Dishonest</hi> than
this!</p>
            <p>§. 28. As for going to Law for Tythes, you have
<hi>(says he to his Brother Priest, §. 51.)</hi> fully proved
it lawful in the <hi>Conference,</hi> and the <hi>Quaker</hi> answers
not one of your Arguments; so that till he reply to
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:65611:257"/>
that, I will only note, That it is much against our W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>I answered all his Arguments for going to Law
for Tythes, in proving at large that <hi>Tythes are not due;</hi>
for <hi>no Argument can justifie going to law for that which
is not due;</hi> and if Tythes were due from the <hi>Quaker</hi> to
the Priest, he should not need to go to Law for them;
the <hi>Quaker</hi> would be as ready to pay them, as the
Priest should be to receive them. I also shewed (in
my former Answer, pag. 361, 362.) That <q>for a
Minister of Christ to sue men at Law for his Belley,
is without all Precept, President, or Ground in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</q>
Religion or Reason; and that <q>it is contrary to
the nature of a Gospel-Maintenance, which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
free and voluntary,</q> not at all compu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sory.
But this the Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sts, both one and t'other, chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to let pass <hi>untouch't,</hi> than give occasion for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inquiry into it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the other Priest (in his</hi> Vindication <hi>of the</hi>
Conference, <hi>pag. 327.) though he silently slips over
what I said against Priest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> going to Law for Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
yet to blemish (if he could) the</hi> Quakers,
<hi>he says,</hi> Whereas the <hi>Quakers</hi> (to make Magistrates
as useless as Ministers) used to declaim against going to
Law upon any occasion whatsoever, <hi>T. E.</hi> in contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to his Brethren; says, In Civil Cases it is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
for a man to recover his due by Law. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Priest asks,</hi> Have the <hi>Quakers</hi> received some
n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w Dispensation from Heaven? If not, how comes it to be
lawful to go to Law now in Civil Cases, when 20 years
ago the same thing was denyed by them as unlawful?</p>
            <p>Had he intended to have convicted me of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
my Brethren, it had behoved him to have
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:65611:257"/>
proved (not only said) that the <hi>Quakers</hi> did use to
declame against going to Law <hi>upon any occasion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</hi>
Not only <hi>Honesty</hi> would have obliged him so
to do, but <hi>common Prudence</hi> would have led him to
it. But seeing he has so confidently said it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
offering any Proof, <hi>I put him upon the Proof of it,</hi>
and leave him under the Imputation of <hi>Slander,</hi> until
he shall give a Proof of his Assertion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon this</hi> false Insin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation <hi>he thus proceeds,</hi> The
Spirit then by which the <hi>Quakers</hi> pretend to be inspired,
either differs from it self, or is not the same Spirit which
the <hi>Quakers</hi> so lately pretended to.</p>
            <p>The Spirit by which the <hi>Quakers</hi> are inspired, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
differs from it self, nor is any other Spirit than
that, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> have alwayes not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to, but injoyed. The <hi>Quakers</hi> are led by the
same Spirit that ever they were, and their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
is the same that ever it was. And truly I do not
see but the Priests also are led by the same Spirit, by
which they were led twenty years ago: for <hi>they
B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lyed the</hi> Quakers <hi>twenty years ago, and so they do still.</hi>
Of this <hi>black Art</hi> this Priest is <hi>Master,</hi> and as one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
by <hi>false Reports</hi> to defame (if he could) them,
whom by Fair Reasoning and Plain Arguments he is
not able to withstand, he tells his Stories of the
<hi>Quakers</hi> with as great Confidence as if he himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
them.</p>
            <p>One of them <hi>(says he, Vindication, pag. 328.)</hi>
told me very lately, That I accused the <hi>Quakers</hi> falsly
in saying that they neglect to crave a Blessing upon their
Meat, which is now frequently practised among them:
<hi>Whereupon he says,</hi> If this be their Minds now, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
they talked at another rate: What <hi>(said they)</hi>
we crave a Blessing when we go to Meat? that's stinting
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:65611:258"/>
the Spirit to a Meal, to a Breakfast, a Dinner, or a
Supper.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> Practice in this case <hi>now</hi> is no other
than it <hi>alwayes was.</hi> They <hi>never</hi> neglected to crave a
Blessing upon their Meat, but have <hi>alwayes</hi> used to
wait upon the Lord, <hi>in an holy Fear and Reverence,</hi>
both to crave and receive his Blessing. So that the
Priest is indeed a False Accuser of the <hi>Quakers</hi> in
saying, <hi>They formerly talked at another Rate.</hi> Let
him name those <hi>Quakers</hi> (if he can) that have said,
(as he reports the words) <hi>What we crave a Blessing
when we go to Meat?</hi> And to provoke him to it, let
him take notice, that the <hi>Charge of Slander is left at
his Door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> He blames the <hi>Quakers</hi> for making their
Appeals to Sessions and Assizes, bringing A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tions, &amp;c.
though they know there can be no pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eding in any Court
but that both Witnesses and Iuries must give their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences
and Verdicts upon Oath. If then it be truly
so <hi>(says he)</hi> why will they be any Occasion to bring a
Disgrace and Reproach upon <hi>Christianity? Vind. p. 32<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Christianity</hi> is disgraced and reproached by
<hi>Oathes</hi> is too true, but that the Occasion thereof is
brought by the <hi>Quakers</hi> is as false. The <hi>Quakers</hi> do
not desire that either Witnesses or Juries should give
their Evidences or Verdicts <hi>upon Oath;</hi> but that both
the one and the other should speak the plain and naked
Truth <hi>without an Oath,</hi> and that under the <hi>same Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
as by <hi>Oath,</hi> to which the <hi>Quakers</hi> with all readiness
of Mind subject themselves, if they be found guilty of
giving False Evidence. It is not then the <hi>Quakers</hi>
fault that <hi>Christianity</hi> is dishonoured by Oaths, but
it is the <hi>Priest's Envy</hi> that casts this false Aspersion on
them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="501" facs="tcp:65611:258"/>
But he charges the <hi>Quakers</hi> not only with occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
others to Swear, but with taking Oaths them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
too, and he says <hi>he is able to make it out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He should have done it then; and I make no doubt
but he would, if he had any ground for what he
saith: for it cannot be supposed, that he who hath
so <hi>grosly abused</hi> the <hi>Quakers without all ground,</hi> would
have <hi>spared</hi> them an inch in any thing for which he
had had a real ground.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He adds a couple of Stories which he pretends to
have heard from others. The one is of</hi> two <hi>Quakers</hi>
that took their Oaths in answer to an Exchequer Bill,
and very formally too, put off their Hats, and kiss'd
the Book: <hi>and this he says, was</hi> lately told him by an
Attorney of great Account and Practice. <hi>His other
Tale is of</hi> a <hi>Quaker</hi> who at a Commission, came very
formally to Swear against the late Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi>
in a Chancery Suit. <hi>And that</hi> being asked by one of the
Commissioners (from whom, <hi>he says,</hi> he had the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count)
How it came to pass that he being a <hi>Quaker</hi>
would Swear? he told him, Thou knowest that among
Hunts-men it was never thought amiss to kill a Fox or
Badger by any means; such being allowed no fair play,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> leaving it to himself to make the application.</p>
            <p>These are matters of <hi>fact,</hi> depending upon <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Evidences,</hi> which the Priest ought to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
if he had intended to have dealt <hi>honestly.</hi> Had
he named the <hi>Quakers</hi> whom he here accuses, or
those Persons from whom he pretends to have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
his Information, I would have taken the pains to
have sifted his Reports, and tryed the Truth of his
Stories: and that I suppose he fore-saw, and <hi>feared.</hi>
But seeing he hath chosen so <hi>dark</hi> a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath to walk in,
to secure himself from being <hi>traced,</hi> I think it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:65611:259"/>
at present to tell him, first, That if any who bear
the Name of <hi>Quakers</hi> have done as he reports of
them, they have therein done <hi>very wickedly and evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and deserve as great <hi>condemnation and shame,</hi> as
he himself does for thus <hi>belying them,</hi> if they have
not so done. But secondly, for my own part, I do
not believe his Stories to be true, but that they are
either <hi>forged by himself,</hi> or taken <hi>upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
of his own temper, and thus cast abroad with
an <hi>evil design to defame the</hi> Quakers, and blast the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
God has given them. As therefore I <hi>fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provoke</hi> my Adversary to give over <hi>Creeping,</hi> and
<hi>stand up like a man,</hi> and to bring forth his <hi>Proofs</hi>
and make good his <hi>Charges</hi> against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> if he
be able: So I also make this just Request to my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that he will not pre-judge us for such <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi>
Reports, raised or spread abroad by our <hi>profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
and <hi>avowed</hi> Enemies, but will suspend his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>till he sees a Proof.</hi> If I had a mind to retaliate
my Adversary, I could do it very effectually, and
give him a large Catalogue of <hi>scandalous</hi> and <hi>infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is not to be wondred that he should defend his

            <p>The Author of the <hi>Right of Tythes</hi> spends the

in all that I see no Argument (unless it be of a <hi>bad

                  </gap>ause</hi> and <hi>Mind)</hi> therefore I let it pass. But he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
that the former Priest had said, <hi>The Primitive</hi>

            <p>But let him know, The Objection is over-worn
with being <hi>often</hi> replied to already; <hi>It is worn with

               </gap>at is so

that his Brother Priest urged this Objection
with reference to <hi>a future debate, as Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

never begin it till <hi>Providence</hi> assists him, I never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect

What unhappy Conjunction was it then of <hi>Mirth</hi> and
somewhat else that produced this <hi>rare Effect</hi> in him,
to make the <hi>most politick Equivocation and Sophistry
the Effects of Ignorance and Folly.</hi> But leaving him to

               </hi> I will wipe off an <hi>Aspersion</hi> which
the other Priest hath cast upon the <hi>Quakers;</hi> which,
having no relation to the Case of Tythes, I thought
fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to refer to this place, that I might not by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weaving
it (as he has done) with the subject of Tythes,
interrupt the Course of the preceding Discourse:
and the rather, because, though he brings in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
towards the beginning of his Chapter of Tythes,
pag. 300, he repeats it in the Conclusion of his Book,
pag. 333. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e matter is this.</p>
            <p>The Author of the <hi>Conference,</hi> amongst his many
Abuses, charged the <hi>Quakers</hi> with mis-applying that
Text, <hi>Ier. 5. 31. The Priests bear Rule by their
Means.</hi> And because I took no notice of it in my
former Answer, he (in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> pag. 300.
301.) begins to <hi>insult</hi> and <hi>boast,</hi> as if I had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
passed it by, because <hi>I knew neither how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
his Argument, nor vindicate the Reputation of
my own Party;</hi> and that, <hi>not knowing how to excuse
this, I had put it into the Catalogue of minute passages.
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:65611:261"/>
Minute</hi> enough it certainly is to be put into such a
Catalogue. But to let him see he glories in a <hi>false</hi>
Reason, I will give him the true Reasons why I did
not think it deserved an Answer. First, because he
brought it in with an <hi>idle Story</hi> (as himself calls it,
pag<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 153.) o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Invention of Guns and Powder,
no way pertinent to the subject he was upon, but a
very silly digression from the matter, which I have
observed frequent in him, and take for an Indication
of a discomposed Brain. Secondly, because though
he charged the <hi>Quakers</hi> with mis-applying that Text,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 5. 31. yet he neither named any <hi>Quaker</hi> by
whom, nor any Book in which that Text was any
way app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ied, or so much as at all mentioned: So
that his Charge had neither Top nor Bottom, Head
nor Tayl. Who then could have thought the man
so idle to expect an Answer to such an idle Charge!
But now (in his <hi>Vindication,</hi> pag. 301.) he quotes,
after an odd manner, a <hi>Tract</hi> (so he stiles it) <hi>called,
Some of the</hi> Quakers <hi>Principles, put forth</hi> (he says)
<hi>by</hi> Isaac Penington, <hi>and the second</hi> Quaker <hi>there</hi> (he
tells us) <hi>has this passage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I can tell him there is no such Tract put forth
by <hi>Isaac Penington;</hi> although a Book there is bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Title, <hi>Some Principles of the Elect People of
God in scorn called</hi> Quakers (which is a Collection of
some particular passages, relating to our Principles,
taken out of several Books of divers Men, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
together) But neither was this put forth by
<hi>Isaac Penington,</hi> although his Name be to some parts
of it. This I take to be the Book which the Priest
refers to: And though he cites no page thereof, yet
finding in the fifth page that Passage (I suppose) which
he cavils at, I will set it down at large as it there
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:65611:261"/>
stands. The Title of that Page is this, <hi>Grounds and
Reasons why we deny the World's Teachers;</hi> And the
third Reason is thus given, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>They are such
Priests as bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

horrible and filthy t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing committed in the Land,
which the Lord sent <hi>Ieremiah</hi> to cry out against;
while we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ad Eye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and did not see, we held up
such Priests, but the Lord hath opened our Eyes,
and we see them now in the same Estate that they
were in, which <hi>Ieremiah</hi> cryed out against, who
did not bear rule by his means; and therefore we
deny them,</q> 
               <hi>Ier.</hi> 5. 31. This is that Paragraph to
a Syllable; in which there is <hi>no Foundation</hi> for the
Priest's <hi>Cavil:</hi> for the <hi>Quaker</hi> doth not say (as
the Priest suggests) that those Priests, mentioned by
<hi>Ieremiah,</hi> did bear Rule by their Estates; but that
<hi>these</hi> Priests, whom we deny, are such as bear Rule
by their Means or Estates. Those Priests, in the
time of the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> did bear Rule by
means of the false Prophets: These Priests now adays
do bear Rule by means or help of those Estates which
they get from the People. <hi>That</hi> was an horrible
and filthy thing <hi>then: This</hi> is an horrible and filthy
thing <hi>now.</hi> For the horribleness and filthiness of the
thing must not be restrained to their bearing Rule by
those <hi>particular</hi> means only, and no other: for if
they had born Rule by any other <hi>false</hi> and <hi>indirect</hi>
means, it would have been an horrible and filthy
thing, as well as it was in their bearing rule by means
of the false Prophets. For the <hi>only</hi> means by which
the Priests of God ought to bear Rule is the Spirit
and Power of God, the vertue and influence of the
divine Truth; and those Priests that take upon them
to bear Rule by <hi>any other</hi> means than this, commit an
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:65611:262"/>
horrible and filthy thing. Thus did those Priests in
<hi>Ieremiah's</hi> time; They bore Rule, <hi>not</hi> by means of
the divine Spirit and Power, <hi>not</hi> by means of the
Heavenly vertue and influence of T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uth, but by <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
means, <hi>viz.</hi> by means of the false P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ophets, and
therefore the true Prophet cryed out against them.
And thus do Priests now adayes; They bear Rule,
<hi>not</hi> by means of the Spirit and Power of God; <hi>not</hi>
by means of the divine vertue and influence of Truth,
but by <hi>other</hi> means, <hi>viz.</hi> by means of those <hi>Estates</hi>
which they get from the People, and therefore do
we, in the Name of the Lord, deny them. Now it
is manifest, that the Author of that Book, out of
which this passage is taken, did not say that those
Priests of <hi>old</hi> and these of <hi>late</hi> did both bear Rule by
<hi>one and the same</hi> means; but the scope and dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t of
his words there is to shew, that they did both bear
Rule by <hi>false</hi> and <hi>unlawful</hi> means: for he says (in
the place fore-quoted) <q>While we had Eyes and
did not see, we held up such Priests, but the Lord
hath opened our Eyes, and we see them now in
the same Estate that they were in, which <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi>
cryed out against, who did not bear Rule by
his means.</q> So that <hi>herein</hi> it is that he shews <hi>they
agree;</hi> in <hi>this</hi> it is that he draws the Comparison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, <hi>viz.</hi> in that <hi>they did not bear Rule by
God's means.</hi> In this they were both in the <hi>same
Estate,</hi> namely, in that they did both bear Rule by
<hi>wrong</hi> means, although they did not both bear Rule
by <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> wrong means. The <hi>Identity</hi> or
<hi>Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eness</hi> is not refer'd to the <hi>particular means</hi> by
which they did and do bear Rule, but to the <hi>Estate</hi>
which they were and are in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who did and do bear
Rule by <hi>indirect</hi> mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. Therefore, observe, He
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:65611:262"/>
doth not say, We see them now bear Rule by the
<hi>same means</hi> that they bore Rule by which <hi>Ieremiah</hi>
cryed out against: but he says, <q>We see them now
in the <hi>same Estate</hi> that they were in which <hi>Ieremiah</hi>
cryed against, who did not bear Rule by <hi>his</hi> (viz.
God's) means;</q> which was an <hi>estate</hi> of <hi>Apostacy</hi>
and <hi>Degeneration,</hi> an <hi>estate</hi> of <hi>Alienation</hi> from God,
and of <hi>Rebellion</hi> against him, <hi>usurping</hi> to themselves
an <hi>Authority,</hi> and bearing <hi>Rule</hi> over the People, but
<hi>not by God's means,</hi> not by those means which God
had appointed, <hi>viz.</hi> by the divine Vertue and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Power of his holy Spirit, but having recourse
to <hi>other</hi> means to get up, and to keep up a <hi>Dominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
and Rule. Now although the means, by which
those Priests then did, and these now do bear Rule,
are not <hi>Specifically</hi> the very <hi>same;</hi> yet are they <hi>one</hi>
and the <hi>same</hi> in Nature, that is, they are both <hi>wrong
means,</hi> both <hi>unlawful means,</hi> both such means as God
neither appointed nor allowed, which is the ground
of their being disclaimed, and declamed against both
by the Prophet of Old, and by us now. So that
they are the <hi>same,</hi> in that respect, in and for which
they were and are disowned: and in <hi>that</hi> part it is
that the Comparison lies; with respect to <hi>that</hi> part
the Parallel is drawn. Nor doth the <hi>Allusion</hi> to the
Prophet's words strictly tye the <hi>Alluder</hi> to an <hi>exact</hi>
Comparison in <hi>every</hi> point and circumstance; but <hi>it
is sufficient, that the Comparison holds in that part,
upon which the Argument is grounded.</hi> Now the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's</hi>
Argument here against the Priests is grounded
on their bearing Rule by <hi>false</hi> and <hi>indirect</hi> means, by
such means as are <hi>not God's means:</hi> and these Priests
being compared (in <hi>this</hi> respect) with those Priests
in <hi>Ieremiah's</hi> time, the Comparison is found to be
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:65611:263"/>
               <hi>true</hi> and <hi>good;</hi> for those Priests, then did bear Rule
by means <hi>alike unlawful.</hi> And the Prophet's crying
out against <hi>those</hi> Priests <hi>then</hi> for committing thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>'s judgment, let
me now take the liberty to Expostulate a little with
the Priest, and ask him why he did not Answer those
Grounds and Reasons, which (in the Book before-quoted,

me? Has he not here <hi>catched</hi> at and <hi>plaid</hi> upon a

Again, his Brother Priest says, in another Case
(though without Cause, as I have already shewed)
<hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>may be ashamed to let the Objection grow
old and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lain against the Priests! (it is little less than
twenty years since they were first printed) Might
not they well be ashamed (if they were not past
shame) who, in all this time, have neither confessed
the Truth, nor made any Satisfactory Reply to the
Objections? This Priest could find in his heart to
look among the Grounds and Reasons there given,
to see if he could find any thing to carp at; but let
whoso will answer them, for him. He had not it
seems <hi>Ingenuity</hi> enough to <hi>confess</hi> the Truth; nor
<hi>Courage</hi> enough to undertake a <hi>Reply</hi> to the Reasons.
Nay, he did not so much as attempt to <hi>answer</hi> that

That they are such Priests as bear Rule by their
Means.</hi> That they are indeed such, is too notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to be denyed: and according as their Means are

that seek for their Gain from their Quarters, and
