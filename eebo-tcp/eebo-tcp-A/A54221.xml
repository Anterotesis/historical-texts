         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Some Sober and Weighty Reaſons againſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
Proteſtant Diſſenters, for Difference of Opinion in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion. Humbly offered to the Conſideration of all
in Authority.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Reaſ.</hi> BEcauſe the great and mighty God, who is King of Kings and Lord of
Lords, hath not impoſed matters of Religion upon the Conſciences
of Men and Women by any outward force: God hath not appointed
Death, nor Banniſhment, nor Impriſonment, nor loſs of goods,
as a means to bring perſons to conform to the way of his Worſhip; but God hath
given his Word, and favoured the World with ſuch as can Preach it, whoſe work is
to invite, intreat, perſwade; and not in a lordly way to domineer over the Conſciences
of Men and Women, whether they be Rich or Poor.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Becauſe all ſorts of mankind are fallable in ſome Divine matters, even
in all Countreys; the Princes, the Prieſts, and the People, are yet ſhort of infalla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>billity
in many matters of Divinity; yea the moſt Eminent Miniſters of the Goſpel
in the Primitive time confeſſed they <hi>ſaw but in part, and they knew but in part;</hi> and
ſaid to their fellow Chriſtians, that they would not <hi>lord</hi> or <hi>domineer over them,</hi> but be
<hi>helpers of their Joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Becauſe all ſorts of perſons do deſire this as a great good for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
even thoſe that are for diſtreſſing of, and impoſing upon others, would not
be ſo dealt with themſelves, but would Account it hard meaſure, yea cruelty, to
be forced to ſuch things in Religion as are againſt their Conſciences, or elſe to ſuffer
in their Purſe or Perſons. As for inſtance, the <hi>Epiſcopal Proteſtant</hi> would doom it
great Perſecution to be puniſhed if he would not turn <hi>Presbyterian, Independant,
Baptist,</hi> or <hi>Quaker;</hi> and why then ſhould the <hi>Epiſcopal Proteſtant</hi> take pleaſure in
puniſhing of, and ſo force any of the others to be of his mind? And therefore
great and good Reaſon it is to walk by that Bleſſed Rule Chriſt hath given, <hi>Do unto
others as you would they ſhould do unto you, and what you would not others ſhould do unto
you, do not to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Becauſe forcing the Conſcience is the Ready way to make men Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites;
for if perſons conform to any way of Worſhip unwillingly, they cannot
ſerve God acceptably, though the matter and form of worſhip be never ſo Right,
becauſe the heart of the Worſhippers is not Right, the Service being performed by
by Mans Compulſion; God requireth that his Service ſhould be performed with <hi>a
perfect heart, and with a willing mind;</hi> but he that conforms by Compulſion, in ſtead
of being Gods Servant, he is but Mans ſlave: and the Conformity is to Man, and
not to God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Becauſe His Majeſty did Sollemnly promiſe Liberty of Conſcience in
matters of Religion, when he was at <hi>Breda,</hi> Juſt upon his Reſtauration to his Throne
and Kingdoms, in <hi>April</hi> 1660. In theſe words: <hi>We do declare a Liberty to
Tender Conſciences and that no man ſhall be diſquieted, or called
in Queſtion for differences of opinion in matters of Religion, which
doe not diſturb the Peace of the kingdom; &amp; that we ſhall be Ready to
Conſent to ſuch an Act of Parliament as upon mature deliberation
ſhall be offered to us, for the full granting that Indulgence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Becauſe the proſecuting the <hi>Proteſtant Deſſenters</hi> for matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
is a great diſquieting of the minds of great numbers of his Majeſties good
Subjects, and a great hinderance to the Trade of the Kingdom, the Diſſenters being
a great part of the Trading People of this Kingdom; and ſome thing of this his
Majeſty was gratiouſly pleaſed to take into his Princely Conſideration, when he put
forth his indulging Declaration, by the advice of his Privy Councel, in <hi>March,</hi> 1672.
after a violent proſecution of that Act againſt Conventicles, in theſe very words:
<hi>But it being Evident by the ſad Experience of Twelve Years, that there
is very little fruit of all thoſe. FORCEABLE courſes: we think
our ſelf obliged to make uſe of that Supream Power in Eccleſiaſtical
matters, which is not only inherent in us but hath been declared and
recognized to be ſo by ſeveral Statutes and Acts of Parliament; and
therefore we do now accordingly Iſſue this our Declaration, as well
for the quieting of the minds of our good Subjects in theſe points,
for inviting of Strangers in this conjuncture to come and liue under
us, and for the better incouragement of all to a cheerful following of
<pb facs="tcp:103045:2"/>
their Trade and Callings, from whence we hope by the bleſſing of God
to have many good and happy advantages to our Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Becauſe the Lords and Commons Aſſembled in Parliament, ſence thoſe
Declarations have upon MATURE DELIBERATION conſidered the ill conſequences
of proſecuting the Proteſtant Diſſenters by the penal Laws, and have ſhewed their
willingneſs to a Toleration, and prohibiting of a proſecution of Proteſtants for
matters of Conſcience.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Becauſe the <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants, who are the Diſſenters from the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
Worſhip of that Kingdom, are gratiouſly Received by the King, and kindly
Received and ſuccoured by the People of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King is highly
blamed for Perſecuting his peaceable Subjects; and therefore much more Reaſon
that Proteſtants ſhould not perſecute one another, for it is to do the ſame things that
is condemned in others: therefore let the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> be well conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Thou art inexcuſable, O man, whoever thou art, that Judgeſt another,
thou condemneſt thy ſelf, for thou that Judgeſt doeſt the ſame things thy ſelf;</hi> Verſe 3.
<hi>And thinkeſt thou, O man, that Judgeſt them which do ſuch things, and doeſt the ſame, that
thou ſhalt eſcape the Judgment of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> There is a good and great Agreement between the Conforming, and
Non-conforming Proteſtants, in the Chief things of the Proteſtant Religion: as for
Inſtance; 1. Both parties believe in the holy Trinity, <hi>viz.</hi> The Father, Son, and holy
Ghoſt: 2. That Jeſus Chriſt is very God and very Man, and the only Saviour of Sinners:
3. That Salvation doth depend upon the miraculous Birth, the holy Life, the painful
Death, the wonderful Reſurection, the Joyful Aſcention, the conſtant Interceſſion,
and the ſecond coming of Jeſus Chriſt: 4. Both parties believe that the Worſhip of
God, and the Converſations of men, ought to be according to the holy Scriptures,
and not according to the inventions of any ſort of mankind: 5. Both parties do deny
all Mediators but only Jeſus Chriſt, and abhor praying to deceaſed Saints: 6. Both
parties deny a Purgatory, and do believe and profeſs a Heaven of Eternal Joy for
the godly, and a Hell of Eternal woe for the wicked. All theſe things more largely
and plainly are made manifeſt in Confeſſions of Faith, Printed by the Diſſenting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
as well as by the Conforming Proteſtants. Now the matters wherein they
differ from each other being ſmaller then the former things, and yet ſuch as each part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
cannot conform unto without wronging their Conſcience, and ſo ſinning againſt
God, therefore they ought not to be Forced.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Becauſe Perſecution for matters of Conſcience is a Breach of the good
Rules of Humanity, and common Civility among all ſorts of men, which is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
obſerved in ſmaller matters: as for inſtance, among the many Creatures of God
that are Food for mens Bodies, ſome things that are very pleaſing and comfortable
Food for ſome men, the ſame things are very Deſtructive to the health of other men;
now in this Caſe there is ſuch Civility among all ſorts of men that they hate and
ſcorn to force one anothers Stomacks, looking upon it to be an inhumane practiſe; and
therefore do friendly, ſay to each other, <hi>Pray eat that which will beſt go down, and
agree with your Stomack.</hi> Now for as much as Conſcience is greater then Stomack,
and the hurt of the Soul greater then the hurt of the Body, how much more ſhould
perſons, eſpecially Proteſtants, be thus friendly one to another in matters of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience?</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Becauſe all Proteſtants ought to behave themſelves towards each other
as Brethren, there being ſo good and great agreement between them in the chief things
of Religion; Eſpecially they being all in a like danger of the Bloody <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who if
ever the Government ſhould fall into their Bloody hands, (which God of his mercy
prevent) then the ſame miſeries that may befal the Proteſtant Diſſenters, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
befal the Conforming Proteſtants; if they prove true to their Proteſtant
Principles, they will all be deemed Hereticks, and muſt ſuffer as much in their Eſtates
and Perſons; and therefore inſtead of Perſecuting one another, they ſhould love each
other, and pray for each other, and ſay as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to <hi>Lot, Let there be no ſtrife
between me and thee, for we are Brethren:</hi> and more eſpecially becauſe the <hi>Popiſh Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonite</hi>
and <hi>Perrizite</hi> are now too much in the Land.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>Reaſon,</hi> Becauſe the Proteſtant Diſſenters do not belong to any Forraign Power,
but do abhor, deteſt, and proteſt againſt all Forreign Power or Juriſdiction over the
King, the Kingdom, or any of his Majeſties Subjects; neither are they covetous of
Preferment in Church or State, but willingly leave that to his Majeſties wiſdom, and
deſire only that they may live a peaceable Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty under
Authority, as Gods Word doth direct.</p>
