         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>where to begin,</hi> than <hi>what to say.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dearest Madam, this little
Book will inform You what <hi>You</hi>
can <hi>do,</hi> and I have <hi>suffered:</hi> my
<hi>torments</hi> (the <hi>Characters</hi> of Your
powerful <hi>Beauty</hi>) are here exactly
<hi>delineated,</hi> that You may <hi>read</hi> and
<hi>pity</hi> me, now almost become
<hi>Loves emphatical Martyr.</hi> It will
seem a <hi>wonder</hi> scarce capable of
his <hi>belief,</hi> should I tell the <hi>Reader,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:35344:5"/>
The described <hi>Passions</hi> in this <hi>Book,</hi>
come short of what I have, and
the <hi>Torments</hi> of what I endure for
You. In some places You will
see <hi>Your self</hi> deservedly seated on
a <hi>Throne,</hi> which can dart <hi>astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
influences</hi> and a <hi>dreadful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
distributing <hi>desirable afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
and <hi>pleasing deaths,</hi> which the
most <hi>greedy of life</hi> would <hi>desire,</hi>
and joyfully <hi>embrace:</hi> In other
places You may <hi>visit</hi> Your easie-gotten
<hi>Conquests,</hi> and see the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<hi>Trophies</hi> of Your <hi>Beauty.</hi>
Others You have slightly <hi>touched,</hi>
and but with a few <hi>Darts,</hi> Me
You have transfixt with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand:
their wounds do not <hi>need,</hi>
mine are <hi>scarce capable</hi> of <hi>cure;</hi> and
their greatest <hi>Emphasis</hi> is their
<pb facs="tcp:35344:6"/>
               <hi>not being mortal.</hi> Yet We valiant
<hi>Lovers</hi> like these <hi>pleasing Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
love the <hi>hand</hi> that <hi>strikes</hi> us,
play with the <hi>flames</hi> that <hi>scorch</hi>
us, and enjoy them the <hi>blessed
Authors</hi> of our <hi>deaths.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But lest, whilst I talk of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,</hi>
my trespassing too long
upon Your <hi>patience,</hi> may justifie
Your <hi>inflicting</hi> them, and so turn
them into <hi>Punishments;</hi> and lest
the <hi>Prologue</hi> drown the <hi>Play,</hi> and
forestal the <hi>patience</hi> of the <hi>hearers,</hi>
which would be more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously
reserv'd for the ensuing
<hi>Acts;</hi> I retire, onely begging
leave to advertise You, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
some Expressions in this Book
are <hi>harsh</hi> and <hi>uncouth,</hi> that may
not be charged upon the <hi>Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:35344:6"/>
who hath in favour of Your
<hi>fair Sex</hi> trespassed more than once
upon the <hi>Author,</hi> and fears he
shall stand in need of the learned
<hi>Reader</hi>'s pardon for making so
many, as he begs <hi>Yours</hi> for not
making more <hi>alterations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dearest <hi>Madam,</hi> read this <hi>little
Book,</hi> and see the <hi>reflex image</hi>
both of <hi>Your self</hi> and <hi>Me:</hi> there
You will finde what You <hi>already
are,</hi> and what all other Ladies
from Your example <hi>fain would be;</hi>
who onely blame You for setting
Your Example so <hi>high,</hi> that it
<hi>deceives</hi> their <hi>sight, baffles</hi> their
<hi>hopes,</hi> and <hi>discourages</hi> their <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours</hi>
of <hi>imitation.</hi> In mercy to
the <hi>gazing world,</hi> bridle this <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury</hi>

               <hi>Goodness:</hi> 'tis <hi>thrifty</hi> counsel, and
conduces to <hi>Your happiness</hi> and
<hi>Ours</hi> too: it gives us <hi>hopes,</hi> that
though we can't attain Your <hi>course,</hi>
we seeing our <hi>Guide,</hi> may go part
of that <hi>Religious way:</hi> for though
by a <hi>higher pitch</hi> of <hi>Vertue</hi> (if
that <hi>supposition</hi> be no <hi>Crime</hi>) You
might be transcribed into some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<hi>above humanity;</hi> yet wrapt
in <hi>Clouds,</hi> we had lost our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
You our love; and You
leaving us in danger of <hi>seduction</hi>
into <hi>Idolatry,</hi> lest you should be
without <hi>fault,</hi> are become guilty
<hi>of ours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But methinks I begin to forget
my <hi>Crime,</hi> which I promised to <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which cannot be better done, than by not <hi>anticipating</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:35344:7"/>
Your reading of this <hi>Book,</hi> which
when read, will supersede the
trouble of <hi>subscription.</hi> Whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is there of <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Adoration,</hi>
I shall do <hi>You</hi> that <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>my

and payment: which <hi>tribute</hi>

            <head>TO THE

            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Here present thee with a Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the deservedly admired
<hi>Effigies Amoris;</hi> but with such
Variations from the Latin, as will
make me obnoxious to thy Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
To give you the particular reasons,
were a direct thwarting of my interest,
and undoing all I have already done in
prosecution of my end: yet I dare tell
you my reasons are such as will either se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
me <hi>from,</hi> or enable me willingly to
<hi>bear</hi> the worst that <hi>Zoilus</hi> can do; I
shall be as capable of his <hi>Envy,</hi> as he will
be deserving of my <hi>Scorn,</hi> and needful
of my <hi>Pity:</hi> but because it is so easie to
<hi>pretend</hi> any <hi>reasons</hi> when a man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand
<pb facs="tcp:35344:9"/>
resolv'd not to <hi>discover</hi> them,
I think fit to acquaint you, that there
are in the <hi>Latine</hi> so many <hi>harsh</hi> and
<hi>jarring</hi> expressions, so derogatory to the
<hi>honour</hi> and the <hi>dominion</hi> that the <hi>fair
Sex</hi> (for whose sake I <hi>avow</hi> the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of this <hi>Translation</hi>) have by
their <hi>victorious Beauty</hi> acquired in the
<hi>world,</hi> that I thought my self <hi>oblig'd</hi>
(having <hi>listed my self</hi> under <hi>Cupid</hi>'s
<hi>Banner</hi>) to espouse their <hi>Cause,</hi> and
thereby become at once an <hi>Orator</hi> for
<hi>them</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Waring</hi> the ingenious <hi>Author</hi> of
this <hi>Book,</hi> might be allowed some <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otick
transports,</hi> and ought to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
the <hi>roving Excursions</hi> of a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
fancy and unlimited invention:
he was <hi>full,</hi> and those expressions must
be lookt upon as the <hi>frothy overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>
of a <hi>luxuriant brain:</hi> though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, if taken <hi>entirely,</hi> he is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one of the most <hi>ingenious Authors</hi>
that ever this <hi>fruitful age</hi> hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced;
whose excellent <hi>Character</hi> (set
<pb facs="tcp:35344:9"/>
down by Mr. <hi>Griffith,</hi> (the Publisher of
the <hi>last Edition</hi>) will easily <hi>excuse</hi> me
from speaking farther of a person whom
I no otherwise <hi>knew</hi> but by <hi>Fame;</hi>
and this <hi>little,</hi> but <hi>best</hi> Monument of
himself: which renders my attempt of
<hi>translation</hi> as bold and as dangerous as
<hi>Horace</hi> pronounc'd his <hi>Endeavours</hi> to
be, who durst emulate <hi>Pindar.</hi> But
<hi>Love</hi> commanded, and I had nothing
else to do but to obey: I told him I was
<hi>not eloquent;</hi> he replied that he could
<hi>make me so:</hi> he commanded me to
<hi>speak,</hi> and taught me <hi>how;</hi> and whilst
he <hi>unseal'd</hi> my lips, <hi>influenced</hi> my
tongue. <hi>Cupid</hi> is the <hi>Muses</hi> and the
<hi>Worlds Hannibal,</hi> whose prosperous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures
serve to teach us, that to <hi>him,</hi>
and <hi>us</hi> under his <hi>Conduct,</hi> nothing is
inaccessible, nothing is invincible: and
let him that <hi>laughs</hi> at <hi>me</hi> and my <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,</hi>
beware lest by the influence
I have upon my <hi>Master,</hi> he be not in a
condition of <hi>shaking hands,</hi> and prove
as emphatical a <hi>fool</hi> as he thinks I am.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:35344:10"/>Thus, <hi>Reader,</hi> I have acquainted you
with some of my <hi>reasons,</hi> and told you
likewise that I have more in my Bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get,
which being purposely kept there
for secresie's sake, you are by the laws of
<hi>Modesty</hi> forbidden to make any farther
<hi>enquiry</hi> after them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Epitaph</hi> upon <hi>Ben. Johnson</hi> I
was unwilling to leave out, though I am
sensible it hath <hi>lost</hi> much by the <hi>transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
It was in the Latine (as I have
made it in the English) rather a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numental
inscription</hi> than a <hi>Poem.</hi> So
that in this <hi>Verbum verbo curabam red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere

            </p>
            <p>Accept, <hi>courteous Reader,</hi> or at least
<hi>pardon</hi> these my first <hi>adventures:</hi> I
have chosen a Subject generous and bold,
which may provoke some one better
qualified for it than my self, to add
those Ornaments which I were not able
to give.</p>

desire of the <hi>Learned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> whose farther
<hi>designe</hi> it was, that I should make known

Who could not think it enough

            <head>THE
PROEM
OF
WILLIAM GRIFFITH
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>TAke, <hi>Reader,</hi> to thy self, what
thou hast so long <hi>desir'd,</hi> the
<hi>new Edition</hi> of this polite <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Work;</hi> little indeed, if
thou regardest the <hi>bulk,</hi> and not the
<hi>merit</hi> of the <hi>Piece,</hi> to prevent the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
labour of <hi>transcribing</hi> so frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>requested Copies.</hi> This was the
<hi>Printers</hi> care, to whom I was willing to
<pb facs="tcp:35344:14"/>
condescend, that if I could any way be
<hi>ayding,</hi> this <hi>third Edition</hi> should come
forth more <hi>copious</hi> and more <hi>corrected.</hi>
To which end, if any thing were done
to the purpose by me, it is all to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to that worthy and excellent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
through whose favour the <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
World</hi> enjoys the <hi>lovely birth</hi>
of so <hi>divine a Wit;</hi> I mean, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Gentleman Sir <hi>John Birkenhead,</hi>
who was not satisfi'd to <hi>inter</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi>
the <hi>Ashes</hi> of the <hi>Author,</hi> who
was his <hi>intimate Acquaintance,</hi> unless
be might also preserve his <hi>Memory;</hi>
which he did, by exposing to the world
these <hi>draughts</hi> and <hi>descriptions</hi> of <hi>Love</hi>
deposited in his custody. They have
breathed forth <hi>Nard</hi> where're they came,
with the fragrant <hi>Odours</hi> of <hi>Amomum.</hi>
The <hi>name</hi> of the Author was absent
from the <hi>Title</hi> in the <hi>first Edition:</hi> For
then it crept forth, such was the sate of
<hi>those times,</hi> as the work of a person
who had been always <hi>faithful</hi> to his
<hi>Prince,</hi> and therefore thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb facs="tcp:35344:14"/>
to <hi>conceal his name,</hi> which was
all he could do. For it became not
<hi>such</hi> an <hi>Ingenuity</hi> to be <hi>conceal'd,</hi>
which like <hi>Royal Furniture</hi> carries its
<hi>peculiar marks</hi> where-ever it is found.</p>
            <p>Nor is that small <hi>Addition</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
I mean, the <hi>Tombstone-Enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium</hi>
upon the <hi>Prince</hi> of our <hi>English
Poets, BEN. JOHNSON,</hi> by
which he has rendered his Memory, with
his own, <hi>immortal;</hi> which the <hi>Author</hi>
finding most miserably mangled in a
Book called <hi>Johnsonus <unclear>Viribius</unclear>,</hi> was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
almost to make <hi>new</hi> again, that he
might <hi>restore</hi> it to its first <hi>splendour,</hi>
to himself a Peonian <hi>Apollo,</hi> renewing,
like the <hi>Pelican,</hi> that <hi>life</hi> which he had
given to his Off-spring once born, and
twice restored to life; born from the
<hi>hand</hi> and <hi>invention</hi> of the <hi>Author,</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
once from the <hi>Errours</hi> of the <hi>Press,</hi>
and a <hi>third</hi> time expos'd to <hi>Eternity</hi> by
the favour of the forementioned <hi>Knight.</hi>
The <hi>Author</hi> was deservedly number'd
among the <hi>chiefest Wits</hi> of his time, as
<pb facs="tcp:35344:15"/>
               <hi>Cartwright, Gregory, Diggs, Masterson,</hi>
and the rest: Who while they liv'd, Oh
Heavens how great they were! of all
whom for all, the noble <hi>Birkenhead</hi> onely
survives. These were the <hi>Tutelar Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi>
of <hi>Oxford,</hi> every one an Ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity
descended from Heaven; which
while she kept within her walls, <hi>Oxford</hi>
stood, yielding neither to the <hi>policy</hi> nor
<hi>force</hi> of her <hi>Enemies.</hi> In vain the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy</hi>
labour'd to intice these <hi>Heroes</hi> to
his Party: Whom nevertheless while a
greater force, <hi>piety</hi> and <hi>fidelity to their
Prince,</hi> carri'd several ways, whereby
their <hi>Pens</hi> were not able to assist the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Arms,</hi> reduced to <hi>Extremity,</hi> at length
the <hi>hostile fury</hi> prevail'd, while they
were otherwise employed; as the <hi>Temple
of Diana</hi> burnt at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> while she was
busie at the birth of <hi>Alexander.</hi> The
<hi>Enemy</hi> therefore having obtained his
<hi>wishes,</hi> proudly using his <hi>Victories,</hi> as it
were triumphing over <hi>Victory her self,</hi>
carried away as many of these <hi>Genius's</hi>
as he could meet with; believing he could
<pb facs="tcp:35344:15"/>
no otherwise restrain and curb those
<hi>divine Souls,</hi> than with <hi>Cords</hi> and
<hi>Chains.</hi> As the <hi>Tyrians</hi> tyed the same
golden Chain to the Ogmean <hi>Hercules,</hi>
lest he should desert them, which the
<hi>Gauls</hi> tyed to the tongue of the same
<hi>Deity,</hi> to attract and allure others. In
the midst of these <hi>Cruelties,</hi> the most of
those <hi>Heroes</hi> breathed forth their <hi>blessed
Souls,</hi> yet not yielding to <hi>fate,</hi> in regard
that every one of them has drawn <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Lines</hi> in their several <hi>Writings,</hi> as
amongst the rest,
ROBERT WARING has depainted <hi>The Effigies of Love</hi> to all Eternity.</p>

            <head>The Answer of R. W. to
his Friend, importunately
desiring to know what
LOVE might be?</head>
            <p>I Acknowledge the wanton Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of imperious Love, that is
always requiring the most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
Trials of the Affections.
Now though it be a kinde of an <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean</hi>
Labour it self <hi>to Love,</hi> considering
those severe duties, those toyls, and
hazards appendant to it; as if Cruelty
were its sole delight: Nevertheless we
believe it reasonable, what names so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we have given to <hi>Love,</hi> that he
should exercise his Soveraignty, which
is certainly very great and puissant;
and by the Severity of his Commands,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:35344:25"/>
that he should augment the glory of
his high Rule, and our obedient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.
Let him command as well
what is beyond, as well as what is
within the verge of our ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
all things, but only that one thing,
<hi>Not to</hi> Love. Let him command no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
below a Miracle, seeing that he
who exacts the duty, affords us also
Strength and Power, and raises our
Wit and Ingenuity above its self,
transforming Man into a Semi-Deity.
So that he cannot be said to Love,
who does not act beyond himself, and
pursue the accomplishments of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
with Enterprises equal to his
wishes. He is no thorough-pac'd Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
who does not something above
extraordinary, to gain his Prize.</p>
            <p>But justly do you redemand those
Affections, which you your self have
taught, though despoil'd of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceteness
and Eloquence. Will it so
delight ye, to behold in my devoted
Breast, as in a Mirrour, the reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35344:25"/>
resemblance of your self? Or to
take a thorough view of me, as being
a piece of your own workmanship?
because it is impossible that any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
stain should blemish your fair
Image; the very Spots whereof afford
a brightness, like those of the Sun.
Will you not however, like a haughty
Lady, be angry with the Looking-Glass,
that discovers to your sight
Freckles and Deformities not your
own, and throws a counterfeit Scandal
upon your Countenance? I know not
for what reason; but certain it is, that
we love the very miscarriages of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the disgraces of our own
Bodies; as old and maimed Images are
more religiously ador'd. Thus Parents
for the most part caress with a more
tender Affection, as it were to the
comfort of their Misfortunes, the
lamest and most deformed of their
Children; more vehemently admiring
these Monsters of the Womb, as the
Portenders of some great matter. We
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35344:26"/>
are pleased to behold the transposed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Members of a distorted body, moving
like Man's Anagram. Certainly, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi>
is a sacred thing, which much
more divine than Beauty, pleas'd the
antient Priests, that assum'd Divinity
under antie shapes, to render their
Oracles more reverend; which not
only terrifies us Mortals, but admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
us withal, that this Deformity
is rather to be ador'd than lov'd. Every
one is to himself the most pleasing The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ater,
and the most delectable Object;
and then the Eye seems to enjoy the
Dignity and delights of the Mind, when
it shoots its piercing sharpness back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
upon it self, at once both the
Spectator and the sight. Whatever it
be, that for double reasons renders us
doubly favoured by you, ought to be
most chiefly in our esteem; which if
it shew us lame or imperfect, under
that very notion either of injury or
antiquity, we are also for that very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to admire it. I am oblig'd to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35344:26"/>
that she hath afforded me a smooth
Table, from whence to take off so much
of your likeness, as to delight both her
self and you too. But it will be a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
indeed, that an Image should talk
any longer.</p>
            <p>But I am much more apt <hi>to love,</hi>
then speak a word, which covets ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be the subject of Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than Demonstration; and because
it keeps its station in the most secret
Recesses of the Heart, disdains acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
with the Tongue. A thing which
we poor Mortals never learn, either
from precept or examples; but then at
length all first began to understand,
when we had all practised the same
thing. You would say that Love were
not only blind, but Tongueless, who
has made all the joints of our bodies
vocal, unless the Tongue alone. Whence
it comes to pass, that Lovers more elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
make use of sighs than words,
to convey the Intelligence of their
secret flames, and like <hi>Paphian</hi> Doves
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35344:27"/>
weep enliven'd Epistles; by which
means they also discourse with their
eloquent Fingers, without the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of a Pen; and dialogue in signs,
with affable Nods, missary Smiles; and
by means of those vocal Messengers of
their Desires, hear each others mutual
Wishes, and read each others visible
Souls. At other times the Rhetorical
<hi>Tropes</hi> of Gesture woe in a mysterious
and various Idiome, while Pilgrim
Glances, seeming to be out of their
way, outwardly renouncing all fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity,
privately hold a strict corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
together.</p>
            <p>Their counterfeited Frowns display
an outward displeasure, when they are
studying all the charms of Friendship
in the midst of their Anger. At other
times their Souls taking reciprocal
flights from each others eyes, ravish
from each other Bridal Kisses at a
distance, returning in Triumph with
the Thefts of Embraces in thought.
And among all their Triumphs and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35344:27"/>
their Pleasures, this they look upon as
the chiefest, that the business lies hid.
So frequent a thing it is for Lovers to
appear upon the publick Stage, and
yet beguile the Spectators by disguising
the Comedy. These Angelic Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutors
seem indeed to be above all
humane Laws, and consequently by
most certain signs to understand each
others Wishes, to inspect each others
Entrails, and to manage their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
rather by way of Oracle than
Discourse; while they display in
thought a clearer discovery of each
others Mindes, before the addresses of
words, or that they know how to
deceive; and their Desires, like Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions,
shew themselves to the eye:
Such however as by no other Art are
to be seen, than that which bred them;
while issuing visibly from the Body,
they not only appear to the sight, but
assume the shape, and enliven the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whom they designe to discourse.
As if there were within the same Body
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35344:28"/>
a free Intercourse of restless and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
thoughts, that commune with
others abroad with no less silence than
they observe at home. This one Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
that cannot be exprest, is ador'd
as a Mysterie; whose sacred Rites, like
those of the most antient Deities, are
like Crimes protected by a modest
Shame and warie Silence. <hi>Love</hi> has
always its Vail; and the Adorers of
<hi>Venus,</hi> like <hi>Aeneas,</hi> walk envelop'd in
a Cloud, and keep themselves secret
in the most publick Assemblies of Men.
Nay <hi>Cupid</hi> himself, hardly content
with one Vail, delights to peep out of
his Ambushments, and to see the hearts
he daily wounds; beholding all, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unseen. Thus <hi>Love</hi> that compos'd
the world, kept his Station in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
lurking in the antient Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the primitive Chaos.</p>
            <p>Still doth <hi>Venus,</hi> as if she were a
Traitor, flie the Sun; and for fear of
being discover'd, I know not what
Divinity has inclos'd within a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35344:28"/>
not only the Affections of <hi>Pasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaë,</hi>
but the whole <hi>Love</hi> of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde;
or if at any time he chance to
be apprehended, he appears either like
one caught in a Net, or else in the
shape of a Monster. Thus in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance
to Mortals that love Riddles,
Love is become a Problem to himself,
living without Rule, and exercising
the Affections at his own pleasure;
while contrary Desires agitate him, no
less impetuously driven this way and
that way by the Ebbs and Flowings of
the Passions; from whence it may be
easie to infer, that the <hi>Cyprian Queen</hi>
was born upon the rowling Billows, in
the midst of contrary Winds. Strange
Riddles! That the same person should
both serve and live free, should be at
his own disposal, and at the command
of another; as it hapned to the Freed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours, who
govern'd their Lords and Masters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the title of Slaves! That this same
Love should both live and dye both at
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35344:29"/>
the same time, and like the <hi>Phoenix,</hi>
revive from the Ashes of his own Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Pile! Mad and malignant Wishes
of the same Lover, therefore to wish
his most beloved Favourite unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate,
only to have the opportunity
of being his Comforter! Therefore
to desire him depriv'd of Friends, and
bereav'd of Subsistance, that he may
have the honour of supplying both!
Therefore to wound, that he may be
the Author of the Cure! That Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
rather than Love and Merit should
enforce the Oblig'd to retaliation!
Not to know whether to desire the
Hatred and Enmity, or the Favour
and Kindness of his Friend! while Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
and Jealousie are equally mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous
in their undertakings. 'Tis
a piece of Inhumanity, to hinder the
effects of all other mens Kindness, only
to engross the Affection singly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
to remove and implead all his
other Rivals, as the injurious Authors
of his private wrongs: but above all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35344:29"/>
things, to be solicitously careful lest at
any time hereafter he should grow wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,
which might render him contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible;
with so much delight are Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
blindly misguided.</p>
            <p>See how an inamour'd breast grows
cold and hot reciprocally by fits, as it
fares with those in high Fevers; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any one that loves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
perfect indignation. Deservedly
he curses the pleasing Executioner, that
burns him in those flames, that rob
him of himself; Yet like a Butter-flie,
delights to play about those flames,
and enjoy the happy Author of his
Death.</p>
            <p>He seeks himself without himself,
and lingers to be taken, that being a
prisoner, he may be in a capacity to
redeem himself; and to be next to
himself, sticks close to his Possessor.
It is a difficult thing for him <hi>to love;</hi>
as difficult, <hi>not to love;</hi> but more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
than both, <hi>to enjoy Love.</hi> So
miserably is his afflicted Minde tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35344:30"/>
not so much with his own wishes
themselves, as with the necessary event
of what he desires. So that if the
Heavens prove propitious, to favour
him with success in his Love, he then
cries out again for his former miseries,
and that pleasing torment of sighing
and desiring. So much more grateful
it is to aspire to embraces, than to be
fetter'd in the Chains. Every one
more highly esteems the pleasure of
desiring, than the Desires themselves;
not likely to be happy in any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who complains of the event, and
with reluctance suffers his Sighs and
delightful Anxieties to be lost. Which
is the hard and cruel fate of Lovers,
that what way soever Fortune favour
them, they are still adversaries to their
Happiness.</p>
            <p>Whence comes it to pass, that he
flies the sight of her, the sight of
whom is his most pleasing Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
while he thinks it a new birth
to be admitted into her Presence?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35344:30"/>
What unhappiness is this, that he that
has his hearts desire, should not be
able to enjoy his own Wishes? That
Majesty encircled with the Graces,
both allures and terrifies. That Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
splendour of a most serene Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
both recreates and annoys
the sight. The Veneration of that
Divinity, which he hath feign'd ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
to himself, astonishes the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper,
suffering like a <hi>Cyclops,</hi> under
the oppression of his own Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts.
<hi>Love</hi> hath beguil'd him with
that imposture of Titles and Divinity,
that he believes the possession more
worthy than is fit for him to enjoy;
neither will Religion suffer him to
envy his misfortune; for what he
looks upon as a Divinity, he judges
not proper to be approach'd with the
Eye, but with the Minde alone.</p>
            <p>So carefully hath Heaven provided
for this Affection, by intermixing Fear
and Anguish with Joy, to render that
Pleasure more delicate. Hence it is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35344:31"/>
that our Desires so torment us, that
they may also delight us; and our
Delights are so infested with Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
to increase our Sorrows. They
are so sparingly distributed, that they
appear like the Ladies Faces, which
by their Silken Vails are but more
openly conceal'd. So that they may
be said to enjoy and to want, both
at one time; being such for whom
greater things are aimed at, than are
convenient to be allowed them: the
single felicities of a Glance, or a Smile,
or a short charming Discourse, being
enough at a time. Nevertheless, our
restless and hungry Passion, not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the sweet repasts either of
converse or view, attempts to taste
somthing yet more Divine, which it
is nor allow'd neither to obtain or
know. Neither do I know how it
comes to pass that this Misfortune
turmoils us, that because we are wont
to enjoy Felicity only in Dreams, we
are doubtful whether we possess what
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35344:31"/>
we really enjoy or no; and believing
that we still enjoy what we imagine
to be only Dreams and Shadows, we
refuse to be any farther deluded, and
therefore fear enjoyment.</p>
            <p>That Passion which settles all other
motions of the Minde, that reconciles
Men, Brutes, and Philosophers, is at
enmity with it self alone; by the ties
of Discord coupling things altogether
repugnant to each other. We are
not therefore to reproach him for
soft and tender, whose Arms are tired
only with Embraces; who always
breathes either Perfumes or Sighs; who
suffers himself to be cast to the ground
by the threats of a smooth Brow, or
the glance of an Eye. Neither are we
to account him <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>daring,</hi> that
endures the nocturnal Importunities
of his Cares, or the diurnal Sollicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his troubled Thoughts; or by
a tedious sufferance of Injuries, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
his greediness of Danger; so that
although his fears cease, he delights
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35344:32"/>
to dissemble more, and to invoke
Jeopardie and Hazard, as favours and
arguments of his Love: as if Paleness
and Wanness were the Symptomes of
Woing; or that the only way to prove
himself <hi>a Lover,</hi> were to make himself
miserable.</p>
            <p>On the other side, shall we count
a man stupid, because we finde that
Rigour and Disdain so frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
and provoke <hi>a Lover?</hi> That
person, believe me, is all transmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated
into Soul, or that Aethereal
particle of Fire, which feels no wounds.
Or if this seem a Riddle, know that it
is Loves <hi>Philosophy</hi> to vanquish Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
by Affection, and to assail one
Fire by another, though much the
brighter. Consider nevertheless, that this
is not the <hi>Stupidity,</hi> but the <hi>Heat</hi> of <hi>a
Lover.</hi> For as all Injuries contemn'd,
loose their end and perish: so being
kindly taken, they pass for Benefits; or
else like flints, are broken by that soft &amp;
tender Breast that gives them way.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:35344:32"/>Again, Why do we exclaim against
him for being mad, or blinde, who
beholds the spots and blemishes of his
Mistriss, as so many Ornaments and
little Stars; that he assignes her Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
for Beauties, and by a most
kinde mistake, extols and adorns her
failings, with the title of the nearest
resembling Virtues? The more she
needs it, the more curious is her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to dress and set her forth in his
own ascititious and borrowed Colours.
But in this case men prove partial
Censurers, not Friends, requiring
Judgment instead of Affection; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
to the Lover that most happy
Errour, which gives him his greatest
satisfaction. Suffer him to impose
that most honest deceit upon himself,
and to form in his Minde a more
Majestical resemblance of Her, whom
he has there decreed more seriously to
contemplate, and to worship more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly.
'Tis the custom of Painters
to pensil Faces not like, but fairer,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35344:33"/>
and to flatter the Original; polishing
his workmanship rather according to
the reflexion of the Mirrour, than
after the real Representative.</p>
            <p>Believe me, we are not to think
that Lovers have lost their Eyes,
which are only overshadow'd with a
Vail, through which they take their
prospect more clearly and securely.
Nevertheless you may think them three
quarters shut, as in persons taking
aim, that they may more judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
discern; and being fix'd upon
one Object, they are not only purblind
to all others, but loath the sight of
them, and quite close up themselves.
Now when the Eyes are wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
upon one Object, and employ all
their quickness and vigour upon that,
resolving, as it were for the nonce, not
to contemplate any thing else; this is
not to be dim, but too quick-sighted.
So that if to Philosophize be only to
<hi>contemplate Idea</hi>'s, then is it the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
work and office of Philosophie,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35344:33"/>
               <hi>to Love.</hi> Nay, if a man may be said
to love as much as he understands,
then that which is accounted the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Passion, that is to say, to be
ready to dye for Love, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd
an Argument of Knowledge.
Do but consider the Stratagems and
Sieges of <hi>Lovers,</hi> equal even to the
Assaults upon Cities, and winning of
Kingdoms. Behold the Virgins daily
led in Triumph, as the Trophies of
so many wilie Ingenuities, whom there
was a necessity of deceiving, before
they could be taken captive, and
brought to an unwilling submission
to their Admirers desires. So odly
do they choose rather to be deluded
than belov'd: As if they look'd upon
the Shackles of Wile and Fallacy to
be the forerunners to the Fetters of
Embraces. Consider how many great
Wits the word <hi>Mistriss</hi> has inspir'd;
how many Lyricks <hi>Amorous Desire</hi> has
begot; how extravagantly the rage
of wounded Hearts has taught the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatist</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:35344:34"/>
to wantonize. Then,
emulous of so much glory, thou wilt
cry, <hi>Give me an object to love:</hi> And
then instead of <hi>Apollo,</hi> the Darling of
<hi>Venus</hi> shall become thy Deity. He is
in an Errour, whoever he be, that
believes those things to be the raving
Dotages of a distracted Minde, which
are the Mysteries of divine Fury. Thus
the God of Love himself prosperously
governs the violence of his Actions,
though contrary to Reason. His right
hand never misses when he shoots the
Hearts of Mortals, though blinde, and
never aiming at the mark: For the
hand is not govern'd by the Eye, but
by an Inward and Divine Impulse.
Neither is <hi>Love</hi> led by Reason, but by
something more Celestial than Reason;
and as a <hi>Deity,</hi> that avoids Reason,
which might cause him to erre, acts
by a more certain Violence, and is
wise without Wisdome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To be wise,</hi> and <hi>to Love,</hi> how harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously
do they accord together! The
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35344:34"/>
first, in the first place, is the Attribute
of <hi>Jove</hi> himself; and next to him, of
a Prudent man, who, like an Oracle,
can unfold <hi>Who is the best of Mortals:</hi>
For it is impossible for any but the <hi>best</hi>
of Men <hi>to love.</hi> He is the only <hi>Lover,</hi>
whose Sentence, like that of Fate, is
irrevocable. He cannot be said to
love, whose Judgment fail'd, whose
Embraces ever err'd, or who at any
time had an incumbent Necessity to
hate.</p>
            <p>The Conjugal Obligation of Lovers,
like solemn Wedlock, admits of no
Divorce. When the Maiden-Girdle
is once unloos'd, that same Knot is
knit, which is never to be untied;
though like the <hi>Gordian</hi> Noose, it
may be sometimes cut asunder. So
though the ties of Souls may be cut
asunder by Death, they cannot be by
Death unloosed. Love ceases not,
though the thing beloved cease. A
Wife shall not seem old, when she is
really in years; for still that Form,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35344:35"/>
now withered and decayed, shall
flourish in the faithful breast of her
Husband; and she that hath so far
suffer'd a change, as to be almost un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
shall still remain in memory
belov'd. Then also when the Fates
have snatch'd away the Mistriss of
my heart, as if only separated by
intervals of absence, then shall she
surviving breathe in my never-forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
breast: and while I embrace the
beloved Apparition, I will deny her
dead. Fond <hi>Destinies!</hi> ye have spent
your Malice in vain; we still converse,
and still are two. From others ye
have forced a Virgin, from me not so
much as a Shade. Before, we enjoy'd
only the same Soul; now, Body and
Soul together. She is reunited to us
as to her particular Sphere.</p>
            <p>Now Love may seem to have finisht
his Circle, who always returns in that
manner to the place from whence he
sets forth, as if he intended with his
perpetual Motion to imitate the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35344:35"/>
Circumgyration; so ending in
himself, that he may begin again. For
he cannot be said to Love, who can
at any time either slacken, or not love
at all. There is not the same deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
or satiety of Love, as of
other things; neither is it satisfied
like Hunger or Thirst. Love is not
extinguish'd by satisfaction, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inflam'd
with new delights, and every
day findes new objects of pleasure in
his beloved Features. He takes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
recreation, a perpetual greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
seizes him, and he always findes
somthing yet farther to desire. Like
a minde devoted to Contemplation,
or like the Heaven it self, he moves
perpetually, never rests; never weary,
but refreshed by toyl: thus the end
of one Benefit is the step to the next,
which taking its rise from a redoubled
heat, first cherishes the person, and
then its own favours.</p>
            <p>Love ought to be immortal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as consecrated to Eternity, or
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35344:36"/>
whether it be, because he always supplies
the Misfortunes that happen by Death.
For who knows not, that the Death
and last Will of a Lover both go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
while the expiring Lover breaths
out his Soul, to be read in his last sigh,
whereby he constitutes her the sole
Heiress, sending back all his Affections
thither from whence he last departed?
With whom it fares, as with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Philosophers, to be hurried out
of themselves, to enjoy a perpetual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie
of Life; and to be depriv'd of
their own Souls, that anothers may
take their place. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> as a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
not as a Philosopher, makes me
believe the Transmigration of the Soul.
Which in a fleeting posture, as it were
at pleasure laying aside her proper
Vestments, and putting off the Spoils
of the Body, hastens to more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Mansions, and a fairer Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as it were to another <hi>Elysium.</hi>
There is no man happy before this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease,
of which <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Philosophy</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:35344:36"/>
are the Cause: while this from the
Body frees the Soul, pleasingly swoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
away in Contemplation; the
former sends it forth to the Embraces
of new <hi>Amours.</hi> Thence a loathing,
hence the flight and <hi>Exit</hi> of its self;
both ways eagerly desiring a hasty
dissolution, as if covetous to perish
like the <hi>Arabian</hi> Wonder. We finde,
that among some of the nicer sort of
Ladies, upon the first sight of a noble
Structure, there is a distaste and
haughtie disdain of the Building; then
a peregrination to those flowry Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopies,
wherein because they had not
the chance to be born, they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to abide as Strangers, and wax
old together; or rather to be born
again, by renewing the first principles
of Life. Whoever denies these to be
the Excursions of Transmigrating
Souls, let him more attentively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
how the Soul still directs her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to that part, where she may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
nearest to her Lover. If two
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35344:37"/>
Lovers joyn right Hands, you would
swear their Souls were to be felt in
their Fingers, and that they mutually
interweav'd themselves together. If
they close side to side, you shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their very Bowels to leap for
joy, and the mustering Spirits taking
the alarm, assembled together in a
body, beat and salute each other with
frequent Pulses, and as it were strive
to make way by breaking Prison. I
would fain know what secret Charm
that is, which summons all the blood
into the Face, at the sight of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Object, and causes the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer
of the wound to flie upon the
Assassinate; just as the blood of a slain
Corpse bursts forth at the appearance
of the Homicide, returning the wound
to him that gave it: The purple
stream, by what Instinct I know not,
here hastening to Revenge, there
speeding to apply the most present
Remedy. Behold how greedily those
souls that stand Sentinel in the Ears,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35344:37"/>
catch the Sounds, and presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
themselves into the same. The
spirits interchange in the mixture of
words, and enter into those very
wishes which the Tongue expresses.
Those Souls that with a continued
succession dart themselves from the
Eyes, consume themselves with gazing,
and languish away with frequent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding.
To all true Lovers, it is the
same thing to speak and to expire, to
see and to abandon himself, to behold
and transmigrate into the Object. Thus
the whole man speeding to make his
<hi>Exit,</hi> throws himself sometimes into
the Eye, sometimes into the Ear; and
only lives in that part, where he enjoys
the object of his Love. Thus <hi>Love</hi>
compels men to live more contracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and like some imperfect Animals
to be contented with one Sence; and
yet this to render a man not imperfect,
but more Divine, by how much he
requires the fewer Instruments of Life.</p>
            <p>However, the Soul is advantaged
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35344:38"/>
by the Bodies loss. For by a certain
extension of its Spiritual Bulk, that
which seem'd confined to one Breast,
now governs two; as if it had two
Lives. Distracted between two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
it scarcely knows for which it
was first formed; such is the Increase
that all true <hi>Love</hi> produces. As it
fares with people that have drank
over-hard, all things appear double to
Lovers: but no otherwise double, than
as the Eyes are so; of which there is
but one only Motion, one Sight alone.
You may see two so closely folded in
each others embraces, that they seem
to be but one. 'Tis the same thing
which desires and is desired; that
knows not whether it love more true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or be beloved more ardently;
that cannot be said so much to enjoy,
as to be converted into the wish itself.
Ah! bountiful <hi>Cupid,</hi> thou play'st foul
play, while thou hidest within my
Breast what I desire to embrace. Thou
art too favourable; act somewhat more
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35344:38"/>
rigidly; order it so, that we may be
two, that we may finde our selves to
be what we would be. In vain I beg;
excess of Enjoyment will not suffer
it: It cannot be; I would divide what
is but still the same. To will and nill
the same thing, affords much of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Irksomness, nothing of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sortship.
While we consult, we only
mutually agree; we do not mutual
Offices of Kindness, but incorporate
our pleasure. I seem to embrace a
shadow for my Mistress, that presses
close at my heels, and imitates my foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps.
Forbear, my <hi>Fairest,</hi> I beseech
thee, more neer to me than my self;
order it so, that we may wish well to
each other, but love less. By how
much the more simple and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
every thing is, by so much
the more perfect it is. Not to be
comprehended, circumscribed either
by Number or Place, is the mark of
a Deity. Whatever is Best, and most
supremely Chief, ought to be singly one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:35344:39"/>As Love therefore has this mark of
Perfection, that is to say, Unity in an
high degree; so is it dignified with
another badge of Perfection, to be
<hi>Communicative.</hi> For whatsoever is
perfect, has this strange way to mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply
and increase, by distributing and
dealing it self into many parts. This is
one part of his Revenue, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riches
and advances others. Hence it
was that this bountiful Deity, born
for the tutelage of Humane Kinde, as
prone to Love, as worthy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of all men, first instituted that
generous sort of Liberalitie, to give
himself to another; which is the good
that may be called mans Propriety,
and is his primitive Gift. Other Gifts
are not to be accounted our own, that
is to say, the Graces and Favours of
Heaven and Fortune; which are no
more in our power to bestow, than to
give away the Sun, or the common
Air we breath, and onely enjoy by
permission.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:35344:39"/>Whoever loves, approaches nearest
to the Deity, and, like the Deity, makes
this his only business, <hi>To do good.</hi> No
less therefore than they who boast
corporeal Strength, do they who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
in Vigour of Minde, feel in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
the titillations of generation,
that is to say, of Speaking and VVri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
which are the travails of the
Brain, and a chast desire to propagate
Virtue. For the wrestling Inward
Soul, and throbbing Spirits, compel
fruitful Capacities to powre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
forth, as the inward heat of
Fountains forces up the boyling wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
So far is Love from proceeding
of VVant, that it rather seems to be
Opulency it self, whose chiefest aim is
the relief of Nature; unless any one
will account the Remedies Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
because they are joyn'd with the
diseases. VVe are to complain of the
distresses and straits of Nature, since
Love has indulg'd us this noble Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of Humane Kinde, whereby
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35344:40"/>
every one delivers himself, and takes
another; and whatever is divine in
another, he transfers into his own
Coffers: the Heir to anothers wealth,
and supplying his wants from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of his female Friend.</p>
            <p>And yet I am deceived, or there is
no Traffick in Friendship, neither is
this the true Rule of Love, <hi>Love that
thou maist be beloved. Gratis,</hi> and not
in hopes of Gain, we give freely away
to another, this same Thing, whatever
we are; yet with a desire of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating,
though it be our hap to
change. For what more liberal and
free Examples of Loving, than those
of <hi>God</hi> and Parents? VVhose Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
above all Gratitude, can only
be ador'd, but never retaliated. Yet
where all endeavour of Gratitude
might well be adjudg'd malapert and
impossible, there are some glimpses of
a submissive return, while the VVor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper
of a Deity makes him in some
measure to be a God by Adoration.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35344:40"/>
And who from his Parents receives a
short use of Life, repays him with a
posthumous <hi>being,</hi> no less the Heir
than Guardian of his transmitted Soul.
Behold the Vine, more truely <hi>Cupid</hi>'s
than <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s tree, how with a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Arms, a thousand Embraces, it
courts the Oak her Husband, to the
end she may afford to him, by whom
she is supported, a more plentiful Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
and Succour. She loads him
with no other burthens than juicie
Pearls, and shade to defend from the
Injuries of the weather him that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stains
her. Love never seeks, but
brings assistance. So that it is a mark
of Grandeur, and the grand Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of those above, more willingly,
more gladly to <hi>love,</hi> than be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
            <p>Hence then, you who believe,
that like the feeble beasts, men only
propagate for safety, rather than for
Friendships sake. Know, that <hi>Love,</hi>
whom once you thought <hi>a Boy,</hi> is
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35344:41"/>
now grown up to Maturity. Know,
that to these Mysteries whatever is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
or of weak and tender years, is
forbidden to approach. Neither
Children, nor Old-men, nor above all,
any of perverse and froward Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are to serve under <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
What an inequality of Combat
is that, where it will be a shame either
to vanquish or overcome, where to
flie will be more honourable? What
League or Commerce can there be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
those, who have nothing in
common but only this, <hi>That they
live?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And why should that wanton Age
be admitted, that changes Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
like the Sports it uses? In whom
not to understand the Causes of Love
and Hatred, is the Merit of their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence,
and a Vertue deserving Pity?
Which as it renders to all Parents e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
Duty and Affection, deserves for
that reason their Parents Indulgence.</p>
            <p>What should we do with that other
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:35344:41"/>
over-rigid fag-end of Life, no less
troublesom to its self than others?
That Age which only doats upon a
Staff, and takes a piece of Wood for
a Man, to support himself; who is as
often angry as his Gout rages, and
querulously imputes his Diseases, as
Crimes, to his Friend? Who with a
Minde, as trembling and shivering as
his Body, suspects all People and all
Sexes. He fears all Kindnesses, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to ensnare him. To seek to
please him, is to act the Surgeon, and
embalm the dead. He envies me
the Sports of Youth, or else corrects
them according to the Exemplar of
his past Life. He blames my actions,
that he may applaud his own, too
neerly my Rival. You'd think him
crazed, to hear him repeat the Stories
of his Youth, and make his own Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs.
Nay, he continually chides
and bauls at me, because I am not as
old as he, that we may dye together.
I seem to stand before a Magistrate,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:35344:42"/>
not a Companion. What man, more
cruel than <hi>Mezentius,</hi> would espouse
dead Carcases to warm Embraces? or
disturb the Pleasures of Life with
maundring Counsel and unseasonable
Advice? What unequal Judge is that,
who would command me to live
backward with a man of another Age?
VVith whom to live in familiarity, is
a Crime; to reverence, is to proscribe
him without the bounds of <hi>Love</hi> and
Laws of Humanity, by a kinde of
Canonization. To whom this only
remains, to intrigue themselves with
the Amours of others, to intermix
their Precepts and Directions like
Philters, to teach and wish. For these
poor Creatures only twinkle like an
expiring Snuff; they live only to shew
they have lived; and usurp the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of <hi>Hymen,</hi> to grace their Funeral-Pomp,
and light 'em to their Graves.</p>
            <p>But when Youth and Beauty court
each other, there is the perfection of
delight. For true Love is a desire of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35344:42"/>
real Beauty; which real Beauty is not
humane and mortal, but immortal
and divine. So that they who asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
with this divine Beauty, live not
in this world, but as it were in Heaven,
like so many Deities. For they are a
sort of Deities, who despise mortal
things as <hi>divine;</hi> and aspire to divine
things as <hi>mortal.</hi> Now for a Man to
love a beautiful Woman, is not to
love another, but in part to love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or rather the other half of himself.
For Man at first had two Faces, four
Hands, four Feet, and all other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
alike; but afterwards he was
divided into two Sexes, as now he
remains, by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> against whom he
adventur'd to rebel. But misliking
this Separation, and willing to return
to his first estate, as they rose upon
their feet, both the halves closed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
again, as they have done ever
since; and this is called <hi>loving</hi> and
<hi>being loved.</hi> For when a Man loves a
Woman, he seeks his other half; and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35344:43"/>
the same thing do Women, when they
fix their Affections upon Men.</p>
            <p>However, this is the supreme Office
of Reason, to make a right choice of
Disposition and Conditions; to choose
a Companion with whom we are sure
to live with more delight than with
our selves; whose judgment we may
be sure to follow as our own: or else
to stay till we can finde a proper Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Love. Then also so to love,
like one who is guided by Judgment,
not carried away by Passion; like one
so far from ceasing, that he is always
beginning to <hi>Love.</hi> This is to joyn
Patience with Constancy. This is to
receive the <hi>Idea</hi> more fairly imprinted
in the Minde, than in Wax, and to
preserve more stedfastly. 'Tis the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of Vertue, to determine upon one
measure of wishing; to covet a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
and inclination like his own,
through all the changes of Fortune;
and so to make two of one, that they
may act the same person. They are to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35344:43"/>
be such, as of necessity ought to have
the same Will, having no other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
but what are virtuous and noble.
There ought also to be an exact Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
because they are to impart
the Virtues which they possess, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Envy; and therefore eagerly desire
to communicate the Riches of the
Minde. It being the part of a candid
Soul, like the Light of Heaven, to
lavish it self with a perpetual Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality.
It is a firmer Bond, than the
<hi>Stoic's</hi> Chain of the Fates, which cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
the alliance of Souls, not so much
to have the same Parent, as to have
the same Original of Life, that is to
say, <hi>Reason;</hi> and which has a more
vital vigour to be fill'd with the same
honest Affections, rather than with
the same Blood: that the Heart should
be smitten with the same Desires, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than that the Arteries should spin
the same Spirits. 'Tis a small thing
to believe the same Soul, only some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
separated in two Bodies, to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35344:44"/>
have the same Thoughts in two Minds.
There can be no distraction of thoghts,
where there is nothing left to make a
distinction of Two. For whatever
distinguishes, at length separates; nay
sometimes propinquity of Alliance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
a fiercer Enmity, which often
happens among half Kindred.</p>
            <p>In vain do Vices imitate the leagues
and ties of Friendship, as they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ape several other acts of
Vertues. In vicious men, to have the
same Delights, as well as to have the
same Mistresses, kindles Hatred out of
Love. To have the same Benefits,
(though this sounds more religiously,
than to have the same Parents) ill
grounded upon familiarity, feeds En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy;
and begets louder brawls, than
those of Crows or Coheirs, that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
prey upon each other. There
are none that will envy them, but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
how they came together: rather
they will deny any Complacency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, but only as it fares with
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35344:44"/>
those that sail both in one Ship, whom
Fears and Dangers knit together;
who are no sooner come ashoar, but
their Friendship shipwracks, as if they
had met with a Land-storm; and their
affection to Trade rather than Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
separates some one way, some
another. With what Fidelity can they
agree with others, whom nothing of
Kindness, but a loathing of themselves,
have constrained to this custome of
Society? With much ado they endure
themselves, and strive to shun them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
among the Croud; not out of
any delight, but to ease themselves as
much as lies in their power. For who
can please them, who are displeased
with themselves? Who abominate
undefil'd conditions, and unlike their
own, and dread them, as the Guilty
do the Seat of Justice. Emulous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
(as if they fear'd to be try'd by
Imitation) as Rivals, lest they should
be excluded, they utterly exclude, and
like the deformed, fly the sight of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35344:45"/>
Mirrour. This is the first punishment
of Improbity, by her own Sentence to
be condemn'd among men to the most
desert of Solitudes, and unfaithfull
Society: with much labour to act all
things in vain; by Obsequiousness to
purchase the favour of others; to let
out his mercenary Soul to Flattery; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
to court his Friends, but no
otherwise than as we clean our shoes,
and take care of our Cattle, that they
be the more serviceable to us: to toil
for his own sake, to meet with Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
in the midst of his profusion;
and among all these Allurements of
Fortune, to fear and doubt, and be
tormented with a hatred and loathing
of himself. Who would chuse him for
his other self, whom he sees to be his
Adversary? Or who would accept the
severe Favour of him, whom he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
love with the same Affection as he
loves himself? Whose most serene
looks, like those of <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Fortune,</hi>
he ought to fear; and timorously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35344:45"/>
his own Joys as snares, or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
perishing with the next Sun and
Winde. Methinks I see Twins at strife
with each other, the Embraces of
Wrestlers, the Countenances of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorcements;
contrary flights, always
avoyding each other. Hence, thou
Prodigy of <hi>Venus;</hi> Nature abhors
those more than Monsters, being the
Copulations and mixtures of Creatures
of various kinds: Who like the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Emperours, Married solemnly for
a time; but when the humour was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
dissolved their Nuptials, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
their Divorces as often as the
heat of their desire cool'd. Whose
Favours continue but the short space
of a Banquet, which presently dismisses
the Guests when their Bellies are full:
Who are altogether ignorant of what
they so eagerly desire; an accidental
Affection, springing from the Rage of
Desire, as <hi>Venus</hi> formerly from the rage
of the Sea. Sustain'd by the Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness
of Errour, but voluntarily
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35344:46"/>
condemn'd, so soon as they come to
themselves. I may say indeed, that
whosoever loves through violence of
Passion or Distemper, may be thought
to burn and rage like men in Feverish
Fits, but never truely to consent, or
harmoniously to agree.</p>
            <p>It was not for the maintenance of
Luxury, but for the Instruction of the
world, that Nature, like <hi>Lycurgus,</hi>
provided by a more severe Edict, that
no person should be without his Friend.
Prudently done, that the same Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
should be imposed upon us, of
Living and Loving; and that the same
Heat should cherish and inflame the
Hearts of Men. Thus the <hi>Epicureans,</hi>
who could think themselves secure
without the Protection of the Gods,
could not live without <hi>Love,</hi> the Fear
and Religion whereof render'd their
Lives more pleasant. So prone we are
rather to feign than confess a Deity.
And because it is natural to us, to be
acted by the Instinct of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:35344:46"/>
by the same Zeal of Superstition, lest
we should want an Object of Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we adopt into our Friendship
Dogs, Cats, and whatever idle <hi>Egypt</hi>
worshipt. Nay, for want of Woers,
the impatient <hi>Gellia</hi> commits Adultery
with her own reflexion in the Looking-Glass;
and what <hi>Egypt</hi> would have
been asham'd of, a more filthy creature
than all the Monsters of <hi>Nile,</hi> she falls
in lustful Love with her self: in this
only to be pardon'd, for that the same
Madness possesses all Mortals, rather
to love insipidly than not at all.
Other Affections, being either at our
own disposal, or wasting with their
own violence, easily vanish. Grief, if
it doth not give way to Reason, yields
to Time or Hatred. <hi>Hatred</hi> itself re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
by crabbed Choler, or stifled
by Fear, grows first of all displeasing
to it self. Fear also, if other Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
are wanting, may be oppressed
by the evils themselves; and overcome
by its own weight, may be cured by
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35344:47"/>
Insensibility. Anger also, the fiercest
of all the Passions, tamely changes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a kinde of Clemency; or being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
buries its fury in the wound.
This is the only Passion that riots in
Adversity, and wantonizes in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression:
not born, like the rest, to be
extinguish'd; but being content to
cease, it passes into Necessity and a
voluntary Fate. Spontaneously it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robes
it self of that Liberty, which it
has consum'd in choosing that, which
with a perpetual desire it may both
possess and prosecute: what is distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
it may at some time utterly hate.
For what shame or curb can there be
upon Desire, whose wishes though
erroneous, yet with an ingenuous
Errour, aspire to what they think the
noblest of all things? He is also estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the most unworthy, who is not
mad beyond all measure; who coveting
more, still thinks he covets not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
and more enjoying, believes
he enjoys not enough; in vain ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauding
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35344:47"/>
himself as always happy.</p>
            <p>So it is, Nature has by the same E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
ordained, that we should love
none, or not the best. The first of
which is, with an inhumane Pride to
condemn all humane Kinde. The other
is the worst sort of Parricide, to make
away with himself; who having the
choice of Life, who being the Arbiter
of his own Nativity, when it is in
his power to create himself anew in
another, had rather perish. There is
but one Kingdome of the Heart, like
that of <hi>Alexander,</hi> which is due to the
best; whom to finde out, is well worth
the labour of Life. A person en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
with all the perfections of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
adorn'd with the whole <hi>Hyperbole</hi>
of Vertue, which we may either
meet with or feign; which man has
only the liberty to know, not to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess.
Such an one, that when we have
form'd in our impossible Wishes, we
shall finde at length to be, either an
<hi>Idea</hi> or a Deity. But now you'll say,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35344:48"/>
we have imagined one too worthy, as
to be above being lawful to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
as being only fit for Adoration.
That which is worthy of Love, is more
worthy of being worship'd. These
flames are only due to Altars. Nature
indulg'd this desire, which she is not
able to satisfie, as a reproach to her
self. But lest that should become a
Torment, which she intended as one
of her chiefest Graces; whatever is
wanting in the things themselves, she
would have supplied by our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Opinion, that at least we may
be happy in our Frenzy. We are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
by the supposititious Fucus or
false colouring of Beauty, and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
before we seem happy. Like
<hi>Pigmaleon,</hi> we fall in love with the
Statue which we have made, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
it to be carved, but begotten.
Deluded by the Darkness of our own
Mist, we embrace our Cloud for <hi>Juno:</hi>
and it delights us to be deceived. So
natural it is to Humanity to fail, to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35344:48"/>
erre and be beguil'd. The Imposture
is not put upon our Misfortunes, but
upon our Wishes; to the end the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
may more gainfully delight than
the juggles of Accomptants, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
with a specious sort of Gain. For
that indeed we are more certainly
happy in our Credulity, and as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
among many, we are richer in
the fame and opinion of our Wealth,
than in the ampleness of our Fortunes.
Most auspicious Gifts, not of Fortune,
but of Imagination! Oh Prodigie of
Riches never to be foregone, as oft as
we think it requisite to be angry with
the Gods, or jeast with Fortune!
Which no Violence nor no other opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
can ravish from us, but only to
supply us with more. Let it be so,
let Variety delight Opinion, as the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of Fortune or Nature; yet shall
she not admit Monsters for varieties
sake. She does not wantonnize in this
Levity, but strives to supply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of things. For the Vicissitudes
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35344:49"/>
of Affections and things, are compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for Solace and Remedy, not for
nice inspection. 'Tis not mans fault,
but the Reproach and Infelicity of
Nature, that we reprehend the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and alternative humours of
Love. That put off their old Friends,
like their old Cloaths; that slightly
taste Men, as Bees do Flowers. To
whom because we propound a Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Love, it cannot be thought Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy,
but Judgment, to wander with
delight, and sip from all Plants, that
of which they can never finde enough.
There is nothing that deserves a long
Embrace. Those things we so much
boast of, are not Vertues, but the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of Vertue: which like Pictures
that are to be lookt on at a distance,
will not endure a near, a close survey.
The whole name of Constancy is not
so much worth, that I should not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
clearer Merits; that I should not
regard the greater Stars, because I was
once born under lesser; that I should
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35344:49"/>
love my Diseases and Distempers, lest
I should be said to have changed my
former Condition; that I should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to Chance, or what more often
erres, my own Judgment, as to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Destiny. Suffer me, pray now,
more vehemently to admire these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of a Diviner Genius, which first
astonish'd me in thee, grown to a riper
perfection in another. Permit those
progresses in Love, which thou
thy self hast begot, cherish'd up.
Thou who hast taught me to prefer
the candor of the Minde, before the
Snow of Lillies; and rude Sincerity,
before soft but over-foolish Courtesie,
hast now taught me, upon the sight of
a brighter splendour, to despise thee;
unless from thence I may not seem so
much to contemn, as to adore thee,
under a most illustrious Image. Thus
lesser Tapers are not extinguished, but
out-shone; and less Stars for shame ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scond
themselves, when a more splendid
Constellation rises. Why dost thou
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35344:50"/>
invoke the Faith of Gods and Men?
Thou art belov'd by me on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
while thou either art, or
seemest to me to be beyond compare,
the best of all.</p>
            <p>Behold the insensible Love-sports of
Nature! behold how she has excited
the worst of all her pieces to work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
to the best of Actions, out
of an admiration of a more excellent
Beauty. It was the Will of Nature,
conscious to her self of Injury, and
shameful sloath, which oftner brings
forth Abortives, than perfect Births:
and therefore she has endued them
with an Operative Faculty, to enable
them to come nearer their <hi>Idea's,</hi> and
owe their own polishing to themselves.
Hence the <hi>Marigold,</hi> though fixed in
the Earth, follows the flight of the
Sun; and sucking in his Beams with
a greedy appetite, becomes a vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Star. With the same emulous
Ardour while the Stones imbibe the
Ethereal flames, they receive a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35344:50"/>
Brightness and solid Light; and
they that were the excrements of a
hard and rigid heap, become Jewels,
and shine no less in the Rock, than in
the Lovers Rings. By this alluring
Art, while the Ocean admits as well
the Image as the Motion of the Moon,
it seems to correspond with the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of the Celestial Orb. By this
lovely Envy, while Iron is drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
as it were with admiration of
the Magnet, by and by becomes the
Magnet it self; it exercises all its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and draws, as it was drawn
before. Though Philosophers were
wanting, we have the Mathematical
waves, that tell us of the Eclipses of
the Moon, more certainly than the
<hi>Ephemerides.</hi> We have your Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer-Flowers,
that teach us the
Motion of the Sun, and instead of
Dyals, shew us the time of the Day.
And though there were no Spectators
of this Theatre, yet is universal Nature
ravish'd with a Veneration of it self:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35344:51"/>
And as both the Eyes of the World,
so both Worlds contemplate and feed
themselves with the mutual sight of
each other. Nature hath ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
for her affairs, by committing
the World to the Guardianship of
Love; so that an idle Deity may be
either denied or contemned.</p>
            <p>But when other things are so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
as to receive and want, only
Man knows how to love. In those
things she has only rough drawn an
imperfect Affection, to practise in les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
things, what she intended to bring
to perfection in Man. Though I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
this Affection of men hath the
same original and growth, as man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
being as it were at several births
endow'd with Life, Sense and Reason.
For Love at first unfeather'd, creeps
along by the instinct of formless Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy;
then it comes to use the wings
of Desire; after that it matures to
Manhood, becomes Reason, which was
before the violence of Passion, or the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35344:51"/>
weight of the predominant Element.
For while the Infant-heat sits brooding
in the Heart, ere it has hatch'd the
panting sparks, Desire dares hardly
give credit to itself. When the new-wounded
Heart, uncertain of the
Smiters hand, or of the hurt itself,
feels the pains of Infants, when their
Teeth first cut their Gums: but when
Desire encreasing, they begin to kiss
and bill, then Ring-doves you behold,
not Men: When in wanton Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they make their Amorous moans,
then you hear the Turtles voice, who
being by Nature compos'd to Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
with a harmless Affection pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
their innocent Loves, while
Dolphins and Lizzards prefer humane
kinde. But a more generous Passion
seizes Men whose flames are of full
maturity, though blinde enough per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps.
By this blinde force, like the
<hi>Idalian</hi> Doves with their eyes sealed
up, we are carried upward, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly
strive with all our might to
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35344:52"/>
reach Heaven, as our Nest. In this
manner do the very Vices of Lovers
shew a nature covetous of Divinity,
and the very Errours of this Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
breathe somwhat immortal. So that
that more impure Desire which derides
the Nuptials of the Virtues, and the
Copulation of Mindes, that seeks for
something to fill its embraces, and
worships <hi>Venus,</hi> though threatning
Storms and Shipwrack to its Nativity,
seems to be inflam'd not so much with
the Tapers of <hi>Hymen,</hi> as with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of Eternity; while it so eagerly
seeks to survive itself, and by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
series<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Succession to survive
itself. He, whom a Supper makes
thee his Friend, and a Morsel causes
to sawn upon thee like a Beast,
who loves thy Dainties, not thee: He
that values Man, as he values his Farm,
and exercises mercenary Love with a
trafficking Soul; the one makes use of
Love like Money, but the Money of
the Gods, by means whereof we traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:35344:52"/>
with Heaven, and enrich ourselves
with Divinity; the other enjoys his
Love for the advantage of Luxury and
Banquets: for Love is accounted the
Nectar of the Gods. Both certainly
with less Covetousness provide for
their own advantage, whether he that
seeks for a Patrimony, or for food out
of Affection, than he who with a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral
Minde hastens to give away pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing
Riches, and to transfer them
out of the reach of Fortune or Fate,
before they are quite decay'd. Who
though he expect no return of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
yet carries off a vast gain, which
is, <hi>That he hath done a Kindness;</hi> So
that although he gave greatly away,
yet his recompence is much larger, that
is, <hi>Vertue.</hi> Great Gifts, and such as
Modesty almost forbids us to receive,
are more profitable to the Donor, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
because they render him the more
rever'd, as from whom little things
are not expected; or because he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows
a Benefit more necessary than
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:35344:53"/>
that of <hi>Jove,</hi> or the Sun itself; as from
whom Benefits are lookt upon as
Debts, paid by him out of Duty and
Custome; whose Munificence is such,
as if he intended to loose the benefit
of Thanks, through the largeness and
frequency of his Bounty.</p>
            <p>What shall I think of him, that
seeks to please, and not to love?
Whom I visit like a Summer-tree,
which affords me leasure and shade,
but of no use in the depth of Winter;
to whom we that love more severely,
are often us'd: thunder out this Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
The name of <hi>Friend,</hi> like that
of <hi>Wife,</hi> is a name of Dignity, not
of Pleasure. Thou hast invented a
new Delight, beyond that of embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing.
By this sort of Wantonness,
worse than that of the Stews, thou
hast deflowr'd <hi>Love</hi> it self. Diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to please, is the Art of Flatterers,
and the alluring venome of Harlotrie
Society: Splendidly to entertain, is
the Intrigue of those that fish for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:35344:53"/>
their own ends; to soothe with Bribes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the common trick of Suitors; the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
of loving, not the life of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
Far be it from us to believe
him to be a Friend, whom while we
desire, he is a torment to us; when
we enjoy him, irksome. Yet they are
not far out of the way, who believe
all <hi>Lovers</hi> inhabit <hi>Elysium,</hi> and that
Flowers spring up, wherere they tread.
There are no other Joys in Heaven,
than to <hi>Love</hi> and be Belov'd; no other
upon Earth. That divine Flame which
makes the <hi>Empyreum,</hi> and is to be the
Happiness of our future Life, shall be
the only Solace of this. All other
things we suffer; those only we enjoy,
which we pluck up by force with our
wishes, which we chuse, and for whose
sake we endure all other Hardships.
In Storms we see the Brethren <hi>Twins,</hi>
with an earnest gladness rejoycing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and bringing no less liquid
Joys to the Saylors than to themselves;
but having joyn'd their Lights, they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:35344:54"/>
loose themselves in their Embraces,
and become Twins again. We have
seen the Favourites of <hi>Venus</hi> encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd
with a Cloud, like young
Brides under their silken Veils, led to
their wishes with a more secret Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.
We confess, there is in Love
something more potent than Misery,
more Majestical than Honour, more
splendid than Riches, more delightful
than Pleasure; for whose sake we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
all those things; for whose sake
on the other side we do not contemn,
but have those things in Veneration.
It enjoys that Priviledge of Majesty,
that no Ignominy can touch it: rather
it frees from Infamy, and renders glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
the very stains and blemishes of
Life. Hence it comes to pass, that
the Thirteenth Labour of <hi>Hercules</hi> is
so much applauded, and that it is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd
among his praise-worthy deeds
to have handled a Distaff, as well as
brandish'd his Club; wherewith, after
he had vanquish'd all other wilde
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35344:54"/>
Beasts, it remain'd for him to tame
that Monster <hi>Woman.</hi> Why do we
admire those immaculate Rays of <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
since the Tapers of <hi>Hymen</hi> give a
lustre to sordid things, being never
themselves defil'd?</p>
            <p>Why does the famish'd Soul so sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitously
seek Divinity in things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
if it bring Divinity along with
it? And indeed whatever we love, all
that is Deity; <hi>Whatever thou desirest is</hi>
Jupiter. How? Does <hi>Jupiter</hi> buy and
sell for that sordid person stampt all
over, that admits no Companion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Dowry? Yes; but <hi>Jupiter</hi> thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
under the shape of Gold, and
the Deity converted into a <hi>Price.</hi>
How, Does <hi>Jupiter</hi> itch with a libidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Desire? Yes; but <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the
shape of a Satyr, and the Deity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into <hi>Semeleian</hi> flames. <hi>Jupiter</hi>
invites himself to Supper; but <hi>Jupiter</hi>
lurking under the soft Down of a
beautiful Swan. <hi>Jupiter</hi> is luxurious,
but 'tis the <hi>Ganymedean Iupiter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dew'd
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:35344:55"/>
with <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambrosia.</hi> The
Poets were not altogether deceived.
Our <hi>Loves</hi> and <hi>Amours,</hi> not those of
<hi>Jupiter,</hi> transform'd the Deity into
these conceited Disfigurements.</p>
            <p>But because volatile and wandering
Love is never at a stay till it come to
the top, or pleasingly discern'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
itself there arriv'd, when it is
always the companion of the chiefest
Good; or as if it were the chiefest, it
ought to acquiesce in this one thing,
and travel earnestly toward this, as
Souls covet Heaven, or Fire the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
He will have no leasure to tend
the Allurements of new Felicity, if
there be any such: He will not endure
to love another, nor so much as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
he will complain that he is below
his own desires, and so overmuch
wanting to that which fills and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with overmuch desire; and after
he has wholly set his minde upon one,
yet cannot finde he has done enough,
it remains that he must be cruel to all,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35344:55"/>
but <hi>Stoics</hi> and Monks. Hence Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> who invented a new
Tyranny, a third degree of Friendship.
Who could not endure to murder a
pair of Friends, but endeavoured to
separate them; and to intercept the
Fidelity which he had emulated, of a
Tyrant, being become a Rival. Tell
me, Tyrant, if thou cam'st a threefold
Lover to these Twins, which wouldst
thou first receive into thy Bosome? If
thou challengest the equal Embraces
of both: Suppose one of them to be
led to Death, which wouldst thou
choose, to dye with the one, or live
with the other? I finde thee at a loss,
like a piece of Iron between two Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones,
detain'd from both, upon the
confines of the two Elections. Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly
thou desir'st to live and dye both
at a time. Equality of Affection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muses
a Lover about to adhere to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
yet to both. The one expects
thy tears, the other would have thee
laugh. Toward the one over-faithful
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35344:56"/>
and officious, toward the other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious.
So that the Minde thus torn
in several pieces, like <hi>Metius,</hi> deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
merits the punishment of <hi>Metius</hi>
for its Perjury. Consider well Loves
Dominion, or his Submission (for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
these new <hi>Eteocle's</hi> and <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice's,</hi>
command and obey by turns)
there is in both somwhat singular, they
will not admit of two Masters. If
thou supposest <hi>Love</hi> to be a God, he
has but one Heaven. If Fire, Fire has
but one Sphere. If Death, the Gods
forbid us to expire often; and not
above once to deposite our Souls in
the bosome of another, having allow'd
us but once to live. If thou callest a
Lover the Representation, Coin, or
Seal of the Party beloved, which take
their form and price from the Image;
the Mirrour can be enliven'd but with
one Effigies at a time; the Coin is to
carry the Face but of one Lord or
Prince; the Seal closes up the Epistle
to all but one. But if in Friendship
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35344:56"/>
you look upon the Marriage of Souls,
it would be a great Crime to admit
Polygamy in male Amours; to wed
a new one, having married a former,
and commit Adultery with his Friend.</p>
            <p>Does this Affection then, which
has distinguish'd Humane Society from
the herding of Beasts, bring Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
again to <hi>Stoic</hi> Barbarism, which
is the contempt of all men? Must the
the rest of Mankinde be hated, to love
one? Heavens forbid. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more kinde, nothing more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne
than Friendship and Philosophy,
nothing more the support of the World
(except the Deity.) Minds already
soft, easie, and prone to Affability,
behave themselves without Severity or
Perversness to all others. They diffuse
their beams like <hi>Phoebus,</hi> who guilds
<hi>Rhodes</hi> with a more peculiar Light.
The party beloved is dedicated to the
Lover, no otherwise than a Book;
sent to one, but to be read by all.
We congratulate those candid Souls,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:35344:57"/>
who like the Gods, cherish with their
favourable Influence, not one person,
but all humane Kinde. Who like our
first Parents, look upon all Nations as
one Family; or as if their Minds were
equal to the extent of the Terrestrial
Globe, love all the World as their
native Country. But this we do not
call Friendship, but a certain Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence,
and uncertain <hi>Humanity.</hi>
Neither do we blame this, or receive
it with less candour, than what we
practise towards Enemies; but we
would restrain those luxurious and
Court-like Affections, that pride them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in number of Salutes, and bands
of Followers; that hunt after these
Ensignes as well of Grandeur as Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
sweating in the crouds of their
Retainers. But it is the humour of
your haughty Ladies, and suspected
for their Chastity, by a dissembled
Obsequiousness to lye in wait for the
Affections of others; merry toward
all, but kinde onely to one; to give
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:35344:57"/>
nods of distinction sometimes to one,
sometimes to another; to distribute
up and down their alluring Looks; to
scatter and divide their enticing Smiles;
lastly, as it were to swoon away; and
having caught the prey, to withdraw
both the bait and the allurement. A
most wicked sort of Pride, to number
the herds of Lovers among Female
Riches and the Revenues of Beauty.</p>
            <p>But because he cannot endure to
love less, and more he cannot love,
whoever is inflam'd to the highest
with a genuine fire; nor is it enough
for him to labour under a disgust of
others, unless he also loath himself;
denying the division of his flames as
well to himself, as to others; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he freezes within his own proper
Sphere, and in the midst of those fires
wherein he breaths, grows stark and
benumm'd, like the cold Salamander.
For that his Soul, being altogether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from, and forgetful of its self,
he fears all things in his Friends be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:35344:58"/>
in regard of himself, nothing,
but only lest he should fail in any part
of his duty. While he deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
he is wise for another, and submits
himself to Fate, or to a better Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianship,
the Providence of his Friend.
Who on the other side, alternatively
takes care of him, fears, and provides
against Danger. He like an assisting
Soul appoints him a Minde, that he
may seem to approach the regiment of
Heaven, which is govern'd by an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence:
Because, I say, whoever
adopts himself to another, abjures
himself, and as one deceased, delivers
himself up to Oblivion; and as it is
but reason, esteems him only dear, with
whom, as youngest born, he lives a
more lively Life, and like a pallid
Shade abides and sports about his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Whoever he were that was the
Doctor of Amours, he established for
an unjust measure of Affections, the
Love of himself; and idly proposed
our selves to our selves, as Exemplars
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35344:58"/>
of Loving. How little is every one
to himself? Who is he, not enslav'd
to his own Desires, or infected with
his own Customs, that lives less for
another, than for himself? Neither
does this Precept spring from our Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but from our Vertues, that we
should be assistant and serviceable to
others. Some Vertues are severe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Professour; and they serve
with us, that under others merit gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Stipends. That Modesty, which
dictates reproaches to its self, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors
all sorts of Scarlet but that of a
chast and humble Lip, obstinately
vaunts the Praises of another, and
translates the Honours due to its self.
Ambition that toyls under another
name, meets with the Titles of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor
and Fidelity. That Brass and
Iron which surrounds the breast, only
forms man into a shield for others;
that he may be able to endure the
blows, which he labours to ward from
others. No man dies in the defence
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:35344:59"/>
of himself, lest he should dye; but to
prevent the fate of Parents, Children,
or some other Friend. What have I
said, no man dyes? No man lives for
his own sake. If then so much Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry,
on this side Friendship, proceed
from bare Vertue and Nature it self,
certainly Friendship should not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
any other Law upon Good Will,
but only this, Not to know the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or to prefix other limits, than
what the Desires of Lovers designe.
Let no man love who governs his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
but will not be govern'd; who
loves cautiously according to rule, as
if he were about to hate. Some one
may love naturally; no man truely
loves, who answers his <hi>Lover</hi> according
to proportion, and as it were loves by
weight.</p>
            <p>Long Veneration keeps me in su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense,
as a confused Lover, that has
wasted his Sight with beholding a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Form, uncertain which part of
noble Beauty first to admire. Yet has
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:35344:59"/>
he made such a progress, as to admire
his own amazement, and to give the
chief honour to every particular Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and to assent to all, though
praising distinct parts, and various in
their judgments. I hear <hi>Dionysius</hi>
defining <hi>Love</hi> to be a Circle returning
from Good, through Good, to Good
again. Hence I acknowledge Rings to
be not only Pledges, but the <hi>Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks</hi>
of <hi>Love.</hi> This Circle seems
to be expressed by the perpetual heat
of <hi>Lovers,</hi> that whirls round with the
Blood like an Orbicular motion; such
is that Ethereal fire, where the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
flame both feeds and satisfies
it self. Who loves what he has loved,
moves Spherically in his own foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps:
And he that loves only that he
may love, revolves to himself, and
there meets himself, and closes the
Circle.</p>
            <p>I hear <hi>Aristophanes,</hi> and readily
assent, who affirms, that the main My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of <hi>Love,</hi> is to be reduced to the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:35344:60"/>
same from whence we were. For we
see in Natural Motion, how all things
run back to their first Principles. By
the Law of Nature we wholly employ
the Faculties of our Souls in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of those from whom we received
'em; and by a certain series of Piety,
and gradation of Affinity, we reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
those names of <hi>Country, Parents,
God,</hi> as more dear than our Lives. I
know not whether I may call a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lover
blinde and incestuous, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
and holy, who is always deeply
in love with something of his Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
and therefore prosecutes his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
with a pious flame. Neither is
he much out of the way, who takes
for his Parent the person from whom
he gains a new lot of Life; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
his Nativity at the noble price
of his Piety. But you, O <hi>Thales,</hi> and
you, O <hi>Empedocles,</hi> the one leaping
into the Water, the other into the Fire;
the one by chance, the other advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly;
both of ye made too much
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35344:60"/>
haste to dissolve not only Philosophy,
but the Philosophers themselves into
their first Principles, and to plunge
the vital Particles of Souls in their first
Elements. Yet thus the Errours of
Philosophers excuse the Errours of the
Affections; and while famish'd Souls,
like famish'd Bodies, are nourish'd
with those things of which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
you would swear that the liquid
Soul were infus'd into great Drinkers,
the bloody Soul into Tyrants. You
would say that sordid people were
newly come out of the mud; that the
barbarous <hi>Stoicks</hi> were only the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of men, hewn out of the cold
Stone. If we suppose that familiar
and well-acquainted Souls are sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
into the world, not without a
divorce from the common Seminary
of Souls, or the conjoyn'd Mansion of
formerly Double-bodied Man; we
finde this in some measure to be true,
by the eager endeavours of the Parts
of dissected Worms to meet together
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:35344:61"/>
again; as also by this, that we see some
persons at first sight, rushing into each
others Embraces, as if they had remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd
their former Fellowship. How
did the <hi>Platonic</hi> transmigrate all into
Memory, when he taught<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that to Love
and Philosophize was but to remember!</p>
            <p>Indeed, to him who believes that to
Love is the same thing as to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize,
this is no more than to excite
those Souls slid down from Heaven,
together with their Bodies, to a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Contemplation of Heaven, and to
breathe with a continual desire of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
This is that, I know not what
Ardour, which begetting in Mortals,
always in Emulation with the Gods,
both a loathing of their condition, and
means to remedy it; hastens to put off
the most frail part of man. Hence
furnish'd with many eyes, what the
Sun cannot do, we behold both ends
of the Earth at one time. Hence it
was that <hi>Amphitryo</hi> could look after
his House and his Camp at once. Hence
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35344:61"/>
it is, that without any limit of time
or space, we live a posthumous Life,
either by our Friends the Guardians of
our transmitted Souls, or our Children,
Heirs of our transmitted Lives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> prevents the wonderer at
these things, with a nearer Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
for this same <hi>Platonic</hi> affirms,
that this same <hi>Cupid</hi> is a desire of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying
and forming Beauty in a fair
Object. Fain, indeed, we would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
not with a fruitless delight always
woe and contemplate, that by an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Splendour, as by the meeting
of a Star in Conjunction, the Influence
may be the greater, and that so the
Star may become a Constellation.
Therefore as Pictures, so the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of extraordinary Majesty, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
beyond our humane condition,
affect the Beholders with a certain
pleasure, but with no desire. And
that same portion of Beauty, which
recreates the Eyes with that same deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of Symmetry and Colour, after
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35344:62"/>
death shall meet with more Spectators
than Lovers. Nothing wither'd, or
dead, can move living Affections;
neither is the pleasure of enjoying,
greater than that of forming pleasure.
Lust is from Nature, which indulges
this Art as well to the Minde as to the
Countenance, that where e're it should
fix its sight, it might expunge it self.
Therefore all Beauty loves a Mirrour;
and lest there should want a Spectator,
seeks its self, beholding its own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion.
I call thee to witness, noble
<hi>Socrates,</hi> the Master both of Love and
Sanctity; who dost the same as a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher,
which the Statuary did
before, both shape and polish men;
though the price not only of the Art,
but of the matter, must be enhaunsed.
For which reason it was thy Custome
to enrol in thy Schools, as in a Nursery
of Women, such beautiful Auditors,
as <hi>Phaedrus</hi> and <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> who might
easily imbibe thy Soul, and render
thy reflexion more fair: as being more
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:35344:62"/>
smooth than all the Mirrours in the
world, and more apt to take an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
than wax it self. Something
there is, whatever it is, which with a
Celestial brightness, like that of the
Stars, surpasses humane Envy; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures
Adoration, and ravishes Love to
itsself with a specious enticement; and
so certainly, so entirely possesses us,
that it will not suffer us to turn our
sight upon any other Object. Nothing
but what is adorn'd with such beams
as these, nothing but what thus
draws and smites the Eyes, can dazle
and inflame our Mindes. Even our
very Vertues flatter us under the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shape of Vertue. And as often as
we are minded to erre with Nature,
as often as we seek among Monsters for
something to be adopted into the
number of Angels, as well as into
humane Society; this in them appears
pleasant and delightful, that they fear
no Rival, and serve to shew the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous
pleasure of Nature in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:35344:63"/>
Unless any one will deny,
that there is any thing deformed in
Nature; since those Animals, which
the Grand Artificer has condemn'd to
darkness, retain a certain Beauty in
ugliness; and like Warts and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
set off the rest of the worlds
face. For that which less flatters the
sight, is not therefore ugly to the
Eye; but may be accompted a rarity,
not frequently seen; which the nicer
sort are wont to purchase at any rate.
What may not be accompted sacred,
when Owls and the most ill-favour'd
Creatures have found Adorers? Where
since there is no Deformity, nothing of
Hatred remains; neither is the name
of <hi>Antipathy</hi> admitted, but among
the Sects of Philosophers. Wherefore
dost thou tell me, among the Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Sobriety, how the <hi>Colewort</hi>
shuns the <hi>Vine?</hi> Sober, not out of
a loathing of Wine, or love of Sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,
but for thy healths sake. Thus
the Wolf devours the Lamb, Fire
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:35344:63"/>
feeds upon Water, not out of Hatred,
but for Self-preservation. Thus Man
abhors not Man, but Inhumanity; and
therefore guards himself. Thus we do
not envy others their Riches, as offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at 'em, but over-unjustly solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
for our selves. If there be any
Strife of Nature, certainly the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
is very favourable, and such
as founds and raises Common-wealths;
as sociable Thievery, which lays the
foundations of its Greatness upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Losses; neither can we call these
Spoils, but Gifts, by a reciprocal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.
Severe Love! If these Wars
must be carried on with thy Weapons;
if <hi>Helena</hi> must be always purchas'd by
Rapine and Bloodshed, and <hi>Venus</hi> be
only granted to <hi>Mars?</hi> Nevertheless,
of so great moment it is for us to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,
that we may please him. Nor
do I wonder, when Beauty sets the
Gods at odds, if miserable <hi>Paris,</hi> and
the rest of Mortals, prove such vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Rivals in the same case. Hence
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:35344:64"/>
it was that <hi>Love,</hi> the Parent of all
the world, form'd Harmony out of
Discord, and coupled <hi>Vulcan</hi> to <hi>Venus,</hi>
that is to say, Fire to Water; and
made an intertexture of the most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing
things in Nature. And when
he had fram'd and adorn'd the vast
bulk of the Universe, for a more than
ordinary Shew, He was the first Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
of his own work; and first felt
the force of that Beauty, which He
himself infus'd. This is that Order,
from whence things borrow not their
Softness, but their Strength and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
together. Beauty seems to me to
be nothing else but the Consummation,
Flower, and Maturity of every thing.
That I take to be beautiful and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did,
which is entirely what it ought
to be. The innate Vigour gives
Strength and Figure to the Sinews:
how the half-concocted Gem sparkles
in the unpolish'd mass! and how the
inward juice not only fructifies, but
adorns with an Emral-greenness!
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:35344:64"/>
Thus we finde a Minde composed
within, polishes the outward Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
honest Thoughts, and a Minde
incontaminated, adorn the cheeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
all the Fucus in the world. The
Minde appears through its natural Veil,
like the Sun through a Cloud. This is
that brightness of an undefiled Minde,
that addes a lustre to the members, that
by the vertue of Similitude they may
be capable to allure Souls to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
till we come to understand
this Original Form, to take a nearer
view of this Deity: and then we
finde the small value of this Image of
Clay. For what are those Features
of the Face, that busie our Eyes with
viewing new Graces, springing every
Day? Which we shew one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
calling auxiliary Worshippers to
aid our praises, though so jealous of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals?
Nothing but a Superficies, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but meer Colour, a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
of Lights, a most thin Shadow;
which if we long admire, fades and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:35344:65"/>
vanishes while we behold it. What is
that bulk and structure of Sinews,
built as it were by Rule and Compass?
Alas! Statues boast a finer skin than
men; and the Palace shews us a more
noble Building, than the Master him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
What is that, which is the
chiefest grace of our Bodies, which
no painting can imitate, I mean <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
Were it more soft and equal
than that of the Spheres or Time it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
it has only this to patronize its
vanity; that while it pleases, lest it
should grow irksome, it passes away,
and ceases assoon as it begins. But I
seem more than I ought to favour the
Errours of Lovers, and the <hi>Encomiums</hi>
of Beauty, who believe all that is
thought beautiful in Bodies, to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the shadows of Beauty, than the
ravings of Imagination, or the false
colouring of Opinion. Every where
we love that which we suppose to
our selves, not what we see. Tell
me whence it comes to pass, that the
same face which to one seems brighter
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:35344:65"/>
than the Stars, another meets with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
Tell me, why some are allured by
the fallacious Softness and Delicacy of
the Female Sex? Why Women are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
with a manly Fierceness, or,
which is more, a careless and stern
countenance of Terrour? Why the little
and Diminutive are admired by some;
Why to others the tall Proportion, which
fills the Eye, appears most Majestick.</p>
            <p>I will tell you freely how the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
stands. Whatever Figure it be
that feeds the eyes, is either imaginary,
and of that kinde, that we loose it,
when we cease fondly to dream; or if
it be true, unworthy to detain the
Soul; but only it stirs it up, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
it, and sends it otherwhere.
What ardour of minde can remain in
that, which only the Eye enjoys, and
which it knows not how to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate?
For no man whatsoever, the
Beauty of the Minde excepted, could
ever believe himself to be made beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
by the view of Handsomness, by
a kinde of Contagion. That which
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:35344:66"/>
abides beneath the Soul, ought certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be akin to the Divinity, that is,
incorporeal; much more would we
have it be belov'd: though that grace
of Body, how little soever it be, is
without a bulk, and like our Soul, is
seen to reign and wander thorough e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
part. There is manifestly to be
discern'd a flux and splendour of the
Soul, or of the <hi>Idea,</hi> which inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing
itself in the last operation, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses
itself through all the Arteries,
and forming all things to its own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
translates an assembled collection
of Graces into the Cheeks and Eyes, as
to the Center.</p>
            <p>Here the Boy <hi>Cupid</hi> has his Throne
erected, who cheats the Beholders,
and brandishes his enliven'd flames,
having besmear'd his Arrows with the
wanton Tapers kindled by the Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of his Mothers Eyes. Here Love
sports away his youthful days; but
when he comes to riper years, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
both his abode and his Arrows.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:35344:66"/>
First possessing a middle Dominion,
between the Minde and the Body, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the confines of both, he innocently
deceives the sight: but by and by he
takes his flight into the Minde, where
he makes use of a pure and Starrie
Flame; or else he descends to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and like a Meteor, deludes it with
an impure and drossie splendour. Not
to use many Arguments, this one thing
will condemn the unhappiness of that
Affection, for that it more frequently
seizes the absent, than those that are
present; and that sight and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enforces them either to a Loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or to Madness. What Deity thus
afflicts the Madness of misguided <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid?</hi>
Who compells him to desire
that, which he most amply enjoys; and
what he most eagerly panted after,
nauseously to refuse: and sooner to
loath himself, than to be satisfied with
what he desired? He confesses, that he
sought not these delights, but that
being ignorant what he should desire,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:35344:67"/>
through the force of a blinde Passion,
he fell by accident upon these things.
But because these are only the shadows
of the thing which the Minde hungers
after, it flies greedily to them, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
Birds to painted Grapes, though
those painted Junkets prove rather its
torment than its food. Nevertheless,
I acknowledge that these shadows of
Beauty will beget the shadows of Love.
And as in the Soul we reverence the
likeness of God, so in the Body we
admire a certain shadow, in both a
Deity in similitude, and become the
woers of Divinity. For the Minde
looks up toward God, as the Eye to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Sun: From whose Light it
obtains this peculiar, that it sees, that
there is nothing else available to be
seen, nor that it can behold any thing
else, beyond the sight of that Object;
the full lustre of whose beams how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we are not able to behold: For
which reason we rather chuse to fix
our Eyes upon the refracted Beams,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:35344:67"/>
and clouded splendour, to refresh our
selves with shadows and faint delights.
Whatever it be, whether a ray of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
a reflexion of the <hi>Idea,</hi> or an
efflux of the Soul, that takes our Eyes
and Mindes captive under the Notion
of Beauty, it must be something divine,
it being only proper to Man to covet
and contemplate Beauty.</p>
            <p>And here I cannot but take notice
of those <hi>Spectrums</hi> of supercilious Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
who under a form of Sanctity take
upon 'em to be pleas'd with nothing;
who condemn all acts of Humanity, as
the extravagancies of solid Kindness
tending to Luxury; who would make
this God <hi>Cupid,</hi> the Contriver of Lust
and immoderate Desires, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of all manner of Tragick Crimes
and Impieties; whom we finde to be
the Match-maker of Immortality, and
the Author of Divinity. Herein Love
exceeds effeminate Luxury, that where
there is no return of thanks, there is
the same profit in Love and Liberality;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35344:68"/>
it has its reward in its self. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
enough to have well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd.
But there is that sought for,
which is of greater value than all this,
to be retaliated with equal love; where
Souls equally heated, intermix their
awaken'd flames and light by a mutual
collision, in the same manner as Iron
is sharpen'd by Iron; and foster each
other by reciprocal generation; while
the Reflexions of two harmonious
Hearts answer each to other, like Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in a Chrystal Fountain. Certainly
there is nothing more pleasing than to
love or be belov'd, unless it be to love
and be belov'd both at one time.</p>
            <p>For where we love unfortunately,
and that Animals are espous'd to our
Embraces, as where <hi>Zerxes</hi> was joyn'd
as it were in solemn Matrimony to
<hi>Plato, Polydorus</hi> to a Statue, <hi>Lesbia</hi>
to a Statue, whereby they did not so
much desire as undergo a change, and
experiment in themselves the Fables of
the Poets, finding themselves as it were
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35344:68"/>
changed into Trees, Stones and Birds;
it is not our meanest Felicity to feign
Discourses, Answers, and frame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
to our selves, as if we intended
to be happy at our own, not at the Will
of another. It pleases us to enjoy an
Affection, not in vain returning to the
Author; where there is that of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
still remaining, which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
the chiefest in Love; that we
love our Love reciprocally, and like
the Sun, enjoy the reflexion of our
own heat.</p>
            <p>Nor does that other chance of <hi>being
Belov'd,</hi> afford less Delight; but more
of Honour. Whence men more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensively
court the Affections of others,
than they expend their own. This is
without the Ensignes of Magistracy or
the Scepter, to extend the proper
Kingdom of the Gods in the Minds of
Men. This shews us vast Felicities and
Vertues, and causes us rather to suffer,
than render good Offices. Hence are
reckoned so many Trophies of thy
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:35344:69"/>
Vertues, as we finde Retainers follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thy Triumphal Chariot.</p>
            <p>But when the Contest is, who shall
render most good Offices; when it is
a Combat of Kindness, not after the
fashion of the Court, but with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
shame to submit, and out of a fear
of less well-doing, then is that parity
of reciprocal Kindness, which <hi>Aristotle</hi>
dignified with the known Title of
Friendship, though giving no Example.
Well fare that Equality which Justice,
with her Sword and her Ballance, has
been long attempting, but Love has
easily brought into Custome among
Mankinde. Sometimes it happens that
the distance of Fortunes or Merits se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates
Friendship. <hi>Jupiter</hi> must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
to Earth, and put off his Deity,
before he can enjoy the Embraces of
Mortals; Nay, the brute Deity must
descend below man, and work his
admittance rather by Contempt than
Terrour. <hi>Semele</hi> has sufficiently taught
us, how great a punishment it is to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:35344:69"/>
admit a Deity to her Bed. The ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of great people, is only sweet
to the ignorant, as approaching nearer
to Flattery, than Charity. 'Tis our
Ambition, not our Friendship, advises
us to this, to purchase our selves into
the number of Servants, rather than of
Friends. But they are both equal,
who have captivated each other at the
expence of true worth. Sometimes
we experiment a more fragrant Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
while humble Masters strive to
love themselves, and chuse rather to
suffer a contempt of Dignity, than a
decrease of Candor. <hi>Alexander</hi> puts
off the Emperour, and by Loving,
looses what he won by Conquest; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that <hi>Ephestio</hi> should reign, upon
condition he may be a part of his
Kingdom. He bestows upon <hi>Ephestio</hi>
the Flatteries which he receives from
others; while he serves <hi>Ephestio,</hi> he
seems to enjoy more than another
World. We all confess that Love is a
soothing and restless desire of pleasing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:35344:70"/>
them who please us, either by chance,
or through their own vertue, or our
mistake. It little imports either to
Life or Friendship, where the heat
first kindled. The Heart moves and
throbs never the less for that, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
reverberating our breasts; and
like a double-diligent Importunate,
either to tire or force, to deserve or
asswage, cherishes Kindnesses with
Kindnesses; and where there is no
place for kinde Offices, like one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
rendring something, obliges the
Inclinations of the other with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of diligent Obsequiousness,
and strives to please with a fear of
displeasing. But this he accounts a
benefit, to have sometimes displeas'd;
by which means he may either hate or
reform his own proceedings. For to
be most like to this person, is to be
both good and happy: he dives into
the most inward Motions of the heart;
performs commands by conjecture,
and fulfils them as yet unknown to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:35344:70"/>
the Master, before the pangs of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
desire can come to torment
him. Neither shall he ever satisfie
himself, though the other has done
sufficient: whereby it is apparent, that
he who is the Courter, is delighted
with those Offices of Kindness, not so
much to gain favour, as out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to serve; as if Man were a Slave,
born by nature for that one Mistress.</p>
            <p>For you must know, that there is
the same pedigree and original of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
as of Living. Of some certain
things there is an order and mutual
agreement among themselves, either
instituted by Nature, or voluntarily
undertaken: of things like or dislike,
whereby those are conjoyn'd, those
are disunited and parted asunder. But
that tye of Blood is the work of
chance, nor does it shew any merit
of Affection, as being engrafted in
our Breasts, we never admit, but
ignorantly suffer; and now so much
as it brings of Necessity, so much it
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:35344:71"/>
imposes of Burthen. Pardon me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
if I hold the name of Friends
more holy than that of Parents. We
owe all that to Love, which we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to our Parents; that is, to be led
by the Errour of easie Piety. For out
of their mutual Love, not out of any
Charity to us, it happens that we
come to receive the benefit of this
light. Neither does proper Alliance
inflame or cherish Domestic Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
but Familiarity, and that same
sweet Society in Calamities, and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
Kindness in common Miseries.
I am deceiv'd, or Lovers are joyn'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
by a more strict alliance, and
by a tye so much the straiter, by how
much Reason is above Nature. The
force of a mans own Will is greater
than that of Consanguinity. For every
one obeys himself the more stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by how much he does it with more
pleasure, and submits to his own Laws.
But both these conspiring together,
how promptly and placidly does this
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:35344:71"/>
Affection sway the Minde, by a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
consent confederating our Will
with Nature?</p>
            <p>But O thou least of all the Gods,
though greatest of all the Deities, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Cupid!</hi> It is beneath thy Merits,
that the audacious Philosophers and
Poets should only feign thee a God.
However, thou hast this proper to a
Deity, to be unknown, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
sacred reproaches from men. He
has also this farther property of a God,
to lead men by a tacite Influence, so
that they obey, though they feel not
his Motions; and to draw others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
their Wills: insomuch that all
Affections contrary to it, at the beck
of his Majesty submit their Services.
While he is pleased to jeast, the lofty
hang their drooping heads: the brave
and stout fear and tremble at the glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
Darts of splendid eyes. The
Illiterate Heir of a sudden grows elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent;
he no longer buys his Love-Songs,
but grows enraged himself, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:35344:72"/>
sings her praise. To omit the other
Attributes of his Divinity, Love is a
Circle eternal, immense, in whom re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
those acts of Providence, to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern</hi>
and <hi>Cherish:</hi> wherein I am the
more confirm'd, for that <hi>Love</hi>'s Religion
strikes an awe upon the very wicked.
They court in such a manner, as if
they were performing Divine Service:
Their Countenances fail, they view
their Garments, and compose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to all the habits of Reverence.
To what intent? That they may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
their Mistrisses, as so many
Altars: Nay, they strive to be decently
absent: For whatever we love, we
believe to be every where present.
She is the Arbitatrix of our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings,
the Assistant both of our
Vertue and Wit; the lucky Guide of
all our Enterprizes; from whom he
that goes a Voyage begs fair Weather,
the Travailer safe Return, the Souldier
Victory, and all from her to whom he
has devoted the Spoils of his Enemies.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:35344:72"/>
Henceforward let it be lawful for <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
to salute each other with names
borrow'd from Heaven, and reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to sooth one another with those
Titles, under which they are wont to
worship the Immortal Gods.</p>
            <p>Neither is there any one who has
any reason to envy this Deity, who is
so easily pleased without slaughter and
bloodshed; who requires not the fat
of beasts, but faithful Adorers for his
Victims; and that he may not want
Temples, erects Altars, and kindles
Fires in humane breasts, while the God
himself converted into fire, seems to
take care of his own worship. And
thus it is, when a Lover sends forth
the sighs of Grief, it seems to me like
a certain kinde of Lightning breaking
from a Cloud, with a rumbling Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that afterwards vanishes into
smoak. While he sweats Tears and
boyls his Complaints, I then think
upon the burning of <hi>Aetna,</hi> and <hi>Vesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi>
vomiting flames in the midst of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:35344:73"/>
Snow and clouds of Ashes. When
burning with a short ardour, feigned
Love sells it self to counterfeit flames,
I acknowledge those fictitious Tapers,
and vain Meteors, like the wandering
Lights of the middle Region. What
though Fire serve only for humane
Use, and for the worship of the Gods?
What though it not only enlighten,
but heat out Wits, so that <hi>Bacchus</hi> and
<hi>Apollo</hi> may be truely said to derive
their Birth from the flames of Love?
What though it rage, where it findes
Obstacles in the way, and be nourish'd
with Injuries and Offences as with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
All this does but shew the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties
of the Ethereal Fire, which
burns and refreshes; which being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,
satisfies itself, and needs no
fuel. For Love, contented with it
self, is the price of its self; that being
immaculate and inviolable, it expiates
and takes away the Crimes which it
does not admit, and maintains the
Virgin Honours of the Vestal Flame.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:35344:73"/>
Lastly, This farther property has the
Celestial Fire, that as the uppermost
Element, it encompasses the vast Orb
for the safeguard of the world. Thus
the fire of Love possesses the supremest
Creatures, and preserves and closes all
the other Affections. In this only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
that it descends below its Sphere to
cherish and foster all the meaner sort of
Creatures with vital Heat. Thus is <hi>Love</hi>
made equal to those two most pure and
powerful Beings, God and Fire.</p>
            <p>But that which is number'd among
the Miracles of Love, astonishes us
much more; while we feel a burning
Fever creeping up and down, and
burning in the midst of our Bowels,
and yet nothing appears; so that while
we feel this Subterraneal Heat, yet
cannot tell from whence it arises, we
deny that we burn. We admire
whence it comes to pass, that the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres
of the Heart, like the strings of
two Lutes, so Harmoniously answer
one another. To this, like the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:35344:74"/>
Musician, we stand mute, and cry,
that those Fibres and Strings were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
extracted out of the same En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails.
We grant this Maxime to the
Physicians, That Motion is a certain
consent in Bodies; finding the same
thing to be true in Minds.</p>
            <p>Nor let us torment our selves with
doubting, but confidently aver with
<hi>Plato,</hi> that Love is <hi>a Magician.</hi> Whence
comes it to pass, that Souls by a secret
contact conceive the Seeds and first
Flames of Desire? Whence comes it
to pass, that Lovers, like Sorceresses,
burn and melt away, by the means of
Images and little Figures, the Bowels
of wasting men? Whence comes it to
pass, that beautiful Eyes, like those of
Basilisks, bewitch the Sight, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing
beams with beams, knit those
Knots, and frame those Chains that
binde and fetter the Beholders? What
may I call other than these, those soft
Charms by which <hi>Endymion</hi> call'd
down the Moon from Heaven? What
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:35344:74"/>
are all those alluring Sobs other than
Magic Murmurs, and the Philters of
Discourse? What are Presents other
than Charms, which infuse a pleasing
Poyson into those that wear them?
I know not whether to admire the
forcible Attracts in her that is Beloved,
or the vanquishing Arguments of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequiousness
in a Lover; those Incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
against which there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
as against Sorcery, either by
way of Curse or Exorcism. Certainly
all the whole force of Magic is seated
in Love, of which this is said to be one
Miracle, mutually to attract and change
things by a certain commutation of
Nature; For that the Members of this
world, like the Arteries of some great
Animal, depending upon the same
communion of Nature, are coupled
together by a Spirit, that throws it
self into the whole Body. By reason
of this binding and commerce of things,
it secretly comes to pass, that Love by
a mutual Attraction of Souls, like a
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:35344:75"/>
Disease contracted by Contagion, seizes
chiefly upon the sound, yet by and by
willing to submit to the pleasing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper;
while the Captive more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
bindes himself, than findes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
bound in these soft Chains and
silken Fetters, and like the Chain it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
is ignorant of the embraces which
he enjoys.</p>
            <p>Methinks I seem rather to suffer than
describe the passionate and violent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of Lovers, and to act my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
before I have finish'd it. Before,
being gently deluded with Dreams
and Apparations, I rather underwent,
than described the alternative Fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a Madness newly enrag'd. But
so soon as the lovely Countenance of
my Mistress had infected my Blood, not
with the rude Image, but with the
shadow of the Image; so soon as it
has signed my very Soul, and imprinted
its indelible Characters, and possess'd
the entire man, no otherwise in my
sick Breast, than beneath the toss'd
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:35344:75"/>
and troubled waves; an incertain
species and shadow, wither'd and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
which flies the Approacher, and
vanishes from my Embraces. Streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
removing gently <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Vail, no
sooner does the divine Form of tasted
Felicity shew it self, but a troublesom
Ignorance begat a care in me of seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into particulars, what Disposition,
what Endowments, what Family, what
Pedigree. For this is the first and last
of Lovers cares and joys, not only to
call to remembrance their former
Sports, and rudiments of their Amours;
but also to enquire into the years and
worth of the Parents, and to discourse
from what noble beginnings their
Friendship took its rise.</p>
            <p>Whither does this first Violence, not
only of Nature, but of Reason carry
us! Voluntarily deceived, we not only
adore Vertue itself, but whatever car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with it the outside and appearance
of Vertue. Sometimes that difficulty,
which guards the path of Vertue with
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:35344:76"/>
a sacred Horrour, and drives away the
prophane Vulgar, repels, and yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures
with flatterng Injuries. We more
greedily suck the Honey that lies hid
among the Stings. Thus it is a kinde
of Spur and Encitement to our future
Pleasure, to wait at the threshold of a
Mistriss, to suffer a repulse from a more
unworthy Rival; and undergo indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnities,
which cause him to tear his
Hair and bite his Lips.</p>
            <p>Note also, that those are the Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Lovers, which among the
shadows of the Vertues are accounted
the chiefest. Praises wherewith, as
with Incense, the Gods and Men are
pacified; how easily they obtain this
property, that while we endeavour to
please others, we please our selves!
By what precious Allurements they
enable us to please the most chast of
Matrons; who denying to be belov'd,
yet covet to seem amiable. Both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregious
Arguments of Vertue. But
there is more of certainty in praising
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:35344:76"/>
than being prais'd. For the undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
are wont to be most praised, and
most desire it, as the deformed covet
Fucus's. But no man can truely praise,
but he that is praise-worthy himself.
The same thing does he, or at least
would do, that seeks renown by other
mens deeds; as he that erects a Statue
to himself, erects a Monument of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
For this is not to exercise, but
to admire and worship Vertue, as a
high desert. These are the Darts of
<hi>Cupid</hi> feather'd with his own Wings,
which while they gently seem to stroke,
wound more severely.</p>
            <p>We are so much men of Glory, and
creatures of Vertue, that I am doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
whether I ought to confess, that
among the Vertues, we diligently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
those which are profitable; that
is, which exercise and invite Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
as Modesty and Equity; or those
which govern and preserve Humanity,
as Fortitude and Munificence. But as
Emulation is to the rest of the Vertues,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:35344:77"/>
so Munificence knits our Affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Though his Merit is accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
greatest, by how much there is
the less of Desert in the receiver. For
all which we ought to be beholding
to Favour, and not to Judgment, which
for our sake would cast Contumely
upon the Well-doer. To this Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
thus awaken'd, that Liberality
answers which is bred in the breast of
every one. And though perhaps at
first it had an unjust esteem of the
Donor, because of the Benefits; yet
by and by it loves the Gifts for the
Authors sake, who extended that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent
minde of Houshold-gods and
Parents, beyond the verge of his own
Family, and with a nursing Piety re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
Strangers into his bosome, and
fosters as her Relations. Here van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish'd
Gratitude submits, and being
sensible that nothing can be return'd,
unless the man himself, he retaliates
the Patroness, like a Goddess, with a
faithful Worshipper. Neither does
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:35344:77"/>
that seem to me to be an ingenuous
Ardour, which returns Benefits as it
were Debts, and repays Gifts as if to
quit Scores. He acts not piously but
proudly, who unwillingly suffers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be overcome. This is, to refuse,
to stop, and not to receive: this is with
greater Pride than Gratitude, to boast
particular Wealth, and a wonderful
strife of Munificence. But in regard
that Benefits seek nothing more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
reception, he only knows to
exercise Liberality in receiving, who
candidly interprets, and returns no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a grateful Minde. Neither
does he believe this to be the price of
his own, but the pledge of another
mans Liberality. These Benefits are
the Darts of <hi>Cupid,</hi> which with a
Golden Shaft inflict a faithful, but a
splendid wound. <hi>Jupiter</hi> courts more
powerfully in the shape of Gold, than
under his gaudy Feathers, or in his
own divine Form. For the Idioms
of Presents are understood by all; but
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:35344:78"/>
the Characters of Majesty and Dignity,
and the perswasions of a Rhetorical
Pen, are discernible to few.</p>
            <p>May not I affirm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that from this
Humanity of a facile Minde, proceeds
that Commiseration, which softens the
Breast like Wax, and causes it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any impression? May I not say,
that from this amplitude of Minde, that
proud Benignity springs, which while
it seeks the place of Munificence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
loves the miserable, and loathes
the fortunate? May I not believe that
hence proceeds that generous Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness,
which shews more Kindness to
bended Knees and downcast Looks,
than the Embraces of the Happy; and
loves with that magnificent condition,
not to be belov'd again?</p>
            <p>And here we must confess the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
Amours which are darted from
the whole body, where Vertue shews
it self; where Candor of Minde tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
the Blood with Milk; where a
liberal Countenance as it were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:35344:78"/>
the Beholders; and the glances
of the Eyes are gather'd like scatter'd
Coyns; where thou maist observe the
dictates of a prudent Lip, and draw
from thence certain tacite consultations
of Wisdom; where you may observe
reduc'd to a certain Law, by the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance
of Justice, the strength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of our Arteries, as well as of our
Inclinations; and maist as it were han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with thine eyes the enliven'd System
of <hi>Ethics;</hi> where when thou hast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
the transparent Members, like
Gems fix'd to the members for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as well as Service, then beholding
the rammass'd strength of Beauty, thou
shalt cry out, Here, <hi>Vulcan,</hi> here;
come bring away thy Nets, we have
once more here taken <hi>Mars</hi> in Copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
with <hi>Venus.</hi> O most admirable
Form! worthy the Empire of more
than one Sphere. We give thanks to
<hi>Jupiter,</hi> that he hath not envy'd so
much Beauty to the world. The sight
of this Form, more powerful than <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi>'s
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:35344:79"/>
Lyre, is sufficient to tame wilde
Beasts and Philosophers. This Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,
more pleasant than the Light it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
deserves, instead of <hi>Phoebus</hi> Rays,
not only to try the births of Eagles,
but of Men: One would swear that
Souls, like falling Stars, had flow'd
from Heaven, while we admire the
glittering Splendour of Beauty. These
are the Darts of <hi>Cupid,</hi> tipt with the
Light of Eyes brandishing flames, that
sparkling burn and prick.</p>
            <p>Thus whatsoever is conspicuous, and
to which we would be like, that
snatches us to it self with the same ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
with which we draw those
things to our selves, to which we seem
to be like. We give and ask pardon
of this Madness, through which, as
Men, we act as Boys, and covet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations
of our Looking-glasses
to kiss and embrace. 'Tis not the
Fate of one <hi>Narcissus,</hi> but of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
to be in love with their own
Shadows. This Covetousness is to be
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:35344:79"/>
indulg'd us, whereby we feed upon
our like; it being the Law of Mindes
to be nourish'd with their like. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I do not so much admire the force
of Custome, which reconciles us not
only to Bodies, but to Places them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and inanimate trifles. Thus Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity,
without which, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
we are but Pilgrims, gives this
efficacy to Custome, to form natural
and proper Manners, and to fit the
Minde to the Minde, that we may
converse more sweetly and freely with
another, than with our selves. 'Tis
a Hell upon earth, not a Society, for
fear of displeasing, to set our faces in
the Looking-glass, in respect to the
Visit; to weigh our words like Gold,
before we speak 'em; and to be put
to behave our selves, as at a publick
Assembly, with premeditated Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures.</p>
            <p>But why do I recount those agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
species, slightly painted in our
Minds, either by Art, or Nature, or
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:35344:80"/>
by Custome? When <hi>Love</hi> has fix'd a
living Image in our breasts of all these
things, by whose power they move
and act. It was well provided for
<hi>Lovers,</hi> that it is lawful to Love the
unwilling. There is no need of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
returns and the debt of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
If it move nothing that thou
art her Image and her Slave, that thou
hast lost thy Life and Liberty for her
sake; if the Crime of Impiety and
Homicide terrifie nothing; yet neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of Nature kindles Love out of
Love, and Flame out of Flame. Yet
Nature would not indulge that power
to love, to dissemble, or otherwise to
burn, than as a painted fire. For let
the Countenance or Gestures counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
never so much, Dissimulation will
betray it self, either out of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>studious
emulation of imitating, or by
reason of its own sloath. If yet thou
wilt not acknowledge Love to be the
price of Man, that thou maist admit
him under the notion of Profit, know
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:35344:80"/>
that he comprehends in himself all the
benefits which he does, or is able to
do, and all above our wishes; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whom I would attribute the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
themselves to Chance and Fate,
not to Man; and shall account them
rather as things found, than accepted.
By vertue of which Gift, the Poor is
Liberal, while he gives nothing, but
liberally wishes. Than which, the
Gods neither ask, nor bestow any thing
greater upon Mortals. Surely the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Philter is this, beyond all the
power of Herbs and Flowers; <hi>Love,
if thou wilt be beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as it is an uncomely thing to
ask or give a reason of Love, so is that
Love most worthy which springs, like
some Flowers, without the help of seed;
and has this property of Eternity, to
exist without a Cause; and like the
Heavens, to be mov'd by an unseen In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence.
This is that which we
acknowledge to be all <hi>Love</hi> by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
That Similitude, which partly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:35344:81"/>
manifest, but chiefly occult, which
we call Sympathy. From whence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Propinquity or Custome the near
and familiar Soul adheres to the Soul,
as plain Bodies adhere to plain Bodies,
only by the glew of Aptitude, never
to be separated. Nature seems to
produce Twin-like Minds, as to assigne
companions for Minds, like Shades
and Genius's to Bodies. Hence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Wills of their Nativities,
Men undergo the same Fates, and are
born Twins. Most happy pair of
Lovers! more noble sight than that
of the Gladiators, where the whole
strife in the duel of Liberality is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on by good Offices. In this one
thing disagreeing Passions shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
while both sollicitous for one
another, exercise their Hatred and
their Fears; both, endued with each
others Choler, discern and judge the
same things, the one as the other;
both touch'd with the same Magnet,
turn themselves the same way, tend
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:35344:81"/>
and close the same way. The one
puts on the Countenance of the other,
and represents it more faithfully than
the Mirrour: The one imitates the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
of the other, more than a
Parasite; to the end he may be like
his other self, yet not himself.</p>
            <p>While I was stammering out these
imperfect Notions, <hi>Cupid</hi> in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
snatch'd the Pen out of my
Hand, and flew away.</p>
