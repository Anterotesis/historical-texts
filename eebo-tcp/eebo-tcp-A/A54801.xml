            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Play has a double Reason for seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Shelter under Your Lordship; I Writ it, and for our <hi>Irish</hi> Stage, and You are the chief Friend which either has: But I shou'd be Cautious in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring what 'tis probable the World may Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn in you; since in the Humour the present Age is, for a Man to own that he thinks Plays even law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, 'tis almost enough to bring his Principles of Morality and Religion into Question. But, My Lord, the Firmness of yours is so well known, that I shall have no Reason to for bear saying, you have an Esteem for Plays; and I may, with Safety to
<pb facs="tcp:99696:3"/>
your Reputation, Applaud you for it, since I am Confident the greatest Zealot wou'd slacken his Fury against the Stage, and join with you in Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting it, did he know how earnestly you Wish it Reform'd from the Corruption of Manners, to the Encouraging Virtue, and Exposing Vice; and with what Decency, Modesty, and Good Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you wou'd have it Regulated. You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you Caution'd me to observe these Things, when I first acquainted you that I had a Design to Write this Comedy, and I have attempted to Obey you. I wish Your Lordship had given me farther Instructions; then, this wou'd have appear'd more Perfect and Correct to the World, and an Offering more Worthy you. As it is, I present it to you with Courage, because I know, the Errors your Judgment discerns, your Goodness will Excuse, and what you cannot Excuse you will at least Forgive. I only Wish there may be something in it which may prevent your Blushing while you Protect it, and shall very readily own the Faults the Criticks find in it; I have not yet heard them, but without doubt there are many, and therefore I think my self the more obliged to those who have been so particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly kind to this Play. They have sufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced how Inclinable they are to Encourage Wit and Poetry, by being so Favourable and so Generous
<pb facs="tcp:99696:3"/>
to my weak Attempts on both, who have so little of the one, and so unskill'd in the other. I shou'd be extreamly pleas'd, if my Success wou'd move any other who has a happier Genius, to divert this Town with some Performance of this kind. But it is my Satisfaction and Pride, that tho' he shou'd Write better, he cannot meet with more Encouragement than I have done. And since I own my Weakness, and yet boast of Success, you may be assur'd, that as I think my self Answerable for the former, so I know the latter is owing to your Lordship; another Proof of your accustomed Goodness, and a fresh Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to me. But this is a Subject I must not pursue, for tho' the acknowledgment of Obligations is but a small Return, yet I know you th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>; and therefore tho' Silence is a Pain to the Grateful, yet I choose to be uneasy to my self, rather than offensive to your Modesty, which I know will not Pardon my Publishing, what you will not allow me even to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when we are together. Give me leave only, My Lord, to assure you that I have a just Sense of your Favours, and that tho' I had ne're receiv'd one, yet I shou'd ever have been</p>

               <l>WHo to a Monarch humbly sues for Grace,</l>
               <l>Shou'd not Consult the Merits of his Case,</l>
               <l>So much, as those who offer his Address,</l>
               <l>'Tis by their Int'rest he must hope success,</l>
               <l>Our Author thus, who can no Merit Plead,</l>
               <l>But the harsh Censures he deserve does dread,</l>
               <l>Orders that I for Mercy Intercede.</l>
               <l>He Judges right, but in his Choice he's out,</l>
               <l>As he his Merit, I my Int'rest doubt.</l>
               <l>And well I may, since 'tis by different Arts,</l>
               <l>I must please Men, and gain the Ladies Hearts.</l>
               <l>The Beaus I wou'd Oblige, but that you know,</l>
               <l>Is more than one poor VVoman has Pow'r to do.</l>
               <l>Besides they're all so Mercenary grown,</l>
               <l>They'll grant no Favour, unless I grant one.</l>
               <l>Their Answer is, when we a Boon demand,</l>
               <l>Meet me at <hi>Chappellizard,</hi> or the <hi>Strand.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And that's a Bribe I think too dear to give,</l>
               <l>To let this Play their dreadful Rage survive.</l>
               <l>And from the Fair, what Mercy can be had!</l>
               <l>I fear they'll hate me for but seeming Bad.</l>
               <l>In hopes to please, now we have done the Play,</l>
               <l>I'll throw the Nausceous Mask of Vice away.</l>
               <l>And strive those Paths of Virtue to pursue,</l>
               <l>So strictly kept, so eminent in you.</l>

               <p>So is <hi>Freelove;</hi> That makes you so Gay. But Dear <hi>Aemilia,</hi> now I have mention'd him, inform me better of his Character, and tell me how you came acquainted with him, for he must be an Extraordinary Person that cou'd please you.</p>

               <speaker>Aemi.</speaker>
               <p>While I waited for a Wind at <hi>Chester,</hi> he chanc'd to come thither. He saw me, and it seems I displeas'd him not. He quickly found an opportunity to be acquainted, since I did not shun it; for I own at first view I lik'd him.</p>

               <p>How, at first View! What! You that such Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers have sigh'd for, and have been insensible to all; Like at sight!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Aemi.</speaker>
               <p>'Twere a Wrong to Friendship, and Beneath me, to dissemble with you. His Person pleas'd me; but when he talk'd, his Discourse appear'd so Soft, so Natural; his Wit so Lively and so Unconstrain'd; That, tho' I ever Dreaded the Inconveniencies of Love, I struggled harder to conceal my Flame, than to restrain my Heart; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Seen and Heard, 'twas mine no more.</p>

               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>Meer Rapture! But what Reputation has he in the World? For I regard that more than his Person or Wit.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aemi.</speaker>
               <p>As I, so he, was to most a Stranger. All agreed he had no Estate, but a Fine Gentleman.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>How's that! No Estate, and a Fine Gentleman! Advise him to keep where he is, if he would preserve that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99696:6"/>
Character. I assure you, 'tis as Difficult to be thought so here, without an Estate; as it is to be thought Honest and Get one.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Aemi.</speaker>
               <p>All are not of that Opinion, for if <hi>Bellmine</hi> had no Fortune, I suppose you wou'd think him a Fine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>I thank Heaven he has a very good one, and really Cousin, I find it much for his Interest in my Heart, that I never Considered him without One.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Not wholly so; perhaps I shou'd not esteem an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance the worse; But I think a Good Estate is one of the prettiest Qualifications a Husband can have; my Love may decay, but an Estate is a certain Good. Oh, 'tis such a Comfort! When my Husband is in a Dogged Humour, to call for my Glass Chariot, take the Air on the <hi>Strand,</hi> and make half a score pleasant Visits, and as many Conquests.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aemi.</speaker>

               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>Not Bare-fac'd Love, not Plain so; but certainly nothing pleases us more, than to be Admir'd; pleases us! pleases every Thing; What thing is not pleas'd to be Lik'd? Then 'tis a certain Cure for the Spleen. Can any thing be more Diverting than to have a Man who has ten times more Wit than I have, fall at my Feet, and Adore mine.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aemi.</speaker>
               <p>Can you think so, and not conclude it Flattery?</p>

               <p>Flattery! What then? Is not my Power still the Greater, to force him to say, what he does not think? Then I make my Husband Jealous by it.</p>

               <speaker>Mar.</speaker>
               <p>Oh a Great One! I have known it sharpen many a Stomach that was Cloy'd before. At Least, if Jealousie

               <speaker>Aemi.</speaker>
               <p>There is indeed a secret pleasure in having our Choice approv'd of; and I never knew a Man fond of his VVife, when she was slighted by others. He will no more boast of his Choice then, than she with Reason will boast of her Virtue. And it seems then, you do not doubt being Admir'd.</p>

               <p>VVhat than Love! Do you pretend to Love, and Consider any thing else but Love? Consider! pish, that word agrees as ill with Love, as with one of thy age. VVhy, when I was a young Fellow, I never consider'd any thing but how to get a Mistress, and then how to get rid of her.</p>

               <p>I very well know, Madam, Love is a Passion despis'd by all over whom it has not a present Sway; not only by those who never yet Lov'd, but even by those who have Lov'd. But I never make other Men's sentiments a standard for my Pleasures.</p>

               <p>Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> I have all the Respect and Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship for you, that a Man of your Excellent Parts can require with Modesty, but I must desire you not to talk so loosly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me. Marriage is a sacred thing, Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> a very sacred thing; yet it is a thing, Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> that may be abus'd, and may be perverted to raise indecent and unruly Cogitations.</p>

               <p>I presume you found Mr. <hi>Vainly</hi> here. I assure you, Sir <hi>Francis,</hi> I left the Room because he tacitly imply'd the thing Marriage, tho' on his knees, and with all the Chastity and Modesty imaginable.</p>

               <speaker>Lady <hi>Vol.</hi>
               </speaker>

               <p>This is a severe Task, Madam, that Sir <hi>Francis</hi> has impos'd upon me: To require me to make Love to you, and not for my self.</p>

               <p>He is very sensible, Sir, that his Daughter has Charms to secure you from one much more engaging.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
               <p>Fathers are as Blind as Lovers. And give me leave to think he is a much more indulgent Father, than passionate Lover, or he wou'd dread your greater Power wou'd make me false both to my Love and Friendship: And shou'd <hi>Marina</hi> make the same Tryal of my Constancy, she wou'd convince me she exceeds you as much in Vanity, as she is inferiour to you in every Charm.</p>

               <speaker>Lady <hi>Vol.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Truly, Sir, if Sir <hi>Francis</hi> had such a Talent of Elocution, I believe he might have succeeded long since. And for his Daughter, I conjecture I am not much inferiour to her in the superlative Charm, Fortune.</p>

               <p>That never was a Charm to me; tho' I cou'd wish it were one to you, since I can at least equal Sir <hi>Francis</hi>'s.</p>

               <p>Oh hideous! what can you regard in Mens Conversation, that is Divertive? they are all Insidious, you may believe me. They are always pestring a Woman with

their Love, then they beg Liberty to repeat their Visits, and implore a reciprocal Passion; and not contented with that, they desire to wait on her abroad, nay, to meet 'em abroad alone, and Mask'd, and when they have procur'd our Consent so far, then they imprudently proceed to—</p>

               <p>I was only going to Caution you of the Danger, and warn you to keep them at a distance, a vast distance, for some of 'em are so forward, that if we permit 'em to squeeze our Hand, they will incontinently Write to us, and the first Opportunity that offers, will force a Kiss, and they have no sooner ravish'd that, but—</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Trick.</speaker>
               <p>Why that bloated Belly, and those bladder Cheeks, that Crimson Hue, and those huge Pillars which support thee. Thou wer't as VVan and Thin when last I saw thee, as if you were just escaped from the Gallies.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>Ease and Plenty have made this Alteration, Eating well, and Lying soft. Thank my Stars, I thrive very well in this Coutry.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Trick.</speaker>
               <p>A very common one, for I have observ'd that none Despise <hi>Ireland</hi> so much as those who thrive best in it. And none are so severe in their Reflections upon it, as those who owe their Birth and Fortune to it; I have known many of 'em, when they come first to <hi>London,</hi> think there is no way so ready to purchase the Title of a Wit, as to Ridicule their own Country.</p>

               <p>Not altogether so Rich, as when I knew her first, but she has somewhat left still.</p>

               <p>No, I had the humility to dispense with the Title of Captain, which I assum'd immediately after my Arrival

in <hi>London;</hi> 'tis true I pretended to an Estate too, and so went a Fortune hunting.</p>

               <speaker>Trick.</speaker>
               <p>I can no more give you a particular account of her, than how I spent my fifty Guineas. She first apprehended the Cheat, and taking the opportunity of my being Drunk one Night, march'd off, and I never heard of her since. In a little time after having lost my VVife, pawn'd my Cloaths, and spent all my Money; I return'd to my old way of Living, and have got into a good Service again.</p>

               <p>I wish I cou'd find her out tho, not out of the least Passion for her Person, but for her Fortune, for she has some. Here comes the Getleman I now serve, an Admirable Man.</p>

               <p>She has some Wit when she talks to Inferiour People; but when in Conversation with those of Fashion and of Sense, she endeavours to elevate her Thoughts, (as she calls it) and refine her Language, and makes both unintelligible, so is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly Ridiculous, To be Witty she spoils her Language, and her Language confounds even what is Wit.</p>

               <p>For my part, I doubt the success of your Design; for I have so good an Opinion of my Uncle, that I do not think he will be perswaded to meet a Mask. I am sure he rails against such People more than any Man.</p>

               <p>Railing is no more a sign of Virtue, than of Wit. In this age People are seldom what they seem; there are some go to Church without Devotion. We have Criticks without Wit or Judgment; and some Fight without Courage; and there are Women very precise without Virtue. And I equally suspect the Woman who Boasts her Virtue, and the Man who Boasts his Valour; and it generally has the same effect, we are picked at it, and provok'd to destroy their Reputation.</p>

               <p>If she be such a VVoman, 'twill be Charity to prevent the Match. But I fancy, Mr. <hi>Bellmine,</hi> you have some self Interest in this Matter: You expect my Cousin's Fortune shou'd be encreas'd by this, to make you digest Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony the better, for I hear you have dreadful apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it, and are resolv'd to have a great Fortune.</p>

               <p>Both Reports of me have been truth, I must confess, Madam; but the more I see this Lady, the more my Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for the one, and my Regard for the other, are lessen'd.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>But Madam, you will not have favourable Thoughts for one who knows that, and yet dies for you. Who wou'd sacrifice his Life to be in that state which he there dreads.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Aem.</speaker>
               <p>But have you Consider'd all the Inconveniencies of Marrying a VVoman without a Fortune?</p>

               <p>All, all Madam; and wou'd undergo a thousand more for you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Free.</speaker>
               <p>I'll pitty their Ignorance. I have Consider'd all Madam, all the Hazards, all the Inconveniencies; how difficult to have a Man's Behaviour approv'd by all, that it is impossible to be thought a Kind Husband by the Women, and a prudent one by the Men. But you shall ever Rule your Conduct and my Heart. I give my Heart without Reserve, had I the World, I wou'd bestow it so. I will be still your Slave, still gaze upon those Eyes, and every look shall make me more your Slave. Oh I want words to tell how truly I adore you! or had I words that were Expressive, my Passion is too fierce to utter them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aem.</speaker>
               <p>If you declare your real Thoughts, your Passion cannot be greater than your Generosity; and may be easier Feign'd. You see I listen to your Love, because I believe it disinterested; if I thought it were not, not all your Art

               <p>Let me for ever talk, and only talk of Love. To Love be all the Business of my Life; it were abuse of Life to Live to any other End, be every Moment so employ'd; I talk, but it is Faint and Mean; my Heart now swells, and seems to heave and rage, that I no better can describe its Passion. It bids me say, amongst a thousand things that crowd upon my Tongue, I cannot Love you more, I ne're will Love you less.</p>

               <speaker>Bell.</speaker>
               <p>It wou'd be a damn'd unconscionable thing now in her, to remember all this after Marriage; for 'tis as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for VVomen to expect Love after enjoyment, as for a Man who had spent his Fortune, to expect as much Credit as when he had it in possession. <stage>(Aside.)</stage>
