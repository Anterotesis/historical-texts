            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF Mr. Thomas Hobbes OF MALMESBURY.</head>
            <l>IN Fifteen hundred eighty eight, Old Style,</l>
            <l>When that Armada did invade our Isle,</l>
            <l>Call'd the <hi>Invincible</hi>; whose Freight was then,</l>
            <l>Nothing but Murd'ring Steel, and Murd'ring Men;</l>
            <l>Most of which Navy was disperst, or lost,</l>
            <l>And had the Fate to Perish on our Coast:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>April</hi> the fifth (though now with Age outworn)</l>
            <l>I'th' early Spring, I, a poor worm, was born.</l>
            <l>In <hi>Malmesbury</hi> Baptiz'd, and Named there</l>
            <l>By my own Father, then a Minister.</l>
            <l>Many things worth relating had this Town;</l>
            <l>And first, a Monastery of Renown,</l>
            <l>And Castle, or two rather it may seem,</l>
            <l>On a Hill seated, with a double Stream</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49741:3"/>Almost environ'd, from whence still are sent</l>
            <l>Two Burgesses to sit in Parliament.</l>
            <l>Here lie the Bones of Noble <hi>Athelstane,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Whose Stone-Effigies does there remain;</l>
            <l>Who for reward gave them the Neighbouring Plains,</l>
            <l>Which he had moistned with the Blood of <hi>Danes.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Here was the <hi>Roman</hi> Muse by <hi>Adelm</hi> brought,</l>
            <l>Here also the first <hi>Latin</hi> Schole was taught.</l>
            <l>My Native place I'm not asham'd to own;</l>
            <l>Th'ill Times, and Ills born with me, I bemoan:</l>
            <l>For Fame had rumour'd, that a Fleet at Sea,</l>
            <l>Wou'd cause our Nations Catastrophe;</l>
            <l>And hereupon it was my Mother Dear</l>
            <l>Did bring forth Twins at once, both Me, and Fear.</l>
            <l>For this, my Countries Foes I e'r did hate,</l>
            <l>With calm Peace and my Muse associate.</l>
            <l>Did Learn to speak Four Languages, to write</l>
            <l>And read them too, which was my sole delight.</l>
            <l>Six years i'th' <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue I spent,</l>
            <l>And at Fourteen I was to <hi>Oxford</hi> sent;</l>
            <l>And there of <hi>Magd'len</hi>-Hall admitted, I</l>
            <l>My self to <hi>Logick</hi> first did then apply,</l>
            <l>And sedulously I my Tutor heard,</l>
            <l>Who Gravely Read, althou' he had no Beard.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49741:3"/>Barbara, Celarent, Darii, Ferio, Baralypton,</l>
            <l>These Modes hath the first Figure; then goes on</l>
            <l>Caesare, Camestres, Festino, Baroco, Darapti,</l>
            <l>This hath of Modes the same variety.</l>
            <l>Felapton, Disamis, Datisi, Bocardo, Ferison,</l>
            <l>These just so many Modes are look'd upon.</l>
            <l>Which I, tho' slowly Learn, and then dispense</l>
            <l>With them, and prove things after my own sense.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Physicks</hi> read, and my Tutor Display'd,</l>
            <l>How all Things were of Form and Matter made.</l>
            <l>The Aëry Particles which make Forms we see,</l>
            <l>Both Visible and Audible, to be</l>
            <l>Th'Effects of Sympathy, Antipathy.</l>
            <l>And many things above my reach Taught me.</l>
            <l>Therefore more pleasant studies I then sought,</l>
            <l>Which I was formerly, tho' not well Taught.</l>
            <l>My Phancie and my Mind divert I do,</l>
            <l>With Maps Celestial and Terrestrial too.</l>

            <l>Know by what Art he measures out our Days;</l>
            <l>How <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Cavendish</hi> a Girdle made</l>
            <l>Quite round the World, what Climates they survey'd;</l>
            <l>And strive to find the smaller Cells of Men.</l>
            <l>And painted Monsters in their unknown Den.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49741:4"/>Nay there's a Fulness in Geography;</l>
            <l>For Nature e'r abhor'd Vacuity.</l>
            <l>Thus in due time took I my first Degree</l>
            <l>Of Batchelor i'th' University.</l>
            <l>Then <hi>Oxford</hi> left; serv'd <hi>Ca'ndish</hi> known to be</l>
            <l>A Noble and Conspicuous Family.</l>
            <l>Our College-Rector did me Recommend,</l>
            <l>Where I most pleasantly my Days did spend.</l>
            <l>Thus Youth Tutor'd a Youth; for he was still</l>
            <l>Under Command, and at his Father's will:</l>
            <l>Serv'd him full twenty years, who prov'd to be,</l>
            <l>Not a Lord only, but a Friend to Me.</l>
            <l>That my Life's sweetest Comfort was, and made</l>
            <l>My Slumbers pleasant in Nights darkest shade.</l>
            <l>Thus I at Ease did Live, of Books, whilst he</l>
            <l>Did with all sorts supply my Library.</l>
            <l>Then I our own Historians did peruse,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi> and Convers'd too with my Muse.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil, Horace, Sophocles,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Plautus, Euripides, Aristophanes,</l>
            <l>I understood, nay more; but of all these,</l>
            <l>There's none that pleas'd me like <hi>Thucydides.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He says Democracy's a Foolish Thing,</l>
            <l>Than a Republick Wiser is one King.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49741:4"/>This Author I taught <hi>English,</hi> that even he</l>
            <l>A Guide to Rhetoricians might be.</l>
            <l>To Forrain Countries at that time did I</l>

            <l>But yet provided ere he di'd for me,</l>
            <l>Who liv'd with little most contentedly.</l>
            <l>I left my pleasant Mansion, went away</l>
            <l>To <hi>Paris,</hi> and there eighteen Months did stay,</l>
            <l>Thence to be Tutor I'm cal'd back agen,</l>
            <l>To my Lord's Son, the Earl of <hi>Devon</hi> then.</l>
            <l>This Noble Lord I did instruct when young,</l>
            <l>Both how to Speak and Write the <hi>Roman</hi> Tongue;</l>
            <l>And by what Arts the Rhetor deceives those</l>
            <l>That are Illiterate; taught him Verse and Prose;</l>
            <l>The Mathematick Precepts too, with all</l>
            <l>The Windings in the Globe Terrestrial;</l>
            <l>The whole Design of Law, and how he must</l>
            <l>Judge between that which Equal is and Just.</l>
            <l>Seven years to him these Arts I did Explain:</l>
            <l>He quickly Learnt, and firmly did retain.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49741:5"/>We spent not all this time in Books alone,</l>
            <l>Unless you'l take the World for to be one;</l>
            <l>Travel'd through <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> did view</l>

            <l>Whether on Horse, in Coach, or Ship, still I</l>

            <l>One only thing i'th' World seem'd true to me,</l>
            <l>Tho' several ways that Falsified be.</l>
            <l>One only True Thing, the Basis of all</l>
            <l>Those Things whereby we any Thing do call.</l>

            <l>A Weighty Lasting Grief did me befal.</l>
            <l>(Thou'rt Dead, <hi>Godolphin,</hi> who lov'dst Reason, true</l>
            <l>Justice and Peace, Soldier Belov'd, Adieu)</l>
            <l>Twice forty pounds, a yearly Pension, then</l>
            <l>I from my own Country receiv'd; and when</l>
            <l>King <hi>Charles</hi> restored was, a hundred more</l>
            <l>Was allow'd me out of his private Store.</l>
            <l>A Noble Gift: I slight Reproaches, when</l>
            <l>I know I'm Good, from other Black-mouth'd Men.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49741:11"/>Content with this, desire no more Pelf;</l>
            <l>Who but a Mad-man lives beneath himself?</l>
            <l>Let my Estate by yours Computed be,</l>
            <l>And greater seem; if not, it's enough for me.</l>
            <l>My Sums are small, and yet live happy so,</l>
            <l>Richer than <hi>Croesus</hi> far, and <hi>Crassus</hi> too.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Verdusius,</hi> thou know'st my Temper well,</l>
            <l>And those who read my Works, and with thee dwell.</l>
            <l>My Life and Writings speak one Congruous Sense;</l>
            <l>Justice I Teach, and Justice Reverence.</l>
            <l>None but the Covetous we Wicked call,</l>
            <l>For Avarice can do no good at all.</l>
            <l>I've now Compleated my Eighty fourth year,</l>
            <l>And Death approaching, prompts me not to fear.</l>
