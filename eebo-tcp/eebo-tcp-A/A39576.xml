         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ON the day of your last solemn Fast and Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was on the third day of this <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
month 1659. I told you in the Name of God, who
then moved me so to do, that you cannot possibly
prosper in your Councels, nor be accepted in your sacrifices,
if before him you be found guilty of forswearing your selves,
which whether you are or no in that tedious Case of <hi>Tithes,</hi>
I then also warned you to consider: I have since that seen such
necessity laid upon me from the Lord this once more to
arise and contend on the Lords behalf, who hath a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
with you, O ye mountains, and ye strong foundations of
the earth, that whatever should befal me from you for so
doing, yet wo is unto me from him if I do it not: in order to
the clearing of my Conscience in which service, and in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to him, whose Spirit hath prest me to it, and also in
bowels of true love to all your Souls, and tender compassion
to this bleeding Nation, I have here presented you with
these few following Queries, which you are to read in the
fear of the Lord, and in the light of God, that shines into all
Souls, and searches the secrets of all your hearts, to answer
to God himself in your own Consciences.</p>
            <p>1. Whether have you not said, vowed, covenanted and
sworn, and caused this Nation to vow, covenant and swear
with hands lifted up to the most High God, to endeavor to the
utmost of your, and their power the Extirpation of all Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
in Religion, Popish institution, superstition, &amp;c.
and to Reform according to the example of the best Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Churches?</p>
            <p>2 Whether <hi>Parish</hi>-Churches, <hi>Parish</hi>-Priests, and the <hi>Parish</hi>-pay
by that way of <hi>Tithes</hi> (which was the Ordinance of God
under the Law, which together with the Priesthood thereof
is now changed be not <hi>Superstitions, Innovations</hi> and <hi>Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of the <hi>Pope,</hi> imposing the establishment thereof by their
civil Laws upon simple <hi>Priest-Ridden</hi> Princes, Powers and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,
in the dark dayes of his undue dominion over
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63754:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them in this <hi>English</hi> Nation, and that so unquestionably,
that none of you, but such as are willingly so, can in these
times of Trying of all things be easily ignorant of it?</p>
            <p>3. Whether it be any less then cursed <hi>Covenant breaking,</hi> and
<hi>palpable Perjury</hi> in your selves, or any that have so vowed, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted
and sworn as aforesaid, not to endeavour the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation
aforesaid, much more in stead of removing that
<hi>Popish yoke of Tithes</hi> to re-establish the payment of it with <hi>Treble
dammages?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Whether you may not be said so to re-establish it, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
notwithstanding the onely way and means of recovery of
<hi>Tithes,</hi> that ever stood by <hi>Law</hi> in this Nation, which was that
of the <hi>Spiritual Courts</hi> (there being an expess Statute yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
unrepealed, that it shall not be lawful for any man to
be summoned before any <hi>Secular Iudge,</hi> or sued in any <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Court</hi> in that matter) is (<hi>de jure</hi>) taken away already in the
fall of the <hi>Bishops Hierarchy,</hi> and of the said <hi>Spiritual Courts,</hi>
you nevertheless encourage the <hi>Iudges,</hi> by your <hi>Orders</hi> and
<hi>Ordinances</hi> to try that Case of <hi>Tithes</hi> in their <hi>Temporal
Courts,</hi> who do accordingly so strictly reinforce the payment
of <hi>Tithes,</hi> that such tender consciences as because of the <hi>Oaths</hi>
and <hi>Vowes</hi> to God you have bound them in, and to avoid
the guilt of <hi>Perjury,</hi> dare not pay them, by such <hi>H<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ngry Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies</hi>
and <hi>Greedy Gatherers</hi> as the <hi>Parish</hi>-preachers make use of,
have not onely <hi>Treble,</hi> but sometimes <hi>Tenfold</hi> dammages forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
wrested from them: which said <hi>Iud<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es,</hi> forasmuch as
they are also sworn <hi>(as Iudges)</hi> not to Act against any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
Law, whether in so acting they are not doubly forsworn,
'tis good for them timely to examine?</p>
            <p>5. Whether the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who came after <hi>Tithes,</hi> who were to
go into all Nations, Ministring the <hi>Gospel,</hi> did ever m<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ke such
complaint for <hi>Tithes,</hi> as the Ministers of the Nations now do
to <hi>Magistrates?</hi> And whether was there not provision enough
for them, not by compulsion, nor yet by <hi>Tithes,</hi> but as love
constrained, by which they then ministred one to another,
though they were scattered up and down through many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
whereas these <hi>Ministers</hi> settle themselves in Parishes, for
<hi>Term-of-life?</hi> And whether is it not more according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the <hi>best Resormed Churches,</hi> which are those of the
<hi>Primitive times,</hi> as well as a more likely way to end that end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63754:2"/>
strife, which to the stark stinking shame of their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and to the wearying of the whole Nation the men called
<hi>Ministers</hi> are together by the ears in with all manner of <hi>people,</hi>
to leave all manner of <hi>people freely</hi> to chuse, and <hi>freely</hi> to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the <hi>Ministers</hi> of their own chusing, and all <hi>Mini<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ters free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
to give out what <hi>freely</hi> they have received, according to
Christs Command, to such as he sends them, then to force the
<hi>Flocks</hi> of other folds to feed and cloath such <hi>Hireling shepherds,</hi>
as they neither hire, nor hear, nor were ever fed by, and
against their own consciences to help to uphold such <hi>Steal-Sermons,</hi>
and <hi>Sell-Sermons</hi> as <hi>God</hi> neither sent nor spoke to, and
such <hi>Seers</hi> concerning whom they see the <hi>Sun</hi> is already set
upon them?</p>
            <p>6. Whether it be possibly to be expected (unless <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
be so changed as to take pleasure in iniquity) that <hi>God</hi>
should take pleasure in this Nation, or that the Parliament,
and people thereof should ever prosper truly into a <hi>Common-VVealth,</hi>
and not rather perish at last by some <hi>Common Wo,</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and calamity, if it be found before him in the cases a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid,
under the guilt of those gross sins of <hi>covenant breaking</hi>
and <hi>perjury?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. Whether it be possible (unlesse <hi>God</hi> be changed from
what he was of old) that your many prayers should enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ears of the Lord of hosts, that your fastings and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations
(which are but fa<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed if you turn not to him that
smites you with all your hearts) should find acceptance with
him, that your most solemn meetings should meet with any
thing but rejection as <hi>iniquity</hi> and <hi>hypocrisie,</hi> and that he
should deliver you in your callings upon him in this day of
your trouble, if he find you guil<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y of falshood, and forswear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your selves, if you perform not to the Lord your <hi>Oaths,</hi> &amp;
pay not your <hi>Vows</hi> unto the most high? and whether were it
not much better for you to hearken then hastily to offer, or
to obey then to sacrifice with your hands full of blood?</p>
            <p>8. Whether it be a sufficient plea before God in the cases
aforesaid for this <hi>Parliament</hi> to say that the land cannot bear
the taking away of <hi>Tithes,</hi> as if the perfect removal of the <hi>Popes
yoak</hi> from off their necks and the return of <hi>Tithes</hi> to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
who are the right Original owners thereof, and might at
first keep them to themselves, till <hi>doting Doctors</hi> deceived them
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63754:3"/>
into a bestowing thereof, or might bestow them on the poor,
or on whom they pleased till <hi>P. Innocent</hi> the third imposed the
paymen<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of them to <hi>Parish priests,</hi> were insufferable to the
Saints, unsafe to a Nation that perfectly <hi>protests</hi> against the
<hi>Pope</hi> and all his <hi>impositions;</hi> or as if any but the blind <hi>Popishly
affected party</hi> that are your flattering foes, or any of that <hi>well
affected party</hi> who have been your constant friends, whom you
have engaged to live and die with in so good a cause, would
kick, and fling, and be impatient under the burthen of their
own freedoms?</p>
            <p>9. Whether would not the breaking of every such <hi>Popish
yoke</hi> from off their Consciences encourage all the aforesaid
<hi>well-affected party,</hi> so as to knit them firmly to you; And
whether doth it not rather discourage and weaken their
hearts and hands to youward upon any occasion, when assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from them is expected, to see all their <hi>Hopes</hi> frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
all your <hi>Vows, Oaths</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> disregarded, your
<hi>Promises</hi> falsified, and their <hi>Petitions</hi> and <hi>Propositions</hi> to you in
the particular aforesaid sleighted, or at best answered with
only thanks for their good affections, and assurances that the
things desired are under Consideration, when yet from time
to time that which by <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> should have been
long since <hi>Removed,</hi> by your new <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> for it
stands still rather <hi>Re-established?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. Whether the <hi>Parish Priesthood</hi> of this Nation, who are
well, neither full nor fasting, do deserve that this Parliament
should make such provision for them, as they do, and take
so much care as they have done for their <hi>Tithes,</hi> when as
both now, and upon every occasion, as well when things go
well with them, as when worse, they are ready to arise up in
<hi>Armes</hi> against you with any <hi>discontended,</hi> whether <hi>Kingly,
Priestly</hi> or <hi>Popish party,</hi> to the eminent endangering of the
whole <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> the infinite expending and exhausting
of the <hi>Treasure</hi> thereof, the <hi>Imbroiling</hi> of this Nation in new
War<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> till it welter in its own <hi>blood,</hi> and contrary to the
<hi>Scripture,</hi> which wills all <hi>Ministers</hi> to be no <hi>Strikers, imbruing</hi>
their own hands in the <hi>innocent blood</hi> thereof?</p>
