            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:34593:3"/>
               <hi>true Protestants,</hi> or not. You do all indeed lay claim to the Title of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants;</hi> But as they were of old, who called themselves <hi>Jews,</hi> but were not; so in this day, there are many who call themselves <hi>Protestants,</hi> but are not, for they agree not with the Antient Testimonie and Spirit of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> but are exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from them, both in Life and Doctrine, who if they had been true to the <hi>Protetant Cause,</hi> for which God raised up the first <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,</hi> above one hundred years ago, had not only retained the Life and Doctrine of the <hi>Antient Protestants,</hi> but had advanced further, and gone beyond them both in largness of Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, and Purity of Life, for at that time, it was but as the Twy-light, or <hi>Dawning of the Day,</hi> so that they had not attained unto so clear and perfect discoveries of Truth, as were afterwards to come: but oh, how have
<pb facs="tcp:34593:3"/>
the most of them all, who in this day are called <hi>Protestants,</hi> not only been <hi>deficient in advancing and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on that Testimony and Cause</hi> for which the Lord raised up the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive <hi>Protestants,</hi> but are fallen ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding short of them, yea degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and back sliden from them in those weightiest and most material things, which they bore Testimony unto in their day, as they were called forth of th Lord, and furnished by him, not only to appear for his Truth in Words, but with a most noble and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Courage to Seal it with their Blood, among whom <hi>William Tindal</hi> was one of the most Eminent, whose Works and Labours, by the Blessing and Grace of God, were of great use to propagate knowledge unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of these Nations in that day, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Ignorance and Darkness so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded. This <hi>William Tindal,</hi> was a man not only of a pious and good
<pb facs="tcp:34593:4"/>
Life, but well Learned, as appeareth in that he <hi>Translated the Bible,</hi> both the Old and New Testament, so called, out of the Tongues in which they were originally writ, <hi>into the English;</hi> whose Translation is the first <hi>English</hi> Translation that is extant, and a good work it was in that day, and of great service among the peolpe, which made the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy so angry (who would have still hoodwinck'd the People in Ignorance) that they <hi>ceased not until they got him burnt,</hi> who suffered <hi>Martyrdom</hi> for the Truth, in <hi>West Flanders,</hi> in the days of <hi>Queen Mary;</hi> But above all, <hi>he was a Man endowed with a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Spirit of God, and taught of God,</hi> as both his own Works, and the History of his Life Recorded by <hi>Fox</hi> in his <hi>Martyrology,</hi> doth sufficiently make manifest unto any who have a Spiritual discerning: and if there be any things found in his
<pb facs="tcp:34593:4"/>
Works, which Answer not perfectly to the Truth, it is to be imputed to the Darkness and Ignorance of that time, which God wincked at; nor should these things, which were given him, as Testimonies from the Lord, to bear in his day, be the less esteemed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, because of any Weakness or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, as touching some things, wherein he might be swayed by the darkness of that time in which he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; But rather we should be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto God for his Mercy, in that he lighted such a Candle, and set it on a Candlestick to shine as a <hi>Light in a dark place,</hi> while Darkness was so thick throughout all the Land. I could cite the Testimonies of many other Witnesses, who sealed their Testimony with their Blood unto the Truth, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and also in other places. But this being done partly by others formerly, and as it may please the Lord so to order it, it
<pb facs="tcp:34593:5"/>
may yet be done more largly, only at this time I found my self moved in the Zeal of the Lord, to give forth this small <hi>Treatise,</hi> being <hi>a faithful Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the words</hi> of the aforesaid <hi>William Tindal,</hi> extracted by me, out of his Printed Works with my own hand, <hi>without adding unto, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing from them,</hi> so much as one word, only the <hi>Titles</hi> I have added be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore each Purpose, by way of <hi>Index.</hi> My design is to make it known, that we, the People in derision called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>

                  <p>Concerning <hi>Faith, how that the true Faith, is a feeling Faith.</hi>

                  <p>In his <hi>Answer to Sir</hi> Tho. Mores <hi>Dialogue,</hi> 1530.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere are two manner of Faiths, an Historical Faith, and a Feeling Faith. The Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Faith hangeth on the Truth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34593:9"/>
and Honesty of the Teller, or on the Common Fame and Consent of many: as if one told me, that the <hi>Turk</hi> had wone a City, and I belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, moved with the Honesty of the man: now if there comes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that seemeth more Honest, or that hath better perswasions that it is not so, I think Immediately that he lyed, and lose my Faith again. And a Feeling Faith is, as if a man were there present when it was won, and there were wounded, and had there lost all that he had, and were taken Prisoner there also. That Man should so believe that all the World could not turn him from his Faith: even likewise if my Mother had blown on her Finger, and told me that the Fire would burn me, I should have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her with an Hystorical Faith, as we believe the Stories of the World, because I thought she
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34593:9"/>
would not have mocked me: and so I should have done, if she had told me that the Fire had been cold, and would not have burned: but assoon as I had put my Finger in the Fire, I should have believed, not by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of her, but with a feeling Faith, so that she could not have perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me afterward the contrary. So now with an Historical Faith, I may believe that the Scripture is Gods, by the teaching of them, and so I should have done, though they had told me that <hi>Robinhood</hi> had been the Scripture of God, which Faith is but an Opinion, and therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth ever fruitless, and falleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, if a more glorious reason be made unto me, or if the Preacher live contrary.</p>
               <p>But of a <hi>Feeling Faith,</hi> it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>John 6. they shall be all taught of God, that is, God shall writ it in their hearts with his Holy Spirit,</hi> and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34593:10"/>
also teftifieth <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>The Spirit bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth record unto our Spirit, that we be the Sons of God;</hi> and this Faith is none <hi>Opinion,</hi> but a sure feeling, and therefore ever fruitful, never hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it of the honesty of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but of the Power of God, and of the Spirit: and therefore if all the Preachers of the World would go about to perswade the contrary, it would not prevail no more than though they would make me believe the fire were cold, after that I had put my finger therein. Of this ye have an ensample, <hi>Job.</hi> 4. of the <hi>Samaritanish Wife, which left her Pitcher and went into the City, and said, come and see a man,</hi> &amp;c. but when they had heard Christ, the Spirit wrought, and made them feel, whereupon they came unto the Woman and said, <hi>We believe not now, because of thy saying, but because we have heard our selves, and</hi>

                  <hi>know, that he is Christ, the Saviour of the World:</hi> for Christ's Preaching was with Power and Spirit, that maketh a man feell and know, and work too, and not as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> preached, and as ours, make a man ready to cast his gorge to hear them, rave and rage as mad men.</p>

                  <p>Concerning <hi>Justification.

               <argument>
                  <p>That <hi>Magistrates may Preach, and that every Man that is well taught may Preach, or Teach, in case of necessity; as when the ordinary Preachers are ignorant, and Preach false Doctrine, and that Women may Teach.</hi>

                  <p>In his <hi>exposition on</hi> Mat. 5.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALL Kings and all Rulers are bound to be Salt and Light, not only in example of living, but also in Teaching of Doctrine unto their Subjects, as well as they be bound to punish evil doers. Doth not the Scripture testifie that King David was chosen to be a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd, and to feed his People with Gods Word? It is an evil School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Master, that cannot but beat only;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34593:15"/>
but it is a good Schoolmaster, that so teacheth, that few need to be beaten.</p>
               <p>Again, moreover every Man ought to Preach in word and deed unto his Houshold, and to them that are under his governance. And though no Man may Preach open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, save he that hath the Office committed unto him; yet ought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man to endeavour himself, to be as well Learned as the Preacher, as nigh as it is possible. And eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man may privately inform his Neighbour; yea, and the Preacher and Bishop too, if need be: For if the Preacher Preach wrong, you may, any Man, whatsoever he be, rebuke him, first privately; and then (if that help not) to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain further; and when all is proved, according to the order of Charity, and yet no amendment had: then ought every Man that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:34593:15"/>
can to resist him, aud to stand by Christs Doctrine, and to jeopard Life and all for it; look on the old ensamples, and they shall teach thee—when we have proved all that Charity bindeth us, and yet in vain; then we must come forth openly, and rebuke their wickedness in the face of the World, and jeopard Life and all thereon.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> his Faith was, that <hi>the Heathen once bad the Spirit of God, and that</hi> Pharoah, <hi>before his heart was bardened, had the Spirit of Grace, and this is our Faith</hi> who say, <hi>the true Light which is Spirit, doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten every man that cometh into the world, sufficiently unto Salvation, and that a manifestation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is given unto every man to profit withal.</hi> But whether is this <hi>your faith</hi> yea or nay? <hi>who deny the saving Light of Christ to be Universal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> His Faith was, that <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works through working of the Spirit of</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:34593:19"/>
                  <hi>God, are absolutely needful to continue us in the favour of God, and in a justified state,</hi> and this is our Faith, but whether this is <hi>your Faith</hi> yea or nay, seeing <hi>many of you say,</hi> David <hi>continued in the favour of God, and justified, while he committed Murder and Adultery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> His Faith was, that <hi>a Believer needed no outward Law nor Rule, for he keepeth the Law, by the leading of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit only,</hi> and this is our Faith, but whether is this <hi>your Faith,</hi> yea or nay, who say <hi>the Scripture,</hi> (which is outwardly) <hi>is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rule, and will not acknowledg the Spirit within to be the Rule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> his Faith was, that <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are to be believed that they are of God, because of the Inward Testimony and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of God, and that the true Faith is a feeling Faith, &amp; a sure feeling, &amp; who have this Faith, are taught of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as immediately as when a man is taught that the fire is hct, by putting his finger in it, here the fire teacheth him immediately, that it is hot, and he needeth no man to tell him,</hi> and this is our Faith in all these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, <hi>who witness unto the immediate Teachings of God by his Spirit in our hearts.</hi> But whether is this <hi>your Faith</hi> yea or nay,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34593:20"/>
who <hi>deny spiritual feeling and sense to be essential to true Faith, telling people they must not seek to live by spiritual sense and feeling, but by Faith; as also telling them, that Faith may be without assurance.</hi> This is contrary to, <hi>Will. Tindall</hi> his Faith, and contrary to the Scriptures Testimony, which calleth Faith and Guidence, a See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Handling, all which imply both spiritual Sence and Assureance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> His Faith was, that <hi>men were to believe the Principles of their Religion, not because they are written in books but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are inwardly taught by the Spirit of God,</hi> and this is our Faith, but whether is this <hi>your Faith,</hi> yea or nay, who say, <hi>the Scriptures are the formal object of Faith, and the first Rule or moving Cause by way of object, to make us believe,</hi> and who say, <hi>immediate Revelation is ceased, and is not the general priviledge of all true Believers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> His Faith was, that <hi>the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit was to be felt, and was to be known by feeling, and that none should think his Faith right, who hath not the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit,</hi> and this is our Faith, but whether is this <hi>your Faith,</hi> yea or nay, who <hi>deny tbe feeling of the Spirit,</hi> properly so called, <hi>and mock and deride us when we</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:34593:20"/>
                  <hi>speak of feeling, and when ye ask us, how know ye that you are moved &amp; led by theSpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to such things, we answer, by our feeling, which bath certainty, and evidence in it that is sufficient.</hi> This Answer ye reject, as <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical, Heretical,</hi> and what not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> His Faith was, that <hi>men are justified by an inward Righteousness wrought by the Spirit of God in the beart:</hi> and this is our Faith, but whether is this <hi>your Faith,</hi> yea or nay, who <hi>deny that any are justified by an inward rigbteousness in their hearts, although wrought in them by the Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> His Faith was, that <hi>the first day of the Week, was not commanded by God to be kept boly, but the Church keepeth that day, because of convenience for instructing the people, and worshiping God:</hi> and this is our Faith, but whether is this <hi>your Faith,</hi> yea or nay, who say, <hi>that day is of Gods commanding to be kept as a Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> His Faith was, that <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates may Preach, and every man may Preach or Teach, who is taught of God, in case of necessity, and that Women may teach:</hi> and this is our Faith, but whether is this <hi>your Faith,</hi> yea or nay, vvho <hi>would mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polise it unto the Clergy, or a certain order of Literate Men.</hi>

                  <hi>Thirteenthly,</hi> His Faith vvas, that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy and School. learning was not needful to understand the Scripture, nor to be a Preacher or Divine:</hi> and this is our Faith, but vvhether is this <hi>your Faith,</hi> yea or nay, <hi>who lay so great stress upon Philosophy and School-Learning, that ye permit none to be Preachers, or Doctors of Divinity who have not them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourteenthly,</hi> His Faith vvas, as also the Faith of <hi>John Frith,</hi> another <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Teacher</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Martyr,</hi> that <hi>Hereticks were not to be punished with Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment, Fetters, Scourging, Sword and Fire:</hi> and this vvas the Faith of many others in that day, and this is our Faith; but vvhether is this <hi>your Faith,</hi> yea or nay, <hi>whose chiefest Arguments against us,</hi> the people in derision called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have been <hi>Prisons, Banishings, Scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, spoiling of Goods, and such like car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and violent ways.</hi>
