            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Merchant.</speaker>
               <p>SIR, you are well met: Pray
when came you to Town? and
what's the beſt News in the
Countrey?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gentleman.</speaker>
               <p>I came to Town laſt Night, <hi>Sir,</hi> but
for News I have none good: We are quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded,
and know not what to do either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
or paying of Guinea's; and we think you
Citizens are to blame for Petitioning the Parliament
to have them brought down, when if they were
let alone they would paſs more currently than any
Money we have at 30 <hi>s.</hi> a piece, and every one
would be quiet and contented.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, Sir, But we ſee further than you do
in this Matter, and therefore cannot be contented,
becauſe we know we ſhall have no Silver left in a
little while, if Guinea's are kept up above the old
Value.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:103609:3"/>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>We have Silver little enough already, tho'
Gold be plentier than ever 'twas, and d'ye think
they won't carry that away too when we ſhall
lower it? What is it keeps it here now, and brings
us in more, but our making it paſs for more than
'twill in any other Countrey? I think if we were
wiſe, we ſhould raiſe our Silver alſo, and ſo keep
both at home.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Well Sir, ſince that's your Opinion, and
it ſeems ſo plauſible, that I doubt a great many more
lye under the ſame Miſtake, I'le try if I can bring
you to a righter underſtanding of this matter; in
order whereto, I'le firſt ask you, What d'ye think
our ſilver has been carried away for? and for what
will it continue to be ſent away?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>We think it goes to pay the Army in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and that more will goe, 'till we have none leſt,
if ſome better care ben't taken.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Don't you ſee the Parliament finds it for
our ſafety to maintain the War abroad, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do appropriate part of the Taxes every year
for the payment of the Army; and would you then
have the King keep the Money at home in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,
and let that part of the Army that is abroad
ſtarve the while?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>God forbid; I had much rather pay towards
the maintaining an Army abroad, than let the <hi>French</hi>
come and plunder us at home, and at laſt reduce
us into <hi>French</hi> Slavery. Then we muſt be forc'd
to pay what they will pleaſe to take, and now no
more can be taken from us than what we by our
own conſents in Parliament give. But why can't
we ſend out Goods, our own Manufactories, to pay
our Army, and keep our Money at home?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:103609:3"/>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>You may be aſſur'd that we do yearly
ſend as much Goods as the Forreign Markets will
take off, but we can't force 'em to buy more than
their Occaſions require: And as Matters ſtand now,
that is not enough to ſupply all we want?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>But I have heard that Money may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by Bills of Exchange, and ſo we need not
ſend away our Silver and Gold</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt know, Sir, that Bills of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
will ſignifie nothing, unleſs we put a value
in the Perſons Hands on whom we draw to pay
them withall: Now as I told you before, if all the
Goods which our Neighbours can take off from us
be not of Value ſufficient to pay to pay all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
we have occaſion to uſe there, if we draw Bills
for above the Produce of our Goods, we muſt ſend
Silver or Gold to pay our Bills, there being no other
way to enable our Correſpondents to do it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Well, Sir, I am now ſatisfied that it is not
poſſible for us to maintain our Army abroad, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſending out ſome of our Silver and Gold; that
is to ſay, ſo much as the Goods our Neighbours buy
of us fall ſhort of raiſing the Value we want in
thoſe Countries; but I ſhould have thought that this
difference could not have been ſo great, as to have
required ſuch large Quantities as they ſay have been
ſent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Now you bring me to the matter; and
as I have been telling you, that the Produce of our
Trade abroad is not at this time ſufficient to pay for
all the Forreign Commodities which we bring home
for our own Expence, and maintain our Army al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
yet as you have well gueſs'd, that Occaſion
would not have drein'd our Silver ſo faſt, but 'tis the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103609:4"/>
vaſt Stock of Gold that hath been brought over,
hath robb'd us of great quantities of our Silver.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Sir, is it Matter of Complaint, that
we have plenty of Gold brought into the Kingdom?
are we not ſo much the richer for it? how can that
rob us of our Silver?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>We ſhould indeed be the richer, if we
imported Gold as the Produce of our Trade, and
not at an Over-value; but I ſee, Sir, your Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is not quite opened in this matter; pray
conſider, if we could not before pay our Army
without ſending out ſome ſilver, do you think that
Forreigners gave us their Gold for nothing? or
will you not rather believe our Silver went to pay
ſor't?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>I now ſee what you drive at, 'tis to ſhew
me that much of our Silver hath been ſent abroad
to buy Gold; but I have been told that Forreigners
ſent their Gold hither to buy Goods, and I know
the Countrey had a brisk Trade all the laſt Summer
in ſelling their Manufactories at extraordinary rates.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>The Matter doth indeed look ſo, but it's
all a Fallacy, and I'll ſhew you plainly how this Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
proceeded; and there's too much reaſon to
doubt that 'twas projected amongſt our ſelves, by
ſome Perſons who would let ſlip no opportunity of
raiſing their own private Fortunes, though it were
to the ruine of the Publick; for we ſaw plainly that
the Guinea's were rais'd upon us the beginning of laſt
Summer by artifice, and 'twas at firſt given out
that they would ſoon come to 30 <hi>s.</hi> the Pretence
for it being the badneſs of our Money; immediately
upon this we had great ſtore of Gold brought over
in all the Men of War and Yatchts that came from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103609:4"/>
                  <hi>Holland,</hi> not only in Guineas, but alſo in the Coins
of <hi>Holland, Germany, Denmark,</hi> and all thoſe Adjacent
Countries.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Theſe Traders in Gold then fell to buying up
the Silver ſo faſt, that in a little time they run it up
from 5 <hi>s. 8 d.</hi> to 6 <hi>s. 9 d.</hi> or 7 <hi>s. per Ounce;</hi> and as
that roſe, they ſtruck in for all the Bills of Exchange
they could find, and thoſe were preſently brought
to above 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> loſs to us. Tis true, that the
badneſs of our Money gave ſome reaſon for this:
But 'tis obſervable, that before theſe Guinea-Jobbers
did by ſuch means adminiſter the occaſion, People
did not begin to diſeſteem the Value of our Money,
but did as it were rely upon the Honour of the
Government to make good the deficiency at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
or other: Then they fell upon buying up
our Manufactures, or any thing elſe they could lay
their Hands on, for which they could put off their
Guinea's amongſt us, and hope to ſell it again in
ſome Country or other for ſilver, tho' it were at
a lower price then it coſt them. It's true, that our
People were not ſo ſilly as not to make an advance
upon their Commodities, when they ſaw ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:
Yet even that advance was leſs than the
worth of their Goods, when they were paid in Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea's
at 30 <hi>s.</hi> and you'll find at laſt that this was but
a bad Trade for the Kingdom, when you come to
conſider that all the Bills or Silver theſe Gold-Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
ſent over, was what would otherwiſe have gone
to ſupply the King's Occaſions, who muſt ſend ſo
much ſilver the more in lieu thereof; and that the
great advance upon all Forreign Exchanges which
was chiefly occaſioned thereby, was ſome hundreds
of thouſand Pounds loſs to the Nation, not only in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103609:5"/>
the aforeſaid occaſion of paying our Army, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in the maintaining of our Fleet abroad, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
that at home with Naval Stores, which
muſt coſt the dearer perhaps by one third part:
That all theſe Goods of ours, were not bought up
to ſupply the demands of any Forreign Market, but
do yet lye the greateſt part of them on hand, and
you may now buy them cheaper in <hi>Holland</hi> than
here, ſo that we muſt not expect any great demand
for our Manufactures 'till this glut is gone off; and
in the end, I doubt the Nation muſt loſe little leſs
than a Million of Money by the fall of this dear
bought Gold, altho' thoſe Perſons that have taken
care to put off their Gold in time, may bear little
of this Loſs.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>I now ſee plainly that our ſuffering ſo
great a riſe upon Guinea's, hath been very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
to us; but now ſince they are up, why can't
we keep them up, and ſave all that loſs?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>To anſwer you to that, you muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that whatever People may form in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
there is as it were a Standard for the
Value of Gold, which is pretty nearly aſſented to
by moſt of the People of <hi>Europe;</hi> and the higheſt
proportion it bears to Silver is as one to ſixteen;
and our Guinea at 21 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> is the Extent of that:
Now then if we ſhould continue to value our Gold
above this Proportion, our New Money would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
be ſent away as faſt as it comes out of the
Mint to buy more Gold, where it can be done to
profit: And I can aſſure you, that at this time
ſomewhat leſs than ſour of our New Crowns, and
two Shillings, will buy a Guinea in <hi>Holland;</hi> and
is it not plain then that theſe People will continue
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103609:5"/>
this Trade as long as they can get profit by it, and
that when Gold is reduced to its true value, their

            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>But if we rais'd our Silver in proportion
to the Gold, they could not then make Profit in
ſending it abroad to buy Gold.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>That's true, <hi>Sir,</hi> but we ſhould by that

Miſchiefs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>How can that be? for if we are content
to take it ſo amongſt our ſelves, and could buy
the ſame quantity of Proviſions or Cloathing as we
do now for 30 <hi>s.</hi> when five Crowns were made
to paſs for 30 <hi>s.</hi> where's the harm on't?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>If it were to be imagined, that we could
be entirely ſeparated from the reſt of the World,
and ſhould have nothing to do with other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
it might do well enough; but as we are People
as largely concerned in Trade and Commerce as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
any other, we muſt have regard to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in this Matter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Sir, I am told that the price of Silver is
riſen amongſt all our Neighbour Countries.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>How d'ye mean riſen, Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>That our Crown is really worth 6 <hi>s.</hi> or more,
of their Money.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Which is downright Non-ſence; You'll
pardon me, Sir, I intend no reflection upon you
but upon the abſurdity of the Notion, and the Broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of it, being ſorry to ſee how much it hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
upon many honeſt Gentlemen, who are not
acquainted with Forreign Affairs; and I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
you of the inconſiſtency of it, by undeniable
arguments. You muſt know then, that there is no
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103609:6"/>
ſuch thing as ſix pounds, ſix ſhillings, or ſix-pence,
(underſtanding the ſame value by it as we do) in
any part of the World, but under the Engliſh Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.
The <hi>French</hi> make their computation by
Livres, Sols and Deniers, the <hi>Dutch</hi> by Guilders,
Stivers and Groots; in like manner all other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
have Denominations, or Valuations for
their Money, peculiar to themſelves: Now theſe are
only as Forreign Languages, not underſtood but by
ſuch as are converſant in them; but People that are
concern'd in Forreign Trade ſoon come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
this Money Language, and are able as it were
to tranſlate it into the Language of their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey;
ſo that if one Engliſh Man would ask ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that is a Trader, what a French Crown was
wont to paſs at in <hi>France?</hi> he would be apt to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
him according to his Underſtanding in <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
that it paſs'd for 4 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> becauſe the ſilver in ſuch
a piece is worth neareſt that Value in our Coin, yet the
moſt proper anſwer would be, that it paſſes for three
Livers, or ſixty Sols, but then that would have been
all Forreign Language, and unintelligible to him:
In like manner an Inhabitant of <hi>France</hi> would be as
much puzled, if you ſhould tell him that an Engliſh
Crown paſſes for 5 <hi>s.</hi> but if you tell him 'tis worth 3
Livers and 6 Sols, he underſtands you preſently, and
'tis after this manner that the Miſtake of calling the
Coins of one Country after the Denomination of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is introduc'd. But now you'll readily agree with
me, that if the French King ſhould raiſe the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of his Crown, and cauſe it to paſs among
his own People for 4 Livers, we ſhould ſtill eſteem
it worth no more than 4 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> as we did before,
becauſe it had nothing added to its former weight
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103609:6"/>
of Silver; ſo that in reality the true value of Money
is only to be reckoned by the weight of the Silver
and Gold that it bears, and tis altogether needleſs
for us to trouble our Heads with the nice diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of extrinſic, intrinſic, and real Value, for it muſt
all be reſolv'd into this one Propoſition of Weight,
every Man's or Nation's Riches being truly to be
meaſured, according to the more or leſs weight of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
which they poſſeſs: And that I may give you
an infallible Demonſtration that ſilver is only a
ſtandard to its ſelf, and as ſuch, is not capable of
being rais'd or lower'd with reſpect to Forreigners:
If you ſhould carry an ounce of fine ſilver into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
in expectation of Profit, do you think that a
Dutch-man would give you an ounce of his fine ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and a penny weight more, for your encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to come again: You may certainly reſolve
your ſelf that no Nation is ſo fooliſh.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>This, Sir, ſeems ſo reaſonable, that I know
not how to argue againſt it, but yet we find it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in fact amongſt our ſelves; for your ſelf told
me juſt now, that ſilver had been riſen from 5 <hi>s. 8 d.</hi>
to 6 <hi>s. 9 d.</hi> and 7 <hi>s. per Ounce.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>You'll pleaſe to note, Sir, that I had the
Caution to ſay, that it could not riſe (in that ſence)
with reſpect to Forreigners; and yet I'll make it
as plain to you, that (excepting a ſmall matter)
ſilver is not really capable of riſing and falling amongſt
our ſelves; for this ſeeming and nominal Advance
upon it was indeed no advance at all, for you muſt
note, that he that bought ſilver at 7 <hi>s. per Ounce,</hi> was
to pay for't either in Guinea's at 30 <hi>s.</hi> (and in that
ſort of Payment his Ounce of ſilver was indeed
worth about 7 <hi>s. 3 d.</hi>) or in the clipt and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103609:7"/>
Money, of which perhaps the true value of what
was call'd 7 <hi>s.</hi> might not be 4 <hi>s.</hi> but you may aſſure
your ſelf, that none of theſe Buyers of ſilver would
give a new mill'd Crown and a 6 <hi>d.</hi> for an ounce
of ſilver, becauſe they know how to throw them
into the melting Pot, and bring out above the weight
of an ounce; and this Rule is ſo certain, that it
can never vary more than ſuch a Value, as People
will be content to give for ſilver when they have
occaſion to tranſport it, rather than incur the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the Law by melting down, or tranſporting
the currant Coin; and that difference (when our
currant Money was good) hath rarely been known
to be more than 3 <hi>d.</hi> or 4 <hi>d. per Ounce:</hi> If you ſhould
yet have the leaſt ſcruple, pray try whether you
can by any ſort of reaſoning perſwade your ſelf,
that an Ounce of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nncoyn'd Silver can have more
real Value in it than an Ounce of Silver of the ſame
fineneſs coyn'd into Money, as a late Ingenious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hath well obſerved.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I thank you, you have effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd
me in this poinr, the Matter is ſelf evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>Yet before I have quite done with this
Argument, I would ſhew you in what ſenſe Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
may be ſaid to riſe in its eſteem, and that is
only when any Countrey may be brought to ſuch
a want of it, as they muſt be content to part
with their Product or Manufactures for a leſs
weight of it than formerly, which if Riches is to
be reckon'd from the plenty of Gold and Silver, is
an infallible ſign that ſuch a Countrey is declin'd in
its Riches, and growing poor. But this is not
the caſe of our Neighbours the <hi>Dutch,</hi> with whom
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103609:7"/>
ſome People would have us think that ſilver is grown
dearer; for on the contrary, we rather give more
weight of ſilver for their Commodities than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly.
And this leads me on to ſhew you how, if
we ſhould be once reduc'd to a neceſſity of raiſing
the denomination of our Coin, it might be truly ſaid
of us, that we are not only grown poorer, but ſhould
be in a manner put out a of condition to recover ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
again; for however indifferent it might ſeem
to Countrey Gentlemen to ſubmit to the raiſing of
our Crown to paſs for 6 <hi>s.</hi> becauſe that 6 <hi>s.</hi> might
buy as much Proviſion or Cloathing as it would
when the Money was at the old weight, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſeems to be no inconvenience, if we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
amongſt our ſelves; yet the matter will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be far otherwiſe, when we come to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our ſelves as a Trading Nation, and that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Riches are no otherwiſe to be acquired but
by our Commerce with Forreigners; and to ſhew
you after what manner this advance of our Money
would affect us in that reſpect, I will ſuppoſe that
a Forreigner brings hither 20 Ounces of Silver, which
(to avoid Fractions) I will call 20 Crowns, or five
Pounds, and with this he buys 10 yards of our
Cloth: The next year he returns again with the
like quantity of Silver, and finds that we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
the Denomination of our Money, and will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him 6 <hi>l.</hi> for his 20 <hi>Ounces,</hi> ſo that he can then
have 12 Yards of the ſame ſort of Cloth for the
ſame weight of Silver, which the Year before bought
him but 10 Yards: Is it not plain that we hereby
give away, or loſe two Yards of Cloth in ten?
Or to put it the other way, will not this leſſen the
whole produce of our Nation with reſpect to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103609:8"/>
full one fifth part? altho' we muſt pay as
much Silver for all that we buy of them as we
now do. An unhappy Device: And ſure all Men
that love their Countrey, when they ſhall come thus
to underſtand it, will oppoſe ſuch a Deſign with all
their power. But I would have you conſider its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
a little further; as we compute the value
of our Eſtates by Money, the Man that hath an
Eſtate in Land, which would now ſell for 1200 <hi>l.</hi>
which I'll compute at 4800 Ounces of ſilver, if he
ſhould come to ſell it after the Money ſhould be ſo
advanc'd, will the Money he ſhould receive then,
altho' they call it 1200 <hi>l.</hi> weigh above 4000 Ounces?
he that hath 600 <hi>l.</hi> or 2400 <hi>Ounces per Ann.</hi> in
Leas'd Rents, will this New Money bring to his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
more than 2000 <hi>Ounces?</hi> and though he hath
600 <hi>l.</hi> in Name, hath he not certainly loſt a 100 <hi>l.</hi>
in value? Is not this a plain robbing the Landed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of one fifth part of his Eſtate or Subſtance?
In like manner, if a Man hath lent 120 <hi>l.</hi> or 480
<hi>Ounces</hi> at Intereſt, ſhould he receive any more than
400 <hi>Ounces</hi> of Silver for his 120 <hi>l.</hi> and would he not
utterly loſe the 80 <hi>Ounces?</hi> A Man that by his good
Husbandry us'd to lay up 60 <hi>l.</hi> or 240 <hi>Ounces</hi> of Silver
yearly, towards the encreaſing of his Eſtate, or rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Portions for his Children, muſt he not loſe the
6<hi>th.</hi> part of his Induſtry, when he ſhall come to have
but 200 <hi>Ounces,</hi> that is 40 <hi>Ounces</hi> of ſilver leſs than
his old 60 <hi>l.</hi> would have yielded him. In ſhort,
would it not be a lowering the whole value of all
the reſt of the Nation in that proportion, for no other
end but to advantage thoſe Men as much who had
large hoards of Money by them? But I ſhould not
omit to ſhew how it will touch the Publick: If the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103609:8"/>
King hath now occaſion to uſe two Millions yearly
abroad for the payment of the Army, the Fleet in the
<hi>Streights,</hi> and providing Naval Stores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when the
Money ſhould be thus rais'd, and would weigh one
ſixth part leſs, will Forreigners think you abate him
one Ounce of the Old Weight of what he ſhall ſend
in Silver? And will not the Merchant that furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
him with Bills have as much more Money in Tale
as will make good the old weight, becauſe he muſt
pay by that weight abroad? And is it not then
plain, that this part of the King's Money will fall
ſhort by one third part of a Million? and muſt not
this naturally heighten the next Years Tax? Thus
then it muſt affect us at home, and I think I need
uſe no more words to ſhew you that Forreigners do
not at all regard the raiſing the Denominations of
the Coyn of their Neighbours, and will never e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
it otherwiſe than by its weight; for which
reaſon 'tis a great Folly to think, if (as is before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid)
we ſhall continue to have occaſion to uſe
more Money in Forreign Countreys than we can
put there by the produce of our Trade, that we can
avoid ſending ſo much Silver or Gold as will make
up the Ballance in its Value by weight, although
we ſhould double or trebble the Denomination of
our Coyn amongſt our ſelves.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>But, Sir, as you have grounded the main
of the Argument upon a ſuppoſition that our Goods
would continue to be bought for the ſame number
of Pounds, Shillings and Pence, as before the raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Money; ſuppoſe we raiſe our Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
proportionably, and make the Stranger pay
12 <hi>s.</hi> for a Yard of the ſame Cloath he bought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for 10 <hi>s.</hi> ſhall we not then keep up our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103609:9"/>
abroad, and bring home as much Silver for
our Manufactures as before? and would not all
things run as ſmooth at home, when we ſold eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing from one to another as much higher in
Price as the difference of the Money?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>What good would it then do us to raiſe
the Denomination of our Money, if we muſt then
give juſt ſo much more for every thing we buy?
is not this puzling our ſelves to no purpoſe, if it
ſhould have no worſe effect? But I thought I had
ſhewn you clearly, that all our Debts, the Rents
ariſing from Lands leaſs'd out, the King's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> would then be paid in ſo much a leſs
proportion of Silver, and then the King, Creditors
and Land-holders will be in a fine Condition, when
they muſt receive all that is due to them in a leſſer
Value, and yet pay the old value for all they buy;
would not this be plainly the doing a great deal of
Injuſtice and Injury to a great many, and doing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
good to none? But yet I'll tell you, Sir, 'tis my
Opinion that it would be more likely that our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and Manufactures would by degrees fall to the
old Denominations of Price, for that I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
it to have had that conſequence in other
Nations, where this Trick of raiſing their Money
hath been practis'd; and ſhall we not then infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
fall under the Miſchief of Beggering our ſelves,
as I have formerly ſhewn you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>I muſt confeſs this raiſing our Money doth
ſeem to be attended with many inconveniencies,
with reſpect to our ſelves, but I have been told the
Nation is greatly in debt to Forreigners, who would be
apt to carry away our New Money, as faſt as coin'd, to
pay themſelves, ſhould we not by this means prevent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103609:9"/>
them, and by paying our Debts with leſs Money
ſave ſo much to the Nation?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>If we are in debt to Forreigners, we are
doubtleſs obliged to them for the Credit they have
given us, and ought we not in prudence as well as
Juſtice to be tender in preſerving that Credit, leaſt
if we ſhould ever hereafter have the like Occaſion,
we ſhould find no Nation that would truſt us.
Doubtleſs it ought to be the greateſt Care of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
to prevent as much as poſſible the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into Debt, but if ſuch Debts are once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
it highly concerns them that they be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd
punctually, juſtly and honourably, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they looſe their Reputation with all the World,
as a great Nation that might be named hath too
apparently done. 'Tis not to be doubted that ſome
Forreigners have been large Contributors towards
the great Summs that have been paid into our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer
upon the <hi>Million Adventure,</hi> the Lives, and
other Funds, and all that Money was paid in fair
and true value, before the Cheat of Guinea's, and
the advancing the Exchanges: Neither can theſe
People withdraw this Money, as is ſuggeſted, for
they can only receive the Intereſt accrewing by it,
as it comes in gradually. Can any Man then that
hath the leaſt regard to Juſtice and Honour enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſo baſe a thought as to perſwade the breaking
through the Sanction of our Acts of Parliament,
and the falſifying our Contracts, that we might
pay theſe People in Money of a leſs Value than
they really brought us? I muſt indeed confeſs that
our Nation hath been greatly abus'd by the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Gold, and the Extravagance of the Exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
this laſt Summer, but I am much of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103609:10"/>
that thoſe Traders kept turning the Penny,
and continually ſent Effects for the carrying on the
Trade: So that I hope though it coſt us dear, yet
that we cannot remain much in debt for that. And
to ſpeak my Mind, I believe, if the Truth were
known, that Trade was chiefly managed for the
account of Natives of our own Countrey, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
that live amongſt us, and not of the other
ſide of the Water. And though I will not argue
againſt our taking Satisfaction of the Perſons that
have injured us, yet I think we were better let
them alone 'till we can find them out, than ſeek
ſuch a general Revenge that may fall leaſt upon
them, and do more hurt to thoſe kind Neighbours that
have done us good by truſting us with their Eſtates,
and moſt of all to our ſelves, by plunging us into thoſe
fatal Miſchiefs, which I have before noted.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, I muſt acknowledge, that you have very
much opened my Underſtanding in theſe things, and I
am now fully convinc'd, that 'twould be ruinous to us
to raiſe our ſilver, and no leſs to hold up Guinea's
higher than 21 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> if that be, as you ſay, about
the proportion that other Countries keep between
them. But pray, Sir, is there then no way for us to
keep our Army abroad, and avoid the ſending out
of our Silver or Gold to maintain them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>If we could furniſh our Army with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of the Proviſions they need abroad, protect our
Forreign Trade, leſſen our Expence of Forreign Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
(which I would earneſtly recommend
to all Gentlemen to reform as much as poſſible in
their own Families) and manage all our Affairs with
ſuch good Husbandry, as to bring all our Forreign
Charge within the compaſs of the Value which we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103609:10"/>
can put into Forreign Countries by the exportation
of our Merchandizes, we might do it, otherwiſe 'tis
impoſſible. For the whole Matter of bringing ſilver
into the Kingdom, or carrying it out, may be reſolv'd
by this eaſie thought, if we live within the Bounds
of our Exports, we cannot ſend out our Money un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we will give it away for nothing; but if we
ſpend more than we export in Goods, we muſt ſend
out our ſilver as long as we have any, becauſe
Forreigners will not furniſh us with what we want
longer than we pay them to the full.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Gent.</speaker>
               <p>But now, Sir, ſince the Guinea's are ſo largely
diſpers'd into the Hands of the Common People thro'
the Nation, will it not be very hard upon them to bear
ſo great a loſs? and may it not be reaſonable for the
Parliament to give a recompenſe for this loſs?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Merch.</speaker>
               <p>I would have all the Tenderneſs poſſible for
the People, but if they will fooliſhly run themſelves
into a loſs that they had warning to have avoided,
ſeeing the King's Receivers did all along refuſe to
take them at the advance, they are the leſs to be
pitied; and 'twas their eaſie giving way to it that
made it poſſible for the ill Men that contriv'd it to
put this abuſe upon the Nation; whereas if all had
been of my Opinion, (not to diſtinguiſh my ſelf from
many others who were always of the ſame Mind)
they would never have made them paſs currant for
23 <hi>s.</hi> for 'twas long before I would take any, and
never after but when I knew where to put them
away again preſently. I could wiſh indeed that the
Perſons who invented and promoted this Trade could
be found out, and made to repair the loſs ſo far as
they were able; and it being ſaid the Parliament
are paſſing an Act, by which they will appoint
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103609:11"/>
Commiſſioners to be named through the Kingdom,
who ſhall take in all the clipt and ſilver Money, though
of a baſer allay, (which hath not been paid into the
King for Taxes) and give the People broad or
new Money in Exchange for it, I think every one
is much to blame who will not rather chooſe to
take what is due to him in any ſort of ſilver Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
by which he cannot loſe, than in Guinea's at
the preſent rates, becauſe he may well expect to loſe
whatſoever he takes them at above 21 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> And
upon theſe Conſiderations there may be good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to believe that the Parliament will not at this
time lay an Additional Tax upon the Nation to
make good the deficiency of Guinea's, which the
People that have them have brought upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
when they find ſo much difficulty to raiſe
Money enough to ſupply the unavoidable neceſſity
of the Government. And I muſt farther give you
my Opinion, that I think the People in whoſe hands
they now are, may beſt bear the loſs: For as to
the meaner ſort of People, their ſtock ſeldom reaches
ſo high as to be Poſſeſſors of Guinea's; the middle
ſort of People, ſuch as Farmers or Tradeſmen, have
commonly as much occaſion to pay as receive, and
therefore it muſt be a fault in them if they have
many upon their hands, and what loſs may befall
them they may the more contentedly bear, becauſe
'tis not to be doubted but that, (generally ſpeaking)
they have gotten more by the raiſing the prices
of their Goods in conſideration of ſuch pay. The
greateſt Quantities then I ſhould think to be now
in the Hands either of ſuch who have kept them
out of a Covetous Deſign of gaining by them, through
a ſend imagination that they would riſe to 35 <hi>s.</hi> or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103609:11"/>
more, by the ſcarcity of the Silver Money, whilſt it
was paſſing through the Mint; or of ſuch who have
been the Traders in them, neither of which deſerve
Conſideration.</p>

               <p>But pray Sir, have we not indeed reaſon
to fear that we ſhall not have Money to anſwer
our Neceſſary Payments whilſt the ſilver is in coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>

               <p>Truly, Sir, I can have no ſuch fearful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of it, for there's nothing to hinder any
Man from keeping the poſſeſſion of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Caſh, till he can change it for better, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all People that have now Money enough to
ſerve their Occaſions, will have no need to want;
the Bills and the Guinea's (which will circulate
quicker than before, when the ſhall paſs at 21 <hi>s.
6 d.</hi> and no body fear to loſe by them) will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
as they have for ſome Months paſt, to ſupply
us in the larger Payments; and for Market-money
Labourers Wages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a ſmall Quantity will ſerve
that occaſion, it being always in Motion; ſo that
there's not the leaſt reaſon to doubt but that enough
of the preſent Money will be kept for that uſe, 'till
better comes out to change it.</p>

               <p>I heartily thank you for the great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>I ſhall be very glad, Sir, if I have been able
to make you ſo far Maſter of the Argument, as that
you can convince your Neighbours, that there is a
Neceſſity for the falling of Guinea's, if we ever
deſire to ſee the New Money plenty amongſt us, and
that they were better contentedly to ſubmit to the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103609:12"/>
loſs which will befall them when they have but ten,
than to be ſubject to the greater loſs which they muſt
bear, if through the importation of greater quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
they ſhould come to be Poſſeſſors of fifteen; as
alſo, that the raiſing the denomination of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
muſt have a direct tendency to begger the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
