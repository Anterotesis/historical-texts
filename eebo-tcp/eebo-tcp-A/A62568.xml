            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHen I had perform'd the Service
which you were pleas'd to call me
to in the preaching of this Sermon, I had
no thoughts of making it more publique.
And yet in this also I was the more easily
induced to comply with your desire, because
of the suitableness of the Argument to the
Age in which we live: Wherein as men
have run into the wildest extremities in other
things, so particularly in the matter of Oaths;
some making conscience of taking any Oath at
all, and too many none at all of breaking them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51556:3"/>
To convince the great mistake of the one
extreme, and to check the growing evil and
mischief of the other, is the chief design of
this Discourse. To which I shall be very
glad if by God's blessing it may prove any
wise serviceable. I am</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE necessity of Religion to the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of humane Society in nothing
appears more evidently than in this, That the
obligation of an Oath, which is so necessary
for the maintenance of peace and justice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51556:4"/>
men, depends wholly upon the sense
and belief of a Deity. For no reason can be
imagined why any man that doth not believe
a God, should make the least conscience of an
Oath; which is nothing else but a solemn ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to God as a witness of the truth of what
we say. So that whoever promotes Atheism
and Infidelity doth the most destructive thing
imaginable to humane Society, because he
takes away the reverence and obligation of
Oaths: And whenever that is generally cast
off, humane Society must disband, and all
things run into disorder. The just sense
whereof made <hi>David</hi> cry out to God with so
much earnestness, as if the World had been
cracking, and the frame of it ready to break
in pieces, <hi>Psal. 12. Help, Lord, for the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man ceaseth, and the faithfull fail from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the children of men:</hi> Intimating, That
when Faith fails from among men, nothing
but a particular and immediate interposition of
the Divine providence can preserve the World
from falling into confusion. And our Blessed
Saviour gives this as a sign of the end of the
World, and the approaching dissolution of all
things, when faith and truth shall hardly be
found among men, <hi>Luke 18. 8. When the Son of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:51556:4"/>
man comes, shall he find Faith on the earth?</hi> This
state of things doth loudly call for his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to destroy the World, which is even
ready to dissolve and fall in pieces of it self,
when these Bands and Pillars of humane Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
do break and fail. And surely never in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Age was this Sign of the coming of the
Son of man more glaring and terrible than in
this degenerate Age wherein we live, when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all sorts of men seem to have broke loose
from all obligations to faith and truth.</p>
            <p>And therefore I do not know any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more proper and usefull to be treated of
upon this Occasion than of the Nature and
Obligation of an <hi>Oath,</hi> which is the utmost
security that one man can give to another, of
the truth of what he saies; the strongest tye of
fidelity, the surest ground of Judicial procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,
and the most firm and sacred bond that
can be laid upon all that are concerned in the
administration of publick Justice; upon <hi>Judge,</hi>
and <hi>Jury,</hi> and <hi>Witnesses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for this reason I have pitched upon
these Words; In which the Apostle declares to
us the great use and necessity of Oaths a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men; <hi>An Oath for confirmation is to them
an end of all strife.</hi> He had said before, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51556:5"/>
for our greater assurance and comfort God hath
confirmed his promises to us by an Oath; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending
herein to deal with us after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of men, who, when they would give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
to a doubtfull matter, confirm what they
say by an Oath. And generally when any
doubt or controversie ariseth between Parties
concerning a matter of fact, one side affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and the other denying, an end is put
to this contest by an Oath; <hi>An Oath for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
being to them an end of all strife: An
Oath for confirmation,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for the greater
assurance and establishment of a thing: Not,
that an Oath is alwaies a certain and infallible
decision of things according to truth and
right; but, that this is the utmost credit that
we can give to any thing, and the last resort
of truth and confidence among men: After
this we can go no farther; for if the Religion
of an Oath will not oblige men to speak truth,
nothing will. This is the utmost security that
men can give, and must therefore be the final
decision of all contests; <hi>An Oath for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
is to them an end of all strife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from this assertion of the Apostle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the great use and end of Oaths among
men, I shall take occasion,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:51556:5"/>
1. To consider the <hi>nature</hi> of an Oath, and
the <hi>kinds</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>2. To shew the great <hi>use</hi> and even <hi>necessity</hi>
of Oaths, in many cases.</p>
            <p>3. To vindicate the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of them,
where they are necessary.</p>
            <p>4. To shew the sacred <hi>obligation</hi> of an Oath.
I shall be as brief in these as the just handling of
them will bear.</p>
            <p>1. For the <hi>nature</hi> of an Oath, and the <hi>kinds</hi>
of it. An <hi>Oath</hi> is <hi>an invocation of God, or an
appeal to him as a witness of the truth of what we
say.</hi> So that an Oath is a sacred thing, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an act of Religion and an invocation of
the Name of God: And this, whether the
Name of God be expresly mentioned in it or
not. If a man only say, <hi>I swear,</hi> or <hi>I take my
Oath,</hi> that a thing is, or is not, so, or so; or that
I will, or will not, do such a thing: Or if a man
<hi>answer upon his Oath,</hi> being adjured and required
so to do: Or if a man <hi>swear by Heaven, or by
Earth,</hi> or by any other thing that hath relation
to God; in all these cases a man doth virtually
call God to witness; and in so doing, he doth by
consequence invoke him as a Judge and an
Avenger, in case what he swears be not true.
And if this be exprest, the oath is a formall Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51556:6"/>
but whether it be, or not, a curse
upon our selves is always implyed in case of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
            <p>There are <hi>two</hi> sorts of Oaths, <hi>Assertory,</hi> and
<hi>Promissory.</hi> An <hi>assertory</hi> oath is when a man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
or denies upon oath a matter of fact, past,
or present: when he swears that a thing was, or
is so, or not so. A <hi>promissory</hi> oath is a promise
confirmed by an oath, which always respects
something that is future: And if the promise
be made directly and immediately to <hi>God,</hi> then
it is call'd a <hi>Vow;</hi> if to <hi>men,</hi> an <hi>Oath.</hi> I proceed
to the</p>
            <p>II. Thing, which is to shew the great <hi>use</hi>
and even <hi>necessity</hi> of Oaths, in many cases:
Which is so great, that humane Society can
very hardly, if at all, subsist long without them.
Government would many times be very inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure:
And for the faithfull discharge of Offices
of great trust, in which the welfare of the
Publick is nearly concerned, it is not possible to
find any security equall to that of an Oath; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the obligation of that reacheth to the most
secret and hidden practices of men, and takes
hold of them in many cases where the penalty
of no humane Law can have any awe or force
upon them: And especially, it is (as the <hi>Civil
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51556:6"/>
Law</hi> expresseth it) <hi>maximum expediendarum li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium
remedium,</hi> the best means of ending con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies:
And where mens estates or lives are
concerned, no evidence but what is assured by
an Oath will be thought sufficient to decide the
matter, so as to give full and generall satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to mankind. For in matters of so great
concernment, when men have all the assurance
that can be had, and not till then, they are
contented to sit down and rest satisfied with it.
And among all Nations an Oath hath always
been thought the onely permptory and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
way of deciding such controversies.</p>
            <p>III. The <hi>third</hi> thing I proposed, was to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of Oaths, where they are
necessary. And it is a very strong inducement
to believe the lawfulness of them, that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable
condition of humane affairs hath
made them so necessary. The Apostle takes it
for granted that an Oath is not only of great
use in humane affairs, but in many cases of
great necessity, to confirm a doubtful thing,
and to put an end to controversies, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
otherwise be decided to the satisfaction of
the Parties contending; <hi>An oath for confirmation
is to them an end of all strife.</hi> And indeed it is
hardly imaginable that God should not have
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51556:7"/>
left that lawfull, which is so evidently necessary
to the peace and security of Mankind.</p>
            <p>But because there is a <hi>Sect,</hi> sprung up in our
memory, which hath called in question the
lawfullness of all Oaths, to the great mischief
and disturbance of humane Society, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to search this matter to the bottom,
and to manifest how unreasonable and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
this Opinion is. And to this end, I shall</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> prove the lawfulness of Oaths from
the authority of this Text, and from the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
plainly contained, or strongly implied
in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall shew the weakness and insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of the grounds of the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
whether from reason, or from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which last they principally rely upon; and
if it could be made out from thence would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the case.</p>
            <p>1. I shall prove the lawfulness of Oaths from
the authority of this Text, and the reasons plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contained, or strongly implyed in it. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Apostle doth not only speak of the
use of Oaths among men without any manner
of censure and reproof, but as a commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
custome and practice, and in many cases
necessary, for the confirmation of doubtfull
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51556:7"/>
matters, and in order to the finall decision of
Controversies and Differences among men. For</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> He speakes of it as the generall practice
of Mankind, to confirm things by an oath in
order to the ending of differences. And indeed
there is nothing that hath more universally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in all Ages and Nations of the World:
than which there is not a more certain indication
that a thing is agreeable to the Law of Nature
and the best Reason of Mankind. And that
this was no degenerate practice of Mankind,
like that of Idolatry, is from hence evident;
that when God separated a People to himself,
it was practised among them, by the holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs,
<hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and was
afterwards not only allowed, but in many Cases
commanded by the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> which had
it been a thing evil in it self and forbidden by
the Law of Nature, would not have been done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> Another undeniable Argument from
the Text of the Lawfulness of Oaths is, that
God himself, in condescension to the Custome
of men who use to confirm and give credit to
what they say by an Oath, is represented by the
Apostle as confirming his promise to us by an
oath, vers. 13. <hi>When God made the promise to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
because he could swear by none greater, he
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51556:8"/>
swears by himself. For men verily swear by the
greater; and an oath for confirmation is to them
an end of all strife. Wherein God, willing more
abundantly to shew unto the heirs of promise the
immutability of his counsell, confirmed it by an
oath:</hi> which he certainly would not have done,
had an oath been unlawfull in it self. For that
had been to comply with men in an evil prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
and by his own example to give counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to it in the highest manner: But though
God condescend to represent himself to us
after the manner of men, he never do's it in
any thing that is in it's own nature evil and
sinfull.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> From the great Usefullness of Oaths
in humane affaires, to give credit and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
to our word, and to put an end to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testations.
Now that which serves to such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
purposes, and is so convenient for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
society, and for mutual security and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
among men, ought not easily to be
presumed unlawfull, till it be plainly proved
to be so. And if we consider the nature of an
oath, and every thing belonging to it, there is
nothing that hath the least appearance of evil
in it. There is surely no evil in it, as it is an
act of religion; nor as it is an Appeal to God
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51556:8"/>
as a witness and avenger in case we swear falsly;
nor as it is a confirmation of a doubtfull mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
nor as it puts an end to strife and contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versy.
And these are all the essential ingredients
of an Oath, and the ends of it; and they are all so
good, that they rather commend it, than give
the least colour of ground to condemn it. I
proceed in the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2d.</hi> Place, to shew the weakness and insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of the grounds of the contrary opinion;
whether from <hi>Reason,</hi> or from <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> from <hi>Reason.</hi> They say the necessity
of an Oath is occasioned by the want of truth
and fidelity among men. And that every man
ought to demean himself with that faithfulness
and integrity as may give credit and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his word; and then Oaths will be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
This pretence will be fully answered, if
we consider these <hi>two</hi> things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> That in matters of great importance no
other obligation, besides that of an oath, hath
been thought sufficient amongst the best and
wisest of men to assert their fidelity to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Even the best men</hi> (to use the words of
a great Author) <hi>have not trusted the best men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it.</hi> As we see in very remarkable instances,
where Oaths have pass'd between those who
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51556:9"/>
might be thought to have the greatest confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in one another: As between <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his old faithfull servant <hi>Eliezer,</hi> concerning the
choice of a Wise for his Son: Between Father
and Son, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joseph,</hi> concerning the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
of his Father in the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two of the dearest and most intimate
Friends, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> to assure their
friendship to one another; and it had its effect
long after <hi>Jonathan</hi>'s death in the saving of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phibosheth,</hi>
when reason of State and the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of his Throne seem'd to move <hi>David</hi> strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the contrary; for it is expresly said 2 <hi>Sam.
21.</hi> 7. that <hi>David</hi> spared <hi>Mephibosheth, Jonathan</hi>'s
<hi>Son, because of the oath of the Lord that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them;</hi> implying, that had it not been for
his Oath, other considerations might probably
have prevail'd with him to have permitted him
to have been cut off with the rest of <hi>Saul</hi>'s
Children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> This Reason, which is alledged against
Oaths among men, is much stronger against
God's confirming his promises to us by an Oath.
For he who is Truth it self is surely of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
most to be credited upon his bare word,
and his oath needless to give confirmation to it;
and yet he condescends to add his oath to his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51556:9"/>
word; and therefore that reason is evidently of
no force.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> from <hi>Scripture.</hi> Our Saviour seems
altogether to forbid swearing in any case, <hi>Matth.
5. 33, 34. Ye have heard that it hath been said to
them of old time, thou shalt not forswear thy self: but
I say unto you swear not at all; neither by heaven,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>But let your communication be yea, yea, and nay, nay;
for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.</hi> And
this Law St. <hi>James</hi> recites, <hi>chap. 5. ver.</hi> 12. as that
which Christians ought to have a very particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
and principal regard to; <hi>above all things my
Brethren swear not:</hi> And he makes the breach of
this Law a damning sin, <hi>least ye fall into Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
But the Authority of our Saviour alone
is sufficient, and therefore I shall only consider
that Text.</p>
            <p>And, because here lyes the main strength of
this opinion of the unlawfulness of Oaths, it is
very fit that this Text be fully consider'd; and that
it be made very evident, that it was not our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
meaning by this prohibition wholly to
forbid the use of Oaths.</p>
            <p>But before I enter upon this matter, I will
readily grant, that there is scarce any Errour
whatsoever that hath a more plausible colour
from Scripture, than this; which makes the case
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51556:10"/>
of those who are seduced into it the more pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
But then it ought to be consider'd, how
much this Doctrine of the unlawfulness of oaths
reflects upon the Christian Religion; since it is
so evidently prejudiciall both to humane Society
in generall, and particularly to those persons that
entertain it: neither of which ought rashly to be
supposed and taken for granted, concerning any
Law delivered by our Saviour: Because upon these
terms it will be very hard for us to vindicate the
divine wisdom of our Saviour's Doctrine, and
the Reasonableness of the Christian Religion.
Of the inconvenience of this Doctrine to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Society, I have spoken already. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this, it is very prejudicial to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it. It renders them suspected to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and in many cases incapable of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
benefits of Justice and other priviledges of
humane Society, and exposeth them to great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties,
as the constitution of all Laws and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments
at present is; and it is not easy to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
how they should be otherwise. And which
is very considerable in this matter, it sets those
who refuse Oaths upon very unequall terms
with the rest of Mankind, if where the estates
and lives of men are equally concern'd, their
bare testimonies shall be admitted without an
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51556:10"/>
Oath, and others shall be obliged to speak upon
Oath: Nothing being more certain in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
than that many men will lye for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
when they will not be perjured; God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
planted in the natural Consciences of men
a secret dread of perjury above most other
sins. And this inconvenience is so great, as to
render those who refuse oaths in all cases almost
intolerable to humane Society. I speak not this ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to bring them into trouble, or to perswade
them to measure truth by their interest: But
on the other hand I must needs say, that it is no
Argument either of a wise or good man to take
up any opinion, especially such a one as is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his prejudice upon slight grounds. And
this very consideration, that it is so much to
their inconvenience, may justly move them to
be very carefull in the examination of it.</p>
            <p>This being premis'd, I come now to explain
this Prohibition of our Saviour; and to this
purpose, I desire these <hi>three</hi> things may be well
consider'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That severall circumstances of these
words of our Saviour do manifestly shew that
they ought to be interpreted in a limited sense,
as only forbidding swearing in common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation;
<hi>needless</hi> and <hi>heedless</hi> oaths (as one
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51556:11"/>
expresseth it) and in general, all voluntary
swearing, unless upon some great and weighty
cause, in which the glory of God and the good
of the souls of Men is concerned. For that in
such cases a voluntary oath may be lawfull, I
am induced to believe from the example of
St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who useth it more than once upon such
occasions; of which I shall hereafter give par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
instances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And this was the sense of Wise men among
the</hi> Heathens, <hi>that men should not swear but
upon necessity and great occasion. Thus</hi> Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius
<hi>the Philosopher in</hi> Stobaeus, <hi>counsels men.</hi>
Some <hi>(says he)</hi> advise men to be carefull to swear
the truth; but I advise principally that men do not
easily swear at all, <hi>that is, not upon any slight, but
only upon weighty occasions: To the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi>
Epictetus, Shun oaths wholly, if it be possible; if
not, however as much as thou canst: <hi>And so likewise</hi>
Simplicius <hi>in his</hi> Comment <hi>upon him,</hi> We ought
wholly to shun swearing, except upon occasions of great
necessity: <hi>And</hi> Quintilian <hi>among the</hi> Romans,
In totum jurare, nisi ubi necesse est, gravi viro pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
convenit; To swear at all, except where it is
necessary, do's not well suite with a wise man.</p>
            <p>And, that this Prohibition of our Saviour's
ought to be understood of oaths in ordinary
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51556:11"/>
conversation, appears from the opposition which
our Saviour makes, <hi>Swear not at all; but let
your communication be yea, yea;</hi> That is, in your
ordinary commerce and affairs do not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
oaths, but say and do. And this is very
much confirmed, in that our Saviour do's not
under this general Prohibition, instance in such
oaths as are expresly by the name of God: The
reason whereof is this; The <hi>Jews</hi> thought it
unlawfull in ordinary communication to swear
expresly by the name of God, but lawfull to
swear by the Creatures, as by <hi>Heaven</hi> and
<hi>Earth,</hi> &amp;c. So that our Saviour's meaning is,
as if he had said; You think you may swear in
common conversation, provided you do not
swear by the name of God; but I say unto
you, let your communication be without oaths
of any kind: you shall not so much as swear by
<hi>heaven</hi> or by <hi>earth,</hi> because God is virtually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
in every oath. And unless we suppose this
to be our Saviour's meaning, I do not see what
good Reason can be given why our Saviour
should only forbid them to swear by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and not much rather by the Name of God;
such oaths being surely of all others most to be
avoided, as being the most direct abuse and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanation
of the Name of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:51556:12"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is very considerable to the explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this Prohibition, that there are the like
general expressions in other <hi>Jewish</hi> Authours
concerning this very matter, which yet must
of necessity be thus limited. <hi>Maimonides,</hi> from
the ancient <hi>Rabbies,</hi> gives this Rule, that <hi>it is
best not to swear at all.</hi> And <hi>Philo</hi> useth almost the
same words. And <hi>Rabbi Jonathan</hi> comes very
near our Saviour's expression, when he says, <hi>The
just man will not swear at all; not so much as by the
common Names of God, nor by his Attributes, nor by
his Works, as by Heaven, or the Angels, or the Law.</hi>
Now it is not imaginable, that these learned
<hi>Jewes</hi> should condemn Oaths in all cases, when
the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> did in many cases expresly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
them. And therefore they are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
of voluntary oaths in ordinary conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
And that the <hi>Jewes</hi> meant this by not swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at all, seems to be very plain from a passage
in <hi>Josephus,</hi> who says that the <hi>Sect</hi> of the <hi>Essenes</hi>
forbad their Disciples to swear at all; and yet
he tells us at the same time, that they who were
admitted into that <hi>Sect,</hi> took an oath to observe
the Laws and Rules of it. So that they who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad
to swear at all, allowed of Oaths imposed
by the Authority of Superiours.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> which will peremptorily decide this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51556:12"/>
matter, this Prohibition of our Saviour's cannot
be understood to forbid all Oaths, without a
plain contradiction to the undoubted practice
of the primitive Christians, and of the Apostles,
and even of our Lord himself. <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
tell us, that the Christians refused to
swear by the Emperour's <hi>Genius;</hi> not because it
was an Oath, but because they thought it to be
Idolatrous: But the same <hi>Tertullian</hi> says, that
the Christians were willing to swear <hi>per salutem
Imperatoris, by the health and safety of the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.
Athanasius,</hi> being accused to <hi>Constantius,</hi>
purged himself by oath, and desired that his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser
might be put to his Oath, <hi>sub attestatione
veritatis, by calling the truth to witness:</hi> by which
form (says he) <hi>we Christians are wont to swear.</hi> But,
which is more than this, St. <hi>Paul,</hi> upon weighty
occasions, do's severall times in his <hi>Epistles</hi> call
God to witness for the truth of what he says;
which is the very formality of an Oath. <hi>God is
my witness, Rom. 1. 9. As God is true, our word was
not yea and nay, 2 Cor.</hi> 1. 18. and <hi>v. 23. I call God
for a record upon my Soul. Before God I lye not, Gal.
1. 20. God is my record, Philip. 1. 8. God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
1 Thess.</hi> 2. 5. These are all unquestionable
oaths; which we cannot imagine St. <hi>Paul</hi> would
have used, had they been directly contrary
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51556:13"/>
to our Saviour's Law. And whereas some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
this upon account of his extraordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,
I cannot possibly see how this mends
the matter. For surely it is very inconvenient
to say that they who were to teach the Precepts
of Christ to others, did themselves break them
by Inspiration.</p>
            <p>But I go yet farther, and shall urge an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
beyond all exception.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour himself (who surely would not
be the first example of breaking his own Laws)
did not refuse to answer upon Oath, being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
thereto at his Tryall. So we find <hi>Matth. 26.
63. The high Priest said unto him, I adjure thee by the
living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ
the Son of God;</hi> that is, he required him to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
this question upon Oath. For among the
<hi>Jewes,</hi> the form of giving an oath to witnesses
and others, was not by tendering a formal oath
to them, as the custome is among us; but by
adjuring them, that is, requiring them to answer
upon oath: As is plain from <hi>Levit. 5. 1. If a man
hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness whether
he hath seen or known of such a thing, if he do not
utter it, then he shall bear his Iniquity. If he have
heard the voice of swearing,</hi> that is, if being adju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
or demanded to answer upon oath, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51556:13"/>
what he hath seen or heard, he do not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the truth, he is perjured. Now to this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration
of the high Priest, our Saviour answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>thou hast said:</hi> which words are not an avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to answer (as some have thought) but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
answer; as if he had said, <hi>it is as thou sayest;
it is even so, I am the Son of God.</hi> For upon this
answer the high Priest said, <hi>he hath spoken blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy.</hi>
But, to put the matter beyond all doubt,
St. <hi>Mark</hi> tells us, <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 61. that he being asked
by the high Priest, <hi>Art thou the Christ the Son of
the Blessed? He answered, I am.</hi> So that unless we
will interpret our Saviour's Doctrine contrary
to his own practice, we cannot understand him
to forbid all Oaths; and consequently they are
not unlawfull.</p>
            <p>I have been the longer upon this, that I might
give clear satisfaction in this matter to those that
are willing to receive it.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in use among us in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of Oaths, it is no just Exception against them,
that they are not found in Scripture. For this
was always matter of Liberty; and several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
have used several Rites and Ceremonies in
their Oaths. It was the custome of the <hi>Graecians,</hi>
to swear laying their hands upon the Altar, <hi>quod
sanctissimum jusjurandum est habitum,</hi> (saith <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51556:14"/>
which was looked upon as the most sacred form
of Swearing.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> were wont <hi>Jovem La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidem
jurare;</hi> that is, he that swore by <hi>Jupiter</hi>
held a Flint-stone in his hand, and flung it vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
from him, with these words, <hi>Si sciens fallo
ita me Jupiter bonis omnibus ejiciat ut ego hunc La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidem;
If I knowingly falsify, God so throw me out
of all my possessions as I do this stone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Scripture</hi> there are <hi>two</hi> Ceremonies men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
of Swearing. <hi>One,</hi> of <hi>putting the hand
under the Thigh</hi> of him to whom the Oath was
made. Thus <hi>Eliezer</hi> swore to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 24.
and <hi>Joseph</hi> to <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 47. The <hi>other</hi> was <hi>by
lifting up the hand to heaven:</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth
the manner of an Oath, <hi>Gen. 14. 22. I
have lift up my hand to the most high God.</hi> And
thus God condescending to the manner of men,
expresseth himself, <hi>Deut. 32. 40. If I lift up my hand
to heaven, and swear.</hi> In allusion to this custome the
<hi>Psalmist</hi> describes the Perjured person, <hi>Psal. 144.
8. Whose mouth speaketh vanity; and whose right
hand is a right hand of falshood.</hi> And there is
not the least intimation in Scripture, that either
of these Ceremonies were prescribed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by God, but voluntarily instituted and
taken up by men. And thus among us the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony
of Swearing is <hi>by laying the hand on the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51556:14"/>
holy Gospel,</hi> and <hi>kissing the Book;</hi> which is both
very solemn and significant. And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why this solemn kind of Oath is called a <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall</hi>
Oath, and was anciently so called; because
the sign or ceremony of it is performed by some
part of the <hi>Body.</hi> And this Solemnity is an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation
of the Perjury, because it makes it
both more deliberate, and more scandalous.</p>
            <p>I shall speak but briefly to the</p>
            <p>IV. And last particular, <hi>viz.</hi> the sacred <hi>obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of an Oath: because it is a solemn appeal to
God as a witness of the truth of what we say:
To God, I say, from whose piercing and all-see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
eye, from whose perfect and infinite know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
nothing is or can be hid: So that there
is not a thought in our heart but he sees it, nor a
word in our tongue but he discerns the truth or
falshood of it. Whenever we swear, we appeal
to his knowledge, and refer our selves to his just
judgment, who is the powerfull Patron and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour
of Right, and the Almighty Judge and
Avenger of all falshood and unrighteousness.
So that it is not possible for men to lay a more
sacred and solemn obligation upon their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
than by the Religion of an Oath. <hi>Moses</hi>
very well expresseth it, by <hi>binding our souls with a
bond. Numb. 30. 2. If a man swear an oath, to bind
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51556:15"/>
his soul with a bond;</hi> intimating that he that
swears, lays the strongest obligation upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and puts his Soul in pawn for the truth
of what he says. And this obligation no man
can violate, but at the utmost peril of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and vengeance of God. For every Oath
implies a Curse upon our selves, in case of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,
as <hi>Plutarch</hi> observes. And this was always
the sense of Mankind, concerning the obligation
of Oaths. <hi>Nullum vinculum ad astringendam fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
majores nostri jurejurando arctius esse volue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi>
saith <hi>Tully; Our fore-fathers had no stricter
bond, whereby to oblige the faith of men to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
than that of an Oath.</hi> To the same purpose is
that in the <hi>Comedian, Aliud si scirem, qui firmare
meam apud vos possem fidem, sanctius quàm jusju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum,
id pollicerer tibi. If I knew any thing more
sacred than an Oath, whereby to confirm to you the
truth of what I say, I would make use of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will crave your patience a little longer,
whilest by way of inference from this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
I represent to you the great Sin of <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in common conversation,</hi> upon trivial and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
occasions; and the hainousness of the sin of
<hi>Perjury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>First.</hi> The great sin of <hi>Swearing,</hi> upon tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
and needless occasions, in common conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51556:15"/>
Because an Oath is a solemn thing, and
reserved for great occasions, to give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
to our word in some weighty matter,
and to put an end to controversies which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
otherwise be peremptorily and satisfactorily
decided. And therefore to use Oaths upon light
occasions, argues great profaneness and irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Almighty God. So <hi>Vlpian</hi> the great
Roman Lawyer observes, <hi>Nonnullos esse faciles ad
jurandum contemptu Religionis, that mens proneness
to swearing comes from a contempt of Religion;</hi> than
which nothing disposeth men more to Atheism
and Infidelity. Besides that it doth many times
surprize men unawares into Perjury: And how
can it be otherwise, when men use to interlard
all their careless talk with Oaths, but that they
must often be perjur'd? And which is worse, it
prepares men for deliberate perjury: For with
those who are accustomed to swear upon light
occasions, an Oath will go off with them more
roundly about weightier matters. <hi>From a common
custome of swearing</hi> (saith <hi>Hierocles) men easily slide
into perjury: Therefore</hi> (says he) <hi>if thou wouldest
not be perjured, do not use to swear.</hi> And this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
is the meaning of St. <hi>James,</hi> when he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
Christians so vehemently against common
swearing, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (for so some of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51556:16"/>
best ancient Copies read it) <hi>least ye fall into hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy,</hi>
that is, least ye lye and be perjured, by using
your selves to rash and inconsiderate swearing.</p>
            <p>And men expose themselves to this danger to
no purpose; Oaths in common discourse being
so far from confirming a man's word, that with
wise men they much weaken it: For common
swearing (if it have any serious meaning at all)
argues in a man a perpetual distrust of his own
reputation, and is an acknowledgment that he
thinks his bare word not to be worthy of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit.
And it is so far from adorning and filling
a man's discourse, that it makes it look swolne
and bloated, and more bold and blustring than
becomes persons of gentle and good breeding.
Besides, that it is a great incivility, because it
highly offends and grates upon all sober and
considerate persons; who cannot be presumed
with any manner of ease and patience to hear
God affronted, and his great and glorious Name
so irreverently tost upon every slight occasion.</p>
            <p>And it is no excuse to men that many times
they do it ignorantly, and not observing and
knowing what they do. For certainly it is no
extenuation of a fault, that a man hath got the
habit of it so perfect, that he commits it when
he do's not think of it: Which consideration
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51556:16"/>
should make men oppose the beginnings of this
Vice, lest it grow into a habit very hard to be left.
<hi>Nemo novit, nisi qui expertus est, quàm sit difficile
consuetudinem jurandi extinguere,</hi> saith St. <hi>Austin;
No man knows, but he that hath tryed, how hard it is
to get rid of this custome of Swearing:</hi> But yet it is
certain men may do it, by resolution, and great
care of themselves: For he that can chuse whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he will speak or not, can chuse whether he
will swear or not when he speaks. <hi>Major consue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudo
majorem intentionem flagitat; the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate
a custome is, the greater care should be used
to break our selves of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, This practice is so contrary to so plain
a Precept of our Saviour, and by the breach
whereof we incurr so great a danger (as St. <hi>James</hi>
assures us) that it must be a great charity that
can find out a way to reconcile a common
custome of swearing with a serious belief of the
Christian Religion: Which I would to God those
who are concerned would seriously lay to heart.
Especially, since this Sin of all others hath the
least of Temptation to it. Profit or Pleasure
there is none in it; nor any thing in mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
tempers to incite them to it. For though
some men pour out Oaths so freely as if they
came naturally from them, yet surely no man is
born of a swearing constitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:51556:17"/>
All that can be pretended for it, is Custome
and Fashion: But, to shew that this is no Excuse,
it is very observable, that it is particularly in the
matter of Oaths and Perjury that the Holy
Ghost gives that caution, <hi>Thou shalt not follow a
multitude to do evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lastly, it deserves to be considered, that
this sin is so much the greater because of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
returns of it, in those that are accustomed
to it. So that although it were but small in it
self (as it is not) yet the frequent practice of this
sin would quickly mount it up to a great score.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To represent the heinousness of
the sin of <hi>Perjury.</hi> But before I aggravate this
Crime, it is fit to let men know how many ways
they may be guilty of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> When a man asserts upon oath what he
knows to be otherwise: Or promiseth what he
does not intend to perform. In both these cases
the very act of swearing is Perjury. And so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
when a man promiseth upon oath to do that
which it is unlawfull for him to do; because
this oath is contrary to a former obligation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> When a man is uncertain whether what
he swears to be true. This likewise is Perjury, in
the act; though not of the same degree of guilt
with the former, because it is not so fully and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51556:17"/>
against his knowledge and conscience. For
men ought to be certain of the truth of what
they assert upon oath, and not to swear at ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And therefore no man ought positively to
swear to the truth of any thing but what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
hath seen or heard: This being the highest
assurance men are capable of in this world. In
like manner, he is guilty of perjury in the same
degree, who promiseth upon oath what he is not
morally and reasonably certain he shall be able
to perform.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> They are likewise guilty of Perjury, who
do not use great plainness and simplicity in
oaths; but answer <hi>aequivocally</hi> and doubtfully, or
with reservation of something in their minds,
thinking thereby to salve the truth of what they
say. And we all know who they are that make
use of these arts, and maintain them to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;
to the infinite scandall of the Christian
Religion, and prejudice of humane Society, by
doing what in them lyes to destroy all Faith
and mutual Confidence among men. For
what can be a greater affront to God, than to
use his Name to deceive men? And what can
more directly overthrow the great end and use
of oaths, which are <hi>for confirmation,</hi> and to <hi>put an
end to strife?</hi> Whereas by these arts the thing is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51556:18"/>
left in the same uncertainty it was before, and
there is no decision of it. For there is hardly any
form of words can be devised so plain, as not to
be lyable to Equivocation: To be sure, a man
when he swears, may always reserve something
in his mind which will quite alter the sense of
what ever he can say or promise upon oath. And
this may be laid down for a certain Rule, That
all departure from the simplicity of an oath, is a
degree of Perjury; and a man is never a whit the
less forsworn, because his perjury is a little finer
and more artificiall than ordinary. And though
men think by this device to save themselves
harmless from the guilt of so great a Sin, they do
really increase it, by adding to their iniquity the
impudent folly of mocking God and deceiving
themselves.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is pleaded, in the favour of
<hi>mental reservation,</hi> that the whole Proposition, as
made up of what is exprest in words and of that
which is reserved in the mind, is true; For instance,
if a man being ask'd upon Oath whether he be a
Priest, shall answer he is not, reserving in his mind
that he is not a Priest of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> or some such
thing, the whole Proposition is true, and then
they say a man may swear to that which is true,
without danger of perjury: This is of no force,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51556:18"/>
because, though the whole Proposition be true,
it is deceitfull, and contrary to that sincerity
which ought to be in an oath: And the end of
an oath is hereby likewise defeated, which is to
ascertain the truth of what we say: But if a man
reserve something in his mind which alters the
truth of what he says, the thing is still as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and uncertain as it was before. Besides, if
this be a good reason; a man may swear with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
in all cases, because the reason equally
extends to all cases; for if the truth of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
as made up of what is express'd in words
and reserv'd in the mind, will excuse a man from
Perjury, then no man can be perjur'd that
swears with reservation: But this the <hi>Casuists</hi> of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church do not allow, but only in
some particular cases, as <hi>before an incompetent
Judge,</hi> or the like; for they see well enough that
if this were allow'd in all cases, it would destroy
all faith among men. And therefore since the
reason extends alike to all cases, it is plain that
it is to be allow'd in none.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly.</hi> He is guilty of Perjury after the act,
who having a real intention when he swears, to
perform what he promiseth, yet afterwards neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
to do it: Not for want of Power (for so long
as that continues the obligation ceaseth) but
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51556:19"/>
for want of Will, and due regard to his oath.</p>
            <p>Now that Perjury is a most heinous Sin, is
evident, because it is contrary to so plain and
great a Law of God; one of the ten <hi>Words</hi> or
<hi>Precepts</hi> of the Moral Law, <hi>Thou shalt not take
the Name of the Lord thy God in vain;</hi> thou shalt
not bring or apply the name of God to a fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
Or, as <hi>Josephus</hi> renders it, <hi>Thou shalt not
adjure God to a false thing:</hi> Which our <hi>Saviour</hi>
renders yet more plainly, <hi>Matth. 5. 33. Thou shalt
not forswear thy self.</hi> For he seems to refer to the
<hi>third</hi> Commandment when he says, <hi>Ye have heard
that it was said to them of old time, thou shalt not
forswear thy self,</hi> as he had done before to the <hi>6th.</hi>
and <hi>7th.</hi> when he says, <hi>It was said to them of old
time, thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not commit adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi>
So that the primary, if not the sole intention
of this Law, <hi>Thou shalt not take the name of the
Lord thy God in vain,</hi> is to forbid the great sin of
Perjury. And I do not remember that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the phrase of <hi>taking God's name in vain,</hi> is
used in any other sense. And thus it is certainly
used, <hi>Prov. 30. 9. Lest I be poor and steal, and take
the name of the Lord my God in vain: i. e.</hi> lest Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
should tempt me to steal, and stealth should
engage me in Perjury. For among the <hi>Jewes</hi> an
oath was tendered to him that was suspected of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51556:19"/>
theft, as appears from <hi>Levit.</hi> 6. 2. where it is said,
<hi>If any one be guilty of theft, and lyeth concerning it,
or sweareth falsly; he shall restore all that about
which he hath sworn falsly. Left I steal, and take the
name of the Lord my God in vain;</hi> that is, be perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
being examined upon oath concerning a
thing stoln. And for this reason the thief and the
perjured person are put together, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. 4. where
it is said, that <hi>a curse shall enter into the house of the
thief, and of him that sweareth falsly by the name of
God.</hi> From all which it is very probable, that the
whole intention of the <hi>3d.</hi> Commandment is to
forbid this great sin of Perjury. To deterr men
from which, a severe threatning is there added;
<hi>for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his
name in vain;</hi> that is, he will most severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
such a one. And 'tis very obseravble, that
there is no threatning added to any other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
but to <hi>this</hi> and the <hi>second;</hi> Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to us that next to Idolatry and the worship
of a false God, Perjury is one of the greatest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
that can be offered to the divine Majesty.
This is one of those sins that cries so loud to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and quickens the pace of God's judgments,
<hi>Mal. 3. 9. I will come near to you in judgment, and be
a swift witness against the swearer.</hi> For this God
threatens utter destruction to the man and his
house, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5. 4. speaking of the <hi>curse that goeth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51556:20"/>
over the face of the whole earth; God</hi> (says he) <hi>will
bring it forth, and it shall enter into the house of him
that sweareth falsly by the name of God, and shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in the midst of his house, and shall consume it,
with the timber thereof and the stones thereof. It shall
remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume
it.</hi> This sin by the secret judgment of God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermines
Estates and Families, to the utter ruine
of them. And among the <hi>Heathen</hi> it was always
reckoned one of the greatest of Crimes, and
which they did believe God did not only punish
upon the guilty person himself, but upon his
family and posterity; and many times upon
whole Nations, as the <hi>Prophet</hi> also tells us, that
<hi>because of Oaths the Land mourns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not use many words to aggravate this
sin; it is certainly a Crime of the highest nature.
Deliberate Perjury being directly against a man's
knowledge, so that no man can commit it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
staring his Conscience in the face; which is
one of the greatest aggravations of any Crime.
And it is equally a sin against <hi>both Tables;</hi> being
the highest affront to God, and of most injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
consequence to men. It is an horrible abuse of
the name of God, an open contempt of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and an insolent defiance of his Vengeance:
And in respect of men, it is not only a wrong to
this or that particular person who suffers by it,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51556:20"/>
but Treason against humane Society; subverting
at once the foundations of publick Peace and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and the private security of every man's life
and fortune. It is a defeating of the best and last
way that the wisdome of men could devise for the
decision of doubtfull matters. <hi>Solomon</hi> very fully
and elegantly expresseth the destructive nature of
this sin, <hi>Prov. 25. 18. A false witness against his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow:</hi> Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that amongst all the instruments of ruine
and mischief that have been devised by mankind,
none is of more pernicious consequence to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Society than Perjury, and breach of Faith. It
is <hi>a pestilence that</hi> usually <hi>walketh in darkness,</hi> and a
secret stab and blow against which many times
there is no possibility of defence.</p>
            <p>And therefore it highly concerns those who upon
these and the like occasions are called upon their
Oath, whether as <hi>Jurors</hi> or <hi>Witnesses,</hi> to set God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes, and to have his fear in their hearts,
whenever they come to take an oath: And to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
and discharge their consciences in this matter
by known and approved Rules, and by the Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of pious and wise men; and not by the loose
Reasonings and Resolutions of <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> sent
abroad to serve the turns of unpeaceable and ill-minded
men (whether <hi>Atheists,</hi> or <hi>Papists,</hi> or others)
on purpose to debauch the Consciences of men by
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51556:21"/>
teaching them to play fast and loose with oaths. And
it is a very sad sign of the decay of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
amongst us, to see so many who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Christians, to make so little conscience of so
great a sin, as even the Light of Nature would
blush and tremble at.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will conclude all with those excellent</hi> Sayings <hi>of
the Son of</hi> Sirach <hi>concerning these two sins (I have
been speaking of) of Profane Swearing, and Perjury,</hi>
Eccle. 23. 9, 10, &amp;c. Accustome not thy mouth to swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
neither use thy self to the naming of the holy One. A
man that useth much swearing shall be filled with iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and the plague shall never depart from his house. If he
shall offend, his sin shall be upon him; and if he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
not his sin, he maketh a double offence. And if he
swear falsly, he shall not be innocent, but his house shall be
full of calamities. <hi>And to represent to us the dreadful
nature of this sin of Perjury,</hi> There is <hi>(saith he)</hi> a word
that is clothed about with death, <hi>meaning a rash and
false Oath;</hi> There is a word that is clothed about with
death, God grant it be not found in the heritage of Jacob:
For all such things shall be far from the godly; and they
will not wallow in these sins. <hi>From which God preserve
all good men, and make them careful to preserve
themselves; as they value the present peace of their
own consciences, and the favour of Almighty God
in this World and the other, for his Mercies sake in</hi>
Jesus Christ. To whom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
