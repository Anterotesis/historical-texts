            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord, Sith I am borne your ſubiect, and that nature and reaſon doe binde me to ſerue and obey you: alſo that next vnto the ſeruice of God, I am to frame and direct whatſoeuer my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and thoughts to the preſeruation of your eſtate, the greatneſſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie thereof, and the peace and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of all that are likewiſe borne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your obedience: I can not in this late entrie into the warre which your highneſſe do begin, but bring for my part ſuch ſeruice and abilitie as I may, as well to auoide idleneſſe whileſt other are buſied, as to ſhew ſome proofe of my fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and to beare witneſſe of thoſe benefites and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which all your ſubiects, as alſo my ſelfe, haue hitherto re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued and made triall of vnder your gouernement. Some one will bring in his weapons and valiancie: ſome other wil contribute his coine and commodities: ſome other his arte and induſtrie: and all generally, whatſoeuer may aduaunce and ſet forward your enterpriſe. But I, contrarie to the reſt, doe come with a moſt humble admonition, conteining the moſt apparant reaſons which on a ſudden I could imagine, to withſtande and contrarie them, ſo farre as in me lieth, and peraduenture as a new Caſſandra, in fewe wordes to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, the importance and weight of that matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you nowe ſhippe your ſelfe: as being ſteadfaſtly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that by diſwading you, I ſhall doe more then all your captaines and armie, whether for your highneſſe particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, either for the benefite and quiet of your poore ſubiects, who ſtand amazed at the motion, miſtruſt the continuance, but eſpecially doe doubt and feare ſome great miſhappe and calamitie in the ende: and indeed I might well thinke my ſelfe periured and a traitour to that ſeruice which I owe to your highneſſe, in caſe I ſhoulde not alſo contribute, and purpoſing to doe well, I ſhould not, at the leaſt, ſtay the

miſchiefe and annoiance, to my power. Your highneſſe, whether of your owne motion to extende your limittes, and by the right of good ſcituation and commoditie to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate vnto your ſelfe ſundrie countries, holdes and townes, ſo to purchaſe reputation, and after the example of your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours to atchieue notable and immortall memorie: either elſe by the perſwaſion and inducement of others, haue ſeiſed and gotten poſſeſsion of Rauell, Carmagnolle, and generally the whole Marquiſate of Saluces: alſo of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſon and ſome other fortreſſes in Daulphine: and now with the like full winde, doe thither leade a great and mightie ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, in hope to multiplie your conqueſts and annexe this prouince of Daulphine (which for the greatneſſe and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance thereof haue long ſince beene dedicated to the eldeſt ſonne of the houſe of France) to your territories of Piedmont and Sauoy. You finde all things requiſite for the intertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this armie, as you woulde wiſh: the hearts of your ſouldiers &amp; men of warre well diſpoſed: your treaſurie and ſtorehouſes well furniſhed: France ſo diuided, turmoiled and fleſhed in and againſt it ſelfe, that in your owne iudgement, you haue no cauſe to feare, and, which is more, ſundrie of the greateſt and moſt mightie with weapon in hand doe call and fauor you: aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alſo of all helpe &amp; ſuccor from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like maieſtie &amp; our holy father, whoſe authoritie, power, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons &amp; means, are terrible to the whole worlde: with great apparance and coniectures you foreſee a diſsipation and partition of the ſtate and crowne of France, and that euerie man will carrie away his morſell: and you preſuppoſe that you haue as good right as the reſt, as beeing ſonne and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band to Princeſſes of the blood of Fraunce and houſe of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lois: finally mooued and led by a holy and religious intent, you purpoſe to preuent the ruine and ſubuerſion of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, Catholike &amp; Apoſtolike Religion in this prouince, which is halfe baniſhed and cannot long ſubſiſt without ſpeedie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie. Thus doe you find your purpoſe to bee both honeſt and eaſie: The ſucceſſe hitherto doeth alſo put you in great hope of as happie an ende: and that at the leaſt by the lawe of ſhipwracke and waſte, ſo much as maie lie nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt your coaſt muſt belong to you. Theſe indeede are great and mightie motions, ſufficient to encourage the
<pb facs="tcp:21635:3"/>
moſt fearefull, to ſtirre vp the leaſt ambicious and to moue euen the ſloweſt and moſt duetifull: ſithe ſuch facilitie is found to concurre with honour and commoditie: as alſo it is the cauſe of worldly matters and the naturall order of generation that ſpringeth of corruption: and in ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes eſpecially the taking holde of fitte occaſion is it that woorketh the faireſt and moſt permanent effectes. Yea, I will graunt that the Gangrene hauing ſeiſed vpon the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of this great bodie (as it hath) the members and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde partes maie well bee cut off for the preſeruation of the reſt: But yet, if your Highneſſe will conſider and weigh ſuch reaſons, difficulties, and empeachments as are therein, I am aſſured you ſhall finde them to bee of farre greater importaunce then all that haue yet beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is but too certaine that all changes from a long peace into a ſudden and great warre are moſt dangerous, the rather becauſe the peaceable perſon is leſſe trained to warre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſſe accuſtomed to ſuffer and beare, and leſſe fit to endure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie tedious enterpriſe: and this if it be true in ſtates that are in ſtrength and power equall, which through a certaine mutuall feare doe mainteine and vpholde themſelues, much rather then among vnequall Lordſhippes, of whome the leſſer moſt looke to keepe and maintaine themſelues, rather then to enterpriſe againſt or aſſaile the greater. This is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie lawe of nature imprinted euen in all creatures, among whom the ſmall doe yeeld to the great, and are to account it a fauour and courteſie that they bee not bruiſed and euen ſwalowed vp. Nowe therefore what proportion is there betweene your highneſſe power and the power of Fraunce: which is twentie or thirtie times greater then all that you poſſeſſe: peopled and abounding accordingly: trayned and exerciſed in warres theſe thirtie yeares continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie? Haue not wee (without ſeeking anie further) an example, euen of late, of the loſſe of all the landes that you poſſeſſe, as well on this ſide, as beyonde the Alpes: alſo of the extremitie whereto your late father of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie memorie was for a long time brought, onely in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing too mightie an enemie of the Frenchman? Doe not the ſounde of the warres of Piemont, which the paſſage
<pb facs="tcp:21635:4"/>
of the power and troopes through this countrie ſtill ring in our eares? Is there any thing more eaſie or commodious for the French man, then to bound and limit the confines of his realme euen with the Alpes: &amp; as it were by the way to tame end ſubdue vs? If therefore the example of your parents ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine &amp; ouerthrow ſhould reſtraine you, much more the quiet enioying of his eſtate after hee hath recouered it, wherein himſelfe inuiolably remained, ought to inſtruct and diuert you from ſo raſh an enterpriſe. He had purchaſed (and that iuſtly) the fame to be one of the wiſeſt and moſt ſtaied prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Europe, but eſpecially for that among ſo manie his neighbours troubles &amp; warres, he had abſtained from warre and kept his countries in peace: and yet had great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in warlike affaires: wanted no intelligences, or parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers in France, and ſaw it in as great diuiſions and flame of warres, as nowe it is in: and as for wealth hee hath left you ſo much as maie ſuffice to furniſh the entertainment of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie great armie: as wiſelie foreſeeing the incertaine ende of warres, which for the moſt part are ſweete at the beginning, but difficult in the proſecution, and moſt bitter and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the ende. Yea, and the ſame aduice and counſaile did he giue the French king nowe raigning, when at his returne out of Polelande hee paſſed through his Countrie: and for want of following it, his affaires haue had ſo badde ſucceſſe. This is and ought to bee vnto you a patterne and rule of conduct for your eſtate, which by this meanes hee hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured and left vnto you, flouriſhing and full of all wealth and commoditie: his inſtructions and domeſtical precepts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of ſo great and tried a iudgement, ought with you to preuaile aboue all other either gracious or flattering counſailes. Yea, hee neuer attempted any thing againſt the Switzers, who in power are nothing equall with Fraunce, but contrariwiſe, chooſe rather to leaue and abandon vnto them part of the lands that they had vſurped vpon him, then to attempt the euents of warre againſt that ſo warlike a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Haue not our ſelues, and that of late yeeres, ſeene what happened to the king and kingdome of Portugall, which had ſo long flouriſhed in a happie peace, and euen in a moment is periſhed and extinct through raſh enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing to aſſaile a mightier then him ſelfe vpon a vaine
<pb facs="tcp:21635:4"/>
ſhew and hope, which neuertheleſſe ſeemed to be very well grounded, yea euen vpon pietie and religion.</p>

               </gap>ull of like examples, neither neede I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further to delate the reaſons: for in the end, if the leſſer will warre vpon the greater, he muſt doe it onely by practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and drifts, by corruption and rewardes, and by a politike diſcretion which the wiſeſt did alwaies practiſe: that is, ſtill to nouriſh the warres and diuiſions, if there be any: and ſtill to feede the fire, not to quench it, that they may haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leaſure nor power to thinke vpon any other then them ſelues and for them ſelues. The Catholike Maieſtie hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all thinges very well obſerued and practiſed this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, yea and that ſo happely, that France, which hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vpon leſſe occaſion and pretence would haue inuaded and ſet foote in his lands, hath now refuſed them when they were offered: as finding it ſelfe brought to that paſſe, that it was time to imploy all endeuours to quench the fire of ciuil warres which were kindled euerie where. True it is that England, which is as mightie in reſpect of Spaine, as you in reſpect of France, hath in part returned it to him, and for theſe twentie yeares &amp; more, haue very cunningly entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and nouriſhed the warres in the low countries, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hath warranted it ſelfe from a threatned inuaſion and ruine. What els then doe you in departing from theſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticall and freſh examples, other then the contrarie? You weake, doe aſſaile one ſtrong: you in peace and aſſured in your State, do hazard it to the perill of an vncertaine warre: you that hold your eſtate of France, ſtand greatly bound vnto her, and of late of meere courteſie haue receiued Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiglian and Pignerothes, through ſo great an offence as is the aſſailing and ſeiſing vpon her townes and territories, doe incurre ſo notable a blemiſh of ingratitude, which can not be cloaked vnder whatſoeuer pretence: If iniuries and offences be aggrauated and accounted of according to the vnworthineſſe of the offender, together with the qualitie and quantitie of the offence. If wrong done to an afflicted perſon, be accounted greater then that which is done to one in proſperitie: If the miſdemeanors of parents towards pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, of friendes towards friends, of ſeruants towards their maiſters, of children towards their parents, and of ſubiectes
<pb facs="tcp:21635:5"/>
towarde their Lords, haue euermore beene accounted exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable, &amp; they puniſhed as paricides. With what reaſon or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour may your enterpriſe be manteined, ſith you can not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any neceſsitie, or offence before giuen? But contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that you leauy warre againſt him that had gotten all your countrie, and hath giuen it you againe: that hath bound you by oth, and hath kept it with you: whoſe vaſſall through ſome of your Lordſhips you are, and vnto whom, as vnto the mightieſt, without compariſon, you owe all due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and feare. There is (ſaid a certaine auncient) no warre iuſt, but that which is neceſſarie: but you ſeeke this of a io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and that not without ſome ſpot of impietie and ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, whether againſt God, who is the God of hoſtes, ſith againſt your own conſcience and religion, you aſſault a moſt Catholike king: whether againſt your honor and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie: either els againſt the peace and calamitie of your poore ſubiects, who can not expect any other then the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ruin and loſſe of all their goodes: for (to bee briefe) doe you thinke, that a king of France will put vp ſuch an iniurie, at a Duke of Sauoyes hand? Either if he would, that ſo many princes of his bloud, ſo many great Lords and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his crowne: ſo many braue and couragious Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines: ſo warlike nobilitie: ſo many townes and ſo much people, in whoſe harts and affections the <hi>Floure de Luce</hi> hath taken roote ſo many worlds agoe, wil brooke ſuch an inuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and will not ſpeedely be reuenged, and with a miſerable ſpoile, force and confine you into your Piedmont, and ſo we in theſe partes remaine a pray to the conquerors? What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit ſhall you then reape of all your conqueſts, except accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the prouerbe, in fiſhing for ſome ſmall fiſh, to loſe a golden hooke of farre greater value. What may you els haue done but quenched that fire which you ſhould haue kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, vnited thoſe whom you ſhoulde haue ſet at debate, ſtrengthened the members of a moſt mightie bodie, in the weakening whereof it had beene your profit to haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied all your induſtrie: In ſumme, ceaſed their warres and diuiſions, the continuation whereof is your good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation. It is too common a prouerbe, yet to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: That dogges do often fight together, yet ſo ſoone as they ſpye the woolfe, they leaue their brawles, and together
<pb facs="tcp:21635:5"/>
runne againſt the common enimie: ſo likewiſe brethren and kinſmen otherwiſe at ſtrife and deuided, vpon the tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the honour of their familie and houſe, laying aſide all rancor and enimitie, or at the leaſt, deferring it, doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende them ſelues, in and againſt all: and naturall affection ſurmounteth that which is but accidentall: the generall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt reclaimeth and forceth them to forget the particular. Againſt you, the conſideration of your ſmalneſſe, and the greatneſſe of the iniurie, being done in ſo wofull a time, which alwaies will be imputed to a bragge, inſolencie, and raſhneſſe, will the more prouoke all France, and breede in them a ſpeedie vnion and league: and the wiſeſt will be very glad of ſuch an occaſion to ende their diuiſions and partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as, ſurely there is no better way or certainer remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ciuill warres, then to ſet vppon the enemies ſubiects. We read that the Romanes being on a time at iarre, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie came into the towne and tooke the Capitoll, but they ſuddenly agreed to driue him away: The like did they againſt the Veients, and the princes &amp; people of Thuſcane, who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their ciuill warres had aſſailed them, and in lieu of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting anie thing from them, remained vanquiſhed &amp; brought into ſubiection. The like did the Spaniſh nations when they ſo farre reuolted againſt the Emperour Charles the fift, as to force the D. of Calaber to take the crowne: for beeing in armes one againſt another, king Frances the firſt ſent an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and recouered the realme of Nauarre and Fontarabie: but the Spaniſh troubles being ſuddenly appeaſed, with one common conſent thy fell vpon the French, and driue them out of all the land that they had conquered, and neuer after thought vpon their factions and reuolts: and we ſee ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie that in townes and communalties the enuies, enmities and ielouſies of particular perſons are trode vnder foote ſo ſoone as the enemie doeth appeare, and all, euen they which before would haue ſlaine each other, doe with one mind run to defend the breach.</p>
            <p>Let vs not then deceiue our ſelues in too much flattering and reioycing in our forces and commodities, neither let vs perſwade our ſelues that the Frenchmens diuiſions are ſo rooted and grauen in them, that they cannot be ſoone taken away and appeaſed. The long co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of their miſchiefes,
<pb facs="tcp:21635:6"/>
the extremities of the peoples miſeries, the experience of that which is paſt, the ſmall effect of their ciuill warres theſe 25, or 30. yeres, and eſpecially theſe laſt troubles, longer and more pernitious the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt, which doe as it were vndermine the verie foundations of this Monarchie and eſtate, together with the obiect of an enemie, will prouoke them to vnitie &amp; agreement. It is well knowen that in the eſtates now aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, moſt of the prouinces do require peace, that there be a great number of Catholike Lords that doe bewaile the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the eſtate, and with great impaciencie doe beare theſe ambitious commotions and proud innouations.</p>
            <p>Would you thinke that men do iudge it to be the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Maieſtie, vnder whoſe aduow, and with whoſe helpe you enterpriſe this warre, and that without ſuch aſſurance you would not meddle. The Spaniard then, the hereditarie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of France, is he that aſſaileth it: hee it is that ſeeketh to ſwallow vp the whole world vnder his Empire, &amp; to become the ſole and only Monarch thereof: he it is whoſe mortal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is naturally grauen in euery true French hart, whoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is accounted cruell and intollerable, againſt whome the inhabitants of the low countries are reuolted, chooſing rather to venture vpon ſo manie extremities, then againe to fall vnder his dominion: and now to this Spaniſh Cornet ſhal not the French eares bee open, their haires ſtand vpright, their hands be armed, neither the hearts of ſo manie princes, Lords, gentlemen, and others, both warlike and couragious, be puffed vp with a deſire of reuenge, and the iuſt defence of their fellow citizens? or will they incurre ſo great a blemiſh of infamie and cowardlineſſe, as to ſuffer themſelues to bee wronged and prouoked by ſo weake and impatient an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie as you? To be briefe and without diſsimulation, would the Catholike Maieſtie forſake and abandon the recouerie of his countries to the end to denou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce a new war vnto France? Hee who with all his power and ſtrength hath not beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in twentie yeares to reduce two ſmall prouinces, Holland and Zealand into his obedience, and of late hath incurred ſo great and notable a loſſe of noble Spaniſh Lords, captaines, and veſſels, yea euen of his reputation in that great ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and diſsipation of his nauie, in the preparation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had employed all his power for the conqueſt of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb facs="tcp:21635:6"/>
will nowe enterpriſe againſt France which hath ſo oft withſtood him, and whoſe armies to his loſſe hee hath ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten felt and tried? Againe, who is ignorant of the great prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes and intelligences of the king of Portugall, whoſe eſtate hath forciblie and by violence beene deteined by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, who hath farre more intereſt in the preſeruation of his conqueſts, and greater cauſe to preuent the loſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolts thereof, then to dreame elſe where? This conſideration therefore muſt not amaze them, but they may be aſſured that hee will ſtill employ his forces and meanes vppon his firſt purpoſes, which are more neceſſarie and honourable for him, beſides that, it is well knowen that ordinarilie hee is crazed, and as it were in a manner at his ende: which if it ſhould happen, his eſtates coulde not eſchew great diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſedition and reuoltes, the ſparkes whereof doe alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die appeare in Spaine and elſe where, and then will it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture bee too late for you to repent your ouer raſh counſels.</p>
            <p>But admit you were aſſured of his ſuccour and helpe, yet doe you not both ſee and heare the claſhing of your neighbours the Switzers armes, who feare nothing ſo much as your proſperitie, and alone are ſufficient to withſtande you: who alreadie beginne to ſtirre: who doe inuite and counſaile the French to whom they are bound and confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, to withſtand your purpoſes, and to force you to reſtore and yeeld vp that which you haue vſurped: you haue of late yeeres prouoked them, and yet through their diſcretion and vſuall forbearance, they haue bene deſirous by treaties and capitulations to bring you to peace, and to withdraw your forces, rather then to enter into a daungerous warre: they know your meanes and pretences, alſo that to this day they detaine the Bailiwikes from you: and that your proſperitie or power is their ruine and hinderance: and therefore you maie be ſure, that for their honour and reputation, whereof they are wonderfull iealous, together with their duetie to France, they wil withſtand your purpoſes, &amp; being wel vnited together, will part among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this miſerable countrie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your ſelf haue no wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of ſuch ſubiects, both great &amp; ſmal, as bearing you but holow harts, would gladly ſhake of the yoke of your obedience, ſo to obteine liberty, &amp; to free themſelues
<pb facs="tcp:21635:7"/>
from ſuch taxes and impoſitions you as haue laid vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them. True it is that the Switzers are at iarre among them ſelues, alſo that you may haue many partakers, but the proteſtant Cantons are ſtill the ſtrongeſt, and will ſpeedely lend all aide and ſuccours to the Huguenotes of Daulphine their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, with whom they haue of long time had ordinarie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, we ſhall ſee whether the tongues and pennes of the wiſer ſorte at Geneua, whoſe intereſt herein is greateſt, will be quiet: yea and in France, where there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance of braue and good wits, whether they will not both in wordes and writing ſtirre vp euery true French hart againſt you and your ingratitudes, which they will exage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſo that if heretofore thouſands of Lordes and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men tooke vpon them the croſſe for the conquering of ſuch farre countries from the Sarazens, will they now ſuffer you to inuade their owne realme? Either will not this houſe of Bourbon, which after the kings diſceaſe that now raigneth, is called to the crowne: which alſo euermore haue brought forth ſuch warlike and valiant princes, take hart and aduice how to maintaine and preſerue that which iuſtly is their due? To be briefe, ſhall this noble bloud of France be as it were blemiſhed and tainted with ſuch cowardlineſſe and want of courage, as to ſuffer that Prouince of France which hath the particular prerogatiue and priuiledge ſtill to bee dedicated to the eldeſt ſonne of the crowne and neareſt heire thereof, be loſt and vſurped by a ſtraunger? will they not in ſuch a caſe be touched with ielouſie, and particularly with iuſt ſorrow, which may prouoke and moue them to preſerue their owne, ſith at this day the crowne returneth to them: I ſpeake generally, leauing all queſtions of law, and election of perſons, and cleaue onely to the Salicque fonda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall law, inuiolably obſerued by the French, who aboue all nations haue euermore beene highly commended and renowned for their moſt faithfull obedience &amp; loue to their kinges and the princes of their bloud.</p>
            <p>Together with the Switzers, the State of Venice, and the Duke of Mantua, who aboue all other doe feare the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe of the Spaniard and you, and are moſt deſirous of the reeſtabliſhment and preſeruation of the State of France,
<pb facs="tcp:21635:7"/>
will not faile to admoniſh the French king of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and importance of your enterpriſes, and, if need be, to contribute and enter confederacie for the hindering and breaking of them off.</p>
            <p>Thus of all your pretences and apparent inductions there remaineth no more but your intelligences and partakers, which you may haue in France, togither with the Catholike Apoſtolike, and Romiſh Religion, to the vpholding whereof, you take all faithfull Princes and Chriſtians to be called and bound: How then? Who is more inclined, more bent, or more earneſtly giuen thereto, then the French king nowe reigning, who vnder the reigne of his brother Charles, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied all his youth therein, and hath tried all wayes &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſecretly and openly, and all clemencie, for the rooting out of the contrarie religion, and euen now for the ſame end holdeth his eſtates? who alſo is ſo deſirous to compaſſe it, that hee hath forgotten all particular friendſhip and hatred, and is purpoſed and reſolued vpon no other thing, to the end afterward moſt happilie to end his dayes. This notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, hee is ſtill king, hee is endued with great gifts of the minde, and zealous of his honour: and as all other men, hee is capable of iuſt ſorow when hee is prouoked and offended: will he then ſuffer his memorie to bee taxed in all poſteritie and ſpotted with ſuch ignominie, as to ſuffer the Duke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy to bereaue him of the Marquiſate of Saluces, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to rauiſh and take from him all tokens, reliques and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of the kings his predeceſſours conqueſts in the realme of Naples and prouince of Italie? To ſeiſe vpon Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magnolles the Arſenoll of France? Now euen during his life to take an othe of fidelitie of his ſubiects, and to cauſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be acknowledged as Lorde, diſpatching all things in his owne name? And afterwarde by force of armes to enter his Realme, and to put garriſon into his townes.</p>
            <p>In thoſe extremities which vndoubtedly doe oppreſſe him, he will haſten againſt him that diſmembreth, his eſtate, and as alreadie he hath ſundrie times experimented, he will grant peace to his ſubiects, rather then in his dayes ſee his garments rent in ſunder. So in the time of king Charles, in the yeare 1562. the troubles ceaſed almoſt as ſoone as the Engliſh ſet foote in France, and had gotten New hauen: and
<pb facs="tcp:21635:8"/>
his ſubiects agreed together to fall vpon the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. True it is, that his princes, nobilitie, townes &amp; commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties are now at greater diuiſion, and more fleſhed each a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt other then they were then: that now there is more in their power and poſſeſsion which helpe you, and togither with you do purpoſe the ſharing of this realme. That theſe Lords your partakers are as it were maſters of the ſtate, and haue the ſtrength and Metropolitane towne of the realme in their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds: That it is vnpoſsible to reunite the harts that are thus alienated, and to regenerate and reduce into the hearts of the princes of the blood &amp; mightie Catholike Lords, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, gentlemen and ſubiects of the contrarie part, which are many, a confidence and loue of their king, and therefore the fire which ſtill ſhall, be kindled in the heart of the realme, wil greatly let them from being able to ſuccour the outwarde bounds. But what? The king, who by force &amp; at the induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Lords, once made an edict of reunion with them, whereby they be bound to abandon all leagues and aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions either within or without the realme, being (as he is) dulie aduertiſed of your intelligences with them, of the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they graunt you of Prouince and D'aulphine, ſo as you alſo bind your ſelfe to expell thoſe of the contrarie reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and afterwarde to helpe them with your power and meanes, to make them likewiſe maſters of their parts &amp; por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The king, I ſay, who beſides infinite others hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued two iniuries and diſpleaſures: this, the moſt ſhameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt that euer Prince receyued: namely, to bee expelled out of his ſeate, the Parliament and principall towne of his realme, and afterwarde to be ſo farre iniuried as to be driuen to thruſt from about him his moſt auncient and moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruaunts and officers of the Crowne, to the ende him ſelfe to bee ſerued and poſſeſſed by them, not that hee choſe but that were preſcribed and preſented vnto him: ſhall hee not both iuſtlie and honeſtlie goe from anie othe or woorde that hee maie haue promiſed vnto them without breach of fayth and promiſe? Shall not the Princes of the blood, the officers of the Crowne, the Parliaments, Nobilitie and Townes, the moſte whereof doe ſee and knowe the euident inconueniences and domages of the continuation of the warres, admoniſh him to ſtay no longer
<pb facs="tcp:21635:8"/>
in this ſo ſtraunge bondage, but to ridde and free himſelfe from this tyrannie of theſe maiſters of the Palace: to whoſe paſsions and ambitions hee is vtterly ſubiect. To be briefe, ſhall not the States, which repreſent the ſoundeſt part of the Realme, and are aſſembled togither to preuent the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities and ruines which threaten it, ſeeing ſo great a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe to happen during their aſſemblie, conclude vppon a mutuall confederacie agaynſt the authours thereof and all forreine enemies? Either ſhall not the king togither with them call to minde their originall aduauncement, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion, togither with the bondes wherein they are bound to Fraunce, which in the meane time they nowe rent in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſmember? Theſe children be they not worſe then their fathers, who with the like tyrannous ambition poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and brideled king Frances the ſecond, &amp; vnder his name and authoritie, did enterpriſe to put to death the chiefe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the blood of France, and fathers to the princes now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, albeit neither acknowledged, neither mainteined in their degrees and dignities vnto them due? Be not theſe they who through their ſleights, haue alwayes mainteyned the warres of France, &amp; had intelligence with the king of Spain, the ſworne enemie of France, and of late receyued his coine, ſought to deliuer Marſeilles &amp; diuers places into his hands: ſolicited the Prince of Parma with his Spaniſh power to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Fraunce, and to make warre vppon their king, that hath ſo rayſed and exalted them, that nowe they goe about to abaſe himſelfe, whome they haue forced contrarie to all lawe both of God and man, and contrarie to all order in Fraunce, to name a ſucceſſour: at this day doe forciblie detaine diuerſe great Townes and Caſtels, yea euen the principall Citie of the Realme, and vſe all thoſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whereof your diſcouerie ſhall furniſh a verie large campe? Shall not the king and princes awake out of their ſlumber and ſleepe, to the ende to ſee and iudge what is prepared for them? I can not denie but there bee pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides in Realmes and Empires: alſo that the wofull and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie deſtinie doe ſeeme to thruſt and hale Fraunce to her ende: Neuertheleſſe, were they no more but the king of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarres faction that withſtoode you in Daulphine or elſe where, I ſay and aduowe that they are more then enowe
<pb facs="tcp:21635:9"/>
to thruſt you backe into Piedmont, and to make you returne with ſhame and loſſe. Theſe thirtie yeares well neare haue the French kings employed all their power and ſtrength, which were without compariſon greater then at this day, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnited, againſt them: yet ſee we them ſtill ſhoote vp againe and encreaſe more then euer, namely ſince the laſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in France, they haue taken more towns, woonne more battels, fortified more holdes, and more ſtrengthened their partie then before: you are therefore to conſider particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt which part of them you bende your ſelfe: viz. to thoſe that are ſtrong in townes, &amp; multitude of warlike gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, if there be anie throughout the world, yea, and furniſhed with captaines of more experience: that is, thoſe that tooke Montlimart, Ambrune, Die, Cap, and ſundrie other: that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated the armie of the Lord of Vins, and another at Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limar, that inhabite a countrie by nature ſtrong, of acceſſe difficult, for ambuſhes and ſtratagemes, wherin they are moſt excellent, verie conuenient: and that at need ſhall be ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by their neighbors of Languedoc. Repoſe not therefore ſo much truſt in the promiſes and power of your partakers, who with a good wil, wil helpe themſelues with your means, men, and money, to eſtabliſh their power and authoritie, whoſe behauiours doe alreadie make them odious and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked of the moſt part of France, which ſigheth and groneth vnder the calamities that are ſprung out of their ambition. The king now reigning is no elder then they, whoſe ſpeedie ende wee are neither to feare, neither to hope for: if it ſhould happen alſo, that all good French Catholikes ſhould feare to fal into the obedience of a prince of contrarie religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet the continuance of the calamities and miſchiefs that vndermine them: the long proofe and tedious experience of the inabilitie of force and violence to force the minds to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue other then they would: the examples of the Germains and Switzers, which notwithſtanding the pluralitie of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe liue peaceably inough: and the aſſurance that they haue of the clemencie and mildneſſe of the king of Nauarre, who is he that chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to be preſumptiue heire and eldeſt of the crowne, will ſtill draw them to acknowledge him, and to yeeld vnto him the duties of faithfull and obedient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, rather then to ſtoupe to the dominion of theſe new and
<pb facs="tcp:21635:9"/>
forraine princes. They know the king of Nauarre to be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and mercifull, naturally not to be ambitious or a tyrant: they are not ignorant how often he hath deſired and reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to be inſtructed by a free counſell: that hee is a prince of his faith and word, and that by force and conſtraint hee was driuen and compelled to take weapon, which he now hath in hande, whoſe equitie hath appeared in the happie ſucceſſe that God hath giuen him againſt the armies of the Duke of Maine, the Marſhall of Biron, and the Duke of Ioieuſe, who thought to haue deuoured and ſwallowed him vp, yet hath he ſtill had the victorie. If then with theſe vertues and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections farre different from the cruelties and tragicall paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his enemies, he get the crowne, what are you to hope or feare of ſo warlike a Prince? So ſore bent againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Maieſtie, which detaineth his kingdome, and ſo well beloued among your neighbors the Switzers? Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore earneſtly that the ſhorteſt follies are the beſt: that then your partakers ſhall be but ſmall warrant vnto you, ſith they no whit ſubſiſt of their owne forces, but of other mens one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that with ſo extreeme violence as it cannot continue: for in the ende what foundation haue they of their power, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then of a broken reede: of the mutable minds of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant people, which forſake him whom before they fauoured ſo ſoone as they ſee his good hap abandon him, yea, and that doe not onely forſake him, but for the moſt part driue away, puniſh, or moſt ſhamefully murther him. Such there haue bin both in Athens and Rome, and being this day exalted to the heauens, haue bene to morow baniſhed and caſt down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. And alredie it is verie likely that the Pariſians wil ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhake off that yoke which a while they thought ſo ſweete, becauſe they ſee themſelues depriued of the preſence of their king, which bred their great commoditie and profite, vpon the ceaſing whereof will alſo ceaſe their amitie and good will that they bare to the procurers of the ceaſsing of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and traficke. The ſame people (and iuſtly) doe feare the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of their king whom they haue offended, and who is iuſtly wroth againſt them: as alſo they may iudge that hee diſſembleth his wrath for a ſeaſon, and that for this preſent he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with this puniſhment, viz. That he will not come at Paris. Euen this onely reaſon alreadie breedeth a repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb facs="tcp:21635:10"/>
in the Pariſians hearts, and a hatred of the authours, who haue offended and prouoked againſt themſelues a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the principall, the richeſt, &amp; the beſt alied inhabitants. How will it be when the king ſhall ſo manifeſtly reueale his hatred, that hee ſhall take from them part of the extent of their Parliament (as is alreadie forecaſt) of the chamber of accounts of aides and other iuriſdictions which are the cauſe that Paris is maintained in ſuch reſort &amp; greatneſſe? How wil it be when openly he ſhall bend himſelfe againſt them, and take from them (as he may) ſo manie priueledges which by the kings his predeceſſors haue beene graunted them, and by himſelfe confirmed? How will it be, when they ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture ſee themſelues brought into like eſtate, as at this day are Gaunt, Lisbourne, Diieon, and manie other townes heretofore moſt flouriſhing? Shall they not then remember that it is becauſe of their rebellions? Shall they not call to minde that the authours of the miſeries of France, are alſo the authours of the miſeries of Paris, and of all the countrie round about which is vtterly vndone, ruinated and waſted alreadie? Alreadie they taſte and know that the ciuill warres haue debarred them of halfe their traficke, haunt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of people, and moſt of them doe curſe the authours. Other townes by them detained, which alſo doe proue the like miſeries, yea, and farre greater, which are ſubdued by Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadels and great garriſons, will after the example of Paris, ſeeke after alteration of gouernours &amp; their former libertie.</p>
            <p>If at this day the king ſhew them anie fauour, yet is it a queſtion whether it be but in appearance, or in truth, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering what offences and iniuries they haue wrought him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that, albeit for a while he diſſemble, yet he will find a time when to puniſh them, euen ſo ſoone as he ſhall ſee time and oportunitie: and then ſhall you be deſtitute of all ſuch ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as you hoped of, for the defence of your wrongfull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe: But admit they obtaine that fauour in deede and without diſsimulation, yet can you bee aſſured that it will continue? Men are in all things variable, and eſpeciallie in amities, and among men, the greateſt are ſo when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that his greatneſſe whom they fauour may be hurtfull and preiudiciall to their owne eſtate: for there is nothing ſo ſubiect to iealouſie as dominion: For that doe men forſake

all diuinitie and humanitie: and gouernement can brooke no companion.</p>
            <p>Againe, the manifeſt diuiſion among them ought to ſtay, yea vtterlie to breake off your enterpriſe, ſith it is but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer likely that their particular quarels will ſufficientlie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre them from helping of others: further that within theſe three yeares they haue vſed and layde all their endeuours, and haue ſought, yet could not attaine to inuade the Duke of Bouillons ſouereigne territories, whereof they bee at this day in extreeme anguiſh. Their behauiour doe ſufficientlie ſhew it. Hardly could they finde one generall to vndertake the conduct of their armie into Poytou: They are extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie indebted, vrged and tormented by their creditors: They owe more then they are woorth, and that is the cauſe that they hazard, not their owne, but France: They haue procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the king of Nauarre to be moued to accorde, which if they could obteine, they would thinke themſelues reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie ſafe: and when their enterpriſes ſhall bee (as it is verie likelie) brought to nought, themſelues ſhall withall fall euen groueling to the ground. Here you ſee the pillars and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes of your enterpriſe. Contrariwiſe, the king of Nauarre is grounded vpon a match made long ſince of great patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall goods: of the lawe of France, which calleth him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all others to the crowne, and eſpecially of an incredible loue of his ſubiects, and all other his followers, which is the faireſt and mightieſt fortreſſe that princes may haue, and which maketh their memorie moſt famous and happie with the poſteritie: He is, I ſay, like vnto a ſecond Traian euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Catholikes, beloued, no leſſe for his goodneſſe and clemencie, then for his valiancie.</p>
            <p>Thus in my opinion I haue ſufficiently anſwered concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the pretence of Religion which they might make you take hold of, which alſo beareth more ſemblance then truth, how much wiſelier haue your late father and your ſelfe dealt in forbearing forciblie, and by conſtraint to reclaime your poore inhabitants of the valley of Angrongne and other their neighbours, who neuertheleſſe are but one handfull of people in reſpect of theſe of Daulphine whome you doe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile. Content your ſelfe therefore with the ſame eſtate wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hitherto your ſelfe, and before you your late father found

eaſe. For vnder what colour would you at this day, in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine land, fight againſt a Religion which theſe thirtie yeares haue beene tollerated in your owne Countries. Rather bee you a beholder of the ſtorme that beateth and tormenteth the ſea of France: expect the iſſue of that tragedie: either, if you bee ſo deſirous to purchaſe reputation, conuert your meanes and forces towarde your father in lawe the king of Spaine, for the recouerie of the low Countries: and, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the phiſition, which comming to the ende of the ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is vſually the happieſt, and carieth away the credite of the cure, ſith the Duke of Alua, the great commaunder, and the prince of Parma could not yet atchieue the victorie, get you the honour of finiſhing it: ſo doing you ſhall trauaile in a better title, and your weapons ſhall bee more honourablie and better employed, beſides that you ſhall not incurre the vice and reputation of ingratitude to your benefactors: you ſhall warrant your poore ſubiects from the affliction and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion that warres doe vſuallie bring. And if zeale of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth lead and ſo mightilie mooue you, you may there fight againſt contrarie Religions which haue beene long there, and are in diuerſe points different from yours. There ſhall you find the Engliſh, againſt whom the Catholike Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie is at open warre, who durſt fauor and vndertake the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Hollanders and Zealanders, who firſt offering themſelues to the French king (who was more religious and carefull in keeping his league and peace with Spaine) were refuſed. For my part I will pray vnto the Creator for the proſperitie and encreaſe of your highneſſe, as</p>
