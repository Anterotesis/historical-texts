         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

all of them conteining matter of vntruth: As the memories
of ſuperstitious foundations, lies and Fables, fooliſhly medled
and compacted togither: written rather in the maintenance
and fauour of lewd miſdemeanor, of Superſtition, of Idolatry,
and do rather giue encouragement to wicked Subiects to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

and his Maieſties gracious proceedings, but alſo ſetting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the wide gate that leadeth to many miſdemeanors againſt

much importing his Maiesties ſeruice, to do my beſt endeuor
to ſtop this gap thus broken downe, that thus openeth the way

rents, or reuennewes; I haue not heaped to my ſelfe, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Offices or Church-liuinges: yet ſomething I haue
noted of the Countrey by obſeruation. I ſee a number of
good people, that are both capable of obedience &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
if they were not miſled: but their minds (alas)
are ſtill poyſoned with Popery, and what is he that it not
touched with a kinde of compaſsion, to ſee the poore &amp;
ſilly people ſo ſeduced &amp; carried away by theſe iuggling
<hi>Ieſuites?</hi> What monſtrous miracles are there daily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented,
and how many lying woonders are there to bee
witneſſed, teſtified by men ſcarce worth to bee credited,
and yet with what confidence are they receiued and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued?</p>
            <p>I haue yet once againe betaken me to my penne, and I
haue writ ſomething. I know not what my ſelfe: he that
would vnderſtand it, let him read a Gods name, he ſhall
finde I haue dealt plainly, without welt or gard.</p>
            <p>I woulde not haue it thought, that I make any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> in reſpect of their
birth, for I know there be as woorthy men in <hi>Ireland,</hi> as
any are in <hi>England,</hi> though not in ſuch generality, nor ſo
many in number: neyther is that to be wondered at, for
there are many reaſons to enduce it: So I know, there are
too many of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that are planted in all the parts
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that are no leſſe ſuperſtitious, no leſſe Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous,
nor no leſſe contentious both to God and the K.
<pb facs="tcp:16398:5"/>
then the moſt wilde or ſauage Iriſh man, that neuer came
in place where to learne good or bad.</p>
            <p>It is not therefore either the Countrey or the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman,
that maketh me either to loue or hate, it is their
manners and conditions that maketh mee both to prayſe
or diſpraiſe.</p>
            <p>As M. <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> therefore in his deſcription of Ireland,
in the 8. Chapter, diſcourſing of the manners and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
of the <hi>Meere Iriſh</hi> (for ſo hee tearmeth them) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he entereth into the matter, fore-warneth his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
not to impute any barbarous cuſtome, that he ſhold
there ſpeake of to the Cittizens, Towneſ-men, or to the
Inhabitants of the Engliſh pale, for that he reputeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to be men of another ſpirit, better trained vp in ſcience,
knowledge, ciuility, in curteſie, and ſuch other like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
of humanity. Let mee intreat the like fauour,
that hauing now occaſion to ſpeake of the manners and
cuſtomes of the Iriſh, do not thinke me yet to be ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
but that I doe make a great difference, betweene
thoſe that are rude, vnciuill, vnreuerent, vncleanly, and
vntaught, and thoſe other againe that are milde, modeſt,
mercifull, kinde, curteous, and that are euery way indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with wit, reaſon, and vnderſtanding. And I do make
the like exceptions betweene thoſe that are irreligious,
ſuperſtitious, Idolatrous, ſeditious, rebellious; that doe
retaine Ieſuites, Seminaries, and other Traiterous prieſts,
then of thoſe, that contrariwiſe are profeſſors of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
that do embrace the holy Scriptures, and do inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
themſelues in the ſeruice of their God, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to their Prince.</p>
            <p>Now, for theſe men of little wit, and leſſe vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that becauſe by the Text of the holy ſcriptures, I
haue hunted their Pope from Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, to the
ſeat of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> would therefore conclude, that I were
an enemy to Ireland; let them vnderſtand, that I loue
Ireland, and that I thinke there is as neere a high way to
go to Heauen from out of Ireland, as there is from any
<pb facs="tcp:16398:6"/>
part of England, or elſe my ſelfe would neuer haue ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſo long in the Countrey. Now, for the people, they
are in Ireland, as in all other places, ſome good, ſome
bad, yet more rude &amp; vnciuil in Ireland, then they be in
any part of the worlde that is known: but for Poperie (I
proteſt) they are more fooliſh-ſuperſtitious in Irelande,
then they be in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe. But I do therefore, rather
pitty, then malice them; there be a great many of known
Papiſts in <hi>Dublyne,</hi> that I doe loue, and wiſh well vnto:
for, may not a man loue a papiſt, as hee loueth a friend
that is diſeaſed? Admit I had a Brother that were viſited
with <hi>Morbus Galicus</hi> it ſelfe, might I not loue him, and
hate his ſickneſſe both at once? Euen ſo I loue a papiſt,
I loue the party, when I defie his Religion. But Popery
is a malady not eaſie to be cured, and I thinke theſe lines
of mine will ſooner moue Choller, then giue content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or produce amendment. And yet as I meane not
in this my <hi>Deſcription of Ireland,</hi> to buſie my ſelfe about
any matters of State, ſo I will not meddle with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery
of any hidden ſecrets, that may bee brought into
any queſtion of doubt, for the truth and certainty: for, as
I haue vſed no other helpe then mine owne experience,
ſo my beſt method ſhall be, to ſpeake nothing but what
is true, and ſo to be approoued. If there be any excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
taken by Fooles that be ignorant, I hope the wiſe &amp;
learned will make no worſe conſtruction then the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doth import: for the reſt that bee of a wrangling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
let them do as they haue done, fret and fume at
that which they are not able to contradict: let them ioyn
impudencie to their ignorance, and becauſe they cannot
comprehend the ſincerity of true religion, let them carpe
and cauill againſt it, and let them neuer ſpare.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Orthy Gentleman, if the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
were to be merited by a mans owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruings
(as a number of Groſſe-headed Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
will not let to affirme) you were then
happy, for you neither needed to purchaſe
any <hi>Popes Pardons,</hi> or to buy any <hi>Maſſes</hi> of <hi>Scala Celi,</hi> to
be ſung for your ſoule when you are dead.</p>
            <p>You haue begun a worke of <hi>Supererogation,</hi> more merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
in the iudgements of all thoſe that are (indeed) godly
wiſe, then either the building of a <hi>Chappel,</hi> or a <hi>Chantery,</hi>
or the giuing of perpetuities, either of lands or liuings, what
or how ſoeuer beſtowed about any Popiſh purpoſes.</p>
            <p>This enterprize, the rather by your encouragement thus
vndertaken, for the planting of the Northerne parts of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> cannot be but acceptable in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God, when it ſhall draw ſo much to the aduancement
of his glory, making way for the <hi>Goſpell</hi> of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> to
be truely preached in a place where there was nothing but I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry
and ſuperſtition formerly practiſed; giuing light and
vnderſtanding to a blind and ignorant people, to diſcern the
way of ſaluation, that do rather hope to be ſaued by the means
of <hi>Saint Patricke,</hi> then by the mercy of God.</p>
            <p>This action cannot be but pleaſing to the Kings moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Maieſty, when the ſequell ſhall not redound to his honor,
but likewiſe to his profit: But how happily will it fall out for a
<pb facs="tcp:16398:7"/>
number of poore people in <hi>England,</hi> that are oppreſſed with
penury, by reaſon of the multitude that doth ſo ſuperabound,
whereby the ſcarſity of victuals doth the more exceede, that
may there be releeued by their owne industry: for Ireland is
able to render relecfe to forty thouſand people, but to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in thoſe parts of the Countrey, that at this preſent lyeth
wast, and altogether vninhabited: and yet where the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
is beſt planted and peopled throughout the whole realme,
the thirde part of the commodity is not raiſed, that the ſoile
would affoord: the reaſon is, by the ill Husbandry of the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,</hi>
that either for want of wit, or for want of knowledge,
doth not mannage their Husbandry according to skill.</p>
            <p>And although it be out of my element to ſpeake of husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry,
that all the dayes of my life, could neuer play the good
Husband for my ſelfe: yet I am not ſo dull of conceite, but
I can ſee a number of defects, and that in the moſt principall
points of their Husbandry; as in the manner of the Tilling of
their ground, and ſowing of their Corne, they haue no other
meanes whereby to draw the Plough, but euery Horſe by his
owne taile, ſo that when the poore beaſt by his painfull labor,
hath worne the haire of his taile ſo ſhort, as it can bee no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
tied, the Plough muſt ſtand.</p>
            <p>I might ſpeake of many other defects, and one amongst the
reſt, of the vnſeaſonable time that they vſe in the making of
their Hay: but to ſpeak truely of their ill Husbandry in that
point: in the greateſt part throughout all Ireland, they vſe to
make no Hay at all, although they haue as good grounde
as any other Countrey doth affoord: ſo that their poore Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in the Winter ſeaſon, haue no other fother, then what they
can picke vp, and gather from the ground: but in thoſe parts
neere about <hi>Dublyne,</hi> where they vſe to make Hay, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
meddle with the cutting of their graſſe, till they bee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ready to cut their Corn, ſo that they wil haue their Hay
harueſt, and their Corne harueſt, to come both together,
which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly neuer falleth out, till September be wel ſpent:
at which time of the yeare, there ſometimes falleth out great
ſtore of raine, ſo that from the beſt Meddow Lands, which is
<pb facs="tcp:16398:7"/>
euermore vpon their lower grounds, their hay is many times
either vtterly marred, or altogither ſwept away with a floud.</p>
            <p>I might heere conclude and boldly affirme, that if thoſe
parts of <hi>Ireland</hi> that now lieth waſt, were inhabited by an
induſtrious people, and that the reſt of the Countrey were
manured aud husbanded according to skill, <hi>Ireland</hi> woulde
ſuſtaine more people by two parts, then are now inhabiting in
it. But leauing to ſpeake of <hi>Ireland</hi> in generall, I will come
to that part of the North now intended to be planted, namely
of the <hi>Derry</hi> and the <hi>Colrane.</hi> In the time of Sir <hi>Iohn Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi>
Gouernment, I my ſelfe lay at <hi>Colrane,</hi> with a hunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſouldiers vnder my leading, I may therefore ſpeake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of mine owne experience.</p>
            <p>For the Land that is adioyning about <hi>Colrane,</hi> it is verie
firtill, and the whol Countrey that ſtretcheth it ſelfe between
the Riuer of <hi>Bande,</hi> and the riuer of <hi>Lough-foile,</hi> that was
ſometimes <hi>O-Cannes</hi> Countrey, is not onely a moſt pleaſant
place, but is likewiſe verie commodious both for Corne and
Paſture.</p>
            <p>On the South ſide of the riuer of <hi>Bande,</hi> faſt by <hi>Colrane,</hi>
there lieth a goodly country, called the <hi>Rowt,</hi> no better Corn
land in any part of Ireland, and it did at that time ſo abound
with Conies, ſo exceeding fat, and therewithall ſo ſweete, as
I neuer ſaw the like, neither in Ireland, nor in any other
place where I haue trauailed.</p>
            <p>What ſhould I ſpeake of the <hi>Salmon</hi> fiſhing of the <hi>Bande,</hi>
which is ſo famouſly known and ſpoken of: and there is more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
for three moneths of the yeare, betweene <hi>September</hi> &amp;
<hi>December,</hi> ſuch a fiſhing for Eeles, as I thinke is not the
like againe in <hi>Europe,</hi> eſpecially when there ſhall come men
that hath skill to take them, which the Iriſh hath not to any
purpoſe, yet they take great ſtore, by reaſon of the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
of ſuch notable Eeles, both for greatneſſe and for
goodneſſe, as the like are no other where elſe to be found.</p>
            <p>I might ſpeake heere of the fiſhing for freſh water Trowts,
whereof there are great plentie in euery Riuer, in euerie
Brooke, in euerie Lough, and that throughout the whole
<pb facs="tcp:16398:8"/>
Realme of Ireland, but ſpeciallie in thoſe Northerne partes
about Colrane and the Derry.</p>
            <p>But let me ſpeake now of the fiſhing for Sea-fiſh, and firſt
for Cod and Lyng: what ſhippes are yearely ſet out from all
the parts of England: ſome to New-found-land, ſome to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
ſome to <hi>Shotland,</hi> ſome to <hi>Ward-houſe,</hi> ſome to one
place and ſome to another: and I thinke of my conſcience,
that at the verie entrance aſwell of the riuer of the <hi>Bande,</hi>
as of the Riuer of <hi>Lough-foyle,</hi> which are not aboue ſome
eight or ten miles distant, there will fall out as good fiſhing
both for <hi>Cod</hi> and <hi>Lyng,</hi> as in any other place that I haue
formerly ſpoken of.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Herring</hi>-fiſhing, who can name a better place
then <hi>Loughfoyle</hi> it ſelfe, and there is one other <hi>Loughe</hi>
fast by, called by the name of <hi>Lough-Sully,</hi> where hee that
were but ſtanding vpon the ſhore at the time of <hi>Herring</hi>-fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing,
would thinke that the very Sea it ſelfe did ſwell of her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
there are ſuch abundance all along that Coast.</p>
            <p>Without doubt, there will be found good fiſhing for <hi>Ray,</hi>
for <hi>Haddock,</hi> for <hi>Whiting,</hi> for <hi>Gurnard,</hi> and for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of other fiſhe, which neuer faileth all along the Coaſt of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> if it be ſought for.</p>
            <p>As I haue now ſpoken of fiſhing, ſo I might yet again ſpeak
of fowling: but let it ſuffice, that aſwell for fiſh, for foule, for
Conics, for Cattle, and whatſoeuer is otherwiſe needefull
for mans ſuſtenance, the whole Realme of <hi>Ireland</hi> is as rich
and fertile as any other Countrey in Christendom: yea and
for all manner of fruites: as <hi>Apples, peares,</hi> &amp; <hi>plums,</hi> in
manie parts of the Countrey, where men haue bin induſtrious
to plant, they haue as good fruit in <hi>Ireland</hi> as anie is in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude, there wanteth nothing in <hi>Ireland</hi> but the
true knowledge of God, &amp; obedience to the Prince, the which
by Gods permiſſion, will ſo much the rather bee brought to a
good paſſe, when that part of the Countrey that in former a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
hath bin most rude and inclined to inciuilitie, that hath
<pb facs="tcp:16398:8"/>
euermore bin the receptacle and refuge for the worst diſpoſed
people, ſhall by this <hi>Plantation,</hi> be made a patterne of good
example, aſwell for Godly as Ciuill Gouernment, to all the
Realme beſides: but there is a kind of temeritie that doth no
good, yet is conueyed by thoſe men, that are vtterly ignorant
in the affaires of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since my comming from <hi>Dublyn,</hi> within ſixe daies after
my arriuall here at <hi>London,</hi> I thinke I was asked ſixteene
ſeuerall times, what I thoght of this <hi>Plantation</hi> in the north
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and whether it were poſſible that thoſe labouerers
and workmen that are now ſent ouer for the building, coulde
ſaue their throats from cutting, or their heades from beeing
taken from their ſhoulders, before the worke were finiſhed: or
what aſſurance there could bee, but that when this erection
were fullie perfected, and that men did thinke themſelus to be
most quietly ſetled: why might not the <hi>Iriſh</hi> do then as they
had done before, in one night to lay wast and conſume al with
fire and ſword? So that I ſee there be a number that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,
but it is but of their owne ſhadowes.</p>
            <p>But let timerous men doubt as they liſt, and let igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt
men write what they pleaſe: <hi>Ireland</hi> (God be praiſed)
is in no ſuch daungerous manner of plight. That doubt is
diſſolued, and the daunger is past: for menne may worke as
quietlie in thoſe places wherevnto they are now ſent, as they
might doe if they were in <hi>Cheapeſide.</hi> And in that part of
the Countrey, through the which a thouſand menne in times
paſt would haue beene intercepted, I dare now vndertake to
paſſe my ſelfe and my Boy.</p>
            <p>But there be ſome will ſaie: And why may it not come to
paſſe, that there may be as great daunger as euer there was,
and that the Iriſh may be as Potent to execute miſchiefe, as
euer they haue bin before?</p>
            <p>I ſay, They cannot. And whoſoeuer ſhall pleaſe to read
the ſequele heerein contained, I hope ſhall be fullie ſatisfied
in that point, for onelie to that ende and purpoſe, I haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured
theſe Lines. And all the matter that I ayme at
<pb facs="tcp:16398:9"/>
throughout this whole Booke, is but to make it manifeſt, that
the Iriſh are of no ſuch reſistance at this houre againſt his
Maiestie, as they haue beene in times past against our late
Queene.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant, that although Ireland be reduced to a
great conformitie, and that his Maieſtie hath a number of
loyall and faithfull Subiects in euery part of that Kingdome,
yet I know againe there be ſome, that are not to be trusted,
and therefore I ſpeake not of their mindes, but I ſpeake of
their manners: And I ſay, that the <hi>Rebel of Ireland</hi> ſhall
neuer more ſtand out hereafter, as they haue done in times
paſt.</p>
            <p>If any man pleaſe to read, let him iudge of my reaſons,
in the meane time, there is but one thing (worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
that is to be feared, and may very eaſily be holpen, if
you ſuffer no Papiſt (either Engliſh or Iriſh) to plant himſelf
among you. Looke well but to that, and there is no doubt but
the Almightie God himſelfe will bleſſe your enterpriſe, and
England and Ireland both, ſhall hereafter call you happy, &amp;
I ſhall rest ſtill to wiſh you well.</p>

themſelues to nothing elſe, but to feed &amp; delight
them with matter moſt diſhoneſt and ſhamefull:
for in their ſpeaking and writing, they do nothing
but flatter them in their vngracious humours, ſtill
opening the way with lying praiſes of their proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors,
what Rebellions they haue ſtirred vp, and
how many miſchiefes they haue performed; this
is ſuch a whetſtone to their ambitious deſires, and
being thus made drunke with theſe lying reportes
of their Aunceſtors worthineſſe, that they thinke
themſelues to be reproched for euer, if they ſhould
not be as apt &amp; ready to run into al manner of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
as their fathers were afore them. From
hence it commeth, that being thus drowned in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
they thinke it to be the true high-way to
happineſſe, for euery man to do what hee liſt, and
do therefore ſeeke to free themſelues from Lawe,
Iuſtice, and reaſon, becauſe they would not be bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled,

for any memorable matter, the more it hath
bin repleniſhed with horrible murthers, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

worthy to be followed, but Tragedies of crueltie,
fit to be abhorred.</p>
               <p>One of the greateſt felicities wherewith <hi>Ireland</hi>

of the Climate, vnder the which it is adia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
I ſay, we do not find <hi>Ireland</hi> to be cold in the
winter, nor ſo hot in the Summer, as it is in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
The froſts in <hi>Ireland,</hi> are neither ſo harde nor
of that continuance as they be in <hi>England,</hi> and yet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16398:11"/>
the Countrey is verie cold, with a kind of rawiſh
moiſture, but not ſo nipping, nor dureable, as the
dry cold that commonly coms with froſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ireland</hi> is wonderfully inclined to fogs &amp; miſts,
and giuen to very much raine, aſwell in ſummer as
in winter, and the Countrey is full of ſprings, and
great currants of water that fals from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
which with a ſhewer of raine will riſe verie
ſuddenly, and will fall againe as quickly when the
weather cleareth vp.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ireland</hi> is full of great Riuers, and mightie huge
Loughes, ſuch as we call <hi>Meeres</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are many large and ſpacious Iſlands, where the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> haue many times fortified themſelues againſt
the Prince, but are ſtill ferreted and drawne out by
the eares, though other whiles with great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
To ſpeake of <hi>Ireland</hi> generally, it is repleniſhed
with Riuers, with Woods, with Bogs, and with
as good lande, both for corne and paſture, as any
<hi>Europe</hi> affoords; but not ſo well manvred, nor ſo
well husbanded: for the Farmers of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are far
to ſeeke in many pointes of good husbandry, and
the women (for the moſt part) haue as little skill
of huſwifery.</p>
               <p>From hence I might affirme, and confidentlie
conclude, that throughout the whole Realme of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> what betweene the ill husbandrie of that
which is inhabited, and ſo much of the Countrey
againe lying waſt for want of Inhabitants, there is
not the third part of that profit raiſed, that Irelaud
would affoord.</p>
               <p>For fiſh, for foule, for Conies, they are very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16398:12"/>
throughout all the partes of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and for
red-Deare, they haue them vpon the mountayns,
but not in ſuch plenty as I my ſelfe haue knowne.
Fallow deare are not ſo common, vnleſſe it bee in
ſome few Parkes.</p>
               <p>To be ſhort, there is nothing wanting in <hi>Ireland</hi>
that is behouefull for the ſuſtinance of man, yet I
dare not ſtretch ſo far as M. <hi>Stanihurſt,</hi> that would
haue Ireland the <hi>Treaſure-houſe</hi> of the world, as he
hath publiſhed in his Booke, I will not ſay how
vainely or how vnwiſely. Let other men iudge of
that, but I thinke he meaneth of hidden Treaſures
that are not yet diſcouered. It is truth, there are
ſome ſmall ſtore of Pearle now and then found,
chopt vppon by chance, but not in ſuch abundance
that they bee worthy to be ſo ſpoken of, nor thoſe
few that be found, are neither ſo oryent, ſo praiſe
worthy, nor of ſuch price and eſtimation, as thoſe
that are brought from other places, both from the
Eaſt and Weſt Indies, and yet I once ſaw an Iriſh
Pearle that was ſould for xv. pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. I neuer heard of
any Mines either of Gold, or Siluer, or Copper, or
Tinne, or Leade, or of any other Minerall matter
that was found in the Countrey, that would quit
the charge in refining; but to ſpeake truly, the Iriſh
are ſo malicious that they wil not ſuffer men of art
and ſkill to make ſearch for them: One of the beſt
Mines that is knowne to bee in Ireland, is that of
Iron, which is very rich (indeed) if it would hold
out, or that there were any ſtore of the Oore to be
found, as like enough it would do if the Iriſh
would giue men leaue to ſeeke for it. It is many
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16398:12"/>
yeares agoe ſince I heard talke of an Allum Mine
that was found, and great hope was had of profit
and commodity, but how it was left, I know not, I
thinke by the vnwillingneſſe of the bad diſpoſed
people of that Countrey, that will neuer (by their
good willes) ſuffer men to worke with their heades
vppon their ſhoulders. Ireland (without doubt) is a
fruitfull Countrey, and it yeildeth in moſt abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
maner, all conuenient neceſſaries that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houefull
for humaine ſuſtinance, but to hope after
Mines and Minerals in Ireland, I thinke there is no
ſuch likeli-hood, for thoſe are euermore to bee
ſought after, in thoſe Countries that are warme,
or at the leaſt very dry, but not in thoſe places that
are ſo ouercharged with raine, and ſo much giuen
to moiſture as <hi>Ireland.</hi>

The inclination of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> people is, to bee Religious,
franke, amorous, yrefull, ſufferable of infinite paines,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16398:13"/>
very glorious, many Sorcerers, excellent Horſemen, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted

of Deuotion, in compariſon of them. As for abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
and Faſting, it is to them a familiar kinde of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticement.
They follow the dead Corps to the graue with
howling and barbarous out-cries, pittiful in apparance,
whereof grew (<hi>as I ſuppoſe</hi>) the prouerbe; <hi>To weep
Iriſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus farre haue I cited, what Maiſter <hi>Stanihurſt</hi>
himſelfe hath publiſhed of the diſpoſition of the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> whereunto they are inclined. And now (not
to impugne any thing that Maiſter <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> hath
written) I will yet once againe take a ſuperficiall
ſuruey of what hee hath ſet downe, and will giue
him mine opinion, what I doe thinke of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p>And firſt, he ſaith [<hi>They are Religious</hi>] I ſay, It is
truth, but I would to God it were according vnto
knowledge. [<hi>They are franke,</hi>] Neither will I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
that, for the Iriſh are beneuolent enough
among their friendes and acquaintance. [<hi>they are
Amorous</hi>] I thinke he meaneth to women: but if
he ſpeaketh in generall, I ſay and affirme, that the
greateſt number of the Iriſh, are vtterly ignoraunt
what honeſt Loue doth meane. [<hi>They are yrefull</hi>]
the more is the pitty, for it hath coſt the price of
much Chriſtian bloud. [<hi>They are ſufferable of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
paines</hi>] but yet at any hand they wil not, or can
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16398:13"/>
cannot indure to labonr, for there is not a greater
plague-ſore to Ireland, then the ydleneſſe thereof.
[<hi>They are very glorious</hi>] very true; and they are no
leſſe proud, for the meaneſt Shackerell, that hath
ſcarce a mantle to wrap himſelfe in, hath as proud
a mind as <hi>Oneal</hi> himſelfe, when he ſits vpon a green
banke vnder a buſh in his greateſt maieſty. [<hi>There
are many Sorcerers</hi>] and the Countrey doth no leſſe
abound with <hi>Witches;</hi> and no maruel that it ſhould
ſo do, for the Deuill hath euer bin moſt frequent
and conuerſant amongſt Infidels, Turks, Papiſtes,
&amp; ſuch other, that doe neither know nor loue god,
then he can be amongſt thoſe that are the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of the Goſpell of Chriſt. [<hi>They are excellent
horſemen</hi>] yet good for nothing but for the ſeruice
in Ireland. [<hi>They are delighted with warres</hi>] they are
delighted with Rebellions, Commotions, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections;
but they cannot be called wars, that
are ſtirred vp by ſubiects againſt their Prince. [<hi>They
are great Almeſ-giuers,</hi>] I neuer heard any great
commendation of their Almeſ-giuing, in any ſuch
generallitie, vnleſſe it were to a Fryer, a Prieſt, or
to ſome other of that annointed Order. [<hi>Paſsing in
Hoſpitalitie,</hi>] I would be loath to barre the <hi>Iriſh</hi> of
that right; for to giue them their due, they are as
bountifull of their meate and drinke, as any other
Nation in <hi>Europe</hi> whatſoeuer. [<hi>The lewder ſort both
Clarks and Lai-men, ſenſual &amp; ouer-looſe in liuing,</hi>] By
that ſame word [<hi>Clarkes</hi>] ſo ioyned with the <hi>Laity,</hi>
I thinke he meanes the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clergy, which he ſaith
are of laſciuious and loſe liuing: hee might haue
added farther, that the greateſt number of them
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16398:14"/>
are trayterous Prieſts, proteſted Enemies to their
Prince, and ſo vowed to their Pope; [<hi>The ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

holineſſe and auſterity, that other Nations retaine but a
ſhaddow of Deuotion, in compariſon of them.</hi>]</p>
               <p>A proud praiſe, that the holy ones of Ireland
ſhould ſo farre out-ſtretch all the holineſſe in the
world beſides: but I will not contradict M. <hi>Stani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt;</hi>
for without doubt he ſpake but as he thoght:
And heere wee may ſee, that theſe lying ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thus publiſhed by our Iriſh Writers, haue led
the people into ſuch a blind arrogancy, that they
will admit nothing for truth, but what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
from their owne Authors, or gather out of
their owne bookes; And now it followeth.</p>
               <p>[<hi>As for Abſtinency and Faſting, it is to them a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
kind of Chaſtiſement.</hi>] I thinke this Abſtinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Faſting, is the holineſſe which Maiſter <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihurſt</hi>
hath formerly ſpoken of, for this is a viſible
holineſſe (indeede) which euery man may ſee and
wonder at: for let mee ſpeake of the moſt abiect
Creatures, that I think either <hi>Ireland</hi> or the world
affoordeth, and thoſe are the <hi>Kearne of Ireland,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom, there is not ſo notable a wretch to
bee found, that will not obſerue his faſting daies,
three daies in a weeke at the leaſt, and thoſe are
Wedneſdaies, Fridaies, and Saturdaies: then they
haue other <hi>Vigiles,</hi> and ſuch Saint <hi>Eeues,</hi> as I neuer
heard of but in Ireland, nor I thinke be knowne in
any other place, which they obſerue and keepe
with ſuch religious zeale and deuotion, that I am
ſure Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe cannot be more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:16398:14"/>
ceremonious then theſe bee, nor ſhew himſelfe to
be more holy, nor more honeſt; yet that very day,
that for conſcience ſake, they will abſtaine from
eating of Fleſh, Butter, Cheeſe, Milk, Egges, and
ſuch like, that very houre they will not forbeare
to ſpoile, to robbe, to rauiſh, to murther, nor to
commit any other villany, what or howſoeuer.</p>
               <p>And let mee ſay ſomething for our Females in
Ireland, and leauing to ſpeake of woorthy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones,
and of thoſe Women that are honeſt,
good, and vertuous, (as Ireland Good bee thanked
is not deſtitute of many ſuch) I will ſpeake onelie
of the riffe-raffe, the moſt filthy Queanes, that are
knowne to bee in the Countrey, (I meane thoſe
Huſwiues that doe vſe ſelling of drinke in <hi>Dubline,</hi>
or elſe where) commonly called <hi>Tauerne-keepers,</hi>
but indeed filthy and beaſtly <hi>Alehouſekeepers:</hi> I will
not meddle with their honeſties, I will leaue that
to be teſtified by Maiſter <hi>Maior of the Bull-ring,</hi> but
otherwiſe for the greateſt number of them (for
God defend that I ſhould condemne them al) they
are in the manner of their life and liuing to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
and abhorred: yet on their preſcribed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
daies, if there bee any ſanctity in abſtaining
from fleſh, from Butter, from Cheeſe, from Milk,
from Egges, they are as holy (I dare vndertake) as
the Pope himſelfe, and why not as honeſt? This is
the holineſſe which (I thinke) M. <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> hath
ſo highly commended to be in the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> And this is
to be lamented, that the poor people of that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
ſhould bee ſo ſeduced and made beleeue, that
their faſting, their praying in Latine, their running
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16398:15"/>
wels and to other Idolatrous places, is a full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for any ſins that they can commit, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable
or abhominable ſoeuer; for thus they are
taught, and ſo they beleeue.</p>
               <p>But is not this a madde manner of faſting, that
marcheth in equall manner with Theft, with mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
with Treaſon, with drunkennes, with whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and with all manner of Sodometry? but the
cauſe of all thinges muſt needes tell whoſe childe
the effect is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now laſtly, M.</hi> Stanihurſt <hi>ſeemeth to find fault
at the manner of the Iriſh burials, and ſayth;</hi> They
follow the dead corps to the graue, with houling and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
outcries pittifull in apparance, whereof grew (<hi>as
I ſuppoſe</hi>) the Prouerbe <hi>To weepe Iriſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think it would be admired in any part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom,
to ſee the manners of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> how they
vſe to carry their dead to their graues, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
partes of the Countrey; to a ſtraunger that
had neuer ſeen the ſight before, at the firſt encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
would beleeue that a company of <hi>Hags</hi> or <hi>hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Fiendes,</hi> were carrying a dead body to ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall
Manſion; for what with the vnſeemlineſſe
of their ſhewes, and the il-faring noyſe they doe
make, with their howling and crying, an ignorant
man would ſooner beleeue they were Deuils of
Hell, then Chriſtian people. But as M. <hi>Stanihurſt</hi>
ſaith; [<hi>it is pittifull in appearance:</hi>] pittifull indeed,
that a people ſo many yeares profeſſing Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
ſhould yet ſhew themſelues more Heathen
like, then thoſe, that neuer heard of God.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> farther ſuppoſeth, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16398:15"/>
                  <hi>to weepe Iriſh,</hi> had heere the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
It may be ſo, and it is troth, that in Citties
and Townes where any deceaſeth that is of worth
or worthineſſe, they wil hyre a number of women
to bring the corps to the place of buriall, that for
ſome ſmall recompence giuen them, will furniſh
the cry, with greater ſhriking and howling, then
thoſe that are grieued indeede, and haue greateſt
cauſe to cry; and herevpon ariſeth this Prouerbe,
<hi>to weepe Iriſh,</hi> that is to ſay; To weepe at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
without cauſe, or griefe.</p>
               <p>Heere is thus much more to be conſidered, that
notwithſtanding this vnchriſtian-like demeanour
of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that in their burials do ſhew themſelus
like Infidels, repugnant to all Chriſtianity, there
is neither <hi>Ieſuite, Seminary,</hi> nor Popiſh prieſt, (that
do ſo ſwarme in the Countrey,) that wil once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke
or find fault at the matter. But they are not
to be blamed, for the Popes doctrine hath no ſuch
operation, to draw men from darkneſſe to light;
but it ſerueth rather to hood-winke them, or put
out both the eies, and ſo make them ſtarke blind.</p>

               <p>I Remember, there was ſometime one <hi>Alan Cope,</hi>
who hath written of many matters, who, if a

yet writing againſt that fooliſh conceit houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16398:16"/>
by the Iriſh, that Ireland was purged from ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous
wormes, by the only praiers of S. <hi>Patrick,</hi>
was therefore complained on, and accuſed by M.
<hi>Stanihurſt,</hi> that <hi>Cope</hi> had wronged and ſlaundered
the whole <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation.</p>
               <p>I hope I ſhal not be ſo dealt withal, that bicauſe
I haue detected and reproued the vnciuill demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
of thoſe that bee blame-worthy, I ſhall not
therefore be exclaimed on, to be an open deprauer
of all that whole Nation.</p>
               <p>I proteſt, I do know neuer a man in Ireland that
I do hate, or that I do wiſh any harme vnto, and
therfore if I hapen to glance at the abuſes of thoſe
that be ill, let not thoſe that be good think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
thereby to be detected, or ſo much as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.
But as the throng of fooles, doth euermore
exceed the number of the wiſe, ſo the multitude of
the rude and ignorant among the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> do far paſſe
the number either of the religious, or ciuilly refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
I do not hold, that euery Citizen or townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
that liueth in common ſociety, is therefore to
be accounted ciuill; neither doth it follow, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
man inhabiting the Countrey, is therefore to
be called vnciuill; for ciuillity and vnciuilitie, hath
no relation to the Citty or Countrey, but it hath
conſideration to the manners and conditions of
men, that are therfore to be accounted ciuil or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuill,
according to the diſpoſitions of the mind.</p>
               <p>All the Countries that are knowne (eſpeciallie
in <hi>Europe</hi>) haue their ſeuerall inclinations aſwel to
vertue as vice: We ſay, the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> are politike

the crown of the head, to the ſole of the foot. And
although that in the remote places, the vnciuill
ſort ſo disfigure themſelues with their <hi>Glybs,</hi> their
<hi>Trowes,</hi> and their miſhapen attire, yet they appear
to euery mans eye to be men of good proportion,
of comely ſtature, and of able body. Now to ſpeak
of their diſpoſitions, whereunto they are adicted
and inclined. I ſay, beſides they are rude, vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and vnciuill, ſo they are very cruell, bloudie
minded, apt and ready to commit any kind of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe.
I do not impute this ſo much to their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
inclination, as I do to their education, that are
trained vp in Treaſon, in Rebellion, in Theft, in
Robery, in Superſtition, in Idolatry, and nuzeled
from their Cradles in the very puddle of Popery.</p>
               <p>This is the fruits of the Popes doctrine, that doth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:16398:17"/>
preach cruelty, that doth admit of murthers and
bloudy executions; by poiſoning, ſtabbing, or by
any other maner of practiſe hoſoeuer: the pope
teacheth ſubiects to reſiſt, to mutinie, and to rebel
againſt their Princes.</p>
               <p>From hence it proceedeth, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> haue
euer beene, and ſtill are, deſirous to ſhake off the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> gouernment.</p>
               <p>From hence it doth proceed, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> can
not endure to loue the Engliſh, bicauſe they differ
ſo much in Religion.</p>
               <p>From hence it proceedeth, that as they cannot
indure to loue the Engliſh, ſo they cannot be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to loue any thing that doth come from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh;
according to the prouerbe, <hi>Loue me, and loue
my Dog:</hi> ſo contrariwiſe, he that hateth me, hateth
in like manner all that commeth from me.</p>
               <p>From hence it is, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had rather ſtil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
themſelues in their ſluttiſhneſſe, in their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanlineſſe,
in their rudeneſſe, and in their inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
loathſomnes, then they would take any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
from the Engliſh, either of <hi>ciuility, humanity,</hi>
or any manner of <hi>Decencie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ſee nowe the author of this enmity, is hee
that neuer did other good, where hee had to doe
with mens conſciences.</p>
               <p>There is yet a difference to bee made, of thoſe
faults that do grow from our weakneſſe, and thoſe
that do proceed from our mallice: and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in
this are the more to be pittied, that are no better
taught; whoſe educations, as they are rude, ſo they
are blinded with ignorance, and I thinke for deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:16398:17"/>
ſake, they haue made a vow to be ignorant.</p>
               <p>But although the vulgar ſort, through their dul
wits, and their brutiſh education, cannot conceiue
what is profitable for themſelues, and good for
their Countrey, yet there bee ſome other of that
Countrey birth, whoſe thoughts and mindes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inriched with knowledge and vnderſtanding,
that haue done good in the Country, and whoſe
example hereafter, may giue light to many others:
For I thinke, that if theſe people did once vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the pretiouſneſſe of vertue, they would farre
exceed vs; notwithſtanding, our long experience
in the Soueraignty of vertue.</p>

               <p>IT cannot be denayed, but that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are very

their diſpoſitions, the examples are to many,

               <p>But ſome will ſay, their cruelty doth not ſo much
proceede from that naturall inclination that is in

find that it is the Engliſh gouernment that ſtaieth
them from their bloudy executions, the one of

Queene was in nothing more troubled, then in
keeping them from perſecuting and proſecuting
the one the other, with fire, with ſword, and with
ſuch raging fury, that the moſt barbarous ſauages
that neuer knew ciuility, are not more tragicall in
their executions, then are the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time hath beene, when they liued like <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians,</hi>

without politique Law, or ciuil gouernment,
neither imbracing Religion, Lawe, nor mutuall

               <p>That which is hatefull to all the world beſides,
is onely beloued and imbraced by the Iriſh, I mean

               <p>The wilde vnciuill <hi>Seythians,</hi> doe forbeare to be

               <p>In ciuill broiles, euery baſe Raſcall is an equall

their libertie to do wrong, is no leſſe the one then

for the aid &amp; aſſiſtance of theſe licentious

routes that follow them: they therefore forbeare
no miſchiefe, abſtaining no more from that which
is holy, then from that which is prophane: neither
marriage nor honour ſo protect any, that Rape be
not mingled with murder, nor murder with Rape.</p>
               <p>All things are full of miſery in ciuill Wars, and
as in forraigne encounters, there is nothing more

               <p>Theſe ciuill furies, are by ſeuerall means ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:

               <p>Some will ſay that there is not a readier meane

               <p>Her Maieſty thought in being gracious, ſhe might

that was either befitting for a Prince to grant

mittigated the rigor of cruelty, what pardoning,
what protecting, and what tollerating of offences
that were daily and continualy committed againſt
her.</p>
               <p>But for the better diſcouery of their ingratitude
towardes her Maieſtie, how did ſhee continually
grace and countinance the Nobility of that realm,
not onely ſuffering them to triumph and tyranize
ouer their Tenants and followers, with ſuch priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges

of them requited her, it is ſo manifeſtly known, as
it were but loſt labour any further to rehearſe.</p>
               <p>How many Gentlemen againe of that country

               <p>I thinke the ingratitude of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> (conſidering

deſerueth no leſle to be condemned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</hi>

               <p>Not to requit a benefit receiued is ill, but this

               <p>But to ſpeake generally throughout the whole

ſhould be moſt neate and cleanely, they doe ſhew
themſelues to be moſt ſluttiſh and filthy; namely,
in making of their Butter, and waſhing of their
Linnen.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they do abuſe one of the greateſt bleſſings
of God beſtowed vpon that Country, for as God
promiſed the children of <hi>Iſraell</hi> to tranſport them
into a land that flowed with Milke and Honey, ſo
the plenty of milke throughout all the parts of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
doth ſo abound, that the greateſt part of the

and ſuſtained (both Summer and Winter) with
Milke and Butter; but according to the Prouerbe,
<hi>GOD ſendes meate, and the Deuill ſends Cookes;</hi> ſo,
it pleaſeth God to ſend them plenty of Milke, but
as they behaue themſelues in the vſing of it, it is
fit for no body but for themſelues, that are of the
vncleanly diet: not onely in their Milke and But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but in many other vnſauoury diſhes beſides.</p>
               <p>It is holden among the Iriſh, to bee a preſage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſome misfortune, to keepe their milking
veſſels cleanly, and that if they ſhould either ſcald
or waſh them, ſome vnlucky miſaduenture would
ſurely betide them: vpon this conceit, al the veſſels
that they vſe about their milke, are moſt filthily
kept: and I my ſelfe haue ſeene, that veſſell which
they hold vnder the Cow whilſt they are in mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
to be furred halfe an inch thicke with filth, ſo
that <hi>Dublyne</hi> it ſelf is ſerued euery Market day with

ſuch Butter, as I am ſure is much more loathſome
then toothſome.</p>
               <p>Now, in the manner of their waſhing, they are
yet more filthie then in any other of their exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
wherein they are moſt vncleanlie, and I do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
loath, but to thinke of their ſcouring ſtuffe
which they doe vſe in the ſtead of Sope; but hee

in their <hi>Nettyng</hi> (as they call it) would neuer
after ſtop his noſe, if he chanced to goe by where
they were ſcouring of a Priuy.</p>
               <p>Theſe and many other loathſome obſeruations
are vſed by the Iriſh, from the which they wil not
be diſwaded, but the vnnurtered ſort among them
are no leſſe admiring our decencie, then wee their
rudeneſſe &amp; vnciuility. And as I haue ſaid elſwher,
they wil not take any preſidents from the Engliſh,
and long it was before they coulde bee brought to
imitate our Engliſh manner, in diuers pointes of
husbandry, but eſpecially in the ploughing of their
land; in the performing whereof, they vſed the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of fiue ſeuerall perſons to euery plough, and
their Teem of Cattle, which commonly conſiſted
of fiue or ſixe horſes, were placed all in front, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
neither cordes, chaines, nor lines, wherby to
draw, but euery horſe by his owne taile; and this
was the manner of ploughing when I knew <hi>Ireland</hi>
firſt, and is vſed ſtill at this day in manie places of

               <p>Demand of them, whie they ſhould be ſo much

they ſhould not conforme themſelues to thoſe ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill

               <p>Cuſtome is a Metall amongſt them, that ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
which way ſoeuer it bee bent; Checke them

reprehend them for their Idolatry, they ſay thus
did our Fathers before vs: and I thinke it bee Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
that draweth them ſo often into rebellion,
becauſe they would do as their fathers haue done
before them.</p>
               <p>But alas! their iudgements are both blinde and

are falne into a blinde arrogancy, and they are ſo
generally bewitched with Popery, that they will
neither draw example nor precept from the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh.</p>
               <p>But I hope my generall ſpeeches, will breed no
generall offence; to ſay that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are generally
adicted to Poperie, it would argue but a quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
diſpoſition, to denay that truth which wee
ſee in daily example before our eies, and the Iriſh
themſelues (I am ſure) would be much offended,
if they were not able to drop ten Papiſts, for one
Proteſtant, throughout the whole Realme; them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
are neither aſhamed, nor affraid to confeſſe

loue the king, and without doubt there are ſome
ſmall number, to whome it hath pleaſed God to

his Maieſtie may well ſay with our Sauiour, <hi>This

               <p>The vulgar ſort of the Iriſh, wanting facultie to

               <head type="sub">Of the vulgar ſort of the Iriſh, what account they
make of an Oath.</head>
               <p>THe multitude of the Iriſh (I meane the ruder
ſort) are very regardleſſe of their Oathes, and
there are many reaſons to induce it; for I
haue knowne <hi>Ireland</hi> theſe forty yeares, yet (to my
remembrance) I neuer knewe any man punniſhed
for periury, by any Iudiciall courſe of the Princes
Lawes.</p>
               <p>They haue a cuſtome, that vpon any controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
amongſt themſelues in the Countrey, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
are inioyned to ſweare by their Land-lordes
hand; the which Oath, if the Land-lord do by any
meanes diſproue, he impoſeth a great fine vppon
the partie, and he ſhall be ſure to pay it: they are
therefore verie circumſpect in taking of that Oath.</p>
               <p>They haue ſome reſpect againe to their Oaths,
when they are depoſed vpon a Maſſe-booke: And
I will truſt him better, that offereth to ſweare by
bread and ſalt, then him that offereth to ſweare by
the <hi>Bible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I meane, amongeſt the greater number,
that make no conſcience what they ſwear vpon an
<hi>Engliſh book.</hi> And the ſimpler ſort of them, do hold
their Oathes to be ſo much the more, or ſo much
the leſſe, according to the bigneſſe of the book: for
if they ſweare vpon a little Booke, they think they
take but a little Oath.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:16398:24"/>
Thus, what betweene thoſe that are ſimply ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
and the other againe that are blinded with
Poperie, there will hardly be found a Iurie that wil
find for his Maieſtie. And heere (with al reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce)
I muſt needes remember that euer renowned Qu.
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who would many times ſaie, That the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> were ſo allyed in kindred the one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and ſhe hauing neuer a Coſine in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
could neuer get her right. But woe be to him,
that hath his ſtate depending vpon the verdict of a
Iurie in <hi>Ireland,</hi> eſpeciallie if he be a <hi>Proteſtant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The honeſtie of him that ſhould giue teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
in any matter whatſoeuer, is to be reputed for
more or leſſe, according to the companie that hee
is knowne to frequent. I do not thinke it therfore
conuenient, that a Papiſt, that is trained vp in the
deuilliſh doctrine of <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> and that they
may ſweare what they liſt, with <hi>A mentall reſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
is to be receiued as a witneſſe againſt a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
or to bee beleeued or credited in any thinge
that he ſhall either ſay or ſweare againſt him.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the two Midwiues, <hi>Shiphuah</hi> and <hi>Puah</hi>
in the firſt of <hi>Exodus,</hi> tolde a lie to the King, who
had commaunded that all the male children of the
<hi>Hebrewes</hi> ſhould be ſlaine, therefore ſaith our holy
Father the Pope, it is lawfull to lie for aduantage.
Methinkes his holineſſe might haue borrowed
ſuch another from the 12. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where by the
commandement of God, the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
Iewels of Siluer and Gold of the <hi>Egyptians;</hi>
if the Popes catholiques might haue the like liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with Proteſtants, then it were an excellent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:16398:24"/>
to be a Papiſt, for then a man might both lie &amp;
ſteale by authority, and they are not farre from the
matter: for it is knowne well enough, that in the
time of our late gracious Queene, the Pope gaue
full power and authority to diſpence with all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh
Recuſants, neither to holde worde, promiſe,
contract, nor proteſtation, what or howſoeuer,
that had bin formerly conditioned, or were heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
to be made with any Heretique (as they call
him) that will not acknowledge the Pope to bee
Chriſts high Vicar heer on earth, and that he hath
thereby full authority to depoſe Kings and princes
at his owne will and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Methinkes this Doctrine of <hi>Equiuocation</hi> and
<hi>Mental reſeruation,</hi> was very acceptable to the yong
married wife, who in her Husbands abſence being
ſolicited by an amorous friend, ſhe conſented vnto
him, vpon condition, that hee ſhould not meddle
with her lippes, neither to kiſſe, nor ſo much as to
touch them; Hir louer demanded the reaſon, ſhe
anſwered; That at my mariage day, this mouth of
mine made inuiolable promiſe to my husbande of
continencie; and therefore, what my mouth hath
Religiouſly vowed, ſhall Ceremoniouſly be kept:
content thy ſelfe therefore with the other parts of
my bodie, for my lippes are onely vowed vnto my
Husband, and for him I will reſerue them. I think
of my conſcience, this Woman was as firme in the
promiſe ſhe made to her husband, as a number of
Papiſts in their Oaths they do make to the king.</p>
               <p>This Doctrine is not onely warrantable againſt
Proteſtants, but it may ſometimes ſerue to ſalue a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16398:25"/>
vow that is raſhly made to God himſelfe, as the
holie <hi>Pilgrim,</hi> that made ſolemne proteſtation to
offer the one halfe of his good fortunes at the high
Altar, whatſoeuer ſhould betide him in his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
And by the way as he paſſed, fortuning to find
a bag of Nuts, hee eate vp the Kernels, and offered
vp the ſhels.</p>
               <p>What call you this, <hi>Equiuocation,</hi> or <hi>Mentall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation?</hi>
But call it what you liſt, this Doctrine

               <p>I could wiſh that the Iriſh would ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to the obedience of our <hi>Engliſh Lawes,</hi> for I
ſay the Countrey is accurſed, that is not gouerned
by <hi>Law,</hi> but it is ignorance that breedeth contempt

and <hi>Rebellion</hi> is the vtter decay, ruine, and deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>It is ignorance ioyned with obſtinacie, that hath

not onely contemned the poſitiue lawes of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but they haue likewiſe diſpiſed and
impugned the deuine lawes of the liuing God. And
where God is not knowne, the Prince cannot bee
obeyed: for it is the light and knowledge of Gods
word, that conteineth ſubiects in obedience vnto
their Princes; and where the Goſpell is generallie
receiued, there is peace and tranquillity vniuerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
embraced.</p>
               <p>It is not ſo in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and they are in nothing
more repugnant then againſt the law of God. And
as for the imitation of <hi>Language</hi> (as M. <hi>Stanihurſt</hi>
hath ſaid) it hath been thought very expedient, for
diuers reſpects, that the conquered ſhould ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
themſelues to the language of the Conqueror:
and for this very cauſe, when <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>
had conquered <hi>England,</hi> hoping to tranſlate
our Engliſh language into <hi>French,</hi> he cauſed al our
Engliſh Lawes to be written and ſet downe in the
<hi>French</hi> tongue, and ſo they haue continued, and are
ſtill remaining at this very houre.</p>
               <p>But heer beehold the godly diſpoſition of our
gracious King that now raigneth, who comiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the calamity of the hunger-ſtarued Realm of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> that hath neuer yet taſted of any thing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
in their owne language, but lies, fables, and

of that heauenly foode, whereof they haue neuer
yet felt ſmack or ſauour; he hath cauſed the New
Teſtament, togither with the Booke of Common
Praier, in that forme and manner as it is now vſed
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:16398:26"/>
in our Engliſh churches, to be both tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> and to be printed in the Iriſh Charracter,
that aſwell the lettered ſort, that can reade their

the benefit of his Maieſties clemency and loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, that doth ſeeke by curteſie to winne
them, that might otherwiſe enforce them by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
of Lawes.</p>
               <p>Now, for the Iriſh to invre themſelues to ſpeake
Engliſh, I thinke it were happy for <hi>England &amp; Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
both. If neuer a Papiſt throughout that whol
cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, could either ſpeak, or ſo much as vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
a word of <hi>Engliſh:</hi> and it is holden for a <hi>Maxime</hi> in

then one <hi>Iriſh</hi> will be found to turne <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, for the imitation of habit and attire, that
(M. <hi>Stamhurſt</hi> ſaith) ſhould likewiſe follow a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
I proteſt I would not wiſh the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſo much
harme, to inioyne them to follow our Engliſh fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
in apparrell, when there is almoſt neuer a
paſſage from <hi>Cheſter</hi> to <hi>Dublyne,</hi> but one Foole or
other commeth ouer with a new faſhion, either
for men or Women, or for both. And although
the Iriſh are proud enough of minde, yet they are
not lightly proude in their apparrell; and yet the
example of our Engliſh pride, hath doone a great
deale of harme amongſt that people.</p>
               <p>I remember many yeares ago (when I was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Bookiſh) I haue read of a pretty <hi>Prouiſo,</hi> deuiſed
for the preuention of Pride, an Act eſtabliſhed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring
all ſorts of people, aſwell men as women,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:16398:26"/>
from the wearing of any gayiſh or light-coloured
apparrell (<hi>Players</hi> and <hi>Curtizans</hi> onely excepted)
to whome free liberty was giuen to weare vvhat
they themſelues liſted.</p>
               <p>This did not onely incite thoſe that were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,
to liue within the compaſſe of modeſt and
comly attire, but it was alike inducement to thoſe
that were well knowne Strumpets, to ſhelter
themſelues vnder the habit of modeſty, thereby to
eſcape from being reputed infamous.</p>
               <p>But as the Prouerbe is, <hi>It is not the Frocke that
maketh the Friar,</hi> ſo without doubt, thoſe women
are not all diſhoneſt of their bodies, that by the
outward ſhowes in their Attyre, a man woulde
thinke, they had ſent their Conſciences vnto the
Stewes.</p>
               <p>It were pitty that beutie ſhould be Mercenary,
or that by ſtrange inuentions it ſhould ſet it ſelf to
ſale; And why are thoſe beauties vailed, that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
themſelues deſires to ſhew, and euery man
deſires to ſee? But they ſay it is for modeſty, and I
commend it, but let them bee modeſt likewiſe in
their Manners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pithagoras</hi> Neece was wont to ſay, that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
going to bedde with a man, ought together
with her Peticote, to put off all baſhfulneſſe, but
in the morning to put it on againe: Not like her,
that when ſhe firſt went to bed with a Sea-faring
man, ſtript her ſelfe quite of her modeſty, &amp; could
neuer finde a time to put it on againe after. But
modeſty (aſwell in attire, as in conuerſation and
manners) hath euer beene the reputed Ornament
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:16398:27"/>
of women; but to ſpeake truth of our Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of <hi>Ireland:</hi> that be of <hi>Iriſh</hi> birth, they haue lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
practiſe, either in pride or in good huſwiferie;
for they are for the moſt part alwaies buſied in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
their eaſe. And it is holden for a ſeruile kinde
of baſeneſſe amongſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> for a gentleman or
a gentlewoman, to be ſeen in any manner of facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
Idleneſſe onely excepted. And this conceipt
of theirs, is another occaſion of ignorance, which
as it engendreth many vaine &amp; laſciuious thoghts,
ſo it draweth after it, wicked and diſhoneſt deeds.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Chapter, I ſay, that thoſe of
the Iriſh that haue reduced themſelues to ciuility,
(were it not for their Religion) are otherwiſe, of
very good conuerſation; and aſwell in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
as in the decencie of their apparell, they are
very modeſt and comly, but they are ſo charmed
by their ghoſtly fathers, that if an Angell ſhoulde

ſhould be condemned amongſt them, yea and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

Porke, Hens, Rabits, and all together ſerued in a
great woodden platter: <hi>Aqua vite</hi> they muſt haue
good ſtore, or elſe it is not worthy to bee called a
feaſt. Vpon Wedneſdayes, Fridayes, and Satter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies,
they haue like plentie of fiſh, for vpon thoſe
daies, to eate a bit of fleſh, is a more deadly ſinne,
then either drunkenneſſe or Letchery.</p>
               <p>And commonly the <hi>Iriſh</hi> cuſtome is, that when
they are ſerued with fleſh, they haue no bread with
their meat, but if their ſtore be ſuch that they hauebread,
their fineſt Manchets are ordinarily Oaten-Cakes,
in this ſort prepared.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the remote places of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the ſtead
of Threaſhing their Oats, they vſe to burne them
out of the ſtraw, and then winnowing them in the
wind, from their burnt aſhes, they make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
meale, but if I ſhould ſay how vnhandſomely
they doe grinde them, or if I ſhould tel, how my
ſelfe haue ſeene a woman ſitting with a Muſtarde
Quearne betweene her bare thighes, grinding of
Oatmeale, I thinke a man would haue little liſt to
eate of the bread; but of this Meale, as ill in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
(to looke vppon) as a little durt vnder a
mans feet, they make their Cakes, for other bread
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16398:29"/>
they haue none, and it is but ſeldome when they
haue this.</p>
               <p>I might tell ſome other vnmannerly tales vſed
by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> in thoſe times of <hi>Coſhering,</hi> but I will
let them paſſe. And as M. <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> ſaith, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie
of this manner of feaſting, is ſet foorth by
<hi>Virgil,</hi> when <hi>Dido</hi> entertained the <hi>Troyan</hi> Prince &amp;
his company; but <hi>Maiſter Stanihurſt</hi> ſhall neuer
make me beleeue, that the Iriſh maner of <hi>Coſhering</hi>
was drawne from that preſident: but the manner
of our <hi>Iriſh</hi> writers, haue euer beene, to draw pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents
from ancient and Worme-eaten Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
for with theſe Trifles they doe bewitch the
poore ignorant people of the Country, that they
make them beleeue what themſelues liſt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade;
and the Iriſh are wonderfully addicted to
giue credit and beleefe, not onely to the fabulous
fixions of their lying <hi>Poets,</hi> but alſo to the Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticating
Soothſayers and Witches, like our
Husbandmen of the Countrey, that doe draw all
their knowledge from the Counſell of a Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And if any of their wiſe men, or wiſe women
(as they call them) do prognoſticate either good
or euill fortune, they doe more relie in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſagements,
then they do in the foure Euangeliſts:
and ſooner they will beleeue them.</p>
               <p>They doe beleeue in <hi>Charmes</hi> and <hi>Incantations:</hi>
then they haue words and <hi>Spels</hi> to driue away rats,
&amp; to heal diſeaſes: then they haue inchanted <hi>Gyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles,</hi>
that can defend the violence of ſhot, and are
of ſuch defence, that no ſword, or any other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
ſhall hurt the party that is girded with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:16398:30"/>
It were both admirable and incredible for to ſet
downe the obſeruations vſed by the Iriſh, vppon
certaine Saints Eeues, but eſpecially on <hi>May-Eeue,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Midſommer Eeue;</hi> what watching, what ratling,
what tinkling vpon pannes and candleſticks, what
ſtrewing of Hearbes, what clamors, and what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ceremonies are vſed, and not onely in the
Countrey, but in <hi>Dublyne</hi> it ſelfe, the very markes
and badges of infidelity, neither obſerued nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued
amongſt any other people in the Worlde,
but amongſt <hi>Infidels, Pagans,</hi> and <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is a wonder to ſee, how from theſe vain
fantaſies, ſo many famous impreſſions do ariſe, or
rather (I may ſay) how many infamous lies are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued,
and as when a man hath once gotten the
end of a <hi>Clue,</hi> hee may winde off at pleaſure what
himſelfe liſteth; ſo men that are naturally inclined
to nouriſh Nouelties, hauing once receiued any
thing for truth, he thinketh it a deede of charity to
impart it to his friend, and feareth not to adde
ſomething of his owne inuention, the better to
make the matter to be beleeued: and thus from a
particular errour, by this manner of handling, it
becommeth publicke: for as the flixability of our
inuentions, to frame reaſons vnto all manner of
dreames and fantaſies, are very apt and readie, ſo
our immaginations are likewiſe found as eaſie to
receiue impreſſions from falſhoode, deriued from
very friuolous and fooliſh apparitions: but it is
commonly ſaide, that to bee light of beleefe, and
eaſily perſwaded, proceedeth from a lightneſſe of
the wit, and weakeneſſe of the braine.</p>

               <p>MAiſter <hi>Stanihurſt,</hi> in his Chronicle of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
is very angry againſt Maiſt. <hi>Alan Cope,</hi>
that ſeemed to ſcoffe at the Iriſh conceite,
that will needs attribute the purging of venemous
Wormes from out of Ireland, to the Prayers of S.
<hi>Patruke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, although <hi>Maiſter Alan Cope,</hi> ſufficiently
proueth by the Teſtimony of ſeuerall writers, that
Ireland was deſtitute of all theſe venomous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,
many hundred yeares before Saint <hi>Patricke</hi>
was borne; yet Maiſter <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> is ſo angry, that
there ſhould bee any doubt or queſtion made of
that which hath beene ſo long receiued and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
for an vndoubted truth amongſt the Natiues
of Ireland, that he pickes a great many of quarrels
againſt M. <hi>Alan Cope;</hi> finding fault firſt, that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
obſerued <hi>Decorum perſona,</hi> nor <hi>Decorum dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi,</hi>
and then he quarrelleth with his <hi>Diuinity,</hi> which
(as hee ſaieth) is farre diſſonant from the Rules of
Charity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when he hath charged M.</hi> Cope <hi>with many
other abſurdities, he ſetteth downe this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
That like as God in his Iuſtice puniſheth a Country
that is hard hearted, with Wormes and Vermine, ſo of
his mercy they are remoued again from a Realme, that is
obedient and ready to follow his Lawes and Precepts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:16398:31"/>
                  <hi>To put this out of Queſtion, hee bringeth this
Preſident,</hi> That as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> woulde not liſten to thoſe
threats denounced him by <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Aaron,</hi> was ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
punniſhed with Frogges and Flyes, and ſuch other
vermine, yet vpon his ſhew of repentance, at the inſtant
requeſt of <hi>Moſes,</hi> thoſe plagues were appeaſed, and the
wormes extinguiſhed: why then (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) may it not
likewiſe hold, that Saint <hi>Patrick,</hi> finding the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſo
preſt and ready to embrace the Chriſtian faith, might
not ſtand ſo highly in the fauour of God, as through his
earneſt Prayers, the venemous and poiſoned Wormes
ſhould be abandoned.</p>
               <p>But alas (<hi>ſaith he</hi>) this is not a matter of ſuch diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to be belieued, when it was fore-promiſed by Chriſt
himſelfe, who in the xvi. of <hi>Marke</hi> ſaith, And theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
ſhall follow them that beleeue, they ſhall caſt out de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils
in my name, they ſhall ſpeake with new tongues, they
ſhall driue away Serpents, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Were not theſe places of Scripture well ſpyed
out by our <hi>Iriſh Chronicler,</hi> and as aptly applyed, as
thoſe of the Deuill, that willed Chriſt, if hee were
the ſonne of God, he ſhould caſt himſelf from the
Pynacle of the Temple, <hi>For it is written, That his
Angels ſhould hold him vp, that hee ſhould not daſh his
foote againſt a ſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I will not contend with M. <hi>Stanihnrſt,</hi> nor
with any other, whether it were Saint <hi>Patricke,</hi>
who by his Praiers hath thus purged Ireland from
Toads, from Snakes, from Adders, &amp; from other
like venomous Wormes: but there are other, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
Beaſts as Birds, as the Roe-Buck, the Moule,
the Pianet, the Nytingale, that are as meer ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:16398:31"/>
in Ireland, as the other, and I cannot thinke
but that it was one mans worke to expell all theſe
together, and all at one time. But if it were Saint
<hi>Patrick,</hi> or whoſoeuer otherwiſe, that was ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere
againſt the Nytingale, the ſweete Querriſter
of the Wood, whoſe delectable harmony is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to euery eare, I would he had been as ſtrict in
Iuſtice againſt that foul mouthed Bird the <hi>Cuckow,</hi>
whoſe notes were neuer yet pleaſing to any mans
eare, that was iealous of his wife.</p>
               <p>And yet to do the Iriſh no wrong, this gauling
griefe of iealouſie, is no generall ſickneſſe in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
it troubleth very few, and I account them ſo
much the wiſer; it is a kinde of frenzie, that neuer
yet did good, the wiſe men of the world hath euer
ſought to reſtraine it by diſcretion.</p>
               <p>If Hiſtories be to be credited, <hi>Lucullus, Caeſar,
Pompei, Anthoni, Cato,</hi> and diuers other gallant
men, were Cornuted: and although they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
knew it, yet they made no ſtirre about it,
that Coxcombe <hi>Lepidus</hi> onely excepted, who dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with verie greefe that his Wife had made him
Cuckold.</p>
               <p>But how many husbands haue their beene, that
haue indured this accident, not onely without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and offence againſt their wiues, but with
ſingular commendation to their owne Vertue, in
concealing it from the world.</p>
               <p>Some women there hath beene, that hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
themſelues, thereby to aduance her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
credit, ſometimes to ſaue her husbands life:
but this ſubiect is not for this place, and theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16398:32"/>
are out of ſeaſon for this age, but there
hath beene Husbands knowne, that haue of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
made Port-ſale of their wiues honeſties, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
for their profite, as for their preferment: as
<hi>Phanlius</hi> the <hi>Argian,</hi> who through ambition, offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his wife to King <hi>Phillip:</hi> And as <hi>Galba,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
a Supper of <hi>Merenas,</hi> and perceiuing him
to caſt ſome amorous glances on his wife, beeing
riſen from the Table, ſhrunke downe vppon his
Cuſhion, as one oppreſſed with ſleepe, thereby
to giue him the better ſcope, whereby hee might
perſiſt.</p>
               <p>It is a fooliſh curioſity for a man to ſeeke for
that which he would bee loath to finde, and that
when he hath found, he cannot amend.</p>
               <p>I rather commend me to him, who taking his
wife ſo tardy, that hee needed no other witneſſe,
then what himſelfe had ſeene, would not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
his own ſences, but would ſay, that he wold
neuer condemn a true dealing wife, for a falſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming
eye. I applaude his Wiſedome, that
with his owne Vertue, could ſuppreſſe his ovvne
ſhame.</p>
               <p>It is not ſaid without iudgment, that a good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
might be made betweene a deafe man, and a
blind woman. But I ſay, I woulde not wiſh that a
man ſhould either be too light in hearing, or too
quicke of ſight, to looke into his wiues affaires:
and for him that would liue in a quiet content, I
ſay that one eye were enough, and with the moſt,
for him that will be ſtill peeping and prying into
his wiues buſineſſe.</p>

               <p>IF a man may beleeue Maiſter <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> in his
diſcription of <hi>Ireland,</hi> there hath bin many holy
Saints, natiues of that Countrey, that were full
of Miracles, &amp; performed ſo many wonderful mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
as there is neuer a wiſe man in the worlde
would beleeue them to be true, and ſo they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
ſtill at this preſent houre. Our holy, holy
brood of <hi>Ieſuites, Seminaries, Fryers</hi> and ſuch other,
do performe ſtranges thinges, but ſpecially for the
increaſe and propagation of children, not a barren
woman in an houſe where they be lodged: for ſhe
that is not Child-bearing, a bleſſing from one
of theſe of the holy order will make her ſo to fruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify,
that her huſband (whatſoeuer he wanteth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides)
ſhal be ſure to want no Children.</p>
               <p>But as Maiſter <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> aduiſeth his reader not
to be ouer credulous to beleeue all that is written
of thoſe holy Saintes themſelues, nor yet of their
fained Miracles: ſo I proteſt, for the loue that I
beare to a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of my <hi>Ireland</hi> frends, I could wiſh
them to bee well aware of this holy brood of the
<hi>Popes</hi> Cockrels, the prouerbe is old, and not ſo old
as true: <hi>That Pigeons and Prieſtes do make foule houſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I haue heard of many Miracles, and there is no
place or Countrey where Popery is profeſt but
they are full of Miracles, full viſions, and full of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16398:33"/>
ſtrange euentes, but the Miracles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> they
are more fooliſh, more ridiculous, more groſſe, and
more abſurd then any other, that I haue either
heard or reade of. It were ſtrange to make relation
of the Miracles that haue bin wrought at the holy
Croſſe, but eſpecially at Saint <hi>Patricks</hi> Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and it is a peece of <hi>Rethoricke,</hi> ſometimes by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to affect ignorance, to ſet forth a ſubtilty; and
he that ſhould but reade, what Maiſter <hi>Stanihurſt</hi>
himſelfe hath ſet downe of that miraculous place
of S. <hi>Patrickes</hi> Purgatory if he hath bin but a little
touched with the Tincture of wit, will finde out
the very myſtery of groſſe and palpable Knauery.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Ireland</hi> is full of ſtrange Miracles, ſo I
thinke there are more Saints known in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
then euer was heard of in Heauen, or were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
regiſtred in the <hi>Popes Golden Legend.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee reade of a holy ſaint that was long ſithens
in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> called by the name of Saint
<hi>Wooddoge,</hi> to whom was giuen a large portion of
lands, the which were after tranſlated to the <hi>Byſhops</hi>
ſea of <hi>Rapo;</hi> but ſome of thoſe landes being houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
at this day from the <hi>Byſhop</hi> that now is, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
called in queſtion vpon what conſideration the
Church liuinges ſhould bee ſo detained, there is a
recorde brought foorth, how a holy <hi>Byſhop,</hi> many
hundred yeares ſithens, conueied away that parcell
of la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to one <hi>Sugere a Boylle,</hi> with theſe plain words,
<hi>For the vſe of his Daughters body.</hi> They haue more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
in the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> an old monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (cald
by the name of <hi>Baughall Murry</hi>) and this is reſerued
onely for <hi>O-Neale</hi> to ſweare by. There is mention
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:16398:33"/>
made of many other Saints; as Saint <hi>Colme,</hi> Saint
<hi>Branden,</hi> Saint <hi>Keuen,</hi> Saint <hi>Mac-Looge,</hi> Saint <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke,</hi>
and they ſay there are ſome few Saintes of a

is great hope that if <hi>Tyrone</hi> bee not already in the
<hi>Popes</hi> Kalender that he ſhall not be long out.</p>
               <p>I thinke this Saint <hi>Colme</hi> before ſpoken of, is
that great Saint in the North, called by the name
of <hi>Coleme Rille,</hi> in great veneration at this day for
many ſtrange Miracles, the which they ſay hee ſtill
performeth. Then they had a gentlewoman Saint,
that <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> in his Hiſtory maketh mention of,
called by the name of <hi>Bridgit,</hi> not that <hi>Bridgit</hi> who
in the time of <hi>Pope Vrbane</hi> errected a certaine order
of <hi>Nunnes,</hi> (called <hi>Bridgidians</hi>) but this without
doubt was a very holy woman, for ſhe lyes buried
with two men; namely with Saint <hi>Patrick,</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leme
Rille,</hi> as apeareth by an ancient Monument in
the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Doune</hi> in the North of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> where this inſcription is to be reade:
<q>
                     <l>Hi tres in Duno, tumulo tumulantur in vno,</l>
                     <l>Brigidia, Patricia, atque Columba pius.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I haue not numbred Saint <hi>Patrick</hi> amongſt theſe
Saintes that be of <hi>Iriſh</hi> birth: for if a man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
M. <hi>Stanihurſt,</hi> hee was a Welch-man borne.
He ſetteth downe in his Chronicle the certaine
place of his birth, and how comming ouer into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he bound himſelfe Prentiſe to a Maiſter, that
ſet him to keepe Hogs, and following his Maiſters
Swine in the fielde, one day as they were rooting,
one Hogge among the reſt, turned vppe with his
ſnowt a parcell of Gold, the which <hi>Patricke</hi> taking
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:16398:34"/>
vp, brought home his Hogges to his Maiſter, and
with that Gold, he bought his own Freedome: &amp;
thus departing againe into his owne Countrey, he
trauailed after that to <hi>Rome,</hi> wher being inſtructed
in the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> from thence he returnd again
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he eſtabliſhed the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
&amp; wrought a great many of Miracles more
then were true.</p>
               <p>Thus farre M. <hi>Stanihurſt,</hi> and till I had read it of
his owne ſetting downe, in his deſcription of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
I would haue layed two to one, that S. <hi>Patrick</hi>
had bin an <hi>Iriſhman</hi> borne. But I will be better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed
hereafter, both how I lay any wagers, &amp; how
I beleeue any ſuch authorities. But let S. <hi>Patricke</hi>
be what countriman he liſt, I wonder how he fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſo confirmable as M. <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> reporteth,
that will beleeue nothing now, but what their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
haue beleeued before them.</p>
               <p>They are now ſo much inclined to cuſtom, that
they will giue no place to reaſon, but let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtand
vpon Cuſtome as much as they liſt, yet truth is
truth, in deſpite of Cuſtomes hart: but preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is our naturall and originall infirmity, and this
opinion of wiſdome is the plague of man.</p>
               <p>I think the ouer good conceit and ſelf-weening
opinion that man hath of himſelfe, is the mother
of falſe opinions, both publike &amp; perticular, when
there is nothing whereunto men are more addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
then to giue way to their owne opinions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It was a bold ſpeach deliuered by</hi> Pliny: This on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is ſure, that nothing is ſure, and nothing more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and yet more arrogant and obſtinat then man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:16398:34"/>
Obſtinacie, is no other thing, then a ſetled and
firme purpoſe and determination, either to do, or
not to do ſomething: he that is in this manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,
is vnfit to receiue either councell or aduiſe,
how wiſe, how learned, how behouefull, or how
honeſt ſoeuer. And ſuch men, preferring their own
opinions, are the cauſe of many euils, &amp; do manie
times bring themſelues and others into extreame
dangers: and it is but loſt labour to diſſwade any
ſuch perſons by the rules of reaſon, for they preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to know more then all the world beſides, do
ſtop their eares to all good councels, and their eies
to all daungers, and perſiſting in their obſtinacie,
without reaſon or iudgement, the <hi>Browniſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
are not more preciſe, nor ſir <hi>Patricke,</hi> (Saint
<hi>Patrick</hi> I meane) the canonized ſaint of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was
neuer more holy, then theſe obſtinate fooles doe
aſſume vnto themſelues in their owne conceits.</p>
               <p>Curteſies that are beſtowed vpon obſtinat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
are euermore beſtowed in vaine, for there is
no curteſie nor clemency that can be ſo vſed, but
the nature of obſtinacie, is rather to impugn, then
to make any ſhew of humilitie.</p>

about certaine Wels.</head>
               <p>THere are yet other admirable matters in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
ſuch as I am halfe aſhamed to ſpeake of,
and yet if there were but one halfe of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

auow, wee needed no other phyſicke nor
Surgerie to heale all manner of diſeaſes. The blind
might be reſtored to their ſight, the halt and lame
to their limbs; there is no infirmity, but it might
be cured at ſundry ſanctified and holy wels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
there are great plenty in <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Citty of
<hi>Dublin</hi> is quartered out with them. Firſt, on the
Eaſt part, they haue Sai. <hi>Prtricks</hi> Well, the water
whereof, although it be generally reputed to bee
very hot, yet the very prime of the perfection, is
vpon the 17. of March, which is Sai. <hi>Patricks</hi> day,
and vpon this day, the water is more holy then it is
all the yeare after, or elſe the Inhabitants of <hi>Dublin</hi>
are more fooliſh vpon that day, then they be al the
yeare after. For vpon that day thither they wil run
by heapes, men, women, and children, and there,
firſt performing certain ſuperſtitious ceremonies,
they drinke of the water; and when they are retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to their owne homes, for nine daies after, they
will ſit and tell, what wonderfull thinges haue bin
wrought by the operation of the water of Sa. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks
Well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the weſt part of <hi>Dublin</hi> they haue Sa. <hi>Ieames</hi>
his well, and his feaſt is celebrated the 25. of Iulie,
and vpon that day, a great Mart or faire is kept faſt
by the Well. The commoditie that is there to be
vented, is nothing elſe but <hi>Ale,</hi> no other merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
but only <hi>Ale:</hi> I thinke ſuch another Faire was
neuer heard of in any other place, where a man can
not buy ſo much as a penniworth of pins, but what
money hee hath to beſtow, hee muſt lay it out for
<hi>Ale,</hi> and yet it carries the name of S. <hi>Iames his faire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:16398:35"/>
The multitude of raſcall people that vſeth to
frequent this faire, are firſt accuſtomed to perform
certaine ceremonies at S. <hi>Iames</hi> his well, in caſting
the water, backward and forward, on the right ſide
and on the left, and ouer their heads; then drinking
a draught of the water, they go into the Faire, and
there inſtalling themſelues in ſom Brothel-booth,
they ſit and drinke drunke all the day after.</p>
               <p>On the South ſide of the towne, they haue Sa.
<hi>Sundaies wel:</hi> I cannot tell what countrey man Sa.
<hi>Sunday</hi> was himſelfe, but his wel is of pretious eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
amongſt the Iriſh (I meane) amongſt the
Popiſh ſort of the Iriſh, that doe flocke thither ſo
thicke vpon ſunday mornings, in the ſummer ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that I am ſure, that if ſaint <hi>Sunday</hi> were there
in perſon to read a Lecture out of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they had rather go altogither to an alehovſe
then they would trauell ſo farre to ſee him.</p>
               <p>To the North-wards from the Citty of <hi>Dublin,</hi>
they haue S. <hi>Dolocks</hi> well; another ſanctified place
ceremoniouſly frequented at certaine ſeaſons, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
and ridiculous to be ſpoken of; ſo that let the
wind blow which way it liſt, Eaſt, Weſt, North,
or South, <hi>Dublin</hi> is ſo ſeated, that a Papiſt may go
from the high croſſe, with a <hi>Blowne Sheat</hi> right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the wind, either to an Idalatrous <hi>Maſſe</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the towne, or to a Superſtitious Well, without
the Towne.</p>
               <p>But this is moſt of all to be admired, that a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that hath bin ſo many yeares inſtructed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in the doctrine of the Goſpell, ſhould ſtill
ſubmit themſelues to ſuch groſe &amp; peruerſe foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:16398:36"/>
I might ſpeak of diuers other Wels, for I think
there is neyther <hi>Apoſtle</hi> nor <hi>Patriarch,</hi> that neuer
came neere vnto Ireland, and yet there be Welles,
Fountaines, and other holy places, that be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto them. But if I ſhould ſpeake of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and myracles, which they ſay are wrought
there, it would make a more admirable hiſtory the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that of ſir <hi>Iohn Mandevile:</hi> It woulde vndoo all the
Phyſitians in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> For at thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Wels, and at many other of thoſe ſanctified pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the blinde are made to ſee, the Lame are made
to goe, the Cripple is reſtored to his limbes, or
what diſeaſe ſoeuer, neuer ſo ſtrange, neuer ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueterate,
which is not there cured.</p>
               <p>But I am ſory for <hi>Dublyn,</hi> the place where I my
ſelfe do liue, the towne that of all others in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
I do beſt loue, I do not therefore ſpeake any thing
maliciouſly (I appeale to their owne knowledges)
whether I ſpeake true or falſe: I haue often ſaid, &amp;
ſtill do ſay, that there be many good people in <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin,</hi>
and ſo throughout all the parts of Ireland be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
men of all ſorts, of all profeſſions, and of all
degrees, that are not to be detected. And thus (I
hope) the good will take no exceptions at anye
thing that I ſhall truly report of thoſe that be ill.</p>
               <p>And although I direct my ſpeech ſtil to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
I make no ſuch difference between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> but that I know there bee as peruerſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
that come daily creeping out of Eng. to plant
themſelues in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that giue worſe example, &amp;
are more daungerous to his Maieſties eſtate, than
thoſe that are naturally borne in Ireland.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:16398:36"/>
I dare be bould to avowe it, that there is neuer
a Pulpit within the City of London (that at <hi>Paules
Croſſe</hi> onely excepted) that is better ſupplied, then
that Pulpit at <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> in <hi>Dubline;</hi> and how
many graue and learned men, that vpon a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Comiſeration haue charitably admoniſhed
them to deſiſt, from thoſe blind fantaſticall follies
which they themſelues by many years experience,
haue found to proceed but from their owne vaine
and ſuperſtitious conceites: but neither preaching
nor teaching can ſo preuaile amongſt them, but
that they become thereby to be more froward and
ſtubborne, and do with the more obſtinacy perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere,
not ſo much of ignorance, but rather in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite.
But I am come now to a ſtrange euent, a tale
of Maiſter <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> his owne ſetting down in his
Hiſtory of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and it is worth the reporting,
if it be but laught at, and thus it followeth:</p>
               <p>There is in the Notth part of <hi>Ireland</hi> a mighty
<hi>Loughe,</hi> 30. Miles in length, and 15. in breadth,
called by the name of <hi>Lough-Earne,</hi> but now called
<hi>Lough Sidny,</hi> I know the place well.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Lough</hi> (as Maiſter <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> ſaith) was at
the firſt one of theſe holy Wels, and was frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and ſought vnto, by the inhabitantes of thoſe
partes, for many Miraculous accidentes that was
there effected.</p>
               <p>A preſcribed cuſtome there was, (belike ſet
downe by ſome angrie Saint) that the <hi>Pilgrimes</hi> at
their departure ſhould not leaue the Wel vncoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
fore warning them aforehand, that when the
ſpring ſhould bee left open, the water ſhould ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:16398:37"/>
that it ſhould drowne all the Countrey ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying
neare about. And it happened (as Maiſter
<hi>Stanihurſt</hi> ſayeth) that an old Trot came to ſanctifie
hir ſelfe at that Well, and hauing vncouered the
ſpringe, a child of hers which ſhe had left but faſt
by, began to cry, the which the woman hearing,
forgetting the obſeruance of her preſcribed order,
which was to couer the Wel, ſhe made haſt to ſtill
her brat, and returning backe againe to haue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
hir miſſe, ſhee was incountered with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which was ſo farre ouerflowne, that it was
paſt her help, whereby both ſhe, her child, and all
the reſt of the inhabitantes with in that territorie,
were al together drowned. And here Maiſter <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihurſt,</hi>
fearing that his lye is to palpable and apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
yet to the end it might be ſomething the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
beleeued, he addeth, that there is the more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
of truth in this ſtory, becauſe the Fiſhers in
a ſunny day, may ſee the Steeples and other Piles
plainly, &amp; diſtinctly in the water. And this is a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
lye and more ridiculous then the firſt, for to
begin withall, it is well enough knowne, that the
<hi>Lough</hi> is of no ſuch deapth as M. <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> would
perſwade: large it is, and very ful of <hi>Iſlands,</hi> &amp; ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
deeper in one place then in another, but not
ſo deepe to drowne Steeples. Againe, Maiſter <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihurſt</hi>
hath very fondly forgot a <hi>Schoole Principle,
Oportet mendacem eſſe memorem:</hi> for Maiſter <hi>Stani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt</hi>
being an <hi>Iriſh-man</hi> borne, could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
(I am ſure) that in all that part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
neere about <hi>Lough-Earne,</hi> there was neuer yet
any Steeples knowne, vnleſſe it bee the Steeple of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:16398:37"/>
                  <hi>Armagh,</hi> there is neuer another ſteeple nowe to
that Lough, not by a great many of miles, perhaps
(as M. <hi>Stanthnrſt</hi> ſaith) there may bee ſome lately
builded in the bottome of the <hi>Lough,</hi> but I am ſure
that there neither is, nor neuer was any vpon the
land, in all that part of the Countrey.</p>
               <p>I do not meddle with this matter of any ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
whereby to impugne M. <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> in his hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie
of Ireland; although he hath therein fabled
forth a great number of vntruths: but I haue done
it indeed, whereby to make manifeſt the light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
of obſtinate Papiſtes, that are ready to giue
credit to ydle lies and fantaſies, then they are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue

               <head type="sub">A true deſcription both of the Citty and Cittizens of

               <p>HE that had no other knowledge of the Citty
of <hi>Dublin,</hi> but as it is deſcribed by M. <hi>Stani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurſt,</hi>
in his Chronicle of <hi>Ireland,</hi> woulde
thinke it to be far exceeding in ſtatelineſſe of buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and in many other commodities more then
it is at this houre, &amp; yet I am ſure that within theſe
forty yeares that I haue knowne <hi>Dublin,</hi> it hath bin
repleniſhed with a thouſand chimnies, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with as many glaſſe-windowes, and yet it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
no ſuch ſumptuous ſhew: But (ſaith M. <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihurſt)
It dooth exceed in gorgeous buildings, in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Chiualrie, in obedience and loyaltie, in largeneſſe of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16398:38"/>
hoſpitalitie, and in manners and ciuility.</hi> Firſt, for the
gorgeous buildings in <hi>Dublin,</hi> there be ſom other
Townes in Ireland that do farre exceed it: And to
ſpeake truly, the buildings of <hi>Dublin,</hi> are neither
outwardly faire, nor inwardly handſome: a ruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
kind of building, neither conuenient nor wel
caſt: neither do I thinke, that either the Maſons,
nor yet their Carpenters, are of skill to contriue
any better.</p>
               <p>For their <hi>Martial Chiualrie,</hi> I will not diſauowe
them, no doubt they haue able men among them,
both of body &amp; mind, but I beleeue there are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſouldiers in Ireland, then any be in <hi>Dublin.</hi> For
their obedience and loyalty, let mee not flatter
(if hee meanes it to the Prince) I ſay, that if they
would mixe but a little loue with that loyalty that
he ſpeakes of, the Popes <hi>vermin</hi> coulde not bee ſo
well entertained in <hi>Dublin</hi> as they be. It is but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to diſſemble any longer, for if we did but looke
a little into the courſe of experience, wee ſhoulde
find, that this mocking &amp; dallying with them, hath
done more hurt then good.</p>
               <p>For <hi>their largeneſſe of Hoſpitalitie,</hi> I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
them of their right: They are bountifull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of their meat and drinke, according to their
abilities. Now laſtly, for <hi>their manners and ciuility,</hi>
I confeſſe, <hi>Dublin</hi> is very well reformed, ſince M.
<hi>Stanihurſt</hi> writ his Chronicle. And now hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
againe to ſpeake of the pleaſantneſſe of the
ſcituation, &amp; by ſeeming, he would make it a town
impregnable. But I thinke M. <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> had little
skil in the Art of Fortification. Then he deſcribeth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16398:38"/>
it with ſo many Churches, with ſo many chapels,
with ſo many ſtreets, with ſo many lanes, with ſo
many Gates, and with ſo many Bridges, as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,
I hauing knowne <hi>Dublin</hi> theſe forty yeares, yet
know not where to finde the one halfe of them he
hath named; and a great many of thoſe that are to
be ſeen, when they are found, make but a ſory ſhew
in reſpect of the commendation he hath giuen.</p>
               <p>Maiſter <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> maketh mention of a certain
Tower ſcituat in <hi>Dubline,</hi> commonly called by the
name of <hi>Lſoudes</hi> Tower. Which as he ſaith, as it firſt
tooke the name from <hi>La Bell Lſoude,</hi> ſo it ſeemed
vnto him to be ſome Caſtle of pleaſure, for Kings
to recreate themſelues in.</p>
               <p>The pleaſantneſſe of the Tower is very well
knowne, in what caſe it was when M. <hi>Stanthurſt</hi>
writ his <hi>chronicle,</hi> fitter (in good faith) to haue made
a houſe of office, then for a Pallace to entertaine
Kinges, &amp; yet I cannot tell what manner of Kings
they had in <hi>Ireland</hi> in thoſe daies; but if they had
no better houſes then <hi>Lſoudes</hi> Tower to recreate
themſelues in, they were the ſillieth Kinges that
euer I heard on: but I wonder if Copper Ally
had floriſhed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Maiſter <hi>Stanihurſt</hi> writ his <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle,</hi>
as it doth at this day, what praiſes hee could
haue publiſhed in the worthyneſſe of that worke.</p>
               <p>To ſpeake the truth of <hi>Dubline</hi> as it deſerueth.
Firſt for the Town it ſelfe, it is conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enough,
pleaſantly ſeated, as wel for the ſerenity of the ayre
as for the pleaſing walks that are round about the
Citty.</p>
               <p>The Cittizens themſelues, are wonderfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16398:39"/>
in manners, in ciuility, in curteſy: them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
and their wiues modeſt and decent in their
apparell (I ſpeake of the better ſort) and they are
tractable enough to any thing, Religion only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted.
I had almoſt forgotten to ſpeake of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
but it is in Dublin as in all other places wher I
haue trauelled, an eaſie matter to play the Iugler,
to make a ſhew and appearance of honeſty, but to
keepe a due rule and a formable <hi>decorum</hi> in our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
thats the very point.</p>
               <p>The very names of goodneſſe and honeſty, are
many times the names of meere contempt, &amp; who
dares find fault at his honeſty, that is a knowne diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler
both with God and the world.</p>
               <p>God bleſſe me for ſpeaking againſt pride, letche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
drunkenneſſe, or againſt Idolatry. I will not
ſpeake againſt <hi>Dublin,</hi> but in many parts of Ireland
it is more dangerous to be reputed an honeſt man,
then to be a knowne knaue: greater perill to bee a
dutifull ſubiect to the King, then to be a profeſſed
<hi>votary</hi> to the Pope.</p>
               <p>Men are not to be deemed by their outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance:
for Infidels, and thoſe that haue no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
in Chriſt, will counterfait holineſſe: he is but
a fooliſh Painter, that cannot paint both white &amp;
blacke with one Penſill. I will neuer beleeue him
to be an honeſt man, that will firſt ſweare obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to his Prince, and then will ſubmit himſelf to
the ſeruice of his Pope; that will goe to Church
openly, and heare a Maſſe priuily; that will liſten a
little to the Preacher when he is in the pulpit, but
will neuer come neere a Communion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:16398:39"/>
God keepe me from being an honeſt man, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the deſcription that I ſee made of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
now adaies. And I ſay <hi>Heraclitus</hi> was but a fool
to paſſionate himſelf with comiſerating the follies
of his age; but I thinke <hi>Democritus</hi> would laugh till
he were ready to burſt, if hee were nowe liuing in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> to ſee the commixture of manners &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
how they are now carried.</p>
               <p>I will talke no more of ydle matters, but now a
little of Religion in Dublin: If there be one that
doth ſubmit himſelfe to his Maieſties procedings,
there is ten for one that is vowed to the Pope.</p>
               <p>Who knoweth not this to be true, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Dubline; the Papiſts themſelues do reioice in
it, and they not loue to diſſemble the matter, but
they will ſhew it both by wordes and deedes, that
they are ſo, and will be ſo accounted; and I thinke
they would be angry with him that ſhould other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
report it.</p>
               <p>Among many other priuiledges that they haue,
one amongſt the reſt is, that if there bee any Man
within the Citty (be he free, or be he forraigne) if
he doe ſeeme to finde fault at their entertaining of
Ieſuits and Popiſh prieſts, they may by their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
be at their choyſe whether they will loue him
or nay.</p>
               <p>If any man that is free-borne in the Citty, that
is conformable to his Maieſties proceedinges, and
doth ſhew himſelfe a dutifull ſubiect to his Prince,
it is at the Sheriffes choyce, whether he will bidde
him home to dinner or no.</p>
               <p>But Dublin is not yet ſo deſtitute, but that
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:16398:40"/>
there are ſome, aſwell learned Diuines, as other
graue and godly Cittizens and Townſ-men, that
God hath bleſſed with the light of his word, to ſpy
out all the Pageants of Popery, that do daily inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
themſelues to giue good example, ſeeking
no leſſe to aduance the glory of God, the honor of
their Prince, the good of their Countrey.</p>

many godly <hi>Preachers,</hi> and ſome other of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſort of the Cleargy, hath indeuoured a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
ſo farre as their Commiſſion doth war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
them, the which (indeede) is but by the way
of exhortation to admoniſh and perſwade: but
thoſe that haue authority to punniſh and correct,
and doth challenge to themſelues a ſpecial prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue,
to mannage all affaires whatſoeuer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
their Citty, are for the moſt part of them ſo
blinded with Popery, that they can neither ſee, nor
be perſwaded that this diſhonoring of the Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oth
day is any offence at all.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell from whence it ſhould proceede,
whither of ignorance or deſpight, that they ſhold
keepe ſo many Popiſh holy daies in <hi>Dubline</hi> (more
then euer were heard on in <hi>England</hi>) the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16398:41"/>
they are allowed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> are therefore
kept, as it were in contempt of his Maieſties pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
               <p>There be ſome that are numbred in the <hi>Beadrole</hi>
of Saints, and haue their Feaſts ſolemnly celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
amongſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> (eſpecially at <hi>Dubline</hi>) that of
my conſcience are damned Deuils in Hell.</p>
               <p>I know this will bee grieuouſly taken, and our
Papiſts will ſay my cenſure is very vncharitable, &amp;
more then becommeth a Chriſtian to auouch, but
blind men can iudge no colours. And if our <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of Dublin,</hi> could duely conceiue how horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a ſinne it is, for a Subiect to become a conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
a Rebell, or a Traytor to his Prince, they wold
ſooner pronounce <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> to bee a damned
villaine in the pit of Hell, then euery yeare to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate
his feaſt with ſuch ſolemnity as they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed.
I might ſpeake of ſome other ſuch like
holy ones, that bee inrouled in the Popes Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
And there is ſcarcely one weeke in a yeare,
but we haue one Popiſh holy-day or other ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
at <hi>Dubline,</hi> more then they haue at London,
and yet I thinke there be as wiſe men in <hi>London,</hi> as
any be in <hi>Dubline,</hi> and as true, and as loyall to their
Prince, but the <hi>vidimus</hi> of the matter is, our <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners</hi>
are neither vowed nor ſworne to the Pope.
Can there bee a more daungerous matter, then
where impiety becommeth to bee lawfull, and by
the Magiſtrates leaue and liking, to take the cloake
of vertue. I might ſpeake heare of <hi>Fryers, Ieſuites,</hi>
and other of the pole-ſhorne order, well knowne
to be his Maieſties vowed and proteſted enemies,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16398:41"/>
that are yet entertained, vpholden and maintained in
<hi>Dublin,</hi> not without great contributions allowed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, by the Papiſticall ſort of the Cittizens, that
will grudge and murmure to giue a Souldier a nights
lodging, that is drawne in by the Lord Deputy, but
for the guard of himſelfe, and of his Maieſties Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
and for the preuention of trayterous practiſes.</p>
               <p>This harbouring and vpholding of Traytors, muſt
neceſſarily either put his Maieſty to a charge for his
owne ſecurity, or leaue his eſtate in a deſperate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
euermore ſubiect to the plots and practiſes of
his capitall enemies. And I can ſee no reaſon why his
Maieſty ſhould be drawne to an expence, by the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors
of his falſe hearted Subiects, but that they
themſelues ſhould be made to feele the penalty of it,
if not in their perſons, yet in their purſes.</p>
               <p>But in <hi>Dubline,</hi> his Maieſty ſhould haue little
neede of Souldiers, or of any other martiall men to
put him to charges, were it not for the contemptuous
demeanor of the Popiſh ſort of the Cittizens: but if
vpon any vrgent occaſion, there bee but one hundred
of Souldiers to bee ceaſed amongſt them, the which
they themſelues by their obſtinate impugning his
Maieſties proceedings, doth many times inforce, they
will impoſe the charge (as much as in them lyeth) vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thoſe that they know to be beſt affected to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that do ſtand moſt aſſured to his maieſty, both
in duty and obedience; and would not onely drawe
contributions from Forrainers and Strangers, ſuch as
haue neither Trade nor Traffique in the Towne, but
would likewiſe inforce it from his Maieſties Pencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and other Gentlemen, that are there attendant
vpon the State, if they haue but a houſe or a chamber
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:16398:42"/>
within their Liberties.</p>
               <p>And they do not onely ſhew an vnwillingneſſe to
his Maieſtie in theſe trifling matters, but they do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
make manifeſt their ingratitude by many other
meanes. And whereas their Corporation hath been
dignified by ſeuerall <hi>Kings and Princes of England,</hi> with
many large priuiledges, and that they haue the whole
trade and traffique amongſt themſelues, no man to
buy or ſell within their liberties, vnleſſe he bee a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
yet vpon any impoſition, though it dooth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
belong vnto the Citty, and not ſo much but for
an annuall rent, which they are to pay to his Maieſty
for thoſe lands and liberties that they doe hold from
his Highnes, yet they would exact it from ſtrangers,
that are neither free, nor haue any manner dealing in
the Citty, but to ſpend their money, which only the
Cittizens doth gaine by; &amp; there is neither merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize,
nor any manner of commodity that is brought
from <hi>Spaine,</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> from <hi>Flanders,</hi> or from any
other part of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> but they will haue
the whole bargaine to themſelues, not ſuffering any
man that is not free, to buy for his owne prouiſion,
no, not ſo much as a drinking glaſſe, but it muſt bee
had from them, and by that meanes he ſhall be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to pay double the price.</p>
               <p>Thus the freemen, by vertue of their Priuiledges,
will reap the whole commodity among themſelues,
and they would make the Forraigners to pay theyr
rent, and to become contributors to any impoſitions
whatſoeuer it ſhall pleaſe them to aſſigne, and yet in
their demaundes, they haue neither certaine ſummes
ſet downe, what any man ought to pay, nor whoe
they be that ſhould pay, but the Sheriffes of Dublyn
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:16398:42"/>
are the men that do ceaſſe at their pleaſure whome
they liſt, and doth impoſe vpon euery man what they
liſt; ſo that if the Sheriffes of Dublin be a little ſtuft
in the head with a Pope (the diſeaſe being ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
amongſt them, that there are very few that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
eſcape it) where they ceaſſe a Papiſt at ſixe pence,
they will aske a Proteſtant tenne ſhillings, the which
if the party denaies to pay (or at the leaſt to ſatisfie
them to their owne content) they will breake open a
doore, contrary to Lawe and equitie (and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
farther then their Charter will reach vnto, if it
were well ouerlooked) they will carry away with
them any goodes whatſoeuer they be, that they can
finde.</p>
               <p>I could ſpeak of many other mattres, and I could
ſpeake by experience: for although I bee not a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Dublyn, yet I was thus much behoulding to
the two late Shcriffes, that becauſe I would not giue
them tenne ſhillinges which they had impoſed vpon
me, at their owne will and pleaſure, (I know not why
nor wherefore, vnleſſe it were for writing a Booke
againſt the Pope) but they verie kindly drew me out
of mine owne houſe and carried me to priſon, where
they kept me forth-comming for one night, &amp; this (I
hope) be very well knowne, by the ſame token, that
the verie next Sunday after, I coulde haue met with
one of them, in <hi>Hang-mannes</hi> Lane at an Idolatrous
Maſſe.</p>
               <p>But I cannot blame them, though they bee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
ſparing of their purſes vnto the Prince, for with
out doubt, they are at greater expences with the <hi>pope;</hi>
but if they coulde drawe in his Maieſties Pencioners,
and thoſe Gentlemen that are to attend his Highnes
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16398:43"/>
ſeruice, to bee contributers with them to thoſe pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
it pleaſed them to impoſe, I would more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
their wiſedomes, then I can do their honeſties.</p>
               <p>This deſcription of the gouernment of <hi>Dublin,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a generall reproach to the Cittizens vniuerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
for as I haue ſaide before, ſo I ſay ſtill, that <hi>Dubline</hi>
is repleniſhed with many worthy Townes-men of all
ſorts; and amongſt the <hi>Aldermen</hi> themſelues, there
are are ſome few that are well knowne to be aſſuredly
confirmed, both to God and to his Maieſty, and that
doth hate and deteſt this Ieſuited generation of the
Popes Riffe-Raffe: but they are ouerſwaied with the
multitude, the Papiſts do farre exceede them in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
and doe they not impugne the Prince himſelfe?
then alaſſe what can they doe, in a matter that could
yet neuer be redreſſed, neither by the preſcript of law,
nor by the intimation of loue.</p>
               <p>But were not this contemptuous diſobedience of
Subiects, enough to bereaue his Maieſtie of his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
diſpoſition: but I confeſſe, it is not good to put a
Prince into any iealouſie, or to bring him into any
doubt or ſuſpition of his Subiectes; for theſe are
meanes, not onely to trouble a Princes mind, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
many times to betake himſelfe to thoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
reſolutions as might be offenciue. But it is very
expedient for a Prince to haue due intelligence, aſwel
of his enemies as of his doubtfull friendes, in what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
they remaine, what determinations they hould,
and to haue knowledge of their enterpriſes, what
courſes they vndertake, and what purpoſes they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
but eſpecially thoſe Princes that are incertaine
and vnaſſured of the loue of their Cittizens and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</p>

all Officers, as well appertaining to the Army, as
to the foure Courtes, all their ſeruants, frendes and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
being there for the moſt part reſident; this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the Cittizens to raiſe their priſes in all thinges,
their Houſes, Chambers &amp; Lodginges, are dearer ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>Dubline,</hi> then they be in London.</p>
               <p>It is the nicitie of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (that are euery day inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating
&amp; deuiſing of new faſhions) that helpeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with their Sattins, their Silkes, their fine cloath,
both woollen and linnen, their new ſtriped ſtuffes,
their lace of Gold, of Siluer, of ſilke, and a number of
other gaudy deuiſes, that the Engliſh do vſe to buy at
vnreaſonable rates, that wold neuer be vented amongſt
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelues.</p>
               <p>The trade that they commonly vſe is but to London,
from thence they do furniſh themſelues with all ſortes
of wares for their ſhoppes, for ſhipping they haue none
belonging to the Towne that is worth the ſpeaking of,
yet they will bee called Merchantes; and hee that hath
but a Barrell of ſalt, and a barre or two of Iron in his
ſhop, is called a Merchant. He that doth but ſel earthen
Pottes and Pannes, ſope, Otmeale, Trenchers, and
ſuch other like traſh, is no leſſe then a Merchant: there
be ſhopkeepers in <hi>Dubline,</hi> that all the Wares they are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:16398:44"/>
able to ſhewe, are not worth a poore <hi>Engliſh Pedlers
Packe,</hi> and yet all theſe bee Merchantes. But now to
ſpeake the truth, there are ſeuerall Cittizens of <hi>Dubline,</hi>
that are very wealthy and men of good abillity, that
haue there Shoppes well repleniſhed withall ſortes of
wares, as wel Mercery, as Grocery, and Drapery, both
linnen and woollen, and there is neither Silk-man, nor
Milliner in London, that can ſhew better wares (for
the quantitie) then ſome of thoſe can do, that bee called
Merchantes of <hi>Dubline.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I am now to ſpeake of a certaine kinde of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
that outſtretcheth all that I haue hitherto ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of, and that is the ſelling of Ale in <hi>Dubline,</hi> a Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian
commodity, that hath vent in euery houſe
in the Towne, in euery day in weeke, at euery houre in
the day, and in euery minnute in the houre: There is no
Merchandiſe ſo vendible, it is the very marrow of the
common wealth in <hi>Dubline:</hi> the whole profit of the
Towne ſtandes vpon Ale-houſes, and ſelling of Ale,
but yet the Cittizens a little to dignifie the title, as they
vſe to call euery Pedler a Merchant, ſo they vſe to call
euery Ale-houſe, a <hi>Tauerne,</hi> whereof there are ſuch
plentie, that there are whole ſtreates of <hi>Tauernes,</hi> and
it is as rare a thing, to finde a houſe in <hi>Dubline</hi> without
a <hi>Tauerne,</hi> as to find a <hi>Tauerne</hi> without a Strumpet.</p>
               <p>This free Mart of <hi>Ale</hi>-ſelling in <hi>Dublyne,</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to none, but that it is lawfull for euery Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(be ſhe better or be ſhe worſe) either to brewe
or elſe to ſell Aale. The better ſort, as the Aldermens
Wiues, and the reſt that are of better abilitie, are
thoſe that do brew, and looke how many houſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
there are in <hi>Dublyne,</hi> ſo many Ale-brewers there
be in the Towne, for euery Houſhoulders Wife is a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16398:44"/>
Brewer. And (whatſoeuer ſhe be otherwiſe) or let hir
come from whence ſhee will, if her credit will ſerue
to borrowe a Pan, and to buy but a meaſure of mault
in the Market, ſhe ſets vppe Brewing: then they haue
a number of young ydle Huſwiues, that are both ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
loathſome, filthie and abhominable, both in life
and manners, and theſe they call <hi>Tauerne-keepers,</hi> the
moſt of them knowne harlots; theſe doe take in both
Ale and Beere by the Barrell from thoſe that do brue,
and they ſell it forth againe by the potte, after twoe
pence for a Wine quait. And this (as I take it) is a
principall cauſe for the tolleration of many enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
for the gaine that is gotten by it muſt needes be
great, when they buy mault in <hi>Dublyn,</hi> at haulfe the
price that it is ſold for at London, and they ſell their
drinke in Dublyn, at double the rate that they doe in
London: and this commoditie the Aldermens wiues
and the reſt of the Women-brewers do find ſo ſweet,
that maiſter Mayor and his brethren are the willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to winke at, and to tollerate with thoſe multitude
of Ale-houſes, that themſelues do euen knowe to be
the very Nurſeries of Drunkenneſſe, of all manner of
Idleneſſe, of whordome, and many other vile abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations.</p>
               <p>I haue hitherto ſpoken but of Ale-brewers, that
are almoſt as many in number as there bee dwellinge
houſes in the Towne. There be likewiſe ſome three
or foure that haue ſet vppe Brew-houſes for Beete,
whereof they are accuſtomed to make of two ſortes;
that is to ſay: Strong Beere, and Ordinarie: their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
Beere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they doe vſe to ſerue to the Engliſhe,
that are there inhabiting in Dublyn, that doeth keepe
Seruantes and Families, and this Beere they do prize
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:16398:45"/>
at ſixe ſhillings the Barrell, which according to their
meaſure, amounteth to xlviij. s. the tunne, and in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
their iiij. s. Beere, that is ſolde after the rate of
xxiiij. s. the tunne, is better Beere by oddes.</p>
               <p>Their ſtrong Beere is commonly vented by theſe
Ale-houſe Queanes, Tauerne-keapers, (as they call
them) and this they do take at xij. s. the <hi>Dubline</hi> Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,
and that is iuſt after the rate of xvj. s. a London
Barrell, which amounteth to iiij.l.xvj. s. the tunne,
ſhameful for the Mageſtrates of the Towne to ſuffer,
conſidering the cheapneſſe of Mault.</p>
               <p>Here is now to bee conſidered, that there is almoſt
neuer a Houſeholder in <hi>Dubline</hi> (whatſoeuer Trade
he otherwiſe vſeth) but hee will haue a blinde corner
in his houſe reſerued for a Tauerne, and this (if hee
haue not a Wife of his owne to keepe it) ſhall bee ſet
out to one of theſe Women-Tauerne-keepers, ſhee
taketh in drinke both Beere and Ale, after the rate of
xij. s. the <hi>Dubline</hi> Barrell, ſhe payeth moreouer to the
party of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe hireth her Tauerne, vj. s. out of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Barrell that ſhe vttereth: if ſhe doth not get vj. ſh.
more for her ſelfe, ſhe will neuer be able to keepe her
ſelfe honeſt, ſo that here is xxiiij. s. made out of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Barrell of Beere, which commeth iuſt to ix.li.xij. s.
a tunne. How ſhamefull a thing to be ſuffered in a wel
gouerned Citty, let wiſe men iudge, for with thoſe
that be called honeſt, I will not meddle.</p>
               <p>I haue beene ſo long amongſt theſe filthy Alehou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
that my head beginnes to grow idle, and it is no
wonder, for the very remembrance of that Hogges
waſh which they vſe to ſell for ij. d. the Wine quart,
is able to diſtemper any mans braines, and as it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
good nor wholeſome, ſo it is vnfit for any mans
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:16398:45"/>
drinking, but for common Drunkardes; but I wil here
leaue my women <hi>Tauerne-Keepers</hi> to Maiſter <hi>Maior</hi> of
the <hi>Bull-Ringe</hi> to looke vnto, and I will now haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
with our <hi>Dubline</hi> Bakers, that will be ſure to ſell
their Bread at double the price that they buy their
Corne: and although there haue been ſeuerall <hi>Maiors</hi>
of the Citty which haue ſeemed to be angry at the
matter, yet as long as I haue knowne <hi>Dubline,</hi> I neuer
knewe <hi>Maior,</hi> but hee was either aſhamed or afraid to
reforme it. But there be ſome that wil make ilfauored
reaſons, and will ſay, that the <hi>Bakers</hi> haue ſuch a kind
of dexterity, that they will make any <hi>Maior</hi> both deafe
and blind: I cannot tell how it commeth to paſſe, but
the Bakers do make a good ſhift for themſelues, for
they neither reforme their owne bread according to
the priſes of Corne, neither will they ſuffer the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-Bakers
vpon the Market dayes, to bring in bread
that is reformed to a true aſſiſe.</p>
               <p>Thus the Mageſtrates of <hi>Dubline</hi> doth tollerate
and beare with a number of inormities, vnfit to bee
tollerated in any well gouerned Citty, the which (as
I ſuppoſe) they do the rather wink at, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they know
well enough that this extortion that is exacted by ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Bread and Beere, doth pinch none but the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
thoſe that are to follow the State, &amp; thoſe againe
that are of the poorer ſort of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> for there is not a
Cittizen in <hi>Dubline</hi> (that is of any abillity worthy to
bee ſpoken of) but he hath a Farme in the Countrey,
that yeeldeth him Corne, both for Bread and Beere,
enough to find his owne houſe; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that
muſt goe to the Bakers and the Brwers, are made to
pay dearely for it (and ſo they do for euery other thing
that they buy) and as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> do know all this well
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:16398:46"/>
enough, ſo they haue therefore the leſſe care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſe
it: and yet if the Lord Deputy ſhould but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe
himſelfe but for two yeares together into any
other part of the Countrey, the greateſt part of the

place by a common conſent, that marke is vnfallible,
for there magnificence doth manifeſt &amp; make known
it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The office of a Prince doth craue obedience in his
Subiects, but our affections are ſtill depending of his
vertues: if thus to a Prince, what hope is there then
left to a Peſant, that hath neyther vertue, witte, nor
honeſty wherewith to bleſſe himſelfe withall, and wil
yet throng himſelfe into a Dignity, and onely but to
make it durty.</p>

                  <hi>Nero,</hi> demanding of a Souldior why he hated him,

               <p>
                  <hi>Ambition</hi> is no vice for any of theſe love-prized

The miſerable malefactor at the very houre of his
death, when he is going to execution, doth euen then
affect Fame, and is muche more deſirous that his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
on ſhoulde ſee him take his death with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and without feare, then hee is to reconcile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
vnto God, and is more aſhamed that it ſhould be
ſaid, that his countenance began to change with faint
neſſe of courage, then he is of the crime that he hath
committed, how abhominable ſoeuer. And all this,
but that he might appeare conſtant; and to whome,
but to thoſe that do behold him, that are commonlie
more inconſtant then the wind.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> More, whome <hi>Ballarmine</hi> (in his letter
to <hi>George Blackwal</hi> the Popes <hi>Archprieſt</hi>) ſo confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
avoweth for ſo worthy a Martyr, was ſicke of this
diſeaſe, and at the laſt houre, when he was to take his
death for Treaſon, he did ſacrifice to <hi>Fame;</hi> for when
the Executioner was ready to ſtrike off his head, hee
prayed him, in any wiſe to be good to his beard, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
him, that he ſhould find his necke ſo ſhort, that
if he were not very warie in the performaunce of his
buſineſſe, it might proue a blemiſh to his reputation.</p>
               <p>Methinks it to bee but an vnſeaſonable conceit, at
the laſt houre of a mans life to fall a ieſting with the
world for vaine oſtentation, and neglecting to ſeeke
the fruition of eternall felicitie, to reſt himſelfe vpon
the ſmoakie applauſe of Fame.</p>
               <p>It may ſometimes ſerue for a ſhroude to ſhelter a
ſhame, but it is an ill choſe time, to fall a ieſting with
the Hangman, when he may play too much vpon the
aduantage, if not by viuacitie or quickneſſe of wit, to
thruſt backe a ieſt vpon the Ieſter himſelfe, yet <hi>Ex of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio,</hi>
he may do it by action, that doth pinch nerer the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16398:47"/>
quicke, then the bittereſt words.</p>
               <p>But if More were a Martyr as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> woulde
haue him, I ſay he was but a mocking Martyr, that
would fall a ſcoffing with the executioner, at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
inſtant when he was to take off his head.</p>
               <p>But I haue heard of ſome others that haue been of
this merry diſpoſition, and I thinke aſwell worthy to
be Martyrs as More; one amongeſt the reſt that was
condemned to the Gallowes, and when the hangman
came to faſten the halter about his necke, hee deſired
him of all friendſhippe, that he would not bring the
rope too neere his throat: for (ſaid he) I am ſo tick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
about that place, that without doubt I ſhall hurt
my ſelfe with vnreaſoneble laughter.</p>
               <p>Such another, going to the place of Execution,
deſired the officer to ſhun a ſtreet that lay right in the
way as he ſhould paſſe, and to go a little about: The
Officer demanding the reaſon, hee told him, becauſe
he ought a Cittizen a little money that dwelt in the
ſame ſtreat, and he feared that if hee ſhoulde ſee him
paſſing by, he would arreſt him, and bring him vnto
ſome trouble of the law.</p>
               <p>I muſt not forget one more of theſe merry concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
fellowes, who going to the gallowes to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
was admoniſhed by his ghoſtly father to take his
death patiently, aſſuring him, that though his dinner
were ſomewhat ſharpe and harſh, yet he ſhould find
a ioyfull ſupper in Heauen. Alaſſe (ſaid the malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor)
thats but a cold comfort to mee, for I neuer vſe
to eate any ſupper.</p>
               <p>We cannot iudge of any mannes aſſurance by the
boldneſſe of his death: for it falleth out many times,
that men in thoſe caſes, wil make great ſhew of reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:16398:48"/>
and courage, but for oſtentations ſake, and
there is not a people that are more inclined vnto that
then the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> but amongſt thoſe that haue moſt vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
reſolued themſelues to execution, it is yet to be
doubted whither in ſo dangerous an intent, conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
or obſtinacy had the preheminence.</p>
               <p>Euery Cowarde can diſpiſe death in miſery, for to
the diſtreſſed, life is but a ſcourge, and death their only
ſolace: but hee that can indure the calamity of all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
with patience and conſtancy, more rather
deſerueth the Chariot of Triumph then <hi>Caeſar</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
Thoſe that in the times of execution are ſeene
to runne to their end and to haſten on the execution,
they do it with reſolution, but becauſe they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feate
themſelues of time to conſider of the horrour
of death, for it grieues them not to be dead, but to die.
<hi>Heliogabulus,</hi> the moſt diſolute man in the world, had
a reſolution to die ſome deſperate death, as it might
apeare by thoſe prouiſions he had made for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
for firſt, he built a ſtately Tower from whence
he might caſt himſelfe, hee alſo cauſed cordes to bee
made of gold and Crimſin ſilke, wherewith to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
himſelfe; he further prouided a rych golden Rapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of purpoſe to murther himſelfe; and hee prepared
poyſons, and kept them in boxes of <hi>Emeraldes,</hi> and
<hi>Topaſes</hi> thereby to poyſon himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Euery man that dares aduenture to deſire death,
cannot be ſaid to be reſolued to dye; for many a man
that hath ſeemed to wiſhe for death, hath fainted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
when they haue beene put to the tryall.</p>
               <p>Pouerty, miſery, diſeaſes, &amp; death it ſelfe are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
of a heauy burthen, that do waigh and grieue eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
thoſe mindes that are but of the common
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:16398:48"/>
ſtampe: we had neede therefore to be very wel inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
both how to ſuſtaine, and how to combat with
thoſe kindes of accidentes. The beſt aime we can take
whereby to iudge of a mans death, is but to conſider
of the manner of his life: for haue we knowne him to
liue conſtantly and quietly it is likely hee ſhould then
die reſolutly and repoſely, for it is to bee ſuppoſed,
that hee that konweth how to liue, knoweth likewiſe
how to dye.</p>
               <p>Amongſt all the benefites that Vertue beſtoweth
of vs, the contempt of death is moſt aproued and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious:
and as the place is vncertaine where death loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
for vs, we muſt therefore be the more vigilant to
expect him euery where, for the premeditation of
death, is but a fore-thinking how to liue and die well.
It skilles ſo much the leſſe when death doth come, ſo
we be prouided for it, for all the time that we liue, we
do but ſteale it from death, and the continuall worke
of life, is in the end determined by death.</p>
               <p>The iollity of youth and the grauity of age are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in this point, for the one looketh forward and
the other backward, youth delights it ſelfe with wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
allurements, Age preacheth ſeuerity, and readeth
daily Lectures of temperance and of reformation, and
whether it wake or ſleepe, it doth not permit vs one
houre but to thinke on inſtruction, on patience, on
repentance, and on Death.</p>

               <p>THey ſay it was S. <hi>Patrick</hi> that purged Ireland fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
all manner of venemous Wormes, and it is the
Pope that hath poiſned it ten times worſe with
his <hi>Locuſt vermine</hi> of Friers, Monks &amp; Ieſuites, &amp; he
hath ſo infected the whole Countrey with Toades,
Frogs, &amp; padocks, that in the habite of popiſh prieſts
do keepe ſuch a continuall croking in the eares of the
poore people, that they haue made them deafe to all
good councell. It is only the poiſon of the Popes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
that inciteth to ſeditions, to Rebellions, and
that ſetteth ſubiects againſt their Princes. Look into
<hi>Bellarmines</hi> writinges, that hath taken ſuch paines in
behaulfe of the Pope, and you ſhall finde, that all his
Bookes are ſtuffed with no other Doctrine, but that
Popes may degrad Emperors, kings, Princes and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates,
may abrogate their Lawes, may diſpenſe
with their ſubiects for their allegiance, that they may
take Armes againſt their Soueraignes, that they may
rebell; yea, and althogh Treaſon and murther be the
moſt hatefull offences that any man can commit, and
are moſt abhorred and deteſted of all men, yet they
are admitted, maintained, and vpholden by the pope,
and he doth not onely tollerate thoſe offences, but he
doth likewiſe giue pardons and diſpenſations to his
villaines, both to practiſe and execute them, as that
holy Pope, that gaue <hi>Parry plenarie</hi> indulgence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:16398:49"/>
of all his ſins to murther <hi>Queene Elizabeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A filthy Religion, that hath abaſed the ſimplicity
of all natures, and defiled the people of ſo many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
not onely through Idolatry, and ſuperſtition,
but alſo by bloud-ſhedding, and deteſtable murthers,
as though it were lawfull and no offence (if it be done
vnder the colour and ſhew of Religion) to abandon
all honeſty and ſhamefaſtneſſe: inſomuch, that ſuch
horryble and deteſtable crewelty hath been ſhowne,
that their <hi>Alters</hi> haue beene oftentimes inbrewed and
ſtained with mens bloud, as though God were plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with thoſe horrible murthers, practiſed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by thoſe abhominable wretches, that care not
how they defile themſelues with all kinde of beaſtli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and deteſtable villany.</p>
               <p>This is the Religion which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> do imbrace,
and this Doctrine is it that hath deluded a number of
poore people of that Countrey, and hath ſet them ſo
oppoſite, that they deſpiſe to learne any thing from
the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> bee it neuer ſo neceſſary, that doth but
appertain either to Ciuillity, Morallity, or Humanity:
it maketh ſome of them malitiouſly to impugne the
proceeding of the Prince, it hath induced a number
of them into open Rebellion. And this Idolatrous
Doctrine is it that fitteth their turnes, that are ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dected
and inclined to vndertake againſt the Prince.
The property of true Religion, doth euermore keepe
men within the bounds of duty, it illumineth them
with the true light of holineſſe, and ſanctimony; and
ſo deſirous are they which followe the rule and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of Chriſt, by immitation to expreſe the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
goodneſſe and mercy of God, that in the ſame
they repoſe the whole ſum of Religion: therefore
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:16398:50"/>
neither prouoked with taunts, they are any thing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and being vexed with ſlandrous reports, they are
not yet kindled with anger; and although they bee
ſometimes prouoked with iniuries, they do not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to bee reuenged: nay, rather they ſuppoſe that
triall to be laid vpon them, that they by a heape and
multitude of good turnes, ſhould abate the edge of
their enemies wrath.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the Popes doctrine had ouerwhelmed the
Realme of England, with the miſty fogs of darkneſſe,
what commotions, what rebellions, &amp; what tumults
were ſtirred vp from time to time, by the commons
of that Realme: but after that the minds of men were
able to behold the extraordinary light of the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
doctrine, they ſubmitted themſelues to that duty
and obedience, which the rule of Gods worde both
preſcribeth and commaundeth to ſubiectes: yet after
this, when Queen <hi>Marie</hi> had againe reeſtabliſhed the
Idolatrous Religion of <hi>Rome;</hi> when Hell was broken
looſe, and that the Deuils themſelues had ſtirred vp
the harts of our Engliſh Popelings to all cruell tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that they left no torture nor torment vnattemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that might haue wrought the ſubuerſion and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow

of men and women, ſuffered themſelues to be tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and cruelly tormented, through all the partes of
the Realme for the Faith of Chriſt, without any
manner of reſiſtance: and although this horrible cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
had continuance for fiue whole yeares together,
yet where was their heard of a Rebell that offered to
ariſe in armes, or by any meanes to oppoſe himſelfe
againſt that monſtrous tyranny.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Faith was firſt eſtabliſhed by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:16398:50"/>
and the Diſciples and thoſe that followed
Chriſt, preuailed ſtill by ſuffering: the Pope vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his doctrine, onely by perſecuting, by murther,
by Treaſon, and by tyrannie; ſuch diuerſity there is
betweene the doctrine of Chriſt, and the doctrine of
the Pope.</p>
               <p>It is truly reported of the <hi>French</hi> K. that was latelie
cruelly murthered, who many years ſince lying before
<hi>Rone,</hi> had intelligence of an enterpriſe that ſhould
haue beene attempted againſt his life, and being well
informed of the party that had vndertaken it, the king
chancing to deſcry this Gentleman thus deſcribed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, cauſed him to be called; who comming before
his preſence, the King perceiuing him alreadie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to tremble, as one doubting ſome bad meaſure,
ſaide vnto him: I am fully perſwaded, you fore-ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
what I haue to charge you with, and your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
doth already bewray it, but I am ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
in the buſineſſe you haue taken in hand, that
if you would goe about to hide it, you ſhoulde but
make the matter the worſe for your ſelfe; faile not
therefore as you tender your life, to confeſſe the truth
of all your purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Villaine, that ſawe himſelfe thus diſcouered,
beganne to hold vp his hands and to plead for mercy:
but the King interrupting him in his pretence, ſaide
vnto him; Did I euer do you any wrong? Haue I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
offended any friend of yours? or how happeneth
it? or what might mooue you to conſpire and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
my death?</p>
               <p>The Gentleman with a verie fainte trembling
voice, and a ſelfe-accuſing looke, aunſwered him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
That no particular occaſion had euer mooued
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:16398:51"/>
him to doe it, but the intereſt of the generall cauſe of
his faction, for that he was perſwaded by ſome of his
ghoſtly fathers, that to root out (and in what manner
of ſort ſoeuer) to make away ſo great an enemy vnto
their Religion, would be an execution full of pietie,
and a worke of ſupererogation.</p>
               <p>Well then (ſaid the King) I will ſhew you the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of our Religions: yours perſwades you to kill
me hauing neuer done you wrong, but mine wils me
to pardon you convicted as you are: go your wayes
therefore and auoid out of my ſight, and let mee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſee you here againe, and henceforward be better
aduiſed in your enterpriſes, and take honeſter counſel
then thoſe that be of your owne Religion, and thus
he let him paſſe.</p>
               <p>We may here ſtill ſee the fruits of the Popes Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
but preſidents in <hi>Ireland</hi> do ſerue to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
if they make againſt the Pope; all the teſtimony
that the holy ſcriptures can afford, will neuer be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited
in that point. We beleeue in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that when
Chriſt came to worke the ſaluation of the world, hee
did not finiſh the work he came for, but left the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
part of the buſineſſe to be performed by a Popiſh
Prieſt. We can tell how to worſhip a god that is of
our owne making, but we know not how to worſhip
the God that hath made vs: we know how to receiue
benefits and bleſſings from the Prince, but we know
not how to render that obedience that belongeth to
Subiects. My concluſion is, that as men cannot make
knowne their dreames till they bee awake, no more
can theſe acknowledge their faults till they meane to
amend.</p>

               <p>THey ſay, a manne ought not to be aſhamed to
ſpeake what he ſeemeth not to thinke; it ſhould
then follow, that men ſhould not be aſhamed to
heare of that they are not aſhamed to doe. The Iriſh
are not aſhamed to manifeſt themſelues, aſwell by
wordes as by deeds to be profeſſed Papiſtes; they are
not affraid to confeſſe it, and it may well be ſuppoſed
that when men haue a daring to ſpeake ill, they haue
likewiſe an intent to do ill. But I muſt ſay, they are al
his Maieſties ſubiects, and ſo I thinke they bee, but I
pray God ſend his Highneſſe to haue neede of them
againſt the Pope, for if it came to voices betweene
them two, his Maieſtie would hardly bee able to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
with the Vſurer, after ten in the hundred thrugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Realme, but that the Pope would ſtill
be able to encounter him with ten for one. That the
Iriſh are thus inclined to the Pope and to poperie, I
ſhal need no other teſtimony then their own demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
and I would bee glad for their owne ſakes, that
they could conuince mee of ſlaunder: but as I hope
they will not go about it, ſo I thinke they will not be
offended with me for ſpeaking, when they themſelus
are not aſhamed ſo publikely to manifeſt it. For, as
they do ſhew themſelues to be apparantly malicious
to his Maieſties lawes and proceedings, ſo they doe
hate and deteſt him, that doth but ſpeake againſt their
Pope, or that will take any exceptions againſt that
Catholick brood of the Pole-ſhorne order, that they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:16398:52"/>
do both harbour in their houſes, and vphold with
their purſes (without doubt) to their great charge &amp;
expences, conſidering the abhominable number of
thoſe <hi>Balamites,</hi> that doth ſo abound throughout that
whole Realme, in City, town &amp; Countrey, that doth
daily practiſe againſt his Maieſties gouernment.</p>
               <p>And what Prince in the world would indure to be
thus croſſed by this contemptious demeanor of vndu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
ſubiectes, and would not make them to feele the
penalty of their wilfull diſobedience, but that exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Maieſtie that is not onely inclined to all gracious
clemency in his owne perſon, but with the like royall
diſpoſition hee hath ſo prouided, that his Miniſters
and thoſe that he putteth in Authority in that Realm,
doth behaue themſelues in their gouerment with that
mercy &amp; mildnes whereunto he himſelfe is addicted.</p>
               <p>If I ſhoud ſpeake of the gouernment, how it is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
at this preſent, by that moſt honorable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the Lord Deputy that now is, who is likewiſe
aſſiſted with diuerſe other of his Maieſties Counſaile
of that Realme, Men in like maner of great wiſedome
and iudgement; I might perhaps faile in making a true
relation of their worth and worthines. I do therefore
appeale to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> themſelues, when they did euer
know <hi>Ireland</hi> to be better ſupplied, either with a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty,</hi>
either with a Counſell, either with a Clergy (I
meane thoſe of the Clergy that haue beene inueſted
by a lawfull Authority from the Prince) or that the
affaires of that Realme, were euery known to be man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
with more mildnes, with more mercy, or with
more loue and lenity then now they be: and I would
but demand of them againe, when they did euer know
the Papiſts of <hi>Ireland</hi> to bee more peruerſe, more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16398:52"/>
or more apparantly contemptuous then now
they are. I could yet ſay more, but I will wade no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in this, and I am ſure the papiſtes themſelues (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they will not let to lie for adantage, yet) they
they will not for ſhame deny this truth. The papiſtes
of Ireland are (as in other places) of two kinds, the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers,</hi>

that they can ſay they haue bin in <hi>Spain,</hi> or at <hi>Remes,</hi> or

can but ſay a Maſſe, or read our Ladies pſalter; any of
theſe ſhewes, any of theſe pretences, or any of theſe
tytles, are enough to grace and credit a <hi>Dog,</hi> and not
only to bring him into a venerable eſtimation, and to
be holily accounted of, but to giue him that reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
amongſt the multitude, that he ſhall be beleeued,
and he ſhall be beloued; for men are commonly bele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
as they are beloued.</p>
               <p>And theſe ſeducing ſpirits vnder a counterfet ſhew
of holineſſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are ſtill endeuoring to peruert the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pler
ſort of his Maieſties poore ſubiects, to withdraw
them from their duties, and to arme them with all
diſobedience and contemptuous demeanour towards
their Prince.</p>
               <p>The ſecond kind of Papiſts, that I haue ſaid to bee
ſeduced, are the vnlearned and ignorant ſort, that are
abuſed and miſled, by the onely inducements of thoſe
counterfait <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> thus formerly deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Now, if there be any comiſeration to bee had to a
people that are thus inchanted, theſe are to be pittied,
and it is for their ſakes onely that I haue endeuoured
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16398:53"/>
theſe lines, the which if I woulde goe about to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
by any authoritie drawne from the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
I know it would be to very litle purpoſe, when
there is no teſtimony that can be alledged, either fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <hi>Peter,</hi> or from <hi>Paule,</hi> or from any other of the <hi>Apoſt.</hi>
or from Chriſt himſelfe, that will be either admitted
or receiued againſt the Pope. Whatſoeuer I haue
therefore related in this Deſcription, that may any
waies concerne the Iriſh, I haue neither inferred pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents,
nor inforced other matter, but ſuch as they
themſelues are beſt acquainted withall, and what is
moſt frequent and conuerſant to their owue experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
And there is not a Nation vnder the ſun, that
are more apt to make collections of accidentes that
ſhall happen, or that will ſoner refer them to preſage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of misfortune, then will the Iriſh.</p>
               <p>And although our Papiſts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are generally
compacted of a dull mettall, that hath little ſence or
feeling but of ignorance &amp; arrogancy, yet thus quick
ſighted they be, to looke into thoſe euents that doth
make nothing at all for their purpoſe, and are ſtarcke
blind on the other ſide, to diſcerne of thoſe matters
that do eſpecially concerne themſelues.</p>
               <p>If they woulde but remember, what a number of
runnagate ſhakerels the Pope hath ſent from time to
time, laden with his traſh: with his <hi>Buls,</hi> with his <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons,</hi>
with his <hi>Bleſsings,</hi> and with his <hi>Ban-bels,</hi> which
they take to be a ſtrong <hi>Superſedias</hi> againſt all perils &amp;
dangers, what or whereſoeuer; and yet if there were
but halfe that ſanctitie in them that they ſuppoſe, they
could not all miſcarrie, ſome of them woulde take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
for they are aſſuredly perſwaded, that he that can
but furniſh himſelfe with a little holy-water, an holie
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:16398:53"/>
candle, an <hi>Agnus dei,</hi> a paire of hallowed beades, or
with ſome ſuch other of the Popes trinkets, he is free
from al misfortunes: &amp; yet they haue ſeen the popes
<hi>Holy-banner</hi> that was brought amongeſt them from
<hi>Rome</hi> by D. <hi>Saunders,</hi> that holy embaſſador, ſent from
the Pope, and they were perſwaded, that where this
banner was once diſplayed, the very ſight of it hadde
bin enough to haue diſmayed a whole army of deuils;
but this vaine hope of theirs coſt a number of Rebels
liues, and ſent a many of Traitors heads to <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They ſaw what becam of the Popes two holy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
<hi>Ailyn</hi> and <hi>Saunders,</hi> whom the Pope had ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and al-to be-bleſſed: and thus hallowed, hee ſent
them into Ireland, in aſſiſtance of them that wer then
out in Armes againſt their Prince, and they ſaw what
became of them; the one was ſlain in the field among
a number of other Rebels, and the other finiſhed a
traytorous life by a miſcrable death, and died in the
Woodes, and as it was ſuppoſed, was deuoured by
Wolues: but others ſay, he died in the Wood <hi>Clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedi,</hi>
partly thorough famme, and partly of the Iriſh
Ague.</p>
               <p>They haue ſeene how many confederates, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
conſpiracies, how many practiſes of Treaſon hath
bin plotted, hom many deteſtable exploits haue been
vndertaken, yet all of them diſcouered, and the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſers
ſtil confounded, our ſilly Papiſts of Ireland haue
not onely heard of theſe things with their eares, but
they themſelues haue likewiſe ſeen it with their eies.
But they profite nothing, neither by hearing, nor in
beholding: they can woonder at them, and they can
ſay with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> when they ſawe the Miracles
wrought by <hi>Moſes; The finger of God is here,</hi> but they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16398:54"/>
haue no grace to repent, it doth but harde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their harts,
it armeth them with deſpite both againſt God, and

               <head type="sub">The inconvenience of Poperie, how it hurteth in Ireland.</head>
               <p>MIght we now iudge of the tree what it is by the
fruit, or (as the Papiſts themſelues are accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
to deeme of all cauſes by their owne ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
Popery could not hide it ſelfe, but that it would
appeare in it owne likeneſſe, loathſome to euery eie.
But it is very eaſie for a man to winke at that, which
himſelfe is vnwilling to ſee; but if we would not bee
enemies to our own diſcretions, to diſcern of things
with iudgement and reaſon, though reaſon it ſelfe be
but a gadding inſtrument, and is many times miſled
by our owne affections, it could not yet lead vs ſo far
aſtray, but it would vndoubtedly confirme vs, that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie
is the onely plague-ſore, that hath ſo poyſoned
Ireland.</p>
               <p>It is Popery that hath drawn the people from that
confidence and truſt that they ſhould haue in God,
to beleeue in Saints, to worſhip Idols, and to fly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Gods mercy to other mens merits, and to ſet vppe a
Pope-holy righteouſneſſe of their owne works.</p>
               <p>It is Popery that hath alienated the heartes of that
people, from that faith, fidelity, obedience, loue and
loyaltie, that is required in Subiects towardes theyr
Soueraignes.</p>
               <p>It is Popery that hath ſet afoot ſo many rebellions
in Ireland, that hath coſt the liues of multitudes, that
hath ruyned that whole Realme, and made it ſubiect
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:16398:54"/>
to the oppreſſion of Theeus, Robbers, ſpoilers, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,
Rebels and Traitors.</p>
               <p>It is Popery, that hath ſtill hardened the hearts of
that people, as well againſt God as againſt all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>I haue knowne Ireland long, and I haue heard of
many odible exploites that hath beene accompliſhed,
by Murther, by Rebellion, by Treaſon, and by many
other villanies; but they haue beene euermore plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
conſpired, acted, and performed by Papiſtes: It is
the Papiſt that is ſtill the Authour, the vndertaker and
the Executioner of all manner of villanies, how bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous,
how cruell, or how odible ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>God be thanked, <hi>Ireland</hi> was yet neuer ſo deſtitute,
but there hath been a number of good people natiues
of that Countrey, that hath zealouſly and religiouſly
profeſſed the Goſpel, yet I neuer heard of any of thoſe
that was euer tainted, ſtained, or detected with any
of theſe capitall crimes: no, it belongeth to Popery,
it is a parcell of the Popes doctrine; for hee auoweth
it to be a worke meritorious, for any of his Diſciples
to lie, to flatter, to counterfeit, to diſcemble, or to
enter into any action, be it neuer ſo baſe, bee it neuer
ſo abiect, be it neuer ſo ſeruile, yet if they can by any
of theſe meanes compaſſe a plot of villanie, they may
doe it by preſcription, he giueth them Buls, he giueth
them Pardons, he giueth them Diſpenſations.</p>
               <p>From hence it is, that the poore Popelings of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
doe thinke there is no other high-way to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
but that which leadeth by theſe damnable inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours,
thus graced and countenanced by the Pope.
And they know againe well enough, that his holines
is in nothing beter pleaſed, then in thoſe that will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16398:55"/>
and exploite againſt the Prince. The better
therefore to countenance the matter, and to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
oportunity, they pretend great loue and loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
they will proteſt ſubiection, perhaps they will go
to Church and heare a Sermon, and what care they
for taking of an oath which they neuer mean to keep,
the Pope is able to forgiue all, and this is the vvay
to giue them credit, whereby they may practiſe what
they liſt, and how they liſt, they know it well enough:
But if I would goe about to infer preſidents, I might
be infinite in example, to ſhew what murthers, what
maſſacres, what treacheries, and what Treaſons haue
bin performed, which the <hi>Iriſh</hi> could neuer haue been
able to haue effected, but by that honeſt repoſe there
hath bin had of their fidelity, and by that countenance
and credit that hath bin giuen them by the Prince.</p>
               <p>It is by our truſt that they compaſſe their treaſon &amp;
it is our ſufferance that inableth them in all their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,
and what they performe by fraud, by falſhood,
by periury, by breach of faith and fidelity, is ſtill aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
vnto them, for wit, for pollicy, for valiance, and
is euermore reputed to their glory and our diſgrace.</p>
               <p>If I were demaunded of the drift of my lines where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
they tended, I could not well make aunſwere on
the ſuddaine, yet I haue a meaning; but I am brought
into the laborinth of the <hi>Metaphiſickes,</hi> who wading in
a matter paſt their reach, woulde conclude of ſome
thing, but they know not what: I would approue by
reaſons, that the Iriſh are not to bee truſted, becauſe
they haue already ſo often deceiued: And yet I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
my ſelfe, for I know there be in Ireland, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of worthy ſubiects that cannot bee detected, nor
their fidelity and truſt to their Prince by any meanes
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16398:55"/>
impeached, and theſe doe not onelie deſerue to bee
countenanced, but likewiſe to bee cheriſhed; yet the
Traitor of Ireland, as well in words, in lookes, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance,
and in the whole courſe of his conuerſation,
doth ſo nearly reſemble and imitate the true meaning
man, that they canot be diſcerned nor diſtinguiſhed by
their outward ſhewes. It were therefore a deſperate
matter (and of no ſmall aduenture) to commit a truſt
to thoſe that are ſo hardly diſcerned. I will therefore
conclude nothing, yet I ſay, for him that is a knowne
Papiſt, I would neuer truſt his word, his promiſe, his
vow, nor (if it were for the Princes ſeruice) I would
neuer truſt his oath, for Papiſts when they ſweare fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſt,
they commonly lie faſteſt.</p>
               <p>I haue diſcouered my ſelfe to the full, and although I
haue thereby made my follie the more apparant, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
it may yet giue ſome little blaze of light to thoſe
that bee wiſe, for wiſe men may learne more from
fooles, then fooles from wiſe men: but the onely part
to play the foole well, is amongſt fooles to ſeeme to
be wiſe, yet I could bee contented to play the foole a
little, and ſo to be accounted amongſt our <hi>Iriſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,</hi>
if they would vouchſafe, but to draw a litle ſpark
of wiſedome from my ouer much folly.</p>
               <p>There were many matters more to be wiſhed for, but
wiſhing in Ireland is out of date, and our Engliſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants
do know it well enough; they haue therefore
ſo planted themſelues through euery part of Ireland,
that they are more pernitious in their example, then
the Iriſh themſelues.</p>
               <p>I may now conclude (and I hope with a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence)
that the Popery of Ireland, is the bar that exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all regard of duty, both to God and the King.</p>

               <head type="sub">Whether there be any poſsiblity that the Iriſh ſhould maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a warre againſt the Kings Maieſty.</head>
               <p>THE broiles that hath been ſtirred vp by Papiſts
in Ireland are infinite, and they haue coſt the
price of many mens liues, and the expence of
great ſummes of Treaſure.</p>
               <p>But methinkes, it cannot be called a warre, that is
maintained by Subiects againſt their Soueraignes: It
is for Princes to make warre that are abſolute, not for
Peſants that are diſſolute: And for this Papiſtical ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
that are euermore ſeditiouſlie contending
againſt their Soueraignes: I cannot do them ſo much
credite, to ſay they mainetaine warres, but that they
ſtirre vp tumults, diſcentions, vprores, commotions,
inſurrections, and giue them the beſt Titles that can
bee applied, and they are but rebellious, and they
themſelues are Rebels &amp; Traitors that do firſt vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them.</p>
               <p>Now, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhould haue any meanes or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
to beare out a rebellion againſt our gratious
King, I thinke there is no Souldier ſo vnwiſe to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fime
it.</p>
               <p>Wars are not to be performed without Souldiers,
nor ſouldiers can bee contained without pay; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
men, Mony, Munition, armor, weapon, &amp; a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of other neceſſaries belonging to Warre, there is
neyther meanes to conquour, nor hope to defend.</p>
               <p>What may we now thinke of the Iriſh; firſt their
greateſt wealth, wherewithall to maintaine a warre,
conſiſteth in Otmeale and Butter: their wiſedome is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16398:56"/>
our ouer-ſightes, their ſtrength our ſufferance; And
they haue euer beene more beholding to their Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
friendes with their <hi>Iriſh</hi> hearts, then to their wit,
their pollicie, their valiance, their wealth, or to any
other thing that Ireland could affoord them.</p>
               <p>They are altogether vnfurniſhed of all manner of
warlike neceſſaries, either for defence or offence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
are they able ſo to fortifie themſelues in any
ground of aduantage, but that we are ſtil able to fetch
them out by the eares, either by force or by engine:
they cannot deale ſo with the Engliſh: for they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
neither Artillirie to batter, nor meanes to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
a ſmall company of our Engliſh Souldiers
will make good any place againſt the whole forces
of the Iriſh, and although they be but ſlenderly forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
               <p>And I would but learne how it were poſſible for a
people (howe valiant or politique ſoeuer) that hath
neither Mint to make pay, ſhipping to tranſport, that
hath no manner of prouiſion, no ſtore, nor ſtore-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
furniſhed with Munition, Pouder, Shot, Peeces,
Pikes, Armory, Weapons, nor with a number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ingines and Implements belonging to the War,
without the which, a warre cannot bee maintained;
They haue no prouiſion for cariages, but what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
are able to carry vpon their backes, neither are
they able to leauy new forces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor haue they meanes
to ſupplie their olde, with conuenient neceſſaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to an Army. Now if it bee poſſible, that a
people thus diſtitute, ſhould be able to wage Warre
againſt ſo mightie and puiſſant a Prince, I will neuer
truſt experience againe ſo long as I liue. But let vs
looke into their abilitie, what they are able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:16398:57"/>
in the day of fight, and notwithſtanding that
I can take no exceptions to their ability of body, yet
being neither armed, with Corſlet, nor Pike (not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
conuenient number nor in able ſort) by this defect
they are not able to make a ſtand vpon any firme
ground, where our horſ-men are either able to charge
or chace them, neither are they able to indure the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
of our armed Pikes: ſo that vpon any equall
ground, that yeldeth no other aduantage then the
vertue or valiance of him that doth command, and
where Horſ-men &amp; foote-men may be both brought
to ſerue, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are not able to abide.</p>
               <p>The Horſe-men of <hi>Ireland;</hi> againe, are not fit to
ſerue in the time of fight, neither againſt Horſe nor
foote, vntill it doth come to a flat running retraite,
and then in a chace they are good for execution, but
otherwiſe, they can ſtand in little ſteede.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, by defect of their appointment, for
they are armed with a Skull, a Shirt of Maile, and a
Staffe, which as they vſe to cary, is of no ſeruice, but
for execution in a chace: and their Horſe likewiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as ſlightly furniſhed with a Padde, wherein the
Rider hauing neither Stirrops nor ſtay, no otherwiſe
then if he ſhoud ſit on the bare Horſe backe, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
quickly vnhorſed and eaſely ouerthrowne.</p>
               <p>I might farther inlarge, how they are not able to
vphold any Garriſons, nor to maintaine a Camp, nor
yet to conteine themſelues in any company, one
whole weeke together, but that they muſt betake
themſelues to their Woods, to their Bogges, and to
their ſtarting holes.</p>
               <p>I know I ſhall bee incountered heere with preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes,

               <p>To the end therfore, to make diſcouery why there

And all this (and much more then I haue ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

ruined and ſubuerted this worthy Princeſſe whom he

notable victories, and ſeuerall exploytes performed

               <p>Why then (will ſome ſay) if her Maieſtie were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

that there was neuer any great affinity betweene the

birth, they were yet ſo linked and combined with the
<hi>Iriſh,</hi> aſwell by Marriage, as by many other meanes,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:16398:58"/>
that I neuer knew ſo arrant a <hi>Traitor</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that
was deſtitute of <hi>Engliſh</hi> friendes, that would vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in his behalfe, yea although he were out in open
rebellion, that, they durſt not apparantly aduenture,
yet by ſecret meanes and practiſes, they would both
ſtraine themſelues and try their friendes, to helpe out
a <hi>Traitor</hi> when it cam to a pinch.</p>
               <p>Of this combination betweene the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> I might ſpeake more then perhaps would
bee thought neceſſary to bee openly publiſhed; and
it ſhould ſeeme, that our progenitors many ages ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
finding out the inconueniences, what hurt it
did, ſeeking meanes therefore to preuent it, they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by act of Parlament, that no man of the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
birth, ſhould haue charge or bee put in truſt, with
any Caſtle or place fortified, belonging to the Prince.
They were likewiſe prohibited, from diuerſe principal
affaires, and amongſt theſe prohibitions, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
were likewiſe inioyned, neither to Marry, foſter,
nor combine with the <hi>Iriſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I thinke our aunceſtors were not more carefull,
then we be now, but it ſhould ſeeme, they imployed
their cares better then we do now.</p>
               <p>Amongſt many reaſons that might bee rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
why the Engliſh ſhould bee ſo indeuouring
and helping to the Iriſh, there bee three eſpeciall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
more importing then the reſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt, is grounded vppon foreſight or proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
for thoſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> that haue ſettelled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with Landes or liuinges in the Countrey, do
finde it to bee a matter of approued policy, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
with thoſe of the Iriſh, that are moſt likelieſt
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:16398:59"/>
to play the Traitors, eſpecially, if they bee bounding
or bordring vpon him: for he thinketh by theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
not onely to ſaue his lands and tenementes from
the ſpoyle of the party himſelfe that is moſt likelie to
endanger him but alſo by being in league and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of ſuch a one, that is but in the ſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a demy-Traitor; that is, halfe in, and halfe out,
he hopeth by his meanes ſo much the rather to ſcape
ſcot-free, from the ſpoile of others: from which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of theirs, this prouerbe doth ariſe: <hi>That it is good
to haue a</hi> Rowland <hi>for an</hi> Olyuer: or after our Engliſh
interpretation; <hi>a Theefe to encounter a Theefe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond reaſon, that induceth the Engliſh to bee
ſo vndertaking for the Iriſh, is grounded vpon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
peraduenture ſome hundred Cowes, ſome
times more, and ſometimes leſſe: for guifts and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents,
though they conſiſt but in Cowes, in horſe, or
in ready money it ſelfe, will be receiued, and hee that
knoweth howe to ſteale from oue, and what to giue
to another, ſhall find friends.</p>
               <p>Now, a third reaſon, and that which moſt infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the Engliſh to ſtand ſo firme for the Iriſh, is, for
that it concernes our owne free-hold: for wee are ſo
linked and combined with them, what by marryeng,
what by foſtring, and what by one meanes or other,
that we muſt not ſee them quaile, wee muſt not ſee
them confounded but their hurts will be to our own
detriments if not of our ſelues, yet of our children of
our brethren, of our Coſines, of our wiues, of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
of our friends, or of ſome other ſuch of our fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
as we muſt put to our helping handes, wee muſt
not ſee them vtterly ouerthrowne.</p>
               <p>Who will demand now, how the Iriſh haue been
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16398:59"/>
able ſo to dally with their Priuce, &amp; to continue their
rebellions as in times paſt they haue done, when they
haue bin ſtill bolſtered out by the Engliſh, when they
haue had ſuch friends, that (if they could not preuaile
in Ireland) durſt aduenture to write into England, yea
ſometimes to the Queene hir ſelfe, and vnder thoſe
plauſible pretences of profit and pollicie, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,
what a ſparing it would be, both of money &amp;
of mens liues, that a Traytor that had committed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
ſpoiles, and ſpent hir Maieſtie huge ſummes of
money, ſhould be brought in by compoſition, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
or by protection, and how many waies it would
be auaileable to hir Highneſſe, that he ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
to mercie.</p>
               <p>And how many of theſe haue I knowne, that after
they had receiued all theſe fauours, and hauing again
ſtrengthened and enabled themſelues, haue watched
their oportunities, but to commit new ſtealths, and
to execute ſom other actions of villany, and thus go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out againe, haue been ten times more chargeable
then they were at the firſt.</p>

               <p>This Port-ſale of pardons, hath been the vtter vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
of Ireland: for what betweene thoſe pardons
that were ſent from the Pope, and the other againe
that were obtained from the Prince, euery Traytor,
euery Rebell, euery murtherer, euery Theeſe &amp; eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16398:60"/>
Robber, might put in practiſe what he liſted, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
dread or danger, for the Pope he diſpenſed on the
one ſide, and the Queene ſhe pardoned on the other,
and thus between them (as time and occaſion ſerued)
it was holden for the high way to preferment, for a
man to play the traitor, and to ſtirre vp Rebellion: for
he that was found to be moſt dilligent, moſt daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and moſt deſperate, in the execution of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
ſhould not onely bee ſure to haue a pardon, but
hee ſhould bee likewiſe gratified with a penſion, or
with ſome daily pay, from out of the Princes Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers.</p>
               <p>Now, who would forbeare to be a Traitour, or a
Rebell, or a Theefe, or to enter into any miſchiefe
whatſoeuer, that could ſtil warrant himſelfe a pardon
for a few ſtolen Cowes?</p>
               <p>This generality of pardons and protections, did
much harme in Ireland, for they ſtill gaue encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the ill diſpoſed to aduenture of any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
and to do any maner of villany what themſelues
liſted, and there wanted not thoſe that were fauorites

and manie other Grants, that were ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiciall
vnto the ſeruice of our late gracious Queen,
that ſhe had been better to haue giuen them ſtipends
of ſome thouſandes by the yeare to haue maintained
them in England, rather then to haue ſuffered them
to haue made ſuch Traffique in Ireland, as they did at
that time.</p>
               <p>As theſe Pardons were the onely encouragements
to giue daring Traitours to attempt againſt their
Prince, ſo they were againe the verie cauſe of diſmay,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16398:60"/>
whereby to terrifie the ſubiect from the ſeruice of his
Soueraigne: for when a Traitour was out in rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
thoſe that were bordering vpon him, that had beſt
knowledge in the ſtrength and faſtneſſe of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
durſt neuer ſerue againſt him; for they knew wel
enough that there was not a Rebell in Ireland ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
but that he had Engliſh friends to procure him a
pardon, and then they were ſure that the winding vp
would be (as it hath beene in many other things) that
he that ſhold oppoſe himſelf to ſerue his Prince faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
ſhould bee left to the ſpoile of a Traitour, who
hauing once made his owne peace by pardon or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
would liue to be reuenged of as many as had
ſerued againſt him.</p>
               <p>Is it now ſo much to be wondered at, that her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie

her Rebelles in Ireland, when by her ouer much cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,
ſhee defeated her ſelfe of their ſeruices, that

               <p>I might ſpeake further of Pardons, that hath beene
many waies more preiudicial, then I haue ſet downe:

               <p>THere is nothing wherein our Engliſh policy hath
beene more ouer-reached, then in mannaging
the Warres againſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> that were ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted

deluding parlies (which they tearmed times of <hi>Seſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>)

truces, though wee let ſlippe both time and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
yet the enemy forgat not to take all aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
For in thoſe dallying times of their deluding par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
the Rebels recouered <hi>Conaughe,</hi> they tooke <hi>Eniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaline,
Monohan,</hi> the <hi>Blackwatre;</hi> they ſupplied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with Wine, with <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> with Armor, with
Weapon, with Powder, with Shot, and with all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
neceſſaries whatſoeuer they wanted, from al the
parts of <hi>Ireland;</hi> yea, from out of <hi>Dubline</hi> it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The Preſidents are innumerable, what practiſes
haue beene performed in the time of parlies. And as
<hi>Alexander</hi> wold not admit of any of theſe night-ſtoln
victories, ſo amongſt the <hi>Romaines,</hi> theſe entertaining
of Truces was baniſhed as an enemy to their ancient
proceedings, who were ſtill deſirous to fight by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,

               <p>He only is iudged to be ouercome, that is not van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
by craft, nor by fraud, nor by fortune, nor by
chance, but onely by meere valiance.</p>
               <p>The time hath beene, when it was neuer deemed
to be a worthy victory, where the enemies courages
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16398:61"/>
were not daunted by true valiance and magnanimitie.</p>
               <p>But for the ſeruiees in <hi>Ireland,</hi> reſt is euermore
dangerous then raſhneſſe, and although it bee a foule
imputation for a Commander, to be reputed headie
or haire-brain'd, yet amongeſt the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> expedition
that is ſometimes vnſeaſonably taken, is more auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
and hath euer concluded with better ſucceſſe,
then this temporziing &amp; trifling out the time with
delayes and deluſions. For, the Rebel of Ireland, muſt
haue no leiſure to take his breath; he muſt be hunted
like the Fox that is new rouzed from his den, he muſt
be chaſed from Couert to Couert; and ply him thus
but one three Weekes or a month, and you quaile his
courage, his edge is taken off, and his pride is ſodainly
abated. But would ye haue a preſident, let me put you
in minde of the Traitour <hi>Odougherty,</hi> one of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
of the North of Ireland, a Champion of ſuch
worthineſſe, that the Papiſts were in great hope, that
he would haue proued no leſſe then a ſecond <hi>Tyrone;</hi>
but will you ſee what became of this mirrour of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity,
he compaſſed a plot of Treachery, and of
Treaſon both, but ſuch a plot as he could neuer haue
effected, but by the truſt that was repoſed in him by
the Engliſh. For this is the ground worke of all their
villanies: we aduance them, wee countenance them,
we credit them, and wee inable them; and this truſt,
and this confidence which we repoſe in them, giueth
them matter to worke vpon; and by this meanes, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dougherty</hi>
performed his enterpriſe without reſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,
and as he neuer ſtrooke ſtroke in the exploiting of his
villany, ſo he neuer ſtrooke ſtroke after, till his heade
was taken of, neither durſt he euer ſhew his face after,
but in woods and Bogges, where he thought to catch
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16398:62"/>
no harme. We ſee here the difference between expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and delay, for as <hi>Odougherty</hi> was ſpedy in the
execution of his miſchife, the Lord Deputy made as
quicke a diſpatch for the proſecution of reuenge, and
makinge a ſpeciall choice of a celected company for
the following of that ſeruice, there was one amongſt
the reſt (ſir <hi>Thomas Ridgway</hi> by name) who of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
diſpoſition (without weeting or knowledge of
his deareſt friendes) conueied himſelfe from his own
houſe, and cam to the place of ſeruice with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
man, and with the like ſpeede he ſo perſued the
Rebelles with ſuch iudgement, valiance and induſtry
(and many times with a farre leſſe company then the
Rebelles were in number) that they expecting a more
leiſurable purſute, ſuch as <hi>Tirone</hi> and other <hi>Traytors</hi>
had had before them (being now depriued of that
hope) they begane to faint at the firſt, and were in a
ſhort ſpace as eaſely ſurpriſed.</p>
               <p>Sedition durſt neuer yet attempt any thing valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the multitude, hath euer had more courage
to rebell then to fight.</p>
               <p>Now to be ſhort, it was the expedition of the Lord
<hi>Deputy</hi> and the dilligence of the <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> that brake
the neck of this rebellion in a much ſhorter time then
hath been acuſtomed: And as this preſident of theirs
may giue a further light for his Maieſties future ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
ſo by this it may appeare, that if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> be wel
followed with a direct courſe, they are of no ſuch abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,

               <p>THe greateſt matter reputed to bee in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in

a plot of <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and wit to conceale till

their greateſt courage afterwards, whereby to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

to light vpon them, they truſted better to their heeles
then they did to their handes.</p>
               <p>It will be ſayed, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in the time of <hi>Tyrones</hi>
Rebellion, ſhewed themſelues to bee men of better
worth, then I do ſeeme to account of them. And it
is truth, that in that Rebellion of <hi>Tyrones,</hi> they put the
Queene to a great expence of Treaſure, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the warre a much longer time then hath former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beene accuſtomed; but how it cam to paſſe, that
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were ſo inabled on the ſodaine, to maintaine
their Rebellion, and to continue it as they did, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were by any new ſupply either of ſtrength, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
force, or fortune, or by any other ability either
of body or minde, inſpired or infuſed into them more
then their predeceſſors haue had before them, this
would be knowne. And this I thinke were not vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to be deſcouered.</p>
               <p>I will not ſpeake how <hi>Tyrone</hi> was befrended by the
Engliſh, neither will I make any repetition, how the
Engliſh ſouldiors were generally enfeebled &amp; brought
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16398:63"/>
ſo weake that they were not able to perform a good
daies march (I will not ſay how it came ſo to paſſe,
but it is well enough knowne that ſo it was:) And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that this penury wherewith our Eng. troops
were thus pinched, had been enough to haue abated
the courages of the moſt able minded men, yet that
was not it that made <hi>Tyrone</hi> ſo potent as hee ſhewed
himſelfe, nor that did ſo much enable him againſt his
Prince.</p>
               <p>The matter that ſtrengthened him, was the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
ſupplies, aſwell of men as of munition, armor,
weapon, powder, ſhot, hee was ſtill furniſhed with
Souldiors, ready armed and trained at her Maieſties
coſts and charges, and it was hir Maieſties purſe that
releeued him from time to time, with thoſe ſupplies,
that he himſelfe (otherwiſe) had neuer beene able to
haue compaſſed.</p>
               <p>Our Aunceſtors many yeares ſince, that had ſome
ſpeculation in the Iriſh diſpoſition, foreſeeing well
enough the danger that might inſue, by training them
vp in any warlike diſcipline, thinking to preuent the
inconuenience; they ordained by ſtatute, that no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman,
ſeruing in that Countrey with command,
ſhould retaine into his Company of one hundred ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors,
aboue three Iriſhman at the vtmoſt, and theſe
were entertained rather for guides then for any other
expectation that was hoped for by their ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Whilſt theſe obſeruations were charily obſerued,
the Iriſh wer not able to make any encounter againſt
the Prince: and Ireland was able (not onely) to beare
it owne expences, but alſo to contribute to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Cofers, ſome twenty or thirty thouſand pounds,
per An. as appeareth by auncient records that are yet
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16398:63"/>
to be ſeene.</p>
               <p>By this wee might conclude, that it is better for
wayfaring men, to treade thoſe tracts already traced
out to their handes, then to ſeeke vnknowne waies,
that if they do not ſometimes leade aſtray, are ſure at
all times to leade the furtheſt way about: for if thoſe
Preſidents left by predeceſſors, had bin by vs as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
obſerued, as they were by them wiſely preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
the rebellious ſort of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had not beene ſo
wel inabled to haue maintained their rebelions, as now
of late they haue done: But <hi>Tyrone</hi> was the man that
the Iriſh did extoll, and <hi>Tyrone</hi> was the man that was
beholding to his Engliſh friends; hee was beholding
to thoſe deluding parlies, to thoſe deceitfull times of
ſeſſaſion, that gaue him ſtill opportunity to helpe
himſelfe by many aduantages: ſometimes when hee
was driuen (as it were) to the very laſt gaſpe, &amp; when
he was not longer able to hold out, then there was a
parle procured: by means whereof, he releeued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
with all manner of neceſſaries, and would lightly
enterpriſe ſomething, that was both to the diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
and diſhonour of the Prince.</p>
               <p>I haue already made mention of a preſcript, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our Engliſh Captaines were inioyned, that in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
company of one hundred, they ſhould not retaine
aboue two or three that were of the Iriſh birth, but
during the whole ſeaſon of <hi>Tyrones</hi> rebellion, there
were ſome companies, that for euerie three of the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> there were three and twentie of the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> and
to ſpeake truely, it might haue beene called a ſpeciall
and a choiſe company, that had not three <hi>Iriſh</hi> for one
<hi>Engliſh.</hi> How it fell out that our Engliſh Captaines
were thus inclined to entertaine the Iriſh, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16398:64"/>
the Engliſh, I ſhall not neede to make relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
there was a reaſon why, but they raked vp all the
Iriſh that were to bee gotten, that there was not a
Horſe-Boy left in the Countrey, but he was armed &amp;
trained, and when hee had committed inſufferable
ſpoiles, away he went to the enemy.</p>
               <p>The Rebels themſelues ſent as many Rogues as they
were able to procure, to be thus armed and trained, &amp;
to watch their oportunity to performe ſome exploit
of villanie, and ſo to make their returne.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, there were whole companies of the
Iriſh raiſed at hir Maieſties coſts and charges, &amp; that
receiued her daily pay, that were as arrant Traitors, as
any were with the Rebels, and committed as manie
ſpoiles, killing and burning onely excepted.</p>
               <p>All theſe, ſtill furniſhed <hi>Tyrone</hi> with daily ſupplies
of Souldiers that were thus armed and trained at her
Maieſties charge, and he had the like helpes to ſupply
himſelfe with many other wants, but eſpecially with
powder and ſhot, wherewith he was ſtil releeued from
out the Queenes ſtore; ſomtimes by thoſe <hi>Iriſh</hi> bands
and companies, that made more prouiſion for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels,
then they did for themſelues.</p>
               <p>Sometimes again by ſome Gentlemen of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
who vnder the pretence of making themſelues
ſtrong againſt the Rebelles, woulde fetch out of the
Queenes ſtore, Powder, Shot, Armour, Weapon,
and what beſides was there to be had, wherwith they
ſtill ſupplied <hi>Tyrone,</hi> who otherwiſe had neuer beene
able to haue maintained one good daies fight.</p>
               <p>I might yet ſpeake further, how that euery ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
fellow that kept a Shoppe, was ſuffered to ſell
Peeces, Powder, Swords, and ſuch other implements
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16398:64"/>
of War, not allowable for euery man to ſell, &amp; (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the ſtate of the Countrey) not ſufferable for
euery man to buy.</p>
               <p>I will heere couclude, how all that extraordinarie
Wiſedome, pollicie, and valiance, that was attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto <hi>Tyrone,</hi> was but our ouer-ſights, our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,
and our winking at that which was apparant
vnto euerie Wiſe mans eyes: and let the <hi>Iriſh</hi> proiect
vnto themſelues what they liſt (I ſay) if <hi>Tyrone</hi> had
beene as well hunted after as <hi>Odougherty</hi> was, he muſt
haue come vnto the verie ſelfe-ſame Market that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doughertie</hi>

               <head type="sub">That the Iriſh are more daungerous then neceſſary for his
Maieſties ſeruice in Ireland.</head>
               <p>IN euer read of any ſuch pollicie, where a rebellious
people, that were euerie day readie to reuoult
from their dutie vnto their Soueraigne, ſhould be
permitted to exerciſe chiualry, or ſhould be inured
with the practiſe of Armes: but I could ſet downe
a number of preſidents, how prudent and pollitique
Princes, when they haue beene ſo continually vexed
and vrged by rebellious Traitors, haue not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
them from the vſe of weapons, but haue alſo
reſtrained and depriued them from all manner of
practiſes appertaining vnto Warre, by the ſeuerity of
Lawes.</p>
               <p>I knowe amongſt the Nobilitie of Ireland, there
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16398:65"/>
hath beene (as there are ſtill) manie honourable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
(&amp; ſo there are of manie other Gentlemen) that
without all doubt are as forward, as readie, and as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to ſerue their Prince, as any other whoſoeuer. But
to ſpeake truely, ſithence I haue knowne Ireland, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
knew anie of the Nobilitie of that Realme, that
was able to performe anie ſeruice (that was woorth
the ſpeaking off) with their owne Countrey-men, in
the behalfe of their Prince, no not againſt a mean Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell:
ſuch a one as in a priuate quarrell, durſt not lifte
vppe a ſword againſt anie Noble man, that did dwell
neer or border vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. And this is a matter to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired,
that any thred-bare Rebel ſhould be ſo apt and
hardie to oppoſe againſt the Prince, and ſo timerous
againe to offend a Nobleman of his owne Countrey:
and it is no leſſe ſtrange, that euery Nobleman of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
ſhould be potent enough to right his owne cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
againſt anie of that ragged rabble, that dares but
look awry vpon him (as I could ſhew may preſidents)
and can performe nothing in the ſeruice of his prince,
no not againſt the moſt baſeſt Raſcall, that euer mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
vnder the Title of a Rebell.</p>
               <p>The Miſterie of this matter is eaſie to be decided,
for although I know that amongeſt the Nobilitie of
Ireland, there be ſome that would be both willing &amp;
deſirous to do the Prince vnfained ſeruice in their
own perſons, yet they themſelues know well enough
that they ſhall neuer be followed in thoſe indeuours:
their owne houſhold ſeruantes would faile them in
ſuch a caſe; and hee that could bring a thouſand fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
into the field, in an action of Rebellion; is not
able to bring one hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred, in the ſeruice of his Prince:
they are ſo vowed and proteſted to the Pope, that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16398:65"/>
they will not be induced to ſerue their prince, at the leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
not in that due reſpect of loue, that ſubiects are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
and doe owe vnto their Soueraignes. Perhaps in ſompti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
quarrell between themſelues, they may perform ſom
exployt the one againſt the other, but it ſhall be don more
in reuenge of their owne mallice, then for any loue they
owe to the ſeruice. There is nothing, wherein the <hi>Iriſh</hi> do
more priuily deride vs, then in this conceit that we haue of
their helpe: &amp; therfore they haue hatched vp this pretty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tergatory:
<hi>Where was it euer knowne, that one wolfe woulde
prey vpon another.</hi> And it hath euer beene thought a moſt
daungerous thinge, to haue friendes and enemies both of
one Nation. But I know the Iriſh did neuer want friends,
to perſwade that their ſeruice is verie behoouefull: it may
ſometimes ſerue indeed, to help to ſtop a gap, but I anſwer
it will ſhortly after break down the whole hedge, and it is
but a madde part for him that would defend an entry, to
ſhut vp the wicket, and then ſet ope the great gate.</p>
               <p>The Iriſh do but betray the ſeruice and ſtrengthen the
enemie (I ſpeake of the multitude) and to haue them tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as heretofore they haue bin, (eſpecially thoſe that are
ſo much addicted to the Pope) I ſay it is dangerous, and a
groſſe ouerſight. I haue hitherto diſplaied, (though not
all that I know) yet ſo much as I think neceſſary, the which
although it pleaſe not all, yet I would bee glad it ſhoulde
proue profitable to ſome. I haue but glanced at things, by
giuing them a touch and awaie, which if I ſhoulde inlarge
but as they deſerue, I might write a whole volume in folio.</p>
               <p>The vertue of things is not ſo much in their magnitude
as in their qualitie, and ſo likewiſe of reaſon, which beeing
wrapped in a few words, haue the beſt tongue.</p>
               <p>My purpoſe is to profit, not to pleaſe; to intice, not to
intrap; to councell, not to controle; and I rather deſire to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16398:66"/>
make my friends penitent, then leaue them inſolent.</p>
               <p>I haue directed my lines but to the forming of good
manners, and moderating of affections, and who can be
ſilent in theſe matters here handled, if he loue his prince.
And yet I know, that nothing can bee ſo well or proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
ſpoken, but mallice will finde matter whereat to
carpe and repine: yet I hope my good intent will be the
rather born with al, in that I do but ſet down precepts of
good councell, but not decrees to be reſolued on.</p>
               <p>I hope it will be accepted of by ſome, that will reape
profit by it, and find fit aduertiſements and examples for
them to imitate: which if it doe, I ſhall thinke my time
and labor the better beſtowed: if otherwiſe, my care is
the leſſe, becauſe it hath contented my ſelfe, in keeping
me from Idleneſſe.</p>
               <p>But I know ſome will ſay, it were as good be ydle, as
ill occupied: Tis true, There is no endeuour wherein a
man may buſie himſelfe, that is more diſtaſtfull then the
writing of books (eſpecially if they be of a reprehending
humor) but it is to thoſe that haue guilty conſciences,
but to men of pure and honeſt life, they little force what
any man can either write or ſpeake againſt them.</p>
               <p>I may ſpeake ſomething by experience, for I my ſelfe
haue been miſtaken, and am reputed to bee an open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all but for writing a Booke, entituled,
<hi>The Suruey of Ireland,</hi> wherein I haue laboured nothing,
but the diſcouery of the Pope.</p>
               <p>But ſuch is the malignity of Papiſts, that they cannot
indure to haue their Idolatry checked, no not with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents
and examples that are drawn from the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>Certaine Pagans offering outragious violence to a
Religious Chriſtian, mocking and vpbraiding him for his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:16398:66"/>
Religion, they asked him in the end, what profite hee
had by his Chriſt: Is not this a ſingular profit, quoth
he, Not to be moued with your bitter wordes, but to
pardon and forgiue the wronges you do vnto me.</p>
               <p>I anſwer with the Chriſtian: Let the Papiſtsly and
ſlander how they liſt, I thanke God, I am taught by
the Religion I profeſſe, to put vp all wronges and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries,
whatſoeuer they can offer vnto mee, and not
only to forgiue them their vpbraiding and deprauing
of me, but alſo pray to God that hee woulde ſo open
their eies, that they may ſee the right way of their
ſaluation.</p>
               <p>I hope there is no man that will accuſe me of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciality,
to ſay I haue more forborn to ſpeake againſte
the follies of the Engliſh, then againſt the manners &amp;
cuſtomes of the Iriſh: or that I doe otherwiſe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
betweene them, but value them both alike, the
good, to be good, and the bad, to be bad. I confeſſe
I haue bin very plain with the Cittizens of <hi>Dublin,</hi> but
it is thoſe that are only addicted to the Pope, it is with
thoſe that haue ſo be-puſſeld themſelues in Popery,
that they yeeld to a number of diſorders, that are no
leſſe odious in the ſight of God, then iniurious to the
King: yea &amp; to eclipſing the reputation of their City
if they did but well aduiſe themſelues, with diſcreet
conſideration.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it wil be imputed to me for an offence, that
I haue ſo avowed the greateſt number of the Iriſh to
be papiſts: But if Popery be ſo Catholike a matter as
they themſelues do beleeue, I haue then doone them
great honour and credit ſo to repute them, but if it be
a doctrine that ſeduceth, and that draweth ſubiectes
rather to Rebellion then to true obedience to their
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16398:67"/>
Princes, is it not then beſt to ſpeake the truth, if it be
but to ſhame the Deuill?</p>
               <p>And now to purge my ſelfe from any malicious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
I do heere proteſt before the face of the liuing
God, and do further auow it by that Religion that
I do openly profeſſe, that I do know neuer a Cittizen
in <hi>Dubline,</hi> nor any other perſon that is a natiue borne
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that I do either hate or diſlike; no, not hee
that hath done me the greateſt wrong, but do wiſh
him as wel as I wiſh to my ſelfe, that god would make
vs all wiſe, and ſet vs in the right tract that leadeth to
life euerlaſting.</p>
               <p>This is all the malice I beare them, this is all the
hurt I meane them, to this end and porpoſe I haue
written this Booke, not againſt any Papiſt in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
but againſt Popery in generall; for Popery in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is the original of a number of imperfections, that
otherwiſe would bee reformed, and it is Popery one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that hath ſecluded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> from
that perfect loue and amity, which elſe would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
on both partes aſwell to the glory of God, as
to the great benefit of this Countrey.</p>
               <p>God bring it once to paſſe, that wee might all
ioyne together as well <hi>Engliſh</hi> as <hi>Iriſh,</hi> in the true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of one God, of one Religion, of one
King, of one Law, and of one loue, this is all that I
wiſh for, and this is all that I haue indeuoured.</p>
