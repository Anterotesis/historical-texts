            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS to Dear <hi>George Gray,</hi> my dear Friend and Brother in the Service of the Bleſſed Truth, and my fellow-Sufferer in <hi>Aberdene</hi> Priſon; He was à man whom I greatly loved; for though he was a Poor Man in this World, yet he was rich in Faith; and though his Education was mean and low, he was endued with divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Underſtanding in the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65442:4"/>
things of God, and a good ſound and Solid Teſtimony he had in the Meetings of the Lords Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; inſomuch that many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering him in his place among Men, have taken notice of the Gift he had in Delivering his Teſtimony with that Soundneſs and Weight, as no Critical Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my did ever catch him in a Word, as ever I knew off; and I knew him at his firſt coming amongſt us; and the Love of God in my Heart was towards him; For I never found him under Blame, nor ever heard of any that could Juſtly Blame him, either in his Teſtimony, Life or Converſation ſince he was reſtored into the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Truth; but he was of a good Report.</p>
            <p>And when I heard of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away from amongſt us, I was ſatisfied in my ſelf
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65442:5"/>
(having that Conſtant experience of him in his Life time) that it was well with him; and it came near me, the Conſideration of the great loſs and miſs Friends in thoſe parts would have of him: But I live in the Hope that the Lord will in his own time raiſe himſelf up Faithful Labourers in the room of thoſe <hi>Worthy Men</hi> he hath been pleaſed to remove from us, and to take to himſelf of late in this Iſland of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and my Prayer to God is, through the Son of his Love, in the moving of his Holy Spirit, that all who remain behind, may ſo live and walk in Unity and Fellowſhip with the Lord God in the Spirit of his Son, and one with another, as that his Glory may ſhine forth thorow us all, to the reaching and gathering of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65442:5"/>
many more; and that all who are gathered may grow up in the Spirit and Power of the Lord God Almighty; That over all Heaven and Earth he may have his Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, Glory and Praiſe forever; <hi>Amen.</hi>

            </head>
            <p>AMong the many Watch-Men and Proclaimers of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Morning of the Everlaſting Day of our God, this faithful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument was one, who was raiſed up to Viſit, Salute and Comfort the Seed of God in this Nation of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to be as a Nurſing Father unto many Babes, and a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65442:6"/>
Communicator of Spiritual Gifts as a Faithful Steward to the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of God therein, Eſpecially in the Northern parts thereof, where his Comfortable Labours and uſeful ſweet Miniſtry moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was; and truely we can ſay, it is fulfilled as to him, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the Juſt doth flouriſh and remain as a freſh ſweet ſavour with many who know the Seals of his Miniſtry on our Hearts, and of Chriſt's ſpeaking in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thorow him, to the refreſhing, water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and building up of many in the Unity of the moſt pretious Faith and Love; which was the end of all the Gifts given by Chriſt Jeſus, as ſaith the Scripture: And truly his Gifts for this end, not onely of a large underſtanding in the Word of God's Wiſdom that dwelt richly in him, but alſo of utterance to expreſs and bring forth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65442:7"/>
the ſame abundantly, and with great and clear demonſtration of the Spirit, were much the more remarkable, that he was a mean un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettered Man, (except ſimply Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Writing) and of a very low condition in the outward; whereby his Maſters Power and Spiritual Wiſdom, and Furniture of Goſpel Miniſters (by which he doth immediately repleniſh them) did ſhine and evidence it ſelf the more clearly through him, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Exhortation of the Apoſtle, who ſaid, <hi>Let him that ſpeaketh, Speak as the Oracles of God, and him that Miniſters do it of the ability that God giveth him;</hi> So that he, being without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of mixture or aſſiſtance of the acquired Learning and Sciences ſo much admired in the World, and pretended (though falſly) to be the moſt neceſſary accompliſhment
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65442:7"/>
of Goſpel Miniſters; it hath been certainly known to ſome of us that very underſtanding Perſons (not of the Profeſſion he was of) have confeſſed their admiration at the utterance, excellent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and pertinent Conexion they obſerved in his Teſtimony, whom they knew to be no learned Man, as to outward Learning, being very apt to Judg (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their way) <note place="margin">His Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mens natural reach.</note> that the Teſtimonies of others among us (who they knew had ſome of that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) were hepled or furniſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; but as to him they were at a ſtand, judging it, as indeed it was, ſomewhat beyond their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reach.</p>
            <p>Now this Goſpel Miniſtry which he freely received, &amp; was not taught of man, or by man, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65442:8"/>
careful freely to give it forth for his Glory that gave it him, and to make it no wiſe chargeable to any; Yea, in this he might glory in his God, that his Hands miniſtred to his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities <note place="margin">His care not to make the Goſpel charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</note> by very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, diligent, hard Labour (at all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of his Miniſterial Services) in that outward Vocation and Trade he was off, being (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Lords Servants were of old) of a manual and mechanick Trade, which he kept moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and aſſiduouſly to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry end of his Dayes: Yea, ſo ſtead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly unmoveable was he in this his Principle of not making the Goſpel chargeable, and of being a good example in Laborious dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with his Hands (being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not ſloathful in buſineſs, though
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65442:8"/>
fervent in Spirit, ſerving the Lord) that his care on that account can hardly be expreſſed. His Care and Zeal was great, not only to have his own Converſation well order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but that the leaſt appearance of evil might be abſtained from by all Friends; and that all things that were truely Lovely, Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of good Report, and for the Honour of the Bleſſed Truth, might be Zealouſly followed, both by himſelf as an Example to the Flock, and by all others that were under the ſame Profeſſion with him: He truely loved to ſpend and be ſpent in the unwearyed Labours and Services of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; His Zeal therein was ſo great that it ſeemed even to ſpend his natural Strength, ſo that he did ſwiftly run his Bleſſed Race and lay down his earthly Tabernacle, (wherein he had ſerved the Lord
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65442:9"/>
with Cheerfulneſs) being about for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine Years of Age.</p>
            <p>A little before his departure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with the Power of the Lord, he gave weighty Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Counſel to all that were preſent, eſpecially to his Children. To ſome Friends that came to ſee him, he ſaid, <hi>He had not kept back</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Weighty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon his Death-Bed.</note> 
               <hi>the Word and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Lord from them, and now he could ſay, it was good Doctrine to leave nothing to do till a dying Bed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had been ſometimes much exerciſed in Teſtimonies at Fairs or Markets, and in Speaking to People out at the Priſon-Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows in the time of that long Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> wherein he was a faithful Yoke-fellow in Suffering for Truth, to his own great comfort and advantage (as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65442:9"/>
well as to the Honour of God) being ever after that Suffering to his dying-day, raiſed up in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Miniſtry for the Lord, who had given him not only to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but to ſuffer (with Joy) for his Name, both the impriſonment of his Perſon, and the ſpoiling of a great part of the mean outward Subſtance which he poſſeſſed.</p>
            <p>Among many remarkable paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which might be mentioned concerning him, this one thing was thought fit to be here inſerted; That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">A Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</note> once called to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare Truth in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Fair (or Market) in <hi>Old Meldrum,</hi> one pretending ſome Authority there, did violently beat him, who fell quickly after into a <hi>heavy diſeaſe and ſore pain,</hi> crying often out to ſome about him, <hi>that it was for beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Servant of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:65442:10"/>
He was little in writing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly (but hath left living E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles written in the Hearts of many) yet theſe two following Letters being providentially found, may ſerve for ſome taſte of his Spirit, being writ when he was but very Young in the Truth, and but entring in to his publick Miniſtry in the time of his Impriſonment.</p>
            <p>This Teſtimony concerning our Dear Friend, aforementioned, was given forth at our Mens Meeting at <hi>Aberdene,</hi> in the firſt Month, 1692. And ſubſcribed in behalf of the Meeting, by

            <head>A VVARNING TO THE Prieſts of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> Sent to them by <hi>George Gray,</hi> Weaver, and Priſoner for the Truth in the ſaid City, <date>the 6th Day of the 3d Month, 1676.</date>
            </head>
            <p>O Ye Prieſts of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> How long will ye reſiſt the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord? How long will ye deſpiſe Prophecying? How long will ye ſpeak lying Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and ſpeak Lyes in the Name of the Lord? How long will ye hold up mens Inventions,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65442:11"/>
and Traditions, and Cuſtoms, and Faſhions, after the Rudiments of this World, which muſt paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? How long will ye deceive your ſelves, and deceive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude others, by not knowing the Lord but by hear-ſay, and as ye have learned it as a Trade to gain Money withal? For all ye do, is for Hire; and if they give you no Money, then you will give them no Preaching nor Praying; and ſo it is a ſign and token that God never ſent ſuch to be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who will not teach with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hire and without Money; for ye are Teachers for your Backs and Bellys, and not careful to gain Souls to the Lord, and therefore Dreadful will the Day be that will come upon you when you will not be looking for it, and Wo and Miſery will overtake you before ye are aware.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65442:11"/>
O ye Prieſts, ye Prieſts, Woful and Dreadful is the Day which is approaching you, from the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful God of Heaven and Earth for your Covetouſneſs and Deceitful Dealing with poor People, poor indeed for want of the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God; for ye Murther and Kill their Souls with dead Lifeleſs Words, not coming to the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, nor yet ſpeaking in and from the Power and Life, but ſtealing and gathering Words from others, and out of old Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and Books, and tells that over, having it meaſured by an Hour-glaſs, and ſo, feed Peoples fleſhly Ears for a time, and learn them a notion, without any feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Life to their Souls, they not being ſpoken from the Life; and ſo People come bad, and go as bad away; yet for all that ye profeſs to be Miniſters of Chriſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65442:12"/>
Jeſus, and in the mean time you deny to be led, acted or moved by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or to wait for his Power, Spirit and Life to enable you therein; But upon the contrary, you do maintain that men may be ſufficient Miniſters, without Grace, <note n="*" place="margin">It is to be obſerved that the Prieſts of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene</hi> did ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contend againſt the abſolute Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Grace to the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt.</note> without the Power and Spirit of Chriſt; and that a Reprobate may be a Miniſter and Convert Souls: And for this cauſe ye hold people from the Power, and ſuffer them not to come to it, nor know it, but cry up the Letter of the Scripture to be the only and alone Rule; and reject the Spirit of Chriſt, as he reveals himſelf in Men and Women's Hearts by his Light. So ye are they that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the form of Godlineſs, and deny the Power thereof, you are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65442:12"/>
they that are <hi>Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt,</hi> which is the Power of God, <hi>your end is deſtruction, if you repent not, whoſe Belly is your God, who mind Earthly things,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get People into the ſame mind with you, in Pride, and Luſt, and Vanity, living <hi>without God in the World.</hi> O what will come upon you? O ye Prieſts, but anguiſh of Spirit, Tribulation and Horror of mind, which will make you to cry out, <hi>Wo, and alas! that ever we were born.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O Ye Prieſts, take Warning in time, and come out of your dark d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tful wayes, or elſe Darkneſs will be your Portion for ever, for they that hate the Light in their Life time, ſhall not enjoy it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: Therefore ye Prieſts, turn to the Light and believe in the Light, that you may become the Children of the Light, yea, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65442:13"/>
all your Hearers, and ſit down in Silence until the Lord by his Power, Spirit and Life, raiſe you up and open your Mouths, and then will you be true Miniſters; and never till then, pretend what you will. And ſo take Warning in time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the dreadful Day come upon you, which ſhall come upon all the Inhabitants of <hi>Babylon;</hi> which that ye may do, is the deſire of my Soul.</p>

            <head>A Copy of a Paper ſent by <hi>George Gray</hi> to the Country Meeting at <hi>Collihill,</hi> dated from the <hi>Tolbooth</hi> of <hi>Aberdene,</hi>

            <p>MY Dear Friends in the Truth, the Salutation of Love and Life be multiplyed in and among you from the Father of Life and Love, and in the ſence of the Pure Love of God which flows in my Heart towards you, do I warn and exhort you to walk in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth us to the World and the World to us, and watch in Patience &amp; Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Calmneſs of Spirit againſt every thing that would draw out the mind, in any meaſure, from the true Meeting-place, either in Meeting or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65442:14"/>
out of Meeting; For truly my Friends, he or ſhe that doth not watch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently out of Meeting, but let their minds go a gading to the ends of the Earth, and take no heed to have them gathered in before they come to Meeting, truely it's no wonder to ſee ſuch diſappointed; and therefore my dear Friends, be careful every one in particular to have your minds ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Lord, and the Lord will not be wanting to you; for great is his condeſcending to us in this day, and wonderful is his work to thoſe that truely watch and wait upon him.</p>
            <p>Therefore my dear Friends, every one know your place, and let not any go out nor look out beyond your meaſures; and let none Speak, nor Sing, nor Sigh, nor Groan but in a true ſence of their Conditions; and let none make haſte to ſpeak any thing before the Lord, which they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65442:14"/>
know not to be from the true power, but all to wait for the Power and Life and the Love of God; for truly where the Love of God is not placed in the Heart, the true Power will not attend their performances, neither will God regard their Speech or Prayer: Therefore dear Friends dwell in Love, and walk in Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all Men and Women, and feel the Love of God in your Hearts flowing forth to all, whether they love you or hate you; for truly my Friends, where hatred is brought forth againſt any Perſon, upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever account it be, although you may think the cauſe juſt, yet it will ſeparate you from the Love of God, for envy and hatred is of the Devil, and he is there where it is; and Chriſt Jeſus will not dwell with him in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; And therefore my dear Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Siſters, Love one another in that Love wherewith Chriſt hath
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65442:15"/>
loved you, and likewiſe your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, for Love gathereth to God, but envy ſcattereth; and therefore I warn you in the Fear and Dread of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting God, that ye be not Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of the Work of the Lord, for dreadful will their Portion be that let or hinder it in this day, or bring an evil report upon it: So take warning my Friends, and every one look to their way, and to the proſperity of Truth. And my Friends, I thought the Zeal of Truth ſhould have had more effect upon ſome then I ſee it hath; but I ſhall forbear, leaving eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to their own Maſter: But they that follow for Loaves and Fiſhes, when they get them not, they will fail even in that Zeal alſo.</p>
            <q>My Little Children, Love one another.</q>
