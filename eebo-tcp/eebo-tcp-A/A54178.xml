            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>As you were particularly in my thoughts upon the writing of theſe ſheets; ſo is it not leſs my deſire to make you particular in their publication.</p>
            <p>Many have been the Objections with which you frequently have beſet me on this account; but not with that ſucceſs I hope their Anſwers will have with you. My matter, ſtile and method ſpeak not the leaſt premeditation or ſingularity, but that ſimplicity and truth which plainly ſhow the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate ſincerity of my heart, and beſt wiſhes for your true happineſs; that from <hi>Defendants</hi> of vain, fooliſh, proud and wanton Cuſtoms, which exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the minds of men and women below the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of Immortality (the higheſt end of their Creation) you may become <hi>Diſciples</hi> of that ſelf-denying <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who firſt brought that great felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to light, and gladly Sacrifice your all, as but your reaſonable ſervice, in order to ſo glorious a Reward.</p>
            <p>By whatſoever is dear, I would beſeech you to relinquiſh <hi>that very vanity of vanities;</hi> I mean, thoſe Faſhions, Pleaſures, and that whole variety of
<pb facs="tcp:52319:3"/>
Converſation which make up the Life and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Age, and are thoſe earthy impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that clog your Souls flight to more ſublime and Heavenly contemplations: they were of old ſumm'd into three heads; <hi>the luſt of the eye, the luſt of the fleſh, and the pride of life,</hi> which are the off-ſpring of the World, and not of the Father.</p>
            <p>Reflect upon the incertainty of your lives, the Immortality of your Souls, and that Eternal ſtate they muſt be ſentenc'd to; but above all, be you intreated to eye that Divine Principle engrafted on your minds, in all its holy, meek, and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying inſtructions; that being moſtly exerciſed thereby, you may be wean'd from all the glittering Follies of the World (which only weak and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did ſpirits pleaſe themſelves withal) and ſenſibly experiment the inexpreſſible delights and raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Soul, which are the inſeparable compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſuch retirements. By which you may be lead into that temperance, piety and ſelf-denial, that will render you ſo many noble Witneſſes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the folly, luſt, and groſs intemperance of the Age, and unqueſtionably entitle you to Honor, Glory, Immortality and Eternal Life, then which, as there can be nothing more truly excellent; ſo, not any thing more earneſtly deſir'd on your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count by</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>THe Buſineſs of this Preface, is to requeſt of the <hi>Reader</hi> two things for his own ſake, which I have ſo much the leſs reaſon to doubt of being granted, as it would ſhow him very deſtitute of charity, who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully would be ſo injurious to himſelf: The firſt is, That he would be very <hi>Serious,</hi> remembring, that he who deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth what he does not know, beſpeaks himſelf a fool; as well as that he is injoyn'd to try all things, though only obliged to believe what is good The Subject is ſerious, for, it is the bleſſed Croſs of Chriſt; the work it is deſigned for is ſerious, for 'tis the Crucifixion of the vain, wanton and fleſhly appetites of worldly men; and if the Reader be ſo too, I queſtion not but the Juſt Principle (to which I make my appeal) will juſtifie me, and it become inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to his convincement; but if he ſhall demean himſelf with crittical and frothy jeſts, I can only ſay the greater ſhall be his condemnation yet let him remember, that it is the purpoſe of this Diſcourſe to prove what Jeſus Chriſt hath ſaid; namely that for every idle word he ſpeaks, he ſhall render an account in the day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>The next thing I have to ask, is, that he would be <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial;</hi> for he that reads, and makes his prejudic'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions mine; or ſeems to ſlight the Subject, Book, or Matter, becauſe he diſreſpects the Author or his Opinions in other points, may give ſufficient evidence of his own weakneſs, but not diſcover mine, ſince there is not <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

not more wretched then common: Nay, 'tis the Doctrine, Uſe and Application of too many to learn people to hate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Principles in order to deteſt their perſons, and ſo from an Opinion-difference bring it into a perſonal one, from whence flows all the malice and bitterneſs that reign amongſt thoſe who are called Chriſtians; but if this Reader be ſuch a one, he is either an ill Teacher, or very ill taught; I onely have to tell him, that as ſuch pre-opinion prevents all clear and certain examination of things, (by which he is at a loſs about his own faith and other mens) ſo if he would be benefited by this Diſcourſe; if he would read the character and condemnation of a wicked world; and if he would be truly inform'd of that Life and Converſation which are according to godlines, and give entrance after time ſhall end, into the endleſs Joys of an Eternal Glorious Reſt and Habitation in the Heavens, let him be <hi>Serious,</hi> let him be <hi>Impartial:</hi> And may that Almighty Power, which raiſed Jeſus from the Dead, quicken his mind, and raiſe his affections to the knowledge and poſſeſſion of Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; which as it is the whole requital I deſire for my exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love and earneſt deſires for the reformation of an intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and voluptuous World, to the Self-denying Life, and Innocence of Holy Jeſus; ſo ſhall it be a matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing to all the Faithfull.</p>

The Effects of Pride and Wontonneſs, deſtructive of Labour, Induſtry, Health, Body and Soul; they enſnare the affections, divert the Soul from Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Eternal Delights; they are the more pernitious, becauſe they ſeem more innocent then groſſer evils; they occaſion Debts, Poverty, Worldly-mindedneſs, and all

a ſign of a decaying Faith; yea, ſo great is the glory and ſplendor of Chriſt in a pious Soul; that all the glories of the world have no charms, no beauty in compariſon of that unto one ſo religiouſly inclined; the Apoſtle maketh ſuch reſpecting of perſons to be repugnant to the LIGHT within them, inſomuch, as they who follow thoſe practiſes are condemned from within themſelves; ſo that ſanctity ought to be the reaſon, or motive, of all outward Reſpect, and that none is to be honoured upon any account but holineſs:</q> But if ſo, doubtleſs thoſe <hi>Nuſeries of fantaſtick Cringers, antick Dancing-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and flattering Temporizers</hi> will be of very little repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but I ſhall add to theſe the Admonition of a learned Writer, called a Father, who lived aboue 1100 years ſince, of great eſteem both with Proteſtants and Papiſts; namely, <hi>Jerome,</hi> who writing to a noble Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron <hi>Celantia,</hi> directing her how to live in the midſt of her proſperity and honors, amongſt many other Religious Inſtructions, ſpeaks thus: <hi>Heed-not thy Nobility, nor let that be a reaſon for thee to take place of any; eſteem not thoſe</hi>

what paſt between <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> and <hi>Paulinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nola;</hi> (but ſuch a one as gave all to redeem Captives) he brings it in thus: <q>He is not counted a civil man now, of late years amongſt us, who thinks it much, or refuſeth to ſubſcribe himſelf Servant, though it be to his equal or inferiour, yet <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> was once ſharply chid by <hi>Paulinus</hi> for ſubſcribing himſelf his SERVANT in a Letter of his, ſaying, Take heed hereafter how thou being from a <hi>Servant called into Liberty,</hi> doſt ſubſcribe thy ſelf <hi>Servant</hi> unto one who is thy <hi>Brother,</hi> and <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Servant;</hi> for it is a <hi>ſinfull flattery,</hi> not a <hi>teſtimony of humility</hi> to pay thoſe honours to a man, and a ſinner, which are due to the <hi>one Lord, one Maſter,</hi> and <hi>one God.</hi>

firſt Inſtitution is groſly perverted; the utmoſt ſervice that Cloaths originally were deſigned for, when ſin had ſtript them of their native Innocence and great ſimplicity, was to cover their ſhame; therefore plain and modeſt: next, to fence out cold, therefore ſubſtantial: Laſtly, to differ. Sexes, and therefore diſtinguiſhing; ſo that then meer neceſſity provok'd to Cloathing, now pride and vain curioſity: In former times ſome benefit obliged, but now wantonneſs and pleaſure: they minded them for covering, but now that's the leaſt part; their greedy eyes muſt be provided with gaudy ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities, <hi>as if they made their cloaths for triming; and as the leſs ſerviceable part, only for the ſake of other curioſities that muſt be tack'd upon them, although they neither cover ſhame, fence from cold, nor diſtinguiſh ſexes; but ſignally diſplay their wanton, fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, full-fed, minds.</hi> Then the beſt of Recreations was to ſerve God, be juſt, follow their vocations, mind their flocks, do good, exerciſe their bodies in ſuch practices as might be ſutable to gravity, temperance, and virtue; which now is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to almoſt every folly that carries any mark below open and ſcandalous filth (deteſted of the very Actors when they have done it) <hi>ſo much are men degenerated from</hi> Adam <hi>in his diſobedience;</hi> ſo much more confident and artificial are they grown in all Impieties; yea, their minds through cuſtom are become ſo very inſenſible of the inconvenience that attends the like follies, that what was once meer neceſſity, a badge of ſhame, at beſt, but a meer remedy; is now the delight, pleaſure, and recreation of the Age: How ignoble is it, how ignominious, and unworthy of a reaſonable Creature? <hi>That which is indued with underſtanding ſit to contemplate immortality, and made an aſſociate for God and Angels, ſhould mind a little dust, a few ſhameful raggs, inventions of meer folly; toyes ſo apiſh and fantaſtick, entertainments, ſo dull and earthy,</hi> that a <hi>Rattle,</hi> a <hi>Baby,</hi> a <hi>Hobby-horſe,</hi> a <hi>Top, are by no means ſo fooliſh in a ſimple Child, nor unworthy his thoughts; as that the like inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould exerciſe the noble mind of man and Image of the great Creator of Heaven and Earth:</hi> This the very Heathens of old had ſo clear a proſpect of, that they deteſted all ſuch foolery; looking upon curioſity of Apparel, and that variety of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations

O that Men and Women would once be ſo charitable to themſelves, as to remember whence they came, what they are doing, and to what they muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; that more noble, more virtuous, more rational, and heavenly things, may be the matters of their pleaſure and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; that they would once be perſwaded to believe, how inconſiſtant the folly, vanity, and converſation they are moſtly exerciſed in, really are with the true Nobility of a reaſonable Soul; and let that juſt Principle which taught the Heathens, teach them, leſt it be found more tollerable for Heathens, than ſuch Chriſtians, in the day of account; For if their ruder notions, and more imperfect ſenſe of things, could yet diſcover ſo much vanity; if their Light condemn'd it, and they in obedience thereunto, diſus'd it, it behoveth Chriſtians much more: Chriſt came not to extinguiſh, no, but to improve that Knowledge; and they who think they need do leſs now than before, had need to act better than they think.—We therefore hence conclude, That the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and recreations now in repute are very abuſive of their firſt Inſtitution, if ever they had any; and that the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies that have attended them, as <hi>wantonneſs, idleneſs, pride, lust, reſpect of perſons,</hi> (witneſs a Plume of Feathers, or a lace Coat in a Countrey-Village, nay, almoſt any where; what ſirring? what ſcraping? what bowing? though perhaps he be a High-way-man, rotten in body, and ſoul too) with

The other he characters as a moſt ſevere reprehender of faults; from which I gather, that their deſign was not to feed the idle lazy fancies of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but ſince, by the means of looſe wits, the People had been debauch'd, their work was to reclaim them; and this appears the rather from the deſcription given, as alſo that <hi>Euripides</hi> was ſuppos'd to have been torn in pieces by wanton Women; which doubtleſs was for declaring and decrying their impudence: and the other being ſlain in the Battel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Athenians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> was ſo regreted, that a Law was made, never after ſuch <hi>Poets</hi> ſhould be allow'd to bear Arms; doubtleſs, becauſe in loſing him, they loſt a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover of Vice; ſo that the end of the approved <hi>Comedians,</hi> and <hi>Tragideans</hi> of thoſe times, was but to reform the People; and that not ſo much by that rational and argumentative way (uſual with their <hi>Philoſophers)</hi> as by ſharp <hi>jeers,</hi> ſevere <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,</hi> and rendring their vicious actions ſo ſhameful, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and deteſtable, as for reputations ſake they might

not longer be guilty of the like; which is but the very next expedient before a <hi>Whip,</hi> or <hi>Bridewel.</hi> Now if you that plead for ſuch repreſentations, will be contented to be accounted <hi>Heathens,</hi> and thoſe of the more diſſolute and wicked ſort too, we ſhall acknowledge you, that ſuch <hi>Comoedies</hi> and <hi>Tragedies,</hi> may be ſerviceable; but for ſhame abuſe not the Name of <hi>Christ</hi> ſo impudently as to call your ſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> whoſe luſts are ſo ſtrong, as that you are forc'd to uſe the neceſſities of meet <hi>Heathens</hi> to repel them: Is this your love to Jeſus? your reverence to the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that are able to make the man of God perfect? Is all your prattle about <hi>Ordinances, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Chriſtianity,</hi> and the like, come to this? that at laſt you muſt betake your ſelves to ſuch Inſtructers as were by the ſober <hi>Heathens</hi> appointed to reclaim the moſt vicious of the People that were amongſt them; and ſuch <hi>Remedies</hi> too, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low which is nothing but <hi>corporal puniſhment.</hi> This is ſo far from <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> that many thouſands of the Noble <hi>Heathens,</hi> Men and Women, were better taught, and better diſpos'd: <hi>They found out more Heavenly contemplations, and ſubjects of an Eternal nature to meditate upon.</hi> Nay, ſo far did they out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrip the beſt of the common <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of theſe times, that they not only were exemplary of good in their <hi>grave and ſober Converſation;</hi> but for the publick benefit, they inſtituted the <hi>Gynaecoſmi,</hi> or <hi>twenty men, that they ſhould make it their buſineſs to obſerve the peoples Apparel and Behaviour; that if any were found immodeſt, and to demean themſelves looſely, they had full authority to puniſh them.</hi> But the caſe is alter'd; 'tis puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reprove ſuch; yes, it's matter of the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumely and reproach: nay, ſo impudent are ſome grown in their Impieties, as that they merrily can ſport themſelves with a meer mockage of ſuch religious Perſons; and not only manifeſt a great neglect of <hi>Piety,</hi> and a <hi>ſevere Life,</hi> by their own looſneſs; but their extream contempt of it, by rendring it ridiculous through <hi>Comical abuſive jeers</hi> on <hi>publick Stages:</hi> which, how dangerous it is, and apt to make Religion of little worth; beſides the demonſtration of this age; let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> had not a better way to bring the reputation of <hi>Socrates</hi> in queſtion with the People; who greatly

                        <hi>for all his ſteps are numbred;</hi> in his touch, in his ornaments, in his hearing, ſight, ſpeech, and other vanities. And therefore we will prove firſt by the Scripture, and afterwards by divers other Reaſons, how wicked a thing it is to dance. The firſt teſtimony that we will produce, is that which we read in the Goſpel, where 'tis ſaid to pleaſe <hi>Herod</hi> ſo well, <hi>that it cost</hi> John Baptiſt <hi>his life.</hi> The ſecond is in <hi>Exodus,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> coming near to the Congregation, ſaw the Calf, <hi>he caſt the Tables from him, and broke them at the foot of the mountain, and afterwards it coſt three and twenty thouſand their lives.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Ornaments which Women wear in their dances, <hi>are as Crowns for many victory's</hi> which the Devil hath got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Children of God. For the Devil hath not only one Sword in the dance, but as many as there are beautiful and well adorned Perſons in the dance; for the <hi>words of a Woman are a glittering ſword.</hi> And therefore that place is much to be ſeared wherein the Enemy hath ſo many <hi>ſwords,</hi> ſince that one only <hi>ſword</hi> of his may be (juſtly) feared.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>Again, The Devil in this place ſtrikes with a ſharpned ſword; for, <hi>the Women</hi> (who make it acceptable) <hi>come not willingly to the dance, if they be not painted, and adorned; that which (painting and ornament) is as a Whetſtone, on which the Devil ſharpneth his ſword.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>Again, The Devil in the dance uſeth the ſtrongeſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that he hath; for his moſt powerful arms are <hi>Women;</hi> which is made plain unto us, in that the Devil made choice of the Woman to <hi>deceive the first Man;</hi> ſo did <hi>Balaam,</hi> that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might be rejected (of God.) By a woman he made <hi>Sampſon, David,</hi> and <hi>Abſolom</hi> to ſin.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>The Devil tempteth men by women three manner of wayes; that is, by the <hi>Touch,</hi> by the <hi>Eye,</hi> by the <hi>Eare;</hi> by theſe three means he tempteth fooliſh men to <hi>dancings; by touching their hands, beholding their beauty, hearing their ſongs and muſick.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>Again, They that dance break that Promiſe and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they have made with God in Baptiſm, when their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers promiſe for them, <hi>That they ſhall renounce the Devil and all his pomp; for dancing is the pomp of the Devil, and he that danceth maintaineth his pomp, and ſingeth his maſs.</hi> For the Woman that ſingeth in the dance, <hi>is the Prioreſs (or chiefest) of the Devil; and thoſe that Anſwer are the Clerks, and the Beholders are the Pariſhioners, and the Muſick are the Bells, and the Fiddlers the Miniſters of the Devil.</hi> For as when Hoggs are ſtray'd, if the Hog-herd call one, all aſſemble themſelves together; <hi>ſo the Devil cauſeth one Women to ſing in the dance, or to play on ſome Inſtrument, and preſently gather all the dancers together.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>Again, In a dance, a man breaks the Ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God: As firſt, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Godds but me &amp;c.</hi> for in dancing a man ſerves that Perſon whom he moſt deſires to ſerve, (after whom goes his heart:) and therefore <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every man's Godd is that he ſerves and</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Jerom in dec. inc. oper.</note> 
                        <hi>loves beſt (and that he loves best, which his thoughts wander and gadd most after.)</hi> He ſins againſt the ſecond Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>when he makes an Idol of that he loves.</hi> Againſt the third, <hi>in that Oaths, (and frivolouſly uſing God's Name) are frequently amongst dancers.</hi> Againſt the fourth, <hi>for that by
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52319:50"/>
dancing, the Sabbath day is prophaned.</hi> Againſt the fifth, <hi>for in the dance, Parents are many times diſhonour'd, ſince thereby many bargains are made without their counſel.</hi> Againſt the ſixth, <hi>A man kills in dancing, for every one that ſets about to pleaſe another, he kills the ſoul as oft as he perſwades unto lust.</hi> Againſt the ſeventh, <hi>For the party that danceth, be it male or female, committeth adultery with the party they lust after; for he that looketh on a Woman to lust after her, hath already com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Adultery with her in his heart.</hi> Againſt the eighth Commandment, <hi>A man ſins in dancing, when he with draweth the heart of another from God.</hi> Againſt the ninth, <hi>when in dancing he ſpeaks falſly against the Truth, (and for ſome little honour, or ſecret laſcivious end, deny's what's true; or affirms what's falſe.)</hi> Againſt the tenth, <hi>when Women affect the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of others, and Men covet the Wives, Daughters, and Servants of their Neighbours. (which undeniably attends all ſuch Playes and Sports.)</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Again, A man may prove how great an evil dancing is, by the multitude of ſins that accompany thoſe that dance; for they dance without meaſure or number: And therefore, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine, The miſerable Dancer knows not, that as many</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Anguſt. de Civit. Dei.</note> 
                        <hi>paces as he makes in dancing, ſo many leaps he makes to Hell.</hi> They ſin in their Ornaments, after a Five-fold manner. Firſt, <hi>By being proud thereof.</hi> Secondly, <hi>By inflaming the hearts of thoſe that behold them.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>When they make thoſe aſham'd that have not the like Ornaments, giving them occaſion to covet the like.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>By making Women impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in demanding the like Ornaments of their Husbands.</hi> And Fifthly, <hi>When they cannot obtain them of their Husbands, they ſeek to get them elſewhere by ſin.</hi> They ſin by ſinging and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on Inſtruments; <hi>for their ſongs bewitch the hearts of thoſe that hear them with temporal delight, forgetting God; uttering nothing in their ſongs but lyes and vanities; and the very motion of the body which is us'd in dancing, gives teſtimony enough of evil.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Thus you ſee that dancing is the <hi>Devils Proceſſion,</hi> and he that enters into a dance, <hi>enters into the Devil's Proceſſion.</hi> Of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52319:50"/>
dancing, the Devil's the <hi>guide,</hi> the <hi>middle,</hi> and the <hi>end;</hi> and he that entreth a good and a wiſe man into the dance, (if it can be that ſuch a one is either good or wiſe) cometh forth a corrupt and a wicked man: <hi>SARAH,</hi> THAT HOLY WOMAN WAS NONE OF THESE:</q> Behold the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of thoſe ancient good old Reformers, touching thoſe things that are ſo much in Practice and Reputation in theſe times; thus far <hi>verbatim.</hi> But I cannot leave off here, till I have yet added the Concluſion of their Chatechiſm and Direction, with ſome paſſages out of one of their Paſtors Letters; fit to the preſent occaſion.</p>
                  <p>They Conclude in this Direction; namely, how to rule <note place="margin">Ibid. lib. 2. Concl. p. 68. Encar en qual manier. fidel debian regir li lor Corps. Non ſervir a li deſirier mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, &amp;c.</note> their bodies, and live in this World as becomes the Children of God. <q>Not to ſerve the mortal deſires of the fleſh. To keep their Members that they be not arms of Iniquity, (and vanity) <hi>To rule their outward ſenſes. To ſubject the body to the ſoul.</hi> To mortifie their members. <hi>To fly idleneſs. To obſerve a ſobriety and meaſure in their eating and drinking, in their words and cares of this life.

you, my Brethren, (hereby acquiting my ſelf of that duty which I owe unto you all, <hi>in the behalf of God,</hi> principally touching the care of your Souls Salvation, according to that light of the truth which the moſt High God hath beſtowed on us) that it would pleaſe every one of you, <hi>to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, increaſe, and nouriſh to the uttermost of your power, without diminution, thoſe good beginnings and examples which have been left unto us by our fore-fathers, whereof we are no wayes worthy.</hi> For it would little profit us to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed <hi>by the Fatherly viſitation, and the light which hath been given us of God,</hi> if we give our ſelves to <hi>worldly, carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, which are diabolical, abandoning the Principle which is God, and the Salvation of our Souls, for this ſhort and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life.</hi> For the Lord ſaith, <hi>What doth it profit a man to gain the whole world, and to loſe his own Soul?</hi> For it would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us never to have known the way of Righteouſneſs, than having known it, to do the contrary.
