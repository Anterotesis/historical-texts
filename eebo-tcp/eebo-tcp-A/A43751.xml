            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MOſt dear and well-beloved <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> who have received <hi>Grace, Mercy,</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> from God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in this the glorious Day of his bleſſed Appearance, with the day-ſpring from on High, unto the turning of your Captivity, and freely ranſoming your Souls out of the horrible Pit and Gulf of darkneſs and miſery, which is the dwelling (you know) of all the Children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
            <p>O ye <hi>dear Children</hi> of the Light, <hi>and true born Sons of the Morning;</hi> you above all the Families on the Earth are known unto the Lord, through your <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> unto Chriſt, the true Light and Power of God, who is indeed become the <hi>Captain of our Salvation;</hi> and you whoſe Souls are made ſubject to the Light and Power of his eternal Spirit, and become Followers of the Son of God, <hi>the Lord from Heaven,</hi> who is a <hi>quickening Spirit;</hi> here his precious Life is felt, known, and enjoyed by all his faithful Followers; and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are you, ye dear and well-beloved of the Father, who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come willing and obedient Followers of the Lamb in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in this the day of his mighty Power and bleſſed Appearance unto you all, who were once (as well as others) ſcattered upon the barren <hi>Mountains,</hi> and knew not the voice of the Shepherd of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and then, Oh then, what were your <hi>Travels,</hi> your <hi>Sorrows,</hi> and <hi>Weepings,</hi> and <hi>Mourning,</hi> becauſe of the want of your <hi>Beloved!</hi> This was once my ſtate with you, O ye that were oppreſſed, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in ſpirit, and travelled in pain, until the dawning of the Light and Day of the Lord, that we came to ſee Him whom our

Souls loved, and to follow him faithfully in Righteouſneſs, who is now become our <hi>Leader</hi> and <hi>Commander,</hi> and the <hi>Captain of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> Oh! what might we now ſay of the wonderful Works of the Lord our God, which he hath wrought for us, and in us, ſince the day of his bleſſed Appearance, that our Souls became ſubject unto his Power, and Followers of Him in Spirit and in Truth? Oh! how did he utter his Voice againſt the man of Sin, inſomuch that the Earth did <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>tremble</hi> at his Appearance? And how cauſed he the Rocks and the Mountains to melt as wax before Him? for his Appearance was to Ranſom his own Seed that was then in great <hi>Captivity</hi> and <hi>Bondage,</hi> and to chain the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> that <hi>crooked Serpent,</hi> never more to <hi>Deceive.</hi> Oh, this is He whom we have ſeen and known, leading Captivity captive; and He it was that wounded and healed, that killed and made alive, that the living might praiſe and magnifie his Name, that now lives and reigns for ever, and for evermore.</p>
            <p>O ye <hi>Children</hi> of the Light, and Sons of <hi>Sion</hi>'s <hi>King,</hi> there's none knows the Womb of your Conception, but the Children of her own Bowels, who is the Mother of us All; nor none of the Sons of Bondage knows the <hi>Royalty</hi> of your Birth and Generation, but thoſe of the ſame <hi>Off-ſpring</hi> and <hi>Linage,</hi> of the everlaſting Seed of bleſſing, unto which all the Promiſes of God are <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen</hi> for evermore.</p>
            <p>And, O thou Daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> there's no Stranger that ever knew the Travel and Sorrow of thy day before Conception, and now indeed there's none of the uncircumciſed Children of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

that thou mighteſt be his own Beloved, and his <hi>peculiar Treaſure,</hi> and the <hi>choiceſt</hi> of ten thouſands.</p>
            <p>O ye dearly beloved of my Soul, ſurely that eye which hath ſeen the great and wonderful Works of the Lord our God, wrought in us and for us, cannot but <hi>admire</hi> his infinite glorious Acts, even with great <hi>Admiration.</hi> And certainly that Heart that underſtands theſe things cannot but <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>dread,</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> his holy <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> even from henceforth and for evermore.</p>
            <p>Now at his firſt Appearance (dearly Beloved) you know, it was he that made us to differ from the world of Ungodly, he made us ſenſible of his eternal Light and Truth ſhining in our hearts, and thereby he gave us an underſtanding to eſchew the evil, and cleave unto that which was good, and thus he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our minds, and converted our hearts, from the darkneſs unto the Light, and from <hi>Satan's</hi> power unto the power of the Lord our God. And in this eternal Power and Spirit, in the Light of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we have waited upon him, and he hath been with us, and anſwered us, and now dwells in us and amongſt us, according to his Promiſe, and he is become our <hi>Teacher</hi> and <hi>Leader, and the Captain of our Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus he becomes <hi>Wiſdom, Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> unto all his faithful Followers, whom he hath led, and is leading, (as his ranſomed Ones) out of the great <hi>Captivity,</hi> and <hi>Bondage,</hi> and <hi>Servitude</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> the power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who hath ruled in times paſt, as <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King</hi> over them, and hath led them (alſo) captive at his will, into the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence againſt God.
