            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury; this Cauſe is between the King and Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton,</hi> and it is upon an Information exhibited by Mr. <hi>Attorney General,</hi> wherein he ſets forth, That there having been lately a Horrid Plot diſcovered (as appears by the Convictions of thoſe that have ſuffered juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it, and by the Evidence that has been given of it, has been made ſo apparent, that I do not queſtion, but that no man but who either has a hand in it, or elſe bears a good will to it, doth at all ſcruple the belief of it) Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton</hi> the Defendant intending to ſcandalize and vilifie the Evidence, wrote a Letter wherein are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained theſe Sentences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47162:5"/>
                  <hi>The return of the Duke of</hi> Monmouth <hi>to</hi> White-Hall, <hi>and his being received into extraordinary Favour of his Majeſty, hath made a ſtrange alteration of affairs at Court; for thoſe that before ſpake of him very indecently, now court, cringe and creep to him. His Grace complained to the King of the ſcandalous miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that was made of him in the</hi> Mondays <hi>Gazette, upon which the Gazetter was called to accompt for it, who alledged for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that a Perſon of great Quality ſent him in writing the words therein recited, commanding him to put them in the Gazette. Yeſterday being the laſt day of the Term, all the Priſoners that were in the Tower upon the late Sham Proteſtant-Plot, were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged upon Bayl. Mr.</hi> Bradon <hi>who proſecuted the Murther of the Earl of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>the Information put in againſt him in the Kings-Bench by Mr.</hi> Attorney <hi>for a pretended Subornation</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was not proſecuted, and his Bail was diſcharged. And the paſſing Sentence upon the Author of</hi> Julian <hi>the Apoſtate, and the Printer of the late Lord</hi> Ruſſels <hi>Speech was paſſed over with ſilence. Great applications are made to his Majeſty for the pardoning Mr.</hi> Sidney <hi>in the Tower, which is believed will be attained, and that he will be baniſhed. The Lord</hi> Howard <hi>appears deſpicable in the eyes of all men; he is under guard at</hi> White-Hall, <hi>and 'tis believed will be ſent to the Tower, for that the Duke of</hi> Monmouth <hi>will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him concerning the Teſtimony he hath given, and the Papiſts and High Tories are quite down in the mouth, their Pride is abated, themſelves and their Plot confounded, but their Malice is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged. Tis generally ſaid the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>was murthered. The brave Lord</hi> Ruſſel <hi>is afreſh lamented. The Plot is loſt here, except you in the Country can find it out amongſt the Adreſſers and Abhorrers. This ſudden turn is an amazement to all men, and muſt produce ſome ſtrange events, which a little time will ſhew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then he goes on further, and ſaies in another Letter theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am to anſwer yours of the</hi> 27 <hi>and</hi> 29<hi>th. paſt, and truly I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but with great ſorrow lament the loſs of our good Friend honeſt Mr.</hi> John Wright, <hi>but with patience we muſt ſubmit to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, who can as well raiſe up Inſtruments to do his work, as change hearts, of which we have ſo great an inſtance in the buſineſs of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47162:5"/>
the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>that no Age or Hiſtory can parallel. I am now throughly ſatisfied, that what was printed in the</hi> Mondays <hi>Gazette is utterly falſe, and you will ſee it publickly declared ſo ſhortly. The King is never pleaſed but when he is with him, hath commanded all the Privy Council to wait upon him, and happy is he that hath moſt of his favour. His Pardon was ſealed and delivered to him laſt</hi> Wedneſday. <hi>'Tis ſaid he will be reſtored to be Maſter of the Horſe, and be called into the Council Table, and to all his other places, and 'tis reported he will be made Captain General of all the Forces, and Lord High Admiral, &amp;c. he treats all his old Friends that daily viſit him with great Civilities, they are all ſatisfied with his integrity, and if God ſpares his life, doubt not but he will be an Inſtrument of much good to the King' and Kingdom. He ſaid publickly, That he knew my Lord</hi> Ruſſel <hi>was as Loyal a Subject as any in</hi> England, <hi>and that His Majeſty believed the ſame now. I intend ſhortly to wait on him my ſelf. It would make you laugh to ſee how ſtrangely our High-Tories and Clergy are mortified, their Countenances ſpeak it. Were my</hi> Sheſorary <hi>to be moved for now it would be readily granted. Sr.</hi> George <hi>is grown very humble: 'Tis ſaid Mr.</hi> Sidney <hi>is reprieved for</hi> 40 <hi>dayes, which bodes well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then, Gentlemen, he goes on further, and in a third Letter ſayes,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The late change here in publick affairs is ſo great and ſtrange, that we are like men in a dream, can hardly believe what we ſee, and fear we are not fit for ſo great a mercy as the preſent juncture ſeems to promiſe. The Sham Proteſtant-Plot is quite loſt and confounded. The Earl of</hi> Mackensfield <hi>is bringing Actions of</hi> Scandalis Magnatum <hi>againſt all the Grand Jury-men that indicted him at laſt Aſſizes.</hi>

                  <hi>Contrary to all mens expectations, a Warrant is ſigned at laſt for beheading Col.</hi> Sidney <hi>at</hi> Tower-Hill <hi>next</hi> Friday. <hi>Great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours have been uſed to obtain his Pardon, but the contrary Party have carried it, which much daſheth our hopes, but God ſtill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Gentlemen, all this the Information ſaies, he has done againſt the peace of the King, his Crown and Dignity. To this he has pleaded Not Guilty. We will call our Witneſſes, and if we prove it, we queſtion not but you will find him Guilty.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip and you Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Jury; I am of Counſel for the King in this cauſe. Upon the opening of theſe Letters to you, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but wonder much more than he does that wrote them. His matter of wonder was one way, and I ſuppoſe your matter of wonder is another way, that a man, ſuch an one as he is, ſhould have that confidence to write ſuch Letters as theſe are. Gentlemen, I do not doubt but you obſerve in the Series of theſe Letters how he hath travelled through all the tranſactions of this horrid Conſpiracy, that was of late con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived againſt the life of the King, and the life of his Royal Highneſs, and for the deſtruction of the Government; and how he does endeavour to turn it all into ridicule, and to magnifie the men, that have come to publick Juſtice for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerned in that horrid Conſpiracy, as being very brave men. The brave Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> he is lamented as a brave man loſt; The Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> he forſooth was murthered, and Mr. <hi>Bradden</hi> who proſecuted that murther, he is a brave man, whom I ſuppoſe ſome of you have heard of, and what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of him, how he is convicted of one of the moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Facts that ever was acted by man in any Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was that <hi>Bradden</hi> ſhould go up and down to get witneſſes to make it appear to the World, as though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body had murthered that Earl. Thus you ſee he goes through the Conſpiracy from one thing to another, and calls it a Sham Proteſtant-Plot, and all to ridicule the diſcovery, which by theſe very Letters you may eaſily be ſatisfied of the reality and extent of. You ſee how he magnifies his <hi>Julian,</hi> but he
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:47162:6"/>
likewiſe is come to condign puniſhment for that moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and ſcandalous Libel. In the next place he comes to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and tells you what a brave man they have in him, to be their Captain General, and he did not doubt but to ſee him come to it; and ſets forth that he has denied all the Plot, and how he doth perſiſt in that denial. And this Gentleman has raiſed his confidence in theſe Letters to that degree, that I think, any man that has lived any time in this Nation, cannot but wonder, that ever there ſhould be ſuch an impudent action committed in it. Gentlemen, we ſhall call our Witneſſes and prove it poſitively upon him, that theſe Letters he did write, and then I ſuppoſe he will give an account how he came to write them.</p>

I have but one word which I deſire to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; for the opening of the Caſe, and a right underſtanding of the matter will have a great influence upon the proofs. And I ſhall not inſiſt upon any thing that has been opened at large out of the Letters, but one thing I would obſerve to you, and that is out of the laſt Letter. <hi>Great endeavours have been uſed to obtain his pardon, but the contrary Party have carried it, which much daſheth our hopes.</hi> So it ſeems by this that the Faction, the Party, have their hopes ſtill, and it ſeems likewiſe the Writer of theſe Letters, hath a very great ſhare in them. We have Gentlemen, nothing to do here before you, but to prove that Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton</hi> was the Author, Writer and Publiſher of the Letters, which contain that which is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Information, and that we queſtion not but to prove clearly without contradiction.</p>

               <p>I had no direction but to leave them where I uſed to leave his Letters, and that was in a Window that Sir <hi>Samuel Barnardiſton</hi> always left his Letters in, and from thence one of the Boys uſed to carry them to the Poſt-houſe.</p>

               <p>Sir, I am not ſo certain as to ſwear to theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Letters; but his uſual Cuſtom was, He would write a Letter, and then give it me to Copy: his Cloſet door was near another Window, and there he would leave it. If it were but one Letter, he would uſe to ſay, direct ſuch a Letter to ſuch a perſon, or ſuch a place, and when it was ſo directed, I was uſed to put my Letters there, and thence one of the Boys came and fetched them to carry them to the Poſt-houſe.

                     <p>The return of the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and his being received into extraordinary favour of His Majeſty, hath made a ſtrange alteration of Affairs at Court: For thoſe that before ſpake of him very indecently, now court, cringe, and creep to him. His Grace complained to the King of the ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous miſrepreſentation that was made of him in the <hi>Mondays Gazette,</hi> upon which the <hi>Gazetter</hi> was called to accompt for it, who alleadged for himſelf, That a Perſon of great Quality ſent him in writing the Words therein recited, commanding him to put them in the <hi>Gazette.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yeſterday being the laſt day of the Term, all the Priſoners that were in the Tower upon the late ſham Proteſtant Plot, were diſcharged upon Bail. <hi>Mr. Bradden,</hi> who proſecuted the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> the Information put in againſt him in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> by <hi>Mr. Attorney</hi> (for a pretended ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was not proſecuted, and his Bail was diſcharged. And the paſsing Sentence upon the Author of <hi>Julian the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi> and the Printer of the late Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s Speech, was paſſed over with ſilence. Great applications are made to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty for the pardoning <hi>Mr. Sidney</hi> in the Tower, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved will be attained, and that he will be baniſhed.</p>
                     <p>The Lord <hi>Howard</hi> appears deſpicable in the Eyes of all men, he is under a Guard at <hi>White-Hall,</hi> and believed he will be

I am now throughly ſatisfied, that what was Printed in the <hi>Mondays Gazette</hi> is utterly falſe, and you will ſee it publickly ſo declared ſhortly. The King is never pleaſed but when he is with him, hath commanded all the Privy Council to wait upon him, and happy is he that hath moſt of his favor. His Pardon was ſealed and delivered to him laſt Wedneſday. 'Tis ſaid, he will be reſtored to be Master of the Horſe, and be called into the Council Table, and to all his other Places· And 'tis report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he will be made Captain General of all the Forces, and Lord High Admiral, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He treats all his old Friends that daily viſit him, with great Civilities; they are all ſatisfied with his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and if God ſpares his Life, doubt not but he will be an

Inſtrument of much good to the King and Kingdom. He ſaid publickly, that he knew my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> was as Loyal a Subject as any in <hi>England,</hi> and that His Majeſty believed the ſame now.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen of the Jury, I am of Counſel here for the Defendant Sir <hi>Samuel Barnardiſton,</hi> and the queſtion now before you is, Whether this Gentleman be knowingly guilty of the writing and publiſhing theſe four Letters that have been read here to you, and which of them he is guilty of writing, and which not? I do not ſee ſee that his name is put to any of them, nay, the Letters are not ſubſcribed by any body, and that, Gentlemen; you may ſee by looking upon the Letters. For the Evidence that hath been given, I beſeech your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to obſerve what it is. As to his publiſhing of them I ſee no Evidence at all to prove him any way
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47162:12"/>
concerned in that: ſome of them indeed are his own hand writing, and proved to be his Letters, by his own confeſſion before the King and Council; that Mr. <hi>Blath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waite</hi> and Mr. <hi>Atterbury</hi> the Meſſenger ſwear directly, That Sir <hi>Samuel Barnardiſton</hi> did own the Letters, but for the fourth they ſay he did diſown that to be his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and it is not ſo much as his hand; but what proof is it they have brought to apply this to him? You ſee what a ſort of proof is made: They produce you here a young man that was (as it hapned) his Servant at this time, and lived in his Family with him in the nature of a Secretary, it ſeems; and how fit he was to be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Quality, you I queſtion not obſerve. He ſays, he did Copy this Letter by the direction of his Maſter. It is well if he did not keep a Copy himſelf by him of ſuch a Letter as this for a particular uſe, as ſome honeſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants have done before now, that have deſigned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of advantage to themſelves: But that is his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence about this fourth Letter. That then Gentlemen which we would offer on behalf of the Defendant, is this, Whether there be any Evidence of the publiſhing of theſe Letters by Sir <hi>Samuel Barnardiston,</hi> either of all or any, and which of them? All the proof that I hear, comes from <hi>Atterbury,</hi> and the Clerk of the Council <hi>Mr. Blathwaite,</hi> which is but this: <hi>Atterbury</hi> ſays, that Sir <hi>Samuel</hi> ſhould ſay, they were ſent to the Poſt-houſe; and <hi>Mr. Blathwaite</hi> ſays, he did not deny the publiſhing of them, but he does not ſay, he confeſſed it. As to the ſending to the Poſt-houſe, if it be true, I ſhall leave it to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip how far that, my Lord, can be a publiſhing of a Libel; whether that be a publiſhing within the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or no? A Gentleman writes a Letter to a private Friend, and ſends it to the Poſt-houſe; whether that be a publiſhing of a Libel, I leave it to you? For the fourth Letter, this ſame truſty Secretary cannot tell you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he delivered it back again to Sir <hi>Samuel,</hi> or no; or whether he put it in the window; or whether he delivered it in at the Poſt-houſe, only, as he believes, he laid it in the window as he uſed to do other Letters. But whatever he believes muſt not paſs for Evidence, eſpecially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rs
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47162:12"/>
of this nature, it being a great Crime, as the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation has ſet it forth. If then there is no proof (as with ſubmiſſion I hope there is not) of the publication of theſe Letters, I ſuppoſe, Gentlemen, you will not take it upon your Oaths, that he is Guilty of what he is here accuſed of without Evidence. This Information, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, doth mention ſeveral things which do very much aggravate the matter, if they were proved. Many things are laid in it to induce the Information, and which may much enhance the Crime, but of which I ſee no manner of proof at all. Many things are mentioned as Facts leading to the main Fact, which is the great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; but theſe not being proved upon him, I deſire he may be acquitted of that part.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, there is no proof of it; or that he did do it with a Deſign ſeditiouſly to diſturb the Peace, that he did it with a ſeditious Intent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. J.</speaker>
               <p>You would have the Jury find, I warrant, that he did it piouſly, and with a good intent.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Williams.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, there is a middle way—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. J.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, <hi>Mr. Williams,</hi> Let us have none of that Doctrine, we muſt have a care of that, and your middle ways. For certainly the Law ſupplies the proof, if the thing it ſelf ſpeaks malice and ſedition. As it is in Murder, we ſay always in the Indictment, He did it by the Inſtigation of the Devil: Can the Jury, if they find the Fact, find he did it not by ſuch Inſtigation? No, that does neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily attend the very nature of ſuch an action, or thing. So, in Informations for Offences of this nature, we ſay, He did it falſly, malitiouſly, and ſeditiouſly, which are the formal words; but, If the nature of the thing be ſuch as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily imports malice, reproach, and ſcandal to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, there needs no proof but of the Fact done,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47162:13"/>
the Law ſupplies the reſt. If the Fact were indifferent in it ſelf, then to make a Crime of it, the accidental Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances muſt be proved, but it needs not where the thing implies malice in its own nature. You would have the Jury find he had no ill Deſign in it; he did it with a good intent, I warrant you.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. J.</speaker>
               <p>Do you think he did it to ſerve the Crown? If the Jury will take it upon their Oaths that Sir <hi>Samuel Barnardiston</hi> wrote theſe Letters to ſerve the Crown, you ſay ſomething. Pray ask them that Queſtion: Try if you can make them believe that, <hi>Mr. Williams.</hi>

               <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, Here is an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation exhibited againſt Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſets forth this matter. It doth take notice of a horrid Conſpiracy, a damnable Conſpiracy, lately hatched and ſet on foot for the Deſtruction of the King, and for the Subverſion of the Government, That there were divers Perſons who were Indicted, and ſtood Convicted, and were afterwards Executed for this horrid Conſpiracy. Among the reſt, there is notice taken of my Lord <hi>Ruſſel</hi> for one, and Colonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> (he went by that name, <hi>Algernon Sidney</hi> I mean) for another, to be two of thoſe Conſpirators that were ingaged in that damnable Conſpiracy for the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the King, and Subverſion of the Government.</p>
               <p>Now Gentlemen, That theſe Perſons according to the inducement of this Information, were ſo Indicted, ſo Attaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Executed (as far forth as is recited in the Information) is proved to you by the two Records, which the Counſel on the other ſide inſiſted to have ſhewn, and which have been now produced. The one is ſworn to be a true Copy of the Conviction and Attainder of my Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and the other which they produced was the Record it ſelf of the Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Attainder of <hi>Sidney.</hi> So that, as to that part it is plain,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47162:14"/>
they were Convicted and Attainted, both the one and the other, as Actors in that Helliſh Plot.</p>
               <p>The next thing, Gentlemen, and which was ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon by the Defendants Counſel, is this: The Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation takes notice that the Defendant Sir <hi>Samuel Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſton,</hi> being a man of a Factious, Seditious, Diſaffected temper towards the Government, a man of ill Principles, in order to diſturb, diſquiet, and diſcompoſe the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he did cauſe ſeveral Letters, Four in Number, to be Writ and Publiſhed, which Letters have been read unto you.</p>
               <p>It hath been objected, That in as much as the words, Falſly, Seditiouſly, Malitiouſly, Factiouſly, and the like words are in the Information, they would have you believe, That there being no Evidence of any ſuch thing, as Faction, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Sedition, or that the man did it Malitiouſly, and Adviſedly and Seditiouſly (which are the words in the Premiſes, as I may call them, or the Preamble of the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) therefore they muſt be acquitted of that part. Now as to that, I told them then, and tell you now, Gentlemen, That no man living can diſcover the malitious evil Deſigns and Intentions of any other man, ſo as to give Evidence of them, but by their words and actions. No man can prove what I intend, but by my words and actions. Therefore if one doth compaſs and imagine the death of the King, that by our Law, is High Treaſon; but whether or no he be guilty of this Treaſon, ſo as to be convicted of it by another, is not proveable, or diſcoverable, but by ſome words or acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby the imagination may be manifeſted. And therefore my imagining, my compaſſing, which is private in my own mind, muſt be ſubmitted to the Judgment that Reaſon and the Law paſſeth upon my words or actions, and then the action it ſelf being proved, that diſcovers with what mind the thing was done; as in the Caſe I put before to the Counſel. Suppoſe any man without provocation kill another, the words of the Indictment are, That he did it Malitiouſly, Feloniouſly, not having the fear of God before his eyes, but being moved and ſeduced by the inſtigation of the Devil. Now all theſe things, whether he had the fear of God before his eyes, or not; or whether he were moved by the inſtigation of the Devil, and of his Malice fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47162:15"/>
or no; theſe cannot be known, till they come to be proved by the action that is done.</p>
               <p>So that in caſe any Perſon doth write Libels, or publiſh any expreſſions which in themſelves carry Sedition and Faction, and ill will towards the Government; I cannot tell well how to expreſs it otherwiſe in his Accuſation, than by ſuch words, that he did it Seditiouſly, Factiouſly, and Malitiouſly. And the proof of the thing it ſelf, proves the evil mind it was done with. If then, Gentlemen, You believe the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton,</hi> did write and publiſh theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that is proof enough of the words, Malitiouſly, Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly, and Factiouſly, laid in the Information.</p>
               <p>The Letters are Factious, Seditious, and Malitious Letters, and as baſe as the worſt of Mankind (though he had had all the Provocation that ever could be given a man to Libel another) could ever have invented. And let Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton</hi> put it under the Countenance, or under the Umbrage, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Enamel of his Zeal for the true Proteſtant Religion, if he will; or if he have a mind to it, to give himſelf any fine Name, by calling himſelf one of the Sober Party, or the Godly Party, or the Upright Party; let him gild him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and paint himſelf as he pleaſeth, yet the inſide is Rotten, and 'tis Factious and Seditious at the bottom to all intents and purpoſes whatſoever. And if he be Guilty of it, as you Gentlemen are to Try and Conſider, the greater the Man is, the greater the Crime, and the more Underſtanding he has, the more Malitious he ſeems to be: For your little ordinary ſort of People, that are of common mean underſtanding, they may be wheedled and drawn in, and ſurprized into ſuch things; but Men of a publick Figure, and of ſome Value in the world, that have been taken to be Men of the greateſt Intereſt and Reputation in a Party, it cannot be thought a ſudden ſurprize upon them, no 'tis a work of time and thought, 'tis a thing fixed in his very Nature, and it ſhews ſo much venome, as would make one think the whole Maſs of his Blood were corrupted. I had thought the Act of Oblivion might have put Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton</hi> in mind, That it was not fit any more to go down to <hi>White-Hall,</hi> to make Uproars, and Tumults, and Hubbub's.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:47162:15"/>But here is the matter that he now is accuſed of, and here is in it malice againſt the King, malice againſt the Government, malice againſt both Church and State, malice againſt any Man that bears any ſhare in the Government, indeed malice againſt all Mankind that are not of the ſame perſwaſion with thoſe bloody Miſcreants, (I cannot give them a milder Name) I mean the Conſpirators in the late damnable Conſpiracy, ſome of whom have been Attainted and Executed for it. Here is the Sanctifying of Traitors, that were juſtly Sentenced to Execution according to the Law of the Land, and at the ſame time there is joyned with it the moſt inveterate Inſinuation againſt the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that can be, as though the King was prevailed with upon a <hi>ſham Proteſtant Plot,</hi> to do things in order to deſtroy the Government it ſelf, and every one of the <hi>Sober Party,</hi> as they call themſelves. For theſe perſons could not have ſuffered, but as Condemned according to the Rules of Law, but theſe Letters carry an Inſinuation as if they were cut off by a Sham-Trick and deſign. For after the good News of the Reprieve of <hi>Sidney</hi> was contradicted, the Warrant for his Execution is taken notice of, and you ſee the manner of expreſſion that is uſed, <hi>their Party has prevailed,</hi> as though the putting the Laws in Execution, and Hanging of Traitors, were ſuch a thing, that a Party muſt be ſet up to prevail to do it, and Mankind muſt be divided into Parties, their Party and our Party, and the contrary Party, they have prevailed, and truly now our Party, the <hi>Sober Party,</hi> as he calls it, are in a very ſad condition.</p>
               <p>Then here is, as I ſaid, the Sainting of Two horrid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators; here is the <hi>L. Ruſſel</hi> Sainted, that bleſſed Martyr, my <hi>L. Ruſſel,</hi> that good Man, that excellent Proteſtant, he is lamented, and what an extraordinary Man he was, who was fairly Tryed, and juſtly Convicted and Attainted, for having a hand in this horrid Conſpiracy againſt the Life of the <hi>KING,</hi> and his deareſt Brother His ROYAL HIGHNESS, and for the ſubverſion of the Government. And here is Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> Sainted, what an extraordinary Man he was? yes ſurely, he was a very good Man, becauſe you may ſome of you remember, or have read the Hiſtory of thoſe times,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:47162:16"/>
and know what ſhare Mr. <hi>Sidney</hi> had in that black and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Villany, that curſed Treaſon and Murder, the Murder I mean of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of Bleſſed Memory, a ſhame to Religion it ſelf, a perpetual reproach to the Iſland we live in, to think that a Prince ſhould be brought by pretended Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Law and Juſtice to ſuch an end at his own Palace. And 'tis a ſhame to think, that ſuch bloody Miſcreants ſhould be Sainted and lamented, who had any hand in that horrid Murder and Treaſon, and who to their dying Minutes, when they were upon the brink of Eternity, and juſt ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into another world, could confidently bleſs God for their being ingaged in that <hi>Good Cauſe,</hi> (as they call it) which was the Rebellion, which brought that Bleſſed Martyr to His Death. It is high time for all Mankind, that have any Chriſtianity or ſenſe of Heaven or Hell, to beſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to rid the Nation of ſuch Caterpillars, ſuch Monſters of Villany as theſe are.</p>
               <p>Nay, In theſe very Letters is contained the very Language of that curſed Murderer and Traitor <hi>Walcot</hi> himſelf, <hi>That God Almighty in his own time would raiſe up Inſtruments.</hi> I know, Gentlemen, you have heard and read what that bloody Traitor ſaid to that effect; and you hear what expreſſions like it are in theſe Letters, <hi>I am ſorry for the death of our friend, honeſt Mr.</hi> John Wright, <hi>but God can eaſily raiſe up Inſtruments to do his own work</hi>; the very Language of <hi>Walcot.</hi> And I would have you take notice of it Mr. <hi>Blackerby,</hi> for I would have you take warning by theſe things.</p>

            <p>Speaking to a Gentleman that was taking Notes.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lord Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>Theſe Letters tell you, <hi>God will be ſure to raiſe up Inſtruments,</hi> but what Inſtruments do they mean? Inſtruments of Rebellion, and Faction, and Sedition, which they moſt falſly call, <hi>his own work.</hi> For it is that Monſtrous Sin Rebellion that they mean by it, Inſtruments of Treaſon, under pretence of fighting for God Almighty they would fain be fighting againſt the Government. It was the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the former times, wherewith they deſtroyed the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47162:16"/>
beſt of Kings, and ſubverted the beſt of Governments for a time, and were very near having totally deſtroyed three Kingdoms, under pretence of doing God good ſervice. And when once a People purſue ſuch Principles, and under the pretence of Religion, endeavour to deſtroy Monarchy and Government it ſelf, it is high time for all honeſt men to look about them.</p>
               <p>Nay, and you may obſerve, Gentlemen, another thing in theſe Letters, it is not only the deſtruction of the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the King and thoſe that are in Authority near Him that are aimed at, but all Perſons that come with humble Repreſentations of their Loyalty to Him, all that Addreſs themſelves to the King to ſhew their Duty, and their diſlike of that damnable Deſign and Conſpiracy againſt Him. <hi>For now</hi> (ſays Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton) all the Sham Plot is quite blown off, and we cannot find any here, 'tis loſt except you can find it among the Addreſſers and Abhorrers in the Countrey, or among a parcel of Clergy-men.</hi>—So that all Mankind, that ever thought themſelves obliged to congratulate that bleſſed and happy Deliverance, either to own our Thankfulneſs to God for it, to whom we owe more than we are able to pay for his great Mercy to us therein, or to expreſs our Joy to the King, in humble Addreſſes, Congratulating His Deliverance from the horrid Conſpiracy lately deſigned againſt Him, His Brother, and the Government; theſe Gentlemen, becauſe they are Loyal Subjects, and deſire to ſhew themſelves ſo, muſt be branded with the Names of <hi>Abhorrers, Torys, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſers, Sham-Plotters,</hi> and all the Ignominy they can lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. This ſhews it was not only aimed at the Civil Magiſtracy, but at all that dare be honeſt and oppoſe Faction and Rebellion.</p>
               <p>As for any thing that he has ſaid of me, Sir <hi>Samuel Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſton</hi> ſhall write and ſpeak of me as long as he pleaſes. But though he ſays, <hi>I am down in the mouth;</hi> it is true, I have a little loſt my Tongue by my cold, yet I hope I ſhall never loſe my Heart nor Spirit to ſerve the Government, nor forbear to uſe my utmoſt diligence to ſee that ſuch Offenders as theſe Perſons, that entertain Principles ſo deſtructive to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, be brought to condign puniſhment. And be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47162:17"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> the queſtion before you is, whether the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant be guilty of Writing theſe Malicious, Seditious Letters; for that they are Malicious and Factious, no honeſt Man can doubt in the leaſt, and I do not find that the Counſell for the Defendant do offer to ſay any thing in defence of the Letters, or can ſay, but that they are as venomous Malicious, Seditious, Factious, Tumultuous Letters as can be Written, and I muſt tell you, tread very near upon the Borders of High Treaſon it ſelf. I am ſure I may venture to call it <hi>Cozen German</hi> to <hi>High Treaſon.</hi>

               <p>Now that he did Write and publiſh them, you have this proof before you: Mr. <hi>Blathwaite</hi> tells you, That Sir <hi>Samuel</hi> did own three of them, acknowledge them to be his own Writing before His Sacred Majeſty in Council. <hi>Atterbury</hi> the Meſſenger ſays, he was by too when he did before the King acknowledge the Writing of thoſe Three Letters. As to the Superſcription to one of thoſe Three Letters, you have the teſtimony of <hi>Oſland,</hi> the young Man that lived with Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton,</hi> he Swears he Writ it by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, being his Servant. And as to the Fourth Letter, this young Man does directly ſwear, that the Original he Copied it by (for it is his Writing) he had from Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton,</hi> and 'twas of Sir <hi>Samuel's</hi> own Writing, (which he knows well, being acquainted with his Hand) and that Sir <hi>Samuel</hi> expreſly directed him to Copy it out, which he did by his Command, and this is the ſame Letter; and ſo though 'tis not under his hand, yet it is under his Mans, and Written by his direction. And he ſays he does believe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Three to be his Hand-Writing. So as to the Dictating and Writing of theſe Letters, you have as full and as plain a proof as can be made.</p>
               <p>And as to his Publiſhing of them, which is another part of the Information, and of which Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaid there was no proof, I would ſay but this to you. Is it not very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous, abſurd and ſenſleſs, to think that ever it ſhould enter into any Mans imagination, that Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton</hi>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:47162:17"/>
would take ſuch a wonderful deal of pains and care to Write theſe Letters to Sir <hi>Philip Skippon,</hi> and to the other Two Men, to tell them of his endeavours to take off Mr. <hi>Kedders</hi> ſcruples, and perſwade him to go down to <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> and to deſire them to <hi>take care</hi> of the <hi>Sober Party,</hi> and endeavour to get <hi>Sober Men</hi> into play, and <hi>all will do well,</hi> and that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> had <hi>denyed</hi> all the Plot, and ſo given the lye to the King and the Courts of Juſtice, and now there was a door opened for <hi>Sober Men</hi> to come in, and God would <hi>raiſe up Inſtruments,</hi> and the <hi>Sober Party</hi> will up again. Do you think, I ſay, he would Write all this Fuſtian ſtuff, (for I can call it no better than ſtuff, though it be very malicious ſtuff) and carry to his Man to Copy out, and Superſcribe them and Seal them, only to put them in his Pocket? If you can believe this, upon my word you have a Faith able to remove great Mountains; but I aſſure you my Faith cannot get to that ſtrength.</p>
               <p>But for further Proof of the publiſhing, you hear what the young man that was the Defendants Servant ſays. He tlles you the uſual way of dealing with Sir <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Letters was this, There was a Window near Sir <hi>Samuel</hi>'s Cloſet, and when the Letters were Sealed up, they were uſed to be put there in order that the Boy according to the uſual courſe might carry them to the Poſt-Houſe. And he doth believe theſe Letters (though he cannot Particularly and Poſitively ſpeak to them) were ſo uſed.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, you have it by <hi>Atterbury</hi> Poſitively Sworn, that about the ſame time that Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton</hi> did acknowledge before the King, that he Writ thoſe Letters, being in his Cuſtody, he did ſay they were ſent to the Poſt-houſe, and he wondred how they came by 'em. That proves it was done by his privity. And beyond all there is this Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that the thing ſpeaks it ſelf, they are directed to Men at <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> where Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton</hi> is known to have a correſpondence, they take notice of the receipt of Letters from thence, and of the Death of Mr. <hi>Wright,</hi> mentioned in thoſe Letters, which ſhews them to be Anſwers to Letters received, and muſt not theſe think you be ſent, but kept ſtill in his Pocket? There is notice alſo taken in them,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47162:18"/>
of their Country affairs: Though they ſeemed to have met with ſome diſappointment in ſuch a buſineſs about Mr. <hi>Kedder,</hi> yet they were reſolved <hi>to go on,</hi> and deſires them to communicate this buſineſs of Mr. <hi>Kedder</hi> and Dr. <hi>Clegitt,</hi> to <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> of our <hi>friends,</hi> and deſire them to <hi>beſtir</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and get in <hi>Sober Men,</hi> ſuch as Mr. <hi>Kedder</hi> among them. For it is mightily for our <hi>advantage,</hi> that there ſhould be <hi>Sober Men</hi> brought into play at <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> and pray be <hi>ſure</hi> to keep the <hi>Sober Party</hi> up. Theſe things in their own nature ſpeak, that theſe Letters were intended and Written, in order to preſerve a correſpondence between thoſe of the <hi>Sober Party</hi> in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> and their friends here, and therefore you may eaſily conclude what was to be done with them.</p>
               <p>So that, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> this Information ſurely (if ever any was) is fully proved, as it is laid in all the parts of it.</p>
               <p>I would not have given you ſo much trouble at this time in an Affair of this Nature, that has been ſo evidently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, becauſe your Queſtion that you are to Try, is only, Whether the Defendant be Guilty of this Offence, or not Guilty? (You are not to inflict the Penalty, that is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the Court above;) but only becauſe I ſee it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great Expectation and Conſequence. I would not we ſhould be gulled twice in one Age, by the ſelf-ſame Men, and the ſelf-ſame Way, into the ſame Treaſon and Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and all thoſe other Miſchiefs, that dreadful Chaos and State of Confuſion, Miſery and Deſtruction, that we were brought into in the late Times. And that has made me take ſo much notice now in this Place of the Tendency of Things of this Nature, that we may learn to beware of, and know theſe Men that carry Sheeps cloathing, pretend Zeal and Religion, but their Inſides are Wolves. They are Traitors in their Minds, whatſoever they are in their outward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then the Jury laid their Heads together in the place where they ſtood, and being preſently after agreed upon their Verdict, the Foreman gave it in,</p>
            <p>That the Defendant Sir <hi>Samuel Bernardiſton</hi> was Guilty of the Offence and Miſdemeanour Charged on him by the Information.</p>
            <p>Which Verdict was Recorded by the Clerk.</p>
