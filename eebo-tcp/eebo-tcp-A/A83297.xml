            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ORDINANCE OF THE LORDS and COMMONS aſsembled in PARLIAMENT, Inhibiting the importation of CURRANS.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas it is found by daily experience, that the Importation of Currans into this Kingdome (it being a Commodity of little or no uſe at all, but a meere ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity, and may well bee ſpared) is a matter of great concernment, not only to the Merchant, but to this Nation, in regard the ſaid Commodity cannot be had in the parts beyond the Seas, where the ſame are bought, without ready money, an hundred thouſand pound <hi>per annum</hi> at leaſt being beſtowed in Currans, which otherwiſe would be brought into this Kingdome, is wholly diverted; whereas formerly (till of later yeares) the ſaid Currans were bought for Commodities of this Kingdome, exported hence of ſmall value, beſides the great advantage which is yearly made upon the Merchant (where the ſaid Currans are laden) to their exceeding prejudice by the high and exceſſive Rates and Taxes which are there impoſed upon the ſaid Commodity.</p>
            <p>For the prevention of the like miſchiefe for time to come, the Lords and Commons in this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſembled, at the inſtance and deſire of the Merchants of this Kingdome, and by and with their conſent, doe order, ordaine, and declare, that from and after the laſt day of September, which ſhall be in the yeare of our Lord God 1642, That no Currans be imported into the Kingdome of England, or Dominion of Wales, by any Merchants ſtrangers, Denizens, or others by way of Merchandize or otherwiſe, from any parts beyond the Seas; But the importation thereof from and after the ſaid laſt day of September, is hereby utterly prohibited and forbidden.</p>
            <p>And further by the Authority aforeſaid, it is ordered and declared, That from and after the ſaid laſt day of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, no Entries be taken of any Currans that ſhall be imported into this Kingdom or Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> by any Officer whatſoever, in any of the Cuſtome-Houſes or elſewhere; And in caſe any Merchant Denizen, or Alien, or any other perſon whatſoever contrary to this Ordinance, ſhall preſume to Import and unlade any Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans within this Kingdome or Dominion of <hi>Wales</hi> after the ſaid laſt day of September, that it ſhall be lawfull for the Officers of the Cuſtome-Houſe reſpectively, to ſeize, take, and carry away all ſuch Currans, and them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine untill they ſhall receive further order from both the Houſes of Parliament in that behalfe; And that every perſon that ſhall offend herein, ſhall be liable to ſuch further puniſhment and cenſure as the Lords and Commons in a Parliamentary way ſhall inflict or impoſe.</p>
            <p>And it is further ordered that the reſpective Officers of the Cuſtome-houſes doe take ſpeciall care to put this Ordinance in execution, or doe cauſe it to be fully executed in every point according to the true intention of the ſame, and that ſuch perſons as ſhall not obey in any of the premiſes ſhall anſwer their neglect and contempt before the Lords and Commons in Parliament, and not otherwiſe or elſewhere.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, it is ordered and declared, That from and after the three and twentieth day of Auguſt, which ſhall be in the yeere of our Lord God, 1642. that no Currans which are already bought in the parts beyond the Seas, and brought into this Kingdome or the Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> ſhall be ſold by retaile for more than after the rate of five pence the pound, and that if any perſon (that ſhall ſell the ſame) ſhall offend contrary to this Ordinance, that he ſhall be liable to receive ſuch puniſhment as the Lords and Commons in a Parliamentary way ſhall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for his contempt in that behalfe.</p>
