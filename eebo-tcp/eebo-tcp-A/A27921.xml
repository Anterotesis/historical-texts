         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE preſumption of this Dedication
was firſt taken from that Religious
and Honourable Character, which
Your Piety and Moderation have made fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
and celebrated among Godly Men of

That the ſhelter of Your Honour's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
would not only be a ſufficient Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for this well-deſigned Work, from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
reflections may happen to be caſt againſt
it; but would alſo introduce the much more
general acceptance of it to multitudes of well-diſpoſed
people.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, that Your Condeſcenſion
hath been ſo great, in ſtooping to peruſe the
<hi>Preface,</hi> and inſpect the Work; and after all,
That Your Wiſdom hath crowned it with
Your Approbation and Countenance, and alſo
vouchſafed that generous Grant, of permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Your Honourable Name to be prefixed
in the <hi>Front</hi> of it; the Eyes of thoſe who
are truly vertuous, will have a regard an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable

thereby to purſue the footſteps of a Precedent
ſo highly Noble, and univerſally Renowned.</p>
            <p>Sir, Complements are things beneath the

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN this Preface I purpoſe Two things; Firſt, To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the ſinging of Pſalms, from its Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and the Examples, and Commands of Holy
men, and from its profitableneſs to thoſe that ſing
with the heart and with underſtanding: And ſecondly,
To give plain directions, whereby perſons that can but
read, may be (quickly) able to ſing true, by peruſing
them a few times over, and practiſing the ſame at
Churches, and at vacant opportunities.</p>
            <p>The firſt Maſter of Muſick, recorded in Scripture,
was <hi>Jubal, Gen.</hi> 4. 21. long before <hi>Noah;</hi> but <hi>Moſes</hi>
(who gives us the account of him) is brief in his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of things in times before his own, eſpecially of thoſe
before the Flood, or elſe we might have (perhaps) had
many other inſtances. Songs alſo were uſed in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s
time, as appears <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 27. The Iſraelites, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.
17. ſang for joy of being delivered from periſhing by
thriſt. <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak, Judg.</hi> 5. 1. ſang at the
Conqueſt of <hi>Siſera:</hi> Theſe were before King <hi>David,</hi>
whereby we ſee he was not the Inventer of this vocal
ſort of Sacrifice, or if he had been ſo, <hi>a man after God's
own heart,</hi> 1 Sam. 13. 14. and <hi>of a heart perfect with the
Lord,</hi> 1 King. 15. 3. were an Author worthy to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the uſe thereof unto us.</p>
            <p>The Wiſeſt of wiſe men hath left us the Song of
Songs of his own compiling, <hi>viz.</hi> the Book called, <hi>The
Song of Solomon;</hi> and we are informed of a thouſand
and five Songs that he made, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 4. 32. which (are
<pb facs="tcp:95001:6"/>
concluded) were loſt in the Babylonian Captivity. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> commanded ſinging to the Lord in the
words of his holy Predeceſſour <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 30.
The people which came back to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with <hi>Zerub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi>
from their ſlavery in <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſang for joy of their
return, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 12. 43. The ſucceeding Prophets do
approve and practiſe the ſame, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 1. and in many
other places of that Book; and <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 7, &amp;c. and
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 27. 25, &amp;c. in divers places of both thoſe Books;
and <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Zach.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 1.</p>
            <p>And leſt any ſhould imagine <hi>Chriſt</hi> to have diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that ancient and pious cuſtom of Songs to God, ſee
the Example of himſelf, <hi>Matt.</hi> 26. 30. None can ſay
how often he did ſo, becauſe our Records have only a
few fragments of his actions, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21. 25. Nor can we
ſuppoſe to have more of thoſe the Apoſtles did; yet
are there enough to let us know their continuance of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Melody both in precept and practice, <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 25. <hi>Paul.
and Silas ſang in priſon:</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 15. <hi>I will ſing with
the Spirit and underſtanding. Eph.</hi> 5. 19. and <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 16.
S. <hi>Paul</hi> bids them ſpeak in <hi>ſpiritual ſongs,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>Jam.</hi>
5. 13. commands the like.</p>
            <p>The profitableneſs and uſefulneſs of this pleaſant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
may appear alſo from the ſeveral occaſions,
whereby holy men have been prompted thereto, which
have not only been outward cauſes of joy and exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but even the greateſt ſtraits and troubles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the ſame hath been made uſe of, to comfort and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
the Soul.</p>
            <p>The Songs indeed of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of <hi>Barak,</hi> and <hi>Deborah,</hi>
&amp;c. were made upon times of publick temporal delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances,
whereto agrees the command of the Apoſtle
<hi>James, Is any merry? let him ſing Pſalms.</hi> But we find
holy and devour <hi>David</hi> apply himſelf hereto, under
both outward and inward troubles, in the ſixth and
thirteenth Pſalms, and thereby to obtain relief from
God in thoſe grievous diſtreſſes, as appears by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

<hi>God</hi> did not reject him, nor ought we to ſlight his Pſalms
on that account. We ought not to oppoſe mens vices
againſt the honour due to their vertues, leſt the major
part of the Bible come under challenge: For there we
ſee <hi>Moſes,</hi> that <hi>man of God,</hi> 1 Chron. 23. 14. as <hi>not any
Prophet like him,</hi> Deut. 34. 10. murmuring at <hi>Meribah,

<hi>Solomon</hi> an Idolater, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 33. and all the very
beſt Kings (even) of <hi>Judah,</hi> have left blemiſhes upon
their names, if we begin with <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 1. and
read their Hiſtory: Nay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> found every one of his
(very) Apoſtles tardy of unbelief, <hi>Matt.</hi> 17. 20. and
the chief of them were guilty of groſs crimes. And
if S. <hi>Paul</hi> may be born with for murthering S. <hi>Stephen,
Acts</hi> 7. 58. becauſe it was before his Converſion; yet
zealous S. <hi>Peter</hi> hath not that excuſe, who did no leſs

his (unasked) Oath of Allegiance, by which he had
(voluntarily) bound himſelf to the contrary (tho' he
ſhould die) not two hours before, as may be inferred,
and yet their laudable actions are not reflected on with
upbraidings of their failings. Neither are Mr. <hi>Marot</hi>'s
Works of Piety to be ridicul'd with the memory of his
miſcarriages in other caſes, if they were yielded to

            <p>Songs to God are recommended too much by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

and if any ſhall attempt an aſſault upon Divinity in

Champions for God, who will take up the chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
and manage the conflict: But here is not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to ſay more, than that daily Experience proves
what is writ in Metre, to be ſung, is more grateful to
mens fancies, ſooner imbib'd, makes a deeper impreſs,
and is longer retained in memory; yea, it elevates
the hearts and minds to more heightned contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and excelſe divine raptures than Proſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe are not ſlender Reaſons for its approbation,
and (no doubt) were part of the well-grounded conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations,
that have prevailed with <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi>

            <p>Some do except againſt (I ſhall not ſay altogether

but if it ſhall be deſired to have the Pſalms
tun'd to the Proſe, or the Metre alter'd, or to have
both done, by ſo many as may bear the charge of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
and printing Rules for them, there will be no
unwillingneſs to gratifie their good likings alſo.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who ſhall be deſirous to ſee more on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,

            <p>I intreat thoſe who ſhall read them, to go delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
through all of them, once or twice, before they
find any faults, or ask any queſtions, and by that time
they will ſee all the marks ſo very clearly unfolded,
as to have nothing in them abſtruſe, or uneaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
that is neceſſary to the ſinging of the Pſalms
true.</p>
            <p>I will ſpeak firſt of the <hi>Times,</hi> which are but three in
all, uſed in ſinging of Pſalms.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Time</hi> is marked thus 𝆸</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Time</hi> is marked thus 𝆹</p>
            <p>The third <hi>Time</hi> is marked thus 톹텥 or thus 톹텥</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Time</hi> 𝆸 (and which is leaſt uſed) is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>Brief,</hi> or two Times, or a double <hi>Time,</hi> being about
the duration of eight pulſes at the wriſt of a perſon
in good health and temper; and about that length of
<hi>Time</hi> muſt the ſame <hi>Tune</hi> of Voice continue unto any
Syllable which hath this <hi>Brief</hi> 𝆸 marked over it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>Time</hi> 𝆹 is called a <hi>Semibrief,</hi> or a whole
<hi>Time,</hi> and is but one half of a <hi>Brief</hi> 𝆸, and ſo holdeth
the Voice the ſpace of but four pulſes on that Syllable
which hath this mark or note over it 𝆹.</p>
            <p>The third <hi>Time</hi> 톹텥 or 톹텥 (whether the ſtrokes be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
or downwards) is called a <hi>Minim,</hi> or half a <hi>Time,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95001:8"/>
and is but one half of a <hi>Semibrief</hi> 𝆹 or whole <hi>Time,</hi> and
but one quarter or fourth part of a <hi>Brief</hi> 𝆸 or double
<hi>Time,</hi> and holdeth the Voice the ſpace but of two pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>In Summ,</p>
            <p>One <hi>Brief</hi> 𝆸 is two 𝆹 𝆹 <hi>Semibriefs,</hi>
or eight pulſes.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Semibrief</hi> 𝆹 is two 톹텥 or 톹텥
<hi>Minims,</hi> or four pulſes.</p>
            <p>One 톹텥 or 톹텥 <hi>Minim</hi> is but two
pulſes.</p>
            <p>So that one 톹텥 or 톹텥 <hi>Minim</hi> is half
of a <hi>Semibrief</hi> 𝆹, or a quarter of a
<hi>Brief</hi> 𝆸, and one <hi>Semibrief</hi> 𝆹 is half
of a <hi>Brief</hi> 𝆸, as is ſaid before.</p>
            <p>But the Clerks are ſeldom ſo exact as to keep theſe
diſtinct <hi>Times</hi> in the Churches: They do generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
but one <hi>Time,</hi> as indeed is moſt eaſie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
moſt agreeable to the capacities of the greater
number in Congregations and Families, and that is
(uſually) about a <hi>Minim</hi> and half, or three pulſes, or
three quarters of a <hi>Semibrief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it would be more muſical, and commendable to
keep the due <hi>Times</hi> alſo, which, if the Clerks and Maſters
of Families will take but a little care in, all the people
may quickly be expert at, after a ſmall practice, if
<pb facs="tcp:95001:9"/>
each Singer have but one of theſe Books in his hand.</p>
            <p>But I hold it beſt, That the Clerks do proceed in
their old faſhion, of one <hi>Time,</hi> for a while, until the
people may become acquainted with the different <hi>Times</hi>
of the <hi>Notes,</hi> and the right way of ſinging them; who
(then) will be able to follow as readily as Travellers do
their Guides; wherein alſo the Clerks muſt remember
to declare, with an audible voice, to the Congregations
when they will keep their accuſtomed one <hi>Time,</hi> or when
the proper muſical <hi>Times;</hi> and likewiſe when they will
obſerve the <hi>♭. flat,</hi> called in Muſick the <hi>fa</hi> Notes, or half
Notes, and the mark <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g> called <hi>ſharp,</hi> or when they will
omit the notice of them, which Characters <hi>♭.</hi> and <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g>
will be ſpoken of in their proper place. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the people in Congregations will confound one
another all over, not knowing which ſorts of <hi>Times</hi>
to obſerve, nor how to conform the degrees of their
Voices.</p>
            <p>This is all that is needful to be ſaid in this place, of
the <hi>Times</hi> of Voices in ſinging of Pſalms.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be ſpoken of is, the lowneſs, or
height of the Voice; of which there are eleven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
plainly demonſtrated by five Lines, upon and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
which, the Notes (aforementioned) of the <hi>Tunes</hi>
are ſet. Wherein obſerve, That the degrees of the
Voice are like unto the differences in the Sounds of
Bells, ſave that in ſinging is practiſed a twofold
contrary order to that of the Bells: For in ringing,
the ſmalleſt and moſt ſhrill Bell (which begins firſt) the
Ringers call the Treble or loweſt; and ſo the Bells go
(in their terms) upwards to the biggeſt, and moſt full
expreſſion of the Sound: But the firſt Note in ſinging
begins at the biggeſt and moſt full delivery of the Voice
next to grumbling, and ſo goes upwards to the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
and moſt ſhrill utterance of it next to ſqueaking;
<pb facs="tcp:95001:9"/>
ſo that what ſoundings the Singers call downward, the
Ringers call upward. And thus the difference between
Singers and Ringers appears to be twofold, as is ſaid
before. For one difference is in the order of their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
the other in their order of naming the degrees to
the Sounds, as is plainly ſhewed in what next follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is the loweſt, or moſt deep (and is the
biggeſt, or moſt full.) Sound, or degree of the Voice,
which is under the loweſt Line called the firſt Line.</p>
            <p>The ſecond degree of the Voice, is upon the loweſt
Line.</p>
            <p>The third degree of the Voice, is between the loweſt
Line and that Line next above it, called the ſecond Line.</p>
            <p>The fourth degree of the Voice, is upon the ſecond
Line, which is that next above the loweſt Line.</p>
            <p>The fifth degree of the Voice, is betwixt the ſecond
and third Line upwards.</p>
            <p>The ſixth degree of the Voice is upon the third, or
middle Line.</p>
            <p>The ſeventh degree of the Voice is betwixt the third
Line, and the fourth Line upward from the loweſt or
firſt Line.</p>
            <p>The eighth degree of the Voice is upon the fonrth
Line, which is next to the uppermoſt Line.</p>
            <p>The ninth degree of the Voice is betwixt the fourth
Line, and the fifth and uppermoſt Line.</p>
            <p>The tenth degree of the Voice is upon that upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Line.</p>
            <p>The eleventh, and higheſt degree of the Voice, is
above the fifth Line, and is the moſt ſhrill Note of all
in ſinging of Pſalms.</p>
            <p>Theſe Lines are figured in the two firſt Examples,
that Beginners may know the degrees of the Voice at
ſight, and learn (the more eaſily) to underſtand them.</p>
            <p>The Lines are figured at the right hand ends of
them, 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. and the degrees of the Voice are
ſet in words under the Lines, which now I come to

you ſing this Example; for thereby the eye and mind
will take both of them at once, without ſtudy or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
but after a little practice, ſuch pointing will be
left off as needleſs; for you will know to apply them
readily without any help. In this Example you muſt
give Times to your Voice, longer or ſhorter, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Notes, which will be very eaſie; becauſe
there are but two Times uſed in ſinging of Pſalms (as
is ſaid before) beſides the <hi>Brief</hi> 𝆸, which is applied
chiefly to the laſt Syllable of ſome Verſes, and to moſt

               <p>Before you begin to ſing any Pſalm, obſerve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
of the Tune; that is, what diſtance, or how many
degrees of the Voice there are from the loweſt to the
higheſt degree in the Tune you are about to ſing, that
ſo you may form your Voice to ſing the loweſt Note
without grumbling, and the higheſt Note without
ſqueaking; and obſerve well upon what Line, or in
what ſpace the firſt Note ſtands, and alſo have an eye
where the loweſt and higheſt Notes do both ſtand, that
ſo you may raiſe and fall your Voice betwixt them;
for tho' ſome perſons have ſtrong breaſts, yet there are
others, whoſe Voices will not ſo well reach the compaſs
of many Notes: As for inſtance, in the firſt Pſalm, the
firſt Note ſtands upon the firſt Line, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
degree of the Voice anſwering to the Figure 2. in
<pb facs="tcp:95001:11"/>
the former Example, and to the word <hi>[the]</hi> in the
Pſalm. The loweſt Note ſtands in the firſt ſpace, that
is, under the firſt Line, ſignifying the firſt degree of
the Voice, and is over the Figure 1. in the Example,
and over the word <hi>[in]</hi> being the ninth Syllable in the
third Line of the Pſalm-Book, which the fourth Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
doth not reach to; and the higheſt Note ſtands in
the ſpace between the fourth and fifth Line, which
ſhews the ninth degree of the Voice, and is over the
Figure 9. in the Example, and over <hi>[doth]</hi> the firſt Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
in the fourth Line of the Pſalm, ſo that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
of this Tune is nine Notes, for that both the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and higheſt Notes are incluſive in the number of the
compaſs, becauſe both of them muſt be ſung.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Pſalm hath the ſame Tune with the firſt.</p>
               <p>The third Pſalm hath the firſt Note upon the ſecond
Line, which is the fourth degree of the Voice, and is
over the Figure 4. in the Example, and belongs to the
Letter <hi>[O]</hi> in the Pſalm. The loweſt Note is under the
firſt Line, and is over the Figure 1. and over the word
<hi>[my]</hi> in the firſt Line. The higheſt Note is upon the
fourth Line, and is over the Figure 8. and over the word
<hi>[kill]</hi> in the ſecond Line, whereby the compaſs of this
Tune is eight Notes.</p>
               <p>The fourth Pſalm hath the firſt Note upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Line, and is over the Figure 4. in the Example,
and belongs to the letter <hi>[O]</hi> in the Pſalm, and alſo
there is no Note lower than it in that Pſalm, and the
higheſt Note is in the ſpace between the third and
fourth Line, as is over the Figure 7. and over the word
<hi>[call]</hi> which is the laſt Syllable in the firſt Line,
whereby the compaſs of this Tune is but four Notes;

the Notes of the degrees of the Voice theſe ſeven terms,
<hi>Vt, re, mi, fa, ſol, la, ci,</hi> as the French yet do; but now
they teach by no more than theſe four terms, <hi>Sol, la,

end of the Syſtem foregoing, that the Voice may take
the Note readily before the eye can find it at the left
hand end of the Syſtem. I come now to the letter ♭. and
the mark <hi>ſharp</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g>, which I promiſed to ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>You find the Letter ♭. in the fourth ſpace at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Tune to the firſt Pſalm, but you have
no <hi>ſharp</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g> until you come to the fourth Pſalm, where
it is put at the beginning of the Tune upon the ſecond
line: Their ſignification is only thus, that where the
ſaid letter ♭. ſtands in any ſpace, or upon any line at
the beginning of a Tune, all the Notes ſtanding in that
ſpace, or upon that line, ought to be ſung one half de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of the Voice lower than elſe they ſhould have
been; but if ♭. ſtand in any other part of the Tune,
it muſt be applied to that Note only, which it ſtands
before, and to no other Note: And on the contrary,
when the mark <hi>ſharp</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g> ſtands in any ſpace, or upon
any line, at the beginning of a Tune, all the Notes
ſtanding in that ſpace, or upon that line, ought to be
ſung one half degree of the Voice higher than elſe they
ſhould have been; but if the mark <hi>ſharp</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g> ſtands in
any other part of the Tune, it muſt be applied only to
the raiſing that Note which ſtands next after it, one
half degree of the Voice, and to no other Note.</p>
               <p>By this means the compaſs of the Tune of the firſt
and ſecond Pſalms will be no more than eight Notes and
half, and the compaſs of the Tune of the third Pſalm
<pb facs="tcp:95001:14"/>
will be but ſeven Notes and half, becauſe the letter ♭
hath fallen both thoſe Tunes half a Note; and alſo the
compaſs of the Tune of the fourth Pſalm will be found
but three Notes and half, becauſe the mark <g ref="char:sharp2">♯</g> doth
raiſe the loweſt degree of the Voice in that Tune half
a Note.</p>
               <p>Moſt of the Pſalms have this mark or letter 𝇍 with
