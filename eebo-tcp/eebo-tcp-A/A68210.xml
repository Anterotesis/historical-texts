         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is to be beloued of all men. Howbeit sometimes goodlie promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are meere formal, and great offers serue onely to hoodwinke
such as meane well. And as by a faire shew of <hi>wishing well,</hi> our
first parents were fowlie deceaued: so is there a cunning framed
method, by excellencie of wordes, &amp; intising speeches of mans
wisedome, to beguile and bewitch the verie Church of GOD.
And such as are vsed for this purpose come in sheepes clothing.
For he translateth him self into an Angel of light, who blindeth
all men with vtter darknes. When wee therefore, your louing

liues for Gods glorie: and the honour of our Queene) hauing so
goodlie a champion to offer combat in our defence, were made
verie secure, and by the sweete sounde of your melodious stile,
almost cast into a dreaming sleepe: Wee happelie remembring
your Preface that there might bee some <hi>other cause,</hi> opened at
the length our heauie eyes, and casting some more earnest and
intentiue sight into your manner of fight, it seemed vnto vs that
couertlie and vnderhand you did bende all your skill and force
against the present state of our English church: and by colour of
defending the discipline and gouuernement thereof, to make
questionable and bring in contempt the doctrine and faith it
selfe. For we saw the theme and the cause you haue in hand, to
be notable simples, whereof a skilfull popishe Apoticarie can
readilie make some fine potion or sweete smelling ointment, to
bring heedlesse men into the pleasant dreame of <hi>well-weening:</hi>
while they closelie set on fire the house of God. And may wee
not trulie say, that vnder the shewe of inveighing against Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanes,
the chiefest pointes of popish blasphemie, are many times
and in many places, by diuers men not obscurelie broached;
both in Sermons and in Writing: to the great griefe of manie
faithfull subiectes, who pray for the blessed and peaceable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of her most gracious Maiestie, and of the estate of the
Church of IESVS Christ; as it is nowe established among vs.
And verelie such a thing offered it selfe vnto our eyes, in reading
your bookes, and we had not skill howe to iudge otherwise; of
the handling of your penne and of the scope of your matter.
Notwithstanding because rash iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may preiudice honest
trauailes, and faithfull labourers may haue their vnaduised
slippes, and we could not tell howe zeale, loue, or glorie might
carie a man of such towardlie and excellent giftes, in the firste
shewing of him selfe to the worlde; or that an earnest striuing &amp;
bending your selfe in heate of disputation against the one side,
might dazell your eyes, and drawe your hande at vnawares to
farre and too fauourable to the other side; or else peradventure
we might mistake your meaning, and so wee should doe you
wrong against our willes. We thought it therefore our parte, in
regarde of our dutie to the Church; and most agreeing to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7977:3"/>
both for your credit and our ease; in all christian loue to
intreat you, that as you te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der the good estate of Christes church
among vs, and of thousands co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted to the gospel, you would
in like publike manner (but plainly and directlie) shew vnto vs
and all English Protestantes, your owne true meaning, and how
your wordes in diuers thinges doe agree with the doctrine esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
among vs. And that not onelie for avoyding of offence
giuen to many godlie and religious Christians: but also that the
Atheistes, Papistes, and other hereticques, be not incouraged by
your so harde and so harsh stile (beating as it were, as we verilie
thinke, against the verie heart of all true christian doctrine, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
by her Maiestie and the whole state of this Realme) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
and set light, by her sacred Maiestie, the reverend Fathers
of our Church and the whole cause of our religion. Wee haue
made choyce therefore of a few principal things, which trouble
manie godlie minded christians, who aduisedlie read ouer your
bookes, that by the sincere answering and vpright clearinge of
them, you might satisfie vs all, both in them and in all the rest,
and free your selfe from all suspition of falshoode or treacherie,
and make vs able to giue a reason of defence vnto all such as
stumble at your writinges. And for your better ease herein, and
our more readie satisfaction, we haue compared your positions
and assertions in your long discourses, vnto the articles of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

you are all one in iudgement with the church of Englande, and
that your such speaches wherewith your godly brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,

               <hi>Although
we cannot bee free from all sinne collectiuelie in such sorte, that no

one by one, both may and ought to be by all meanes auoyded. So
that in this sense to be preserued from all sinne, is not impossible.</hi>
Heere we demaunde to be informed, that if all offende in manie
things, and to say otherwise be a lye, as our English creede affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth,
how your saying can be true, that it is possible to avoyde
all great and greeuous sinnes. And what manie things they bee
whereof the scripture speaketh: Whether it meaneth not actual
offences, great and greeuous; but that some may be excepted in
regard of great sinnes: or whether you meane, that it is possible
for all christians to be preserued from all great sinnes: and if so,
why should it not bee as possible; from all small offences: and if
from small and great, why doe we not keepe our robe pure and
without spot vntill the comming of Christ, and so bee iustified
more and more by our works, as the popish Cannons teach: but
pray by Christes commaundement euery day, <hi>Forgiue vs our
trespasses.</hi>

haue mayne partes of christian trueth wherein they constantlie

errour and defection of the church of <hi>Rome</hi> foreshewed in the

them with Atheistes. seeing it is nowe made manifest to the
world, that they are departed from the doctrine of Christ &amp; his

them to be of the familie of Iesus Christ, and to be helde
and reputed a parte of the house of God, and a limme of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
church of Christ. And therefore you are bolde to affirme,
that we seuer not our selues from the church we were of before:
In the Church we were &amp; we are so still. We are here in a streight
except you helpe vs out. For if we beleeue you, we must thinke
our reverend Fathers to haue misledd vs all this while; either of
malice, or ignorance; if wee beleeue them we must thinke that
Mai. <hi>Hoo.</hi> is verie arrogant and presumptuous to make him self
the onelie Rabbi. We pray you therefore to reconcile these two
iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that men fall not away to looke back into Egypt, or
else explane your minde further, &amp; shew vs some cleere demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of that you intende; whether you be not sorrie that wee
are departed from the vnitie of that Sea, or that you thinke they
erre not in matters of faith; &amp; that all these great disputes about
the church and bloodie dissentions and conflicts come by ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
and too great zeale, and for want of knowledge in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Fathers, &amp; in all those millions of learned men, that haue
franklie giuen their blood for the detection and departing from
that church, as from Antichrist and an Apostata. And heere wee
pray you to shew vs out of divine trueth, your rule to discerne a
Congregation to bee a member of the visible Church: whether
whosoeuer holdeth anie one professeth trueth differing from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie,
may be reputed a member of the visible church, and
whether you meane by infidelitie, nothing els but that which is
not taught by the gospell of Iesus Christ, and they which holde
anie part of that which you call supernaturall trueth (that is, as
we take it, of that trueth which men know no otherwise but by
the worde of God) they are not fallen into an Apostasie, &amp;c. And
heere we craue your iudgement of the Turke, how your rule fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7977:11"/>
them. For as wee thinke by reading his Alcoran, hee hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
some mayne pointes of christian trueth, as namelie these:
<hi>There is one God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Read Azoara 2. 10. 15. 17. 20. 29. 45. 56.</note> 
               <hi>and that he created all things without labour or
wearines: and that he preserueth the things created: faith is giuen
and augmented of God. He forbiddeth the adoring of saintes and
images: affirmeth God to hate and abhorre the arte of Magicke:
and teacheth the resurrection of all men from the dead.</hi> Shewe vs
now whether the Turke be not of the familie of IESVS Christ.
Lastlie we pray you to open vnto vs, that seeing you saye the
church of Rome is the house of God, whether a man continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in that house, and neuer comming out to holde the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe
of Christ, as we doe in England, but renouncing and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
it to the death, whether such a one may be saued: if yea,
why need we seuer our selues to so great trouble from her grosse
and grieuous abhominations, if they bee not such as can extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
our faith to our destruction. If no, why doe you not ioyne
with our Reverend Fathers, to abandon that house where there
is no saluation. Of Gods house it is said: <hi>It is the
grounde &amp; pillar of trueth.</hi>

               <hi>they
shall still bring forth fruite in their age. &amp;c.</hi> Shew
vs wee pray you, whether these thinges may bee applied to the
church of Rome rightlie and essentiallie, and what comfort wee
may haue by departing from her communion; if shee be a parte
of the house of God. &amp;c. and these things we pray you to averre,
not by humane witnesse, but by that which commeth down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
heauen. So did Elias.</p>
            <p>Againe out of this article ariseth another noe

               <hi>God is the husbandman, the

of the worlde: and that not onely in the Apostles,
but also in the Preachers, who haue restored the
pure light of the Gospell in these latter dayes, euen
in those countries, whose Princes and people were
professed aduersaries therof: vnto which accordeth
the holy scriptures calling this preaching</hi>
               <note n="f" place="margin">Ephe. 3. 7.</note> 
               <hi>A gifte

thinges maketh vs much to muse what you meane where you
say,<note n="h" place="margin">Booke 5. pag. 46.</note> 
               <hi>Sith speach is the verie image whereby the minde and soule
of the speaker conveyeth it selfe into the bosome of him that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
We can not chuse but see great reason, wherefore the worde
that proceedeth from God, who is in him selfe very trueth and life,
should be (as the Apostle to the Hebrewes noteth) liuelie and
mightie in operation, sharper then any two edged sworde. Now if
in this and the like places, we did conceaue that our owne sermons
are that strong and forcible worde, should we not euen heereby im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte
euen the most peculiar glorie of the worde of God, vnto that
which is not his worde? For touching our sermons, that whiche gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
them their verie being, is the will of man, and therefore they
oftentimes accordinglie taste too much of that ouercorrupt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
from which they come.</hi> Heere Mai. <hi>Hoo.</hi> we are hampered
with your words, because they seeme to vs contrarie to the iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement
of our church. We therefore desire you hartilie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7977:12"/>
vs, what you meane in this place by sermons: whether it
be not all one with that our Fathers call preaching of the word,
consisting in teaching and exhorting by the worde of God; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condlie,
what you meane by the being of a sermon, whether the
Logicall and Dialecticall frame by which men contriue their
matter in such and such a forme: or that by the
gift of the grace of God,<note n="a" place="margin">Eccles. 12. 8.</note> 
               <hi>waying and searching
and fitting togither many sentences, they seeke out
pleasant wordes &amp; euery right writing and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
wordes, and so vtter</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Tit. 2. 7.</note> 
               <hi>in their doctrine, integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
grauitie, and the wholesome worde which can
not be reproued.</hi> If you meane the former, then euerie declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and formal oration in the schooles, may be called sermons,
for these are framed of the meere witt of man: if you meane this
latter, then we thinke you teach contrarie to our church &amp; the
holy scriptures. You say our sermons are not that stronge and
forcible worde: They saye, it is an essentiall note of the true
church, to haue true preaching of the worde: and namelie, the
preaching of the pure worde of GOD, and that this hath such a
force as no eloquence, wisedome, learning, pollicie, and power
of the worlde can match. You saye the witt of man giueth our
sermons the verie being. They say, God sent his Apostles: that
the Preachers are the seede sowers, and the seede is the worde of
God, and that this is done by the gift of the grace of God. Heere
we beseech you to shewe the iust harmonie of your wordes and
theirs, and therein to teach vs by sounde demonstration, that a
man can preach the pure worde of God by his owne naturall
witt, without a gift supernaturall of the spirit to giue him vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and to speak the word as he ought to speake. If all that a
man preach be the pure worde of God, what derogation is it to
call such a mans sermons or preachings the strong and forcible
worde. In euerie being there is (as you schollers teach) the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and the forme; and that which ioyneth these togither, is the
efficient. Vnto which of these will you applie the witt of man, if
you say to the matter, then our church is against you, and sayeth
it is the pure worde of God: if to the forme, as, interpretation,
doctrine and exhortation, then the holy scriptures doe tye vnto
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7977:12"/>
the gift of the spirit, saying:<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 12. 6.</note>

Here we pray you to teach vs how your speaches
consent to these testimonies of our church and holy Scripture;
or may you not meane that the Sermons of manie nowe a dayes
who in stead of the pure word of God, doe most curiouslie bring
into the pulpitt, <hi>Poetts, Philosophers, Rhetoricians, Phisitians,
Schoolemen,</hi> and whatsoeuer, either by finenesse of witt, or helpe
of arte, they thinke may appeare fine &amp; smooth to their hearers
and winne praise to them selues; may you not meane, I say, that
such our sermons haue their being of the meere witt of man; or
doe you thinke that the sermons of our Reuerend Fathers, and
more stayed diuines, which are verie warie, that in all their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
whatsoeuer they speake, may be the true sense of holie
Scriptures, and according to the proportion of faith; seeing they
agree not with the familie of Iesus Christ that is at Rome, are
not therefore the strong and forcible worde of God. And heere
we pray you to teach vs, whether that all doctrine, interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
and exhortation which is truelie and meerelie the natural mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of holy scripture be not the worde of God, or that the word
is onelie in the letter of the text, as of Hebrewe and Greeke, or,
if you will, truelie translated: and which of these hath the word
of God; he that alleadgeth the wordes as did the Tempter, or he
that alleadgeth the true meaninge, as did our Saviour Christ,
Mat. 4. 6. 10. Lastlie, shew vs that if all our sermons bee of the
witt of man, and none the stronge and forcible worde of God,
whether Romish Babilon may not chalendge our church to
wante one essentiall marke, as preaching the pure word of God?
And whether it be possible for the witt of man to giue beeing

Women to baptize: you (as wee thinke) contrarie to our

               <hi>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes
chiefest force and virtue consisteth in this that they are

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7977:15"/>
vs we pray you by holy scripture these three chief virtues of the
Sacraments. The furthest that they say (as we gather) is to make
them seales of assurance, by which the spirit worketh invisiblie
to strengthen our faith; and they seeme to square
their faith by holy scripture: which propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth

after receaued the Sacrament as a signe to bee a
seale of the righteousnesse of his faith. Shew therefore whether
we ought not to goe further then our church or holy scripture,
vnlesse we will leaue out the cheefest virtue of the Sacramentes.
Moreouer they say the grace of God is not in the visible signes;
you say, they are meanes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicionall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they say that grace (which
they cal <hi>this marvelous coniunction and incorporation</hi>) is first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon

by the Sacramentes: you say, the sacraments haue the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue
force and virtue as well as the worde. They say, that the

fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apostle out of the former recited place, Rom. 4. doeth
argue that the necessitie of the sacraments, is not comparable to
that of faith. For by this he proueth Abraham to be iustified by
faith without workes, because he first was iustified by faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he receaued the Sacrament, and that the Sacrament was
but a signe and seale of his faith; so that he excludeth the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as it is a worke, and as you call it<note n="a" place="margin">Booke 5. pag. 128.</note> a morall instrument of
salvation, from all copertenership with faith in the matter of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification.

not for the additament of workes vnto fayth, in that which the

lastly whether such speaches be not meerelie popish &amp; accursed

Sacraments then God hath ordayned; and heerein explane vnto
vs, whether a man dying without faith, &amp; yet receaueth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,

two opinions can stande togither. The one which sayeth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments

doubt of our Baptisme: the other, that the Sacraments haue not
the nature to be religious and misticall, without a serious mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

sacrament depende vpon the institution and promise of God, or
vpon the good meaning of the Priest or of the Church; or vpon
both: and whether they cannot haue the nature of religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

eie of the church of God but by new birth: nor according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
course of divine dispensation, new borne, but by that bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
which both declareth and maketh vs christians, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
we holde it to bee the doore of our actuall entrance into Gods
house, the first apparant beginning of life, a seale perhaps to the
grace of election before receaved, but to our sanctification heere a
stepp that hath not any before it.</hi> And againe:<note n="b" place="margin">Booke 5. pag. 146.</note> 
               <hi>The fruit of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
dependeth onely upon the couenant whiche God hath made;
that God by couenant requireth of the elder sorte fayth and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7977:17"/>
in childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the sacrament of Baptisme alone.</hi> And in another
place:<note n="c" place="margin">Ibi. pag. 135 136.</note> 
               <hi>We haue for baptisme no day sett as the Iewes had for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
neither haue wee by the lawe of God, but onely by the
churches discretion, a place therevnto appointed. Baptisme ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
euen in the meaning of the lawe of Christ, belongeth vnto in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantes
capable thereof, from the verie instant of their birth, which
if they haue not howsoeuer, rather then loose it by being put of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the time, the place, or some such like circumstance, doth not
solemnly enough concurre, the church as much as in her lyeth, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie
casteth away their soules.</hi> Heere are we at our wittes ende,
not knowing what to beleeue. For if our English confession bee
true that baptisme is a signe of regeneration, and visibly sealeth
our remission of sinnes and adoption, and increaseth grace, &amp;c.
we know not what to make of that you say: Baptisme to be the
first apparant beginning of life, a seale perhaps of the grace of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
and that there is no stepp of sanctification before Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.
And againe, if it be true (as you say) Predestination brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
not life without the grace of externall vocation, wherein
baptisme is implyed; what shall we thinke of that our Reverend
Fathers say: A man by Gods free election is holy and pure; and
that before Baptisme a man may stande in the state of salvation.
And if our churches doctrine be true; that baptisme is a seale of
remission of sinnes, and that the Sacramentes make not the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenantes
but are seales of the covenantes, howe can yours bee
true that by couenant God requireth fayth and baptisme in the
elder, and baptisme alone in children. Is baptisme parte of the
couenant, and more then a seale? And seeing our Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
affirme that God and well ordered churches forbidd bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
by women, and that God hath not inthralled his church
to such vrgent necessitie, and that such doctrine is fearfull, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and blasphemous, and our sweete and tender Father hath
saide: I will be thy God and thy childes, not adding anie condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of baptisme, if it cannot be had as it ought. How can it bee
well in you to make it a bloodie and wilfull casting away of
soules, if the church provide not that children haue baptisme
howsoeuer. And heere we pray you to teach vs whether the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
and Sacramentes in the Gospell bee not the same in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7977:17"/>
virtue and substance that they were vnder the lawe, or that
our Sacramentes haue more necessitie. And if so, why our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Fathers disavow the necessitie of Baptisme, to be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
other wise then as it ought, because God appointed circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
till the eight day, is there a further grace in our sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
or haue they not somewhat in the worke wrought, whiche the
Sacramentes of the law had not: We pray you therefore, plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
and distinctlie to shew vs your minde; whether righteousnes
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth by baptisme, or by faith. And seeing notwithstanding
all these harde and peremptorie speaches, you sometimes saye,
that<note n="a" place="margin">Pag. 134. 135.</note> 
               <hi>grace is not absolutelie tyed to sacramentes: and the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of receaving not so absolute, as that of administring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</hi>
Wee would faine knowe what you holde and affirme;
what manner of necessitie you meane. For if grace be not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutelie
tyed vnto Sacraments, and necessitie of receaving Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
not absolute; we knowe not what should make necessitie
of administring absolute, but that as our Reverend Fathers say,
we are not enthralled to appoint or suffer it to bee done by Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
or lay persons, if it cannot be had as it ought: and if GOD
haue not added any such condition of baptisme, where borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you that distinction? Wee can not tell where to finde you, or
how to take your meaning, or at the least that your minde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth
with the doctrine of the church of Englande: we expect
therefore and pray you to declare faithfullie these thinges vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

Which maketh vs to marvell howe our Church and Reverende
Fathers haue all this time passed, bene deceaued. What should
cause them to affirme it to bee a thing contrarie to the playne

to call it monstrous doctrine: why so manie reverend Fathers, as

condemne those millions of learned diuines and blessed Martirs

we haue not iust cause to iudge, that in penning this storie,
you make of Calvin, your purpose were not to deceaue your

the hollow &amp; glittering threed of your owne wittie coniectures
and peremptorie censures; as namelie when you beginne to tell
of the repentance of the people of Genevah,<note place="margin">pag. 5. 6.</note> irefullie champing
vpon the bitt: you suddenlie fall into a discourse of the rising vp
of those reformed churches; you besprinckle them with likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of desire of glorie of their owne enterprises; you blame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
that in that troublesome time they wanted common co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ference,
and that afterwardes least they should derogate from their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
they became euer after resolute to maintayne that whiche
they had done, and so leauing the churches all bespotted with
leuitie and selfepride, and eased of all conscience and honestie;
you closelie thrust in Calvin with this worde, therefore: that he
and his associates (as parteners of the same selfe weening) stiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
refusing to administer the holie Communion, were banished

            <p>We beseech you also helpe vs in these things following. First
the true storie saith,<note place="margin">The. Beza in vit. Calvini.</note> Many being at the first gently admonished,
for many vnworthy acts, and for old enmitie among the chiefe

               <hi>Genevah</hi> was difference in certayne rites, which while they were

the chief Magistrates for that yeare of <hi>Genevah,</hi> being the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes
of the factions and discorde, assembling the people
brought the matter to this ende; that these three faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
of God were commanded to depart the towne within two
dayes. And when these Officers, like vnto filthy froth, were cast
out (the one accused of seditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> going about to escape through a
window, falling downe headlong, by the pease of his bodie, was
so hurte that within few dayes hee dyed: another for murther
was put to death, and the two other being accused for ill gouern
ment in a certaine embassage, forsooke the cuntrie, and were
condemned being absent; the Citie then began to seeke againe
for their Farellus and Calvin. You say when these things began
to bee put in vre;<note place="margin">pag. 5. 6. 7.</note> the people began to repent them of that they
had done; the rather for that they grew by meanes of this inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

and so Calvin and his associates (as is afore said) were banished,
and that after the places of one or two of their Ministers beeing
fallen voyde, they are importunate to obtayne Calvin agayne,
and that they were content the other two should enioy their
exile. The contradiction of these two stories we pray you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile,
eyther by the 24. <hi>epist.</hi> which you cite, or by anie true
narration whatsoeuer. First shew vs that the dislike of other
churches was for discipline, and that for that dislike the towne
was the rather mooued against Calvin. And whether rather
these churches did not make intercession by the decree of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node
for Calvin to the Genevians. Secondlie, whether those
Sindickes being wicked and taken away by the righteous iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of almightie God, the people were not made free from
the former factions: and whether that thervpon the Lord moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
their mindes, they remembred not the iniuries done to
those two good Pastors. And shewe vs by cleare demonstration
they sought not as well for <hi>Farellus</hi> as for <hi>Calvin.</hi> And heere
also without your helpe, wee knowe not what construction to
make of your descanting on the Ministers, assuring Calvin of
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7977:21"/>
their allegeance, his returning as it had bene another <hi>Tullie,</hi> and
the assenting of the people with no lesse alacritie of minde then
cities vnable to holde outlonger. Are these anie other but bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
skornes and despitefull fictions? And to omitt many things
(because this is a personall cause) we doe most hartilie begge at
your handes to aunswere vs truelie and faithfullie, whether you
thinke Maister Calvin to haue bene an honest truehearted chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
fearing God, and not an imposter and a deceaver of the
people, or at the least you would haue men so to esteeme of him.
For howe can wee otherwise coniecture in that you blame him
more for the countenancing of discipline beeing established,<note place="margin">pag. 10. 11.</note>
then for establishing of it, affirming with no small incitements
of cunning insinuations, that because hee by wisedome and not
by the word of God, saw that discipline requisite for that people,
hee imployed all his witt by sifting the very vtmost sentence
and sillable of holy Scripture to confirme the same; and not
to omit the leaste occasion in all his writinges following of
extolling the vse and singular necessitie thereof. If wee may
thus iudge of his faithfulnesse in promoting of discipline, what
may wee suspect of his sincere dealing in the doctrine? About
rites (as the ministring with common bread) you acknowledge
that he would not stande with the Church, to make trouble for
a thinge indifferent, and why if he were a good man, should we
thinke that hee would professe it to bee trayterous
cowardlines,<note place="margin">Epist. 165.</note> not to dye a hundred times rather then
to suffer that to bee wickedly borne downe which
hee very well knew to bee taken out of the word of God? Can
you so farre make manifest eyther by good and iust presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or by playne and true storie, his deepe hipocrisie and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
pride; that euen against his owne conscience; hee woulde
so earnestly striue and trouble the whole Church to maintaine
a deuise of his owne? Wee pray you therefore to shewe vs sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerelie
whether such insinuations bee charitable? and whether
if you bee a friend to the Gospell, you make not a greater rent
in Gods Church, by such arguments then if you medled not at
all in the matter, but left it to men of more stayde and sounde
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7977:22"/>
discretion and of a more charitable and peaceable spirite. For
if such bolde and bare affirmations may goe for payment, why
may wee not as well heare and beleeue Maister Harding, which
calles all the whole and pure doctrine beleeued and professed in
England;<note n="a" place="margin">In his Epist. to Bb. Iewell</note> 
               <hi>A wicked new deuise of Geneva.</hi> We desire you ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

and without partialitie, and that men haue not iust cause to
thinke the better of Maister Calvin and the cause of discipline,
when they see so litle plaine and faithfull dealing in your wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

If you doe not sincerelie, plainelie and truelie aunswere all these

haue men to deeme her Maiestie to haue done ill in abolishing

religious and peaceable heart of our deare soueraigne Ladie and

the thousandes of faithfull subiectes, who haue learned Christ
vnder the shadowe of her most happie and honorable reigne;
would euer giue you thankes for such great service, or euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
vnto such abhominations, if they should once beginne to
espie such stratagemicall operations to appeare in their effectes,
and to shewe them selues directlie and openlie: We beseech you
therefore in the Name of IESVS Christ, and as you will aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
for the vse of those great giftes which God hath bestowed
vpon you, that you woulde returne and pervse advisedlie all
your five bookes, compare them with the articles of our profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
set out by publick authoritie, and with the workes Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geticall
&amp; other authorised sermons &amp; homilies of our church,
and of the Reverend Fathers of our Lande, and with the holie
booke of God, and all other the Queenes Maiesties proceedings:
and then read and examine with an indifferent &amp; equall minde
a booke sett out in Latin called <hi>Querimonia Ecclesiae,</hi> and an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Englishe, late come abroade, speaking of Scotizing and
Genevatising, &amp; Allobrogicall Discipline: and having mature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
with a iudicious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science in the feare of God, pondered and
wayed them in the ballance of trueth and iustice, then tell vs
roundlie and soothelie: That if the Reverende Fathers of our
church, assisted with some of the approved divines of both Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
did reade, peruse and examine your bookes, and those
two other bookes, whether they would not iudge in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and giue sentence with their mouthes, that by those
three writinges, the Church of Englande and all other christian
Churches, are vndermined, and that they are verie notable bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
(if Gods mercie stayed it not) to blowe the coales of sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and fierie civill warre betweene all christian Churches; and
to make all people, who reade them, to fall either flatly to Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme
or backewarde to poperie, when they shall see all godlie
Ministers and christian churches, by men of their owne side and
profession, to be so openlie traduced and notoriouslie detected,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7977:23"/>
and all the articles of our Religion &amp; many partes of our church
government to be checked, blamed, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradicted. And might
they not thinke that the Popes factors in Englande, haue some
intelligence with such writers? Or is that new found discipline
so neerlie seated with our English creed; that such expert archers
ayming at the one, must needes hit the other?</p>
            <p>Our last scruple and demaund is this,<note place="margin">21. The stile &amp; maner of writing.</note> seeing your bookes
bee so long and tedious, in a stile not vsuall, and (as wee verelie
thinke) the like harde to be found; farre differing from the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie
of holie Scripture, and nothing after the frame of the
writinges of the Reverend and learned Fathers of our church, as
of <hi>Crammer, Ridley, Latimer, Iewell, Whitgeeft, Fox, Fulke, &amp;c.</hi>
And that your Prefaces and discourses before you come to the
question are so longe, &amp; mingled with all kinde of matters and
sutes of learning and doctrine: whether your meaning bee to
shewe your selfe to bee some rare Demosthenes, or extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Rabbi, or some great Pythagoras, that enioyne your schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
or your adversaries to fiue yeares silence, before they can be
perfect in your meaning or able to replye: or that these men you
write against, bee not sounde in matters of fayth; and therefore
you handle all thinges, or else you had no better way to make
doubtfull the chief groundes of our faith and religion, and that
you would haue men better seene in Philosophie and schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
diuinitie, and namelie in Aristotle: or that you were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fearde,<note place="margin">Read book 2. pag. 58.</note>
that if you had not handled it with so graue, heroicall
and loftie a maiestie, you should haue bene reputed like some
other man, and so your same should haue bene but small: or
that you would wearie your aduersarie with such thicke and
continuall fallinge strokes, that hee should not bee able to
stande before you to strike one blow against you, or that you
would beare downe the cause with swelling wordes of vanitie,
and cunningly framed sentences to blinde and intangle the
simple; or that you would shew your selfe another Aristotle by a
certaine metaphisicall and crupticall method to bring men into
a maze, that they should rather wonder at your learning, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be
able to vnderstand what you teach in your writinge. Wee which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7977:24"/>
stande for the defence of our English church highly commend
R. H. bookes, wee alleadge your opinions as well as wee can to
stop the mouthes of foolish carpers: Wee commend your books
as very excellent and learnedly penned, and not to be answered;
then they promptly aske your reasons and require of vs to shew
by what arguments you maintaine those assertions: then returne
wee to your bookes; wee seeke and beate our braynes, but are
hardely able, by our meane capacitie, to gather any thinge: but
as a man a farre of beholding a bryer tree; all blowen ouer with
his flowers, with great desire approacheth neere vnto it, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
himselfe deceaved; so the delight of reading your booke
is meruelous great, but the fruit thereof (howsoeuer it come to
passe) vnto vs that search and examine it, is far vnlike the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
shew and appearance. In the booke of that most learned and
reuerend Father D. Withgift: wee finde the question iudicially
sett downe, his aunswere to the matter in question sensible, his
reasons eyther from holy scripture, from Fathers or new writers,
without all circumferences and crooked windings, directly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
so as such poore men as wee be may beare away what hee
saith and what hee intendeth: but in your writing wee are
mightely incombred; wee walke as in a labyrinth, and are sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denlie
ouerwhelmed as in the deepe sea: sometime it seemeth
to vs that wee see great florishing of warlike and glittering wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
and to heare the lowde outcryes and noyce of them which
pursue their enemies in battell, thundring, gunshott, tossing of
speares, and ratling of harnesse; yet cannot we perfectly perceaue
any thinge almost rightly to touch the aduersarie pretended;
but rather (as in our demandes before wee verely thinke doeth
manifestly appeare) most heauie stroakes, poysoned pellettes,
and dangerous pushes of the pikes, against the Ierusalem of
God, the holy Christian church of Englande, whom you would
seeme to defende. Wee desire you therefore with all instancie,
that you would not denie vs three things. First to shewe vnto vs
what arguments you haue alleadged which are materiall and
of waight, which are not to bee found in the aunswere of that
reuerend Father vnto Maister Carthwright; and herein plainly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7977:24"/>
to de clare which be your arguments or direct aunswers, which
are neither fine and close Ironies, or blustring bitter scoffes, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of the question, or peremptorie affirmations, and how wee
may knowe what is the state of the question, and when you are
in or out, and what you holde in your conscience to bee the
trueth in Gods sight: howe great and large your fiue bookes
would bee, if you had vsed reasonable, intelligible and logicall
argumentes onely as other writers and disputers doe, and had
left out all needlesse wittie gloses and Rhetoricall shadowes in
preambles, discourses, digressions, amplifications, and had kept
your selfe out of the common iayle of sophisticall elenches, and
impertinent outleapes, and had followed S. Peters prescript,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 15. 16</note> in
a meeke, reuerend and direct apollogie and defense proceeding
from a good conscience. Secondly, that if you sett foorth your
other bookes which are promised, you would bee more playne
and sensible; and followe the vsuall language and stile of other
learned men and English writers; leauing out vnnecessarie long
discourses, and common places, sett out your reasons in playne
termes and wordes of sinceritie, without these hugie embosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
or stuffed bumbasing, that poore playne men, which
cannot skill of such hidden misteries, may perceaue and learne
something by your great travailes. Thirdly that you would bee
carefull not to corrupt the English creede and pure doctrine
(whervnto you haue subscribed) either by philosophie or vaine
deceate of schoolemens newborne diuinitie, or by any other
beggerly rudiments of this worlde, nor sett these Churches by
the eares with these closely caried and daintie insinuations, and
that through desire of vayne glorie you prouoke not your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and helpe the common and sworne enemie, which figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
against God, against Christes church, against our peaceable
cuntrie, and against our religious, godly and christian Princesse.
And especially that you beware in the cause of supremacie to
giue your lawfull soueraigne her right and full due, and not so
to make the Church of Rome of the familie of Christ IESVS,<note place="margin">Sar. contr. B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
