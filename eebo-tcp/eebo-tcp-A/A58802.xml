            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THose excellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of <hi>Christian Life,</hi> which were publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some years since by the learned <hi>Author,</hi> have, I doubt not, in a great measure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered his Design, in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, which was to do as much good as he could to the World; and had he
<pb facs="tcp:34683:3"/>
lived to finish the other Parts of it, we might have had such a compleat Body of Christian Institutions in our own Language, as would have highly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted towards a Revival of true Piety among us. For, besides those Pieces which have already seen the Light, 'twas the <hi>Author's</hi> design to proceed to a particular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Duties which Men are obliged to render to <hi>God,</hi> their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and <hi>Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;</hi> and for a Conclusion of all, he proposed a distinct Treatise of <hi>Ecclesiastical Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34683:3"/>The two Discourses of <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> which I now present to your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> were intended as a Part of that Duty which we owe to one another, and which, with other Enlargements, had the <hi>Author</hi> liv'd, would have made a Volume of themselves. And the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of <hi>Mortification</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a Part of what He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for the Explication of that Duty which Man owes himself, which was also intended for another distinct Volume. Besides these he proposed a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Examination of those
<pb facs="tcp:34683:4"/>
great Duties, which <hi>God</hi> requires; which together with the other Volumes would have compleated the whole Design. In Justice therefore to the Memory of this <hi>incomparable Person,</hi> I thought my self obliged to communicate to your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> this short Account of him. The Design which he proposed was Great and Noble, and I'm sure those <hi>Pieces</hi> which he hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready published, do loudly speak the Excellent Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications with which <hi>God</hi> had endowed him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat it, had not a <hi>laborious</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:34683:4"/>
               <hi>Station,</hi> and, what was worse, a very <hi>sickly Constitution</hi> at last interrupted him from the Prosecution of it.</p>
            <p>As for these <hi>Remains,</hi> they are faithfully transcribed from the <hi>Author's Manuscript;</hi> and your <hi>Lordship</hi> may easily discern that they are his true and genuine Off-spring by your Perusal of them. I know your <hi>Lordship</hi> hath a very high Value and just Esteem for the Memory of that <hi>great and good Man,</hi> and that is a prevailing Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to take into your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection those Works which he has left behind him. To
<pb facs="tcp:34683:5"/>
You they address them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and I doubt not but under that <hi>Character</hi> which your <hi>Lordship</hi> bears, they will be sufficiently recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the World; and that they may effectually promote the <hi>Good</hi> of it, is the hearty Prayer of</p>

               <p>I. I shall endeavour to shew, what that Justice is which is owing to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. In general therefore, <hi>Iustice</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in giving to every one his due; in which latitude it comprehendeth all matter of duty: for every Duty is a due to <hi>God,</hi> or our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> or our <hi>selves,</hi> and accordingly every performance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very duty is a payment of some due; and, as such is an act of <hi>Righteousness.</hi> And therefore in Scripture Good Men are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently stiled <hi>Righteous,</hi> and the Whole of Vertue and Goodness is called <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> because it is a payment of some due either to <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>selves,</hi> or our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi> But <hi>Iustice</hi> being here consider'd as a <hi>distinct,</hi> and <hi>particular Vertue,</hi> must be understood in a more limited sense; <hi>viz.</hi> for Honesty in all our dealings with men, or giving to every man his due with whom we have any Intercourse. And
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34683:15"/>
wherein this consisteth, will best appear by considering what those things are which are due from one Man to another, or what those Dues and Rights are which men may claim by the <hi>eternal Laws</hi> of Righteousness. And these are twofold, 1. Natural, and 2. Acquired.</p>
               <p>I begin with the First, <hi>viz.</hi> the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Rights of Men, which are such as appertain to Men, as they are <hi>Reasonable Creatures,</hi> and dwelling in Mortal Bodies, and joyned to one another by their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Relations, and by Society. For in all these capacities there accrue to men certain <hi>Natural Rights</hi> which we are obliged in Justice <hi>not</hi> to <hi>violate,</hi> but so far as we can to <hi>secure</hi> and <hi>make good</hi> to one another.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, Therefore we will consider men as dwelling in <hi>mortal Bodies;</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, As <hi>Rational</hi> Creatures;</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, As joyned to one another by <hi>natural Relations;</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Fourthly, As naturally united in <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> and I will shew what Rights there are redounding to them from all these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, and Considerations.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I. WE will consider Men as dwelling in <hi>mortal Bodies,</hi> in which there is a twofold Right accruing to them: 1. a Right to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34683:16"/>
their <hi>Bodies:</hi> 2. a Right to their bodily <hi>Subsistence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. As dwelling in <hi>mortal Bodies,</hi> they have a natural Right to their <hi>Bodies,</hi> and to all the <hi>Parts</hi> of them, for their <hi>Bodies</hi> being the <hi>Tenements</hi> which the great Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord of the world hath allotted to their <hi>Souls</hi> during their abode in this terrestrial State, are upon that account their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right; which unless they forfeit, they cannot be deprived of without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest <hi>Injury</hi> and <hi>Injustice.</hi> For if <hi>God</hi> gave this <hi>Body</hi> to <hi>my Soul,</hi> it is certain that immediately under him my <hi>Soul</hi> hath a Right to it, and holding in <hi>Capite</hi> as it doth from the Supreme Proprietor, is Tenant at will to none but him, for this its earthly Habitation: so that <hi>antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to all Humane Laws and Constitutions, every <hi>Soul</hi> is vested with a natural Right to its own <hi>Body;</hi> as being placed in and put in possession of it by the God of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and till by its own free Act it hath <hi>alienated,</hi> or <hi>forfeited</hi> its Right, there is none but God, (who hath reserved to himself the <hi>Soveraign</hi> and <hi>absolute</hi> disposal of it) can justly either dispossess a Soul of its <hi>Body,</hi> or of any <hi>Part</hi> or <hi>Member</hi> of it; or offer any violence to the Body,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or put it any farther out of its Souls Disposal,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34683:16"/>
than God himself hath done by placing it under the outward Restraints of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> So that for any one either to kill or dismember a Body, whose Soul hath not <hi>forfeited</hi> its Right to it; to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish, inslave or imprison a Body, whose Soul hath neither alienated, nor forfeited its Right to dispose of it, is a piece of high and crying <hi>Injustice.</hi> In short, God hath placed the <hi>immortal Soul</hi> of man in the Tenement of a <hi>mortal Body,</hi> in which it hath thereupon the Right of a Tenant at will, that holdeth at the pleasure of his Landlord; by whom it is impowred to injoy it for its own Habitation, to defend it against outward Violence, and dispose of it for its own needs and conveniences. So that unless he be impowred by <hi>God,</hi> there is no <hi>Man</hi> can rightfully destroy or dismember, or without his Consent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave or imprison another Man's Body; unless it be in defence of his own Life, or Livelyhood, or Liberty, which every man hath a natural Right to defend. But then since for the common Good and Defence of all, God hath placed his <hi>reserved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> over our Bodies in the hands of <hi>humane Government,</hi> it is no violation of the Right of our Souls, for the <hi>Government</hi> under which we are placed, to destroy or
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:34683:17"/>
dismember, inslave or imprison our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; whenever by offending others, we render it <hi>necessary</hi> for the <hi>Defence</hi> and <hi>Good of All.</hi> And since the <hi>Government</hi> hath, so far as the Common-Weal requireth, <hi>God's</hi> own <hi>Authority</hi> over our Bodies in its hands; it is no more injurious to our Souls, for <hi>That</hi> to dispose of our Lives and Members, Livelyhoods and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for the common Security and Good; than if God himself should do it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; since the Government doth it by <hi>his Right</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> which is <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount</hi> to all the natural Rights of our Souls. But for any others either to take away the Life, or Members of anothers Body, except it be necessary for their own defence; or to endeavour the carnal Injoyment of anothers Body, except it be by the party's consent; or to inslave, or imprison anothers Body, except it be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on free Consent, or just Forfeiture, is an outragious Invasion of the natural Rights of humane Souls.</p>
               <p>II. As Men dwell in <hi>mortal Bodies,</hi> they have also a Right to their <hi>bodily Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence.</hi> For, for God to give them a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant's right in their mortal Bodies would be very insignificant, unless we suppose he hath therewith given them some Right
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34683:17"/>
to those <hi>outward Goods,</hi> that are necessary to their <hi>Maintenance</hi> and <hi>Subsistence:</hi> For God being the Supreme Proprietor of this lower Word, as well as of those Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Flesh we live in; it must needs be supposed, that, as by placing our Soul in this Body, he hath given <hi>her</hi> a Right to it; so by placing our Body in this World, he hath given <hi>it</hi> a Right to such a portion of this World's Goods, as are <hi>necessary</hi> to its <hi>Repair</hi> and <hi>Maintenance.</hi> And though in the unequal Division of the World, that now is, he hath given to some a larger share of it than to others; yet it is not to be supposed he hath so appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated <hi>All</hi> to some, as to leave nothing for all the Rest. For as all Men are <hi>equal</hi> in their <hi>natural Faculties</hi> and <hi>Indowments,</hi> so according to <hi>original Constitution</hi> they were also equal in their <hi>outward Properties</hi> and <hi>Possessions;</hi> and all things being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously exposed to the Use and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of <hi>All,</hi> every one from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Stock assumed as his own Right what he ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ded. And as for the <hi>Inequality</hi> and <hi>private Interests</hi> that are now among us, they were By-blows of our <hi>Fall;</hi> for it was Sin that introduced our Degrees and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that devised the Names of <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Poor,</hi> begot Ingrossings and Inclosures
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34683:18"/>
of Things, and forged those two pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent words <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> which have since ingendred so much Strife and Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief in the World. And though God hath made these Inclosures <hi>Rights</hi> by his long and continued permission of them, yet he hath not thereby parted with his own Right to them; He by an immute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Right is still <hi>Paramount</hi> of all his Creation, and every thing in it unalienably belongeth to him. And as for those <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed Properties,</hi> with which he hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted us in such unequal Proportions, he hath committed them to us as <hi>Stewards,</hi> and not transferred them upon us as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;</hi> and so without any Injury to us, may appropriate what <hi>Part</hi> of them he pleaseth to what <hi>Use</hi> he pleaseth: which when he hath done, we cannot without manifest Injustice otherwise dispose of that <hi>appropriate Part,</hi> than to the use and service for which <hi>he</hi> hath appointed it. Now out of every mans Estate and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty he hath actually reserved some <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate</hi> portion to be disposed of to the Poor and Needy, who have nothing else to subsist by; and in this part of our Estates the <hi>Poor</hi> have the same Right from <hi>God,</hi> that we have in all the other Parts of it. So that this World being now can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:34683:18"/>
out so very unequally among men, yet according to <hi>God's Allotment</hi> every Man hath Right to such a Share of it, as is at least sufficient to keep him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing starved, or pinched with <hi>Extremity</hi> of Need; and in this Method God hath as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to every man a <hi>Child's Portion,</hi> which in some fair way or other ought to be obtained, <hi>viz.</hi> either by <hi>legal Right,</hi> or by <hi>humble Request;</hi> which latter, in Conscience, ought to take effect, as well as the former. For now according to this later Constitution he hath appointed the <hi>Rich</hi> to be his Stewards and Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers for the <hi>Poor;</hi> with a strict charge that they dispense to every one <hi>his meat in due season.</hi> The <hi>Honour</hi> of distributing is conferred on the former, as a tryal of their Fidelity and Bounty; the <hi>Right</hi> of receiving is conferred on the latter, as a tryal of their Patience and Gratitude: and thus God hath wifely projected, that all his Children should be both effectually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and quietly provided for; that one man's <hi>Abundance</hi> should <hi>supply</hi> another's <hi>Wants,</hi> that so there might be an <hi>Equality,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresseth it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 14. For since no Man can enjoy <hi>more</hi> than he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and every Man ought to have <hi>so much</hi> as he needeth, there could be no <hi>great</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:34683:19"/>
Inequality among men, if things were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred according to the Institution of God. But if out of our Abundance we refuse to relieve the poor Man's Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we are unjust both to God and him; to God, because we misapply his Goods, and cross his Orders; to him, because we wrongfully usurp, and detain from him the portion which God hath allowed him; and so under a Vizard of Right, and Possession, we are no better than Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the Account of God; when by refusing to relieve our Brothers necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we spoil him of his Goods; <hi>his Goods</hi> I say, by the very same Title that any thing is ours, even by the free Donation of God. 'Tis the <hi>hungry</hi> Man's Bread which we hoard up in our Barns, his Meat that we glut, and <hi>his</hi> Drink that we guzzle: 'tis the <hi>naked</hi> Man's Apparel that we shut up in our Presses, and do so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitantly ruffle and flaunt in; and what we <hi>deny</hi> out of our Abundance to an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of real <hi>Pity,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> is in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of God an unjust <hi>Usurpation</hi> of his Right. For by the Institution of God, I <hi>owe</hi> every man this <hi>Right;</hi> not to see him pine, and perish for want, whilst I sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, and swim in Plenty. And thus you see what Rights appertain to a Man in his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34683:19"/>
first Capacity, <hi>viz.</hi> as inhabiting a <hi>Mortal Body.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>II. I Proceed in the <hi>second</hi> place to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, That there are other Rights accruing to Men, as they are <hi>Rational Creatures:</hi> for it is this indeed that giveth a Right to common Justice, to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by <hi>Laws,</hi> and by Rewards and Punishments, that we are free and Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Agents who can <hi>chuse</hi> or <hi>refuse,</hi> and determine our selves which way soever we think fit or reasonable. For without <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Free Will,</hi> we could no more be capable of Laws, nor subject to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Punishments than Stones or Trees are: For no Law can oblige a Being that hath no <hi>Power</hi> over his own Actions; nor can he deserve to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded when he doth <hi>well,</hi> nor punished when he doth <hi>evil,</hi> if it be not in his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:34683:20"/>
                  <hi>Power</hi> to do otherwise: and therefore Beasts cannot be said to do either <hi>justly,</hi> or <hi>unjustly</hi> towards one another; because whatsoever <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> they do one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they do it <hi>necessarily,</hi> and it was not in their power to do otherwise. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Men are <hi>free Agents,</hi> and have power to determine themselves either to do good or evil to one another; therefore of right they claim of each other the <hi>mutual</hi> Performance of such Goods, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of such Evils as agree or disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with the State, and Condition of their Natures. And hence every Rational Creature hath a <hi>Right</hi> to be used and treated by those of his own Kind, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to the state of his Rational Nature; and for one Man to treat another other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, is not only <hi>hurtful,</hi> but also <hi>injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> Now the Rights which one Rational Creature may by the condition of his Nature claim of another, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to these four particulars;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, Every Man has a Right to an <hi>equitable Treatment</hi> from every man.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, Every Man hath a Right to <hi>judge</hi> for himself so far as he is capable.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, Every Man hath a Right not to be <hi>forced,</hi> or <hi>impelled</hi> to <hi>act</hi> contrary to the Judgment of right Reason.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:34683:20"/>Fourthly, Every Man hath a Right to be <hi>respected</hi> by every man according to the dignity of his Nature.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I. EVERY Man hath a Right to an <hi>equitable Treatment</hi> from every man, that is, to be treated according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of that Golden Rule of Equity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> vii. 12. <hi>Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets, i. e.</hi> in all your Intercourses with men, suppose you had exchanged conditions with them, and that you were in theirs, and they in yours; and be sure you do them all that good, which upon a due conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the case, you could reasonably expect, or desire of them, if you were in their persons and circumstances. And this Right of being treated by others, as they would expect to be treated by us, supposing they were in our Circumstances, ariseth from that <hi>equality</hi> of Nature that is between us, which giveth every one a right to be equally treated by every one, and to claim all those good Offices from others which they might reasonably claim of him, if they were in his state and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. For we being all propagated from the <hi>same</hi> Loins, and partakers of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:34683:21"/>
                  <hi>same</hi> Nature, every Man in the world is by cognation of blood, and agreement of nature every man's <hi>Brother,</hi> and <hi>Kinsman.</hi> We are all but so many several Streams is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing from one <hi>common Source,</hi> but so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny several Twigs sprouting from the <hi>same Stock;</hi> we are all of us but <hi>one Blood</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived through several Channels; but <hi>one Substance</hi> multiplyed, and dilated into se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Times and Places, by the miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Efficacy of the divine Benediction. We are all fashioned according to the same <hi>Original Idea,</hi> resembling God our common Father: we are all endowed with the same Faculties, Inclinations, and Affections; and do all conspire in the same essential Ingredients of our Nature: and there is nothing doth distinguish, or diversifie us, but what is <hi>accidental</hi> to our <hi>Being;</hi> such as Age and Place, Figure, and Stature, Colour and Garb; so that every man is not only our most lively <hi>Image,</hi> but in a manner our very <hi>Substance,</hi> or another Our Self, under a small Variation of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Circumstances; which Circumstances are to be considered in every application of the above-named Rule of <hi>Equality</hi> to our Actions. If I am <hi>superior</hi> to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either in my place, or Relation, or in the Goods of my Mind, or Fortune; I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34683:21"/>
am only obliged by this Rule, to do that by him which I might reasonably desire he should do by me, were he as much <hi>my Superior,</hi> as I am <hi>his.</hi> But when all Men <hi>naturally</hi> as such are equal, and do stand upon even terms and level ground, there ought to be no other Inequality in their mutual Treatment of one another, but what is owing to the Inequality of their Circumstances: and he who doth that to another man, which upon good Reason he would not have another do to him in the same Circumstances, doth unjustly <hi>usurp</hi> a Superiority over him, which neither <hi>Nature,</hi> nor <hi>Providence</hi> alloweth of. For there is no Proposition in the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks more self-evident than this, <hi>Paria paribus conveniunt,</hi> equal Things agree to equal Persons; and therefore since we are all equal by Nature, whatsoever things are due to <hi>me,</hi> must by the same reason be due to <hi>another</hi> in the same Circumstances; and therefore he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth to another Man that which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth he might justly claim of him in the same condition, unjustly with-holds from him a Right that is due to him as he is his Equal in Nature.</p>
               <p>II. EVERY Man hath a Right to <hi>judge</hi> for himself so far as he is capable: for we
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:34683:22"/>
must either suppose that every <hi>Being</hi> hath a Right to <hi>use</hi> its own Faculties, or else that it hath its Faculties <hi>in vain:</hi> for to what purpose serve its Faculties, if it hath no Right to make <hi>use</hi> of them? And to what purpose serveth our Faculty of Reason, but only to <hi>judge</hi> for our selves in all such matters as fall within the Sphere of our Cognizance? Which if our Reason be debarred of, it standeth for a lonely Cypher in our Natures and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together <hi>useless</hi> and <hi>insignificant?</hi> And if in any thing our Reason hath a Right to <hi>judge</hi> for us, then much more in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> in which our highest and most important Interest is concerned. So that to deny it the Right of judging for us here, is to render it useless in our greatest Importance, and to disable our <hi>best Faculty</hi> from being serviceable to our <hi>best Interest.</hi> 'Tis true, there are sundry <hi>Controversies</hi> about religious Matters, which every Man's Reason cannot judge of; the Arguments <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con</hi> depending either upon <hi>Criticisms</hi> of Language, or <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Niceties, or ancient <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> which are all beyond the Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of persons of mean and vulgar Understandings: who are therefore obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in all such matters as these to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:34683:22"/>
to the Determination of their <hi>lawful Guides</hi> and <hi>Governours.</hi> But as for the great and <hi>necessary matters</hi> of Religion, they are plain and obvious to the meanest Understanding; and consequently herein every man ought to exercise his natural Right of <hi>judging</hi> for himself, and not swallow his Religion blindfold, without trying it by the <hi>Test</hi> of his Reason. And certainly they who remove the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of Religion out of the Court of Reason, take away that which doth most properly and naturally fall under its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. For Religion is the <hi>Chief End</hi> of Man's Creation, as he is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Being, and thereby capable of Religion: and to be sure where the <hi>End</hi> is natural, the <hi>Means</hi> must be so too. And therefore as Horses that were made for Burthen, have a natural Ability to bear; and as Birds that were made to fly, have a faculty and Wings for that purpose; so rational Souls that were made for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, must needs be supposed to have some <hi>Power</hi> naturally placed in them, for the <hi>Exercise,</hi> and <hi>Iudgment,</hi> and <hi>Choice</hi> of it. And what else can that be but their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? So that to deny Men the Liberty to <hi>judge</hi> for themselves in that which is their <hi>natural End</hi> and <hi>highest Interest,</hi> is as great
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:34683:23"/>
a piece of <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Injustice</hi> as can be offered to humane Nature. And of this very matter the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is highly guilty; for it commandeth <hi>Assent</hi> without Evidence, and imperiously requireth Men to believe her Doctrines without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; to rely <hi>implicitly</hi> upon her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and swallow down her Faith by the <hi>lump,</hi> without ever inquiring whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Physick, or Poyson. For the leading Principle of the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion is this, that the Churches <hi>Authority</hi> is the <hi>Reason</hi> of our Faith, and that Men are bound to believe what she believeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further proof or evidence; by which tyrannical Proceedure She useth her wretched Children, as the <hi>Philistins</hi> did <hi>Sampson,</hi> first putteth out their Eyes, and recreateth herself with their Blindness and Ignorance. For unless they wink hard, and believe at a venture whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she proposeth, they are sure to feel the <hi>Edges</hi> both of her spiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral <hi>Swords;</hi> and though they are never so modest, peaceable and humble in their dissents, to incur her Anathemas, which have always the sting of Fire and Faggot in the tayl of them. Now what is this but to <hi>force</hi> the Opinions of Men, and <hi>drive</hi> their Reason from its Throne of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:34683:23"/>
Judicature? For he that punisheth a man <hi>barely</hi> for his <hi>Opinion,</hi> doth in so doing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to rob him of his natural Right of <hi>judging</hi> for himself: which is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Tyranny in the World, it being an exercise of Dominion over the minds of men, which are subject only to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of God. 'Tis true, if in judging for themselves Men take up Opinions that are <hi>vicious,</hi> or <hi>destructive</hi> to Government, their wicked Practice is justly punishable according to the proportion of its Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity; for otherwise Men's right of <hi>judging</hi> for themselves will soon be made a Sanctuary for all the Villanies in the World. And though no Man ought to be punished <hi>barely</hi> for his Opinion, yet he may be justly punished for <hi>practising</hi> his Opinion, though his practice be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> in its own Nature. For <hi>indifferent</hi> Things which God hath neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, nor forbidden; are the proper matter of all <hi>humane Laws;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if upon a false Opinion that what the Law enjoyns is not <hi>indifferent,</hi> but <hi>sinful.</hi> I practise contrary to the Law, I am just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>punishable;</hi> because my Mistake alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the nature of the thing. If it be <hi>indifferent,</hi> it is a proper object of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws, whether I think it so or no;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:34683:24"/>
and as such may justly be <hi>imposed;</hi> and the Imposition being just in it self, our not complying with it is justly punishable. Once more; though no Man ought to be punished for his <hi>Opinion,</hi> yet he may be justly punishable for making a publick <hi>Profession</hi> of it; for there is no doubt but Men may be restrained by Laws from <hi>propagating</hi> their little Opinions into Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and dividing themselves upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different persuasion into opposite Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Otherwise it will be impossible, considering the Passions of Men, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any <hi>Unity,</hi> or <hi>Concord</hi> in civil, or sacred Societies. And therefore where such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striction is, Men ought to be satisfied with this, that they freely enjoy their liberty of <hi>Opining,</hi> and are not deprived of their natural Right to <hi>judge</hi> for themselves; and so they ought either to keep their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Opinions to themselves, or at least not to vex and disturb the <hi>Publick</hi> by a fierce Endeavour to propagate them to others. And this due Deference to Men's natural Right of <hi>judging</hi> for themselves, hath been always punctually observed in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for it neither damneth, nor censureth, persecuteth, nor destroyeth Men upon the score of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in <hi>Opinion;</hi> provided their <hi>Opinion</hi>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:34683:24"/>
doth not lead them to <hi>wicked,</hi> or <hi>sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous practices;</hi> but hopeth well of all that live well, and receiveth all into its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, that desire it; provided they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve but the Apostles Creed and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the four first General Councils. 'Tis true, it forbideth Men so to <hi>profess</hi> their Dissents to the Articles of its Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Discipline, as to <hi>seduce</hi> her Children from her Communion and list them into Factions against her; and this every Church must necessarily do, that valueth its own <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Preservation:</hi> but it pretendeth not to invade the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of their <hi>Thoughts,</hi> or to lay rigid Restraints on their <hi>Opinions;</hi> and so long as they dissent from us <hi>modestly</hi> and <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,</hi> they may enjoy their own Opinions, and our Communion too. And as for those <hi>Forein Communities</hi> of Christians that differ from us, we pass no severe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences against them; but do believe, and hope, and earnestly pray that the God of all mercies will pity their Errors, and connive at their Defects, and finally unite them to us for ever in the blissful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the <hi>Church Triumphant.</hi> Nor doth our Religion obtrude it self upon the minds of Men, by the bare Warrant of an <hi>imperious Authority;</hi> but fairly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealeth
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:34683:25"/>
to our Understandings, and cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it self upon the tryal of our <hi>Reason;</hi> exacting of us no further Assent, than what the evidence claimeth upon which it is founded; and is so far from exacting of us a <hi>blind-fold Assent</hi> to it without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, that it readily exposeth it self to the severest <hi>Enquiry,</hi> and asketh no other favour but to stand, or fall by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Sentence of our <hi>Reason.</hi> It telleth us both <hi>what</hi> we are to believe, and <hi>why;</hi> and not only <hi>alloweth,</hi> but <hi>requireth</hi> us to examine the grounds and reasons of it; in all which there is not the least Shadow of <hi>imposing</hi> on Men's minds, or usurping on their Rights of <hi>judging</hi> for themselves. But alas! 'Tis not only the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that is guilty of this unnatural <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny:</hi> for how many are there of all Parties among our selves, that cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the least <hi>Contradiction,</hi> but expect all Judgments should bow to <hi>theirs,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>their</hi> imperious Dictates for Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and are ready to <hi>censure</hi> all that dissent from <hi>them</hi> as Men of Reprobate Minds, and to <hi>hate</hi> and <hi>persecute</hi> them, because they cannot believe as fast as <hi>they?</hi> As if no Man had a Right to carry his Eyes in his own Head, but <hi>They;</hi> and <hi>their</hi> Understandings were to be a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:34683:25"/>
                  <hi>Rule,</hi> and <hi>Standard</hi> to the whole World. If another Man differeth from <hi>me,</hi> do not I differ as much from <hi>him?</hi> And hath not He as much Right to judge for himself as I? But He is mistaken, you will say, and I am not; and possibly He is as confident that I am mistaken and not he; and if I think I cannot be mistaken, I am more mistaken than He: but certainly it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Presumption</hi> for him to know <hi>more</hi> than I, nor <hi>Sin</hi> to know <hi>less.</hi> What then is to be done, but to leave one another in the quiet Possession of each others Right; and not to hector and swagger upon every difference in <hi>Opinion;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he that differeth from me, hath as much Right to <hi>judge</hi> for himself as I, though he refuseth to prostrate his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to mine; which for any Man to expect, is a most unjust Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the common <hi>Rights</hi> of Humane Nature.</p>
               <p>III. EVERY Man hath a Right not to be forced, or <hi>impelled</hi> to <hi>act</hi> contrary to the Judgment of right Reason. For right Reason is the <hi>natural Guide</hi> of all reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creatures; 'tis the Light of their feet and the Lanthorn of their paths, and the Star by which they ought to direct their courses. And what can be more
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34683:26"/>
unjust, than to force any Man to act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that which is the <hi>Law</hi> of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? For if He who gave me my Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, gave me right Reason for the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Guide</hi> of it, I must necessarily have an undoubted Right to a full and free per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to <hi>follow</hi> it; otherwise he hath given me a <hi>Law</hi> in vain. And if I have Right to a full permission to follow the <hi>Law</hi> of right Reason, then for any man to impel me to act counter to it either by hope, or fear, or any other motive, is a high <hi>Injustice</hi> to my <hi>Nature.</hi> For he who induceth me to do any wicked, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable Action, which I should not have done, had not he induced me to it, doth in so doing so far as in him lyeth, not permit me to follow the <hi>eternal Laws</hi> of right Reason. As for instance, the Law of right Reason requireth me, when I pretend to give <hi>Evidence</hi> to any matter of Fact, to testifie nothing but the <hi>Truth</hi> to the best of my Knowledge; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who endeavoureth either by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, or threats to suborn me to testifie <hi>falsely,</hi> doth thereby hinder me, so far as in him lyeth, from hearkning to the call of right Reason. Again, right Reason requireth me to make good my <hi>Promises,</hi> whether they be to my Superiors, Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34683:26"/>
or Equals; and much more when I confirm them with an Oath; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who by any means endeavoureth to persuade me to <hi>falsifie</hi> my Word, or Oath, doth in so doing, so far as in him lyeth, not permit me to follow what right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son prescribeth. Once more, right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son commandeth me to bridle my <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite</hi> with Temperance and Sobriety; he therefore that by force, or persuasion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoureth to make me <hi>drunk,</hi> doth to the utmost of his power with-hold and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain me from following that which is the Law of my Nature. In a word, he who by command or threat, promise or persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion putteth me upon any <hi>sinful Action,</hi> is not only guilty in the fight of God of the Sin which I commit by his inducement; but also of doing a high <hi>Injustice</hi> to my Nature, of putting it out of its true biass, and not permitting it to move and act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Laws</hi> of Reason; which is a piece of the most <hi>outragious Violence</hi> that can be offered to a rational Creature. Besides that by inducing another Man to sin, I do, as far as in me lyeth, betray him to eternal <hi>Punishment;</hi> which is as bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous an Injustice to his <hi>Soul,</hi> as the Devil himself can be guilty of. For should I not call that Man a treacherous
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34683:27"/>
Villain, who while he pretendeth to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his Friend, should secretly stab him to the heart? And is it not a much more bloody Villany, under a specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of kindness and good fellowship, to stab my Brother to the <hi>Soul,</hi> and wound him to <hi>eternal Death?</hi> But whilst like a heedless Wrastler, I thus eagerly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give my Brother a fall, it is a thousand to one but I fall with him, and bear him company to <hi>eternal Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. Fourthly and Lastly, EVERY Man hath a <hi>Right,</hi> as he is a reasonable Creature, to be <hi>respected</hi> by every Man, according to the <hi>dignity</hi> of his <hi>Nature.</hi> For as in particular Kingdoms the <hi>King</hi> is the fountain of honour, and every Man under him ought to be respected accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>Degree</hi> of dignity, which the royal Stamp hath imprinted on him; so in the universal Kingdom of the World, <hi>God</hi> is the fountain of honour, and every <hi>Being</hi> under him ought to be treated and respected, according to the <hi>dignity</hi> of its Rank, and suitably to that <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter</hi> of Perfection which <hi>God</hi> hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on its Nature. Since therefore <hi>Man</hi> is so highly advanced by God in the Scale of Beings, as being not only a <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:34683:27"/>
but a <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>immortal</hi> Creature, he hath a Right to be treated as such by all that are of his Class and Order. And for a Man to treat a Man otherwise, is <hi>wrongfully</hi> to depose and degrade him from that noble Rank of <hi>Being</hi> wherein the God of Nature hath placed him. For whatsoever his <hi>outward</hi> Condition may be, I ought to consider him as a <hi>Man,</hi> as One that is placed in the same rank of Being with my <hi>self;</hi> though he be my Slave, or Vassal, I ought to respect him as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual of my <hi>own Kind,</hi> and not use him rudely, harshly or contemptuously like a Dog; though he be poor and mean in his <hi>outward</hi> Circumstances, yet I ought to regard him as a Branch that is sprung out of my <hi>own Stock,</hi> and not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn and despise him as if he were a Creature of an inferior <hi>Species:</hi> though he should be a <hi>Fool,</hi> or a <hi>Mad Man,</hi> yet I ought to respect him as my Brother <hi>Man, i. e.</hi> endowed with the same <hi>Faculties</hi> with my self, though through the unhappy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his bodily <hi>Organs</hi> he cannot exert and exercise them; and not to scorn and deride him, as if he were an <hi>Ape,</hi> or a <hi>Baboon</hi> that seemed to be made on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to be laughed at: yea though (which is worst of all) he should be a <hi>lewd,</hi> or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34683:28"/>
                  <hi>wicked</hi> Man, yet I ought to consider him as a <hi>Stem</hi> of my own <hi>Root;</hi> and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, disdain or vilifie him, as if he were only a two-legged <hi>Brute,</hi> or an upright <hi>Animal.</hi> So that there is a respect that is eternally <hi>due</hi> to Humane Nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is, or whatever disadvantages it is attended with, it is stamped with the Image of God, and that ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced by the whole Creation. And therefore whoever useth a Man inhumanly, affronteth both <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>own Kind,</hi> and violateth the most sacred Rights of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature.</hi> If therefore we would ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to Men their Natural Right and Due, we must take care not to behave our selves <hi>rudely</hi> and <hi>insolently, superciliously</hi> or <hi>contemptuously</hi> towards them; and we must endeavour, as much as in us lyeth, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate our selves to their particular Tempers, and not be <hi>froward</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable,</hi> or tenacious of our own Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, especially when it lyeth in another Man's way; but be apt to recede and give place, that there may be room for other Men's humours, as well as ours. For what reason is there, that our <hi>particular</hi> humour should take up all the World? <hi>We</hi> have no more Right to be morose, or inflexible, than <hi>other</hi> Men; and should
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34683:28"/>
                  <hi>they</hi> be as unyielding as <hi>we,</hi> we must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stand at a perpetual <hi>Bay,</hi> or resolve to justle with every one we meet, till <hi>we</hi> have forced all to give way, or <hi>they</hi> have forced <hi>us.</hi> For whilst we want this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance towards others, we are in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety like irregular Stones in a Building, which are full of roughness and corners, that <hi>take up</hi> more room than they <hi>fill;</hi> and till they are polished, and made even, will not permit others to lye near them. This respect therefore we owe to the humane Nature, which is <hi>common</hi> to all men, to file off that unmanly <hi>sharpness</hi> and <hi>rugged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of humour, which renders us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse and untractable in our Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that so we may be able to compose our selves into such respectful, courteous and obliging Deportment towards all Men, as is due to the <hi>essential Dignity</hi> of humane Nature. And thus you see what Rights are accruing to Men as they are Rational Creatures, and consequently what Acts of <hi>Iustice,</hi> as such, they owe to one another.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of <hi>Justice</hi> in preserving the Rights of Men, as United together by <hi>Natural Relations:</hi> and as joyned together in <hi>Society.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>III. WE will consider Men as Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creatures <hi>united</hi> together by <hi>Natural Relations;</hi> such as Parents and Children, Brothers and Sisters, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguineous Kindred; in which several Relations they have their peculiar <hi>Rights</hi> appertaining to them. Thus <hi>Parents</hi> by giving Nurture and Education to their Children, have a natural <hi>Right</hi> to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and reverenced and obeyed by them; and for <hi>Children</hi> to with-hold these <hi>Dues</hi> from them is not only a foul <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> but a great <hi>Injustice:</hi> they owe their Parents for their Lives and Limbs, for the health of their Bodies and the use of their Faculties; and what a small Composition is there in their <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> for so great a Debt? They borrowed their <hi>Being</hi> from their Parents, and therefore are their natural Subjects,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34683:29"/>
Properties and Pensioners; and to be sure every <hi>Lord</hi> hath a Right to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his <hi>Subject,</hi> every <hi>Owner</hi> to the Disposal of his <hi>Property,</hi> every <hi>Benefactor</hi> to the Love of his <hi>Pensioner;</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every <hi>Parent,</hi> who is <hi>all these</hi> together, to all the Respects and Duties from their <hi>Children.</hi> And so on the other hand, <hi>Children</hi> have a Right to be treated as Children to their <hi>Parents,</hi> that is, as their natural Images and Copies, as parts of their own Substance, as Flesh of their Flesh, and Bone of their Bone, or as <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> derived and multiplyed; which giveth them a natural Right to be dearly beloved and kindly treated, to be fed and cloathed, instructed and provided for by their Parents, according to their <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ability:</hi> and for any Parent not to render these <hi>Dues</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is not only an unnatural <hi>Cruelty,</hi> but a barbarous <hi>Injustice.</hi> And then for Brethren and Sisters and consanguineous Relations, their partaking of the same <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Substance,</hi> as being coined in the same <hi>Mint,</hi> and more immediately derived from the same <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Fountain,</hi> giveth them a natural Right to be <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> beloved, and esteemed, and relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and assisted by one another; and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34683:30"/>
they cannot be unkind, ill-natured, or hard-hearted towards one another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking all the tyes of <hi>Nature,</hi> and being unjust Violators of its <hi>sacred Rights.</hi> These in short are the Rights which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to Men, as <hi>united</hi> together by <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Relations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. Fourthly and Lastly, WE will consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Men as Rational Creatures joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in <hi>Society:</hi> and because <hi>Society</hi> is natural to Men, and that not only as they are Rational Creatures, but as they were always born and bred in <hi>society;</hi> therefore whatsoever Rights accrue to them from hence, may be justly ranked among those Rights which are <hi>Natural.</hi> And Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Nature united in <hi>Society</hi> with one another there doth from thence accrue to us a Right to all that is <hi>necessary</hi> to the obtaining the common Benefits of <hi>Society;</hi> otherwise our being united in Society would be perfectly <hi>insignificant</hi> to us. Now the common Benefit of Society is <hi>mutual Assistance, Comfort,</hi> and <hi>Support;</hi> to the obtaining of which these things are absolutely necessary. First, Love. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Peace. Thirdly, Truth. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Repute. Fifthly, Protection. Sixthly, Communication in the profits of Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. To all which every Man must
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:34683:30"/>
have a Right, by vertue of his being in <hi>Society;</hi> otherwise he is in Society to no purpose. These things I shall but very briefly insist on, because I have handled most of them at large upon another occasion. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Christian Life.</hi> Vol. I.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I. BY vertue of our being united in <hi>Society,</hi> we have a Right to be <hi>beloved</hi> of one another for being all incorporate Members of one Body, we naturally owe each other a <hi>mutual</hi> Sympathy and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling of each other's Pains and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; without which we can never be concerned as we ought to <hi>succour</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> one another. If I <hi>partake</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Joys and Sorrows, it is my Interest to contribute all I am able to his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but unless I am <hi>Partner</hi> in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, it will be indifferent to me whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be happy, or miserable. And as it is <hi>Sympathy</hi> that engageth us to a <hi>mutual Assistance,</hi> so it is <hi>Love</hi> that engageth us to a <hi>mutual Sympathy;</hi> it is <hi>Love</hi> that confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derateth our Souls, and causeth us to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spouse one another's Interests; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so far as we fall short of this, we must necessarily fall short of the end of our <hi>Society,</hi> which is to <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>assist</hi> one another: which we shall never do, unless we are constantly inclined to it by a <hi>mutual</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:34683:31"/>
                  <hi>Benevolence.</hi> But while we hate, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign one another, our being united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Society</hi> will only furnish us with surer means and fairer opportunities to wreak our spite upon each other. So that not to <hi>love</hi> one another while we are thus associated, is not only <hi>uncharitable,</hi> but <hi>unjust;</hi> since we thereby rob one another of one of the most <hi>necessary</hi> means to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the End of our Society. For when Mens <hi>hearts</hi> are divided, 'tis impossible their <hi>hands</hi> should be long united in a <hi>mutual</hi> Defence and Assistance: so that by withdrawing our love from each other, we do, so far as in us lyeth, <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> one another from the common Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of <hi>Society;</hi> which since we have all a Natural Right to, is highly <hi>dishonest</hi> and <hi>injurious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. BY vertue of our being united in <hi>Society,</hi> we have a Right to <hi>Peace;</hi> that is, to live peaceably and quietly our selves, so long as we do not causelesly vex and disturb others. For <hi>Society</hi> being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an <hi>united Multitude,</hi> it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably necessary to the preservation of its Union, that every individual Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber should <hi>quietly</hi> comport himself to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards every one, in that degree and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wherein he is placed; because as the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34683:31"/>
Health of natural Bodies dependeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Harmony of their Parts, so doth the Common Good of Societies, or Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Bodies. It is <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>mutual Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi> which is the Soul that doth both ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and unite Society, and keep its parts from dispersing, and flying abroad into Atoms; which nothing but Force and Violence can hinder them from, when once they are broken, and divided. For he that cannot enjoy his Peace <hi>in</hi> Society, is in a worse condition than if he were <hi>out</hi> of it, and lived in some solitary Desart alone by himself: for there is no <hi>Solitude</hi> so dismal, as a <hi>vexatious</hi> and <hi>quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relsom</hi> Society. Whilst therefore men are of an unpeaceable Temper, and do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to live like <hi>Salamanders</hi> in the Fire of Strife and Contention; they are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Pests,</hi> and <hi>Nuisances</hi> of Society: for wherever they dwell, they lay an Imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go on all sociable Communion, stop all the Inter-changes of good Offices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Men, turn all Conversations into Tragedies, and convert all Societies into Maps, and Images of <hi>Hell,</hi> that black and dismal Region of dark Hatred, fiery Wrath and horrible Tumult. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by the <hi>Fundamental Laws</hi> of Society, every Man hath an undoubted Right, not
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34683:32"/>
to be <hi>disturbed</hi> in the Enjoyment of his innocent <hi>Pleasures,</hi> not to be hindered in the advancing his lawful <hi>Profits,</hi> not to be interrupted in the prosecution of his reasonable <hi>Designs,</hi> not to be detained in his <hi>Afflictions,</hi> or vexed and grieved with causeless <hi>Aggravations</hi> of them; it is the proper business of <hi>Litigious Spirits</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade and overthrow these Rights, and so far as they are able to turn every Man out of the Possession and enjoyment of them. So that they are a <hi>publick offence</hi> and <hi>injury</hi> to Mankind; and ought to be looked upon as so many <hi>Common Barretors</hi> in the World. In short, every Man by vertue of his being in <hi>Society</hi> hath a Right to <hi>Peace,</hi> so long as he demeaneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self justly and peaceably towards others; he therefore that disturbeth another Man's Peace, unless it be in the <hi>defence</hi> of his own, or other Mens <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Peace,</hi> is an Infringer of the <hi>natural</hi> Rights of humane <hi>Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. BY Vertue of our being united in <hi>Society,</hi> we have a Right to <hi>Truth;</hi> that is, we have a Right to know the true sense of each others <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Intentions,</hi> whensoever we pretend to report and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it by our <hi>Speech;</hi> for it is only our <hi>Speech</hi> that capacitateth us for a rational
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34683:32"/>
                  <hi>Society.</hi> Our Words are the <hi>Credentiaries</hi> and <hi>Intelligencers</hi> of the society and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of our minds; and it is only by <hi>these</hi> that Souls do correspond and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their Thoughts to one another: it is by these that they mutually divert their sorrows, and mingle their Mirth; impart their Secrets, communicate their counsels, and make mutual compacts and agreements to supply and assist each other. And indeed <hi>Words</hi> are the <hi>Rudders</hi> that steer all Humane Affairs, the Springs that set the Wheels of Action a going; and the Hands work, the Feet walk, and all the Members and all the Senses act by their direction and impulse; and there is scarce any Communication, or Intercourse among men, but what is transacted by their <hi>Speech.</hi> So that if Men were under no Obligation to express their Thoughts <hi>truly</hi> to one another, there could be no such thing as humane <hi>Society</hi> in the World; for it is impossible their Minds should converse, while their words do falsly <hi>Eccho</hi> and report their Thoughts. In a word, Society and Conversation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great <hi>Bank</hi> and <hi>Exchange</hi> of Souls, <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi> herein is the one pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith of Mankind; which every Man vertually engageth himself to keep,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34683:33"/>
by being and continuing a <hi>Member</hi> of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Society.</hi> For humane Society being a Society of <hi>Minds,</hi> implyeth in the very Nature of it an universal Contract and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement to signifie our Minds <hi>truly</hi> to one another; and therefore since <hi>Words</hi> are the natural Instruments by which this signification is made, every Man by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that Contract hath a Right to have the <hi>true meaning</hi> of every Man's <hi>Mind</hi> in his Words, to have every Man turn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self inside outward to him whensoever he speaketh, and to measure his words by his meaning, and his meaning, so far as he is able, by the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Reality</hi> of things. And therefore whosoever <hi>lieth,</hi> or <hi>equivocateth</hi> to another, by laying Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushes in his words, or lurking behind them in reserved meanings, doth thereby <hi>injuriously</hi> deprive him of the <hi>natural Right</hi> of <hi>Society.</hi> And therefore, by the way, whatsoever the <hi>Romish</hi> Casuists may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, <hi>Equivocation</hi> is as great an Injustice as <hi>Lying;</hi> as being both directed to the same end and purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> to rob those whom we speak to of their <hi>Right</hi> to our meaning and intentions; which he who <hi>equivocateth</hi> doth as effectually, as he that <hi>lyeth</hi> So that in reality an Equivocating <hi>Iesuit</hi> is as great an <hi>Out-law</hi> to Society,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34683:33"/>
as a common <hi>Lyar;</hi> nor can his <hi>ambiguous</hi> words be any more depended on than <hi>false</hi> ones, for the signification of his meaning; but if what he falsly or equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally <hi>affirms</hi> to be his Mind and Meaning, he attesteth with his <hi>Oath;</hi> he doth not only thereby wrong <hi>Man,</hi> but horribly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front <hi>God.</hi> For an <hi>Oath</hi> is a solemn Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of God, to bear Witness to what we <hi>assert,</hi> or <hi>promise;</hi> and therefore if what we assert be false, we call <hi>God</hi> to witness to a <hi>Lye;</hi> which is to suppose ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that there is no God at all, or which is a thousand times worse, that God is as great a Lyar as our selves. For he that calleth God to witness what he saith, must be presumed to believe that God will witness <hi>for him,</hi> and consequently that God will witness falsly; if what he saith be false; which is such a Blasphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the God of <hi>Truth,</hi> as no Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance can sufficiently expiate. And as in the matter of <hi>Assertion</hi> every Man hath a Right to <hi>Truth,</hi> so he hath also in the matter of <hi>Promise;</hi> provided he be promised nothing but what is <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>possible:</hi> and therefore for any Man to promise what he intendeth not to perform, or go back from his promise when he lawfully may, or can perform
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34683:34"/>
it, is an Act of unjust <hi>Rapine:</hi> and I may every whit as honestly rob another of what <hi>is his</hi> without my Promise, as of what I have <hi>made his</hi> by it; he having an <hi>equal Right</hi> to both, by the fundamental Laws of Society. But if he promiseth with an <hi>Oath,</hi> as in matters of publick Trust and Administration we usually do; he doth not only owe a just and punctual Performance unto <hi>Man,</hi> but to <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, whom he calleth to witness that what he sweareth he intendeth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, according to the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> Meaning of his Words: and he solemnly invocateth God to avenge his Non-perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. So that if he fail of what he hath promised by his <hi>Oath,</hi> or doth not execute it according to its true <hi>meaning;</hi> he is guilty not only of a high Injustice to <hi>Man,</hi> but of a horrid Prophanation of the name of <hi>God;</hi> whom he hath solemnly called to witness to a lye, whose Wrath he hath imprecated on his own head, and whose Justice he hath obliged by a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Contract severely to avenge his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</hi> He therefore who <hi>lyeth, equivocateth,</hi> or <hi>forsweareth</hi> himself, whether it be in asserting or promising, violateth that <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Contract</hi> truly to signifie our mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to another, which humane <hi>Society</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:34683:34"/>
and upon which it is founded; and whilst he doth so, there is no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course can be had with him, but he is a Creature by himself, an Enemy to the World, that liveth in a state of war with all Mankind, and out of all Laws and Obligations of humane <hi>Society:</hi> and so whilst he continueth in it, and pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to observe its natural Rights, he doth by his Equivocations, and Lyes wrong and injure all he converseth with.</p>
               <p>IV. BY Vertue of our being united in <hi>Society</hi> we have a Right to <hi>Credit,</hi> and to a fair <hi>Estimation</hi> among one another. For the great end of humane <hi>Society</hi> is, that by their mutual Intercourses Men might <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>assist</hi> one another; and it is for this purpose that Men combine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into <hi>Societies,</hi> that thereby they may enjoy a delightful <hi>Conversation</hi> void of Fear, Suspicion, and Danger; and by <hi>exchanging</hi> their Labours, Counsels, and Commodities may be mutually <hi>helpful</hi> and <hi>beneficial</hi> to one another. And this End no man can ever attain, without having a fair <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Estimation</hi> among those with whom he dealeth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseth: for who will trust to a Man of a <hi>lost Reputation?</hi> Or who would willingly have any Intercourse with one whom he
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34683:35"/>
cannot <hi>trust</hi> and <hi>confide</hi> in? <hi>Credit</hi> is the main Sinew that holdeth <hi>Society</hi> together, and there is scarce any Conversation or Dealing between Man and Man, but what requireth a mutual <hi>Trust,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi> in one another. Since therefore all <hi>Trust</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi> is founded upon <hi>good Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,</hi> every Member of our Society, who hath not <hi>forfeited</hi> his good Name, hath a natural Right to be well-reputed and spoken of; and whosoever either by false <hi>Witness,</hi> publick <hi>Slanders,</hi> or private <hi>Whisperings</hi> endeavoureth to attaint an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Man's Reputation, doth thereby <hi>injuriously</hi> attempt to exclude him from the <hi>Conversation</hi> of Men, and shut the door of humane <hi>Society</hi> against him. And this, how lightly soever it may be thought of, is one of the highest Acts of <hi>Injustice</hi> that one Man can offer to another; for <hi>a good name,</hi> saith Solomon, <hi>is rather to be chosen than great Riches, and loving favour rather than Silver and Gold.</hi> Prov. xxii. 1. And indeed in its consequences it is much more so to every Man; because upon his <hi>good name</hi> his <hi>ability</hi> to do <hi>good</hi> to himself, or friends, or Neighbours, the <hi>Success</hi> of his Affairs, his best <hi>Comforts,</hi> chiefest <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,</hi> and dearest <hi>Conveniencies</hi> of Life, yea and sometimes his <hi>Life</hi> it self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth:
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34683:35"/>
so that in <hi>defaming</hi> of others we commonly <hi>rob,</hi> sometimes <hi>murder,</hi> and always <hi>injure</hi> them; and there are no <hi>damages</hi> so irreparable, no wounds so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, no Scars so indelible as those of a <hi>slanderous Tongue.</hi> For wheresoever its venomous Arrows fall, no eminency of Rank, dignity of Place, sacredness of Office, no innocence of Life, circumspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Behaviour, benignity of Nature and Deportment can protect Men against them; no Force can resist, no Act can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them, no Vindication assoil their mischievous impressions, but still, <hi>aliquid adhaerebit,</hi> let the Innocence they wound be never so well cured, some mark of dishonour will remain. Whosoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either <hi>forgeth,</hi> or <hi>spreadeth,</hi> or rashly <hi>entertaineth</hi> a Slander against any Man, doth in so doing injuriously offend against the <hi>natural Rights</hi> of <hi>Society,</hi> and is at once a Thief, a Ravisher and a Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer; a <hi>Robber</hi> of the good name, a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowrer</hi> of the Reputation, and a <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer</hi> of the Honour of his Neighbour. And yet, Good God, how strangely doth this <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>villanous Practice</hi> prevail in all Societies and Conversations of Men! Among whom it is grown so common to asperse causelesly, that no Man <hi>wondereth</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:34683:36"/>
at it, few <hi>deslike</hi> it, and scarce any <hi>detest</hi> it: but whilst the black-mouthed Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niator is blustering against all that stand in his way, and exhaling his poisonous Breath from his venomous Heart; he is heard not only with <hi>Patience</hi> but with <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and looked upon as a Man of a <hi>notable</hi> Talent, and judged very service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Party</hi> he is engaged in. So that now this odious <hi>Vice</hi> is grown a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shionable Humour, a pleasing <hi>Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> a knack of carrying on some curious feat of <hi>Policy:</hi> and so <hi>Epidemical</hi> is the mischief grown, that it is dangerous for a Man who hath any sense of <hi>Honesty,</hi> or <hi>Iustice,</hi> to come into any Conversation, without being tempted to wish himself sequestered from Society, and to cry out with the Prophet, Jer. ix. 2, 3. <hi>Oh that I had in the Wilderness a lodging place of way-faring Men, that I might leave my people and go from them; for they are an Assembly of treacherous men, and they bend their tongues like a bow for lyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. BY vertue of our being united in <hi>Society,</hi> we have a Right to <hi>Protection</hi> from one another: for it was for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that God brought us forth in a state of <hi>Society,</hi> and linked us to one another by the Inclinations of our Nature; that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:34683:36"/>
so we, who are <hi>singly</hi> a sort of the most <hi>defenceless Creatures,</hi> whom nature hath not furnished either with the defensive, or offensive Armour which is natural to <hi>other</hi> Creatures, might by a <hi>Union</hi> of Forces be able to secure our selves against Forein Outrage and Violence; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>associated</hi> for this end by the Law of our Nature, we are thereby obliged, so far as we are able to <hi>defend</hi> one another. All <hi>Mankind</hi> are One Body, <hi>incorporated</hi> by the Charter of <hi>Nature,</hi> whereby every Member is obliged to stand by and assist his Fellow, so long as he acteth as a <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> and keepeth within the <hi>Rules</hi> of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Society. Whilst therefore I do not by offending others, offend against the Charter of <hi>Nature,</hi> I have a Right to be <hi>defended</hi> by every Man, so far as he hath Power and Opportunity; and whosoever offendeth me, ought to be looked on and proceeded with as a <hi>publick Offender</hi> against the Corporation of <hi>Mankind.</hi> For the <hi>Whole</hi> is concerned in every <hi>Part,</hi> and as he that bruiseth the Toe offendeth the Body, and engageth every Member a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; so he who wrongfully hurteth any <hi>Member</hi> of the Humane <hi>Society,</hi> is thereby injurious to the <hi>Whole,</hi> and ought to be repelled and opposed by <hi>every Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:34683:37"/>
of it: and he who <hi>refuseth</hi> to aid his Fellow-member when injuriously struck at, and it is in his power to defend him, is a <hi>Traytor</hi> to the Common Cause, a <hi>false-hearted</hi> Turn-coat and <hi>base</hi> Deserter of the Society of <hi>Mankind.</hi> He that can patiently sit still, and hear his Brother's <hi>Name</hi> torn in pieces by a slanderous Tongue, when it is in his power to <hi>purge</hi> and <hi>Vindicate</hi> him, robbeth him of the common <hi>Rights</hi> of a Man: he that can see his Brother's <hi>Life</hi> injuriously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, either by open Violence or secret Practice, when it is in his power to <hi>res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue</hi> him, treateth him like an utter <hi>Alien</hi> and <hi>Foreiner</hi> to Mankind: he that can suffer his Brother to be robbed of his <hi>Estate,</hi> or defrauded in his <hi>Property,</hi> when it is in his power to <hi>defend</hi> and <hi>right</hi> him, unjustly with-holdeth from him what he <hi>oweth</hi> him by the Charter of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane <hi>Society;</hi> and in so doing doth not only offend against his <hi>Brother</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, but also against the whole <hi>Society</hi> of which he is a <hi>Part</hi> and <hi>Member.</hi> So that in short, as we are all united by the God of Nature into the same <hi>Corporation,</hi> we are obliged in <hi>Iustice</hi> manfully to <hi>defend</hi> each others Lives, Estates and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and if we <hi>wilfully</hi> permit any Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34683:37"/>
to be murdered, slandered rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed or cozened, when it is in our <hi>power</hi> to prevent it, we do not only wrongfully with-hold from him his natural Right to be <hi>defended</hi> by us, but foully betray the Common Interest of Mankind; for both which we shall one day give a dear Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the supreme Head and Soveraign of all <hi>Societies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. Sixthly and Lastly, BY vertue of our being united in <hi>Society,</hi> we have also a Right to share with one another in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of our <hi>Commerce</hi> and <hi>Intercourse.</hi> For as of all other Creatures we are the best fitted for <hi>Society,</hi> by reason of that <hi>pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar</hi> Faculty we have of communicating our Thoughts and Minds to one another; so of all other Creatures we stand in the greatest <hi>need</hi> of it, by reason of our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency</hi> to supply and relieve our selves. For as for <hi>other</hi> Creatures, after they come into the world, they are much sooner able to help themselves than we; and after <hi>we</hi> are most able to help our selves, there are a world of Necessaries and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies without which we cannot be happy, and with which we cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd without each others <hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</hi> And therefore God created us in <hi>Society,</hi> and imprinted <hi>sociable Inclinations</hi>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:34683:38"/>
on our Natures; that being by them combined and united together, we might be mutually <hi>helpful</hi> to one another, and ready to <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>supply</hi> each other, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our several Talents and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with such necessaries and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of Life as the condition of our nature requireth. This therefore being one <hi>main End</hi> of our Society, <hi>viz.</hi> to be dutiful Ministers of God's Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another, in supplying those wants and necessities which he hath made, and which he hath made to be supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our <hi>mutual</hi> good Offices and Ministries; every Man hath thereupon a <hi>Right</hi> to be aided and assisted by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one with whom he hath any deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or intercourse; and to have some share of the benefit of all that Exchange, Traffick, or Commerce, which passeth between him and others. For every Man hath a Right to his own <hi>Labour,</hi> and <hi>Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry;</hi> and therefore if another be bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by mine, it is but just and equal that I should be benefited by <hi>his;</hi> that he should so exchange <hi>Labour,</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities</hi> with me, as that my Necessities should be served as well as his own; and that while he reapeth what I sow, and enjoyeth the harvest of <hi>my</hi> Labour, he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34683:38"/>
should repay me such a share of <hi>his,</hi> as my Convenience and Necessity calleth for. But if he ingross all the profit of our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change and Commerce to <hi>himself,</hi> he is rather a <hi>Wen</hi> of the Body Politick, that draweth all the nourishment to himself, and starveth the neighbouring Parts; than a regular Member, that contenteth it self with such a share as is proportionate to its own bulk and magnitude, and gladly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth his <hi>Fellow-members</hi> to live and thrive as well as <hi>he.</hi> So that for any Man in his Dealings with others, to take advantage from their <hi>Necessity,</hi> or <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> to oppress or over-reach them; to use them <hi>cruelly,</hi> so as wilfully to dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie them, or <hi>hardly,</hi> so as either to take all the advantage to himself, or not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them such a competent share of it as is necessary to support and maintain them, according to their rank and station; is an injurious Invasion of that <hi>natural Right,</hi> which the very end and design of humane <hi>Society</hi> giveth them.</p>
               <p>AND thus you see what are the <hi>natural Rights</hi> of men, considered as <hi>Rational Creatures</hi> inhabiting <hi>mortal</hi> Bodies, and united to one another by <hi>natural Relations</hi> and <hi>Society;</hi> all which Rights are inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in them <hi>antecedently</hi> to all Humane
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:34683:39"/>
Laws and Constitutions; and though there had never been any other Law but that of Nature, yet they might have justly claimed them of one another, as <hi>Eternal Dues</hi> which no Laws can can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, no Custom dissolve, no Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances make void or abrogate. So that to do justly with respect to Mens <hi>natural Rights,</hi> is to render them what we owe them by the Obligations of <hi>Nature,</hi> as they are Rational Creatures; to treat them <hi>equitably,</hi> to do them all the <hi>good,</hi> we can justly desire they should do to <hi>us,</hi> if we were in their Circumstances; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to permit them to <hi>judge</hi> for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, without endeavouring to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over their Minds by persecuting, censuring, and reviling them, because they are not of our Opinion; to suffer them freely to comply with the Dictates of <hi>right Reason,</hi> and not to put them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by force, command, or presumption upon any <hi>wicked</hi> and <hi>unreasonable Act;</hi> in a word, to pay them all those fair re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects that are due to the dignity of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature,</hi> to treat them Courteously, and Humanly, and not to bespeak or use them as if they were so many Dogs, or brute Animals; these are <hi>Eternal Dues,</hi> which every rational Creature oweth to
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34683:39"/>
his own Kind, and which we cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from one another without high <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi> to humane Nature. But then as we are Rational Creatures inhabiting these <hi>mortal Bodies,</hi> we are obliged in Justice not to maim or destroy or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate one another's bodies; unless it be in the necessary <hi>defence</hi> of our own Lives, Estates, or Liberties; not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive one another of our necessary Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood, and Subsistence; but out of our Abundance to <hi>supply</hi> the pinching Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities of the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Needy.</hi> These things we <hi>owe</hi> one another as we are all the Tenants of God, sent down into this lower World and quartered in these Houses of Clay: and if we rob one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of what we are thus intitled to by the present State and Condition of our Being, we are extremely <hi>unjust</hi> to God and to each other. Again, as we are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creatures united to each other by <hi>natural Relations,</hi> we are obliged to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to each other all those Respects and Duties, which the Nature of our <hi>Relation</hi> calleth for; as we are <hi>Parents,</hi> to love and instruct and make suitable provisions for our <hi>Children;</hi> as we are <hi>Children,</hi> to love and reverence, succour and obey our <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;</hi> as we are <hi>Brethren</hi> or <hi>natural</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:34683:40"/>
                  <hi>Kindred,</hi> to love and honour, succour and relieve one another: and if we with-hold from each other any of these <hi>Rights</hi> or <hi>dues,</hi> which the nature of our Relation calleth for, we make an injurious Inroad upon the most sacred Rights and Inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of <hi>Nature.</hi> Lastly, as we are Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Creatures united to one another by natural <hi>Society,</hi> we owe <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace, Truth</hi> and <hi>Credit, Protection</hi> and <hi>Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation</hi> of Profit to one another. Whilst therefore we hate and malign, and vex and disturb each other; whilst we lye and equivocate, and violate our <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Oaths;</hi> whilst we refuse to <hi>defend</hi> each other's Lives, Estates or Reputation; and <hi>usurp</hi> all the profits of our Exchange and Intercourse, not allowing those whom we deal with a sufficient share to subsist and live by; we trample upon all the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Rights</hi> of humane Society, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean our selves as open Enemies, and Out-Laws to Mankind.</p>
               <p>WHEREFORE in the name of God, if in this degenerate Age, whereinto we are fallen, <hi>Christianity</hi> hath quite lost its just Power and Dominion over us; let us be honest <hi>Heathens</hi> at least, though we resolve to be no longer <hi>Christians:</hi> if we will needs be deaf to the voice of our

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of <hi>Justice,</hi> as it preserves the <hi>Acquired</hi> Rights of Men: and particularly those which arise from Sacred and Civil Relations.</head>
               <p>I PROCEED now to the second sort of <hi>Humane Rights,</hi> which Justice between Man and Man relateth to, <hi>viz.</hi> such as are not Natural to them either as <hi>Rational</hi> Creatures, or as dwelling in <hi>Mortal Bodies,</hi> or as joyned to one another by natural <hi>Relations,</hi> or as naturally united in <hi>Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> but are <hi>acquired</hi> subsequently to the Rights of <hi>Nature,</hi> by that mutual <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> which passeth between Men in their Society with one another. Which Rights though they are not <hi>Natural,</hi> but <hi>Accidental,</hi> are yet founded on the Rights of <hi>Nature,</hi> and therefore ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served as sacredly and as inviolably as <hi>these:</hi> for whatsoever Rights Men do <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi> in the performance of the common Rights of Nature, are <hi>equivalent</hi> with them, as being founded on the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Now all those Rights which are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34683:41"/>
not Natural, are acquired one of these ways; either, First, by <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Relations; or Secondly, by <hi>Legal</hi> Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; or Thirdly, by <hi>Personal</hi> Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments; or Fourthly, by outward <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>Quality;</hi> or Fifthly, by <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining</hi> and <hi>Compact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. THERE are some Rights acquired by <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Relations, and of these there are several sorts.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, There is the Relation of <hi>Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign</hi> and <hi>Subject.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, Of <hi>subordinate</hi> Magistrates to the <hi>Sovereign</hi> and <hi>People.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Thirdly, Of <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>People.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Fourthly, Of <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife.</hi>

                  </item>
                  <item>Sixthly, Of <hi>Masters</hi> and <hi>Servants.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Seventhly, Of <hi>Truster</hi> and <hi>Trustee.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Eightly, Of <hi>Benefactor</hi> and <hi>Receiver.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Ninthly, There is the Relation of <hi>Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> and <hi>Creditor:</hi> of the proper Rights of each of which Relations I shall give as brief an Account as I can.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I. THERE is the Relation of <hi>Sovereign</hi> and <hi>Subject;</hi> which is the highest and most Sacred of all those Relations that are not <hi>natural.</hi> For God being the Supreme Lord and Sovereign of the World, all lawful Power and Authority must be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34683:42"/>
from <hi>him;</hi> for as in particular King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the <hi>King</hi> is the Fountain of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, from whence executive Power descendeth upon <hi>subordinate</hi> Magistrates; so in the universal Monarchy of the World, <hi>God</hi> is the Fountain of all Power and Dominion; from whom all Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Right of Government descendeth upon <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Governours;</hi> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever exerciseth Dominion in the World without <hi>Divine</hi> Authority, is an <hi>Usurper</hi> in the Kingdom of God. But then the Derivation of this Authority from Him is either <hi>immediate,</hi> or <hi>mediate;</hi> those who are supreme under Him derive their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <hi>immediately</hi> from Him, and are the <hi>Channels</hi> by whose Mediation he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riveth Authority to their <hi>subordinate</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates; so that the <hi>subordinate</hi> Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of particular Kingdoms derive their Authority from <hi>God</hi> by the hands of their <hi>Kings,</hi> but the Kings themselves derive theirs from God's own hands <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately:</hi> and whatever the particular form of any Government be, whether it be <hi>Monarchy,</hi> or <hi>Polyarchy,</hi> that which is <hi>supreme</hi> in it under God must be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from him. So far from true is that modern Maxim of some Jesuited Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticians, <hi>viz. That Civil Government is the</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:34683:42"/>
                  <hi>Peoples Creature;</hi> which by necessary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence excludeth <hi>God</hi> from being the supreme Governor of the World: for if He be absolutely Supreme, there is none can be Supreme immediately under Him, but by an Authority derived <hi>immediately</hi> from him. So that the Relation of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> hath this Right unalienably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant to it, <hi>to be accountable to none but God;</hi> from whom alone it holdeth its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to whom alone it is subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. And therefore for <hi>Subjects</hi> to call their <hi>Sovereign</hi> to account, is both to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign God's Authority, and to invade his <hi>Peculiar;</hi> to set our selves down in his Throne, and summon his Authority before us, and require it to submit its <hi>awful</hi> Head to our Doom and Sentence: which is as high and impious an Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, as can be offered either to God, or Man; and (till <hi>Popery,</hi> that fardle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Impostures, set <hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> abroach) as abhorrent to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Principles,</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> as Hell is to Heaven, or Darkness to Light. But then since Sovereigns are God's <hi>Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> and do Reign by his Authority, they have also an inseparable <hi>Right</hi> to be <hi>obeyed</hi> in all things, wherein they do not interfere with the Commands of God;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34683:43"/>
for in obeying <hi>them</hi> we obey <hi>God,</hi> who commandeth by their Mouths, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth by their Laws, and Edicts: and as he who refuseth to obey the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, doth in so doing disobey the <hi>King</hi> himself, unless he commandeth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; so he who disobeyeth his <hi>Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign</hi> who is God's Vice-Roy, doth in so doing disobey <hi>God,</hi> unless it be where God hath countermanded him. So that while he commandeth only lawful things, he hath an <hi>undoubted Right</hi> to be obeyed; because his Commands are stamped with Divine Authority, and are thereby ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered sacred, and inviolable. Again, since Sovereigns are the <hi>supreme Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives</hi> of God's Power and Majesty upon Earth, as being his <hi>immediate</hi> Substitutes; they have also an <hi>unalienable Right</hi> to be <hi>honoured,</hi> and <hi>reverenced</hi> by their Subjects, because they bear God's Character, and do shine with the Rays of his Majesty; before which every Creature in Heaven and Earth ought to bow and lye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; and therefore for Subjects to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn</hi> and <hi>vilifie</hi> their Sovereigns, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose their faults and uncover their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Lampoon and Libel their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Actions, is an Affront to <hi>God's</hi> own Majesty, and an unjust and impious
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34683:43"/>
                  <hi>Prophanation</hi> of that Divine Character they bear about them. Once more; since Sovereigns are substituted by God for the <hi>Common Good,</hi> to protect the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and avenge the Injured, and guard the Rights of their People against For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign and Intestine Fraud and Violence; they must hereupon have an undoubted Right to be <hi>aided</hi> and <hi>assisted</hi> by their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; because without their Aid, it will be impossible for them to accomplish the <hi>Ends</hi> of their Sovereignty. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for Subjects to <hi>refuse</hi> to Aid their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign with their Purses, or Persons, when legally required; or by any indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect means to <hi>withdraw</hi> themselves from his Assistance, whenever his Necessities call for it, is to detain from him a <hi>just Right</hi> that is owing to his Character and Relation. And as these Rights are all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the Relation of a <hi>Sovereign,</hi> so are there others implyed in the Relation of a <hi>Subject:</hi> for Sovereign Power being ordained by God for a <hi>publick Good,</hi> to guard and defend the Innocent, to shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and relieve the Oppressed, to fence and propagate true Religion, and adjust and ballance private Rights and Interests; Every <hi>Subject</hi> hath a Right to be <hi>protected</hi> by it, so far as it is able, in his Person
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34683:44"/>
and Legal Rights, in his <hi>just</hi> Liberties and Privileges, and sincere Profession of <hi>true</hi> Religion; and that Sovereign who doth not employ his power to these pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, but through wilful and affected Error, or Ignorance imposeth a <hi>false</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion on his People; or betrayeth, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth, or inslaveth them himself, or permits others to do it either out of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, or Carelesness, is an <hi>injurious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader</hi> of their Rights and Properties; and though he be not accountable to any Earthly Tribunal, shall one day an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer for it at the Tribunal of God.</p>
               <p>II. THERE is the Relation of <hi>Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate Magistrates</hi> to the <hi>Sovereign</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> such are the Judges and Justices, the Governours of Towns, Cities and Provinces, and the like; who by vertue of that Authority which is stamped up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and which they derive, as I told you, from God, who is the Head and Spring of all Power and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have by vertue of that a Right to be <hi>honoured</hi> and <hi>reverenced</hi> and <hi>obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by the People according to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and extent of their Authority. For wherever it is placed, <hi>Authority</hi> is a Sacred thing; as being a Ray, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press of the Divine Majesty, and as
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34683:44"/>
such may justly claim <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> from all Men; and whoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth the <hi>lowest</hi> Degree of it; offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an Affront to the <hi>highest.</hi> He who contemneth <hi>Subordinate</hi> Magistrates who are vested with the King's Authority, doth therein contemn the <hi>King;</hi> and he who contemneth the <hi>King,</hi> who is vested with God's Authority, doth therein contemn <hi>God.</hi> Whatsoever therefore the personal faults and defects of Magistrates may be, Men ought to consider that their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is a Sacred thing, and, as such, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth their <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> by an unalienable Right; and that therefore to behave themselves frowardly, stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly, or irreverently towards a lawful Magistrate, is to detain from him his <hi>Rights,</hi> and offer an unjust Affront to his Character; which, how good soever they may be in other Instances, doth in this bespeak them highly <hi>dishonest</hi> and <hi>injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> And as the Relation of <hi>Subordinate</hi> Magistrates intitleth them to the Peoples <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> so the Relation which the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People</hi> bear to them, intitleth them both to their <hi>Fidelity, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance</hi> and <hi>Iustice.</hi> For Subordinate Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates are the King's <hi>Trustees</hi> for himself and his People; and in their hands he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34683:45"/>
depositeth the Honour, Security and Rights of his own Crown and Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, together with the Safeguard and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Just and Legal Rights of his People. So that upon their acceptance of this <hi>Trust,</hi> by which they engage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves faithfully to discharge it, the King acquireth a <hi>Right</hi> to their faithful and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant <hi>Care,</hi> to see that his Authority be <hi>Reverenced,</hi> his Laws <hi>Obeyed,</hi> his Person, Government, and Properties <hi>Secured;</hi> the People acquire a Right to be <hi>Protected</hi> by them in their Persons, Reputations, Liberties and Estates; and so far as they are wilfully failing either towards the King, or the People, in any of these Matters, they do <hi>unjustly</hi> detain the King's or the Peoples <hi>Rights,</hi> or both; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the <hi>Trust</hi> committed to them, falsifie their own <hi>Engagements,</hi> and under the <hi>Mask</hi> of Authority are publick Robbers of Mankind.</p>
               <p>III. THERE is the Relation of <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>People:</hi> for since out of his tender care to the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men, God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted an <hi>Order</hi> of Men to Administer to them those holy Ordinances, by which he conveyeth his Grace and Spirit, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them in their Duties, admonish them of their Errors, and warn them of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:34683:45"/>
their Dangers, and guide them to <hi>eternal Happiness;</hi> there doth from hence arise a near and <hi>sacred Relation</hi> between the <hi>People,</hi> and their respective <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Pastors.</hi> They are joined together by the Tyes and Obligations of <hi>Religion,</hi> which giveth them a mutual Right in one another; and which giveth the <hi>Pastor</hi> a Right to be diligently <hi>attended</hi> to by the <hi>People</hi> in his religious Ministrations, to be Construed in the best Sense, and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated and complyed with in all his pious Reproofs and Admonitions, to be honoured and reverenced for his <hi>Work's</hi> sake, to partake with the People in their <hi>Temporals,</hi> as they do with him in his <hi>Spirituals,</hi> and to be supported by them, according to their Ability, with a fair and honourable <hi>Maintenance;</hi> and they who are wanting to their <hi>Pastor</hi> in any of these particulars, deprive him of that which is as much his <hi>Right</hi> in <hi>Conscience,</hi> as any thing can be theirs in <hi>Law.</hi> And then as for the <hi>People,</hi> They have also a Right to have <hi>holy Things</hi> duly and regularly Administred to them by their <hi>Pastor,</hi> to be taught and instructed by him with wholsome Doctrine and Example, to be prudently admonished of their Faults and Dangers, and counselled and advised by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34683:46"/>
him in all their <hi>spiritual</hi> Straits and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igencies; and he who is wilfully failing in the faithful discharge and payment of these <hi>Dues</hi> is a Thief and a Robber of his Peoples <hi>Souls;</hi> that so far as in him lyeth, rifleth them of that which ought to be dearer to them than their Estates, or Lives, even the <hi>Bread of Life,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which they cannot live, but must starve and perish for ever; and if they do, it is by his <hi>unjust Neglect</hi> to render them their Dues, and their Blood will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at his hands.</p>
               <p>IV. THERE is the Relation of <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> who having mutually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed themselves upon each other, and sealed the Deed by <hi>Matrimonial Vow,</hi> are thereby interwoven into one another and morally compounded into one Person. For <hi>Marriage</hi> is an Union of Persons, an Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of two into one by moral Ties and Ligaments; so that between <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> and <hi>Wife</hi> there is the nearest and dearest Union that can be between two natural Persons; they are each others <hi>Property</hi> and <hi>Inclosure,</hi> having by mutual Vows made over and exchanged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for one another; by vertue of which they have a <hi>mutual</hi> Right in each others Person, and cannot bestow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:34683:46"/>
away from one another, without being guilty of the most outragious <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.</hi> For the Husband is one half of the Wife, and the Wife of the Husband; and therefore whenever they <hi>alienate</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from each other, they rob one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of one half of themselves. And it is this that doth so much inhance the sin of <hi>Adultery,</hi> beyond that of simple <hi>Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> because when the Husband dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth his Body to another Woman, or contrariwise, he is not only guilty of an unbounded, rambling <hi>Lust,</hi> which is the proper malignity of simple Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but also of a foul and monstrous <hi>Injustice.</hi> For he having made himself his <hi>Wife's</hi> by Promise and Vow, cannot give away himself from her without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impiously <hi>injurious,</hi> without robbing God of his Vow, and robbing her of himself, for whom she exchanged her self. And consequently they who endeavour to <hi>seduce</hi> the Wife from the Husband, or the Husband from the Wife, are guilty of a horrid <hi>Injustice,</hi> in attempting to rob God and Man of that which is most dear and pretious to them, and to break through Vows and Sacred Fences to Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass on their Neighbour's Inclosure; which how common soever it may be in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:34683:47"/>
this degenerate Age, is certainly one of the blackest <hi>Villanies</hi> in Nature. And as Husband and Wife have a <hi>mutual Right</hi> to each other's <hi>Persons,</hi> so they have also to each other's dearest <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Affection:</hi> for there is no Relation doth so nearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title and interest Persons in one another, as that of <hi>Marriage;</hi> nor consequently, that giveth them so great a Right and Title to each other's Hearts and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Mat. xix. 5. <hi>For this cause shall a Man leave Father and Mother, and shall cleave to his Wife, and they two shall be one flesh;</hi> and then <hi>no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it,</hi> saith the Apostle exhorting to Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Love, <hi>Eph.</hi> v. 29. Husband and Wife are <hi>one</hi> by a moral Union of Persons, and therefore for them to hate and abuse <hi>one another</hi> would be as unnatural, as for a Man to hate and tear his <hi>own flesh.</hi> Again, as they have a mutual Right to each others <hi>Persons</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> so they have also to each others <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:</hi> hence the Apostle calleth them <hi>Yoak-fellows,</hi> implying, that they ought to draw <hi>together,</hi> and <hi>mutually</hi> assist one another in their common Concerns and Interests. For in the union of their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> their <hi>Interest</hi> is combined and united;
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:34683:47"/>
so that <hi>that</hi> which is the one's is the other's: their <hi>Meums</hi> and <hi>Tuums</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded together, and their Fortunes make a common Stock wherein they are <hi>Partners</hi> with one another, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to the promiscuous use and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. And being Sharers in the same Interest, they ought to be mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>helpful</hi> and bear a part of each others <hi>Cares</hi> and <hi>Burdens:</hi> for when they are both intitled to the <hi>same</hi> Fortunes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, it is by no means just, that the one like a slothful Drone should dwell at ease in the Hive and devour the Hony, whilst the other like a laborious Bee goeth forth and toileth to gather it. These are the common <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Dues,</hi> which Husband and Wife owe to one another: but then the <hi>Husband</hi> having the Superiority, hath a Right to be <hi>reverenced</hi> and <hi>obeyed</hi> by his <hi>Wife</hi> in all things that are fair and honest, to be entertained with a gentle Behaviour, addressed to with soft Entreaties, and treated with a sweet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance; and therefore for a Woman to behave her self <hi>perversly</hi> towards her Husband, to controul his will in indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent matters, and if he will not yield, to teaze and weary him with her sour Looks, or clamorous Words, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:34683:48"/>
Deportment, is not only a great <hi>Dishonour</hi> to her own Head, but a high and shameful <hi>Injustice,</hi> for which she must one day account to God, as well as for other <hi>Iniquities.</hi> And then on the other hand, the <hi>Wife</hi> being no otherwise <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> to the <hi>Husband,</hi> than the <hi>Body</hi> is to the <hi>Soul,</hi> or the Bosom to the Head, ought not to be treated by him as his <hi>Slave</hi> and <hi>Servant,</hi> but as a part of <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, i. e.</hi> with all lenity and forbearance, tenderness and complaisance: and as <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith, <hi>the Husband's Empire over the Wife ought to be soft and chearful,</hi> to be allayed and sweetned with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Condescension and Officiousness: and that <hi>Soul</hi> is not more unrighteous to its <hi>Body,</hi> that starveth, or macerateth, or evil intreateth it; than the Husband is to his Wife, who behaveth himself <hi>churlishly, sourly</hi> or <hi>imperiously</hi> towards her. <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 19. <hi>Husbands love your Wives,</hi> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>and be not bitter against them, i. e.</hi> be not morose and rough, stern and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in your Carriage towards them; but be sure you use them with all that honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Regard,</hi> prudent <hi>Compliance</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing <hi>Familiarity,</hi> that is <hi>due</hi> to them as they are parts of <hi>Your Selves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:34683:48"/>V. THERE is the Relation of <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Friend,</hi> which I put next to that of <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> because it is next to it in respect of Nearness and Affinity. For <hi>Friendship</hi> is the Marriage of <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Interests</hi> and <hi>Counsels,</hi> the Union or Exchange of Hearts, the Clasp of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Affections, or true Love-knot that tyeth Mens Hearts and Minds together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for as for the <hi>Matter</hi> of Friendship, it is Love and Charity; but as for the <hi>Form</hi> of it, it is Charity <hi>appropriated</hi> to such particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Persons; so that Charity is Friendship in <hi>common,</hi> and Friendship is Charity <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed.</hi> In a word, Charity is Friendship <hi>expanded,</hi> like the force of the Sun when he riseth above the Horizon and shineth upon all the World; but Charity is Friendship <hi>contracted,</hi> like the Rays of that glorious Light drawn into the Center of a Burning-glass, and made more warm and active by their Union. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men have contracted particular <hi>Friendships,</hi> and espoused their Souls and Minds to one another, there doth from thence arise a <hi>new Relation</hi> between them beyond what common Charity createth; from which <hi>new Relation</hi> there accrue <hi>new Rights</hi> to the related Parties. For <hi>mutual</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:34683:49"/>
                  <hi>Friendship</hi> is not a Metaphysical Nothing, created merely for <hi>Contemplation,</hi> for such as are contracted in its holy Bands to stare upon each other's Faces and make Dialogues of News and Prettinesses, or to look Babies in one another's Eyes; but a substantial and important <hi>Vertue</hi> that is fitted for the noblest purposes, to be an Alloy to our <hi>sorrows,</hi> an Ease to our <hi>Passions,</hi> a Discharge of our <hi>Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> a Sanctuary to our <hi>Calamities,</hi> a Counsellor of our <hi>Doubts,</hi> a Repository of our <hi>Secrets,</hi> and an Improvement of our <hi>Meditations;</hi> a Champion to our <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,</hi> and an Advocate for our <hi>Interest</hi> both with God and Men; to these brave Purposes serveth every real <hi>Friendship,</hi> and without these it is only the empty <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Shadow</hi> of Friendship. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men combine and unite together in this close and near <hi>Relation,</hi> they give each other a Right to themselves to all the above-named <hi>Uses</hi> and <hi>Purposes,</hi> to be <hi>Guides</hi> and <hi>Comforts</hi> to each other in their Doubts and Sorrows, <hi>Monitors</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers</hi> in their Errors and Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Shelters</hi> and <hi>Refuges</hi> in their Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Calamities, and faithful <hi>Trustees</hi> and <hi>Secretaries</hi> to each other's Confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:34683:49"/>
and Thoughts. These are the great <hi>Rights</hi> of Friendship, which whosoever detaineth or with-holdeth from his Friend is a <hi>false,</hi> and <hi>unjust</hi> Correspondent in that brave and noble <hi>Relation:</hi> For when we mutually contract particular Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships with one another, it is to <hi>these</hi> great purposes, or it is not <hi>Friendship:</hi> and when to <hi>these</hi> purposes we have once joyned hands, and struck particular A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities with one another, we are bound by the tyes of common <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> so far as we are able, to make good our Contract to all those Intents and Purposes it extendeth to.</p>
               <p>VI. THERE is the Relation of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> and <hi>Servants:</hi> for between Master and Servant there are <hi>mutual Engagements,</hi> which are either expressed in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, or implyed in their Relation; and whether there be any formal Contract between them, or no, their very <hi>Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is an implicit Bargain, and supposeth a mutual Engagement to one another. By being a <hi>Servant</hi> to another, I put my self into his hands and disposal, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote my Time and Pains and Labour to him; by vertue of which he acquireth a just <hi>Right</hi> to my time and service, my fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and chearful Obedience: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:34683:50"/>
if either by Gaming, Loitering or Company-keeping, I alienate my <hi>Time</hi> from him; or if by my Sloth and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness I rob him of my <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Labour,</hi> or by my hypocritical Eye-service, or betraying his Trusts, or wasting or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezzeling his Goods, I deprive him of my <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Fidelity;</hi> or if lastly by my Stubborness and Obstinacy I purloin from him my <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> I am a <hi>dishonest</hi> and <hi>unjust</hi> Servant; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I may escape now, must one day ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to give an Account to my Just and All-seeing Master in Heaven. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in Scripture Servants are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to <hi>obey their Masters in all things,</hi> Col. iii. 22. And <hi>to do service to them with good will.</hi> Eph. vi. 7. To serve them with <hi>singleness of heart,</hi> not to purloin their Goods, or answer them again in a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and surly manner, <hi>Tit.</hi> ii. 9, 10. Since then they stand obliged to these Duties both by Precept of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the natural Engagement of their <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> it is plain they cannot act contrary thereunto, without openly transgressing the Laws of <hi>God,</hi> and trepassing on the Rights of <hi>Men.</hi> And so on the other hand, by being a <hi>Master</hi> to another, I stand engaged to <hi>maintain</hi> and <hi>protect</hi> him
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34683:50"/>
in my service, to pay him the Wages, or teach him the <hi>Trade</hi> for which he serveth me; not to out-task his Ability, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any thing on him but what is <hi>tolerable</hi> and <hi>merciful;</hi> to Correct him with gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, prudence and mercy, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain him too rigidly from fitting and healthful <hi>Recreation:</hi> and above all, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish him of his <hi>Faults,</hi> instruct him in his <hi>Duty,</hi> and give him all chearful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to <hi>Well-doing.</hi> For I ought to consider, that I am Master of a <hi>Man</hi> of the same kind with my self, that hath Right upon that account to be treated <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manely;</hi> which if I do not instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a just <hi>Master,</hi> I am a savage <hi>Tyrant:</hi> and also I should consider that I am Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of an <hi>immortal Man,</hi> who upon that account hath a Right to be treated <hi>religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,</hi> that hath a Soul to be saved, and an eternal Interest to be secured; which if I take no care of, I treat him rather as my <hi>Dog,</hi> than my <hi>Servant,</hi> as a Beast that <hi>perisheth,</hi> than as a Man that is to <hi>live</hi> for ever. So that if any of these ways I am wanting to my Servant, I am a <hi>Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> of that Rule of Righteousness that is founded in my Relation to him; and though the crying Necessities of his Soul and Body cannot penetrate my Ears, nor
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34683:51"/>
move <hi>my</hi> Adamantine Bowels to a more <hi>just</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> Treatment; yet the Cry of those Wrongs and Injuries I do him by my unjust, inhumane and irreligious Usage, will certainly penetrate the Ears of <hi>God,</hi> and provoke his Vengeance to a dire <hi>Retribution</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>VII. THERE is the Relation of <hi>Trustees</hi> to those that trust them: for he who trusteth another doth thereby create a very near and intimate Relation to him; so far forth as he trusteth him, he putteth his case in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, and depositeth his Interest in his Disposal, and thereby createth him his Proxy, or his <hi>second self.</hi> So that when I accept of the Trust that another offereth me, whether it be to be an <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator</hi> in his Cause, or an <hi>Executor</hi> of his Will, or a <hi>Guardian</hi> to his Children, or a <hi>Keeper</hi> of any <hi>Pledge</hi> or <hi>Depositum</hi> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth to me, I do thereby enter into a close Alliance and Relation with him; I put on his Person, engage to supply his place, to act as his Representative, or <hi>alter ego,</hi> and so far as he trusteth and confideth in me, to do for him as if the case were <hi>my own,</hi> to determine his Cause, to execute his Will, and dispose of his Children, and secure his Pledges to him as if I were <hi>himself,</hi> and those were all
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34683:51"/>
                  <hi>my own.</hi> And by entring into this near Relation to him, I give him a Right so far forth as he intrusteth me, to my <hi>Skill</hi> and <hi>Care, Fidelity</hi> and <hi>Industry;</hi> all which by putting on his Person I have listed and engaged in his Service. So that if by my own <hi>Carelesness</hi> or <hi>Neglect</hi> I suffer any of his Trusts to miscarry, I am highly <hi>dishonest</hi> and <hi>injurious</hi> to him; because I undertook to do for him all that I can suppose <hi>he</hi> would have done for <hi>himself,</hi> had he been Master of my Skill and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. But if for a Bribe, or to serve my Interest, I betray the <hi>Trust</hi> he committed to me, or convert it to my own Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; I rob him more <hi>basely</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famously,</hi> than if I bad him stand, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Purse upon the High-way. For then I had robbed him in the person of an <hi>Enemy,</hi> but now I rob him in his <hi>own,</hi> and make use of that Trust to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray</hi> his Interest, by which I was as much obliged to <hi>secure</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> it, as if I had exchanged Persons with him, and his Interest were my own: and to <hi>betray</hi> his Interest for my own Advantage, when he had made me his <hi>second Self,</hi> and I had engaged my self to be so, is a piece of the most <hi>inhumane</hi> and <hi>disingenuous</hi> Persidiousness and Injustice; because by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:34683:52"/>
thus doing I abuse his good Opinion of me, for which I stand obliged to him, into an occasion of <hi>betraying</hi> him. So that in effect I have borrowed his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which he freely lent me, only to <hi>rob</hi> and <hi>despoil</hi> him; and from his confidence in my Truth and Fidelity, by which he was justly intitled to it, have <hi>basely</hi> taken occasion to defraud him of that <hi>Trust,</hi> which he freely deposited in my hands and disposal.</p>
               <p>VIII. THERE is the Relation of the <hi>Benefactor</hi> to the <hi>Receiver:</hi> for he who doth good to another, doth thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a Relation to him; because in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to him he espouseth his Interest, and in espousing his Interest he espouseth himself: he performeth the part of his Brother, of his Father, and his God, whose highest Character and <hi>Elogium</hi> is to <hi>be good</hi> and to <hi>do good;</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all these Capacities he standeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to him. And by vertue of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation he acquireth a Right in the Person obliged, to be <hi>esteemed</hi> and <hi>beloved</hi> by him; to be pray'd for and requited by him whenever he hath opportunity, and ability. For there is always a Right ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by <hi>Benefits,</hi> where there was none antecedently: he who doth a good turn,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:34683:52"/>
deserveth and meriteth of him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth it; and what he deserveth, he hath a Right to. So that every Receiver is <hi>Debtor</hi> to his Benefactor; he <hi>oweth</hi> him all the good he receiveth from him; and is always <hi>obliged</hi> to a thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, and whenever he hath oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to an equivalent Requital. For though my Benefactor <hi>giveth</hi> me his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit freely, as having no need of it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, or at least not so much as I, and therefore cannot legally demand a <hi>Repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of it; yet whatsoever he <hi>giveth</hi> me, he <hi>deserveth</hi> of me, and whenever our Circumstances change and he hath <hi>my</hi> Need, and I <hi>his</hi> Ability, I am in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as much obliged to repay it, as if he had lent it me upon Bond. In this case my Ability is <hi>Security</hi> for the Benefit I owe him, and his Need is a just <hi>Demand</hi> of it; and therefore since what he hath me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited of me is his <hi>Due,</hi> I am extremely unjust, if when his Needs do demand it, I do not repay him so far as I am able. But if either I am not able to repay him an equivalent Benefit, or he hath no need or occasion for it; I am bound in justice to express my <hi>Gratitude</hi> to him in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Remembrances and Acknowledments, to take all fair Occasions to own and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:34683:53"/>
his goodness, and by all the little services I can render him to express a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>willingness</hi> to make him a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital. For as in matter of <hi>Debt,</hi> he who cannot pay <hi>all</hi> must Compound and pay so far as he is <hi>able;</hi> so in the matter of <hi>Benefits,</hi> he who cannot make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Requital, is obliged in justice to make some small <hi>Composition,</hi> and pay so much in the <hi>pound</hi> as his Ability extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to; and if he can do no more, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press a <hi>grateful Sense</hi> of them, and give thankful <hi>Words</hi> for beneficial <hi>Deeds;</hi> which all generous Benefactors esteem the <hi>noblest Requital.</hi> But he who receiveth Benefits without some thankful Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, acteth the part of a <hi>Swine,</hi> that greedily devoureth the Acrons, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver looketh up towards the Tree from whence they drop: and he who requiteth Benefits with Injuries, acteth the part of a <hi>Devil,</hi> that would fain have thrown that blessed Being out of Heaven, who created and placed him in it.</p>
               <p>IX. Ninthly and Lastly, THERE is the Relation of <hi>Creditor</hi> and <hi>Debtor:</hi> for he who lendeth to another Man, and giveth him Credit either for Mony or Commodities, or accepteth of his Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for what he lendeth to another, doth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:34683:53"/>
thereby contract a Relation to him; by which he acquireth a Right to be justly <hi>repay'd</hi> according to Contract and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For lending and crediting doth not alienate the <hi>Property;</hi> the Debtor hath only a Right to use what he borroweth for his present <hi>Convenience</hi> or <hi>Necessity,</hi> but the Property remaineth in the hands of the <hi>Creditor,</hi> who hath the same Right to it as when it was in his own Possession. And it being so, the Rule of <hi>Common Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> obligeth us that we do not borrow more than we have a fair Prospect of <hi>Repaying;</hi> unless he that crediteth us <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> our Inability, and is willing to run the hazard. For he who engageth himself in Debt beyond what he can reasonably hope to <hi>repay,</hi> taketh that from his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor upon promise of Payment, which he knoweth he is never likely to <hi>restore</hi> him; which is at least as high an <hi>Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> as if he had taken it by <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Violence.</hi> And the same is to be said of borrowing upon <hi>false</hi> or <hi>insufficient</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities, such as bad Mortgages, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Pawns, or insolvent Bonds-men: for he who taketh up his Neighbour's Goods or Mony upon such Securities, as he knoweth are incapable of <hi>repaying</hi> him, doth as manifestly wrong him, as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34683:54"/>
if he had taken them by <hi>Stealth,</hi> or <hi>Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery.</hi> And since our Debts are our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor's Rights, if we would be just Debtors, we must neither reckon what we owe to be our own; nor so dispose of it, as to put it out of our Power to restore it to the true <hi>Proprietor:</hi> he that hath so much of his own, and so much of other mens, ought not to spend, or give, as if it were all his own. For if he that hath borrowed one Thousand Pounds, and is worth another, liveth to the utmost height and proportion of two Thousand, he must necessarily spend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what he hath borrowed, and put it out of his power to restore it; and in so doing <hi>rob</hi> and <hi>despoil</hi> his Creditor, to maintain himself in his <hi>Prodigality.</hi> And as Debtors ought to be careful so to dispose of what they owe, as that they may be able to <hi>repay</hi> it; so they ought to be no less careful to repay it upon due <hi>Demand,</hi> or according to <hi>Contract</hi> and <hi>Agreement.</hi> For as it is unjust to deprive a Creditor of his <hi>Mony,</hi> so it is unjust to deprive him of the <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Possession</hi> of it, any <hi>longer</hi> than he consenteth and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth to it: because as he hath Right to his Mony, so he hath Right to possess and use it. And therefore for Debtors to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:34683:54"/>
                  <hi>defer</hi> and <hi>protract</hi> their payments without their Creditors Consent, when it is in their power to discharge them, to put them upon fruitless Attendances, and make advantages of their mony against their consent, and beyond their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts</hi> and <hi>Agreements,</hi> is a degree of Injustice next to that of Robbing and <hi>despoiling</hi> them of it; because by thus doing they do not only force their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors to waste their <hi>time</hi> in tedious At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendances and take them off from their other businesses, but also rob them of the <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Possession</hi> of their Mony; which they have as much Right to, as to the Mony it self. And if to defer Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be so unrighteous in a Debtor, then to <hi>refuse</hi> and <hi>deny</hi> it, or take indirect courses either to <hi>abate,</hi> or <hi>avoid</hi> it, is much more unrighteous: because this is not only to deprive a Creditor of the present <hi>Use</hi> and <hi>Possession</hi> of his Property, but of his <hi>Property</hi> too; and how can that Man call any thing he possesseth his <hi>own</hi> Right and Property, whilst he thus deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another <hi>his?</hi> So that by an indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rule of Justice, every Debtor is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged rather to strip himself of all, and cast himself naked on the <hi>Providence</hi> of God; than by <hi>denying</hi> his Debts, or indirectly
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:34683:55"/>
                  <hi>shifting</hi> the payment of them, to Feather his Nest with the Spoils of his <hi>Neighbour.</hi> When therefore by <hi>refusing</hi> to pay what we owe, we force our Creditors upon costly, or troublesome <hi>Suits</hi> to recover their own; or by pleading <hi>Protections,</hi> or sheltring our selves in a <hi>Prison,</hi> we avoid being forced to it by Law; or by fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Breakings,</hi> we necessitate them to Compound our Debts, and accept a Part for the Whole; which soever of these ways we take, I say, to deprive our Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors of their Rights, we are inexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>dishonest,</hi> and <hi>unrighteous.</hi> And though by these, or such like <hi>knavish Evasions,</hi> we may force them to acquit and discharge us, yet we cannot force <hi>God,</hi> in whose Book of Accounts our Debts are <hi>recorded,</hi> as well as in <hi>theirs;</hi> and it concerneth us sadly to consider, that there is nothing can cross, or cancel them <hi>there,</hi> but only a full <hi>Restitution;</hi> and that if they are not cancelled <hi>there,</hi> all the Tricks and Evasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the World will never be able to secure us from a dismal <hi>Reckoning,</hi> and a more dismal <hi>Execution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND thus you see what those acquired Rights are which are due from Man to Man upon account of their <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Sacred</hi> Relations.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of <hi>Justice,</hi> as it preserves the Rights of Men acquired by <hi>Legal Possession.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>II. THERE are other Rights acquired by <hi>Legal Possession.</hi> For when there was but <hi>one</hi> Man, he was Lord and Proprietor of <hi>all</hi> this lower World; but when he had propagated a <hi>Family</hi> from his Loyns, and that <hi>Family</hi> was by degrees branched into several <hi>Tribes;</hi> he sent forth these <hi>Tribes</hi> under the Conduct of their Heads, Fathers, and Princes to go and take <hi>Possession</hi> of such, and such Portions of his Earth, as their Numbers, Necessities and Conveniencies required; which when they had done, the Prince and Father of each Tribe <hi>divided</hi> his Land among the Members of it, and <hi>shared</hi> it into particular <hi>Properties,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably to the Merit, or Number of the particular Families contained in it; and when any of these Tribes became too <hi>numerous</hi> and <hi>burthensome</hi> to the Land that was thus divided among them, they sent forth Colonies from among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to take <hi>Possession</hi> of the next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:34683:56"/>
Country bordering upon them; which when they had done, the <hi>Leader</hi> of the Colony divided it among his <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers:</hi> and so as they increased and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed, they spread themselves from Country to Country, till they had shared the World into <hi>Nations,</hi> and divided the <hi>Nations</hi> into distinct and particular <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,</hi> and Families. And this Division was the <hi>Original Law,</hi> by which each Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily claimed as its <hi>Property</hi> the share that was allotted to it: and since the <hi>Father</hi> of Mankind was intitled by <hi>God,</hi> who is the <hi>supreme Proprietor</hi> to all this Terrestrial Globe, he had an undoubted Right to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide</hi> it among the several Tribes that descended from him; and therefore since he impowred the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> of his Tribes, to take <hi>Possession</hi> of such and such Portions, and <hi>divide</hi> it among their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; not only each <hi>particular Tribe</hi> had an undoubted <hi>Right</hi> to the Portion allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it by him that was Head of them all, but each particular <hi>Family</hi> had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right to the <hi>share</hi> that was allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, by him that was the <hi>Head</hi> of the Tribe it belonged to. And thus you see the first <hi>Division</hi> of the World among Men was the great <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Property;</hi> and that whatsoever Men were possessed of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:34683:56"/>
by it, they had an undoubted <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to: and upon this Law all the <hi>Meums</hi> and <hi>Tuums,</hi> the particular <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> that are now in the World are <hi>founded.</hi> For though in process of time not only the <hi>Tribes</hi> and <hi>Colonies</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached upon one another, 'till the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by swallowing up the weaker grew into <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Empires;</hi> but even the particular Families also of these <hi>Tribes</hi> and <hi>Colonies</hi> incroach'd upon each other, and either by Fraud or Oppression robbed their Neighbours of their <hi>Original share;</hi> so that those Rights and Properties which were made by the <hi>Primitive Divisions,</hi> seem for the most part if not altogether extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished; yet it is to be considered, that the Laws now extant do suppose all <hi>Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations</hi> of <hi>Property</hi> from the first Owners to have been made according to that <hi>Original Law</hi> of division; which Law did not so <hi>unalienably</hi> entail on those Tribes and Families their appropriate <hi>Shares,</hi> but that they might either <hi>sell</hi> or <hi>give</hi> them away, or <hi>forfeit</hi> them: and if either of these ways those Shares have passed through all successive Generations till now from Tribe to Tribe, or Family to Family, the <hi>present Possessors</hi> are justly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to them by that <hi>Original Law</hi> of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:34683:57"/>
Division. And that they have thus pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <hi>all Laws</hi> now extant do suppose: the Law of <hi>Nations</hi> supposeth those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries that are held by Right of <hi>Conquest,</hi> to have been justly <hi>forfeited</hi> to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror; and that unless they are so, his Conquest is <hi>Robbery,</hi> and not <hi>Right:</hi> the Municipal Laws of <hi>Countries</hi> do suppose the Estates of particular Families to be held by the Right of <hi>Donation,</hi> or <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase</hi> from the true <hi>Proprietor,</hi> and that unless they are so, their first Possession was a <hi>Theft</hi> and not a <hi>Right:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither the Law of <hi>Nations,</hi> nor the Law of <hi>Countries</hi> do allow either Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, or Families to be <hi>rightful Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors</hi> of their Conquests, and Estates, so long as there appeareth any <hi>just Claim</hi> against them. But though the first Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion should be obtained either by <hi>unjust</hi> Conquest, or by <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Oppression;</hi> yet if it continue in the Lineage or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the unjust Possessor, till all <hi>just</hi> Claim against it be <hi>extinguish'd,</hi> the Law must suppose it to be obtained <hi>justly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there <hi>appeareth</hi> no Evidence to the contrary. And indeed when a <hi>Dominion,</hi> or an <hi>Estate,</hi> which was at first unjustly obtained, hath been so long <hi>successively</hi> possessed, as that no Man can produce a
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:34683:57"/>
                  <hi>just</hi> Claim and Title to it, it must be either the present Possessor's, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies: but then when <hi>God,</hi> who is the <hi>supreme Proprietor</hi> of all, doth by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential Permission continue any <hi>ill-got</hi> Possession, till all lawful Claim to it is worn out, he doth thereby intitle the <hi>present Possessor</hi> to it, and createth it his <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi> For though God's <hi>Providence</hi> can be no Rule against his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will,</hi> nor consequently can autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize any Man to possess what another hath a just Claim to, because his Revealed Will forbiddeth it: yet it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that when no Man can justly Claim what I Possess, I wrong no Man in possessing it, and consequently am in no wise forbidden it by God's Revealed Will; and therefore in this Case by his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential Continuance</hi> of the Inheritance of it to me, he giveth me free Leave to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess it; and that <hi>Leave</hi> is an implicit Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of a just <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Title</hi> to it. So that <hi>Legal Possession,</hi> when there is no <hi>Iust</hi> or <hi>Legal Claim</hi> against it, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right, a Right founded on the free Donation of <hi>God,</hi> who is the <hi>Supreme Proprietor</hi> of all things: and therefore <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> obligeth us not to rob, or deprive Men of what they are intitled to by <hi>Law;</hi>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:34683:58"/>
nor to despoil any Man by Stealth, or strip him by Violence, or defraud him by Craft and cunning Insinuation of any <hi>Right,</hi> or <hi>Property</hi> to which the <hi>Law</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titleth him; because by thus doing we do not only wrong Man of that Right which by <hi>Legal Conveyance</hi> he deriveth from <hi>God,</hi> but we do also wrong <hi>God</hi> himself by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming to alienate <hi>his</hi> Bequests, and to reverse and cancel <hi>his</hi> Donations. For he who by Stealth, or Robbery, or Fraud depriveth another of his Property, doth impiously invade <hi>God's Right</hi> of bestowing his own where he pleaseth; and refuseth to stand to that Division, and Allotment which <hi>his Providence</hi> hath made in his own World: he doth in effect declare in his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that God hath nothing to do to share his World among his Creatures, that he will not endure him to reign Lord and Master in his own Family of Beings, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>his Providence</hi> to Carve and distribute his own Bread and Meat among his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; but that he will snatch from every one's Trencher, and Carve what he pleases for himself out of every Man's Commons, and Allowance. So that to deprive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you see, of what he is Legally possessed of is a high, and crying Injustice against <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men:</hi> for he that will needs have more of God's Goods than God hath
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:34683:58"/>
given him, is an <hi>impious Robber</hi> of God; and he that will needs have those Goods of God which he hath given to another, must be an <hi>unjust Robber</hi> of Man. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have injuriously deprived another of his Legal Rights, we are bound by all the ties of <hi>Religion</hi> towards God, and of <hi>Honesty</hi> towards Men, to make what <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> we are able: for it is certain that my wrongful <hi>Seisure</hi> of what is another Man's doth not alienate his <hi>Right</hi> to it, so that he hath the same <hi>Right</hi> to it while I keep it from him, as he had at first when I took it from him, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till I <hi>restore</hi> it back to him, I persist to wrong him of it; and my detaining it is a continued <hi>Repetition</hi> of that Fraud, or Theft, or Oppression, by which I wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully seized it. And whilst I thus persist in the <hi>Sin,</hi> the <hi>Guilt</hi> of it abideth upon me; and I am justly responsible to the Tribunal of Heaven, for being a Robber of God and Men. Whilst therefore I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly <hi>detain</hi> what is another's Right, I keep the Earnest-peny which the Devil gave me to intitle him to my Soul for ever; and so long as I possess the Spoils of my injured Brother, I maintain so many <hi>Evidences</hi> to give Testimony against me, and to raise a Cry on me as high as the Tribunal of God.</p>

For Praise and Honour are the natural <hi>Dues,</hi> the Birthright and Patrimony of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; which by its own inherent <hi>Merit</hi> challengeth Esteem and Veneration: he who excelleth another, hath a <hi>Right</hi> to be preferred before him in the Esteem and Value of the World; to have his Light reflected with a more glorious Splendor, and his Excellencies resounded with higher Elogiums. Now the Excellency of a Man consisteth in the Graces and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his <hi>Mind;</hi> and as we do not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:34683:59"/>
a Ship excellent, because it is curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously carved and inlaid, but because it is exactly fitted to all the purposes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation; as we do not account a Sword to be excellent, because it hath a rich Hilt, or Embroidered Scabbord, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath a keen Edge, a sharp Point, or a good Guard and Temper: so none but Fools will esteem a Man to be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, because he hath a great Estate, or a comely Body, or weareth fine Clothes, and rich Trappings; but because he hath a brave and a goodly <hi>Mind,</hi> a <hi>Soul</hi> well adorned with <hi>Intellectual,</hi> or <hi>Moral</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments. These are the Glories of the <hi>Man,</hi> whereas all the rest are only the Imbellishments of his <hi>Case</hi> and <hi>Outside.</hi> So that the true stamp of Nobility is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Minds</hi> of Men; and consisteth in those <hi>Graces</hi> of Understanding and Will, whereby we represent and resemble <hi>God,</hi> who is the Pattern of <hi>Excellency,</hi> and the Fountain of <hi>Honour.</hi> So that true <hi>Honour</hi> is nothing else but a due Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Excellencies of Mens Minds and Wills, or their own <hi>Intellectual</hi> or <hi>Moral</hi> Accomplishments ecchoed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberated upon them in just Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments and Commendations; which to with-hold from one that truely <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:34683:60"/>
them is great <hi>Injustice</hi> and <hi>Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty.</hi> For he who detaineth from a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Person those honourable Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments that are <hi>due</hi> to his Virtues, robbeth <hi>Virtue</hi> it self of one of the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Jewels in her Diadem, and that is her <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Glory:</hi> he strippeth and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poileth her of her Garments of Praise, stealeth from her her Native Rays and Luster, and buries her alive in Darkness and Obscurity; and therefore since to rob a <hi>virtuous Person</hi> of his Honour and Reputation is so great an outrage to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> it self, it must needs be highly <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>dishonest.</hi> And herein consisteth the great Iniquity of <hi>Detraction,</hi> and of les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening, or debasing Mens deserved Praises and Commendations; which is a higher <hi>Injustice</hi> than to pick their Purses; for he that clips or imbaseth a Man's <hi>Honour,</hi> robbeth him of his best and dearest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; and whilst he sucketh the Veins of anothers Reputation to put colour into the Cheeks of his own, he liveth upon the <hi>Spoils</hi> of his Neighbour; and is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry whit as injurious to him, as if he should pull down his House about his Ears to build himself another in its Ruins. And yet how common is this <hi>unrighteous</hi> Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice among Men? How doth this grove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

                  <hi>Serpent</hi> lurk almost in every Hedge, to snap at the Heel of every nobler Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that passeth by?

These, and a thousand other tricks of <hi>Detraction</hi> are frequently practised in all Conversations; but certainly did Men but consider what a <hi>villanous Injustice</hi> this is, and how much it provoketh God, who will one day make a strict Inquisition for Mens good <hi>Names,</hi> as well as for their <hi>Blood,</hi> they would never dare to allow themselves in such a crying Injustice towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:34683:61"/>IV. THERE are other <hi>Rights</hi> acquired by outward <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>Quality,</hi> whether it be in respect of titular <hi>Dignity,</hi> or of <hi>Wealth,</hi> and large <hi>Possessions;</hi> by both which Men do acquire a Right to Civil <hi>Respect</hi> and outward <hi>Obeisance.</hi> For as for the several degrees of <hi>Nobility, Titles</hi> and places of <hi>Dignity,</hi> by which Men are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd above the vulgar Class into the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per form of Mankind, they are so many Marks and Badges of Honour; by which the <hi>King,</hi> who is the Fountain of Honour, and who by smiling on a Clod of Earth can, with the <hi>April</hi> Sun, prefer it into a gay Flower, doth raise and enoble Men, advance them into a higher Orb, a more illustrious Rank and Station in the World. Now though by virtue of this titular <hi>Dignity,</hi> we are no farther obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence or esteem Men, than their <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> or <hi>Virtue</hi> deserveth; yet are we bound to give them their <hi>due Titles,</hi> and demean our selves towards them with that outward <hi>Preference, Observance,</hi> and <hi>Ceremony,</hi> which their Degree and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity requireth; otherwise we rob them of those Rights, which the <hi>King,</hi> who is Master of outward <hi>Respects</hi> and <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedencies,</hi> hath bestowed upon them. For the <hi>Royal Stamp</hi> upon any kind of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:34683:61"/>
Metal giveth it an <hi>extrinsick</hi> Value, and determineth the Rate at which it is to pass among Coins; though it cannot raise its <hi>intrinsick</hi> Worth, nor make that which is but <hi>Brass</hi> to be <hi>Gold.</hi> And as titular <hi>Dignities</hi> intitle Men to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Respect</hi> and <hi>Observance,</hi> so also doth <hi>Wealth</hi> and large <hi>Possessions:</hi> for these are Badges of Honour as well as the other, only the other we receive from the <hi>King,</hi> but these from the <hi>King of Kings.</hi> For when God bestoweth upon one Man a larger Fortune and Possessions than on an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, he doth thereby prefer and advance him into an higher <hi>Sphere</hi> and <hi>Condition;</hi> and when God hath set him above us, it is just and fit that we should rise and give place to him. And though a wise, or <hi>virtuous</hi> Poor Man hath more Right to our Esteem, than a <hi>fortunate</hi> Knave or Fool, who in all his Glory is but a Beast of burthen in rich Trapping and Capari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; yet forasmuch as in outward Rank and Condition God hath preferred the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he hath the <hi>Right</hi> of Precedency, and of outward Respects and Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and ought to be treated with greater Obeysance and Regard,</p>

               </head>
               <p>V. FIfthly and Lastly, THERE are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Rights</hi> acquir'd by <hi>Bargain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Compact:</hi> for Compacts being a mutual transferring of Rights, wherein the Person with whom I bargain maketh over such a Commodity to me for so much mony or other valuable thing, the Right whereof I make over to him; we mutually owe this Right to one another, to deal truly and honestly in <hi>making,</hi> and sincerely and faithfully in <hi>discharging</hi> our Compacts, and mutual Engagements with each other. For since the end of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and Buying and Selling is <hi>mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> to assist and furnish one another with the Necessaries and Conveniencies of Life; both Buyer and Seller must thence have a Right accruing to them so to buy and sell, as that they may be <hi>mutually</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by one another; as that the Buyer may have the worth of his Price, and the Seller the worth of his Commodity: for otherwise instead of mutually assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34683:62"/>
the one must necessarily depress and damnifie the other. What the exact <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> is, which in matter of buying and selling ought to be observed between Man and Man, is, I confess, a difficult que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and hardly capable of being <hi>nicely determined;</hi> especially by us who are so little acquainted with the Affairs of the World, the necessities of things, and the particular and hidden Reasons of some sorts of Traffick and dealing: and therefore that I may not venture beyond my depth in the Determination of this matter, I shall only prescribe such general <hi>Rules</hi> of Righteousness to Conduct our <hi>Bargains</hi> and <hi>Contracts,</hi> as being impartially ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to particular Cases, may secure Men from dealing wrongfully and injuriously with one another. And they are these, first, <hi>Use, Plainness</hi> and <hi>Simplicity</hi> in all your Dealings. Secondly, Impose upon no Man's <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or <hi>Unskilfulness.</hi> Thirdly, Take no advantage of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's <hi>Necessities.</hi> Fourthly, Subtract not from the <hi>Commodity</hi> or <hi>Price,</hi> for which you have Contracted. Fifthly, Go not to the <hi>utmost</hi> Verge of what thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivest to be <hi>lawful.</hi> Sixthly, In doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cases choose the <hi>safest</hi> Part.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:34683:63"/>I. USE <hi>Plainness</hi> and <hi>Simplicity</hi> in all your Dealings: Do not by disparaging <hi>another</hi> Man's Commodity, or over-valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>your own,</hi> endeavour to draw on an advantageous Bargain; neither ask far <hi>beyond,</hi> nor bid much <hi>below</hi> the worth of Commodities. Say not, you cannot take less, or give more, when you <hi>know</hi> you may with fair Advantage and Profit. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not what is <hi>false,</hi> cover not what is <hi>true;</hi> but so far as in you lyeth, fit your Affirmations and Denials to the <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> of the Person you deal with; and do not lie in Ambush behind your words to trap and ensnare him. For in Bargains not only that which is <hi>false</hi> is unjust, but also that which <hi>deceives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. IMPOSE upon no Man's <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Unskilfulness.</hi> Whilst you keep within the latitude of lawful Gain, you may use your Skill against another Man in driving a Bargain; for in an ordinary <hi>Plenty</hi> of Commodities there is an ordinary <hi>Price,</hi> which those that deal in them know and understand; and when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractors equally <hi>understand</hi> the Price, there can be no Deception or Injustice on either side. But if he whom I Contract with be <hi>ignorant</hi> or <hi>unskilful,</hi> I must not rate his want of understanding, or set a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34683:63"/>
Tax upon his Ignorance, but use him not only <hi>justly,</hi> but <hi>ingenuously,</hi> as one that reposeth a trust in me and casteth himself upon my <hi>Equity;</hi> considering that to take advantage from his <hi>Simplicity</hi> to abuse and defraud him, would be not only <hi>Injustice</hi> but <hi>Inhumanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. TAKE no advantage of another's <hi>Necessities.</hi> Do not wring and squeeze a poor Man when he is driven to your Doors by his <hi>Wants,</hi> and forced to Sell his Wares to supply his <hi>Necessities;</hi> but give him the same Price you would have done, supposing he wanted your <hi>Mony</hi> no more than you need his <hi>Commodity.</hi> And if the poor Man be forced to Buy of you upon <hi>Trust,</hi> increase your Price no higher, than what is necessary to make you recompence for the <hi>Loss,</hi> which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Trade you must sustain by your <hi>Forbearance;</hi> reckoning in also the hazards you run, which ought to be charitably as well as prudently esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated. For he who makes advantage of another's Necessities, robs the Spittle, and adds Oppression to Misery; which is not only <hi>Injustice</hi> but <hi>Barbarity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. SUBTRACT not from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, or Price, for which you have Contracted. For he who <hi>buys</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:34683:64"/>
by Weight and Measure, hath a Right to as much of it as the Common Standard allows him; to have a full Standard, Pound, or Pint or Bushel ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he Bargains or Contracts. And to subtract any think from what he hath bargained for, whether it be by <hi>false</hi> Weights or Measures, ot by <hi>falsly</hi> weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or measuring, is no better than <hi>Theft</hi> and <hi>Robbery.</hi> And so on the other hand, he who <hi>sells</hi> a Commodity hath a Right to the Mony for which he sold it; and therefore for the Buyer either <hi>knowingly</hi> to pay him uncurrent Coin, or <hi>forcibly</hi> to detain from him any part of the Price agreed on, is a manifest <hi>Violation</hi> of the Eternal Rules of Righteousness.</p>
               <p>V. GO not to the <hi>utmost</hi> Verge of what you conceive to be <hi>lawful;</hi> for he who goes to the <hi>utmost</hi> of what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ventures to the brink of a <hi>Precipice,</hi> where he stands in imminent danger of falling headlong into it. For it is a short and easie Passage from the <hi>utmost</hi> limits of what is <hi>lawful,</hi> to the nearmost of what is <hi>sinful;</hi> so that he, that will go as far as he <hi>may,</hi> will never be able to avoid going sometimes farther than he <hi>should;</hi> especially when he is led on by <hi>Interest,</hi> and hath a tempting prospect of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:34683:64"/>
before him; which is wont to blind the Eyes of Men, to warp their Judgment, to tincture their Minds with <hi>false colours</hi> and <hi>undue apprehensions</hi> of <hi>things.</hi> Wherefore in that Latitude of <hi>lawful Gain</hi> which is allowed you, use Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour towards the <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>necessitous,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity towards the <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and Moderation towards <hi>all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VI. Sixthly and Lastly, IN doubtful Cases choose the <hi>safest</hi> Part: for not only a <hi>good,</hi> but a <hi>quiet</hi> Conscience is to be valued above the greatest Gain; and that Man hath but little regard of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that will venture to expose it to a wound to get a Shilling more in a bargain. Wherefore if we would be <hi>safe,</hi> we must make this a constant Rule of Action, in matters of <hi>Duty</hi> to do the <hi>most,</hi> in matters of <hi>Priviledge</hi> and divisions of Right, or proportions of Gain, in all doubtful Cases, to choose the <hi>least,</hi> which to be sure is always the <hi>safest.</hi> For if in buying and selling I make any Advantage which I doubt is unlawful, I stake my Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at a Lottery, and throw Cross and Pile whether I shall be guilty, or inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent: and thus to <hi>play</hi> and <hi>dally</hi> with my Innocence is but one degree of Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption from being <hi>wilfully Guilty.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>I PROCEED in the next place to shew what those <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Immutable</hi> Reasons are, which render Justice <hi>morally</hi> good. I have elsewhere shewed at large, that that which makes a thing to be <hi>morally</hi> Good is this, that it's Obligation is founded in some <hi>Eternal</hi> and <hi>Immutable</hi> Reasons; so that we are obliged to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it by such Reasons as can never cease or change, or alter with <hi>Times</hi> or <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances:</hi> and that this is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Positive</hi> and <hi>Moral</hi> Duties, that the one are founded upon <hi>temporary</hi> and <hi>changeable</hi> Reasons, and so may and will one time or other cease to oblige us; as the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the Jews have done, and the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of Christians will do; whereas the other being backed with <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi> Reasons can never cease to oblige us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore to demonstrate <hi>Iustice</hi> to be a <hi>Moral</hi> Duty, or one of those Moral Goods which God hath made known to us, it will be necessary to produce some <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>unchangeable</hi> Reasons whereby
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34683:66"/>
it binds and obliges us: and of such I shall produce these Four;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, The eternal <hi>Proportion</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity</hi> of Justice to the Nature of <hi>Things.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, The eternal <hi>Conformity</hi> of it to the Nature of <hi>God:</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Thirdly, The eternal <hi>Correspondency</hi> of it with the <hi>Divine</hi> Providence and Disposals:</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, The eternal <hi>Necessity</hi> of it to the Happiness of <hi>Men.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>I. ONE <hi>eternal</hi> Reason by which we stand obliged to do justly, is the eternal <hi>Proportion</hi> and <hi>Congruity</hi> of Justice to the nature of things. For there are in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture eternal <hi>Respects</hi> of Things to Things, which are as fix'd and unalterable as the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Things themselves: as for instance, some things are naturally <hi>more perfect</hi> than others, such as the superiour Kinds and Orders of Beings; others are naturally <hi>equal</hi> in perfection, such as are Individuals of the same kind of Beings; others are naturally <hi>less perfect,</hi> such as the inferior Ranks and Species of Beings; and since <hi>Nature</hi> hath thus ranked and placed things either <hi>above,</hi> or <hi>below,</hi> or <hi>equal</hi> to one another; every Being in the world must naturally respect every one, either as it is <hi>superior</hi> or <hi>inferior,</hi> or <hi>equal:</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:34683:66"/>
and these <hi>Respects</hi> are as inseparable to their Natures, as those <hi>Degrees</hi> of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction are which constitute their Kinds and Orders. So that were all the Beings in the world <hi>Rational,</hi> and understood but their mutual <hi>Respects</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> to one another, they would thereby be <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged</hi> to demean themselves towards each other suitably to that Rank and Form of Being wherein Nature hath placed them; and by their Actions to acknowledge themselves <hi>superior</hi> or <hi>inferior</hi> or <hi>equal</hi> to one another, according as they excel, or equal, or come short of one another in <hi>degrees</hi> of Natural Perfection. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in consisteth the strict and proper Notion of doing <hi>justly, viz.</hi> in treating my Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, Inferiors, and Equals as such, in respecting my Equals equally, and my Superiors and Inferiors according to the degree of Superiority and Inferiority wherein they are placed. So that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> consisteth in acting congruously to those <hi>eternal Respects,</hi> which things bear to one another; or in a practical acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment that the Beings above me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me, and equal to me, do bear such a Respect to me as they really do; that they are just so much my Superiors, so much my Inferiors, or so much my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34683:67"/>
as God and Nature hath made them. For among Beings that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of understanding those Respects and Relations they bear to one another, it is a <hi>natural Due</hi> that they should own one another to be what they are, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually signifie by their Actions and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour what Respects and Relations they bear to one another; that by <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Submission</hi> they should own those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them to be their Superiors; that by <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Condescension</hi> they should own those beneath them to be their Inferiors; and that by <hi>Equity</hi> or <hi>Equality</hi> of Usage and Behaviour, they should own those who are level with them to be their Peers and Equals. These are the Natural Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of our Acknowledgments of those <hi>mutual</hi> Respects and Relations we bear to one another, which not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge is in effect to deny one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be what we are, to thrust one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother out of our <hi>Palaces,</hi> and invade each others <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Peculiars.</hi> So that in short <hi>Iustice</hi> is nothing else but the great <hi>Balance</hi> of the Rational World, which weigheth out to every part of it what is <hi>due</hi> from every one in those respective <hi>Ranks</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> wherein God and Nature hath placed them: and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34683:67"/>
so long as there remaineth any <hi>Proportion</hi> of Nearness or Distance, of Superiority, or Inferiority, or Equality, among Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Beings, that will be a firm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable Reason why they should deal <hi>justly</hi> and <hi>righteously</hi> towards one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; because <hi>dealing justly</hi> is nothing else but a practical Owning and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of these Respects and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; which so long as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, every Being must be obliged to acknowledge, that hath any capacity to know and understand them. For since God hath given me Reason to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that all those Beings which are of my own Kind and Order, are my <hi>Equals</hi> by Nature, I cannot but conclude that they ought to be <hi>equally dealt</hi> with; since equal Things must necessarily belong to equal Beings in the same Circumstances. And from this Principle whereon that Golden Rule is founded, <hi>to do as we would be done by,</hi> all the particular instances of Justice between Man and Man are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally derived. So that the Obligations of Justice, you see, do immediately grow out of the <hi>Nature</hi> of Things, and those <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> they bear to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and therefore till the <hi>Nature</hi> of Things be utterly unravelled, and their <hi>Respects</hi> to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:34683:68"/>
one another for ever cancelled and reversed, every Rational Being must be obliged to be <hi>just;</hi> that is, to acknowledge, so far as he understands it, the <hi>Respect</hi> and <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> he beareth to all <hi>other</hi> Beings; by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning himself submissively towards his Superiors, equally towards his Equals, and condescendingly towards his Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. And whatsoever we are obliged to by the <hi>Nature</hi> of Things, we are obliged to by the <hi>Author</hi> of Nature; whose <hi>Works</hi> are as real Signs and Expressions of his Will, as his revealed <hi>Declarations:</hi> and therefore since <hi>he</hi> framed and constituted us with such Respects and Relations to one another, that is as plain a significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that it is <hi>his Will</hi> we should demean our selves accordingly, as if he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed it by a Voice of Thunder from the Battlements of Heaven. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath thus ingraven the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Justice upon the <hi>Nature</hi> of Things, they must abide for ever, and be as eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal as those <hi>Respects</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> are which things bear to one another.</p>
               <p>II. ANOTHER eternal Reason by which we are obliged to do <hi>justly,</hi> is the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of it to the Nature of <hi>God.</hi> For <hi>Iustice</hi> is one of the brightest Jewels of God's Diadem, one of those most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:34683:68"/>
                  <hi>Attributes</hi> which do eternally crown and adorn his Nature and determine his Will and direct his Actions. <hi>Iust and true are thy ways, thou King of Saints;</hi> Rev. v. 3. <hi>Righteous art thou O Lord, and upright are thy Iudgments.</hi> Psal. cxix. 137. <hi>Are not my ways equal, and are not your ways unequal?</hi> saith God himself, appealing to the Consciences of his Subjects, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> xviii. 29. Consonantly to all which is the assertion of <hi>Plato,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. God cannot be said to be unjust in any respect whatsoever, but is in all Kinds just to the utmost Possibility. And indeed the eternal <hi>Self-sufficiency</hi> of his own Nature sets him above all manner of temptation to deal injuriously by his <hi>Creatures:</hi> he wants none of <hi>their</hi> Rights to enrich himself, needeth none of <hi>their</hi> Happiness to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>his own;</hi> which is so boundless and secure, that it can neither admit of any Increase, or be liable to any Diminution. What then should move him either to <hi>deprive</hi> his Creatures of any Good that is their due, or to <hi>inflict</hi> on them any Evil that they have not deserved; when he can serve no End of his own, nor reap any Advantage to himself by it? For all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice springs out of <hi>Want,</hi> and <hi>Indigence;</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:34683:69"/>
which being utterly excluded from the Nature of <hi>God,</hi> it is impossible there should be any unjust Inclination, or Tendency in him. And as by the infinite <hi>Self-sufficiency</hi> of his Nature he is secured from all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation to Injustice, so by the infinite <hi>Goodness</hi> of it he stands unvariably bent and inclined to deal justly and righteously by his Creatures. For <hi>Goodness</hi> is nothing but an Inclination of Nature to bestow more Good than is <hi>due,</hi> and inflict less Evil than is <hi>deserved;</hi> which Inclination being inseparable to the nature of God, it is impossible for him either to <hi>with-hold</hi> from us any Right, or to punish us <hi>wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> without doing Violence to <hi>himself</hi> and committing an Outrage on his own Nature. So that the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is a Law of Righteousness to himself, by which his Will and Actions are constantly determined to what is <hi>just</hi> and <hi>equal;</hi> to require nothing of us but what is <hi>possible,</hi> to proportion our Burthens to our Strength, or our Strength to our Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, to satisfie all his Engagements to us, and not with-hold from us any of those Goods which we can claim by the Title of his gracious <hi>Promises;</hi> in a word, to proportion the Evils of our <hi>Sufferings</hi> to the Evils of our <hi>Sin,</hi> and not to plague
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:34683:69"/>
us for nothing, or for what we cannot help, or beyond the <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Demerit</hi> of our Fault: and whatsoever else is just from a <hi>God</hi> to a <hi>Creature,</hi> he is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably determined to choose and act by the Law of Righteousness in his own <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> Since therefore the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is the great Exemplar and Pattern of all <hi>Reasonable Natures,</hi> as being it self the most <hi>perfectly reasonable;</hi> whatsoever is imitable in it we are eternally obliged to copy and transcribe into our own; and consequently since he is <hi>eternally just,</hi> that is an eternal Reason why we should be so. By dealing <hi>justly</hi> with one another we act like God, whose Nature is the Standard of ours; and 'tis certainly fit that all <hi>Reasonable Beings</hi> should deal by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as <hi>God</hi> who is the most reasonable, dealeth by them; that they should choose and act in conformity to <hi>him</hi> who is the <hi>Pattern</hi> of Goodness, and the <hi>Rule</hi> of Perfection. And herein consisteth our Conformity to him, that we live by the Law of his Nature; and therefore so long as that Law determineth him to deal justly by <hi>us,</hi> it ought to determine us to deal justly by <hi>one another.</hi> So that the Obligations of <hi>Iustice</hi> are as eternal as the Nature of <hi>God;</hi> for so long as <hi>he</hi> is
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34683:70"/>
righteous, <hi>we</hi> are bound to be righteous in conformity to <hi>him;</hi> and therefore since <hi>he</hi> cannot cease to be righteous without ceasing to be happy and good, or which is all one, to be <hi>God, We</hi> can never cease being obliged to be righteous so long as <hi>God</hi> is.</p>
               <p>III. ANOTHER eternal Reason by which we are obliged to do <hi>justly,</hi> is the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Correspondency of it with the <hi>Divine Providence</hi> and <hi>Disposals.</hi> For God being the supreme Lord and Proprietor of Beings, all those Rights and Properties which we claim of one another must be <hi>originally</hi> derived from him; even as the claims of the <hi>under-Tenants</hi> are from the <hi>Head-Landlord.</hi> All those <hi>Natural</hi> Rights we are invested with, we derive from him who is the Author of our Nature; who by creating us what we are, and uniting us by Natural Ligaments to one another, hath endowed us with all those Rights, which we claim as Rational Creatures dwelling in Mortal Bodies, and joyned together by <hi>Natural Relations</hi> and <hi>Society.</hi> So that to deal <hi>justly</hi> by one another, or with respect to our Natural Rights, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to allow one another what God hath entailed upon our Natures, and <hi>mutually</hi> to render those Dues to each other, which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34683:70"/>
he hath intitled us to by the very <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> of our Beings: and for us to with-hold from one another those Rights, which God hath consigned to us by the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Formation</hi> of our <hi>Natures,</hi> is to quarrel with his Workmanship, and declare our selves disatisfied with the State of his Creation. For whatsoever I have a Right to as I am a <hi>Man,</hi> I have a Right to by the state and condition of my <hi>Nature;</hi> and therefore he who alloweth me not <hi>that,</hi> alloweth me not to be what <hi>God</hi> hath made me; permitteth me not to enjoy that State and Condition of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherein God hath created and placed me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For whatsoever I have Right to as I am a <hi>Man,</hi> I have a Right to from <hi>God</hi> who made me a Man; and therefore he who denyeth me the Right of my <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> thrusteth me down from the Form wherein God hath placed me, and useth me as if I <hi>were not</hi> what God hath made me; whereby he doth in effect fly in the Face of my Creatour, and quarrel with God for making me what I am. In a word, it is <hi>eternally reasonable</hi> that I who am the Creature of God, should pay so much Reverence to his all-creating Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power, as to treat every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture suitably to the <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi> of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34683:71"/>
its Creation; and consequently to treat <hi>Men</hi> as <hi>Men,</hi> that is, as Beings endowed by God with the common Rights of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; which if I do not, I alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate from my own Kind what <hi>God</hi> hath endowed it with, and so in effect do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow of <hi>his</hi> Endowments, and impiously call in question the Rights of <hi>his</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For either I must own that God ought not to have constituted Humane Nature with such <hi>Rights,</hi> which would be to impeach his Creation; or that I ought to render it those <hi>Rights</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult from its Frame and Constitution: and therefore when by my Actions I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own that I <hi>ought</hi> to render them, I do in effect quarrel with God's Creation for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing such Rights upon Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and declare that I am resolved not to be concluded by it; but that I will for ever defie the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Creation, and will not abide by that <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> which it hath established in the Nature of Things. If therefore it be reasonable, eternally reasonable for Creatures to act agreeably to the <hi>Order</hi> of their Creation; this is an eternal Reason why we should render to one another those Rights which God hath bequeathed to us by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of our <hi>Natures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:34683:71"/>AND as our natural Rights are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to us from God by his <hi>Creation,</hi> so are our acquired also derived from him by his <hi>Providence;</hi> who having reserved to himself the Sovereign Disposal of all our Affairs, is our <hi>Founder</hi> and <hi>Benefactor,</hi> upon whom we all depend for every <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> we acquire by our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and Intercourse with one another: and that this is <hi>mine,</hi> and that <hi>yours,</hi> is owing to the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, which carves out to every one his Portion of Right, and divides as <hi>he</hi> sees fit his World among his Creatures. So that Justice as it refers to <hi>acquired Rights,</hi> consists in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing every Man to enjoy what God hath given him by his all-disposing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: and if God hath an eternal Right to <hi>share</hi> his own Goods among his own Creatures as he pleases, then that is an eternal Reason why we should allow one another to enjoy those <hi>Portions</hi> which he hath shared and divided to us. For by depriving another Man of what God's Providence hath given him, I do not only rob <hi>him</hi> of his Right to enjoy it, but I also rob <hi>God</hi> of his Right to dispose it. Fore while I with-hold or take away what God hath given to another, I take <hi>his</hi> Goods against his leave, and impiously
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34683:72"/>
invade <hi>his Province</hi> of bestowing his own where he pleaseth: and whilst I thus carve for my <hi>self</hi> out of those Allowances which he hath carved to <hi>others,</hi> I live in open <hi>Rebellion</hi> against his Providence, and am an Out-law to his Government. For this in effect is the Sense and Meaning of my <hi>wrongful Incroachments</hi> upon other Mens Rights, that I will not be concluded by that Division and Allotment of Things which <hi>God</hi> hath made; but that I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and carve for <hi>my self,</hi> and live at my own Allowance; that I will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to share his <hi>own World,</hi> nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure him to reign Lord and Master in his <hi>own Family</hi> of Beings, but e'en live as I list, and take what I can catch without asking God's leave, who is the supreme Proprietor and Disposer. So that to deal unjustly by <hi>Men,</hi> whether it be in respect of their <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>acquired</hi> Rights, is a direct opposition to the <hi>divine</hi> Ordination and Disposal: and therefore if it be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reasonable for us who are God's <hi>Creatures</hi> and <hi>Subjects,</hi> to comply with the Order of his <hi>Creation</hi> and the disposals of his <hi>Providence,</hi> that is an eternal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why we should deal <hi>justly</hi> with one another</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:34683:72"/>IV. Fourthly and Lastly, ANOTHER eternal Reason why we are obliged to do <hi>justly,</hi> is the everlasting <hi>Necessity</hi> of it to the Happiness of Men: For <hi>Iustice</hi> is the Pillar and Support of all <hi>Society,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is impossible for <hi>Rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> ever to live happily with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For while I deal unjustly by <hi>others,</hi> I draw all Men into a Combination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst me; who having all the same ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der sense of their own Interest and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness as I have of mine, must be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently jealous of all Designs and Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on their <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Properties;</hi> and consequently be ready to conclude from my Injustice towards <hi>one,</hi> that I am prepared to do mischief to <hi>any</hi> for the advancement of my own End: so that when once I am remarked for a Person that bears no regard to <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong,</hi> it becometh the joint and equal Interest of <hi>all</hi> to declare open War ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>inst <hi>me,</hi> and treat me as an open Enemy without Mercy and Compassion. So that one <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just</hi> Man in a Society is a <hi>common Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance</hi> to all the rest, for by every <hi>single</hi> Injury he doth he alarms the Jealousie of <hi>every</hi> Man, every Man having reason to conclude that he shall be served by him in the <hi>same</hi> kind, if he should happen to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34683:73"/>
fall into the <hi>same Circumstances:</hi> and as he distubs <hi>others,</hi> so he cannot securely enjoy <hi>himself;</hi> for how can that Man be secure that acts as an Enemy to Mankind, and for that reason hath just cause to suspect that every Man is his Enemy who is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to his injurious Behaviour? The <hi>Fear</hi> of which must necessarily deprive him of all <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for the present, and of all <hi>Security</hi> for the future. So that unjust Persons are a <hi>Plague</hi> to themselves, and others; and like frighted <hi>Porcupins</hi> they are disturbed <hi>within,</hi> whilst they dart their Quils at all <hi>without</hi> them. What a dark rude <hi>Chaos</hi> then would this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable World be, should <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Righteousness</hi> forsake it; should Rapine and Violence, Falsehood and Oppression reign, and the strongest Arm be sole Arbitrator of Right and Wrong; should all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> and <hi>Professions</hi> be converted into <hi>Traps</hi> and <hi>Snares;</hi> and every Man lay Ambushes in his words, and lurk behind them in <hi>reserved</hi> meanings, only to wait an opportunity to surprize and ruin every one he converses with? What would the Consequence of this be, but the disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all <hi>Society,</hi> and the converting of this humane World into a Den of <hi>Wolves</hi> and <hi>Cannibals?</hi> For by reason of Mens

continued Experience of each others <hi>Falsehood</hi> and <hi>Insincerity,</hi> all <hi>mutual</hi> Trust and Confidence would be banished from among them; and every one would be forced to stand upon his guard, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Expectation of Mischief from every one; and so all their Intercourse would consist in a Trade of <hi>Diabolical Knaveries,</hi> in doing and retaliating Injuries, and in circumventing and playing the Devils with one another. Which would be such a dreadful State of things, that I verily believe were it left to my own option, I should rather choose to languish out an Eternity in some <hi>dismal Dungeon</hi> alone, and there converse only with my own si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent griefs; than to dwell for ever in the <hi>Garden</hi> of the World, accompanied with such <hi>false</hi> and <hi>villanous</hi> Creatures. But now, do but turn the other end of the Perspective, and imagine that you saw <hi>Iudgment running down like Water, and Righteousness as a mighty Stream,</hi> that you beheld a world of <hi>upright People</hi> ballancing all their Actions and Intercourses in the impartial Scale of <hi>Iustice,</hi> and mutually weighing to one another their <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>acquired Rights</hi> without any Respect or Partiality, the <hi>Superiors</hi> graciously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descending, the <hi>Inferiors</hi> chearfully sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34683:74"/>
and the <hi>Equals</hi> dealing equally with one another; O good God! what a blessed and happy People would this be? With what <hi>Content</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction, Peace</hi> and mutual <hi>Security</hi> would they deal and converse with one another? Here would be no Quarrels or Contentions, no Jealousies or Suspicions, no dark Designs or false Pretences; but every one would converse with every one with the greatest Openness and Freedom, and all would be inviolably safe in each others <hi>Sincerity</hi> and <hi>Iustice:</hi> Here would be no justling or rencountering, no clashing or interfering of Interests; but every one would sit happy and contented under his own Vine, without any unjust <hi>Desire</hi> of tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing on his <hi>Neighbour's</hi> Inclosure, or disquieting <hi>Fear</hi> of being ejected from his <hi>own.</hi> O! were I but an Inhabitant of such a World as <hi>this,</hi> though of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Rank and Form; how should I despise and pity the most prosperous Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of this unrighteous World we live in? And how loth should I be to change my World for any other, but that of <hi>Angels</hi> and of glorified <hi>Spirits? O Iustice, Iustice,</hi> would Men but call thee down from Heaven again, and permit thee to <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> their Actions, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

what a blessed World wouldst thou convert this Stage of Rapine, Cruelty and Blood! How wouldst thou separate this dark Chaos, and distinguish its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions into Order and Beauty! How soon wouldst thou reform it into an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of Heaven, or lively Figure of that Celestial Aether, where all is <hi>Harmony,</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Happiness!</hi> If therefore it be eternally reasonable that Men should study their own Happiness, that is an everlasting Reason why they should deal <hi>justly</hi> by one another; since without so doing it is for ever <hi>impossible</hi> for them to be <hi>happy.</hi> These are the eternal and immutable Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which constitute Justice a <hi>Moral Good,</hi> and do eternally oblige us to deal <hi>justly</hi> by one another.</p>
               <p>AND now what remaineth, but that we betake our selves to the Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Practice of this <hi>great</hi> and <hi>comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi> Virtue, to give to every Man what is <hi>due</hi> to him either by <hi>Constitution,</hi> or by just <hi>Acquisition;</hi> to deal with every Man with whom we have any Intercourse, as with a <hi>Rational</hi> Creature; to treat him <hi>equitably,</hi> and do him all that good which we might reasonably expect from him, if <hi>we</hi> were placed in <hi>his</hi> Circumstances;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34683:75"/>
to allow him the liberty to <hi>judge</hi> for <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> so far as he is capable, and not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to impose our Opinions upon him by <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>forcible</hi> means; to leave him at liberty to follow the Dictates of <hi>right Reason,</hi> and not seek to debauch him by Persuasion or Threatnings, into <hi>immoral</hi> and <hi>vicious</hi> Courses; to treat him humanely and suitably to the <hi>Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of his <hi>Nature,</hi> and not use him like a Dog, or as if he were an Animal of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior <hi>Species?</hi> For all those things are due to him as he is a <hi>Rational</hi> Creature, and cannot be denyed to him without high <hi>Injustice.</hi> Again, to deal with him as he is a <hi>Rational</hi> Creature placed by God in a <hi>mortal Body;</hi> and neither to <hi>ravish</hi> his Body to satisfie our Lust, nor to <hi>maim</hi> or <hi>destroy</hi> it, uless it be in our own Defence; nor to <hi>captivate</hi> and <hi>enslave</hi> it, unless it be upon free Consent, or upon just For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture; nor to suffer it to <hi>perish</hi> for want of bodily sustenance, so long as it is in our power to support and relieve it. These things he hath a claim to, as he is the <hi>Tenant</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and cannot be denyed without foul <hi>Injustice.</hi> Once more; to use him as a <hi>Rational</hi> Creature united to me by <hi>natural Relations;</hi> if he be my <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> to honour and reverence and obey

him; if he be my <hi>Child,</hi> to love and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct him, maintain and provide for him; if my <hi>Brother</hi> or <hi>Sister</hi> or consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineous <hi>Relation,</hi> to cherish and advise, support and assist him according to my ability. These are the <hi>Dues</hi> of <hi>Natural Relation,</hi> and cannot be with-held without great <hi>Unrighteousness.</hi> Lastly, to treat him as one whom God and Nature hath united to me in the bands of <hi>humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety;</hi> to <hi>love</hi> him and live <hi>peaceably</hi> with him, to speak <hi>Truth</hi> to him, and when I am lawfully called, to swear nothing but <hi>Truth</hi> concerning him, and perform my Promises and Oaths to him, so far as it is lawful and possible; not to blast his <hi>Reputation,</hi> but to defend his Person, Good Name and Estate, so far as I am able, and to allow him a competent share of all those Profits which accrue to me from my <hi>Dealing</hi> and <hi>Intercourse</hi> with him. These are the <hi>natural Dues</hi> which Justice requireth me to render him, and which I cannot with-hold from him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being injurious to the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture within him. And as I am obliged in Justice to render to every one his <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Dues, so I am no less obliged by it to render him his <hi>acquired</hi> ones; to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him whatsoever is due to him upon

the account of any Sacred, or Civil <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> to me; not to intrench upon his le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal <hi>Possessions</hi> either by Fraud or Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; to render him those <hi>Honors</hi> and <hi>Respects</hi> which are owing to his Personal Accomplishments; or to his outward Rank and Quality; and not to defraud, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press, or over-reach him in his <hi>Contracts</hi> and <hi>Bargains</hi> with me. These are the particulars as I have shewed you at large, to which this <hi>comprehensive Virtue</hi> extends it self; and Oh that now having seen upon what <hi>everlasting Reasons</hi> it is built, we would be persuaded to betake our selves to the serious <hi>Practice</hi> of it.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AFTER the explication of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Reasons, and Grounds of <hi>Iustice,</hi> it may be proper to add some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and Considerations against <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:34683:76"/>And First, CONSIDER the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy of <hi>Injustice</hi> to the Terms, and Conditions of the <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> I know there are some People that look upon <hi>Honesty</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> as one of the <hi>beggerly Elements</hi> of Religion, a sort of Heathen Vertue belonging to <hi>carnal</hi> and mere <hi>moral</hi> Men, that are utterly unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> of Godliness: and accordingly in the room of this, and such like Moral Vertues, they have foisted in a sort of <hi>spiritual</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as they call it; which consisteth in a certain <hi>Model</hi> of Conversion and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that is made up of nothing but a mere <hi>fanciful</hi> train of <hi>Dejections</hi> and <hi>Triumphs,</hi> that are most commonly either the effects of a distempered <hi>Blood,</hi> or the unaccountable freaks of an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heated <hi>Fancy:</hi> and if they find they have been Converted <hi>secundùm artem, i. e.</hi> that they have undergone those frightful, sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, or joyous Passions, which this stated <hi>Method</hi> of Regeneration includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, all their After-Religion is nothing else but a <hi>leaning</hi> and <hi>rolling</hi> on Jesus Christ. And whilst they should be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning their Wills, their Tongues, and their Actions by the eternal Rules of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> they are employed, as
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34683:77"/>
they think, in a <hi>higher</hi> Dispensation; in forming odd Schemes of spiritual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, and attending to the inward Whispers and Incomes, and With-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Spirit of God; all which are commonly nothing but only the effects of a melancholy <hi>Fancy</hi> tinctur'd with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Fears, and flushed with a natural <hi>Enthusiasm.</hi> But whatever it be, it is doubtless a <hi>dangerous Mistake</hi> for Men to take up with any Religion, which doth not principally insist upon the <hi>eternal Laws</hi> of Morality: and though <hi>Iustice</hi> or <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty</hi> in our dealings with Men will never <hi>singly</hi> recommend us to God, unless it be conjoyned with <hi>Mercy, Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> yea though all these <hi>together</hi> will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver recommend us to God, unless their Imperfections be purged and expiated by the all-sufficient Merit of our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; yet without <hi>Iustice,</hi> and <hi>Honesty,</hi> all our Religion is a damnable <hi>Cheat;</hi> and all the Merit of our Saviour will be as insignificant to <hi>us,</hi> as it is to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> or <hi>damned</hi> Ghosts. For his Merit is no Refuge for Religious Knaves, his Wounds no Sanctuary for Spiritual Cheats, or Lyars, or Oppressors: and for such persons as <hi>these,</hi> to shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in our Saviour's Propitiation, is to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34683:77"/>
                  <hi>prophane</hi> and <hi>desecrate</hi> it; and thereby to cause those vocal Wounds to <hi>accuse</hi> them which were made to <hi>plead</hi> for them; and to provoke that <hi>eloquent</hi> Blood to cry aloud for vengance against them, which in its native Language <hi>speaketh far better things the blood of Abel.</hi> Heb. xii. 24. For <hi>Iustice</hi> is a Duty of that indispensable necessity, that God <hi>will not,</hi> yea, to speak with Reverence, <hi>cannot</hi> dispense with it: and so far was our Saviour from ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing to obtain a <hi>Dispensation</hi> from it, that the great end of his dying to obtain our Pardon for our past unrighteousness, was to encourage and oblige us to live more justly and righteously for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For so the Apostle telleth us, Tit. ii. 14. <hi>That he gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works:</hi> and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that he hath done for us, he hath plainly assured us by his Apostles, that no <hi>unrighteous</hi> person shall <hi>inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> 1 Cor. vi. 9. and that the <hi>unjust</hi> shall be <hi>reserved unto the day of Iudgment to be punished:</hi> 2 Pet. ii. 9. that <hi>the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness of men,</hi> Rom. i. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>that they all shall be damned that take</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:34683:78"/>
                  <hi>pleasure in unrighteousness,</hi> 2 Thess. ii. 12. And if these things be so, then as ever you hope to enter into the Kingdom of God, to escape his unquenchable Wrath, to hold up your Heads at his Tribunal, and not to be condemned to everlasting Horror and Confusion; be persuaded to <hi>fly from all Unrighteousness,</hi> and use all honest Care to deal justly and righteously with all Men.</p>
               <p>II. CONSIDER the great Vanity, or Desperateness of <hi>Injustice:</hi> for if the Wrong and Injustice you do to another Man be such as is <hi>repairable,</hi> you must resolve to <hi>repair</hi> it, or to <hi>perish</hi> for ever. For he who doth <hi>not</hi> repair an Injury when he is able, doth every moment <hi>continue</hi> and <hi>repeat</hi> it; and though the first inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Act were <hi>transient,</hi> and did expire and die in the Commission, yet because it leaveth a <hi>permanent Evil</hi> behind it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the good Name, or Estate of my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I am as much obliged, if I am able, to <hi>remove</hi> the Evil from him, as I was at first <hi>not</hi> to <hi>bring</hi> it upon him; and all the while I <hi>neglect</hi> to remove it, I wilfully <hi>continue</hi> the evil upon him, and in so doing <hi>continue</hi> wilfully <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> to him. As for instance, when I wilfully asperse another Man's <hi>Reputation,</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:34683:78"/>
my <hi>Sin</hi> dies not with my slanderous Breath, but <hi>survives</hi> in the evil effects of it; and till I have endeavoured to <hi>purge</hi> his stained Reputation, and to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store</hi> him his good Name again by a fair and ingenuous <hi>Vindication,</hi> I am a Slanderer <hi>still,</hi> and accountable for all those hard thoughts, and injurious words which I have <hi>occasioned</hi> others to think or speak against him. Again, when I <hi>rob,</hi> or <hi>defraud</hi> another Man of his Estate, or any part of it, the Sin doth not cease with the <hi>transient Act</hi> of Stealth, or Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenage, or Violence, which endeth and expireth in the Commission; but <hi>continues</hi> so long as the <hi>Damage</hi> and <hi>evil Effect</hi> of it remains: Whilst therefore he suffereth in his Estate by my injurious Act, and 'tis in my power to <hi>repair</hi> it, I continue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring him; and till I have made him all the <hi>Restitution</hi> I am able, I am a Cheat, or a Thief, or a Robber. Since therefore Injustice is a damnable Sin, as I shewed you before, it necessarily followeth that whenever a Man deals unjustly by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he must at the same time either resolve to <hi>undo</hi> his own Act, or to run the hazard of being <hi>undone</hi> for ever; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of which is a ridiculous <hi>Vanity,</hi> and the latter a desperate <hi>Madness.</hi> For what a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34683:79"/>
                  <hi>Vanity</hi> is it, for a Man to <hi>do</hi> what he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solveth to <hi>undoe,</hi> to <hi>slander</hi> with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to <hi>vindicate,</hi> and <hi>cheat</hi> with a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to <hi>refund,</hi> that is, to do an evil thing with a purpose to be never the better for it? If you resolve to <hi>restore</hi> what you wrongfully take from another, why do you <hi>take</hi> it? Is it so cheap a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be wicked, that you should co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet to be wicked for <hi>nothing?</hi> That you should contract a <hi>Guilt</hi> which will bind you over to eternal <hi>Punishment,</hi> with an intention to <hi>part</hi> with all that temporary Gain which <hi>tempted</hi> and <hi>invited</hi> you to it? What is this but to weave a <hi>Penelope's</hi> Web, to do and undo, and build Castles of Cards, to blow them down again? and which is more vain and Nonsensical, to <hi>swallow</hi> deadly <hi>Poison</hi> for our Health and Ease, which we know will rack and convulse us, with a purpose to <hi>vomit</hi> it up again without gaining either Health, or Ease by it? For he who wrongs ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a purpose to make him <hi>Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> doth an evil Action with an intent to get nothing but <hi>Guilt</hi> by it. You say, you intend to <hi>restore</hi> to him what you <hi>wrong</hi> him of, and if so, for what <hi>end</hi> do you wrong him? Unless it be to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your self more Criminal and Guilty:
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34683:79"/>
For when you have restored to him what you have wrongfully deprived him of, what can remain to you but only the Guilt of a <hi>wrongful</hi> and <hi>injurious</hi> Action? So that for Men to deal unjustly by others with an <hi>Intent</hi> to make them Restitution, is the greatest Vanity and Nonsense in the World; but then to do it <hi>without</hi> such an Intent, is the most desperate Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For since every wilful Act of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi> binds Men over to Eternal Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and since nothing but <hi>Restitution,</hi> so far as they are able, can release and absolve them from that dire Obligation; it necessarily follows, that he who deals unjustly by others without any Intent of making them <hi>Restitution,</hi> doth by his <hi>own Act</hi> wilfully oblige himself to endure an Eternal Punishment. For he knows that what he gaineth <hi>unjustly</hi> from another must be <hi>restored,</hi> or his <hi>Soul</hi> must be lost; and therefore if he resolve upon that Gain without any Intent to <hi>restore</hi> it, he doth in effect stake his <hi>Soul</hi> to it, and freely oblige himself to endure Hell-fire for ever, in consideration of the <hi>present Gain</hi> he acquires by his unjust dealing. For he who knows that such a <hi>Potion,</hi> however sweetened and made palatable, is compounded with the Juice of Deadly
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34683:80"/>
                  <hi>Nightshade,</hi> and yet wilfully swallows it without any intent to disgorge it again, doth thereby <hi>voluntarily</hi> murder and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy himself: and so He who knows that such an <hi>unjust Gain,</hi> how tempting so ever it may look for the present, hath an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting <hi>Horror</hi> and <hi>Anguish</hi> intermingled with it, and yet wilfully <hi>seises</hi> it without any intent to <hi>refund</hi> it; doth freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to undergo the <hi>Evil</hi> to enjoy the <hi>Good</hi> of it, and shake hands upon this desperate Bargain, that upon condition he may reap such an <hi>unlawful Profit,</hi> he will freely surrender up his <hi>immortal Soul</hi> to the Pangs and Agonies of <hi>Eternal Death.</hi> For in every Temptation to deal unjustly the <hi>Devil</hi> cheapens our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Soul, and the <hi>unlawful Gain</hi> with which he tempts us is the <hi>Price</hi> he bids for it: and though sometimes he bids exceeding <hi>low,</hi> yet if we take his Price, though it be but a <hi>Penny,</hi> we thereby strike the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Bargain,</hi> and by our own Act and Deed consign and deliver our <hi>Souls</hi> to him to be his Slaves <hi>here,</hi> and his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs <hi>hereafter.</hi> And what greater mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness can a Man be guilty of, than to sell his <hi>Soul</hi> and all his Hopes of <hi>Happiness</hi> for ever, for the trifling and momentary Gains of an <hi>unjust Action?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:34683:80"/>III. CONSIDER the manifest <hi>Inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusableness</hi> of <hi>Injustice</hi> in it self: For, as I have shewed you at large, all Justice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Man and Man is reducible to that general Rule <hi>Do as you would be done by; i. e.</hi> Do all that good to others, which you could reasonably expect they should do to you, if you were in their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, and they in yours: and this is so plain a Rule, that no Man can plead <hi>Ignorance</hi> of it, who doth not wilfully shut his own Eyes. 'Tis true, whilst <hi>Laws,</hi> though never so <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>useful</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, are yet <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>perplex'd</hi> in their Promulgation, or <hi>over-numerous,</hi> they may prove a Snare, rather than a Guide, and make more Controversies than they can decide, and lose much of their force by being spun out into <hi>nice</hi> and <hi>subtile</hi> Disputes: they may fall <hi>short</hi> of their aim, by not being able to reach the greater part of those Persons whom they designed to direct; who either have not <hi>Leisure</hi> sufficient to attend to, or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities</hi> to understand them, or <hi>Sagacity</hi> to apply them in all opportunities of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. But as for this <hi>General Rule</hi> of Justice, it is always at hand, and we car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it about us in our own Breasts: for this is the <hi>peculiar</hi> advantage of this Rule,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34683:81"/>
that by it we may very <hi>easily</hi> discern all the Specialities of our Duty, without looking abroad, or having recourse to external Instructions. So that by it we may be perfect Lawgivers, skilful Judges, and faithful Casuists to our <hi>own Souls:</hi> For it is Legible to those that have no <hi>Letters,</hi> and lieth open and obvious to the most <hi>Rude</hi> and <hi>Ignorant.</hi> We need not search ancient <hi>Records,</hi> or dark <hi>Repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitories,</hi> revolve and ruminate upon old <hi>Sentences,</hi> or new <hi>Glosses,</hi> or rove about the World to examine the various <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> of Countries: we need not soar to <hi>Heaven,</hi> or dive to <hi>Hell</hi> in quest of our Duty; for if we will but return into our <hi>Selves,</hi> and look into our own <hi>Hearts,</hi> there we may find it copied and ingraven in <hi>legible Characters.</hi> For when any Opportunity of dealing justly by <hi>another</hi> presents it self to us, it is but asking <hi>our selves</hi> how we would be dealt by in the <hi>same</hi> Circumstances; and our <hi>Answer</hi> to that is our <hi>Duty</hi> to those we deal with: I know very well how I should <hi>expect</hi> to be used if my Neighbour and I had <hi>changed Persons</hi> and Circumstances: my own Heart tells me, that I should think it reasonable to expect <hi>such measures</hi> from <hi>him,</hi> and that therefore he hath just
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34683:81"/>
Reason to expect the <hi>same</hi> from <hi>me.</hi> So that in most cases of Justice between Man and Man, every Man, if he pleases, may be his <hi>own</hi> Casuist: for it is but <hi>exchanging</hi> Persons, and Circumstances with his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> which is quickly done, and then applying this <hi>General Rule</hi> to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Dealings with him; and his <hi>own Heart</hi> will soon tell him what he is to do, and very rarely but never grosly misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him. For by thus <hi>changing</hi> the Scales, and making <hi>another</hi> Man's case my <hi>own,</hi> I take the fairest and readiest way to understand what is <hi>right</hi> and <hi>due</hi> to him: for now to be sure my <hi>Passion,</hi> and <hi>Self-interest</hi> will not incline me one way more than another; and even that <hi>Selfishness,</hi> which inclines me to wrong <hi>another</hi> Man for my <hi>own</hi> Advantage, will likewise render me unwilling, when the Scales are <hi>changed,</hi> that <hi>another</hi> Man should wrong me; and that <hi>Self-conceit,</hi> which makes me apt to scorn and despise <hi>another,</hi> will make me unwilling to be scorned and despised <hi>my self;</hi> and so when I consult my self how I would be dealt by, those very <hi>Passions</hi> which incline me to <hi>wrong others</hi> will instruct me to <hi>right them.</hi> So that there is no <hi>Rule</hi> in the World can be press'd with fewer <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrances,</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:34683:82"/>
or darkened with less <hi>Intrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> none that can lye open to larger <hi>Use,</hi> or be readier to present <hi>Application,</hi> or more obvious to all sizes of <hi>Apprehension</hi> than This, which is the <hi>Measure</hi> and <hi>Standard</hi> of our Dealings and Intercour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with one another. So that there is no pleading <hi>Ignorance</hi> to excuse, or palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate any great Violations of the Laws of Righteousness; since in all matters of moment every Man may easily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand how he ought to deal by every Man, if he would but take care to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult the Oracle in his <hi>own Breast,</hi> and ask himself how he would expect to be dealt by, were he placed in the Circumstances of those he deals with. And when Men wo'nt <hi>understand</hi> their Duty, when it lies so <hi>plainly</hi> before them; or wo'nt <hi>do</hi> their Duty, when they do <hi>understand</hi> it; what Colour of Excuse can be made for them? Were the <hi>Rule</hi> of our Duty so <hi>obscure</hi> as that we could not easily apprehend it, the Weakness of our <hi>Understanding</hi> might partly excuse the Error of our <hi>Wills,</hi> and render it <hi>pitiable</hi> and <hi>pardonable,</hi> though not altogether <hi>innocent;</hi> but when it lies so <hi>full</hi> in our <hi>View</hi> as that we cannot but discern it, if we will but open our Eyes, and fairly consult our own Minds and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34683:82"/>
Thoughts, our <hi>Understanding</hi> is acquitted, and our <hi>Will</hi> only is chargeable with our Folly, and Wickedness: so that now we sin at our <hi>own</hi> Peril, and leap headlong into mischief with our Eyes open. But as for <hi>Injustice,</hi> the Guilt of it is so open and visible, that however our other Sins may be excused by our <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and mitigated or connived at upon the score of the <hi>natural Defects</hi> of our <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> this can admit of no Cloak, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuation; because whenever a Man dealeth unjustly by another, his <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> will be sure to tell him (if he puts the question to it) that he would not be so dealt with, were the Case and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances <hi>his own.</hi> So that when we come to give up our Accounts at the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and to answer for our unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealings with one another, they will so stare us in the Face that we shall be able to make no Excuse or Apology for them; but our own Consciences will be forced to cry <hi>Guilty, Guilty,</hi> to anticipate our doom, and when it is past, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove and second it with a <hi>Iust and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous art thou, O Lord, in all thy ways.</hi> For when the <hi>Rule</hi> of Justice lies so very plain, and open to our very <hi>Faculties,</hi> what can be said if we do unjustly, but
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34683:83"/>
that we are obstinate and wilful and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible <hi>Robbers,</hi> that can claim no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, deserve no Pity, and pretend to no mitigation of our Stripes, since we <hi>knew</hi> our Master's Will and <hi>did it not?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. CONSIDER the <hi>Fruitlesness</hi> and <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievousness</hi> of unjust Dealing to <hi>our selves.</hi> For the usual bait of Injustice is <hi>Gain</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> we deplume our <hi>Neighbour</hi>'s Wings with an intent to Feather <hi>our own Nests,</hi> and invade <hi>other</hi> Mens Properties to enrich <hi>our selves</hi> with their Spoils: This is the <hi>common Game</hi> that Fraud and Oppression pursues and flies at, though usually they fly short or beyond it, and instead of enriching Men do finally damage and impoverish them. For how successful soever unjust Dealing may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prove to the <hi>raising</hi> a Man's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Estate, 'tis in its natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency an effectual way to <hi>impair</hi> and <hi>ruin</hi> it; because by dealing unjustly he makes it every Man's Interest to forsake and abandon him, and in effect sets a Cross upon his own Door to warn all Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers from entring. For who would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have to do with a <hi>Knave,</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways lies upon the Catch, waiting Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to Rook and Cozen him; with whom he can neither speak, nor act
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34683:83"/>
securely, but must be forced to stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own <hi>guard</hi> with him, and treat him with the same <hi>Circumspection</hi> and <hi>Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> as Conjurers do their Devils, for fear of being snapt and torn in pieces by him? And how is it possible for a Man to <hi>thrive,</hi> when no body cares to <hi>deal</hi> with him; when his House is haunted, and his <hi>Frauds</hi> and <hi>Cozenages</hi> appear like Specters at his Door, to <hi>frighten</hi> all Men from his Shop and Conversation? And accordingly you see that Justice and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty in Dealing is so <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> to Mens thriving in the World, that even they who <hi>are</hi> not honest are fain to <hi>seem</hi> so: but for a Man to <hi>seem</hi> to be Honest there is no way so certain and secure, as to be <hi>really</hi> so; for if he be not, it is a thousand to one but the events of things will one time or other unmask and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover him. No Man can be secure of <hi>Privacy</hi> in an unjust Action, but let him carry it never so secretly and demurely, one Accident or other will draw the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and bring to light the <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Villany</hi> behind it: and when it doth, what will Men say? <hi>He has cheated me once, and that was his fault, but if he cheat me again it will be mine as well as his; and I shall richly deserve the second wrong, if I</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:34683:84"/>
                  <hi>will take no warning by the first.</hi> So that how much soever a Man may gain by a <hi>present</hi> Cheat, he is sure, if he be disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, to lose his Correspondent, by whom in a few years he might have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly gotten ten times more: besides that, either his <hi>Resentment</hi> of the Injury he hath received, or else his <hi>Charity</hi> to others will oblige him to <hi>divulge</hi> the knavery, and to <hi>warn others</hi> by it not to have any thing to do with the detected Knave that wrong'd and abus'd him. And when once a Man's <hi>Credit</hi> is blasted by the report of a foul and dishonest Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is a thousand to one but he will lose back in his <hi>Trade</hi> all that he gain'd by his <hi>Cheat,</hi> and twenty times more; and then if once he begin to sink, there is no recovering of him; for <hi>Estate</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi> are the two Wings that bear Men up in the World, and therefore if when he hath clipt the Wings of his <hi>Credit,</hi> his <hi>Estate</hi> should fail him too, he must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and sink without Remedy. For Credit is like a <hi>Looking-glass,</hi> which when only <hi>sullied</hi> by an unwholsome breath may be wiped clean again; but if once it is <hi>crack'd,</hi> it is never to be repaired. So that considering all, Fraud and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice is as great an Error in <hi>Politicks,</hi> as
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34683:84"/>
in <hi>Morals,</hi> and doth bespeak a Man to have as little <hi>Wit,</hi> as <hi>Honesty;</hi> and in plain <hi>English,</hi> to be as much a <hi>Fool,</hi> as a <hi>Knave.</hi> But suppose the best, and that which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens, that a Man should <hi>thrive</hi> by his <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Injustice,</hi> and grow <hi>great</hi> and <hi>prosperous</hi> in the World; alas! what <hi>Comfort</hi> can he take in his ill-gotten Wealth; when every part of it throws Guilt in his Face, and awakens some dire Reflection in his <hi>Conscience?</hi> For, as I shewed you before, of all Sins that of <hi>Injustice</hi> admits the least Excuse and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation; the sense of it clings so close to a Man's <hi>Conscience,</hi> that he can never pluck it off without pulling away his Conscience with it, and rooting out of his mind all the sense of <hi>Religion,</hi> and of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi> So that unless the Man turn an assured <hi>Atheist</hi> or a stupid <hi>Sot,</hi> it will be impossible for him to enjoy his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Possessions, without great <hi>Recoilings</hi> and <hi>Convulsions</hi> of Conscience; because his unjust Possessions will, like the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer's Bastard, be a <hi>standing Reproach</hi> to him, and a perpetual <hi>Remembrancer</hi> of his Guilt and Shame. And when that which a Man enjoys and lives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when the Meat which he gluts, and the Drink which he guzles, the Cloaths
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:34683:85"/>
which he rustles and flaunts in, shall thus <hi>reproach</hi> and <hi>upbraid</hi> him; O wretched Man! We are the Price of thy <hi>Innocence,</hi> thy <hi>Soul,</hi> and thy <hi>Eternal Happiness;</hi> for us thou hast damn'd thy self, and freely consign'd thy immortal Spirit to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Horror and Confusion; When his Bags and Coffers cry Guilty, Guilty, and he seeth a <hi>Mene Tekel</hi> on the Walls of every Room in his House, and every thing he enjoys <hi>whispers</hi> some Accusation against him; what <hi>Comfort</hi> can he take in the purchase of his Frauds and Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Were it not a thousand times better for him to have lived contentedly on a brown Morsel, than thus to fare delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously every day with a <hi>vex'd</hi> and a <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented</hi> Mind? And yet this is commonly the Fate of <hi>unjust Possessors,</hi> who under the disguise of a <hi>chearful</hi> Countenance too commonly wear <hi>woful</hi> Hearts, and like Tragedies bound in guilded Covers, are only gay and splendid <hi>without,</hi> but full of Stabs and Wounds <hi>within.</hi> But suppose that in a continued Tumult of Excesses and Riots, they should make a shift, whilst they <hi>live,</hi> to drown the Cries of their guilty Consciences; yet in all probability whenever <hi>Death</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, or approaches them in a Disease,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34683:85"/>
and sets them within ken of Eternity, their <hi>Conscience</hi> in despight of them will <hi>rouze</hi> and <hi>awake</hi> and raise a hideous <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry</hi> against them: for now their Last <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Testament</hi> will set before them a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Catalogue of uncancelled Guilts, and every ill-gotten Penny they have there bequeathed will put them in mind of their approaching <hi>Damnation;</hi> and dictate <hi>Dread,</hi> and <hi>Horror</hi> to their Consciences, which in a desperate rage will fly in their Faces and tell them to their Teeth that they are <hi>Cheats</hi> and <hi>Knaves</hi> and <hi>Reprobates;</hi> that their <hi>Legacies</hi> are the Fruits of their <hi>Sins,</hi> the purchase of their <hi>Frauds</hi> and <hi>Oppressions;</hi> and that for that which they are now bequeathing to <hi>other's,</hi> they have long ago bequeathed their <hi>Soul</hi> to the Devil, who now stands ready to seize on it and carry it, away to those dark Prisons of Horror where he keeps his miserable Slaves under a dreadful expectation of their <hi>Eternal Iudgment.</hi> So that should any Man chance to thrive, and grow rich by <hi>Injustice,</hi> yet 'tis a thousand to one but either <hi>living</hi> or <hi>dying,</hi> or <hi>both,</hi> his <hi>Riches</hi> will prove a far worse Plague to him than <hi>Poverty</hi> it self; and if so, who but a mad Man would ever abandon himself to a Folly so <hi>fruitless</hi> and <hi>mischievous?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:34683:86"/>Fifthly and Lastly, CONSIDER the high Provocation that <hi>Injustice</hi> gives to <hi>God.</hi> For <hi>God,</hi> as I have shewed you before, is the <hi>Author</hi> of all those Rights which Men are invested with, whether they be <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> or <hi>acquir'd:</hi> and being the <hi>Author</hi> of them, he is more especially obliged to <hi>assert</hi> and <hi>vindicate</hi> them, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his own Bequests and Donations, and not suffer those to go unpunish'd, who presume to purloin or alienate them from their <hi>rightful Owners.</hi> For he who wrongfully deprives a Man of any Right; deprives him of what <hi>God</hi> hath given him, snatches <hi>God's</hi> Goods out of those hands in which he hath trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and deposited them; and in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing robs <hi>God</hi> himself, and seises his Goods without his leave. So that every unjust Invasion of another's Rights is an Injury to <hi>God,</hi> who is the supreme Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, from whom all Right and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty descendeth. For since every <hi>Man's</hi> Right is derived from, and founded on the Right of <hi>God,</hi> whosoever trespasses on the <hi>one,</hi> must necessarily invade the <hi>other:</hi> all that is ours we hold by Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Right from the great Landlord of the World, whose <hi>supreme</hi> and <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Propriety</hi> is the Ground, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:34683:86"/>
on which all our just <hi>Claims</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> depend. He therefore who by Fraud or Violence dispossesses any Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>God,</hi> or seises any part of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty which <hi>he</hi> hath farmed out to him; doth in so doing eject the <hi>Landlord,</hi> as well as the <hi>Tenant,</hi> and so far as in him lies turn <hi>God</hi> out of his own World, and <hi>usurp</hi> his eternal Right and <hi>Dominion.</hi> And so long as he holds what God hath set to another, he holds not as a <hi>Tenant</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> but as a <hi>Robber</hi> and an <hi>Invader</hi> of him: when he seiz'd his unjust Possession, he snatch'd <hi>God's</hi> Goods out of his hands; and while he detains them, he doth in effect declare that he will keep <hi>God's</hi> Goods in despight of him; that as he hath already thrust him out of this part of his Creation, so he is resolved to keep him out as long as he is able, and never to permit him to re-enter upon it, so long as he can maintain and defend it against him. Since therefore we claim by <hi>God's</hi> own Tenure, and all our Rights do finally issue and resolve into <hi>his;</hi> he is peculiarly concerned to <hi>assert,</hi> and <hi>vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> them, because they are all <hi>his own.</hi> Hence is that passage quoted by St. <hi>Paul</hi> from God's own mouth, <hi>Vengance is mine and I will repay it,</hi> Rom. xii. 19. for what
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:34683:87"/>
is Vengeance, but only a <hi>Retribution</hi> of <hi>Punishments</hi> for Wrongs, and Injuries re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? And therefore since all Rights are <hi>God's,</hi> and consequently all Wrongs do redound upon <hi>him,</hi> Vengeance, or Retribution of Wrongs must necessarily be <hi>his Right</hi> and <hi>Prerogative;</hi> and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>his,</hi> he will be sure to repay it one time or other: and though he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it a while out of <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> Ends, yet in the long run it will appear that his <hi>Forbearance</hi> is no <hi>Payment</hi> and the longer he is repaying the <hi>Principal,</hi> the greater sum the <hi>Interest</hi> of his Vengeance will at last amount to. For what higher <hi>Outrage</hi> can you do to <hi>God</hi> who is an Immortal Being, infinitely removed from all Passion and Suffering, than to break in upon him as you do by every act of <hi>Injustice,</hi> and despoil him of his Goods, and rifle his House before his Face; to turn him out of Doors as it were, and shut up his own Creation against him; and in effect to tell him, that from henceforth you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to be your <hi>own God,</hi> to live at <hi>his</hi> Allowance no longer, but to carve and divide for <hi>your selves;</hi> and that so far as <hi>you</hi> are concerned, <hi>he</hi> shall have no more to do in <hi>his own</hi> World, but that you will supply his place in his Family, and order
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:34683:87"/>
his affairs, and dispose of his Goods, as you think convenient. Which is such an <hi>intolerable Indignity,</hi> as cannot but kindle a Resentment in the most <hi>indulgent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and arm even an <hi>infinite Patience</hi> with Thunderbolts: and accordingly if you consult either Sacred, or Prophane History, you will find that there is no one Sin which God hath so <hi>remarkably</hi> punished in this World, as this of <hi>Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> between Man and Man. For this he hath been observed, to plague not only the <hi>unjust Persons</hi> themselves with such Judgments, as have ecchoed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sounded their Crimes, but hath many times entailed a Curse upon their <hi>Posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi> which like a flying Scourge hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued them Generation after Generation, and marked their Descendants with dire Events, like a Coat of Arms charged with Crosses and Croslets: For this he hath pursued whole <hi>Nations</hi> to utter Ruin, and Desolation; and 'twas for this that he cut off his own People the <hi>Iews,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted his beloved <hi>Sharon</hi> into an eternal <hi>Desart.</hi> And if his Vengeance thus smoke against Injustice in <hi>this</hi> Life, which is the School of <hi>Discipline;</hi> how will it burn against it in the <hi>other,</hi> which is the Stage of <hi>Execution!</hi> If the <hi>Posterity</hi> of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34683:88"/>
be thus rack'd for it upon <hi>Earth,</hi> how will the Unjust <hi>themselves</hi> roar for it in <hi>Hell!</hi> In a word, if these <hi>temporary</hi> Flashes and Eruptions of God's Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance against Unrighteousness be so dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, how terribly must it flame against it within the bottomless <hi>Vulcano's</hi> of <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi> Burnings! Wherefore as you would not provoke an infinite Vengeance which you can neither withstand, nor endure; it concerns you diligently to avoid all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness in your Dealings, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse with Men; which if you take care to do, and to add to your <hi>Iustice Mercy,</hi> to your <hi>Mercy Sobriety,</hi> and to your <hi>Sobriety</hi> walking <hi>humbly</hi> with God, you shall be sure not only to escape his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance both here and hereafter, but also from these <hi>Seeds</hi> of <hi>Holiness</hi> to reap <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of <hi>Mercy,</hi> as it relieveth the Miseries of the Soul.</head>
               <p>AFTER the Consideration of <hi>Iustice,</hi> that of <hi>Mercy</hi> is to follow: And the proper Object of <hi>Mercy</hi> being <hi>Misery,</hi> it will be requisite in order to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of this Vertue, to consider what those human <hi>Miseries</hi> are which it relates to, and what are the particular <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> which belong to them. Now the <hi>Miseries</hi> which Men are liable to in this Life are reducible to these Heads: First, Either they are such as do affect their <hi>Souls;</hi> or, Secondly, Such as do affect their <hi>Bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. THE Miseries which do affect the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men; which may all be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under these five Heads: 1. <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> and <hi>Dejection</hi> of Mind. 2. <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Mistakes</hi> in matters of lesser Importance. 3. <hi>Blindness</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> in things of the greatest Moment. 4. <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy</hi> of Will in destructive and mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Courses. 5. <hi>Impotency</hi> or <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Power</hi> to free and recover themselves of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:34683:89"/>I. ONE of the Miseries which affect Mens Souls is <hi>Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Dejection</hi> of Mind, which like a Consumption in the Body, preys upon the Soul, dispirits its faculties and renders them <hi>faint</hi> and <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid</hi> in all their Operations. <hi>By Sorrow of the heart,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, the Spirit is broken.</hi> Prov. xv. 13. And indeed <hi>Sorrow</hi> is that <hi>Sense</hi> of the Soul by which it <hi>feels</hi> and <hi>perceives</hi> its own <hi>Miseries,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it could no more be affected with calamitous things, than Iron is with the blows of the Hammer. This is the <hi>Sting</hi> by which all sad Accidents do wound and inflame our Spirits, and with which the least trifle in the World can make us miserable in the most prosperous State, and turn all our Enjoyments into Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood. <hi>Sorrow</hi> therefore and <hi>Dejection</hi> of mind being the Point and Edge of all our <hi>Miseries,</hi> is upon that account a most <hi>proper</hi> Object of Mercy; whose peculiar Province it is to ease and relieve the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable. Whensoever therefore we do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with the Sorrowful and Dejected, the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> requires us to do what we can to <hi>support</hi> and <hi>relieve</hi> them; and that first by sympathizing with them, by sharing their Griefs, condoling their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and pitying their Calamities, or as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34683:89"/>
the Apostle expresses it, <hi>Rom.</hi> xii. 15. <hi>By weeping with those that weep;</hi> which up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>first</hi> breaking out of a great Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is the properest <hi>Remedy</hi> we can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister. For when a Passion is in its <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Fury,</hi> it is no more to be paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd with <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Discourse,</hi> than the Northern Wind is with a Lecture of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation; and till it hath <hi>tired</hi> it self a while with the <hi>Transports</hi> of its own Rage, to endeavour to check it with <hi>Arguments</hi> would be as vain an Attempt, as to damn up the <hi>Cataracts</hi> of <hi>Nile</hi> with a Hurdle; which instead of <hi>suppressing</hi> their Violence would but cause them to roar the louder, and to swell and break forth into <hi>more impetuous</hi> Torrents. The best Course therefore that can be taken at present, is to <hi>humour</hi> and <hi>gratify</hi> the Passion by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doling with it the Calamity which caused it. For as the <hi>fiercest</hi> Creatures are most easily tamed by <hi>gentle</hi> management, by soothing and stroaking and being kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treated; so the best Expedient to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate <hi>violent</hi> Sorrows is to <hi>sooth</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge</hi> them till their Violence is abated; to conform our selves to them, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle our Tears and Lamentations with them. And accordingly we find that to be <hi>pitied</hi> and <hi>condoled</hi> is a real Ease and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34683:90"/>
Comfort to the <hi>miserable;</hi> and that so far as we <hi>partake</hi> with other Mens Griefs, we do translate 'em out of their Breasts into our <hi>own:</hi> So that by sympathizing with them we take part of their Sorrows from them, which like Dimensions may be so divided by us, as to become at least <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible,</hi> if not <hi>indivisible.</hi> Wherefore since 'tis not the Tears of their <hi>own</hi> Eyes only, but of their <hi>Friends</hi> Eyes too, that do exhaust the Current of their Griefs; which falling into many Streams will run more peaceably, and by degrees contract themselves into narrower Channels; it is an Act of <hi>Mercy</hi> that we owe to the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful to <hi>condole</hi> and <hi>sympathize</hi> with 'em in their Afflictions. And not to do so, or instead of that, to be either insensible of their Sorrows, or to take no other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them, but to <hi>mock</hi> at, and <hi>deride</hi> them, is a certain Argument of a <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>barbarous</hi> Temper. And as we ought to <hi>sympathize</hi> with them in their Sorrows, so, when they are capable of it, we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by the Laws of <hi>Mercy</hi> to use our best endeavour to <hi>support</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> them under their heaviness, as the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 4. sometimes by lessening and extenuating their Affliction, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by applying to them the Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34683:90"/>
of Religion, sometimes by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to them the evil of immoderate Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and sometimes by diverting them with innocent Pleasantry, and Chearfulness. For <hi>Sorrow</hi> diverts the mind from all <hi>comfortable</hi> thoughts, and like a black Perspective-Glass represents all Objects mournfully and tragically: So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>others</hi> will have Mercy on it and thrust Comforts into its Mouth, it will have no Mercy on <hi>it self,</hi> but sit pining and languishing under incessant Grief and Discontentedness. Wherefore to <hi>chear</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> dejected and sorrowful minds, is both a <hi>great</hi> and a <hi>necessary</hi> Act of <hi>Mercy;</hi> as on the contrary for any Man cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly to afflict and grieve another, to add Weight to his Sorrows and Wormwood to his Gall, and take Pleasure in his Griefs and Vexations, is not only <hi>inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> but <hi>diabolical:</hi> For to rejoyce in the Afflictions, and recreate with the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the miserable, is the blackest Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter that can be given to a <hi>Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. ANOTHER of the <hi>Miseries</hi> which affect Mens Souls is the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes</hi> they are liable to in matters of less Importance. The Understandings of Men are naturally weak and short-sighted, apt to be imposed upon by <hi>shews</hi> of Truth, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34683:91"/>
swallow <hi>Lies</hi> for Realities, when they are guilded with a fair Probability: And tho' we make loud boasts of <hi>Certainty</hi> and <hi>Demonstration,</hi> yet, God knows, many times our <hi>Certainties</hi> are the Dictates of our wild <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and our <hi>Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> prove nothing but our own <hi>Confidence.</hi> For <hi>Prejudice, Error</hi> and <hi>Inadvertency</hi> are as incident to our Minds, as <hi>Diseases</hi> are to our Bodies; and there are certain <hi>Springs</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> in all Mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, which do render them liable to be turned about by <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> Impulses. And generally our <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> are apt to creep into and mingle with our <hi>arguings,</hi> so that in most of our Disputes the <hi>Argument</hi> on both sides is commonly <hi>lost,</hi> and the Controversy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termins in a Conflict of <hi>Affections.</hi> And in a word, the Generality of Men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterably <hi>determined</hi> in their Opinions by their <hi>Fear</hi> or their <hi>Hope,</hi> or their <hi>Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices,</hi> or the Prepossessions of their <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> which, like so many Whirl-pools, having once sucked a Man in, do most commonly keep his head under Water, and never permit him to emerge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover himself: And if the Prejudices of our <hi>Education</hi> happen to be false, in all our <hi>Reasonings</hi> from them we do only spin
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34683:91"/>
out one Error from another, and so our Thoughts wander in a Labyrinth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the farther we go, the more we lose our selves. And as our <hi>Understandings</hi> are very <hi>dimsighted,</hi> so the <hi>Paths</hi> wherein we seek after Truth, are commonly very <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>intricate:</hi> For whilst we rack our Brains with nice and curious Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we generally but delude our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with the little Images and airy Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasms of things; while we weary our Eyes with laborious Reading, our Books prove oftner the <hi>Tombs,</hi> than the <hi>Shrines</hi> of Truth; and while we pursue it through the stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Seas of Controversy, there we are tossed with endless Doubts and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which like the rolling Waves crowd one upon the neck of another. And thus we grope to and fro in the dark, and 'tis a very great Acquist if in our Search after <hi>Knowledge</hi> we do but discover our own <hi>Ignorance.</hi> 'Tis true, as for those neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Truths which are the <hi>Fundamentals</hi> of our everlasting Well-being, God hath taken care to propose them to us in so <hi>clear</hi> a Light, that no Man can be ignorant of them who sincerely inquires after them: But commonly the <hi>remoter</hi> any Truth is from a necessary Article, the <hi>less plain</hi> and <hi>obvious</hi> it is to our Understanding; and therefore if in <hi>these</hi> we do err and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34683:92"/>
it is not to be wondered at, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how weak our Understanding is, and what disadvantageous Prospect it hath. And tho' <hi>these</hi> our <hi>mistakes</hi> are many times caused by a corrupt <hi>Biass</hi> in our Wills, by a factious Prejudice, or an overweening Self-conceit, by a carnal Interest, or a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine Neglect of the means of a better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; which according as they are more or less <hi>wilful,</hi> do render our Errors Sins of <hi>Infirmity,</hi> or damnable <hi>Heresy:</hi> Yet very often they are merely the Effects of a <hi>weak-sighted</hi> Mind, that is either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably seduced with fair <hi>Shews,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocently tinctured with false <hi>Prejudices:</hi> And in this case they are not our <hi>Crimes,</hi> but our <hi>Miseries.</hi> For we can no more be obliged not to <hi>err</hi> in our Opinions, than not to be <hi>sick</hi> or <hi>hungry;</hi> all that we are bound to is to understand as well as we <hi>can,</hi> and if when we do so, we should happen to be deceived, we have a just claim to <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Commiseration.</hi> And the proper Acts of <hi>Mercy</hi> which this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable Case requires are <hi>first Forbearance</hi> and <hi>Toleration; with all lowliness and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with longsuffering, forbearing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in love;</hi> as the Apostle expresses it, <hi>Ephes.</hi> iv. 2. that is, abstaining from all harsh Judgments and severe Censures,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34683:92"/>
from all peevish Separations from our Communion and Charity, and mutually treating each other with all the Candor and Forbearance, Lenity and Indulgence that a pitiable Case requires and deserves. For if I am in the right, and my Brother in the wrong, to be sure it is <hi>my Happiness,</hi> and perhaps 'tis only <hi>his Misery;</hi> and what an unmerciful part is it for me to damn, or censure, or rigorously treat him, meerly because it is <hi>his</hi> lot to be <hi>miserable</hi> and <hi>mine</hi> to be <hi>happy?</hi> What if he hath had the ill Luck to have his Brains cast into a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent figure from mine, by reading diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Books</hi> or keeping different <hi>Company,</hi> or being prejudiced by a different <hi>Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> is it reasonable that I should hate or severely judge him, because he hath been <hi>unfortunate,</hi> and perhaps could no more prevent those little Errors wherein he differs from me, than he could the Moles on his Skin, or the different colour of his Hair and Complexion? What is this but to load the oppressed, and heap Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery upon Misery, which is the most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly Cruelty? In this case therefore the Laws of <hi>Mercy</hi> require us as private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, to <hi>bear</hi> with one another's mistakes, to make the most <hi>candid Iudgment</hi> and <hi>Construction</hi> of them, and interpret them in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:34683:93"/>
the most <hi>favourable</hi> sense; and not to separate from one another for Trifles, or fly out into Bitterness and Animosity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every little Opinion which we judge false and erroneous.</p>
               <p>II. ANOTHER Act of <hi>Mercy</hi> which this Case requires, is to endeavour by all <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> ways to <hi>rectifie</hi> one another's Mistakes. If I behold my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Understanding labouring under the misery of <hi>Error,</hi> Mercy will incline me, so far as I am able, to endeavour his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> and <hi>Recovery;</hi> an Error in the <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> being as great a misfortune, as a wound or a disease in the <hi>Body:</hi> and what merciful Mind can behold that noblest Part of a Man diseased and affected, without being strongly inclined to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister what it can towards its Health and Recovery? And as Mercy will <hi>incline</hi> us to it, so it will <hi>direct</hi> us to the properest Means of effecting it: for if it be <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Compassion</hi> that moves me to rectifie my Brother's Mistake, it will move me to endeavour it with the <hi>Spirit of Meekness,</hi> which as the Apostle assures us, <hi>Galat.</hi> vi. 1. is the most likely expedient to <hi>restore</hi> him; that is, calmly and compassionately to represent to him his Error, so as that he may see it is not my Design to <hi>expose</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:34683:93"/>
or <hi>upbraid</hi> him, to <hi>insult</hi> over his Folly, or to <hi>triumph</hi> in his Confutation; but merely to set his Understanding to <hi>rights,</hi> and to <hi>rescue</hi> it from the Mistakes in which it is unfortunately entangled. And this, if any thing, will dispose him to <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten</hi> to my Reasons, and <hi>make way</hi> for my Arguments to enter into his mind: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as by deriding his Error, or persecuting it with sharp and bitter <hi>Invectives,</hi> I shall engage his <hi>passion</hi> to defend it, as well as his <hi>Reason;</hi> for witty Jests and severe Sarcasms may <hi>provoke</hi> an Adversary, but will never <hi>convince</hi> him. And as Mercy will direct me to treat my erring Brother with <hi>Meekness</hi> and <hi>Compassion,</hi> so it will also instruct me not to <hi>teaze</hi> and <hi>importune</hi> him with perpetual Disputacity; for this will look rather like an affectation of <hi>wrangling</hi> with him, than a desire of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing</hi> him: but to wait the fairest <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities</hi> of remonstrating his Error to him, when he is most at leisure, and most <hi>disposed</hi> to attend to Reason and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For Errors, like Paper Kites, are many times raised and kept up in Mens minds, by the incessant Bluster of <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fierce Opposition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. ANOTHER of the <hi>Miseries</hi> which affect Mens Souls is <hi>Blindness</hi> and <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:34683:94"/>
in things of the greatest moment, which is doubtless one of the greatest Miseries that can happen to a <hi>Soul</hi> in this Life. For the Interests of <hi>Souls</hi> are <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,</hi> they being born to live happily or miserably for ever; and their Happiness depending upon the right use of their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and this upon their <hi>Knowledge</hi> how to use and determine it; it will be impossible for them to attain to eternal Happiness, or escape eternal Misery, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Knowledge</hi> to steer and direct them: so that whilst they are <hi>ignorant</hi> of those <hi>Truths,</hi> by which their Liberty is to be governed, and their Choices and Actions to be determined to eternal Happiness, they are under a very <hi>remote Incapacity</hi> of being happy. And what a miserable Case is this, to have an <hi>eternal Interest</hi> at stake, and not to <hi>know</hi> how to manage it? To be travelling on this narrow Line, or Frontier which divideth those boundless Continents of everlasting Happiness and Misery, and not to see one step of our way before us, nor to perceive whither we are going till we are gone beyond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery? Should you behold a <hi>blind Man</hi> walking upon the brink of a fatal Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, without any Guide to direct his steps, and secure him from the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:34683:94"/>
Danger, would not your Hearts ake and your Bowels yearn for him? Would you not call out to him and warn him of his Danger, and make all the hast you could to take him by the Hand and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to a place of Safety? And is it not a much more deplorable sight, to see a poor <hi>ignorant Wretch</hi> walking blindfold on the Brinks of <hi>Hell,</hi> and for want of sight to direct him Heaven-wards ready to blunder at every step into the Pit of Destruction? Can you behold such a miserable Object with a <hi>regardless</hi> eye, and yet pretend to <hi>Pity</hi> or <hi>Compassion?</hi> Can you sit still and see him cast himself into the mouth of such horrid and amazing Danger, without <hi>warning</hi> him of it, and endeavouring by the best <hi>Instructions</hi> you can give him to lead him off, and direct him to eternal Happiness? Surely did we but duely understand the Worth and the Danger of <hi>Souls,</hi> such a woful Spectacle could not but affect our Bowels, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to employ all our Power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of the Danger he is running into, and instruct him how to avoid it. For this is the proper Act of <hi>Mercy</hi> which this miserable Case calls for, <hi>viz.</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to dispel that <hi>fatal Ignorance</hi>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:34683:95"/>
which surrounds Men minds, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten them with all those Principles of <hi>Religion</hi> which are necessary to conduct them to eternal Happiness. For it is not so great a piece of Mercy to give a <hi>starving</hi> Man Bread, as it is to inform an <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> Sinner and feed his famished Mind with the Bread of Life; because without the former 'tis only his <hi>Body</hi> will die, whereas without the latter his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> will die for ever. When therefore we know any Persons to be grosly <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> of God and Religion, the Laws of <hi>Mercy</hi> require us to use all prudent means to <hi>instruct</hi> and <hi>inform</hi> them: and if they are in our power, as our <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> are, to take care to train them up in the fear and <hi>nurture of the Lord,</hi> to catechize and instruct them in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Faith, and season their Minds with the Principles of <hi>pure Religion;</hi> that so understanding their Duty, and the vast and indispensable <hi>Obligations</hi> of it, they may not leap blindfold into eternal Perdition. For whilst we train them up in <hi>Blindness</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> we do in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Predestinate them to <hi>eternal Ruin,</hi> and like those barbarous Parents that offered up their Children to <hi>Molock,</hi> devote them
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34683:95"/>
as so many Sacrifices to the Devil. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we stand obliged, not only in <hi>Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> who hath committed their Souls to our charge, and will one day require an account of them at our Hands; but also in <hi>Mercy</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> that they may not perish eternally for lack of knowledge; to take all possible care to <hi>instruct</hi> their minds in the Duties and Obligations of <hi>Religion.</hi> And as <hi>Mercy</hi> obliges us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct our <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> who are in our power and disposal, so it also obliges us to instruct <hi>others</hi> whom we know to be <hi>ignorant</hi> of God and their Duty; to take all fair opportunities to insinuate the Knowledge of Divine Things to them, and to cultivate their rude and barbarous Minds with the Principles of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> or at least where we cannot be admitted to do them this good Office <hi>our selves,</hi> or our endeavouring it may be looked upon as a piece of <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciness</hi> or <hi>Pedantry,</hi> to recommend their miserable Case to <hi>others</hi> who have more <hi>Authority</hi> with them, or from whose hands it may be better taken. For sure if we have any <hi>Mercy</hi> or <hi>Compassion</hi> in us, we cannot sit still, and see a miserable Wretch wandring in the dark upon the Confines of <hi>eternal Ruin,</hi> without endeavouring by
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:34683:96"/>
some way or other to <hi>reduce</hi> and <hi>light</hi> him back to Heaven. Hence 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 25, 26. 'Tis made a necessary act of Mercy, <hi>Meekly to instruct those that oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> that is, out of ignorance of the Gospel, <hi>if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the Truth, that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the Devil who are taken captive by him at his will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. ANOTHER of the <hi>Miseries</hi> which affect Mens Souls, is <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy</hi> of Will in mischievous and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive courses; which is doubtless one of the <hi>greatest Infelicities</hi> that can happen to a Man on this side Hell. For to be obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in mischievous courses is but one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from the forlorn Condition of a <hi>damned Soul,</hi> which being fixed and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to Evil by the invincible <hi>Obstinacy</hi> of its own will, lies under a <hi>fatal Necessity</hi> of being its own eternal Hell and Devil: so that every degree of <hi>Obstinacy</hi> in Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness is a nearer Approach to <hi>eternal Damnation,</hi> and will at last inevitably cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in it, if it be not stopped in its Course and Progress, and cured by a timely Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. Now what a deplorable sight is this, to see a <hi>wretched Soul</hi> obstinately pursuing his own destruction, and even
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34683:96"/>
                  <hi>forcing</hi> his way to Hell through all the resistances of his <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> together? Should you see a mad Man break loose from his Chain, and run his Head against a Wall, or catch up a Knife or Dagger and thrust it into his own Breast, and repeat Stab after Stab, in despight of all your Counsels and Dissuasives, would you not pity and lament his Case, and heartily wish him deprived of all that Liberty which he employs only to his own Destruction? And is it not a much more lamentable spectacle, to see a <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>desperate Soul</hi> break loose from those ties of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Conscience</hi> which bind it to its Duty and Happiness; and in a deaf and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Rage seize on the Weapons of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and plunge them into its own Bowels, and by <hi>repeated Acts</hi> of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness imbrue its hands in its own blood; whilst the blessed <hi>Spirit,</hi> with its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural sense of God, are strugling with it in vain, and fruitlesly endeavouring to disarm its desperate Fury, that it may not wound it self to eternal Death? What <hi>merciful</hi> Heart can forbear wishing, O would to God this miserable Soul had no Will, that it had not the Liberty to choose or act! Would to God it were a Stone,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:34683:97"/>
or a Tree that have no power to dispose of, or determine their own Motions, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than be thus left at liberty as it is, only to murder and destroy it self? But since to wish thus would be in vain, who that hath any Pity can sit still and see a miserable Wretch thus outrage himself, without endeavouring to hold his Hands, and bind him down with <hi>Reason</hi> and good <hi>Counsel?</hi> And this is the proper Act of <hi>Mercy</hi> which the miserable Case in hand requires, <hi>viz.</hi> When we see an <hi>obstinate Sinner</hi> resolutely pursuing his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, to endeavour, by prudent and seasonable <hi>Reproofs,</hi> by pious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate <hi>Counsels,</hi> and <hi>Admonitions,</hi> to reclaim him from the Error of his way. For thus our Holy Religion directeth us to <hi>exhort one another daily while it is called to day, least any of us should be hardened,</hi> i. e. irrecoverably hardened, <hi>through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness of sin.</hi> Heb. iii. 13. And how acceptable a work this is to God, St. <hi>Iames</hi> informeth us, Chap. v. 19, 20. <hi>Brethren if any of you err from the truth, and one convert him, let him know that he who converteth a Sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.</hi> Whereas by permitting Men to run on in their sins
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34683:97"/>
without any check or disturbance, under a pretence of <hi>Complaisance</hi> and <hi>Civility,</hi> is as much as to say; <hi>Sir, you are going head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to destruction, and go you are like for me; for my part whether you are damned, or saved, is much at one to me; if you are minded to make an experiment of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, much good may it do you; I know should I attempt to hinder or disturb you, you will think me rude and troublesome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rather than I will run the hazard, e'en let the Devil take you.</hi> And would it not be a high Complement, if you saw a Man plunging a Sword into his Bowels, to cry, <hi>Sir, I would hold your Arm, but that I am afraid you will be angry with me?</hi> 'Tis true, this merciful Work of <hi>Reproof</hi> and <hi>Admonition</hi> ought to be managed with a great deal of <hi>Caution:</hi> if the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we reprove be out of our power, we ought to observe the <hi>mollia tempora fandi,</hi> to forbear him till his Passion is down, or his intemperate Draught digested, till his Mind is <hi>sedate</hi> and <hi>calm,</hi> and best disposed to attend to and receive a pious <hi>Admonition:</hi> for he who reproves a Man when his Mind is disordered by <hi>Passion</hi> or <hi>Intemperance,</hi> doth but Preach Patience to a Northern Wind, which the more he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to resist, the lowder it will storm

and bluster. But then when he is fit to receive a <hi>Reprehension,</hi> we ought to give it with the greatest <hi>Privacy:</hi> If he offend in <hi>publick Conversation,</hi> where there are other Witnesses of it besides our selves, unless the matter be highly scandalous, it is sufficient for the present that we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press our Dislike of it by the Severity of our <hi>Looks,</hi> and the Seriousness of our <hi>Behaviour;</hi> and afterwards between him and our selves, to remonstrate to him the Folly and Danger of his Sin. For to reprove Men <hi>publickly</hi> looks more like <hi>Malice,</hi> then <hi>Mercy;</hi> especially till we have first made Trial of <hi>private Reprehensions,</hi> and found them ineffectual. But then with our Reproofs we ought to take care that we do not intermingle <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> or <hi>Drollery</hi> on the one hand, nor <hi>Passion,</hi> or sharp <hi>Invectives</hi> on the other; but that we perform this <hi>merciful</hi> Office with the greatest <hi>Modesty, Seriousness,</hi> and <hi>Compassion;</hi> first endeavouring to <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate</hi> the Offender's Displeasure, with kind and gentle Insinuations of our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Respect and Benevolence towards him; then representing his Crime to him with such a <hi>compassionate</hi> sense of the Evil and Danger of it, as may convince him that <hi>that</hi> which renders us so severe to
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34683:98"/>
his Sin, is nothing but mere <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> to his Soul: for to reprove a Man <hi>lightly,</hi> or <hi>passionately,</hi> looks more like a design to <hi>deride,</hi> or <hi>reproach</hi> him for his Sin, than to <hi>reclaim</hi> him from it. Lastly, we ought to take great care that the Matter we reprove him for be <hi>really culpable,</hi> that we do not reprehend him for any <hi>innocent</hi> Freedom, no nor for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>trifling</hi> Indecency; but only for <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>unquestionable</hi> Trespasses upon <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:</hi> lest he should look upon our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs as the language of a <hi>supercilious</hi> and <hi>morose</hi> Spirit, that affects to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer and find fault, and as such should despise and reject them. To avoid which it is highly adviseable, that while we <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove</hi> what is <hi>evil</hi> in him, we should <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend</hi> what is <hi>good;</hi> that so our bitter Pill being sweetened with a due Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, may be rendered more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latable, and so go down with less Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. But if the Offender whom we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove be under our <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to our <hi>Reproofs</hi> and <hi>Admonitions</hi> we are obliged in Mercy to add <hi>Correction,</hi> if Necessity requires: for when it is come to that pass, that our Child or Servant must <hi>smart</hi> or be <hi>damned,</hi> 'tis a cruel Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Indulgence, not to <hi>chastize</hi> him.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:34683:99"/>
Were your House on fire, you would think it a Mercy to be rescued from the Flames, though you were dragged out by the Hair of the Head: And when the Flames of <hi>Hell</hi> are kindling about your Child or your Servant, would it not be much more merciful to snatch him away, though with <hi>Smart</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> than to stand still and let him <hi>perish</hi> for fear of <hi>hurting</hi> him? 'Tis true, <hi>Correction</hi> ought not to be used till <hi>gentler Means</hi> have been tried and found <hi>ineffectual:</hi> For Blows are Arguments for <hi>Beasts,</hi> and for <hi>beastly</hi> Natures, fit only to be applied to stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and obstinate Tempers that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Persuasion:</hi> But when they are applied, it ought to be done with the greatest <hi>Tenderness</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion,</hi> when our Minds are <hi>calm,</hi> and our Passion <hi>allayed;</hi> that so the Offender may be sensible we do it not to wreak our <hi>Spleen,</hi> or vent and ease our <hi>Fury,</hi> but meerly to <hi>reclaim</hi> and <hi>amend</hi> him: The Sense of which will cause the Correction to operate more <hi>kindly</hi> in him, to affect his <hi>Ingenuity</hi> as well as his <hi>Fear,</hi> and to melt him with the <hi>Mercy,</hi> whilst it breaks him with the <hi>Severity</hi> of it: This therefore is the <hi>Mercy</hi> which we are obliged to exercise towards <hi>obstinate</hi> and <hi>stubborn</hi> Offenders.</p>

                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:34683:99"/>Fifthly and Lastly, ANOTHER of the <hi>Miseries</hi> which affect Mens Souls is <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency,</hi> or Want of <hi>Power</hi> to recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of their vicious Courses; for a <hi>vicious State</hi> doth so miserably <hi>weaken</hi> and <hi>disable</hi> Mens Faculties, so <hi>impair</hi> the health and vigour of their Minds, that it is not in their <hi>Power</hi> to help and recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of it. For to their Recovery it is necessary, first that their Thoughts should be determined to a fixed and exact <hi>Consideration</hi> of the Evil and Danger of their Sins, and of the blessed Hopes which God hath set before them to tempt them to renounce and forsake them: And then that these <hi>Considerations</hi> should so prevail upon and influence their <hi>Wills,</hi> as to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate them into a thorough Resolution of Amendment; both which Effects are out of the reach of the Sinners <hi>Power,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered singly, and without the concurrence of the <hi>Divine Grace.</hi> For his Mind is so <hi>depressed</hi> and <hi>bowed</hi> down towards these earthly and sensible Objects, which have been hitherto the sole Companions of his Thoughts, that it is not <hi>able</hi> to raise up it self to the <hi>Consideration</hi> of Divine Things: And though now and then, a good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation may break in upon him, and seize upon his Thoughts, yet it cannot hold

them a quarter of an hour together; they are so <hi>roving</hi> and <hi>slippery,</hi> so <hi>backward</hi> and <hi>averse</hi> to any thing that is <hi>serious</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine:</hi> So that unless the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> lays hold upon them, and by his <hi>powerful</hi> and <hi>importunate Inspirations</hi> confines and fixes them, the <hi>Man</hi> will never be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to any <hi>fast</hi> and <hi>steady Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> And when with the <hi>Holy Spirit's</hi> Assistance he hath effected this, he hath a <hi>perverse</hi> and <hi>obstinate</hi> Will to deal with; which no Considerations will be able to determin to a fixed Resolution of Amendment, but what are set home upon his Mind, and continually <hi>actuated</hi> and <hi>enlivened</hi> with the vigorous Influence of the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> So that of himself every habitual Sinner is a most <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>impotent</hi> Creature, that with all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> the utmost Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Struglings of his <hi>own Faculties</hi> is not able without a <hi>supernatural</hi> Aid to rescue himself from Sin and Misery. For how many sorrowful Instances do we every day converse with of Men, who in their <hi>sober Thoughts</hi> will sadly lament their own Follies; and blush in the morning when they remember how their Brains were set a float by their last Night's Intemperance; who yet when the <hi>next Temptation</hi> beckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

Why, besides all the above-named Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Mercy</hi> which we are obliged even for Pity's sake to apply to them; we are also bound in <hi>Mercy</hi> earnestly to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their woful Condition to the <hi>God</hi> of all Grace and Compassion, to beseech <hi>him</hi> to commiserate their Impotence, and with the out-stretched Arm of <hi>his Grace</hi> to touch their dead Souls, and raise them up into Newness of Life. For though in all Cases of Misery <hi>Prayer</hi> is a proper Act of <hi>Mercy,</hi> yet there is none that doth so much need and call for our Prayers as <hi>this:</hi> For in all <hi>other</hi> Cases, either it is in the Power of the <hi>Miserable</hi> to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or it is in the Power of the <hi>Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>

Wherefore if we have any Bowels of <hi>Mercy</hi> or <hi>Compassion</hi> in us, How can we sit still and see an impotent Sinner bound as it were to the stake of Perdition, and not able to escape, though he sees the Flames of Hell rising round about him; without lifting up our Eyes to <hi>God,</hi> in whom alone his <hi>Help</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> lyes, and earnestly imploring him to commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serate the perishing Wretch, and to snatch him from his approaching ruin? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Law of <hi>Mercy</hi> obliges us in general to pray for <hi>all</hi> that are in <hi>Misery,</hi> so more especially for these <hi>wretched Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> who are already within the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of endless Misery; and unless <hi>God</hi> stretches forth his Arm and saves them, will be within a few moments beyond the reach of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi> And thus you see what those Instances of <hi>Mercy</hi> are, which we are obliged to exercise towards the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men: And for the enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Duty herein, I shall subjoyn
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:34683:101"/>
some <hi>Considerations</hi> to excite our Christian Compassion.</p>
               <p>I. CONSIDER the inestimable <hi>Worth</hi> of those <hi>Souls,</hi> upon which your <hi>Mercy</hi> is to be employed. I confess, were the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men of the same alloy with their <hi>Bodies,</hi> whose highest Pleasures do consist in the gratification of a few brutish <hi>Senses,</hi> and are nothing else but the agreeable Touches of certain little Skins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which are as inconsiderable as a Lutestring; and which, after they have repeated these Pleasures some twenty or thirty years, do commonly expire into <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensibility</hi> and <hi>Rottenness;</hi> were, I say, their <hi>Souls</hi> of the <hi>same</hi> Make and Frame, it were not so much to be admired that we are so indifferently affected towards them. But these <hi>precious Beings</hi> are of a much nobler Constitution, their Faculties are made to relish <hi>Godlike</hi> and <hi>Angelical Delights,</hi> to drink for-ever of that Divine <hi>Nectar</hi> of <hi>Contemplation,</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and to feast upon those Joys with which God entertains <hi>himself,</hi> and all his <hi>Choir</hi> of <hi>Angels:</hi> And as they are born to much higher Pleasures and Enjoyments, than those wretched <hi>Bodies</hi> which inclose them, so they are also made for an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>longer Life</hi> and <hi>Duration:</hi> For they
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34683:102"/>
must live <hi>for ever</hi> in inconceivable Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness or Misery; and when their <hi>Bodies</hi> are mouldered into insensible Dust, be partaking either of the Raptures of <hi>Angels,</hi> or of the Horrors and Agonies of <hi>Devils.</hi> And can I think my self obliged in Mercy to feed and cloath the <hi>Body</hi> of my Child or Servant, the <hi>Body</hi> which within a few days in despight of all my Care and Pains will resolve into a Clod of stupid <hi>Earth!</hi> and yet be altogether unconcerned what becometh of that <hi>precious Soul,</hi> which must be the subject of an <hi>everlasting</hi> Happiness or Misery? Is it possible I should be so careful and sollicitous as I am, to heap up great <hi>Fortunes</hi> for my Children, that so they may swim in Plenty a few Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wear fine Cloaths, and fare deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously every day, and at last go down to the Worms with Pomp; and in the mean time neglect that <hi>immortal Being</hi> within them, which, when all the Wealth I provided for them is shrunk into six foot of Earth and a Winding-sheet, must be a <hi>glorified</hi> Spirit, or a <hi>damned</hi> Ghost! Sure did we but seriously consider, with what vast Capacities of Happiness or Misery the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men are framed and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, and what proportionable Fates do attend them; we should be much more
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34683:102"/>
solicitous than we are, not only to secure our <hi>own Souls,</hi> but also to make a time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provision for the <hi>Souls</hi> of our <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Relations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. CONSIDER how much you are interested and concerned in the Fate of the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> but especially of your <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> for in this state of <hi>Danger</hi> wherein we are placed, God hath committed us to one another's Care, with a strict Injunction that we should <hi>exhort one another daily, while it is called To day, least any of us be hardened through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulness of sin.</hi> Heb. iii. 13. And if when it is in our power to <hi>prevent</hi> it, we suffer our Brother to be irrecoverably hardened in his Sin, we are <hi>accountable</hi> for it at the Tribunal of God, who will one day severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charge us for this our cruel <hi>Unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> to our Brother, in suffering him to <hi>miscarry</hi> for ever, without admonishing him of his Danger, and endeavouring to <hi>rescue</hi> him from it by our <hi>charitable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi> and <hi>Persuasions:</hi> So that if we suffer him to fall by <hi>neglecting</hi> to exhort and admonish him, in all probability he will not fall <hi>alone,</hi> but pull <hi>us</hi> down along with him into <hi>Eternal Perdition.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it concerns us for our <hi>own</hi> sakes, so far as we have opportunity to discharge
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:34683:103"/>
all <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> towards the Souls of <hi>others;</hi> lest whilst <hi>they</hi> perish through <hi>our Neglect,</hi> we should be <hi>involved</hi> in their Ruin. But then as for our <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> their Souls are more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed to our <hi>Care</hi> and Conduct, as being placed under our <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi> by God's over-ruling Providence; which by bestowing them upon us, and placing them with us, doth in effect thus bespeak us: <hi>These precious Souls I intrust in your hands, to be educated and trained up to Eternal Happiness: See you give me a good Account of them, for if they perish through your Neglect, whenever I make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition for Blood, I will certainly require it at your hands.</hi> How then shall we be able to lift up our Heads, when God shall demand of us, What are become of those <hi>precious Iewels</hi> which he committed to our trust? If through our barbarous <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect</hi> they should happen to be <hi>lost</hi> and <hi>forfeited</hi> to Eternal Misery; if through a wretched <hi>Regardlesness</hi> of their Eternal Interest, we have not instructed and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished them; if through a cruel <hi>Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Indulgence</hi> we have not reproved and corrected them; or if by our wicked <hi>Connivance</hi> or <hi>Example</hi> we have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and soothed them up in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34683:103"/>
course of Action; and so they should finally miscarry. Lord, what a <hi>dreadful Account</hi> shall we have to give, when we come to appear at thy Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal! Where the Blood of our <hi>Children</hi> and our <hi>Servants</hi> Souls shall join with our own <hi>Personal Guilts,</hi> to cry aloud for Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance against us. Wherefore if we have no Pity or Compassion for <hi>them,</hi> yet let us at least be so merciful to <hi>our selves,</hi> as not to omit those <hi>Offices</hi> of <hi>Mercy,</hi> which we are obliged to render to them.</p>
               <p>III. CONSIDER what a mighty Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence your <hi>Mercy</hi> may have upon their <hi>Welfare.</hi> It is not to be imagined how many Souls might be saved from perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, were we but so <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> as to distribute the <hi>Bread</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, according as we have Ability and Opportunity: How many a <hi>dark</hi> Mind might be <hi>enlightened</hi> by our sound and pious <hi>Instructions?</hi> How many a <hi>head-strong</hi> Will might we <hi>curb</hi> and <hi>restrain</hi> by our prudent and seasonable <hi>Reproofs</hi> and <hi>Admonitions?</hi> And how can we tell, but these our merciful Endeavours may, through the Concurrence of Divine <hi>Grace,</hi> prove blessed means of their final <hi>Recovery</hi> and <hi>Happiness?</hi> And if so, What better <hi>Office</hi> can we do in the World; or what
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:34683:104"/>
higer <hi>Dignity</hi> can we aspire to, than to be the Saviours and Redeemers of <hi>Souls?</hi> And if by our <hi>Instructions</hi> and <hi>Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> we might do so much good in our common <hi>Conversation</hi> among Men; How much more might we do in our own <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies?</hi> For our Children and Servants being under our <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> will upon that account receive our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions with greater <hi>Awe</hi> and <hi>Reverence;</hi> and consequently comply with them with greater <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Readiness.</hi> And then we having the Conduct of their <hi>young</hi> and <hi>tender</hi> Years, in which their Minds and Manners may be easily <hi>shaped</hi> in any Form, it is in our Power to stamp upon them what Impressions we please: So that would we but <hi>now</hi> take Care to instruct their <hi>Minds,</hi> and regulate their <hi>Wills,</hi> with wise and good <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Admonitions,</hi> we might easily impregnate their Natures with strong dispositions to <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi> and so by degrees cultivate those Dispositions into a State of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual Goodness.</hi> And when this blessed Effect is so much in our <hi>Power,</hi> what a <hi>cruel Neglect</hi> is it not to contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it so far as we are able? Should you see a <hi>Mother</hi> deny a morsel of Bread to her famished <hi>Child,</hi> when she hath <hi>enough</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:34683:104"/>
and to <hi>spare;</hi> or strip it stark <hi>naked</hi> in a deep Winter's Frost, and <hi>expose</hi> it to the Mountains to be starved with <hi>Cold;</hi> Would you not brand her for a <hi>Monster</hi> of her Sex, and exclaim against her with the greatest <hi>Detestation</hi> and <hi>Abhorrence?</hi> And yet alas! that <hi>unnatural Cruelty</hi> which we should so much abhor in another, we our selves are too often guilty of in a much <hi>higher</hi> Degree. For by neglecting to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct</hi> and <hi>educate</hi> our Families in Religion, we deny them the most <hi>necessary</hi> thing in the World, even that which is the Food and Raiment of their <hi>Souls;</hi> without which they cannot <hi>live,</hi> but must necessarily <hi>starve</hi> and <hi>famish</hi> for ever: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by how much more precious their <hi>Souls</hi> are than their <hi>Bodies,</hi> and by how much more deplorable <hi>eternal</hi> Death is than <hi>temporal,</hi> by so much more barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and inhumane are <hi>those</hi> Parents, who do not institute their Children in <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> than those who suffer them to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish with <hi>Hunger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> or <hi>Cold.</hi> For are you such Infidels as to imagine, that they are born only for <hi>this Life,</hi> and that there is nothing beyond the Grave in which they are concerned? If not, What account can you give of this your <hi>unnatural</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of them? If you think they must
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:34683:105"/>
live for ever when they are gone out of this World, Why then do not you take care that they may live in the other World as well as in this? O Improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that we are! Can we be so much concerned that they may be happy for a <hi>Moment,</hi> and yet so indifferent whether they are happy or miserable <hi>for ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Are their <hi>Souls</hi> such Trifles, or their <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi> Fate such an Indifferent Matter, as that when it is so much in your Power, you think it not worth your while to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern your selves so much about them? Wherefore in the Name of God, consider with your selves, what an infinite deal of <hi>Good</hi> you are capable of doing them by your Pious <hi>Instructions</hi> and <hi>Admonitions;</hi> and what an unnatural <hi>Barbarity</hi> it would be to omit and neglect it.</p>

And indeed our <hi>Body</hi> being an Object of <hi>Sense</hi> is usually much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked and taken notice of, than our <hi>Soul</hi> which is an <hi>invisible</hi> Being; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the <hi>Defects</hi> and <hi>Blemishes</hi> of our <hi>Bodies</hi> lying more in view, are much more liable to be reflected on both by our selves and those we converse with, than the <hi>Stains</hi> and <hi>Deformities</hi> of our <hi>Minds</hi> and <hi>Wills;</hi> which being placed out
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:34683:106"/>
of sight are less exposed to Observation: Which is the reason that our Corporeal <hi>Defects</hi> are so <hi>grievous</hi> to us, because be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so apparent as they are both to our own and others Senses, they do not only upbraid us to our <hi>selves,</hi> who being led by <hi>Sense</hi> are apt to value our selves by <hi>sensible</hi> Graces and Perfections; but are also prone to create a mean and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible Opinion of us in the Minds of <hi>others;</hi> the very suspition of which, if we are not <hi>raised</hi> above such <hi>mean Considerations,</hi> will be exceeding apt to grieve and afflict us. In this case therefore the Law of <hi>Mercy</hi> requires us not to <hi>contemn</hi> or <hi>undervalue</hi> Men, not to <hi>upbraid</hi> or <hi>reproach</hi> them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of any <hi>bodily</hi> Blemish or Defect; but to over-look these as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable Flaws of their <hi>Case</hi> and <hi>Outside,</hi> and render them all those Honours and Respects which the Graces and Vertues of their <hi>Minds</hi> deserve: Considering that the <hi>Body</hi> is not the Man, but the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Mind</hi> that inhabits it; and that many times the richest Diamonds wear the roughest Coats and Outsides; that those natural Blemishes are <hi>Infelicities</hi> which Men could not <hi>prevent,</hi> and which they cannot <hi>rectify;</hi> that it was not in <hi>their</hi> Power to order <hi>Nature</hi> in their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34683:106"/>
but that what they had there, was such as they could neither <hi>give</hi> themselves, nor yet <hi>refuse,</hi> when it was bequeathed to them; and that therefore to deride and expose them for any Mishape or Blemish in their Composition, is to fling <hi>Salt</hi> into their Wounds, to <hi>fret</hi> and <hi>inflame</hi> their Misery. And yet alas! How common a Practice is this to sport with the Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Men, as if <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> had designed them for so many Finger-buts of <hi>Scorn</hi> and <hi>Derision;</hi> to make them the Themes of our Jests and Laughter; which is a lamentable instance of the foul De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy of Humane Nature, that can thus <hi>play</hi> upon Misery, and turn that which is an Object of <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Compassion,</hi> into a Triumph of <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Drollery:</hi> for certainly how light and trifling soever it may appear through the common Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it, it is a sign of <hi>barbarous Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature</hi> for Men to deride those Defects and Blemishes in another, which he is too prone to grieve at, but yet cannot help, as being his <hi>Infelicities</hi> and not his <hi>Faults.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II ANOTHER of the <hi>Miseries</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Mens Bodies is <hi>Sicknesses</hi> and <hi>Diseases;</hi> by which the strength of our Natures is gradually exhausted, the Vigour of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:34683:107"/>
our Spirits wasted, the Activity of our Parts cramp'd and abated, and our <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> are rendered through incessant Pains and Weakness not only <hi>useless,</hi> but <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensom</hi> to our <hi>Souls.</hi> In this case there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> requires of us to render to our sick Friends, Neighbours and Acquaintants all such good Offices as do any way conduce to their <hi>Support, Refreshment,</hi> or <hi>Recovery.</hi> As first, if their Sickness be such as will safely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of <hi>Discourse</hi> and <hi>Conversation,</hi> we are obliged in Mercy to <hi>visit</hi> them, provided that our Company will be acceptable; and to endeavour by our Discourse to <hi>chear</hi> their drooping Spirits, to intermix their sorrowful Hours with the Pleasures of good <hi>Conversation,</hi> and to administer to their wearied Thoughts the <hi>Supports</hi> and <hi>Comforts</hi> of Religion. For chearful and good <hi>Discourse</hi> is many times better than the richest <hi>Cordial,</hi> it makes the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient</hi> to forget his pain, or at least allays and mitigates his Sense of it; it diverts his thoughts from their sorrowful Themes, and entertains them with brisk and spright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Idea's;</hi> it raises the languishing Heart, and like <hi>David's</hi> Musick, charms the rage of those evil Spirits which infest it with their unnatural Heats. So that by <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:34683:107"/>
our sick Friends; when they are willing to admit of our Conversation, and able to bear it, we many times prove their best <hi>Physicians,</hi> and administer to them the greatest <hi>Relief</hi> and <hi>Ease;</hi> and therefore if when we might do them so much good by our Company, we need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly <hi>withdraw</hi> or <hi>absent</hi> our selves from them, we are very much <hi>wanting</hi> in our <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> towards them. But then as we are obliged in Mercy to <hi>visit</hi> them, when their case will safely and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently admits of it; so we are also obliged by the same Mercy to render them all those necessary <hi>Assistances,</hi> which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their <hi>Souls</hi> or <hi>Bodies</hi> do require and need; to endeavour to awaken their Minds into <hi>serious</hi> Thoughts and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, to advise them of their <hi>Duty,</hi> and to resolve their <hi>Doubts,</hi> to comfort and support them with the blessed <hi>Hopes</hi> of Religion, and to take all fair Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to prepare their Souls for a happy <hi>Death</hi> and a glorious <hi>Eternity;</hi> that so whether they recover or no, this tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary Sickness of their <hi>Bodies</hi> may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the eternal Health of their <hi>Souls.</hi> And then in order to their Recovery, we stand bound by the Laws of Mercy to contribute what we are able to their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:34683:108"/>
                  <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Refreshment;</hi> to be ready to <hi>serve</hi> them in all their Necessities, and to <hi>help</hi> them when they cannot help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; to <hi>compassionate</hi> their Griefs, and <hi>bear</hi> with their Pevishnesses, and to the best of our knowledge to <hi>direct</hi> them to the ablest Physicians, or the most suitable Means; and if they are poor and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, to <hi>supply</hi> them with all such Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies as are necessary to their Health and Recovery: and lastly, to be their earnest <hi>Advocates</hi> at the Throne of Grace, that the God of all Power and Goodness in whose hands are the issues of Life and Death, would commiserate their Sorrows and refresh their Weariness, and either <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move</hi> their Sickness, or <hi>Sanctifie</hi> it to their Eternal Health.</p>
               <p>III. ANOTHER of the <hi>Miseries</hi> which affect Mens Bodies is outward <hi>Force,</hi> and <hi>violence</hi> from those in whose power they are; such as <hi>Captivity</hi> and <hi>Imprisonment, Persecutions</hi> or cruel <hi>Torments;</hi> all which do importunately sollicite the timely Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cors of our <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Compassion.</hi> For so for the <hi>first</hi> of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Bondage and and Captivity, it is a sore and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive Misery that commonly draws a long and heavy Chain of Calamities after it: for 'tis not only a <hi>Deprivation</hi> of our
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:34683:108"/>
Liberty, which is one of the dearest of all our temporal Blessings, but also a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscation</hi> of it into the Hands and disposal of our Enemies: and when our Persons are exposed to the will and tyranny of our Enemies, what can be expected from them in this degenerate state of Humane Nature, but a cruel and barbarous usage; to be worn out with Stripes and Hunger and intolerable Labour, and be forced to pine away our wretched Lives in unpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied Anguish and Vexation of Soul; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if those whom we are enslaved to happen to be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Enemies to our Religion, as well as Country; which is the case of those miserable <hi>Captives</hi> with whom our Mercy is most concerned; who being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of those that are sworn Enemies to the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> must up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account expect to be treated with much more Rigour and Severity; there being no Enmity so <hi>fierce</hi> and <hi>cruel,</hi> as that which is backed and set on by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> and enraged with <hi>zeal</hi> for <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> And when Men are ill treated not only as they are <hi>Slaves,</hi> but as they are <hi>Christians,</hi> what a hazardous <hi>Temptation</hi> are they under to renounce their Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and to exchange their hopes of Heaven for their Liberty, and to enslave
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:34683:109"/>
their <hi>Souls</hi> to Ransom their <hi>Bodies?</hi> And when both their Souls and Bodies are thus exposed to Wretchedness and Misery, what woful Circumstances can render them more proper Objects of our <hi>Mercy?</hi> Wherefore in this case we are obliged in <hi>Mercy,</hi> when any fair <hi>Opportunity</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to us, to <hi>contribute</hi> to their <hi>Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som</hi> proportionably to our Ability; and so far as it is consistent with the publick Benefit, to <hi>sollicit</hi> their Cause both with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Men;</hi> to beseech <hi>him</hi> to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and preserve them, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade all <hi>those</hi> with whom we have any Power or Interest, to a liberal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence towards their <hi>Relief,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND then as for <hi>Imprifonment,</hi> which is a sort of Captivity too, what a cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous Condition is it for a Man to be shut up in a close and unwholsom Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to dwell with Hunger and Cold, and be confined to a hard Lodging, a dark Solitude, or a wretched Company; to be sequestred from the Conversation of his Friends, from the Comforts of Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and from his Business and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all opportunities of making Provision for his poor Family? All which <hi>unhappy Circumstances</hi> do commonly meet
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:34683:109"/>
in the State and Condition of <hi>Prisoners,</hi> and render it exceedingly wretched and miserable. In which case the Mercy which is required of us is, first to <hi>visit</hi> them in this their uncomfortable Solitude and Confinement, supposing that they are our Friends and Acquaintants; and to endeavour by our Conversation to <hi>divert</hi> their Sorrows, to <hi>raise</hi> and <hi>strengthen</hi> their Hopes, and to <hi>chear</hi> them with fresh As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances of our Friendship; and then to use all just endeavours to <hi>mollifie</hi> their <hi>Adversaries,</hi> to <hi>vindicate</hi> their Innocence, or to <hi>Compound</hi> their <hi>Debts,</hi> if they are not able to discharge them. But whether they are our Friends or Acquaintants, or no, the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> obliges us, as we have Opportunity and Ability, to <hi>relieve</hi> their Necessities, to <hi>redress</hi> their Injuries, and if it be just and feasible, to <hi>contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute</hi> to their Enlargement, that so they may enjoy themselves with Comfort, and by their honest Industry make Provision for those who depend on them.</p>
               <p>AND then <hi>lastly,</hi> for bodily <hi>Torments</hi> and <hi>Persecutions,</hi> you need not be told what a <hi>Misery</hi> that is; for your own <hi>Sense</hi> will inform you, how dolorous it is to Flesh and Blood, to be cruelly scourged, beaten and abused; to be pinched with
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:34683:110"/>
Hunger, harrassed with Labour, and dispirited for Want of necessary Ease and Refreshment; and therefore as <hi>Mercy</hi> binds you by the strictest Obligations, not to <hi>inflict</hi> these Evils upon your <hi>Children,</hi> or <hi>Servants,</hi> or any others that are in your <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Disposal;</hi> so it also engages you to endeavour the <hi>Relief</hi> of all such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Persons, whom you know to be thus cruelly treated; to <hi>intercede</hi> in their behalf with those their hard-hearted Parents, Masters, or Conquerors, by whom they are thus unmercifully dealt with, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate to them their Cruelty and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity, and to endeavour, by such Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are most likely to affect them, to <hi>reduce</hi> them to a more <hi>merciful Temper</hi> and <hi>Treatment:</hi> and if in despight of your Arguments they still persist in their Cruelty, to use all just and lawful ways to <hi>curb</hi> and <hi>restrain</hi> them, to <hi>complain</hi> of them to those who have power to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, and to <hi>rescue</hi> the miserable Wretches out of their Power and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal.</p>
               <p>AND then as for those who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly <hi>perfecuted</hi> for their <hi>Conscience</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> who to secure their <hi>Souls,</hi> and their Loyalty to <hi>God</hi> and their <hi>Saviour,</hi> are forced to fly from their Habitations
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:34683:110"/>
and Countries, or to submit themselves to Spoil and Depredation, to Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Famine; Torture and Death; <hi>these</hi> doubtless are of all others the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Objects</hi> of our Mercy, because <hi>they</hi> suffer for our <hi>common Master</hi> and in our <hi>common Cause,</hi> which ought to be dearer to us than our own Lives; because our <hi>Religion</hi> suffers with them, and what <hi>they</hi> suffer <hi>we</hi> must suffer (unless we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce our Religion) if ever we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to their Circumstances. And can we with <hi>unconcerned</hi> Hearts behold our persecuted <hi>Brethren,</hi> flying into our Arms for Succour before the mighty <hi>Nimrods</hi> of the Earth, with their <hi>Souls;</hi> their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,</hi> and their <hi>Religion</hi> in their Hands; and with pitiful Looks beseeching us to <hi>deliver</hi> them from the <hi>dreadful Dilemma</hi> they are put to, of delivering up their <hi>Souls,</hi> or <hi>Bodies</hi> for a Prey; without A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies of <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Compassion?</hi> And if we have any <hi>Mercy</hi> or <hi>Compassion</hi> for them, by what more suitable Acts can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it, than by a <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>welcome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> of those who fly to us for Succour, and a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>liberal Contribution</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Relief and Subsistence; and by assisting those with the Charity of our <hi>Prayers;</hi> whom we cannot reach with the Charity of our <hi>Alms;</hi> or as the Apostle
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:34683:111"/>
expresses it, by <hi>remembring those that are in bonds,</hi> that is, so as to pity them and pray for them, and if it were in our Power, so as to visit and comfort and relieve them, <hi>as being bound with them,</hi> and also with the same effect to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber those that <hi>suffer Adversity as being our selves also in the body.</hi> Heb. xiii. 3.</p>
               <p>IV. ANOTHER of the Miseries which affect Mens Bodies is <hi>Civil,</hi> or <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Punishments inflicted on them for Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries received. For all considerable Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do give us a Right to <hi>punish</hi> the Of-Offender, either by due course of <hi>Law,</hi> or else immediately by our own <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> If by Nature or Compact the Offender be put under our <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Disposal,</hi> his offence giveth us a Right to <hi>correct</hi> him by our own Authority; if <hi>not,</hi> his offence giveth us Right to <hi>appeal</hi> to the Publick Tribunals, and there to exact of him such Penalties as the <hi>Law</hi> denounces in the case. Now because Mens <hi>Souls</hi> are out of the reach of all Humane Punishments, and liable only to the lash of the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Spirits;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can exact no other Penalties of Offenders, but only such as do affect their <hi>Bodies</hi> with Shame, or Pain, with loss of bodily <hi>Goods,</hi> or wearisome <hi>Labour,</hi> or confinement of <hi>Liberty;</hi> all which being
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:34683:111"/>
Miseries to the <hi>Body,</hi> are proper Objects of our <hi>Compassion</hi> and <hi>Mercy.</hi> And what <hi>Mercy</hi> these Miseries require, may be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily collected from the natural <hi>End</hi> of <hi>Punishment,</hi> which is not so much to <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> the Guilty, as to <hi>defend</hi> the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, not so much to <hi>hurt</hi> or <hi>damnifie</hi> the Offender, as to <hi>restrain</hi> him from hurting himself, or others; and to <hi>warn</hi> others, by the Example of his <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> not to imitate the Example of his <hi>Offence.</hi> So that according to its true and natural <hi>Design,</hi> Punishment is rather an act of <hi>Mercy,</hi> than an act of <hi>Revenge;</hi> the <hi>End</hi> of it being to do <hi>good,</hi> and not to retaliate <hi>evil;</hi> to defend my <hi>self,</hi> or <hi>others</hi> against the Offenders, or else to defend the <hi>Offenders</hi> against themselves, or to defend others against the prevailing Infection of their lewd and pernicious <hi>Examples:</hi> and whosoever punishes to vent and ease his <hi>Spleen,</hi> or gratifie his <hi>Malice</hi> with the Hurt and Mischief of the Offender; transgresses the <hi>End</hi> of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and under pretence of <hi>Iustice</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to his own <hi>Cruelty.</hi> No Man hath Right to do another <hi>Hurt,</hi> unless it be necessary to some good <hi>End;</hi> for to hurt without <hi>any</hi> Reason is a brutish <hi>Savageness,</hi> and to hurt without a <hi>good</hi> Reason devilish
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:34683:112"/>
                  <hi>Rancour:</hi> he therefore who hurts another <hi>merely</hi> to hurt him, acts with the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Devil,</hi> who doth mischief for mischiefs sake and plagues his wretched Vassals merely to recreate himself with their Miseries, and pacifie his own black Rage and Malice. Since therefore the <hi>End</hi> of punishment is doing <hi>good,</hi> it ought to be executed with a good <hi>Will,</hi> and a kind and benevolent <hi>Intention;</hi> not to discharge our <hi>Rage,</hi> or tickle and recreate our <hi>Malice,</hi> but either to <hi>vindicate</hi> our own Right, or to <hi>reclaim</hi> the Offender, or to <hi>terrifie</hi> others from his sin by his <hi>Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> This therefore is the <hi>first</hi> thing which the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> requires of us, in respect to our punishing Offenders, that we should always do it with a good and benevolent <hi>Intention.</hi> But then,</p>
               <p>II. IT also requires us not to exact Punishment for <hi>small</hi> and <hi>trifling</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences: for since the <hi>End</hi> of Punishment is doing <hi>good,</hi> it is Cruelty to exact it for <hi>slight</hi> and <hi>inconsiderable</hi> Evils; because in this case the <hi>Punishment</hi> is a greater Hurt than the <hi>Offence.</hi> And what Reason can I have to hurt another for such <hi>small</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, as do little or no hurt either to my self or others, but only to gratifie my own <hi>Revenge</hi> and <hi>Malice?</hi> As for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34683:112"/>
suppose that in a heat of Passion a Man should give me the <hi>Lye,</hi> or call me by an <hi>ill Name,</hi> or treat me with <hi>reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Language;</hi> and thereupon I should strike, or wound him, or prosecute him with with a vexatious Suit at Law: in this case it is plain my <hi>Punishment</hi> would hurt him more than his <hi>Offence</hi> could hurt me, and consequently my <hi>Design</hi> in punishing him would be to do <hi>Hurt</hi> and not <hi>Good;</hi> and to design to do Hurt is <hi>Malice</hi> and <hi>Cruelty.</hi> Wherefore in case of <hi>lighter</hi> Injuries, the Law of Mercy requires us wholy to <hi>remit</hi> and <hi>forgive</hi> them; and not rigidly to exact the Hurt of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender for such trifling Offences, as do no <hi>great Hurt</hi> either to our selves, or others.</p>
               <p>III. THE <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> also obliges us <hi>not</hi> to punish an Offender, when we can do <hi>no Good</hi> by it either to our <hi>selves,</hi> or to <hi>him,</hi> or to <hi>others;</hi> for in this Case to punish can serve no other End, but to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the Lust of our <hi>Revenge</hi> and <hi>Malice.</hi> As for instance, suppose I have a poor <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvent Debtor,</hi> that owes me a great deal and can pay me nothing; and it were in my power not only to cast him into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but to force him to languish away his wretched Life; to what <hi>end</hi> should I inflict this Punishment upon him? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:34683:113"/>
hope to <hi>recover my own</hi> by it, for a <hi>Prison,</hi> we say, <hi>will pay no Debts;</hi> and where nothing is, nothing can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: I cannot design to <hi>reform him</hi> by it, since Prisons are commonly the most fruitful Nurseries of Wickedness: I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aim to <hi>warn others</hi> by it, for what Warning can oblige Men to do that which is impossible? What <hi>End</hi> can I propose then, but only the humouring of a wrathful Mind, and to glut it with <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> and <hi>Mischief?</hi> and if this be the Point I drive at, I run from all the Rules of <hi>Mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. THE <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> also obliges me <hi>not</hi> to punish an Offender, so long as the <hi>End</hi> of punishing him is fairly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by <hi>gentler Means.</hi> For if when I can obtain my End of an Offender by <hi>Persuasion</hi> and <hi>Forbearance,</hi> I rather chuse to extort it from him by <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> it is plain that I have a <hi>cruel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> towards him, and do affect to hurt and mischief him: for when I may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my End of him by <hi>Forbearance</hi> or <hi>gentle Persuasions,</hi> why should I chuse to force it from him by <hi>Rigour</hi> and <hi>Severity;</hi> but that I am either insensible of his hurt, or else do take pleasure to afflict and grieve him? Wherefore in all such Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:34683:113"/>
as are within our Power, the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> obligeth us, first to try <hi>softer</hi> and <hi>gentler</hi> ways, and make a long and through Experiment of the methods of <hi>Kindness, Persuasion</hi> and <hi>Forbearance;</hi> and if by these we can obtain our End, and conquer the Offender and vindicate our own Right, to <hi>remit</hi> our Right of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and <hi>forbear</hi> all Rigour and Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. For Punishment is our <hi>last</hi> Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ought never to be applied to Offenders, till gentler means have been tried, and defeated.</p>
               <p>V. THE <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> also obliges us to inflict <hi>no more</hi> Punishment on Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, than what is absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> to the obtaining those good <hi>Ends</hi> we design by it. For he who punishes an Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more than is <hi>needful</hi> to the natural End of punishment, can design no other End by it but what is <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>barbarous:</hi> and whatsoever is more than <hi>needful</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>vindicating</hi> our own Right, or the <hi>reforming</hi> the Offender, or the giving fair <hi>warning</hi> to others, serves to no other purpose but to gratifie our own <hi>Revenge</hi> and <hi>Fury.</hi> So far as Punishment is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to these good <hi>Ends,</hi> it is not only <hi>lawful,</hi> but <hi>good:</hi> but all <hi>beyond</hi> what is needful to these, is perfect <hi>Savageness</hi> and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:34683:114"/>
                  <hi>Cruelty.</hi> When therefore for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Ends, we are necessitated to punish an Offender, the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> obliges us first to try <hi>lighter</hi> and <hi>gentler</hi> Punishments; and if by these we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtain our End, to proceed in our Severities by <hi>degrees,</hi> and not to fly to extreme Rigour, till we have found all <hi>gentler</hi> Corrections <hi>ineffectual.</hi> For if a <hi>lighter</hi> Punishment will do the work, it is Cruelty to lay on a <hi>heavier:</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will or no, is no otherwise to be known than by <hi>Tryal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly and Lastly, THE <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> also requires us, always to punish <hi>short</hi> of the Offence, i. e. where the Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in your <hi>power,</hi> and you are not determined by a <hi>legal Necessity</hi> to use the utmost Extremity. For where you are <hi>legally</hi> obliged either to judge, or prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute an Offender, there you are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by the measures of the <hi>Law</hi> which obliges you, and which usually deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines you to the <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of the Punishment to be inflicted: but where the matter is wholly in your <hi>power,</hi> either to remit of, or augment the punishment, there the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> obliges you not to exact the <hi>utmost.</hi> For if you punish <hi>more</hi> than the Offence deserves, you are
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:34683:114"/>
                  <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>tyrannical;</hi> because as your Right to punish accrues from the Offence that is done to you, so your Right to punish to such a degree accrues from the degree of the Offence; which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>exceed</hi> without exceeding your <hi>Right,</hi> and exacting <hi>more</hi> Punishment of the Offender than he <hi>owes</hi> you. So that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree of punishment which <hi>exceeds</hi> the demerit of the fault, is <hi>lawless</hi> and <hi>licentious</hi> Violence, to which we can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no Right, and by which we do an injurious <hi>Outrage</hi> to the Offender. And as when our Punishment <hi>exceeds</hi> the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, we punish without <hi>Iustice;</hi> so when it <hi>equals</hi> the Offence, we punish with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Mercy.</hi> For the <hi>utmost</hi> degree of just Severity admits no Intermixture of <hi>Mercy;</hi> the Office of which is to relieve the miserable, and consequently to relieve them, when they have injured and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us, of some part of the Evils and Miseries they deserve. Wherefore as he is an unmerciful <hi>Creditor,</hi> who rather than abate the least part of his Due, will strip his poor Debtor to the Skin, and reduce him to the utmost Pinch and Extremity of Need; so he is an unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Punisher,</hi> that exacts to the full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit of the Fault, and stretches his Right
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:34683:115"/>
of punishing to the utmost extent, to make the Offender miserable. In this case therefore the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> requires us to follow the great Example of <hi>God,</hi> who in the midst of <hi>Iustice</hi> doth always remember <hi>Mercy;</hi> who makes <hi>large Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of his Right to punish us, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exacts of us the utmost Plagues and Sufferings which our Iniquities <hi>deserve.</hi> Conformably to which excellent Pattern, we are obliged in punishing others to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingle <hi>Mercy</hi> with our <hi>Severities;</hi> and proportionably to the Offender's Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or the pitiable Circumstances of his Fault, or the Misery and Necessities of his present Condition, to make an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Abatement,</hi> and <hi>Defalcation</hi> of his Punishment. And thus you see what that Mercy is which is required of us with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to our <hi>punishing</hi> of others.</p>
               <p>Fifthly and Lastly, ANOTHER of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series which affect Mens <hi>Bodies</hi> is want of the outward <hi>Necessaries</hi> of this present Life, such as <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink, Lodging</hi> and <hi>Apparel;</hi> the want of which cannot but render our Life exceeding wretched and miserable. For what an insupportable Grievance is it to our Nature, to be pinched with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient Hunger, or suffocated with a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Drought; to be forced to prey upon
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:34683:115"/>
it self for want of other Fewel, or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease its furious Appetites with loathsom, heartless or unwholesome Sustenance; to see a hungry Family crying about us for want of Bread, and have little or none to give them; to behold our Children shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering with Cold, and drooping with Famine, and not be able to succour and relieve them; whilst our pined and miserable Carkasses are either covered with loathsom Rags, or nakedly exposed to the Injuries of the Weather, and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute and unprovided than the Foxes and Birds, for want of a Hole, or Nest where to lay their Heads? These are Circumstances <hi>miserable</hi> enough to move a Heart of Stone to <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Compassion:</hi> In this case therefore we are obliged by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy,</hi> first, to a tender <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy</hi> and <hi>Commiseration;</hi> to affect our Souls with a soft and compassionate sense of the Wants of our poor Brethren, to put our <hi>selves</hi> in <hi>their</hi> Case, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>their</hi> Condition to <hi>our own</hi> Hearts and Affections, as if it were <hi>our own;</hi> and thereby to endeavour and excite in our selves a proportionable <hi>Feeling</hi> of their Calamity and Misery. And to this we are universally obliged, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are high or low, rich or poor,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:34683:116"/>
whether we are in Circumstances to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Needs of others, or to need Relief for our selves: for so the Precept runneth universally, <hi>Finally be all of one mind, having compassion one of another; love as Brethren, be pitiful, be courteous,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 8. And as we are universally obliged to <hi>compassionate</hi> those that are in Need, so we are also bound, according as we have opportunity and ability, to <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi> and <hi>relieve</hi> them. Indeed if we are poor and needy, we are by no means obliged to pinch our <hi>selves,</hi> or our <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> to relieve the Necessities of <hi>others;</hi> for the desire of <hi>Self-Preservation</hi> being of all others the most vehement Passion, which God hath implanted in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; he doth thereby not only <hi>warrant,</hi> but <hi>direct</hi> us to take care of our <hi>selves</hi> in the first place, and not to sacrifice the means of our <hi>own</hi> Preservation to the Needs and Necessities of <hi>others.</hi> And then our nearest <hi>Relatives</hi> being next to our <hi>selves,</hi> we are obliged in the next place to relieve <hi>them;</hi> and consequently in all <hi>Competitions</hi> for our Relief and Mercy, to prefer the Wants and Necessities of <hi>our own</hi> Families. But though <hi>we</hi> may not be <hi>able,</hi> without wronging our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to give Alms to our necessitous Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:34683:116"/>
yet if by representing his Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to <hi>others</hi> who are better able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, if by <hi>solliciting</hi> his Cause and <hi>begging</hi> Relief for him, which he perhaps is ashamed to do for himself, we can any way contribute to his <hi>Succour</hi> and <hi>Support,</hi> we stand strictly obliged to it by the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Mercy:</hi> and this, if we can do no more, will be as acceptable to God, as the most liberal Alms. For where the <hi>Deed</hi> is impossible, God always accepts the <hi>Will</hi> for it, and reckoneth <hi>in</hi> all those good Works to our account, which he knows we would do, if we were able. But when he hath furnished us with <hi>Means,</hi> as well as <hi>Opportunities,</hi> to relieve the Necessitous, he expects the <hi>Deed,</hi> as well as the <hi>Will</hi> from us; knowing that we cannot <hi>sincerely</hi> will the Deed, if when it is in our power we do not <hi>effect</hi> it: Hence is that of the <hi>Heb.</hi> xiii. 16. <hi>To do good and to communicate, forget not, for with such sacrifice God is well pleased.</hi> And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Apostle biddeth <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. vi. 17, 18. <hi>To charge them that are rich,</hi> i. e. whose enjoyments do exceed their necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <hi>that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate.</hi> And how necessary the Deed is to the <hi>Sincerity</hi> of the Will, when it is
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:34683:117"/>
in our power, that passage of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth fully Evidence, 1 Epist. <hi>chap.</hi> iii. <hi>v.</hi> 17. <hi>But whoso hath this worlds good and seeth his Brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him.</hi> This therefore is an Act of <hi>Mercy</hi> indispensably due from us to those who are in Necessity, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute according to our ability towards their Relief and Support; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Alms,</hi> which signifies a gift to one that is in need, cometh from the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>WE have seen that <hi>Almsgiving</hi> is one of the principal Acts of <hi>Mercy;</hi> and it being so, I shall more largely insist upon it, and endeavour to shew,</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:34683:117"/>
                  <item>First, THE Manner in which it ought to be preformed: And</item>
                  <item>Secondly, To <hi>press</hi> the Performance of it by some <hi>Considerations.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>I. THE Manner in which this Duty of <hi>Almsgiving</hi> ought to be performed, and that in these following particulars:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, IT ought to be performed with a good and merciful Intention.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, JUSTLY and Righteously.</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, READILY and Chearfully.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, LIBERALLY and Bountifully.</item>
                  <item>Fifthly, TIMELY and Seasonably.</item>
                  <item>Sixthly, DISCREETLY and Prudently.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I. THIS Duty of <hi>Almsgiving</hi> ought to be performed with a <hi>good</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> Intention, not meerly to court the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauses and Commendations of Men, to bring our Names in vogue, or to serve our secular Designs; but chiefly and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to express our <hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> to God, and <hi>Confidence</hi> in Him; who hath not only filled our Cup, but crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it with an overflowing Plenty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inabling us to relieve others, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by constituting us <hi>Trustees</hi> for the Poor and Needy, with a strict and inviolable Charge to give them their Food in due season; to which he hath annexed a <hi>Bill</hi> of <hi>Credit</hi> under his own <hi>Broad Seal,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:34683:118"/>
us the <hi>Principal</hi> of our Alms with a thousand-fold <hi>Interest:</hi> With respect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to these mighty <hi>Reasons,</hi> and out of a tender <hi>Commiseration</hi> to our poor Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we ought to perform our Alms; that so like Curls of <hi>holy Incense</hi> they may ascend to Heaven, and breath a <hi>sweet smelling</hi> Savour into the Nostrils of God. For 'tis by <hi>this</hi> alone that they are consecrated into an <hi>acceptable Sacrifice</hi> to him, and render'd <hi>true Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion:</hi> whereas if we give our Alms meerly, or mainly to be <hi>seen of Men,</hi> or to serve a worldly Interest, they proceed not from <hi>Mercy</hi> but <hi>Self-Love.</hi> And since all Acts that are <hi>materially</hi> good do receive their <hi>Form,</hi> and <hi>Denomination</hi> from the <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> such Pharisaical Alms can be deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated neither <hi>Pieties,</hi> nor <hi>Mercies,</hi> but are a sordid Traffick for <hi>Applause</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest;</hi> and hence our Saviour cautions us, <hi>Take heed that ye do not your Alms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, to be seen of them; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in Heaven: therefore when thou dost thine Alms, do not sound a Trumpet before thee, as the Hypocrites do in the Synagogues, and in the Streets, that they may have glory of men; verily I say unto you, they have their reward.</hi> Matth. vi. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:34683:118"/>II. This Duty of Almsgiving ought to be performed with <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> that is, we ought not to give that in Alms which is none of <hi>our own,</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it hath a rightful Owner, to whom we can make a Restitution of it For what we have <hi>wrongfully</hi> got, is none of <hi>ours,</hi> but <hi>his</hi> whom we have <hi>wrongfully deprived</hi> of it; and to him we are bound in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to restore it, in case he be living, and we know where to find him; if not, to his lawful Heirs, or Assigns: But if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Party be dead whom we have wrong'd of it, or we cannot find him, or any Heir of his, that can lawfully claim it; it is not only <hi>lawful,</hi> but <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> for us to bestow it upon the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Needy.</hi> For where there is no visible Owner, the Property reverts immediately into the Hands of the <hi>Supream Lord</hi> of the World; who hath settled it as a Pension on the <hi>Poor,</hi> to eek out the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Provisions which his Providence hath made for them. But to give Alms out of those <hi>unlawful Gains,</hi> which we are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged in Justice to restore to the rightful Owners, is to make our selves the <hi>Thieves,</hi> and the Poor the <hi>Receivers.</hi> For to do Alms, is to give away something of <hi>our own</hi> to remedy another's Want or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery; and therefore to give away one
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:34683:119"/>
Man's Right, to supply another's Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is not so much an <hi>Alms,</hi> as a <hi>Robbery.</hi> By this Rule therefore Debtors that owe more than they can pay, are obliged in Conscience not to intrench upon their <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> by their <hi>Mercy;</hi> nor to disable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from being <hi>just</hi> to their Creditors, by being <hi>merciful</hi> to the Poor. For though to relieve the Poor be <hi>nakedly,</hi> and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractedly</hi> good; yet it is to be considered, that particular Actions are good, or bad, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the <hi>Circumstances</hi> are which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to them: And when that Action which is <hi>nakedly good,</hi> happens to be clothed with an <hi>evil Circumstance,</hi> it is <hi>so far</hi> Evil and Unlawful. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when my <hi>relieving</hi> the Poor is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with this <hi>evil Circumstance</hi> of <hi>defrauding</hi> my Creditors of their Due, I am so far bound in Conscience not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; because if I do, I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them <hi>unjustly:</hi> this therefore we are especially to take care of, that our Alms be <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. THIS Duty of Almsgiving ought to be performed <hi>readily</hi> and <hi>chearfully.</hi> For this is the Apostle's own Direction, <hi>Even man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity; for God loveth a Chearful Giver</hi>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:34683:119"/>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 7. And indeed if we give Alms out of a Principle of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> it is impossible but we must do it <hi>chearfully;</hi> because by Compassion we make <hi>others</hi> Miseries our <hi>own,</hi> and so by relieving them we relieve our selves, and are <hi>Partakers</hi> with them in the Comfort of those Reliefs we afford them. For when I see a Man struggling with Want, and groaning under a sharp Necessity, if I relieve him, I <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>refresh</hi> my own yearning Bowels; and the Humane Nature within me, which is common to us both, doth by a kind of <hi>sympathetick Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> exalt and raise up it self, and swells with a <hi>generous</hi> Pleasure. So that if <hi>Mercy</hi> be the Spring of my Alms, they will flow with a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>chearful</hi> Current, because all the while I am watering <hi>others,</hi> I shall feel the <hi>Refreshment</hi> of my own Streams. When therefore we bestow our Alms with a <hi>grudging</hi> and <hi>unwilling</hi> Mind, 'tis plain that it is not Mercy, but <hi>Shame,</hi> or <hi>Fear,</hi> or <hi>Importunity</hi> that moves us; and if so, there is no <hi>Virtue</hi> in them, nor can we expect that any <hi>Reward</hi> should attend them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For to contribute towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Relief, because we are <hi>ashamed,</hi> or <hi>afraid</hi> to do otherwise, is rather paying a <hi>Tax,</hi> than giving an <hi>Alms:</hi> And when
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:34683:120"/>
nothing can be wrung out of me, but what is distrained by <hi>Importunity,</hi> I give not for the <hi>Poor</hi>'s Relief, but for <hi>my own</hi> Peace and Quiet: And what <hi>Virtue</hi> is it for a Man to give, only to get rid of a <hi>Dun,</hi> and ease himself of a troublesome <hi>Importunity?</hi> Wherefore to render our Alms <hi>virtuous,</hi> and <hi>rewardable;</hi> it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that they should be performed with a <hi>free</hi> and <hi>chearful</hi> Heart; that they should flow, like Water from a Spring, in <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> and <hi>unforced</hi> Streams, and not be pump'd from us with Shame, or Impot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>
               <p>IV. THIS Duty of <hi>Almsgiving</hi> ought to be performed <hi>liberally,</hi> and <hi>bountifully;</hi> according to the proportion of our Estate and Abilities. For the <hi>Design</hi> of those <hi>Alms</hi> which are the Fruits of Mercy, is to <hi>redress</hi> the poor Man's Misery, to <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy</hi> his hungry Bowels, and <hi>rescue</hi> him from the pinching Necessities under which he groans and languishes: And this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Design</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> it measures its Alms accordingly, and <hi>proportions</hi> them to the craving Necessities it supplieth. And its Aim being not only to rescue the miserable from <hi>extream</hi> Misery, but also according to its Power, to render them <hi>happy;</hi> it doth not think it sufficient to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:34683:120"/>
rescue the Necessitous from <hi>extream</hi> Want and Famine, but doth also covet to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Lives <hi>happy,</hi> and give them a <hi>comfortable</hi> Enjoyment of themselves. For meerly to keep a Man from <hi>famishing,</hi> looks rather like a design to <hi>prolong</hi> his Torment, and <hi>spin out</hi> the Duration of his Misery, than to contribute to his <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Happiness;</hi> and if we design His <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,</hi> as we must do if we design <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully,</hi> we shall endeavour not only to enable him to <hi>live,</hi> but to live <hi>comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,</hi> and accordingly <hi>proportion</hi> our Alms. 'Tis true, the <hi>Liberality</hi> of our Alms is to be measured, not according to the <hi>Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity</hi> of them, but according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion they bear to our <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> and though I should give five times less than one who hath ten times my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, yet I should be as liberal as <hi>he,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>proportion</hi> of my Ability: And accordingly the indigent Widow's <hi>two mites</hi> are pronounced by our <hi>Saviour</hi> a more liberal Alms, than the much more which those which were Rich cast into the Treasury, <hi>Mar.</hi> xii 42, 43, 44. <hi>Because they cast in of their abundance, but she of her want.</hi> And therefore though (as I shall shew by and by) it is impossible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin

the <hi>Measures</hi> of Alms, which we are obliged to, because the particular Measure of our <hi>Abilities</hi> is so various; yet this to be sure the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acteth, that in proportion to our Estates and Circumstances, they should be <hi>liberal</hi> and <hi>bountiful.</hi> For he who gives in such slender Proportions as bring little or no Relief to the Receiver, acts as if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed rather to <hi>mock</hi> him, than to <hi>supply</hi> his Necessities; or as if he intended ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to keep him alive for a Prey to a <hi>long</hi> and <hi>lingering</hi> Misery, than to render his Life <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>comfortable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. THIS Duty of <hi>Almsgiving</hi> ought to be performed <hi>timely</hi> and <hi>seasonably,</hi> i. e. in the nick of <hi>Opportunity,</hi> when the poor Man's Necessities call loudest for it, and our Relief and Succour may be most <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial</hi> to him. To such Poor indeed as do always want, our Alms can never be <hi>unseasonable,</hi> because their Necessities do always call for them: But there are some particular <hi>Seasons</hi> when their Wants call <hi>louder,</hi> as in times of Sickness; or Scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Work; or Dearness of Provisions; or in the beginning of Arrests, before the Prison hath devoured them; or after a great Loss, when their Fortunes are sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:34683:121"/>
and a small Support may keep their Heads above water; or, in a word, when they are young and capable of Work, or Instruction, and their Parents are not able to dispose of them, when the placing them out to some honest Calling may prevent their turning Thieves or Beggars, and render them useful to the World; or when they are setting up their Trades with an insufficient Stock, and a little Help may encourage their Diligence, and advance them to a comfortable Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. <hi>These</hi> and <hi>such</hi> like are the <hi>proper Seasons</hi> of Almsgiving; in which by ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering our helping hand, we may rescue many a poor Wretch out of a deep Abyss of <hi>Misery,</hi> and render their future Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>prosperous.</hi> Wherefore the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> obliges us, not only to bestow our Alms, but to bestow them at such <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Seasons</hi> wherein they are most needed, and may do the <hi>greatest Good;</hi> that we should not reserve them to our last Will and Testament, like Med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars that are never good till they are rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; but embrace all Opportunities, while we are living, to give <hi>timely Reliefs</hi> to the Necessitous. For he who <hi>deferreth</hi> his Alms, when such <hi>proper Seasons</hi> are presented, is <hi>so far</hi> the Cause of all the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:34683:122"/>
consequent Calamities which the Poor do suffer by the want of them: And since the <hi>Design</hi> of Mens Alms is to <hi>relieve</hi> the Sufferings of the Poor, 'tis doubtless a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Cruelty to <hi>prolong</hi> their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by needlesly <hi>delaying</hi> to relieve them. You would think her a <hi>cruel</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that having Bread enough and to spare, should rather choose to afflict her Child with a long unsatisfied Hunger, than to content its craving Appetite by giving it its Food in due <hi>Season:</hi> And sure 'tis a great Defect of <hi>Compassion</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarily to <hi>prolong</hi> the Sufferings of our indigent Brother, though it be but for a Day or an Hour, when we have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Opportunity</hi> to relieve him: And since whatsoever Relief we do design him, he must necessarily <hi>lose</hi> so much of it as the Time of our <hi>Delay</hi> amounts to, Mercy obliges us to relieve him <hi>quickly,</hi> and not to suffer him to <hi>pine</hi> away, whilst our Charity is growing.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and Lastly, THIS Duty of <hi>Almsgiving</hi> ought to be performed <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly,</hi> and <hi>prudently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> For thus the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist tells us, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxii. 5. <hi>A good man sheweth favour and lendeth, and will guide his affairs with discretion.</hi> And indeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>Prudence</hi> be the Dispenser of our
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:34683:122"/>
Alms, <hi>Mercy</hi> will miss of what it aims at and designs by them; which is to do good to the Poor, to supply their craving Necessities and give them a comfortable enjoyment of themselves: Instead of which, if we do not manage our Charities with <hi>Prudence,</hi> we shall many times <hi>create</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities by <hi>supplying</hi> them, and <hi>increase</hi> and <hi>multiply</hi> the miseries of the World by an <hi>unskilful</hi> Endeavour to <hi>redress</hi> them. For it is with Alms, as it is with Estates, where half of the Riches doth consist in the <hi>Discretion</hi> of the Owner; and those very Charities, which being distributed by a <hi>blind</hi> Superstition, or a <hi>foolish</hi> Pity, do many times do more <hi>Hurt</hi> than <hi>Good;</hi> might have been improved into a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Provision for the Necessities of the World, had they been <hi>wisely</hi> ordered and disposed. But what Harvest can the World reap from this precious Seed of our Alms, when they are sown with a <hi>careless,</hi> or <hi>unskilful</hi> hand? When they are either thrown on a heap to <hi>useless</hi> or <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious</hi> purposes, or scattered at all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, without any distinction of the cultivated from the fallow Ground; so that the Birds of Prey, the useless <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants, Drones</hi> and <hi>Beggars</hi> devour and eat them up, whilst the <hi>modest, impotent,</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:34683:123"/>
and <hi>laborious</hi> Poor are utterly destitute and unprovided? Since therefore the Design of Mercy is to do <hi>Good</hi> with its Alms, to comfort and relieve the Poor, and supply their pinching Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; it is doubtless very necessary in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to this end, that it should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Discretion;</hi> which ought more particularly to guide and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our Alms; First, In the Method of <hi>Provision</hi> of them. Secondly, In the Choice of the <hi>Objects</hi> of them. Thirdly, in the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi> of them. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, As to the <hi>Proportions</hi> of them. Fifthly, In the <hi>Manner</hi> of bestowing them.</p>
               <p>I. WE ought to exercise our <hi>Prudence</hi> as to the Method of <hi>providing</hi> our Alms. For herein <hi>Prudence</hi> will direct us, not only to be <hi>frugal</hi> in our Expences, to pare off our Superfluities, and to be <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent</hi> and <hi>industrious</hi> in our Callings, that we may have to give to them that need; but also out of our Incomes and Profits to <hi>consecrate</hi> a considerable Proportion to <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>charitable</hi> Uses. And herein the Apostle giveth us an excellent Rule, 1 Cor. xvi. 2. <hi>Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as God hath prospered him, that there</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:34683:123"/>
                  <hi>be no gatherings when I come:</hi> which though it doth not carry with it a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> and <hi>indispensable</hi> Obligation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impossible for many Men to take a Weekly Account how God hath prosper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and to lay by accordingly; yet thus far at least it is a very <hi>wise Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to us, that as oft as we cast up our Accounts, whether it be <hi>weekly, monthly,</hi> or <hi>annually,</hi> we should in <hi>Proportion</hi> to our Increase devote some convenient Share of it, as a private Bank or Treasury for <hi>charitable</hi> Uses; that so we may not be to seek for Alms upon <hi>sudden</hi> and <hi>emergent</hi> Occasions, but may have a Store <hi>ready</hi> by us, to supply our daily Expence and Distribution. And if we take care not to alienate, or imbezle what we have thus devoted to our private <hi>Corban,</hi> we shall always give with chearfulness, having by us a <hi>Stock</hi> designed to no other End but that of <hi>Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. WE ought also to exercise our <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> in the Choice of the <hi>Objects</hi> of our Charity, so as to take care that they be such as do <hi>truly</hi> need and deserve it. For unless we do so, we shall many times encourage <hi>Vice,</hi> instead of relieving <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty;</hi> and be tempted by the <hi>clamorous</hi> Importunities of idle and vicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:34683:124"/>
to <hi>prostitute</hi> our Alms to their Sloth and Intemperance. For how often do we see the <hi>imprudent Charities</hi> of well disposed Minds poured into those Sinks of Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and like the Sacrifices of <hi>Bel,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the importunate Lusts of a company of idle <hi>Drones</hi> and <hi>Beggers;</hi> that are not so properly the Members, as the Wens of the Body Politick, as being utterly <hi>useless</hi> to all its Natural Ends, and only serving to deform and bring Diseases upon it, and to draw away the Nourishment of it from its useful Parts and Members? Now what a Shame and Pity is it, that these precious Fruits of <hi>Mercy</hi> should be thus abused and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed, to pamper a company of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring <hi>Vermin,</hi> whose business it is to croak about the Streets, and wander from Door to Door; whilst many a <hi>poor indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious</hi> Family, that hath more Mouths to feed than Hands to Work, lies droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under its Wants, and Necessities? Wherefore though the former are not to be altogether <hi>neglected,</hi> when their Needs are real and urgent; yet certainly <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> will direct our Charity to such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as have either <hi>fallen</hi> from Riches to Poverty, and consequently are less able to Toil and Drudge for Bread; or
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:34683:124"/>
else to such as are either <hi>worn out</hi> by La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or <hi>disabled</hi> from it by Sickness, or <hi>oppressed</hi> with such a numerous Charge of Children, as do exceed their utmost Industry to maintain. In such <hi>good Grounds</hi> as these <hi>Prudence</hi> will advise us to sow the main of our Charities, and not to throw it away with a careless Hand upon the <hi>barren Rocks</hi> and <hi>High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,</hi> to be devoured by Vermin, and Birds and Prey.</p>
               <p>III. WE ought to exercise our <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> in determining the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of our Alms. And herein <hi>Prudence</hi> will direct us, to prefer those Alms which may serve a poor Man for a <hi>constant</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision and put him in a <hi>fixed</hi> way of living, before those which are <hi>transient,</hi> and do only help in a <hi>Pang</hi> of Need; which do just hold him up from perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for an Hour, but do not take him out of the <hi>deep Waters.</hi> Wherefore if the Person, to whom we design a Relief, be fit and able to <hi>work,</hi> or hath been bred up in any honest <hi>Occupation,</hi> 'tis a much <hi>wiser</hi> Charity, to provide him an <hi>Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or to contribute towards the Setting him up in his <hi>Trade,</hi> than barely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his <hi>present</hi> Necessity; because by this means we relieve him both for the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:34683:125"/>
                  <hi>present</hi> and the <hi>future,</hi> and convert our Alms into a <hi>standing</hi> Maintenance. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which Account 'tis doubtless a very <hi>prudent</hi> Charity to contribute to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Maintenance of Publick <hi>Work-houses</hi> for the Poor, where they and their Children may be provided with such Work as they are capable of; and thereby be inured to <hi>Industry,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to support <hi>themselves.</hi> And as <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> Charity prefers such Alms as do draw after them a <hi>lasting</hi> Effect and Benefit, before such as do only supply a <hi>transient</hi> Necessity; so it also chuses, if it be consistent with Convenience, to gives its Alms in <hi>Kind</hi> rather than in <hi>Value,</hi> to give Cloaths to the Naked, and Food to the Hungry, Physick to the Sick, and Books to the Uninstructed: for though Mony indeed will answer all these Needs, yet we are not sure it will be always laid out upon them.</p>
               <p>IV. WE ought to exercise our <hi>Prudence</hi> also in sttating the <hi>Proportions</hi> of our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; that is, what Proportion of our Income, or Increase we ought to <hi>devote</hi> to Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Uses, and in what Proportion we ought to <hi>distribute.</hi> For as for the first of these, when all is done, every Man must be his own <hi>Casuist:</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> indeed
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:34683:125"/>
had a Proportion fixed and stated to their Hands; for there was a double Tithing prescribed to them by the Law of <hi>Moses, viz.</hi> the every years Tithing, which was an annual tenth part of their Increase, for the Maintenance of their <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Sacred Officers;</hi> and then there was a third years Tithing, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to the thirtieth part of their Increase, and that was devoted for the Supply and Maintenance of the <hi>Poor:</hi> and if such a Proportion were required of the <hi>Iews,</hi> we may besure a greater is required of <hi>us,</hi> whose Righteousness must <hi>exceed</hi> the Righteousness of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> if ever we mean to enter into the Kingdom of God. But since <hi>God</hi> hath not determined the exact Proportions of our Charity, it is impossible for <hi>us</hi> to do it, where there are such <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> Circumstances and Abilities in this matter: therefore we must have Men, who best understand their own Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the Guidance of their own <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> and <hi>Discretion;</hi> who are in the first place to consider, what is requisite to support them in the condition of their Birth, their Place, or Office, or Family, and to the Discharge of their several Obligations. For <hi>Prudence</hi> doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:34683:126"/>
of all the same Proportions of Charity; some may afford a twentieth, others a thirtieth, and to others whose Children and Dependents are numerous, or whose Fortunes are clogged and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, the hundreth part may be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measure. Wherefore according as the Heap is, the <hi>wise</hi> Man is to sow and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute; substracting not only what will support his <hi>Life,</hi> but also what will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Decency</hi> of his Estate and Person; and that not only as to <hi>present</hi> Needs, but also as to <hi>future</hi> Necessities, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>probable</hi> Contingencies. But yet in the stating of this matter, it is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less much safer to <hi>exceed,</hi> than to fall <hi>short</hi> of our due Proportions; for as for <hi>exceeding,</hi> we have many holy Persons for our <hi>Precedents,</hi> we have <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for our Voucher in the forenamed Case of the <hi>poor Widow,</hi> and a vast Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in <hi>Heaven</hi> for our Reward. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the determination of this Case, <hi>Christian Prudence</hi> will direct us not to be too nice and curious, too fond and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to <hi>our selves,</hi> in stretching our Needs and Conveniences beyond their <hi>just</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions; but to take easie and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Measures of them, and to spare what may be <hi>decently spared</hi> from super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:34683:126"/>
Servants, idle Meetings, unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary Feasts, and chargeable Garments and Diversions; and if we thus pare off our <hi>needless</hi> Expence, and lay aside the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plusage</hi> for Charity, the Consequence will be this; the <hi>Poor</hi> will be more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>relieved,</hi> and our <hi>selves</hi> will be more <hi>able</hi> to do it, and we shall reap more Pleasure and Profit from laying out upon the Backs and Bellies of the <hi>Poor,</hi> than from wasting it on our <hi>own</hi> Vanity And now having fixed the Proportion of your Estates for Charity, you ought in the next place to advise with your <hi>Prudence</hi> in what Proportions to <hi>distribute</hi> it: and here <hi>Prudence</hi> will direct you to differ in your <hi>Distributions,</hi> according to the different <hi>Circumstances</hi> of those whom you design to relieve by them. To such as are of a <hi>lower</hi> Rank, <hi>Prudence</hi> directs to give by <hi>little</hi> and <hi>little,</hi> according to their emergent <hi>Necessities;</hi> yet so as not always to limit your Alms to their bare <hi>Necessities,</hi> but sometimes to extend them even to their <hi>Refreshment</hi> and <hi>Recreation;</hi> that so together with their <hi>Toil</hi> and <hi>Drudgery,</hi> they may now and then enjoy some Sabbath for the <hi>Ease</hi> of Humane Nature: but to such whose Fortunes are by <hi>Loss</hi> and <hi>Accident</hi> sunk and declined,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:34683:127"/>
both Decency and Mercy requires us to <hi>enlarge</hi> the Proportion of our Alms; considering how great a Fall it is from <hi>Plenty</hi> to <hi>Necessity,</hi> and consequently how much more is necessary to raise up such <hi>dejected</hi> Creatures, who are so unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced to misery, into any degree of <hi>Comfort,</hi> or <hi>Self-enjoyment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly and Lastly, WE ought to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise our <hi>Prudence</hi> also in the <hi>Manner</hi> of bestowing and conveying our Alms; so as that we may oblige both by <hi>what</hi> we give, and by the <hi>way</hi> of our giving it. And accordingly <hi>Prudence</hi> will sometimes direct us to <hi>search</hi> and <hi>find</hi> out just Needs, and <hi>prevent</hi> the Poor from ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by <hi>surprizing</hi> them with a Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which they did not look for: by which means we shall strengthen their <hi>Faith</hi> in the Providence of God, who thus creates them Friends out of the Dust, and brings them Supplies without, and beyond their Expectations. And then in giving <hi>Prudence</hi> will direct us not to <hi>upbraid</hi> the Want, or <hi>insult</hi> over the Miseries of those we give to; for that would be to feed them with a Bit and a Knock, and to sophisticate our <hi>Mercy</hi> with <hi>Cruelty.</hi> And when any miserable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would borrow, or beg of us, <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:34683:127"/>
will advise us not to turn him away with <hi>Scorn;</hi> nor yet to remove him at a distance with signs of <hi>Disdain,</hi> or <hi>Contemptuous</hi> Violence; but if we see Reason to grant him his Request, to do it with a <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>open</hi> hand, that so the <hi>Freedom</hi> of our Charity may <hi>raise</hi> and <hi>enhanse</hi> the Comfort of it; and that that which we design for a <hi>Relief</hi> and <hi>Succour,</hi> may leave no <hi>Sting</hi> behind it in the Mind of the Receiver. And above all we ought to take especial Care, not to oppress the <hi>Modesty</hi> of the Humble, especially of those who have been wont to <hi>give,</hi> and not to <hi>receive;</hi> not to relieve them with <hi>lofty</hi> Looks, or <hi>angry</hi> Words, or a <hi>scornful</hi> and <hi>severe</hi> Behaviour; not to <hi>expose</hi> their Poverty by the divulging our Charity, or conveying it to them in the <hi>open View</hi> of the World; but to hand our Relief to them in such a <hi>secret</hi> and <hi>benign, courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>obliging</hi> manner, as that they may receive it with <hi>chearfulness,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Blushing</hi> and <hi>Confusion.</hi> And then as for those whose <hi>constant</hi> Necessities have habituated them to ask, and receive with more <hi>Confidence,</hi> and <hi>Assurance;</hi> our <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> will direct us to convey our Alms to them with such a mixture of <hi>Severity</hi> and <hi>Sweetness,</hi> as neither to encourage
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:34683:128"/>
them to grow upon our Charity, nor drive them into Desperation of it.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to press and enforce the <hi>Practice</hi> of this great Duty, with some <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Arguments,</hi> which are these that follow. First, <hi>Almsgiving</hi> is imposed upon us as a <hi>necessary</hi> Part of our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Secondly, 'Tis recommended to us by the <hi>Examples</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> Thirdly, It is a <hi>substantial</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of our <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> to God, and our Saviour. Fourthly, It charges an <hi>high Obligation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to us upon the Accounts of God, and our Saviour.</p>
               <p>I. CONSIDER that giving <hi>Alms</hi> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed upon us as a <hi>necessary</hi> Part of our <hi>Religion;</hi> that is, when God hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished us with <hi>Abilities</hi> and <hi>Opportunities</hi> to do it. For where we cannot give <hi>Mony</hi> to relieve the Poor, our <hi>Pity</hi> and our <hi>Prayers</hi> are accepted for Alms: <hi>for if there be a willing mind,</hi> (saith the Apostle) that is, a charitable Heart, <hi>it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not,</hi> 2 Cor. viii. 12. But where a Man hath, it is his indispensable duty to do accordingly: for <hi>Pure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:34683:128"/>
                  <hi>himself unspotted from the world,</hi> Jam. i. 27. And that this visitation is to be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an open and a liberal Hand, the same Apostle imformeth us, <hi>Iam.</hi> ii. 15, 16. <hi>If a brother or sister be naked and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, depart in peace, be you warmed and filled, notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body, what doth it profit?</hi> That is, if instead of <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Raiment,</hi> you only give him fair <hi>Words</hi> and good <hi>Wishes,</hi> what doth it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit him? Or what advantage can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to reap by it? And to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> iii. 17. <hi>But whoso hath this world's good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> that is, let him pretend what he pleases, he hath not one Spark of <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> or true <hi>Religion</hi> in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som. So that for Men to pretend to <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> who are <hi>able</hi> to relieve the Poor and yet <hi>refuse</hi> it, is one of the greatest <hi>Mockeries</hi> in the World: for howsoever Men's <hi>Covetousness</hi> may bribe their <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to dispense with the Obligations of <hi>Almsgiving,</hi> as if it were only a <hi>carnal</hi> Ordinance, or useless Relique of <hi>Popery;</hi> a <hi>holy</hi> Cheat, a <hi>devout</hi> Drunkard, a <hi>pious</hi>

Fornicator are not greater <hi>Contradictions</hi> in the sense of Scripture, than a <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted,</hi> a <hi>stingy,</hi> and a <hi>hide-bound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Saint For though our <hi>Religion</hi> doth by no means warrant us in such a vain and fond Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our good <hi>Works,</hi> as to think we <hi>merit</hi> Heaven by them; or to presume to drive a <hi>Bargain</hi> with God, by putting our <hi>good Works</hi> into the Ballance with an <hi>infinite</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Reward, our hopes of which we wholly owe to the <hi>infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of God through <hi>Iesus Christ;</hi> yet it requires them of us as a <hi>necessary Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> upon which God hath entailed all our future Bliss, and without which we can never hope for Admittance into the Kingdom of God. So that if we are <hi>able</hi> to relieve the Poor, and yet will <hi>not</hi> when we have <hi>Opportunity;</hi> by shutting up our Bowels against them, we shut the Door of Heaven against our <hi>selves;</hi> and must one day expect to receive the same An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer from God, that we give to them; I <hi>have nothing for you, no Mercy, no Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for such unmerciful Wretches, as would rather suffer their poor Brethren to perish, than part with a penny to relieve them.</hi> For of this Doom our Saviour himself hath fairly forewarned us, <hi>Matth.</hi> XXV. 41, 42, 43. <hi>Go ye cursed into everlasting fire; for when</hi>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:34683:129"/>
                  <hi>I was hungry, ye fed me not, when I was naked, ye cloathed me not:</hi> so that from any encouragement our Religion gives us, we may as well hope to go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> as without giving of <hi>Alms</hi> according to our Ability and Opportunity.</p>
               <p>II. CONSIDER that giving of <hi>Alms</hi> is highly recommended to us by the <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> of God, and our Saviour. For as for <hi>God,</hi> the whole Series of his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> is little else but a continued Dole of <hi>Alms</hi> and <hi>Charities</hi> to his Creatures: It was his <hi>Charity</hi> that <hi>founded</hi> this vast and magnificent <hi>Hospital</hi> of the World, that <hi>stock'd</hi> it with such a numberless Swarm of Creatures, and <hi>endow'd</hi> it with such plentiful Provisions for the Support and Maintenance of them all: so that we do all of us live upon <hi>his Alms,</hi> and depend upon <hi>his</hi> boundless <hi>Charity,</hi> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Breath of <hi>Air</hi> we draw, for every Bit of <hi>Bread</hi> we eat, and for every <hi>Rag</hi> of <hi>Cloaths</hi> we wear. And indeed what are all the <hi>Good Things</hi> of this World but so many Effluxes and Arguments of his <hi>Almighty, Liberality?</hi> Look every where about <hi>Nature,</hi> consider the whole Tenor of his <hi>Providence,</hi> survey all the Works and Actions of his <hi>Hands,</hi> and you shall
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:34683:130"/>
find them all conspiring in that amiable Character the Psalmist gives of him, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxix. 68. <hi>Thou art good, and thou dost good.</hi> So that in relieving the Necessities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers we act the Part, and the best Part too of the <hi>Almighty Father</hi> of Beings; who sits at the upper End of the Table, and carves to his whole Creation. Hence St. <hi>Gregory Nazian.</hi> speaking of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Man, saith that he is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> i. e. <hi>A God to the unfortunate, imitating the Mercies of God; for Man hath in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so much of God, as in doing good;</hi> which is doubtless the most <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>Godlike</hi> thing, that a Creature is capable of. What then can be more honourable, or more becoming a <hi>Creature,</hi> than to tread in the Footsteps of <hi>God,</hi> to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe <hi>his</hi> Nature and Actions, and be a kind of <hi>Vice-God</hi> in the World? Surely did we but understand and consider, how <hi>divinely magnificent</hi> it is to <hi>supply</hi> the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, and <hi>contribute</hi> to the Happiness of others; we should court it as our <hi>highest Preferment,</hi> and bless God upon our bended Knees for deeming us wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of such an <hi>illustrious Employment,</hi> and that among the numerous Blessings he
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34683:130"/>
hath heaped upon us, he hath vouchsafed to admit us to <hi>share</hi> with himself in the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>doing Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AND as the Example of <hi>God</hi> doth high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommend to us relieving of the <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>miserable,</hi> so also doth the Example of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> For it was for <hi>this</hi> that he left his Father's Bosom, and came down from Heaven into our Nature, that he might <hi>relieve</hi> a poor perishing World, and <hi>rescue</hi> it from Eternal Ruin. And what a <hi>glorious</hi> Recommendation of <hi>Charity</hi> is this, that the Son of God chose rather to <hi>do good</hi> upon Earth, than to <hi>reign</hi> over Angels in Heaven? And while he was here, the sole Employment he thought <hi>worthy</hi> of himself, was to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> the Miserable, to <hi>feed</hi> the Hungry, to <hi>cure</hi> the Blind and the Lame, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store</hi> the Sick, to <hi>instruct</hi> the Ignorant, and <hi>reclaim</hi> the Rebellious. This was the <hi>Drift</hi> of all his Actions, this the <hi>Subject</hi> of his Miracles, and this the <hi>Scope</hi> of all his Doctrines: So that his whole <hi>Life</hi> was nothing else but a continued Train of <hi>Beneficencies;</hi> for the Apostle telleth us in the x. of the <hi>Act.</hi> 38. that <hi>he went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout doing good.</hi> Consider this therefore, O thou <hi>hard-hearted</hi> Christian, that stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest thy Ears, against the poor Man's
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:34683:131"/>
Cries! What would thy <hi>blessed Lord</hi> have done, had he been in <hi>thy</hi> Case and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances? Would <hi>He,</hi> who had so much <hi>Compassion</hi> on the Multitude, as to work a <hi>Miracle</hi> to feed them, have turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that miserable Wretch away as thou dost, without the least Dram of <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Relief?</hi> Would <hi>He,</hi> whose Heart and Hand was always <hi>open</hi> to the Poor and Miserable, have <hi>despised</hi> the poor Man's Moans as <hi>thou dost,</hi> or <hi>shut</hi> his Bowels of Compassion against him? Do but peruse the Pattern of <hi>his</hi> Life, and scan over <hi>his</hi> whole Behaviour; and see if there be any one Action in all that great <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar,</hi> that doth not upbraid thee, and cry <hi>Shame</hi> upon thee for entitling thy <hi>narrow, cruel,</hi> and <hi>stingy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Self a <hi>Disciple</hi> to such a <hi>merciful, generous</hi> and <hi>liberal</hi> Master; and if so, learn for the future either to be so <hi>honest</hi> as to follow his Rule and Example, or else so <hi>modest</hi> as to disclaim thy Relation to him.</p>
               <p>III. CONSIDER that giving of <hi>Alms</hi> is a most <hi>substantial</hi> Expression of our <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> to God, and our Saviour. How much we are obliged to express our <hi>Gratitude</hi> to God, for these our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Enjoyments</hi> and <hi>Abilities</hi> to do good to others, is evident from hence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:34683:131"/>
we <hi>receive</hi> them from him and do <hi>hold</hi> in vertue of his Donation. For to suppose our selves <hi>independent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Possessors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> of them, is in effect to <hi>devest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God</hi> of his Dominion, and to <hi>strip him</hi> into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant Cypher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that only sits above in the Heavens, like an Almighty, <hi>Sarda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napalus,</hi> with his Arms folded in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som; and no further concerning himself in the Affairs of this lower World, than to look down from his Throne, and please himself to see Men scrambling for their several Shares of it. But if we suppose him, as we have infinite Reason to do, the <hi>Almighty,</hi> Author, and <hi>Supream</hi> Disposer of all things; then we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that 'tis from <hi>his</hi> overflowing <hi>Bounty</hi> that we derive whatever we pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess; that 'tis the Gold of <hi>his</hi> Mines that enriches us, the Crops of <hi>his</hi> Fields that feed us, the Fleeces of <hi>his</hi> Beasts that cloath us, and that <hi>every</hi> Good Thing we enjoy is handed to us by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of <hi>his</hi> all-disposing <hi>Providence.</hi> And since we owe all to <hi>his Bounty,</hi> and in our greatest Flourish are but <hi>his Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> and <hi>Pensioners;</hi> how deeply are we obliged to return upon him in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving?</hi> And since <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> consist either
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:34683:132"/>
in the Affection of the <hi>Mind,</hi> or in the verbal <hi>Signification</hi> of it, or in the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual <hi>Performance</hi> of good things to the Person whom we <hi>thank</hi> and <hi>love;</hi> this last is the most <hi>compleat</hi> and <hi>substantial</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the <hi>Reality</hi> of our Words and Affections. For though <hi>Good-Will</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Root of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> yet <hi>that</hi> lying under Ground and out of sight, we cannot conclude its Being and Life without <hi>visible Fruits</hi> of Beneficence to the Person whom we <hi>thank</hi> and <hi>love:</hi> And as for <hi>good Words,</hi> they are at best but the <hi>Leaves</hi> of Love and Gratitude; but 'tis <hi>good Works</hi> that are the real <hi>Fruits</hi> of them, by which their <hi>Sincerity</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated. For as no Man doth ever impress a <hi>false</hi> Stamp upon the <hi>finest</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, so <hi>costly</hi> Thanks and Love are sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>counterfeit.</hi> It is to decline spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Goods,</hi> or their <hi>Pains,</hi> that Men do so often <hi>forge</hi> and <hi>feign,</hi> pretending to make up in <hi>wishing</hi> well the Defects of <hi>doing</hi> so, and paying down <hi>Words</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>Things:</hi> But where <hi>Works</hi> are wanting, there is no <hi>Expression</hi> of our Love or Gratitude can either be <hi>real</hi> in it self, or <hi>acceptable</hi> to God. So that we may spare our <hi>Breath,</hi> if we keep back our <hi>Substance;</hi> for our <hi>close</hi> Hand giveth
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:34683:132"/>
the lye to our <hi>full</hi> Mouth, and all our <hi>verbal Praises</hi> of God, when we will part with nothing for his sake, are only so many <hi>empty Compliments,</hi> and <hi>down-right Mockeries.</hi> But then do our Love and Gratitude to God discover their <hi>Reality,</hi> when it appears by our <hi>Actions</hi> that we think nothing too dear for him; when for <hi>his</hi> sake who hath fed and clothed us and abundantly supplied <hi>our</hi> Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, we are ready upon all Opportunities to feed and cloath and supply the Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>others.</hi> And can we think any Thing <hi>too dear,</hi> by which we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press our Gratitude to <hi>Him,</hi> upon whose overflowing Bounty we depend for <hi>every Blessing</hi> we have, or hope for; who hath provided not only this <hi>Temporal</hi> World for our <hi>Bodies,</hi> but also an <hi>Eternal</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for our <hi>Souls;</hi> and hath sent his <hi>Son</hi> to us from his own Bosom to tread out our Way to it, and conduct us thither? Or can we think any Thanks <hi>too costly</hi> for that <hi>blessed Son,</hi> who never grudged to come down from Heaven into this Vale of Miseries, and pour out his <hi>Blood</hi> for our sakes? Was it not much harder for Him to part with <hi>Heaven,</hi> than 'tis for you to part with a little <hi>Mony?</hi> And can you think it much to bestow an <hi>Alms</hi> for <hi>his</hi> sake, who never grudged to lay
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:34683:133"/>
down his <hi>Life</hi> for <hi>yours?</hi> This is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the Apostle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 9. <hi>For ye know the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sakes the became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. CONSIDER that giving of <hi>Alms</hi> charges an <hi>high Obligation</hi> to us, upon the Accounts of <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Saviour.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> lends the poor Man his <hi>Name,</hi> and allows him to crave our Succours for <hi>his</hi> sake: He gives him <hi>Credit</hi> from <hi>himself</hi> to <hi>us</hi> for what he stands in need of, and bids him charge what he receives upon <hi>his own</hi> Account, permitting to reckon Himself <hi>obliged</hi> thereby, and to write Him down our <hi>Debtor:</hi> So that when we stop our Ears to the Cries of the <hi>Poor,</hi> he reckons <hi>himself</hi> repulsed by us, and interprets it as a rude Affront offered to his <hi>own Person,</hi> it being offered to one that bears his <hi>Name,</hi> and wears his <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</hi> For the <hi>poor Man's</hi> Rags are the Badges of his Relation to <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Wants</hi> are the Mouths by which <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self intreats our Relief, and Succour; assuring us that he will reckon it to our selves, and accept it as kindly at our hands as if we had relieved Him in <hi>his own</hi> Person. <hi>For he that hath pity upon the poor,</hi> (saith the Wise Man) <hi>lendeth</hi>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:34683:133"/>
                  <hi>unto the Lord,</hi> Prov. xix. 17. in which one Sentence methinks there is more Rhetorick, than in a whole Library of Sermons: And surely did we but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, and consider it in its full <hi>Emphasis,</hi> we should not need such Volumes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, but might easily learn to be charitable by an <hi>Epitome.</hi> 
                  <q>O blessed God! that thou should'st own thy self my Debtor, only for repaying thee a Part of what thou hast lent me, and of what is still thine own by an unalienable Propriety; that thou who art the great Landlord of the World, should'st thus acknowledge thy self indebted to thy poor Tenant, for paying thee a small Quit-rent, a Pepper-corn of Homage for what I hold in thy Right, and by thy Bounty!</q> And yet thus it is, he <hi>lends</hi> us our Estates, and then writes himself our <hi>Debtor,</hi> for that small Part which we <hi>repay</hi> him in Works of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> And as God putteth our Alms to his own account, so doth our Saviour also: For so, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxv. 40. <hi>In as much</hi> (saith he) <hi>as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me;</hi> that is, I account my self obliged by it, and do receive it at your hands with the same <hi>Kindness</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:34683:134"/>
and <hi>Acceptance,</hi> as if you had been with me in my state of Humiliation, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me all this Mercy in my <hi>own Person.</hi> And when both <hi>God</hi> and my <hi>Saviour</hi> do send a poor Wretch to me in <hi>their</hi> own <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> and desire me for <hi>their</hi> Sakes and upon <hi>their</hi> Accounts to relieve him; Can I be either so <hi>ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> to whom I am indebted for all that I have or do hope for, or so <hi>wanting</hi> to my own <hi>Interest,</hi> as to <hi>neglect</hi> so fair an Opportunity of making them some <hi>Return</hi> of their Favours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>obliging</hi> them to heap more Favours upon me? For when in giving to the Poor I give to <hi>God</hi> and my <hi>Saviour,</hi> what glorious <hi>Compensations</hi> may I expect from such <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>liberal</hi> Pay-Masters? <hi>he that soweth bountifully shall reap bountifully,</hi> saith the Apostle, speaking of <hi>Alms,</hi> 2 Cor. ix. 6. for he soweth in the richest Soil, in the fruitful Hands of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Saviour;</hi> where the Seed being nourished with <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Bounty</hi> never faileth to increase and multiply a thousand-fold. <hi>For God is not unrighteous, to forget your work and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of love which ye have shewed towards his name, in that ye have ministred to the Saints and do minister,</hi> Heb. vi. 10. Though he may sometimes <hi>defer,</hi> yet he never
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:34683:134"/>
                  <hi>forgets</hi> to return a charitable Work: So that you may <hi>safely</hi> reckon upon it, that so much as you have bestowed in Works of Charity, so much with vast <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> you have <hi>secured</hi> to you in the Hands of <hi>God;</hi> who will either return it to you hither in <hi>Temporal</hi> Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, or, which is a thousand times bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, repay it to you with infinite Interest in the weight of your <hi>Eternal</hi> Crown. For so our Saviour promises the young Man, that if he would <hi>give</hi> what he had to the <hi>poor,</hi> he should have <hi>treasure in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Matth. xix. 21. So that by giving <hi>Alms</hi> we make Earth tributary to Heaven, and in a nobler sense than the new Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem of <hi>Astronomy</hi> teaches, advance it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Celestial</hi> Body; and consequently enrich not only our <hi>Selves,</hi> but our <hi>Wealth</hi> too, by thus <hi>transmitting</hi> it to Heaven before us, as it were by <hi>Bills</hi> of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, to be repaid us when we come there in an <hi>everlasting Treasure</hi> of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. And when by relieving the <hi>poor Man's</hi> needs, we may thus transmute our <hi>Dross</hi> into <hi>Gold,</hi> and, which is more, our <hi>perishing</hi> Gold into <hi>immortal</hi> Glory, What<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Man in his Wits would refuse any fair Opportunity of making such a <hi>blessed Exchange?</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Natural Reasons and Grounds of <hi>Mercy.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HAVING shewn at large what <hi>Mercy</hi> is, and to what particular <hi>Duties</hi> it extends, I shall now proceed to the second thing, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Eternal Reasons</hi> upon which it is founded and rendred <hi>morally Good.</hi> Which I shall reduce to these five Particulars;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, THE Suitableness of it to the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God:</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, THE Convenience of it with the <hi>Frame</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Thirdly, THE <hi>near</hi> and <hi>intimate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of those Persons to us upon whom our Mercy is to be exercised:</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, THE <hi>Equitableness</hi> of it to <hi>our own</hi> State and Circumstances:</item>
                  <item>Fifthly, THE <hi>Necessity</hi> of it to the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Well-being of <hi>Humane Society.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>I. ONE eternal Reason upon which <hi>Mercy</hi> is founded and rendered <hi>morally Good,</hi> is the Suitableness of it to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> which abounding as it doth
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:34683:135"/>
with all the possible Kinds and Degrees of <hi>Perfection,</hi> is an <hi>infinitely full</hi> and <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi> Fountain of Happiness to <hi>it self;</hi> so that it cannot wish for any Kind, or any Degree of <hi>Blessedness</hi> beyond the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of <hi>it self,</hi> and those infinite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placencies it takes in its <hi>own</hi> essential <hi>Beauties</hi> and <hi>Perfections:</hi> And having such an <hi>inexhaustible</hi> Treasure of Happiness within <hi>it self,</hi> it can have no <hi>Need</hi> of, or <hi>Dependence</hi> upon any thing <hi>without</hi> it; nor consequently be liable to any temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to oppress, or render others mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, either for the <hi>Security,</hi> or <hi>Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi> of its own Revenues: And as he who is <hi>infinitely happy</hi> can have no Temptation to render others <hi>miserable,</hi> so his own <hi>Happiness</hi> cannot but incline him to render the miserable <hi>happy</hi> For so from a Natural Principle of <hi>Self-Love,</hi> every Being stands inclined to beget, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate its own <hi>Likeness;</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every Being that is <hi>happy</hi> cannot but be inclined to make <hi>others</hi> so, so far as it consists with its own Interest. Since therefore <hi>God</hi> is not only happy in <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> but so securely happy as that he can contribute what he pleases to the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of <hi>others</hi> without any Prejudice to his own; his own <hi>Self-Love,</hi> must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily

incline him to beget his own <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> on his Creatures, and so <hi>propagate</hi> his Happiness through the World. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus inclined by his own <hi>Self-Love</hi> to transform all other Beings into his <hi>Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> that is, to make them happy as he is happy; he must needs be tenderly affected with the Miseries of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and immutably inclined, so far as it is just and wise, to <hi>succour</hi> and <hi>relieve</hi> and render them <hi>happy.</hi> Thus <hi>Mercy,</hi> you see, which is a Good Will to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, doth most necessarily result from God's own <hi>Self-Love;</hi> and consequently is an inseparable <hi>Principle</hi> of his <hi>Nature:</hi> And accordingly God proclaims himself to <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. xxxiv. 6, 7. <hi>The Lord, the Lord God merciful and gracious, longsuffering, abud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions:</hi> And hence his Mercy is said to be <hi>everlasting,</hi> Psal. c. 5. and to be <hi>from everlasting,</hi> Psal ciii. 17. and to <hi>endure for ever,</hi> Psal. cvi. 1. and he is said to be <hi>rich in mercy,</hi> Ephes. ii. 4. and is stiled <hi>the God of all grace,</hi> 1 Pet. v. 10. and the <hi>Father of mercies,</hi> 2 Cor. i. 3. Now the <hi>Nature</hi> of God is the supream <hi>Example,</hi> and <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi> of all Rational Natures; and so far forth as <hi>ours</hi> do swerve and deflect from
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:34683:136"/>
                  <hi>his,</hi> they are maimed and imperfect. For his <hi>Will</hi> is our <hi>Law,</hi> not meerly because 'tis his Will, but because it is over-ruled by the <hi>infinite Perfections</hi> of his Nature, by his Wisdom and Justice, his Mercy and Goodness; which if upon an <hi>impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> Supposition he should will contrary to, <hi>that</hi> Will would be <hi>no</hi> Law, <hi>i. e.</hi> it would have no force upon our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to oblige us to obey it. So that the supream Law is the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> by which his Will <hi>is,</hi> and all other Wills <hi>ought</hi> to be concluded and determined; and whatsoever we discover in <hi>his</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture either by <hi>Reason,</hi> or <hi>Revelation,</hi> that is communicable to <hi>ours,</hi> we ought to follow and imitate it as our Soveraign <hi>Pattern</hi> and <hi>Exemplar.</hi> Since therefore both <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Revelation</hi> do so plainly discover a most <hi>merciful</hi> Inclination in the <hi>Nature</hi> of God; this is an everlasting Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why we should be merciful: And this is the Reason our Saviour urges, <hi>Luk.</hi> vi. 36. <hi>be ye merciful as your Father also is merciful;</hi> that is, Let it be seen that you are the <hi>Children</hi> of God, by your participation of his <hi>Nature,</hi> which is infinitely <hi>benevolent</hi> to the Miserable; for there is nothing sinks you farther from God, or renders you more <hi>unlike</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:34683:137"/>
him, than a <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>unmerciful</hi> Temper: 'Tis this that blackens and deforms your Souls, that wreaths and distorts them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>contrary</hi> Figure to the most amiable <hi>Nature</hi> of the Father of Spirits. For as the highest Perfection is the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and that is a most <hi>merciful</hi> one; so the lowest Imperfection is the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Devils,</hi> and that is a most <hi>cruel</hi> one: And therefore as by <hi>Mercy</hi> we incline towards the Nature of <hi>God,</hi> which is the <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> we ought to follow; so by <hi>Cruelty</hi> we decline towards the Nature of <hi>Devils,</hi> which is the <hi>Sea-mark</hi> we ought to avoid.</p>
               <p>II. ANOTHER eternal Reason upon which <hi>Mercy</hi> is founded and rendered <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Good,</hi> is the Convenience of it with the <hi>Frame:</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>Humane Nature;</hi> in which the wise Author of Nature hath implanted a <hi>natural Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> between those that partake of it, in each others Pains and Pleasures, So that though the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> be largely <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused</hi> and <hi>spread</hi> through infinite <hi>Numbers</hi> of Individuals, which by vast distances of Time and Place are separated from one another; yet as if it were but all one <hi>common</hi> Soul, operating in <hi>several</hi> Bodies in <hi>several</hi> Times and Places, it feels al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in every <hi>one</hi> Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what it enjoys,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:34683:137"/>
or suffers in every <hi>other;</hi> and whether it be pleased, or offended in <hi>one</hi> Individual, is pleased or offended in them <hi>all:</hi> And though the Sense be <hi>quickest</hi> in that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual Part, or Member of Humane Nature, upon which the <hi>Pain</hi> or <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> strikes immediately; yet all the <hi>rest</hi> how distant soever in Time or Place, as soon as they have <hi>notice</hi> of it, are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly <hi>touched</hi> and <hi>affected</hi> with it. For thus when we read, or hear of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of <hi>other</hi> Men, our Bowels yern by a <hi>natural Sympathy,</hi> though they are never so distant from us, and are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise related to us than as they <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take</hi> of our <hi>Natures;</hi> and though they are long since dead, and out of the reach of any Assistance, yet their Miseries with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Motives of <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Discourse</hi> strike us into a soft <hi>Compassion;</hi> yea though we know the Calamities which we read or hear of, to be nothing but <hi>Romantick</hi> Fictions, yet the very <hi>Imagination</hi> of them is ready to melt us into Tears in despight of our <hi>Will</hi> and our <hi>Reason.</hi> Nor is this visible only in Persons that are <hi>adult,</hi> but even in little <hi>Children;</hi> who as soon as they are capable of taking notice of things, do without any <hi>Reason</hi> express themselves pained and afflicted with the dissembled <hi>Griefs</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of those
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:34683:138"/>
that attend them. All which are most evident Instances of that general <hi>Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> which naturally intercedes between all Men; since we can neither see, nor hear of, nor imagine <hi>anothers Miseries,</hi> without being touched with a sensible <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Affliction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AGAINST which I know no other Objection can be urged but this; that there are sundry Instances of Men, who seem to have arrived to that degree of <hi>Cruelty,</hi> as to take Pleasure in afflicting <hi>others;</hi> and are so far from <hi>Sympathizing</hi> with their Pains, that they rather seem to be <hi>recreated</hi> with them. To which I shall only answer these two things: First, That that Delight which some Men take in plaguing and afflicting <hi>others,</hi> proceeds not from their <hi>natural Temper,</hi> but is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be attributed to some violent <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervency,</hi> and <hi>Transport</hi> of their Natures; such as are outragious <hi>Anger,</hi> or deep and inveterate <hi>Revenge;</hi> under both which Nature is <hi>discomposed</hi> and <hi>disordered,</hi> and chafed into a <hi>preternatural Ferment:</hi> And accordingly when it is cooled again, and reduced to a <hi>composed</hi> Temper, instead of <hi>rejoycing</hi> in the Mischiefs it hath done, it usually <hi>bewails</hi> and <hi>laments</hi> them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon them with a great deal of
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:34683:138"/>
                  <hi>Horror</hi> and <hi>Remorse.</hi> Which is a plain Argument, that Humane Nature in it self is very <hi>tender</hi> and <hi>compassionate;</hi> how much soever it may be <hi>accidentally</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported, by unnatural Passion superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced upon it. Secondly, Suppose what is objected be true, that there are some Natures so <hi>cankered,</hi> and <hi>Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd,</hi> as to be really <hi>pleased</hi> with the Pains and Miseries of <hi>others;</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of this kind are so <hi>few,</hi> that they are only so many <hi>Exceptions</hi> to a Gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Rule;</hi> and therefore ought rather to be looked <hi>upon</hi> as so many <hi>Monsters</hi> of Men, than as the Standards of <hi>Humane Nature.</hi> For as we do not look upon it as <hi>natural</hi> to Men to be born without Hands or Feet, though there have been Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of such <hi>monstrous</hi> and <hi>unnatural</hi> Births; so neither ought we to think it <hi>natural</hi> to Men to be <hi>cruel</hi> and <hi>unmerciful,</hi> because of a <hi>few</hi> Devils in Humane Shape, that have pulled out their own Bowels of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.</hi> If we would understand what is <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>natural,</hi> we must take our Measures from those who in all <hi>other</hi> cases do live most conformably to the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> and to be sure the more <hi>regular</hi> Mens Natures are, the more you will find them abounding with Pity and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:34683:139"/>
                  <hi>Compassion.</hi> For hence it is that <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Compassion</hi> are called <hi>Good Nature</hi> and <hi>Humanity,</hi> and their contraries <hi>Ill Nature</hi> and <hi>Inhumanity;</hi> because as the former are inseparable Properties of <hi>well-formed</hi> and <hi>regulated</hi> Natures; so the latter are such hideous <hi>Deformities</hi> of Nature, as do in effect devest us of our <hi>Manhood,</hi> and render us a kind of <hi>Monsters</hi> among Men. By all which it is evident, that the great Creator hath framed and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed our Nature to <hi>Mercy,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in it a <hi>tender Sympathy</hi> and <hi>fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feelling</hi> of each others Miseries; by which, as by a Voice from Heaven, he doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally call upon us to let out these our <hi>natural</hi> Compassions into <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> towards one another. For the Voice of <hi>Nature</hi> is a genuine <hi>Eccho,</hi> and Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Voice of <hi>God;</hi> who, by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating in us such a tender <hi>Sympathy</hi> with one another, doth most expresly signifie, that it is his Will that we should mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>succour</hi> and <hi>relieve</hi> each other. For to what other end should he create in me such a <hi>Feeling</hi> of my Brother's miseries, but only to provoke me by it to <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>succour</hi> him? why should he cause me to <hi>partake,</hi> as I do, of other Mens <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Pleasures,</hi> but to excite me
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:34683:139"/>
thereby to use my best endeavour to <hi>asswage</hi> their <hi>Pains,</hi> and <hi>advance</hi> their <hi>Pleasures?</hi> Since therefore the <hi>God</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath made my <hi>Neighbour's</hi> Misery <hi>my</hi> Pain, and <hi>his</hi> Content <hi>my</hi> Pleasure; and by the indissoluble Bands of mutual <hi>Sympathy</hi> hath linked our Fortunes and Affections together, so that 'tis for my <hi>own</hi> Ease to ease <hi>him,</hi> and for my <hi>own</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to please <hi>him;</hi> this is an eternal and immutable Reason, why I should be <hi>merciful</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>III. ANOTHER <hi>eternal Reason</hi> upon which <hi>Mercy</hi> is founded, and by which it is constituted <hi>morally Good,</hi> is the near and intimate <hi>Relation</hi> of those Persons to us, upon whom our <hi>Mercy</hi> is to be exercised. For there is between Men, and Men a most intimate <hi>Kindred</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi> as being all derived from one <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Root,</hi> whose prolifick Sap hath sprout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into infinite Branches, which, like the Boughs of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar's</hi> Tree, have spread themselves to all the ends of the Earth. And as we are all Children of the <hi>same Parents,</hi> and consequently <hi>Brethren</hi> by Nature; so we do all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate of the <hi>same Nature,</hi> as being compounded of the same <hi>Materials,</hi> and animated with the same <hi>Forms,</hi> having
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:34683:140"/>
all the <hi>same</hi> Faculties, Inclinations, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and Affections; and being only so many several <hi>Copies,</hi> transcribed from the same <hi>Original:</hi> and there is no other <hi>Difference</hi> between us, but what is made by things that are <hi>extrinsick</hi> and <hi>acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> to our Natures. So that in short we are <hi>all</hi> but <hi>one,</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> Substance, attired in a diverse Garb of <hi>Circumstances,</hi> divided into several <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi> and diversify'd by the little <hi>Accidents</hi> of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Stature, Figure and Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: in all which perhaps within a little while we shall <hi>differ</hi> as much from our <hi>selves,</hi> as we do now from <hi>other</hi> Men. For do but compare your selves in your <hi>Youth,</hi> or in your <hi>Health,</hi> or in your <hi>Prosperity,</hi> with your selves in your <hi>Age,</hi> or in your <hi>Sickness,</hi> or in your <hi>Adversity;</hi> and you will find as much <hi>Difference</hi> between your <hi>selves</hi> and your <hi>selves,</hi> as you do now between your <hi>selves</hi> and <hi>others:</hi> so that in reality <hi>other</hi> Men are as much <hi>you</hi> now, as <hi>you</hi> are your <hi>selves</hi> in other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; we being all the same in every <hi>stable, essential</hi> Ingredient of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and being only diversified by such <hi>Accidents</hi> from one another, as will in a little time diversifie us from our selves. Thus the Apostle saith, <hi>Acts</hi> xvii. 26. <hi>He</hi>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:34683:140"/>
                  <hi>hath made of one blood,</hi> that is, of one Nature, <hi>all nations of men to dwell on the face of the earth.</hi> There being therefore such a close Conjunction, such a strict Union of <hi>Natures</hi> between Men and Men, so that every <hi>other</hi> Man is every other Man's <hi>self,</hi> a few trifling Circumstances excepted; this is an everlasting Reason, why we should treat <hi>them</hi> as we do our <hi>selves,</hi> with all Compassion and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. For to commiserate <hi>one</hi> who is my other <hi>self,</hi> is that which I am obliged to by own <hi>Self-Love,</hi> which God hath made an eternal <hi>Law</hi> to my <hi>Nature:</hi> 'tis to feed a Member of my own <hi>Body,</hi> and nourish a Branch of my own <hi>Root;</hi> yea, 'tis to feed and succour my own <hi>Nature,</hi> that is only individuate from mine by I know not what <hi>Metaphysical</hi> Principle, and cloathed in different <hi>Accidents,</hi> and <hi>Circumstances.</hi> So that now the very same <hi>Self-Love,</hi> which doth so importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately instigate us upon all occasions to redress our <hi>own</hi> miseries, ought in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to provoke us to relieve and succour <hi>other</hi> Men; since all the Miseries <hi>they</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure are the Miseries of <hi>our own</hi> Nature: insomuch that we run <hi>their</hi> Fortunes, and by a natural Communion are <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers</hi> of <hi>their</hi> Pains and Pleasures. For
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:34683:141"/>
the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> which is common to <hi>us</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> endures the smart of their afflictions, and bleeds through every wound that is given them; so that by pouring into those Wounds the Balsam of our <hi>Mercy,</hi> we do an Act of <hi>kindness</hi> to our <hi>selves,</hi> and wisely consult our <hi>own</hi> Preservation. As on the contrary by dealing cruelly, and unmercifully by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men, we do <hi>affront</hi> and <hi>violate</hi> our <hi>own</hi> Natures; and most unnaturally thwart that Principle of <hi>self-love,</hi> which God hath implanted in us for our own Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. For he whom thou treatest with so much <hi>Contempt</hi> and <hi>Cruelty</hi> is thy own <hi>self</hi> individuated into another Person; and wears thy <hi>Nature</hi> under other Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances: he is Man of thy Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, Flesh of thy Flesh, and Bone of thy Bone; and <hi>no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourisheth and cherisheth it: Eph.</hi> v. 29. Wherefore thou canst not deal cruelly by <hi>him,</hi> without wounding thy <hi>self</hi> through his sides, and committing an <hi>unnatural Outrage</hi> upon the <hi>Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> whereof he is equally <hi>Partaker</hi> with thee.</p>
               <p>IV. ANOTHER <hi>eternal Reason</hi> upon which <hi>Mercy</hi> is founded, and rendered <hi>morally Good,</hi> is the <hi>Equitableness</hi> of it to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:34683:141"/>
our own State and Circumstances: for no Man ever was, or ever can be so happy, as not to have <hi>need</hi> of <hi>Mercy</hi> for himself. The <hi>best</hi> of Men are <hi>Sinners</hi> before God, and for that are liable without a World of <hi>Mercy</hi> to be rendered miserable for ever; and there are very <hi>few</hi> whose Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with Men have been so inoffensive, as never to have merited <hi>severe Retribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> at their Hands: and how <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>prosperous</hi> soever a Man's outward State and Circumstances may be at <hi>present,</hi> he cannot be <hi>secure,</hi> but the next Turn of Affairs may tumble him headlong thence into <hi>Wretchedness</hi> and <hi>Calamity.</hi> Now since every Man <hi>might</hi> have been, or <hi>may</hi> be miserable, what can be more <hi>just</hi> or <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable,</hi> than that we should deal with <hi>those</hi> that are so, as we would be dealt by if <hi>we</hi> were so? Put the case then, as you may very reasonably do, that <hi>You</hi> were now as miserable as that <hi>Wretched</hi> Creature is that craveth your Succour and Relief; would not <hi>you</hi> desire Relief with the same <hi>Importunity</hi> that <hi>he doth?</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you would; the Sense of <hi>Misery,</hi> and the Desire of <hi>Miercy</hi> being naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable: well, but why would <hi>you</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire it? Why, <hi>Because you are miserable,</hi> you would say: and hath not <hi>he</hi> the same
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:34683:142"/>
Reason to desire it of <hi>you?</hi> You may <hi>want</hi> what he <hi>desires,</hi> and if you should, you cannot deny but you should <hi>desire</hi> the <hi>same:</hi> and is there not all the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the World, why you should <hi>grant</hi> him what you would <hi>ask</hi> for your self, if you were in his Circumstances, and he in yours? This therefore is eternally rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, that we should <hi>give,</hi> and <hi>ask</hi> by the same Measures; that we should <hi>grant</hi> that Succour to those that are miserable, which we should think fit to <hi>ask</hi> or <hi>desire</hi> of them, were We as <hi>miserable</hi> as They, and They as happy as We. For since we are all of us naturally <hi>equal,</hi> whatsoever is fit for <hi>one,</hi> must be fit for <hi>another</hi> in <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual</hi> Circumstances. Either therefore it is not fit, that I should <hi>desire</hi> Relief <hi>from</hi> others when I am miserable, or else it is fit, that I should <hi>grant</hi> Relief <hi>to</hi> others when they are so: which if I refuse, I must condemn my self, either for being <hi>unreasonable</hi> in desiring Mercy when I <hi>need</hi> it, or for being <hi>unjust</hi> in denying Mercy when I am <hi>asked</hi> it. I know, I may be miserable my self; and if ever I am, I know I cannot forbear desiring <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> to succour and relieve <hi>me:</hi> and can I blame them for desiring that of <hi>me,</hi> which I could not forbear desiring of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:34683:142"/>
                  <hi>them,</hi> were I in their Circumstances, and <hi>they</hi> in <hi>mine?</hi> And yet of necessity I must either blame them for <hi>desiring</hi> of <hi>me</hi> what they do, or blame my <hi>self</hi> for <hi>refusing</hi> them what <hi>they</hi> desire; since whatsoever is <hi>just</hi> for them to desire of <hi>me,</hi> is very fit and <hi>reasonable</hi> for me to grant them: and if ever <hi>I</hi> should happen to want <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> with what Face can I <hi>desire,</hi> or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi> it, who am deaf and inexorable to the Wants of <hi>others?</hi> So that if I will <hi>shew</hi> no Mercy, I were best take heed that I never <hi>need</hi> any; for if I should, it will be very <hi>unreasonable</hi> for me to expect it; because by my <hi>unmerciful</hi> Treatment of <hi>others,</hi> I have made a <hi>Precedent</hi> against my <hi>self;</hi> against which it would be Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for me to plead for Mercy, either with God, or Men. With what Face can I supplicate for <hi>Mercy</hi> from the Hands of others, when I have so plainly declared by my <hi>Actions,</hi> that were I in <hi>their</hi> stead, and They in <hi>mine,</hi> I would never grant <hi>them</hi> what <hi>I</hi> ask for? And when my <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> do thus loudly deprecate the <hi>Mercies</hi> which I pray for, and enter such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable <hi>Caveat</hi> against my Claim and Pretence to them, it is but modest to let fall my Suit, and give up my Hope of <hi>Mercy</hi> for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:34683:143"/>Fifthly and Lastly, ANOTHER <hi>eternal</hi> Reason upon which <hi>Mercy</hi> is founded, and rendered <hi>morally Good,</hi> is the Necessity of it to the tolerable Well-being of <hi>Humane Societies.</hi> That <hi>God</hi> is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> to his Creatures, hath been sufficiently demonstrated from the <hi>infinite</hi> Beatitude of his Nature; which being an <hi>unbounded</hi> Ocean of Bliss and Happiness to it <hi>self,</hi> must needs be abundantly communicative of Bliss and Happiness to <hi>others,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Capacities</hi> of their <hi>Natures.</hi> Since therefore <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> of all these sublunary Ones, contains the largest <hi>Capacities</hi> of Happiness; we may be sure that God not only <hi>designs</hi> its Welfare, but that he hath made all the <hi>Provisions</hi> for it that are necessary in order thereunto. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding which, you see he hath at <hi>present</hi> exposed it to so many evil <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi> and <hi>Contingencies;</hi> that unless those that are <hi>happy</hi> will take some care of the <hi>miserable,</hi> and we will all of us <hi>mutually</hi> succour and relieve one another, there is not a <hi>sufficient Provision</hi> made for our tolerable well-being in this World. Since therefore it is evident even from the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Principles</hi> of God's Nature, that he is infinitely <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>benevolent</hi> to us; and yet notwithstanding this, he hath

placed us in a condition wherein we need <hi>one another's</hi> Mercy, and cannot be happy without it; it necessarily follows, that it is his Will and Pleasure that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>insoever he hath left us unprovided, we should <hi>mutually</hi> provide for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that our <hi>own Mercy</hi> should be instead of a <hi>Counterpart</hi> to supply those <hi>Defects</hi> and void <hi>Spaces,</hi> which his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath left us in our <hi>present</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For we being <hi>free Agents,</hi> God did not so provide for our Happiness, as to <hi>exclude</hi> our own <hi>Virtue</hi> from having an hand in it; but hath only taken care so to dispose and order our Affairs, as that we may be happy; if we will <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute</hi> our <hi>Part,</hi> and behave our selves towards <hi>him, our selves,</hi> and <hi>one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> so as is most conducive to our <hi>own,</hi> and one <hi>anothers</hi> Welfare. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he <hi>designs</hi> that <hi>all</hi> should be happy, and in order thereunto, though he hath not actually <hi>made</hi> them so, yet hath fairly <hi>provided</hi> that all may be so; it is plain he hath left something to be done on <hi>our</hi> Part, and expects we should every one <hi>contribute</hi> what we are able towards eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>other</hi> Man's Happiness. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God places <hi>another's Happiness,</hi> or any Degree of it within the Power of <hi>my</hi>
                  <pb n="260" facs="tcp:34683:144"/>
                  <hi>Mercy;</hi> it is plain that it is with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, I should <hi>employ</hi> that <hi>Power</hi> to make him happy; and consequently that if I <hi>lavish</hi> out upon my own Pleasures and Conveniencies that <hi>Power</hi> to relieve the <hi>miserable,</hi> with which he hath entrusted me, and so permit them to <hi>continue</hi> miserable, I am an <hi>unfaithful</hi> Steward to <hi>his</hi> Trust, and <hi>responsible</hi> to him for all <hi>their</hi> Miseries. In short, since God by the eternal <hi>Bent</hi> and <hi>Inclination</hi> of his Nature aims at, and intends our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness; but yet hath put us into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>wherein</hi> without the <hi>Assistance</hi> of each others <hi>Mercy</hi> we cannot be tolerably happy; this is a plain Demonstration, that it is <hi>his Will</hi> we should <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>further</hi> his Intention, by being <hi>merciful</hi> to one another. Whilst therefore God permits <hi>Misery</hi> in one, that is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Reason why he should exact <hi>Mercy</hi> from another; since without that he can never obtain his <hi>End,</hi> which is the <hi>Happiness</hi> of <hi>all.</hi> For as since by the Laws of <hi>Generation</hi> he hath ordered all Men to come into the World <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>helpless,</hi> and <hi>unable</hi> to provide for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; he was bound in <hi>Goodness</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige their Parents by a <hi>natural</hi>

them, till they grow able to take Care for <hi>themselves,</hi> that so they might not be utterly <hi>abandoned:</hi> so since he hath thought good to <hi>expose</hi> us here to so many <hi>Miseries,</hi> and <hi>Calamities;</hi> he stood obliged, by the <hi>eternal Benignity</hi> of his Nature, to oblige us by all the Bowels of <hi>Mercy</hi> to <hi>succour</hi> and <hi>relieve</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till we are grown up to that <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of <hi>Happiness</hi> wherein we shall have no more need of Succour; that so at present we may not be left <hi>desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> and <hi>forlorn,</hi> but may find all that Relief in one another's <hi>Mercy,</hi> which is wanting to us in his <hi>immediate Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> For 'tis for <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> Ends that he permits us to be <hi>miserable</hi> here, to <hi>correct</hi> our Follies, and polish and <hi>cultivate</hi> our Nature, and <hi>train</hi> us up under a severe Discipline into a State of <hi>Everlasting Happiness;</hi> and therefore for the Redress of these <hi>Miseries,</hi> which for our <hi>Good</hi> he is fain to inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, it was <hi>necessary</hi> he should Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign us to the Protection of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>Mercy:</hi> that so this for the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> might be a Cordial to our <hi>Griefs,</hi> a Supply to our <hi>Wants,</hi> an Ease to our <hi>Oppressions,</hi> and a Sanctuary to our <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities;</hi> till <hi>Misery</hi> hath effected the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:34683:145"/>
gracious <hi>End</hi> she designed it for, and then he will <hi>release</hi> our <hi>Mercy</hi> from its Work, and permit it to enjoy an <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Sabbath.</hi> But so long as he thinks fit to <hi>continue</hi> us in this state of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery,</hi> his own <hi>Benignity</hi> will oblige <hi>him</hi> to oblige <hi>us</hi> to <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the <hi>mutual</hi> Exercise of our <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;</hi> that so being instead of <hi>Gods</hi> to one another, we may not be utterly <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned</hi> to Wretchedness; but by <hi>mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally succouring</hi> each other might all of us be tolerably happy: which we should all of us most certainly be, were we but so <hi>benign</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> to one another, as he <hi>expects</hi> and <hi>requires.</hi>

               </head>
               <p>GOD having made us <hi>free</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, and planted in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures an uncontroulable <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> of <hi>Choice;</hi> in Wisdom he hath so ordered and disposed things, that as we cannot be <hi>Miserable</hi> unless we <hi>will,</hi> so neither shall we be <hi>happy</hi> whether we <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>no.</hi> For as his <hi>Goodness</hi> would not suffer him to make us necessarily <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable,</hi> so neither would his <hi>Wisdom</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to entail our <hi>Happiness</hi> on our Natures, and make it inseparable to our Beings; for should he have done so, he must have altered the <hi>Laws</hi> of his own <hi>wise Creation,</hi> and made those Beings to act <hi>necessarily,</hi> which he made to act <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> For <hi>Happiness</hi> is the <hi>End</hi> of all our Actions; and therefore should God have made that <hi>necessary</hi> to us, he must have made us to act towards it with the same <hi>Necessity</hi> as inanimate Bodies do towards their proper Center; and consequently there would have been no such thing, as a <hi>free Agent</hi> in the lower World. That
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:34683:146"/>
we may always act therefore according to the Condition, and Frame of a <hi>free Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> the Foundations of all our <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Misery</hi> are laid in the <hi>right Use,</hi> or <hi>Abuse</hi> of our <hi>Liberty;</hi> and do imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately spring out of the <hi>Wisdom,</hi> or <hi>Folly</hi> of our own <hi>Choices:</hi> so that if we chuse <hi>wisely</hi> according to the Laws of <hi>Virtue</hi> and right <hi>Reason,</hi> we do thereby advance towards that <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> State we were created for: as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if we chuse <hi>foolishly</hi> according to the rash Counsels of our own <hi>vicious Appetites</hi> and <hi>sensual Inclinations,</hi> we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by sink our selves deeper and deeper to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Abyss of endless and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable <hi>Misery.</hi> For such is the Frame and Constitution of our <hi>Natures,</hi> that we cannot be <hi>good</hi> and <hi>miserable,</hi> nor <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>happy:</hi> and accordingly the Apostle sets before us the inevitable Fate of our own Actions, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 13. <hi>If ye live after the flesh, ye shall die; but if ye through the spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What these <hi>Deeds</hi> of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> or <hi>Body</hi> are, the Apostle telleth us, <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 19, 20, 21. <hi>The works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; adultery, fornication, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft,</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:34683:146"/>
                  <hi>hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, revellings, and such like; and they which do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> This is the <hi>Muster-roll</hi> of that formidable Army of Wickednesses, with which we are to engage, and which we must vanquish, or perish for ever. <hi>If ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live;</hi> i. e. if ye kill and destroy them, if ye wholly <hi>cease</hi> from them, both as to the <hi>outward</hi> Act of them, and the <hi>inward</hi> Appetite and Inclination towards them: For <hi>Mortification</hi> doth not only consist in a formal Abstinence from the <hi>outward</hi> Acts of Sin, or a superficial Skinning o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Orifice of its Wounds; but sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the very bottom of that putrid Core <hi>within,</hi> and eats out the <hi>inward Corruption,</hi> from whence those outward Blisters arise: It purges the <hi>Heart</hi> as well as the <hi>Hands,</hi> and drains those <hi>impure In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,</hi> which are the <hi>Springs</hi> of all Impiety and Wickedness.</p>
               <p>BUT to handle this Subject more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, I shall do these three things;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, SHEW wherein <hi>Mortification</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, WHAT are the Proper <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments</hi> of it.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:34683:147"/>Thirdly, WHAT are the most prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Motives</hi> to it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I. WHEREIN doth <hi>Mortification</hi> consist? I answer in these three Things. 1. In <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence</hi> from the <hi>outward</hi> Acts of Sin. 2. In not <hi>consenting</hi> unto <hi>any</hi> Sin. 3. In a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Endeavour</hi> to extinguish our <hi>involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> Sins.</p>
               <p>I. MORTIFICATION requires <hi>Abstinence</hi> from the <hi>outward</hi> Acts of Sin: For it is impossible that any Man should mortify his Lusts, while he indulges himself in the free <hi>Practice</hi> of them; because <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice</hi> is the Fuel that <hi>foments</hi> and <hi>feeds</hi> the inward vicious <hi>Inclinations,</hi> and both <hi>pampers</hi> and <hi>enrages</hi> the lustful <hi>Appetites</hi> of the Soul. For that <hi>Delight</hi> which we reap from acting our own Concupiscences, doth but <hi>increase</hi> and <hi>provoke</hi> them; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>natural</hi> to Men, when they have been <hi>pleased</hi> with any Action, to be more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently inclined to <hi>repeat</hi> it; the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> which they found in the former En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment <hi>provoking</hi> their Desires to enjoy it again. So that we may as well hope to put out a <hi>Fire</hi> by a continual feeding it with <hi>Fuel,</hi> and blowing it into <hi>Flame;</hi> as to mortify a <hi>Lust,</hi> whilst by our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <hi>practising</hi> it we <hi>nurse</hi> and <hi>cherish</hi> it, and do at once <hi>both feed</hi> and <hi>irritate</hi>
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:34683:147"/>
its Flames. If therefore we would ever <hi>mortify</hi> the Lusts of the Flesh, we must strictly <hi>restrain</hi> our selves from all <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Acts of them: For whilst we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge our selves in <hi>these,</hi> we feed our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, and pamper our bad <hi>Inclinations</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vicious <hi>Habits,</hi> and our vicious <hi>Habits</hi> into sinful <hi>Necessities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. MORTIFICATION consists in the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of our <hi>Wills</hi> from all <hi>sinful</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals. 'Tis no piece of <hi>Mortification</hi> for a Man to abstain only from the <hi>outward</hi> Acts of Sin, if in the mean time his <hi>Will</hi> is so far <hi>consenting</hi> to it, as that he would practise it, were it not for some inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening <hi>hindrances,</hi> or for <hi>want</hi> of a fair <hi>Opportunity.</hi> For in the Eye of <hi>God,</hi> to which our inmost <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Purposes</hi> are all open and unmasked, the <hi>Will</hi> to Sin is the <hi>Sin</hi> that is willed, though it should never proceed into <hi>Action:</hi> With Him it is <hi>acted</hi> as soon as it is <hi>conceived,</hi> and it is <hi>conceived</hi> as soon as ever it is thought of with <hi>Consent:</hi> It <hi>grows</hi> in the <hi>Delight</hi> we take in the <hi>Speculation</hi> of it, but is <hi>ripened</hi> in the Resolution of <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> it. For when once we are <hi>resolved</hi> upon it, our <hi>Heart</hi> hath done its utmost towards it; and so our <hi>consenting</hi> to it makes it <hi>perfect</hi> Sin, though it should
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:34683:148"/>
never break out into <hi>Action.</hi> So that 'tis Nonsense to talk of <hi>mortifying</hi> our Sin, while it hath the Consent of our <hi>Wills;</hi> for though it is more <hi>dangerous</hi> in the <hi>Action,</hi> and approaches nearer to a <hi>Habit,</hi> because the Consent <hi>continues</hi> all the while we commit it, and is <hi>confirmed</hi> by the <hi>Pleasure</hi> we reap in the Commission; yet still it is <hi>Sin,</hi> though it is only <hi>consented</hi> to; and it lives in the <hi>Purpose,</hi> though it breaths not out into the <hi>Practice.</hi> Our Enemy is not conquered, when it is only shut up within its Holds; and it doth but fortify it self <hi>within,</hi> while it wants Opportunities to sally out into <hi>Action.</hi> If we do not sin, only because we <hi>cannot,</hi> or because we want <hi>Opportunity,</hi> we are but <hi>Devils</hi> in <hi>Chains;</hi> and are never the less <hi>guilty,</hi> because we <hi>cannot</hi> do as much Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief as we <hi>would:</hi> For he that <hi>would</hi> sin if he <hi>could,</hi> hath sinned <hi>already</hi> as far as he is <hi>able;</hi> and so is every whit as <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi> in the Account of God, as he that doth sin when he <hi>can.</hi> The <hi>Mortification</hi> of our Lusts therefore doth necessarily imply the withdrawing the <hi>Consent</hi> of our <hi>Wills</hi> from them, and the final divorcing them from the Embraces of our <hi>Choice;</hi> for while they enjoy our <hi>Consent,</hi> they <hi>live</hi> in us, and <hi>rule</hi> us, though they should
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:34683:148"/>
never have the Opportunity to come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad into our Practice.</p>
               <p>III. MORTIFICATION consists in a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Endeavour</hi> to subdue our <hi>involuntary</hi> Appetites and Inclinations to sin. It is not sufficient that we do not <hi>practise</hi> sin, nor <hi>consent</hi> to the Practice of it; but we must make it our <hi>constant Endeavour</hi> to wean, and abstract ourselves from those <hi>evil Tendencies</hi> and <hi>Inclinations,</hi> which we have contracted by our former Sins: For though these <hi>Inclinations</hi> remaining in us are no farther our <hi>Sin,</hi> than we do <hi>yield</hi> and <hi>consent</hi> to them; yet while we pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently <hi>harbour</hi> them within our Bosoms, and do not honestly endeavour to <hi>smother</hi> and <hi>extinguish</hi> them, they are <hi>chosen</hi> and <hi>voluntary;</hi> and have the very <hi>Bane</hi> and <hi>Formality</hi> of Sin in them. Though we should be disabled from <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Adultery,</hi> yet while we retain with <hi>Delight</hi> our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations</hi> towards it, and quietly <hi>please</hi> our selves in the fantastick Joys of it; whilst we freely entertain its <hi>lewd</hi> and <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Ideas,</hi> and suffer them to walk to and fro upon the Stage of our <hi>Fancies</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Check</hi> or <hi>Controul;</hi> we are still <hi>adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous</hi> in the sight of <hi>God,</hi> to whom our Lust is as obvious within the <hi>Closet</hi> of our Minds, as upon the <hi>Theatre</hi> of our
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:34683:149"/>
Practice. We must not think therefore that our Sin is <hi>mortified,</hi> because we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>practise</hi> nor <hi>consent</hi> to the Practice of it; for while we have any <hi>Inclinations</hi> to sin remaining in us, we must endeavour to <hi>subdue</hi> and <hi>conquer</hi> them. If we do not, we have only forced our Enemy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his last Retreat, where by our own <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect</hi> we give him Opportunity to rally and reinforce himself against us: For our Sin still lives in our <hi>Inclination</hi> to sin, and will soon, if it be not beaten thence, recover its broken Forces, and grow as formidable as ever. 'Tis true, he that doth not <hi>consent</hi> to his own evil Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, but constantly <hi>denies</hi> them those <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Gratifications</hi> which they crave, taketh an infallible Course to <hi>starve</hi> and <hi>destroy</hi> them: For as <hi>these</hi> were first raised in us, and afterwards nourished into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by our vicious <hi>Practices;</hi> so by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to practise those Sins which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us to, and by practising the <hi>contrary Virtues,</hi> we shall by degrees <hi>abate</hi> the Strength and Vigour of them: And as <hi>they</hi> decay, so <hi>holy Inclinations</hi> will spring up in their room; which being <hi>heightened</hi> and made <hi>intense</hi> by a constant Practice of <hi>Holiness,</hi> will by degrees <hi>expel</hi> these our <hi>vicious Inclinations,</hi> and grow into
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:34683:149"/>
                  <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Habit.</hi> But meerly to abstain from the <hi>outward</hi> Acts of Sin, is a <hi>tedious</hi> way of mortifying our <hi>inward</hi> Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions towards it; for <hi>vicious Appetites</hi> will live a great while, even upon <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Gratifications.</hi> Though we should be <hi>drunk</hi> no more, yet if we indulge our selves the <hi>utmost Liberties</hi> of Sobriety, that will <hi>continue</hi> our Appetite to <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:</hi> Though we should abstain from all <hi>outward</hi> Acts of <hi>Lasciviousness,</hi> yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we <hi>deny</hi> our selves some of the <hi>lawful</hi> Pleasures of the Body, these will <hi>foment</hi> our wanton <hi>Inclinations:</hi> Though we should not suffer our <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Spight</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> to express themselves in any prohibited <hi>Actions;</hi> yet if we allow our selves even in <hi>lawful</hi> Anger, and <hi>just</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments of Injuries, this will for a great while <hi>preserve</hi> and keep <hi>alive</hi> our most black and devilish <hi>Propensions.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, this way of <hi>abstaining</hi> meerly from Sin will make the business of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification <hi>tedious,</hi> it is also full of <hi>Hazard</hi> and <hi>Difficulty:</hi> For he that only <hi>abstains</hi> from Sin, and <hi>gratifies</hi> his Inclinations as far as <hi>lawfully</hi> he may, is every moment in <hi>danger</hi> of exceeding the Line that parts the <hi>utmost</hi> of what is <hi>lawful</hi> from the <hi>nearmost</hi> of what is <hi>sinful.</hi> For <hi>Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:34683:150"/>
like all other Motions, is always <hi>swiftest</hi> when it is nearest its <hi>Center;</hi> and when once it is within the <hi>Reach</hi> and <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi> of its <hi>beloved</hi> Vice, then it hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries towards it with <hi>Fury</hi> and <hi>Impatience;</hi> insomuch that many times our <hi>Conscience</hi> proves too <hi>weak</hi> to stop the course of its <hi>impetuous</hi> Motions: And then when once it hath <hi>tasted</hi> the forbidden Pleasure of its Sin, it immediately <hi>recovers</hi> all its <hi>impaired Strength,</hi> and many times grows <hi>more fell</hi> and <hi>outragious</hi> than ever; and so the Ground we <hi>got</hi> in a Month's <hi>Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> from our Sin, we lose again in a Moment's <hi>Enjoying</hi> it; by which means the Work of <hi>Mortification</hi> becometh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly <hi>difficult</hi> and <hi>hazardous.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ever we mean to <hi>conquer</hi> our <hi>bad Inclinations,</hi> we must not only <hi>abstain</hi> from the <hi>Sins</hi> we are inclined to, but also from the <hi>Occasions</hi> of them. If it be <hi>Sensuality,</hi> we must starve it out by prudent <hi>Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Abstinence;</hi> if <hi>Devilishness,</hi> we must force it out by <hi>thwarting</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting</hi> it in the course of our Practice, and keep it at the greatest <hi>distance</hi> from it: For <hi>evil Inclinations</hi> are not to be mortifyed without <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> and like <hi>crooked</hi> Staves, the speediest way to make them <hi>strait,</hi> is to keep them bent

for a while the <hi>contrary</hi> way. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is implied in our honest <hi>Endeavour</hi> to <hi>mortify</hi> our <hi>involuntary Inclinations</hi> to sin, that we do not only forbear the <hi>sin</hi> it self, but avoid the <hi>Occasions</hi> that lead to it; and <hi>deny</hi> our selves those <hi>lawful</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, which do nearly approach it, and set us upon the brink of it. And thus you see wherein <hi>Mortification</hi> consists, namely in abstaining from the <hi>outward Act,</hi> and <hi>inward Consent</hi> to sin, and in a <hi>constant Endeavour</hi> to mortify those <hi>invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Inclinations</hi> to sin, which we have contracted in any former Course of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sinning.</p>

               <p>HAVING explained wherein <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> consists, I proceed in the next place to consider what are the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> of it: And these are chiefly these Six;</p>

               </list>
               <p>I. FAITH, or a thorough <hi>Belief</hi> of the Truth of our <hi>Religion;</hi> which will furnish us with such <hi>Arguments</hi> against our <hi>Lusts,</hi> as all the <hi>Temptations</hi> they can muster up will never be able to <hi>resist.</hi> Hence St. <hi>Iohn</hi> tells us, that <hi>This is the victory that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the world, even our faith.</hi> 1 Epist. v. 4. where by the <hi>World</hi> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand all those <hi>Temptations</hi> to sin, that do arise from these outward worldly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects wherewithal we are here surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Faith</hi> therefore must needs be a mighty <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>mortifying</hi> our Sins, it being the <hi>Victory</hi> whereby we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all the <hi>Temptations</hi> to them: And indeed a firm <hi>Belief</hi> of the mighty Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Christianity</hi> is in it self such an <hi>efficacious Means</hi> to dissuade us from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that one would think it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for the most <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>resolute</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to <hi>withstand</hi> it. For who but a <hi>mad</hi> Man would prostitute himself to the <hi>Charms</hi> and <hi>Flatteries</hi> of a base <hi>Lust,</hi> that
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:34683:151"/>
believes that <hi>Promise</hi> which proposes a Heaven of <hi>immortal Ioys</hi> to dissuade him from it? Who would be <hi>frighted</hi> into any Sin by the most amazing <hi>Danger</hi> that can threaten, or befal him, that credits that <hi>Threat</hi> which denounces a Hell of <hi>endless</hi> and <hi>intolerable Woes</hi> against every wilful Transgression? Did we but <hi>believe,</hi> that it cost the Son of God his dearest Blood to <hi>redeem</hi> us from our Sins; How could we be so <hi>disingenuous</hi> to our best <hi>Friend,</hi> as to <hi>harbour</hi> those Lusts that were <hi>his Murderers,</hi> and which he <hi>abhors</hi> more than the <hi>Spear</hi> that pierced his Side, or the <hi>Nails</hi> that gored his Hands and Feet? Yea, how could we be so <hi>fool-hardy</hi> as to <hi>dally</hi> with those Sins, which are so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>odious</hi> unto <hi>God,</hi> that he would not be <hi>attoned</hi> for them by any <hi>meaner</hi> Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice than the <hi>Blood</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> Son? In a word, did we but <hi>believe,</hi> that we must all <hi>appear</hi> before the Judgment-Seat of Christ, to give a <hi>strict Account</hi> for whatsoever we have done in the Flesh; What <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> could there be great enough to ballance our Fear of that <hi>dreadful</hi> Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal? Doubtless, did we but heartily <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> our Holy <hi>Religion,</hi> there is nothing in all the World would be so <hi>terrible</hi> as <hi>Sin</hi> to us; the mighty Arguments of the
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:34683:152"/>
                  <hi>Gospel</hi> would so <hi>over-awe</hi> us, that we should not be able to think of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Horrour</hi> and <hi>Amazement;</hi> the very <hi>Sight</hi> of it would scare us like an <hi>Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition,</hi> and cause us to run away from it in as great a <hi>Fright,</hi> as if the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self were at our heels. For, Lord! can I be so stupid, as to hug my <hi>Lusts,</hi> while I <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> that I shall rue for it to all <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</hi> Can I be so sensless of my own <hi>Interest,</hi> as to treat and entertain those <hi>Vices,</hi> which I verily <hi>believe</hi> will rob me of all that an <hi>everlasting Heaven</hi> means? No, no; Did I but <hi>believe</hi> the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> doubtless I should sooner trust my <hi>Body</hi> among ravenous <hi>Cannibals,</hi> than my <hi>Soul</hi> among my <hi>Sins;</hi> and think my self much safer among <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> and <hi>Scorpions,</hi> than in the Embraces of my <hi>Lusts;</hi> which whilst they wrap themselves in <hi>amorous</hi> Folds about me, <hi>sting</hi> me with an <hi>everlasting Venom.</hi> But our Misery is, that we are most of <hi>us Christians</hi> by <hi>chance;</hi> and have taken up our <hi>Religion</hi> upon <hi>trust,</hi> without ever sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying our selves of its <hi>Credibility,</hi> or troubling our selves to enquire <hi>why</hi> or <hi>wherefore,</hi> we profess it: So that though perhaps we do not absolutely <hi>disbelieve,</hi> yet neither can we be properly said to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:34683:152"/>
it; it being a matter we never troubled our selves about, so as to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi> whether it be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false;</hi> and therefore it is no great wonder, that it hath so <hi>little Effect</hi> upon us. For how can it be expected, that we should be <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected</hi> with that which we do not <hi>believe;</hi> or be persuaded to part with those <hi>Lusts</hi> that are so <hi>dear</hi> to us, upon <hi>Proposals</hi> that we give <hi>no Credit</hi> to, and of whose <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falshood</hi> we never troubled our selves to <hi>enquire?</hi> Let us therefore but satisfy our own <hi>Reason</hi> of the Truth of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> by considering impartially those mighty <hi>Evidences</hi> it is founded upon; and then it will soon captivate our Souls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> of it; and none of our <hi>Lusts</hi> will be able to withstand its mighty <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Efficacy,</hi> but will all be <hi>forced</hi> to fall down before it, as <hi>Dagon</hi> did before the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>Lord.</hi> This therefore is the first <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> viz. a hearty <hi>Belief</hi> of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. ANOTHER <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is <hi>Consideration.</hi> For we have no other way to mortify our <hi>Lusts,</hi> but only by <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Argument,</hi> and 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that any Arguments should persuade us, unless we duly <hi>consider</hi> the Strength
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:34683:153"/>
and Force of them. 'Tis true, our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> furnishes us with sufficient Arguments to baffle all the <hi>Temptations</hi> of Sin; But what will it signify to have good Arguments in our <hi>Bibles,</hi> while they are out of our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and are not at all <hi>regarded</hi> by us? Do we expect they should cure our <hi>Souls,</hi> as Charms and Amulets do our <hi>Bodies,</hi> meerly by being written upon Paper, and worn in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms? Why then may they not as well charm a <hi>Swine</hi> into Cleanliness, or a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage <hi>Tyger</hi> out of his natural Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Cruelty? But alas! all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments in the World to an <hi>inconsiderate</hi> Mind, are but like so many Arrows shot against an <hi>Anvil,</hi> where they cannot stick but are forced to rebound and fly off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain without making any <hi>Impression</hi> on it. And hence in the Parable of the <hi>Seed,</hi> the reason which our Saviour assigns why it prospered not in the <hi>High-way,</hi> the <hi>stony,</hi> and <hi>thorny</hi> Ground, was either that they <hi>considered</hi> not <hi>at all,</hi> or not <hi>enough,</hi> Matth. xiii. 19, 20, 21, 22. either they were <hi>wholly inconsiderate,</hi> so that the Seed of God's Word lay scattered upon the surface of their Minds, like Corn upon the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to be <hi>picked,</hi> and <hi>devoured</hi> by the Fowls of the Air; or they <hi>considered</hi> but
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:34683:153"/>
a <hi>little,</hi> so that the Divine Seed being not throughly rooted in them, produced only a present Fit, and pang of Religion, which in the Heat of the next Temptation <hi>wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered</hi> and <hi>died</hi> away; or else they <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered</hi> but by <hi>halves,</hi> their Minds being all over-grown with worldly Cares and Thoughts, which quickly choked that Holy Seed, and rendered it <hi>barren</hi> and <hi>unfruitful.</hi> Thus <hi>Inconsideration,</hi> you see, will render the most <hi>powerful</hi> Motives <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>significant;</hi> and it will be to no purpose for <hi>Religion</hi> to knock at the door of our Souls, while our Reason is <hi>asleep,</hi> and our Understandings <hi>deaf</hi> to its Importunities. But would we be but so true to our own Interest, as to inure our selves to a through <hi>Consideration</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> that would arm us with such <hi>invincible</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as none of our Lusts would be able to withstand; and we should have so many good Thoughts, like <hi>Guardian Angels,</hi> perpetually encamped about us, that whensoever the <hi>Devil</hi> or the <hi>World</hi> besieged us, they would find our Souls <hi>impregnably</hi> fortified against all their Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries. If in the Morning, before we go into the World, we would sit down a while, and take a little pains to <hi>antidote</hi> our Souls with such Thoughts as these;
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:34683:154"/>
                  <hi>O my Soul! now am I going into the midst of a crowd of temptations, where ever and anon one bad Object or other will be beckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, and inviting me unto that which is evil; let us therefore consider a little what answer we shall return to all their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities: By and by perhaps some great opportunity of gain may present it self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, to tempt thee to a fraud or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senage; but alas! What a poor recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence will a little Money be for all that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of misery, whereunto I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign my self by it? Can I carry this sorry Pelf thither with me? Or if I could, can I bribe my Flames, or corrupt my Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors with it? And shall I for such a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling momentary Gain, incur such an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Damage? When I have thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered this Temptation, perhaps immediately after some amorous Object may present it self, to court me to the Harlot's Bed; but O my Soul! Will the Pleasures I am promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed there compensate the loss of all that Heaven of immortal Ioys, which I shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit by it? And if they will not, as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they will not, shall I be so childish, as for the Pleasures of a moment to extinguish all my hope of being pleased for ever? And when thou hast thus baffled this Temptation, perhaps thou mayst be solicited a new with</hi>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:34683:154"/>
                  <hi>some importunate invitation to Intemperance; but O my Soul! Remember the bitter Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that thy Saviour endured upon the Score of thy Sins; how this among the rest filled his deadly Cup, and vomited it full of Gall and Vinegar; and can I be so sensless as to make light of any sin, the guilt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was so heavy as to crush the Lord of Life into his Grave? Shall I be so disinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous as to gratifie any Lust, that had a hand in the murder of my dearest Saviour, my Saviour who loveth me a thousand times better than I love my self? And now no sooner hast thou repulsed this temptation, but happily some other may assault thee; thou mayst be presented with a favourable oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of treating thy Lusts so privatly and securely, as that no Eye shall discover thee; and then how difficult will it be for thee to refuse such an inviting Occasion: but consider O my Soul! thou art always and every where under the inspection of thy Iudg, by whose righteous Doom thou must stand or fall for ever; and he that seeth what thou dost in private will one day call thee to account, and openly unmask all thy actions, and present them bare-faced upon the publick Theatre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the world of Spirits; unless there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou couldst find a place to be wicked in where God might not see thee, 'tis in vain</hi>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:34683:155"/>
                  <hi>to promise thy self coverts and retirements; for he will one day bring to light all thy deeds of Darkness, and display thy shame to the open view of the world:</hi> would we, I say, but take the pains every Morning, before we enter into the World, to <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>antidote</hi> our Souls with such <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations</hi> as these, it would doubtless mightily contribute to the <hi>Mortification</hi> of our Lusts. For this would make the Arguments of our Religion so <hi>familiar</hi> to us, that no <hi>Temptations</hi> whatsoever would be able to baffle our <hi>Resolutions;</hi> which being backed with such a Strength of <hi>Reason,</hi> would stand like a Rock of <hi>Adamant,</hi> outbraving the Fury of those Waves that dash themselves against it, and forcing them to retire after all their threatning Rage in empty and insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Foams. For what <hi>Temptation</hi> can be too hard for that Soul, that is armed with the Hope of <hi>Heaven</hi> and the Fear of <hi>Hell;</hi> and is furnished with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from all the Quarters of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> to oppose against it? This therefore is another of those <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments,</hi> by which we are to <hi>Mortifie</hi> our Lusts; <hi>viz.</hi> a serious Consideration of the <hi>Motives</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> whereby we are to oppose them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:34683:155"/>III. ANOTHER <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is a hearty and well-grounded <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> and indeed without a <hi>firm Resolution</hi> it is in vain for us to attempt the <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> of our Lusts, or any <hi>difficult</hi> Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking whatsoever. For there is a wide Distance between <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Things,</hi> and 'tis much easier to <hi>discourse</hi> of Things than to pass them into <hi>Execution:</hi> for <hi>clear Reasonings</hi> are accompanied with a wonderful Delight, because there we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage only with <hi>Designs;</hi> and fighting only with the <hi>Idea's</hi> of Things, they will easily suffer themselves to be conquered by us, and taken Captive at our Will: but when we pass into <hi>Practice,</hi> that will revolt and oppose us in the <hi>Execution,</hi> which was so very compliant in the <hi>Thought</hi> and <hi>Meditation;</hi> then you will find that you must <hi>wrestle</hi> stoutly with those <hi>Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> that will make Head against you, and that these will put you to a <hi>greater</hi> Proof of your <hi>Valour</hi> and <hi>Constancy</hi> than ever you did imagin; so that unless you are armed with a great Strength of <hi>Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi> you will be beaten oft at the first Attempt, and meeting with greater <hi>Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> than you expected, be forced upon a base and Cowardly <hi>Retreat.</hi> Now to form a firm <hi>Resolution</hi> requires a great deal
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:34683:156"/>
of <hi>Prudence</hi> and good <hi>Conduct;</hi> for it is of great avail in all Cases to <hi>begin well;</hi> and as a Foundation well laid doth se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Superstructure, so a <hi>Resolution</hi> well formed will render the <hi>Execution</hi> of what we are to do a great deal more easie and feasible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Before we do resolve therefore on <hi>mortifying</hi> our <hi>Lusts,</hi> let us be sure to make use of the former <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification;</hi> that is, let us acquaint our selves with all those mighty Arguments against sin, wherewith either our <hi>Reason</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> can furnish us; and let us consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them over and over, till they are <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar</hi> to our Understandings, and our <hi>Thoughts</hi> have extracted the <hi>utmost Force</hi> of them: for which End it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for us to seek Direction from our <hi>Spiritual Guides.</hi> Then let us seriously consider with our selves, <hi>what</hi> it is that we are about to do, what <hi>Vices</hi> we must divorce, and what <hi>Vertues</hi> we must e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spouse; and let us throughly inform our selves before-hand of all the foul <hi>Ways,</hi> and steep <hi>Ascents,</hi> and dangerous <hi>Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices</hi> that are in the Road of our Duty: and then as you go along in your Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, ask your own Hearts whether there be any Passage that they <hi>startle</hi> at, or whether notwithstanding all, they are
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:34683:156"/>
                  <hi>seriously willing</hi> you should go on? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate to your own Souls, that in such a place your <hi>Lust</hi> will be tempting you with the Genial Pleasures of an <hi>adulterous Bed,</hi> and desire them to deal <hi>plainly</hi> with you whether they can be deaf to those <hi>bewitching Invitations;</hi> tell them that before you have gone ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Paces farther, the Wants of <hi>poorer Men</hi> than your selves will be soliciting your <hi>Charity,</hi> and desire to know of them whether they are willing you should <hi>do good</hi> and <hi>trust God</hi> for a Repayment; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to them how highly you may be <hi>provoked</hi> at the next step by the <hi>injurious</hi> Carriage of some insolent <hi>Adversary,</hi> and know of them whether they are willing to <hi>contain</hi> their savage <hi>Passions</hi> within the bars of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Sobriety:</hi> and so go on in your own <hi>Thoughts</hi> through all the Paths of your <hi>Duty,</hi> and never cease put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting these and such like <hi>Questions</hi> distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to your own Souls, till they give an <hi>express Consent</hi> to every <hi>Duty</hi> that presses for a Resolution. And it will very much conduce to the settling of a <hi>fixed Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in you, if you do not conclude too <hi>soon,</hi> but <hi>weigh</hi> all these things over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; if you would ask your selves the next Morning, whether you still <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:34683:157"/>
of the same Mind, and whether your former <hi>Consent</hi> was not the effect of a <hi>present Heat,</hi> or whether now after the cool of the Night you do <hi>still allow</hi> of it; for in all probability if you <hi>resolve</hi> in hast, you will <hi>repent</hi> at leisure. And this, I doubt not, is the Bane of most of our good <hi>Resolutions,</hi> that generally they are the Effects of some <hi>transitory Passion,</hi> and not of a <hi>sober Iudgment</hi> and <hi>serious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation:</hi> for when Men resolve well in Heats of <hi>Passion,</hi> they resolve to do they know not what themselves, but swallow their Religion by the <hi>Lump,</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the <hi>Particulars</hi> of it; and so they do by their <hi>Duty,</hi> as Men do with bitter <hi>Pills,</hi> which they can swallow <hi>whole,</hi> but when they come to <hi>chew,</hi> those prove so distastful, that presently they spit them out again. When therefore you have calmly <hi>considered</hi> with your selves all the <hi>Arguments</hi> against your Sins, and all the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of forsaking them, and you have <hi>reason'd</hi> your Wills into an <hi>express Consent</hi> to part with them for ever: then betake your selves to your bended Knees, and in the most solemn manner devote your selves unto God: <hi>O Lord, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, I have been a great Offender against thee; and that my past life has been nothing</hi>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:34683:157"/>
                  <hi>else but a continued Rebellion; but now I see my folly, and am ashamed to think what a notorious Offender I have been; wherefore here I solemnly promise in thy dreadful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and in the presence of all thy holy Angels, that wherever I have done amiss, I will do so no more: be witness, O thou Righteous Iudg of the World, that here I shake hands with all my darling Lusts, and bid them adieu for ever: wherefore be gone ye Soul-destroying Vipers, that have twined so long about me; away, ye wretched Idols, whom I have too long adored; for in the name of God I am fully resolved never to entertain you more.</hi> And now having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced our selves to a <hi>good Resolution</hi> of Mind, our greatest Difficulty is over: for so long as we keep our <hi>Resolution,</hi> we are <hi>invincible,</hi> and all the Powers of <hi>Hell</hi> will not be able to <hi>prevail</hi> against us. For our Wills are not to be <hi>forced</hi> by any Power whatsoever; and there is no <hi>Temptation</hi> in the World can make us <hi>return</hi> to our <hi>Sin,</hi> so long as we are heartily <hi>resolved</hi> against it: so that all we have now to do is to keep the ground we have gotten, and not to suffer our <hi>Spiritual Enemies</hi> to batter down those <hi>good Resolutions</hi> we have raised against them, which if we can but maintain will
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:34683:158"/>
infallibly secure us against all their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Malice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. ANOTHER <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is a wise and prudent <hi>Discipline.</hi> When by <hi>Consideration</hi> we have brought our selves to a thorough <hi>Resolution</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, then to <hi>confirm</hi> and <hi>secure</hi> our Resolution, there are sundry wise and prudent <hi>Methods</hi> to be used: as First, a frequent <hi>Repetition</hi> and <hi>Renewal</hi> of it. For at first our <hi>vicious Inclinations</hi> will muster up all their Strength against our <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and a <hi>perpetual Contest</hi> there will be between them, till either the one or the other is <hi>subdued:</hi> but our good <hi>Resolution</hi> being yet but <hi>raw</hi> and <hi>infirm,</hi> will ever and anon be apt to <hi>flinch</hi> and <hi>retreat;</hi> so that unless we often <hi>renew</hi> and <hi>reinforce</hi> it, it will not long be able to withstand the Assaults and Importunities of our <hi>vicious Inclinations.</hi> Wherefore if we mean to be <hi>successful</hi> in this Work of <hi>Mortification,</hi> it will be necessary for some time at least till the Strength of our <hi>bad Inclinations</hi> is broken, that we should every Morning before we go abroad into the World <hi>renew</hi> our <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Resolutions</hi> of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and <hi>reinforce</hi> them with a <hi>serious Consideration</hi> of those great Arguments whereupon they were first founded; that
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:34683:158"/>
we should go out of our Chambers <hi>armed</hi> as Men that wait for their Enemies, and not <hi>trust</hi> our own Souls among the <hi>Temptations</hi> of the World, till we have first <hi>chained</hi> up our Inclinations with <hi>new Vows</hi> of Fidelity. Let us therefore every day as soon as we open our Eyes thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve with our selves; <hi>I am now going into a world of Temptations, where I shall be solicited both from within and without to falsifie my Vows which I have made to my God, and to betray my own Soul into everlasting Perdition: wherefore I do here in the dreadful presence of God, and of my Saviour, and of all the heavenly Host re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and ratifie again the good Resolutions I have made, without any reservation or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; and whatsoever Invitations I may have to the contrary, I will never revoke this promise which I now make, or any part of it: so help me, O my God.</hi> And if for a while we would but <hi>use</hi> our selves to this <hi>Method,</hi> I doubt not but we should quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly find our good <hi>Resolutions</hi> so <hi>strengthened</hi> and <hi>confirmed,</hi> that the Gates of Hell would not be able to <hi>prevail</hi> against them: but if when we have made a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution</hi> against our sins, we do not take care to <hi>confirm</hi> and <hi>renew</hi> it, we shall find the <hi>Strength</hi> of it will by degrees so <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay</hi> and <hi>abate,</hi> that at last it will be <hi>foil'd</hi>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:34683:159"/>
and <hi>baffled</hi> by every Temptation that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters it. This therefore is <hi>one</hi> Part of that wise and prudent <hi>Discipline</hi> we are to exercise over our selves, when we are throughly resolved against our sin, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to <hi>renew</hi> our Resolution.</p>
               <p>II. ANOTHER Part of it is frequent <hi>Reflection</hi> upon and <hi>Examination</hi> of our selves. And indeed if we do not <hi>inure</hi> our selves to <hi>this,</hi> we shall very often sin <hi>unawares</hi> without either <hi>considering</hi> what we are <hi>doing,</hi> or <hi>reflecting</hi> upon what we have <hi>done:</hi> and while we can thus sin without <hi>Check</hi> or <hi>Controul,</hi> it will be in <hi>vain</hi> for us to make <hi>Resolutions</hi> of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For still the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of <hi>one</hi> Act will invite us to <hi>another,</hi> and so in the hurry of our worldly Occasions, we shall go on to <hi>repeat</hi> sin after sin, without <hi>heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> what we do, or <hi>repenting</hi> of what we have done: and if we suffer <hi>one</hi> sin to break through the Fence, that will open a gap for <hi>others</hi> to follow; and if <hi>these</hi> are not presently <hi>stopp'd</hi> by serious <hi>Reflection,</hi> they will make the Breach yet wider for <hi>others;</hi> till at last they have trodden down all the <hi>Enclosures</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and laid open our whole Souls into a <hi>Common,</hi> and <hi>Throughfare</hi> of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But now by <hi>inuring</hi> our selves to a frequent <hi>Reflection</hi> upon and <hi>Examination</hi>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:34683:159"/>
of our own Actions, we shall in a great measure prevent those many <hi>Surprizes</hi> which otherwise will be unavoidable to us: and when at any time we stumble at unawares, the <hi>Penance</hi> we shall undergo in reflecting upon our fault will so <hi>embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of it, as to render it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of seducing us again. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to secure the <hi>Mortification</hi> of our sins, as it is necessary that every Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we should <hi>renew</hi> our Resolution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, so it is no less requisite that every Night (especially till we have made some considerable Progress) we should seriously examin our <hi>Performances,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have comported with our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions;</hi> and if upon an <hi>impartial</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of our own Actions we find that they <hi>have,</hi> let us lie down in Peace, blessing and adoring that <hi>Grace</hi> by which we have been preserved. But if we are conscious to our selves of any <hi>Breach</hi> that we have made upon our <hi>Morning Vows</hi> of Obedience, let us bitterly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail our own <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Baseness,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon it with the greatest Shame and Indignation: <hi>What have I done, O wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Traitor that I am, both to God and my own Soul? I have mocked the great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of Heaven, with solemn vows of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and broke the most sacred Ties to</hi>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:34683:160"/>
                  <hi>come at those Lusts which will be my ruin: what can I plead for my self, Base and Unworthy that I am? With what face can I go into his dreadful presence, whom I so lately invoked to be Witness to those Vows which I have this day falsified? Yet go I will, though I am all ashamed and confounded, and confess and bewail mine Iniquity before him.</hi> And if we would but keep our selves a while to this strict <hi>Discipline,</hi> we cannot imagin how mightily it would contribute to the <hi>Mortification</hi> of our Lusts: it would make our Reason so <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant,</hi> and our Conscience so <hi>tender,</hi> that in a little while we should be startled with every <hi>Appearance of Evil;</hi> and <hi>Death</hi> it self would not be so terrible, as <hi>Sin</hi> to to us; the <hi>Pleasure</hi> of our sin would be so allayed and abated by those <hi>stinging Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections</hi> that would follow it upon, that it would be no longer capable of <hi>alluring</hi> and <hi>seducing</hi> us; and the dread of that bitter <hi>Penance,</hi> which we must undergo at Night, would sufficiently secure us against the <hi>Temptations</hi> of the Day.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and Lastly, ANOTHER Part of that prudent <hi>Discipline</hi> which we are to exercise upon our selves, is to keep our selves at as great a <hi>distance</hi> from Sin, as <hi>prudently</hi> and <hi>conveniently</hi> we can. He that will <hi>mortifie</hi> his Sin, must at first
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:34683:160"/>
not only <hi>abstain</hi> from <hi>sinning,</hi> but also from every thing that doth nearly <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach</hi> and <hi>border</hi> upon it: as for instance, it is not sufficient to <hi>mortifie</hi> an intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate <hi>Appetite,</hi> that we abstain from <hi>Drunkenness</hi> and <hi>Gluttony;</hi> but besides this, we must for a while at least be very <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemious,</hi> till we have <hi>reduced</hi> our Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite from its wild <hi>Exorbitances,</hi> and not <hi>indulge</hi> to our selves the utmost Liberties of <hi>lawful</hi> Eating and Drinking: it is not sufficient for the <hi>subduing</hi> our wanton <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations,</hi> that we abstain from <hi>Adultery</hi> and <hi>Fornication;</hi> but we must also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear those <hi>Meats</hi> and <hi>Drinks,</hi> those <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures</hi> and <hi>Societies,</hi> those <hi>Sights</hi> and <hi>Sports</hi> which are apt to administer <hi>Fuel</hi> to our <hi>immodest Flames:</hi> to <hi>tame</hi> our ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and revengful <hi>Passions,</hi> it is not enough that we abstain from all <hi>unjust Retaliations</hi> of Injuries; but we must more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over restrain our selves even from that <hi>lawful</hi> Displeasure and <hi>just</hi> Resentment, which may safely be allowed to a meek and charitable Disposition. And under these strict <hi>Restraints</hi> we must keep our selves for a while, till we have <hi>worn</hi> off our evil <hi>Inclinations,</hi> by <hi>habituating</hi> our selves to the contrary <hi>Vertues:</hi> and then we may safely <hi>unloose</hi> our Bands, and return again, to our <hi>lawful</hi> Freedoms. But
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:34683:161"/>
if while we are <hi>strongly inclined</hi> to any sin, we will venture as <hi>near</hi> to it as <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> we may, it is a mighty <hi>Hazard</hi> but our <hi>Inclination</hi> will carry us a great deal <hi>farther</hi> than we should go. For generally the Transition out of the <hi>utmost</hi> of what is <hi>lawful</hi> into the <hi>nearmost</hi> of what is <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> is undiscernable; the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Line</hi> that metes out a <hi>Vertue</hi> form its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Vice</hi> being commonly so <hi>small,</hi> that it is hard to <hi>distinguish</hi> where they part, or to find out the just <hi>Boundary</hi> whereto we may go and <hi>no farther:</hi> so that when we think we are only upon the Extremities of what is <hi>lawful,</hi> we are many times passed the Line, and are far gone within the Borders of what is <hi>sinful.</hi> So that unless we had an <hi>infallible Guide</hi> to accompany us in all our Actions and Circumstances, and to point out to us the particular <hi>Limits</hi> of <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful;</hi> it is impossible we should be safe within the <hi>Neighbourhood</hi> of Evil: but like those who dwell upon the <hi>Confines</hi> of two hostile Countries, we shall still lie open to <hi>Invasion</hi> on every side. For our bad Inclinations are never so <hi>impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> of <hi>Restraint,</hi> as when they are within <hi>Prospect</hi> of <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and the objects which attract them are <hi>near</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> to be enjoy'd: now they will <hi>struggle</hi> with
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:34683:161"/>
all their <hi>Might</hi> against our Resolution, and taking a <hi>new scent</hi> of those beloved Lusts whose alluring Relishes they had almost forgotten, with all the ties of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> we shall hardly be <hi>able</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them from following the <hi>beloved Game.</hi> So that unless we keep our selves at a convenient <hi>Distance</hi> from <hi>sin,</hi> our bad <hi>Inclinations</hi> will be always within <hi>View</hi> of Temptation; which the <hi>nearer</hi> it is, the more it will <hi>court</hi> and <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune</hi> them: and while we keep <hi>near</hi> our sin, and do not enjoy it, we do but <hi>tantalize</hi> our selves, and <hi>enrage</hi> our own Hunger by keeing a <hi>Bait</hi> before us which we <hi>dare</hi> not swallow. If ever therefore we mean to <hi>mortifie</hi> our <hi>Lusts,</hi> we must not only avoid <hi>coming</hi> at them, but so far as we can, <hi>approaching</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; at least till we have so <hi>weaned</hi> our Inclination from them, that their <hi>Nearness</hi> ceases to be a <hi>Temptation</hi> to us. These are the Parts of that wise and prudent <hi>Discipline,</hi> which we are to exercise upon our selves, as a <hi>Mean</hi> and <hi>Instrument</hi> to <hi>mortifie</hi> our Lusts.</p>
               <p>V. ANOTHER <hi>Instrument</hi> of <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is frequent Receiving of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> And indeed I do not know any
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:34683:162"/>
one more effectual <hi>Cause,</hi> or more fatal <hi>Symptom</hi> of the <hi>Decay</hi> of <hi>Christian Piety</hi> among us, than is the common and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Neglect of this <hi>solemn Ordinance,</hi> which were it but <hi>frequented</hi> with that <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>due</hi> Preparation that it ought to be, would doubtless be highly <hi>instrumental</hi> to <hi>reform</hi> the World, and to make Men <hi>good</hi> in good earnest. For besides that those sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Elements are by <hi>God's Institution</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>moral</hi> Conveyances of the <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> whereby our good Resolutions are <hi>nourish'd</hi> and <hi>confirm'd;</hi> there we have represented openly to our <hi>Senses</hi> one of the greatest Arguments against Sin in all our Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of our blessed Saviour: There he is represented to my Eyes in all his <hi>Wounds</hi> and <hi>Agonies,</hi> bruised and broken for my Sin, and bleeding to expiate my Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions. And, <hi>O my obdurate Soul, canst thou behold this tragical Spectacle, without Indignation against thy Sins which were the Cause of it? Does not thy Heart rise against thy Sins, whilst thou here beholdest him wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering in his Blood, and hearest those gaping Wounds it issueth from proclaiming them his Assassines and Murderers? But if thou hast not Ingenuity enough to prompt thee to revenge thy Saviour's quarrel upon these</hi>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:34683:162"/>
                  <hi>his mortal Enemies, yet methinks Self-love would move thee not to be fond of thy Sins, when thou here beholdest how much the Son of God endured to expiate them. For how canst thou think of sinning without Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and Astonishment, who hast here before thine Eyes such a dreadful Example of God's Severity against it? Does it not strike thy Soul into an Agony to behold this bloody Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, wherein the all-merciful Father is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented so inexorably incensed against thy Sins, that he that was the most innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that ever was upon Earth, and also the greatest Favourite that ever was in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, could not with all his Prayers and Tears obtain thy Pardon, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going for thee the bitter Agonies of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Death? Sure if thou hast any one Spark of Love in thee either towards thy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or thy self, this solemn Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Passion cannot but affect thee with Horror and Indignation against thy Sins.</hi> But then as in this great Solemnity we do <hi>commemorate</hi> our Saviour's Passion, so we do also <hi>renew</hi> the <hi>Vows</hi> of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him; which (as I have shewed you) is very <hi>instrumental</hi> in it self to the subduing of our sins; but much more, when it is done in so <hi>sacred</hi> a manner. For as Feasting upon Sacrifices was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:34683:163"/>
used as a <hi>federal</hi> Rite, both among the <hi>Iews,</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> whereby God and Men by <hi>eating</hi> together did <hi>mutually</hi> oblige themselves to one another; so the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> being a Feast upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of Christ's Body and Blood, when we come thither we <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> of his Sacrifice, and do thereby <hi>devote</hi> our selves in the most solemn manner to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: We swear <hi>Allegiance</hi> to him upon his own Body and Blood, and take the <hi>Sacrament</hi> upon it, that we will be his <hi>faithful Votaries.</hi> When we take the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated Symbols into our hands, we make this solemn <hi>Dedication</hi> of our selves to God; <hi>Here we offer and present unto thee, O Lord, our selves, our Souls and Bodies to be a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable holy and lively sacrifice unto thee, and here we call to witness this sacred Blood that redeemed us, and those vocal Wounds that interceded for us, that from henceforth we oblige our selves never to start from thy service, what Difficulties soever we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter in it, and what Temptations soever we may have to forsake it.</hi> Now what can be a greater <hi>Restraint</hi> to us, when we are solicited to any Evil, than such a <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn</hi> and <hi>sacred</hi> Obligation? Methinks the Sense of that <hi>dreadful Vow</hi> that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, should so over-awe us, that we
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:34683:163"/>
should not be able to <hi>think</hi> of <hi>sinning</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Horror: <hi>For, Lord! how shall I dare to cheat and defraud my Neighbour, when 'twas but the other day that I vowed to be honest, and took the Sacrament upon it! with what Conscience can I now hate or design revenge against my Brother, when I so lately swore unto God upon the Body and Blood of my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, that I would love and forgive all the world!</hi> Surely if Men had any Sense of <hi>God,</hi> any Dram of <hi>Religion</hi> in them, they would not be able after such <hi>engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to <hi>look</hi> upon any Temptation to sin without <hi>Trembling:</hi> And whatsoever Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of <hi>Unworthiness</hi> Men may make to keep themselves from this <hi>Ordinance,</hi> I doubt not but the great <hi>Reason</hi> of their Neglect is this, that they love their <hi>Lusts,</hi> and are resolved whatsoever comes of it they will not part with them; and so they will not <hi>come</hi> to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they must be obliged to <hi>renounce</hi> their <hi>Lusts</hi> there, which they are extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unwilling to do. And if this be their <hi>Reason,</hi> as I fear it is, they are <hi>unworthy</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the more Shame for them; but it is such an <hi>Unworthiness</hi> as is so far from <hi>excusing</hi> their Neglect, that it is a foul <hi>Aggravation</hi> of it: For he that will not <hi>receive</hi> the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> because he will not
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:34683:164"/>
                  <hi>renounce</hi> his <hi>Lusts,</hi> makes <hi>one</hi> Sin the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of <hi>another,</hi> and so pleads that for his <hi>Excuse</hi> which will be the Cause of his <hi>Condemnation.</hi> But if we are honestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to <hi>part</hi> with all our Sins, and can but willingly <hi>devote</hi> them as Sacrifices to the <hi>Altar,</hi> we are sufficiently <hi>prepared</hi> for this great Solemnity, and shall be <hi>welcome Guests</hi> to the Table of our Lord: If we can <hi>sincerely</hi> pay our Vows at his Altar, we may <hi>confidently</hi> take the <hi>Cup of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi> And having thus <hi>chained</hi> up our <hi>Lusts</hi> by the <hi>Vows</hi> of Obedience we have paid there, it will be hard for them to shake off such <hi>mighty Fetters,</hi> or ever to get loose again from so <hi>strict</hi> a <hi>Confinement;</hi> especially if we take care to <hi>repeat</hi> this our <hi>Sacramental Vow</hi> as often as conveniently we can. For (as I have already shewed you) the <hi>frequent Renewal</hi> of our holy Vows and Resolutions does mightily tend to <hi>strengthen</hi> and <hi>reinforce</hi> them: And therefore it is worth observing, how much care Christ hath taken in the very <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of his Religion, to oblige us to a constant <hi>Repetition</hi> of our Vows and good Purposes. For at our first <hi>Entrance</hi> into Covenant with him, we are to be <hi>baptized;</hi> in which Solemnity we do <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:34683:164"/>
the Devil and all his Works, and religiously <hi>devote</hi> our selves to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: But because we are apt to <hi>forget</hi> our Vows, and the matter of it is <hi>continually</hi> to be performed, and more than one World doth depend upon it; therefore he hath thought fit not to trust to our <hi>first Engagement,</hi> but so to methodize our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that we should ever and anon be obliged to give him <hi>new Security.</hi> For which End he hath instituted this <hi>other Sacrament,</hi> which is not like that of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> to be received by us once for all, but is to be often <hi>repeated;</hi> that so at every <hi>return</hi> of it we might be obliged again to <hi>renew</hi> our old Vows of Obedience: And doubtless would we but follow this good Design of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> we should be far more successful in our <hi>Religion</hi> than we are. For till we come to a <hi>confirm'd</hi> State of Goodness, our holy Fervour will be very apt to <hi>cool,</hi> our good Purposes to <hi>slacken</hi> and <hi>unwind,</hi> and our vertuous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to <hi>languish</hi> and grow <hi>weary:</hi> So that unless we <hi>revive</hi> our Religion by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Restoratives,</hi> in a little time it will <hi>faint,</hi> and dye away. Wherefore to keep it <hi>alive,</hi> it is very necessary that we should come to our great Master's Table every time we are invited by the solemn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:34683:165"/>
of this <hi>holy Festival;</hi> that here we may <hi>renew</hi> our Vows, and <hi>reinvigorate</hi> our Resolutions, and <hi>repair</hi> our Decays, and put our sluggish Graces into a <hi>new Fermentation:</hi> And if we would thus <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> communicate with a due <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Mind, we should doubtless at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sacrament acquire <hi>new</hi> Life and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, and our <hi>good Resolutions</hi> would eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day get ground of our <hi>bad Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> till at last they had totally <hi>subdued</hi> them.</p>
               <p>VI. And Lastly, ANOTHER <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Mortification</hi> is <hi>constant Prayer.</hi> For besides that by our <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>honest Prayers</hi> we are sure to obtain <hi>Strength</hi> and <hi>Assistance</hi> from God, to enable us to vanquish and subdue our Lusts, he having <hi>promised</hi> to give his Holy Spirit unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that <hi>asketh</hi> it: Besides this, I say, by a <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>serious</hi> Devotion our Hearts will be filled with such an <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awing</hi> Sense of God, that in all our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions we shall <hi>dread</hi> and <hi>revere</hi> his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and be ready to <hi>tremble</hi> at every Thought of offending him. For there is nothing gives us such a <hi>quick</hi> Sense of God, as <hi>Prayer;</hi> that being the most <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Address</hi> that we can make to him, and the <hi>highest Elevation</hi> of our Souls to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:34683:165"/>
him. For we are a sort of Beings that are a kin to <hi>two</hi> Worlds, being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the middle between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> as the common <hi>Center</hi> wherein these distant Regions meet. By our <hi>supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour</hi> Faculties we hold Communion with the <hi>spiritual</hi> World, and by our <hi>inferiour</hi> with the <hi>corporeal</hi> one: But to this <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> or <hi>corporeal</hi> World we lye <hi>open</hi> and <hi>bare,</hi> all its Objects being <hi>present</hi> to us, and striking <hi>immediately</hi> on our Senses; whereas between us and the <hi>spiritual</hi> World there is a Cloud of <hi>sensible</hi> things, which <hi>interrupts</hi> our Prospect of that clear Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven above them; so that before we can perceive that which is <hi>Divine,</hi> we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move <hi>this World</hi> out of the way, and withdraw our <hi>Souls</hi> from those <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Desires</hi> wherein these <hi>lower</hi> things have entangled them; that so we may lye open to the <hi>heavenly</hi> Light, and our <hi>cold</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections may be immediately exposed to the <hi>enlivening</hi> Warmths of the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteousness.</hi> And hence arises the Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of holy <hi>Meditations</hi> and devout <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> the one being necessary to <hi>abstract</hi> our Minds from the Objects of <hi>corporeal</hi> Sense, and the other to <hi>inspire</hi> our Wills with <hi>divine</hi> Affections and Inclinations: For <hi>Meditation</hi> furnishes our <hi>Understandings</hi>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:34683:166"/>
with noble Thoughts and heavenly Ideas; and Prayer carries out our <hi>Wills</hi> to the Love of them, and joyns our <hi>Affections</hi> fast to them; so that by the <hi>one</hi> we are tied in our <hi>Minds,</hi> and by the <hi>other</hi> in our <hi>Choice</hi> of the better World. For <hi>Prayer</hi> does naturally <hi>sublimate</hi> our gross, and earthly <hi>Passions;</hi> and by keeping our Minds intent upon <hi>God,</hi> it wings our Affections towards <hi>him,</hi> and animates them with <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Fires: And we do never rise from our Knees after a <hi>devout</hi> Address unto God, without deriving a <hi>magnetick</hi> Vertue from him, and being <hi>sensibly</hi> touched with his <hi>Charms</hi> and <hi>Attractions.</hi> So that if we did but inure our selves to <hi>fervent Prayer,</hi> those holy <hi>Affections</hi> which we should suck in with our <hi>Devotions</hi> would be instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to <hi>extinguish</hi> our vicious <hi>Inclinations;</hi> and we should go every day from the Throne of Grace with such a <hi>lively</hi> Sense of <hi>God,</hi> and such a <hi>vigorous</hi> Relish of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> things, as would be sufficient to <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote</hi> us all the day after against the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom of any <hi>sinful Contagion.</hi> Wherefore if we are in good <hi>earnest,</hi> and do <hi>seriously</hi> intend the <hi>Mortification</hi> of our Lusts, let us every day before we go into the World be <hi>seasoning</hi> of our Minds with <hi>holy Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and while we are <hi>addressing</hi> unto
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:34683:166"/>
God in the deepest Sense of his unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Perfections,</hi> and of our own <hi>Dependence</hi> upon him, let us pour out our <hi>Souls</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and make an hearty Oblation of our <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies</hi> to him. Let us offer up our <hi>Wills</hi> to him <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite,</hi> that he may put them into what <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Posture</hi> he pleases; shew him an Heart that quitteth all Interest in <hi>it self,</hi> and that would be only led and conducted by <hi>him;</hi> tell him that you are sensible, that to <hi>mortify</hi> your Lusts is far more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult than to <hi>resolve</hi> to do it; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech him to <hi>enable</hi> you to be valiant in your <hi>Actions,</hi> as through his Grace you are already in your <hi>Minds</hi> and Hearts; that you may with as much <hi>Certainty,</hi> if not with as much <hi>Ease, do</hi> and <hi>effect,</hi> as you have <hi>projected</hi> and <hi>resolved.</hi> And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus implored <hi>his</hi> Aid, and sincerely offered up your selves unto <hi>him,</hi> you have laid a strong <hi>Engagement</hi> upon him not to abandon you: For to be sure he will not <hi>throw</hi> away a Heart, that puts it self thus <hi>humbly</hi> into his hands; nor suffer the <hi>Devil</hi> to make a <hi>Prey</hi> of that which hath been so affectionately <hi>devoted</hi> to him. For it was by the Concurrence of <hi>his Grace,</hi> with our <hi>own Faculties,</hi> that this Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Submission</hi> to him was <hi>begotten</hi> in us;
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:34683:167"/>
and can we think that the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> will ever <hi>abandon</hi> his own <hi>Offspring,</hi> while it <hi>crys</hi> out to him, and with pitiful and bemoaning Looks <hi>implores</hi> his Aid and Compassion? Surely this cannot choose but <hi>move</hi> his <hi>Fatherly</hi> Bowels, and make them <hi>yern</hi> and <hi>turn</hi> towards it, and by a strong Sympathy draw his <hi>compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> Arm to <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>relieve</hi> it. Let us therefore but faithfully use our own <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,</hi> and fervently implore <hi>God's Grace;</hi> and then to be sure he will never suffer that <hi>Divine Fire,</hi> which he hath <hi>kindled</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, to be <hi>over-born</hi> by our <hi>Corruptions;</hi> but will kindly cherish it with his own <hi>Influence,</hi> and touch it with an out-stretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Ray</hi> from Himself, till it hath burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through all that Rubbish that oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it, and till it rises into a <hi>victorious Flame.</hi>

               <p>HAVING shewn you at large what are the proper <hi>Instruments</hi> of <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> I shall in the next place proceed to press you with some prevailing <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> and <hi>Arguments</hi> faithfully to employ and use them. And here I shall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon those <hi>Arguments</hi> which arise from the Consideration of the <hi>future State,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>these</hi> will fall in hereafter, when I come to discourse upon <hi>it:</hi> All the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that I shall here urge therefore to press you to <hi>mortify</hi> your Sins, shall be drawn from the Consideration of those <hi>present Miseries</hi> and <hi>Inconveniences</hi> which they bring you into. And these I shall rank under two general Heads:</p>

               <p>I. THE <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>Bodily Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> which our Sins bring upon us are chiefly these Four;</p>

               </list>
               <p>I. CONSIDER how your Sins destroy your <hi>Health</hi> and shorten your <hi>Lives.</hi> And to convince you of this, I need do no more than only to lead you into the <hi>Slaughter-houses</hi> of Death, and to shew you how <hi>thick</hi> they are hung round about with the numerous Trophies of <hi>Lust</hi> and <hi>Intemperance:</hi> Behold, there lieth an <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer</hi> choaked with the stench of his own Rottenness; there a <hi>Drunkard</hi> fettered with Gouts, and drowned in Catarrhs and Dropsies; there a <hi>Glutton</hi> stifled with the Loads of his own undigested Meals; loe there lye the dismembred Martyrs of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi> and <hi>Insolence,</hi> that have lost their Limbs upon the Field in a foolish Quarrel for <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Mistresses;</hi> and there the Envoys of <hi>Rapine</hi> and <hi>Murder,</hi> whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Carkasses have furnished the <hi>Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds</hi> and the <hi>Gallows.</hi> These and such like woful <hi>Examples</hi> almost every day's <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> presents to our View, which one would think were <hi>sufficient</hi> to warn Men of those <hi>Vices,</hi> which they so commonly
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:34683:168"/>
find attended with such <hi>tragical Effects:</hi> And indeed there is no <hi>Vice</hi> whatsoever, but does one way or other undermine our <hi>Health,</hi> and impair the <hi>Strengths</hi> of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For all <hi>Viciousness</hi> consists in an <hi>Excess</hi> either of our <hi>Passions,</hi> or our <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites;</hi> and it is plain and obvious, how destructive to our <hi>Health</hi> the wild <hi>Excesses</hi> of our <hi>Appetites</hi> are: how naturally <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness</hi> doth <hi>melt</hi> our Strength, <hi>consume</hi> our Spirits, and <hi>rot</hi> our Bones: how <hi>Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> obstructs our Breath, oppresses our Stomachs, and drowns our Bodies in <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsome Crudities:</hi> how <hi>Drunkenness</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames our Livers, corrupts our Blood, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes our Brains, and converts us into walking Hospitals of <hi>Diseases.</hi> And as for the <hi>Excesses</hi> of our <hi>Passion,</hi> it is no less apparent how much they <hi>disturb</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compose</hi> our Natures: Thus <hi>Anger</hi> we see fires the Spirits and inflames the Blood, and makes the Humors sharp and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding: Thus <hi>immoderate Sorrow</hi> oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the Heart, dries the Bones, shrivels the Skin, and overcasts the Spirits with Clouds of <hi>Melancholy:</hi> Thus <hi>Envy</hi> swells the Hypocondries, which by drinking up the Nourishment of the neighbouring Parts, makes the whole Body <hi>lean</hi> and <hi>meager:</hi> And in a word, thus <hi>excessive Fear</hi> stagnates
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:34683:169"/>
the flowing Spirits, and turns the Blood into a <hi>trembling Ielly.</hi> And such <hi>Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> as these, when they are frequent, must needs gradually <hi>undermine</hi> the Forts of Life, and hasten them into an <hi>untimely Ruin.</hi> Now is it not very strange, that those Men who are commonly so <hi>over-tender</hi> of their <hi>Lives,</hi> should be <hi>fond</hi> of <hi>Diseases,</hi> and <hi>court</hi> their own <hi>Executioners?</hi> That they should <hi>choose</hi> to swallow <hi>Sicknesses,</hi> to drink dead <hi>Palsies,</hi> and foaming <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsies,</hi> and to pass through so severe a Discipline of <hi>Torments,</hi> only to get an Habit of <hi>destroying</hi> themselves? 'Tis true indeed, some there are that have been so <hi>naturaliz'd</hi> to their <hi>Vices,</hi> that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>live,</hi> nor be <hi>well</hi> without them; that are <hi>sick</hi> while they are <hi>temperate,</hi> and are not able to sleep, but in a Sea of Liquor, and are fain to put themselves into <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses</hi> of <hi>Passion</hi> to <hi>ferment</hi> their Blood, and <hi>rouse</hi> their drousy Spirits: But then it is to be considered, that generally they bring themselves to this sad pass by their own evil <hi>Habits,</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> which they acquire, by doing great <hi>Violence</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and committing forcible <hi>Outrages</hi> on their own Natures. There is no <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable Passion,</hi> or <hi>Appetite</hi> can be <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> to our <hi>Health,</hi> or <hi>Ease,</hi> till we are
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:34683:169"/>
first <hi>habituated</hi> to them; and before we can be <hi>habituated,</hi> we must undergo a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious <hi>Course</hi> of Pain and Uneasiness; many a Fit of <hi>tormenting Rage</hi> must be endured, many an uneasy Draught and sickly Qualm and fainting Sweat must be undergone, before <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> can be made <hi>easy</hi> and <hi>pleasant</hi> to us; and much more before they become <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> Remedies: And it is rare, if ever we have need of these Excesses, till by a long <hi>Course</hi> of Violence upon our selves we have first over-turned our natural <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Constitution.</hi> And what Man in his Wits would ever swallow <hi>Poyson,</hi> meerly to <hi>force</hi> his Nature into a <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation</hi> with it; when he is sure before hand, that if he doth not <hi>die</hi> in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,</hi> (as 'tis a great Chance but he doth) yet that he must undergo many a <hi>Sickness</hi> and bitter <hi>Agony,</hi> before his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is so <hi>accustomed</hi> to it as to be <hi>preserved</hi> and <hi>nourished</hi> by it? But alas! by that time we are arrived to that Pitch of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,</hi> as to be drunk without the Penance of a <hi>Surfeit</hi> or a <hi>Fever,</hi> the Heat and Vigour of our Nature is usually so <hi>quenched</hi> with crude Humors, our Spirits so <hi>drowned</hi> in Rheums, and Dropsies, and our Brains so <hi>drenched</hi> in Clouds of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsome
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:34683:170"/>
Moisture, that all our Life after we are but so many <hi>walking Statues</hi> of Earth and Flegme; and having washed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the Principles of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion</hi> in us, we grow old in <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishness,</hi> and at the last die <hi>Changelings.</hi> Thus Sin, you see, is a <hi>Disease</hi> to the <hi>Body;</hi> it wasts our <hi>Strength,</hi> and either makes the <hi>Candle</hi> of our Life to burn <hi>dim,</hi> or <hi>blazes</hi> it out into an untimely Period. Why then should we not be as earnest in the Cure of <hi>this,</hi> as we are of our <hi>other Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses?</hi> For doubtless would we but as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully apply the Means and Instruments of <hi>Mortification,</hi> as we do, when we are sick of a Feaver or an Ague, the proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies against them; we should quickly cure those <hi>Excesses</hi> of our Passions, and Appetites, which do so <hi>disease</hi> our Bodies, and <hi>disturb</hi> our Natures.</p>
               <p>II. CONSIDER how your Sins do stain and blemish your <hi>Reputation.</hi> For there is nothing in the whole World more <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> to Men, than to <hi>admire</hi> Virtue and <hi>disesteem</hi> Vice wheresoever they find it: This we seem to do by a <hi>Natural Instinct,</hi> antecedently to all our <hi>Reasoning</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;</hi> and it is no more in our <hi>Power</hi> not to do it, than it is to chuse whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our Pulse shall beat, or our Blood cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate.
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:34683:170"/>
For that Virtue is an <hi>Ornament,</hi> and Vice a <hi>Deformity</hi> to humane Nature, is a Proposition so <hi>self-evident,</hi> that at the first Proposal it commands the Assent of all <hi>Rational Beings;</hi> nor is it in any Man's Power so far to offer <hi>Violence</hi> to his own Faculties, as to believe Vice <hi>praise-worthy,</hi> or <hi>commendable,</hi> any more than it is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>that</hi> to be <hi>white</hi> and <hi>strait,</hi> which he sees to be <hi>black</hi> and <hi>crooked:</hi> And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly you will find, that by all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind it hath ever been branded with an <hi>infamous</hi> Character, and looked on as a <hi>Disparagment</hi> to the noblest Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For in all the Monuments of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages; never were any Man's <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Intemperances</hi> recorded among the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of his <hi>Honour;</hi> nor was there ever any one Canonized in the Records of <hi>Fame,</hi> for being a <hi>Villain,</hi> or a great <hi>Debauchee.</hi> But generally they are the <hi>Wise,</hi> or the <hi>Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,</hi> the <hi>Iust,</hi> or the <hi>Merciful,</hi> the <hi>Chast,</hi> or the <hi>Liberal,</hi> whose Names have been <hi>consecrated</hi> in History; and no Man ever acquired a Glorious Memory, but it was either by being <hi>vertuous,</hi> or by <hi>seeming</hi> to be so. And though wicked Men, like Glow-worms, do sometimes shine in the dark, where either their Vice is not <hi>seen,</hi> or is <hi>mistaken</hi> for Vertue; yet usually at
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:34683:171"/>
the Approach either of <hi>Time,</hi> or <hi>Light,</hi> their <hi>Luster</hi> vanishes and goes out in <hi>Stink</hi> and <hi>Dishonour.</hi> So that methinks had we any regard to our own <hi>Reputation,</hi> we should <hi>scorn</hi> to harbour those <hi>infamous</hi> Lusts, which in the Opinion of all the World are so great <hi>Disparagements</hi> to us: For what a monstrous <hi>Shame</hi> is it to be despised by all <hi>wise</hi> Men, to be hooted at by <hi>Boys,</hi> to be talked of in Fairs and Markets, and pointed at and described by Appellatives of <hi>Scorn?</hi> And yet all this we expose our selves to for the sake of a few <hi>base Lusts,</hi> which cause us to <hi>rot</hi> above ground and to <hi>stink</hi> alive, and when we are dead will strew our Graves with <hi>Dishonour,</hi> and inroll our Names in the black Records of <hi>Infamy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. CONSIDER how your Vices do waste and consume your <hi>Estates.</hi> For ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally it is a very <hi>chargeable</hi> thing to be <hi>wicked,</hi> there being few <hi>Lusts</hi> but do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a large <hi>Revenue</hi> to maintain them: For what a vast <hi>Expence</hi> is the <hi>Epicure</hi> at to provide Meat and Drink-Offerings for that Idol-God his <hi>Belly?</hi> What an inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable <hi>Charge</hi> is it to the prodigal <hi>ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Fool</hi> to gratify all his Vanities, and plume the Wings of his <hi>Fantastick Pride?</hi> How much does it cost the <hi>insatiate Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:34683:171"/>
to make Provision for his unbounded <hi>Sensuality?</hi> How many a fair Estate hath there been spent in <hi>litigious Suits</hi> at Law, meerly to improve a Quarrel, and gratify a silly Revenge? And how many a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous Trader hath undermined himself by his own <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Knavery;</hi> whilst for a present <hi>dishonest Gain</hi> he loses a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomer, by whom he might have honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gotten ten times more in seven years Trade and Commerce? And indeed for the generality there is a world of <hi>ill Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry</hi> in being <hi>wicked;</hi> most of our <hi>Lusts</hi> being like the Holes of a <hi>Sieve,</hi> through which our Estate runs out as fast as we can pour it in: And I believe it were easy to demonstrate, that the <hi>Ruin</hi> of most Families, and the <hi>Beggery</hi> of most Persons, is owing to one <hi>Vice</hi> or other; and that where one is sunk by meer <hi>Misfortune,</hi> there are twenty ruined by their own <hi>Wickedness.</hi> Now what Man in his wits would keep such a company of <hi>devouring Lusts</hi> about him, that are perpetually spun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging upon his <hi>Estate,</hi> and eating the Bread out of his <hi>Childrens</hi> Mouths? Who would ever expose <hi>himself</hi> and his <hi>Family</hi> to the hazard of <hi>Want</hi> and <hi>Beggery,</hi> meerly to gratify an unreasonable <hi>Passion,</hi> or to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate a wild and intemperate <hi>Appetite?</hi>
                  <pb n="316" facs="tcp:34683:172"/>
But perhaps you think that there is no great Danger of this; for whatever comes of it, you will take care of the <hi>main Chance,</hi> and be such <hi>good Husbands</hi> in your Wickedness, as to be sure not to impair your Estates by it. Alas poor Men! you know not what you will be; for when once you are set into a <hi>Course</hi> of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, you are like so many eager <hi>Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> that when they set to it resolve to lose but a <hi>Crown,</hi> or a <hi>Piece</hi> at most; but when they have lost that, they double their Stakes in hope to recover all again, and so game on till they have <hi>no more</hi> to lose. And first perhaps your <hi>Lusts</hi> will be very <hi>modest,</hi> and <hi>content</hi> themselves with the cheapest Provisions you can make for them; but when once they have <hi>inveagled</hi> and <hi>drawn</hi> you in, they will still be cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more costly Entertainments, and will by <hi>degrees</hi> so encroach upon you, that you know not when or where you shall stop: So that 'tis in vain for you to talk what you will do, for either you must <hi>mortify</hi> your Lusts, or resolve to <hi>gratify</hi> them; and if you do the latter, there is no End of it; for like the <hi>Daughters of the Horseleech,</hi> they will still be crying <hi>Give, Give,</hi> till you have no more to give, and then they will prey upon <hi>your selves.</hi>
               </p>

Luxury, and be only barred from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent <hi>Sting</hi> of it.

<pb n="323" facs="tcp:34683:175"/>
Sin is an <hi>Affront</hi> to our <hi>Understandings,</hi> and a plain <hi>Contradiction</hi> to the Reason of our <hi>Minds;</hi> there being no <hi>Vice</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever but what is founded in <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Unreasonableness.</hi> Whilst therefore we live in <hi>Sin,</hi> we do so far lay aside our <hi>Reason,</hi> (which ought to be the Moderator of our Actions) and abandon our selves to the Conduct of our own blind <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites</hi> and head-strong <hi>Passions;</hi> which will naturally <hi>weaken</hi> our Rational <hi>Faculties,</hi> and bring a lingering <hi>Consumption</hi> on our <hi>Understandings.</hi> For as our <hi>Powers</hi> are improved and perfected by <hi>Exercise,</hi> so they are impaired and wasted by <hi>Disuse</hi> and <hi>Inactivity;</hi> and therefore our <hi>Reason</hi> being such a <hi>Power</hi> as is not naturally to be perfected but by <hi>Action,</hi> it necessarily follows that the less <hi>active</hi> it is, the more <hi>imperfect</hi> it must be. Whilst therefore we live in <hi>Sin,</hi> or (which is all one) in the <hi>Neglect</hi> of our Reason, we <hi>consume</hi> and <hi>waste</hi> our Rational <hi>Faculties;</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>unemploy'd</hi> will naturally contract <hi>Rust,</hi> and grow every day more <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>restive.</hi> For a Life of <hi>Sin</hi> is all transacted by <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>Passion;</hi> Reason sits looking on, and having no part in the brutish Scene, <hi>melts</hi> away in <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Idleness:</hi> Its Vital Powers <hi>freeze</hi> for want of <hi>Motion,</hi> and like
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:34683:176"/>
standing Waters <hi>stagnate,</hi> and gather Mire till they <hi>corrupt</hi> and <hi>putrify.</hi> And besides this <hi>Decay</hi> that Sin brings upon our <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> by taking us off from the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi> of it, it is also injurious to those bodily <hi>Organs,</hi> by which our <hi>Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> while we are in the Flesh, doth <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> and <hi>operate.</hi> For our Body is as it were the <hi>Musical Instrument,</hi> upon which our Mind sets all its <hi>Harmony,</hi> and by which it runs all the curious Divisions of <hi>Discourse:</hi> And the Blood and Spirits and Brain, and other Parts of it are the <hi>Strings</hi> of this <hi>Instrument,</hi> upon the well-tuning of which depends all the <hi>Musick</hi> of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> But now there is scarce any <hi>Sin,</hi> that doth not some way or other <hi>indispose</hi> our <hi>Bodies</hi> for the use of our <hi>Minds,</hi> and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them <hi>unfit,</hi> especially for the most <hi>perfect</hi> Exercise of our <hi>Reason.</hi> Thus <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness</hi> dilutes the Brain, which is the <hi>Mint</hi> of the Understanding, and <hi>drowns</hi> those Images which are stamp'd upon it in a <hi>Deluge</hi> of unwholsome Moistures. Thus <hi>Gluttony</hi> cloggs the <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits, which are as it were the <hi>Wings</hi> of the Mind, and renders them <hi>incapable</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the noblest and sublimest Flights of <hi>Reason.</hi> Thus <hi>Anger</hi> and <hi>Wantonness</hi> force up the boiling Blood into the Brain,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:34683:176"/>
and by that <hi>disorders</hi> the Motions of the Spirits there, <hi>confounds</hi> the Fantasms, and <hi>disturbs</hi> the Conceptions, and <hi>shuffles</hi> the Ideas of the Imagination into an heap of <hi>inarticulate</hi> and <hi>disorderly</hi> Fancies. And how is it possible our Minds should strike <hi>true Harmony,</hi> when its Instrument is thus <hi>disorder'd,</hi> and all the Strings of it are so <hi>out</hi> of <hi>Tune?</hi> How should we <hi>understand</hi> well, while our <hi>Brains</hi> are <hi>overcast</hi> with the thick Fumes of <hi>sensual</hi> Lusts; and those <hi>Spirits,</hi> which should wing our minds, are grown so <hi>listless</hi> and <hi>unactive,</hi> that they rather <hi>hamper</hi> and <hi>entangle</hi> them? For what Clearness is to the <hi>Eye,</hi> that Purity is to the <hi>Mind:</hi> As <hi>Clearness</hi> doth dispose the <hi>Eye</hi> to a quick and distinct Perception of <hi>Material</hi> Objects; so <hi>Purity</hi> from Lust and Passion disposes the <hi>Mind</hi> to a more clear Apprehension of <hi>Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual</hi> ones; and the more any Man's Soul is <hi>cleansed</hi> from the Filth and Dregs of <hi>Sensuality,</hi> the <hi>brighter</hi> it will be in its Conceptions, and the more <hi>nimble</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite</hi> in its <hi>Operations.</hi> For <hi>Purity</hi> doth naturally fit the <hi>Body</hi> to the <hi>Mind;</hi> it puts its Organs all in <hi>Tune,</hi> and renders its spirits <hi>fine</hi> and <hi>agil,</hi> and fit for the <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest</hi> Exercises of <hi>Reason:</hi> which they can never be, whilst they are subject to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:34683:177"/>
                  <hi>Passions,</hi> and drenched in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholsome Reeks of <hi>Sensuality</hi> and <hi>Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousness.</hi> But besides this <hi>Mischief</hi> which Sin doth to our <hi>Understandings,</hi> by render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>Bodies</hi> unapt to all <hi>Intellectual</hi> Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses; it also dyes the <hi>mind</hi> with <hi>false</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and fills it with <hi>Prejudice,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Apprehensions</hi> of Things. For while our Souls are under the sway of any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly <hi>Passion</hi> or <hi>Appetite,</hi> they will na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally warp our <hi>Iudgments</hi> into a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with their own Interest; and bribe us to <hi>judge</hi> of things, not according to what they <hi>are,</hi> but according to what we would <hi>have</hi> them: And when our <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> are thus bribed by our <hi>Interest,</hi> and swayed by our <hi>Passions,</hi> it is impossible we should <hi>judge truly</hi> of Things. For our <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> will <hi>discolour</hi> the Objects of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, and <hi>disguise</hi> them into such Shapes as are most agreeable to our <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> and <hi>Interest;</hi> and so our <hi>Opinions</hi> of Things will alter upon every Variation of our <hi>Humours,</hi> and our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> like <hi>Weather-cocks,</hi> will be wheeling about up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every <hi>Change</hi> of Wind. So that while we are encompassed with the Mists of <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Prejudice,</hi> they will necessarily hinder the <hi>Prospect</hi> of our <hi>Reason,</hi> and obscure the <hi>Brightness</hi> of our <hi>Understandings,</hi> and
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:34683:177"/>
the <hi>Clearness</hi> of our discerning <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> And thus you see, how natural it is to Vice to <hi>spoil</hi> and <hi>wast</hi> our <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,</hi> and to choke up those Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Light</hi> within us with Clouds and Darkness. And that it doth so is very apparent in Fact; for how much <hi>wicked</hi> Men have lost their <hi>Reason,</hi> is apparent by the <hi>ridiculous Principles</hi> upon which they generally act; which generally are so very <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>absurd,</hi> that it would be <hi>impossible</hi> for Men to assent to them, were not their Understandings <hi>perished,</hi> and the Reason of their minds wofully <hi>impaired</hi> and <hi>wasted.</hi> As for instance; the <hi>desperate Atheist</hi> wishes that there were no God, upon this Principle, that it is better for Men to be without a <hi>God,</hi> than to be without their <hi>Lusts;</hi> then which there can be nothing more <hi>wild</hi> or <hi>extravagant:</hi> For it is plain that <hi>without</hi> our Lusts we can be <hi>happier</hi> than <hi>with</hi> them; whereas it is the <hi>common Interest</hi> of Mankind, that the World should be governed by infinite <hi>Goodness</hi> conducted by infinite <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Wisdom;</hi> and no Man, or Society of Men can be <hi>happy</hi> without it. For take <hi>God</hi> out of the World, and you take away all <hi>Hope</hi> from the miserable, all <hi>Comfort</hi> from the sorrowful, and all <hi>Support</hi> from the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:34683:178"/>
dejected and calamitous; and at one blow cut in sunder all the Bands of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> rase the Foundations of <hi>Virtue,</hi> and confound all Distinction between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi> And yet the besotted Wretch, for the sake of a paltry <hi>Lust</hi> that <hi>betrays</hi> him with a Kiss, and <hi>stings</hi> him in the Enjoyment, would fain banish <hi>God</hi> out of the World; though it is apparent that in so doing he would do Mankind more <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,</hi> than if he should blow out all the <hi>Lights</hi> of Heaven, or pull down the <hi>Sun</hi> from the Firmament. And in the general, what more <hi>ridiculous Principles</hi> can there be thought, than such as these; <hi>That Sense is to be preferred before Reason, Earth before Heaven, Moments before Eternity; that the short-liv'd pleasures of sin, which expire in the fruition, are sufficient to ballance the loss of an immortal Heaven, and the sense of an eternal Hell; that 'tis time enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent when we can sin no more; and that God is so fond a Being, as that rather than ruin those that wilfully spurn at his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and trample upon his Laws, he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a few Tears and Promises to live well, when we can live no longer, in exchange for all the Duty we owe him; and that we may sit all the day in the lap of our Lusts, and enjoy them without controul, and then</hi>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:34683:178"/>
                  <hi>at night when we can enjoy them no longer fly up to Heaven, upon the Wings of a Lord have mercy upon us.</hi> And yet a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Life is either built upon <hi>no Principles</hi> at all, or upon such as <hi>these;</hi> which are ridiculous beyond all the extravagant Conceits of <hi>Fools,</hi> or <hi>Madmen.</hi> 'Tis no wonder therefore, that the Scripture so frequently brands the <hi>Sinner</hi> with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Character of a <hi>Fool;</hi> for if you measure him by the Principles he acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is not a <hi>greater Fool</hi> in Nature: which is a plain Evidence, how much <hi>Vice</hi> doth <hi>besot</hi> the Understandings of Men, and like those Barbarous <hi>Philistines,</hi> puts out their Eyes, only to <hi>sport</hi> it self with their <hi>Follies</hi> and <hi>Extravagances.</hi> So that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks had we any <hi>Reverence</hi> for our own <hi>Reason,</hi> by which we are constituted <hi>Men,</hi> and distinguish'd from the <hi>Beasts</hi> that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish; we should never endure those <hi>Lusts</hi> within our Bosoms, that do so much <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,</hi> and <hi>wast</hi> it.</p>
               <p>II. SIN subverts the <hi>natural</hi> Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our <hi>Faculties.</hi> For the <hi>natural</hi> Order and Politie of our <hi>Natures</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the Dominion of our <hi>Rational</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, over our sensitive Passions and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites; so that then only we live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Law</hi> of our <hi>Nature,</hi> when we eat and drink, and love and hate, and

fear and hope, and desire and delight, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as <hi>right Reason,</hi> prescribes. For the <hi>noblest</hi> Principle of Humane Nature is <hi>Reason,</hi> by which it is that we are constituted <hi>Men,</hi> and advanced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Form</hi> of Beings above all <hi>sublunary</hi> Creatures; and this <hi>Reason</hi> of ours is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in us, by the great Author of our Beings, for no other End, but only to <hi>steer</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> us; to be an <hi>Eye</hi> to our blind and brutish <hi>Affections,</hi> to <hi>correct</hi> the Errors of our <hi>Imaginations,</hi> and <hi>bound</hi> the Extravagances of our <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,</hi> and to <hi>regulate</hi> the whole Course of our <hi>Actions;</hi> so as that we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean our selves, as <hi>becomes</hi> such <hi>Beings</hi> as we are, and placed in such <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Circumstances.</hi> God therefore having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded us of contrary <hi>Natures,</hi> viz. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> and <hi>Sensual,</hi> which are pregnant with contrary <hi>Inclinations</hi> and <hi>Affections;</hi> from hence arises the <hi>Necessity</hi> of all those Heroic <hi>Virtues,</hi> which consist in the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi> of our <hi>Reason</hi> over our Sensitive <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Appetites;</hi> such as Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Sobriety, Meekness and Equanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the like; all which are proper to us as Beings made up of contrary <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> from whence spring those contrary <hi>Inclinations,</hi> in the good or bad <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> whereof consists the Nature of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
                  <pb n="331" facs="tcp:34683:179"/>
and <hi>Vice.</hi> Whilst therefore we keep our Brutal <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Appetites</hi> in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to our <hi>Reason,</hi> we follow the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Current of <hi>Humane Nature;</hi> in which our <hi>best</hi> and <hi>noblest</hi> Principle <hi>rules,</hi> and all our <hi>inferiour</hi> Powers are regularly <hi>subordinate</hi> to it: But when we degenerate into a State of <hi>Sin,</hi> we thereby <hi>discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> the Harmony of our Natures, and put all our well-ranked Faculties into a strange <hi>Disorder</hi> and <hi>Confusion.</hi> For every Sin is a <hi>Rebellion</hi> either of our Passions, or Appetites against our <hi>Reason;</hi> and we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver commit any known Evil, but we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>affront</hi> our own <hi>Understandings,</hi> and offer open <hi>Violence</hi> to those <hi>superiour</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties that should <hi>rule</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> us. So that when by a <hi>Custom</hi> of <hi>sinning,</hi> our Passions and Appetites have been <hi>train'd</hi> up for a while in <hi>Disobedience</hi> to our <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> they will by degrees grow so <hi>head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strong</hi> and <hi>ungovernable,</hi> that it will be a hard matter to restrain them within any Compass of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Sobriety;</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we take a world of pains to <hi>suppress</hi> them, they will never leave <hi>rioting</hi> and <hi>tumultuating</hi> within us, till they have broke through all their <hi>natural</hi> Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into a <hi>licentious, wild,</hi> and <hi>bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Anarchy; and having thus got head
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:34683:180"/>
within us, and beaten our <hi>Reason</hi> from its <hi>native Throne,</hi> they will hurry us head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into all manner of <hi>Follies</hi> and <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances.</hi> For now we shall act no longer from <hi>Reason,</hi> but from <hi>Sense;</hi> our Nature being <hi>turn'd</hi> upside-down, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Points of our Motion <hi>chang'd</hi> into quite contrary Positions; so that our <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> will stand us in no other stead, but only to cater for our <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>sensitive Affections,</hi> and to make us <hi>Brutes</hi> with greater <hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Relish:</hi> And being thus wholly acted by our <hi>brutish Sense,</hi> and led only by the <hi>blind</hi> Instincts of the <hi>Flesh,</hi> our <hi>Reason</hi> will have no hand in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> of our <hi>Lives;</hi> but, like the Beasts of the Field, we shall live at random, and do things, not because they are <hi>reasonable</hi> in themselves, but because they are <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> to our unreasonable <hi>Affections</hi> and <hi>Appetites.</hi> Such a strange <hi>Disorder</hi> doth Sin bring upon our <hi>Natures;</hi> so miserably doth it <hi>blend</hi> and <hi>confound</hi> our Faculties, that were it not for our <hi>Speech</hi> and <hi>Shape,</hi> it would scarce leave us any remaining Character of <hi>Distinction</hi> from the <hi>Beasts</hi> that perish. For it dissolves our <hi>Reason</hi> into a meer <hi>sensual Sagacity,</hi> and enslaves that <hi>high-born</hi> Power to every <hi>base</hi> Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Appetite; and so reduces our
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:34683:180"/>
                  <hi>well-formed Natures</hi> into an undistinguish'd <hi>Chaos,</hi> where Sense and Reason, Brute and Man are <hi>shuffled</hi> together in a heap of rude and undigested <hi>Ruins.</hi> So that methinks had we any Reverence for that <hi>excellent Nature</hi> that we carry about with us, that <hi>Nature</hi> by which we are allied to <hi>Angels,</hi> and do border upon <hi>God</hi> himself; we should never endure to harbour those <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane Lusts,</hi> that do so <hi>disorder</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found</hi> it, that make such <hi>Spoils</hi> and <hi>Deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations</hi> within us, that do so disturb the <hi>Harmony</hi> of our Faculties, and disjoint the very <hi>Frame</hi> of our Beings.</p>
               <p>III. SIN <hi>disturbs</hi> the Tranquillity of our <hi>Minds;</hi> and this naturally follows from the <hi>former:</hi> For the <hi>Mind</hi> of Man can never be at <hi>Ease,</hi> so long as its <hi>Bones</hi> are out of joint, and all its <hi>Faculties</hi> so wofully <hi>disorder'd.</hi> For thus every thing is at <hi>Ease,</hi> so long as it is in its own <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> State and Condition; but when once its Parts are <hi>displaced,</hi> or put into a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order,</hi> or <hi>distorted</hi> into an unnatural Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure; it is in <hi>restless</hi> Motion, till it <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns</hi> again to the specifick State and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of its own <hi>Nature.</hi> And so it is with the <hi>Mind</hi> of Man; which while it preserves its own <hi>natural Station,</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority</hi> over our Affections and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites,
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:34683:181"/>
is <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>serene,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys within it self perpetual <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Tranquility:</hi> But being thrown out of its <hi>native Throne,</hi> and led into <hi>Captivity</hi> by its own <hi>Vassals,</hi> it can find no Rest in this <hi>preternatural</hi> State; but, like a disjointed Member, is in perpetual <hi>Anguish,</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xiety;</hi> and having, like all other Things, an inward <hi>strong Propension</hi> to its own <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> State and Condition, it will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually <hi>struggling</hi> and <hi>contending</hi> towards it, till it hath quite <hi>wearied</hi> and <hi>tired</hi> out it self with its own vain and ineffectual Efforts; and then it will sit down and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan it self, and pine away with <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Diffatisfaction.</hi> And hence it is that in the Course of a <hi>wicked Life</hi> we feel such Contentions between the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit,</hi> such perpetual Broils between the Law in our <hi>Minds,</hi> and the Law in our <hi>Members;</hi> which proceeds from this <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Struggling,</hi> and <hi>Conatus</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi> to recover its <hi>native Empire</hi> over our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Appetites: From which it will never wholly surcease, till it is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>subdu'd</hi> to the Will of the <hi>Flesh;</hi> and when it is so, it will be perpetually <hi>torn</hi> and <hi>distracted</hi> by those various <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>inconsistent</hi> Affections, whereunto it will be subjected. For so long as our <hi>Passions</hi>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:34683:181"/>
are subject to our <hi>Reason,</hi> there can be no <hi>Division</hi> among them; because nothing can <hi>divide</hi> our <hi>Passions,</hi> but only our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing to our selves <hi>different</hi> and <hi>contrary</hi> Ends: But the Ends of <hi>Reason</hi> are all <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent</hi> with, and <hi>subordinate</hi> to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, its <hi>lesser</hi> and <hi>inferiour</hi> Ends being only the Inns at which it baits upon the Road towards its <hi>superiour</hi> ones; and whilst we are under the Power and Conduct of <hi>one</hi> Sovereign End, our <hi>Passions</hi> must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily <hi>joyn</hi> hand in hand, and walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether like Brethren in <hi>Unity.</hi> But when once they have shaken off the Yoke of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and submitted themselves to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>Sense;</hi> among that great <hi>Variety</hi> of Ends and Objects which <hi>Sense</hi> proposes to them, they must needs be <hi>torn</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided</hi> one from another. For such is the <hi>Scantiness</hi> of <hi>Sensual</hi> Goods, that we not being able to <hi>content</hi> our selves with any <hi>one</hi> of them, are fain to walk the Rounds in a constant Succession and Circle of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties;</hi> and then every one of these <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goods</hi> will create within us a <hi>vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Desire:</hi> And so as <hi>Sense</hi> doth multiply its <hi>Temptations,</hi> we shall still multiply our <hi>Desires</hi> and <hi>Affections;</hi> and at every <hi>new Game</hi> that springs, we shall still let fly <hi>new Passions.</hi> But now the Ends of <hi>Vice</hi> are
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:34683:182"/>
not only <hi>various,</hi> but also <hi>contrary</hi> to, and <hi>inconsistent</hi> with one another: For all <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> consisting in Extreams, either in <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses</hi> or <hi>Defects,</hi> their Ends must be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> too, and so they cannot but disagree; <hi>Excess</hi> and <hi>Defect</hi> being in themselves <hi>most contrary.</hi> And these <hi>contrary Vices</hi> must needs raise <hi>contrary Factions</hi> in the <hi>Mind,</hi> and people it with a Rabble of <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>inconsistent</hi> Passions; which will be always bandying one against another, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently embroiling the <hi>Soul</hi> in eternal <hi>Mutinies</hi> and <hi>Tumults.</hi> And this is the State of every <hi>vicious</hi> Man; he is divided into infinite <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Separations;</hi> and like a <hi>barbarous Countrey,</hi> cantoned out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a World of petty Principalities, which are always together by the Ears, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually invading one anothers Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now what a miserable <hi>Distraction</hi> must a Man's <hi>Mind</hi> be in, when it is thus <hi>justl'd</hi> to and fro in such a crowd of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> and <hi>impetuous</hi> Passions; when <hi>Pride</hi> shoves it one way, and <hi>Covetousness</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; when <hi>Ambition</hi> thrusts it forward, and <hi>Cowardise</hi> pulls it back again; and so many <hi>different Lusts</hi> do at the same time hurry it so many <hi>different</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Ways?</hi> How is it possible it should escape <hi>Actaeon</hi>'s Fate, to be worried till it
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:34683:182"/>
is torn in pieces by its own Hounds? And therefore as we value the <hi>Peace</hi> of our own <hi>Minds,</hi> and would not have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Harmony</hi> discompos'd by the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Iarrings</hi> of so many <hi>contrary</hi> Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it concerns us to <hi>subdue</hi> and <hi>mortify</hi> our <hi>Lusts:</hi> For so long as we entertain these seditious <hi>Incendiaries,</hi> they will be perpetually raising <hi>Tumults</hi> within us, and our <hi>Minds</hi> will never be at <hi>quiet</hi> for them. For the only Way to keep our <hi>Minds</hi> at Peace, is to <hi>unite</hi> our <hi>Affections;</hi> which we can never hope to do, till we have <hi>subdu'd</hi> them to the Empire of our <hi>Reason.</hi> But when we come to be under the Command of that <hi>one supreme</hi> End, which our <hi>Reason</hi> will propose to us, as the <hi>utmost Scope</hi> of our <hi>Desires;</hi> then and not till then will these <hi>scattered</hi> Rivulets of our Affections <hi>unite</hi> themselves in <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and flow towards <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean: And then our <hi>Mind</hi> will be at <hi>Rest,</hi> and all its <hi>contrary Passions</hi> being <hi>laid,</hi> which now like the <hi>boisterous Waves</hi> dash one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, it will no longer be <hi>capable</hi> of being <hi>ruffl'd</hi> into a Storm; but in the midst of all the <hi>Changes</hi> of this World, will find it self perpetually inspired with the most <hi>calm,</hi> and <hi>gentle</hi> Thoughts.</p>

out of his <hi>Passion</hi> and <hi>Resurrection,</hi> his <hi>Intercession</hi> for us at the right hand of God, and his <hi>Coming</hi> to judge the World in the <hi>last day:</hi> All which are the Aids and Assistances of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> who hath revealed them to us, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated their <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry <hi>miraculous</hi> Operations; which are therefore called the <hi>Evidences</hi> and <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations</hi> of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> So that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is in the Gospel to enable us to our Duty; whatsoever Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-charms its <hi>Promises</hi> afford us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Charms and Allurements of our own <hi>Lusts;</hi> whatsoever <hi>Antidotes</hi> its <hi>Threatnings</hi> prescribe us against the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of the Devil's Temptations; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <hi>Motives</hi> there are in the <hi>Life,</hi> or <hi>Death, Resurrection,</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> of our Blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> and in his final <hi>Iudgment</hi> by which we must stand, or fall for ever: In a word, whatsoever <hi>Arguments</hi> the Laws or the Creed of our <hi>Holy Religion</hi> offer us, either to <hi>incite</hi> us to our <hi>Duty,</hi> or to <hi>enable</hi> us to baffle the Temptations of <hi>Vice;</hi> they are all from the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and consequently are to be reckon'd among those gracious Aids and Assistances which <hi>He</hi> affords us.

                  <hi>worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly,</hi> is called the <hi>grace of God which bringeth salvation unto all men;</hi> Tit. ii. 11, 12.

and <hi>Assistance,</hi> that there are very few <hi>good Thoughts</hi> or <hi>Purposes</hi> that spring up in our Minds, which have not their <hi>Rise</hi> from some <hi>external</hi> Event of <hi>Divine Providence.</hi> And this we may easily observe, by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the <hi>Train</hi> of our own Thoughts, and pursuing the <hi>Stream</hi> of them to their <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Original:</hi> For though many times we find <hi>good Thoughts</hi> injected into us we know not <hi>how,</hi> nor <hi>whence;</hi> yet, if we do but curiously observe the <hi>Rise</hi> of our soberest Thoughts and Purposes, we shall generally find that it is some <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Accident or other that occasions them. Either our <hi>Sin</hi> betrays us into some great <hi>Shame</hi> or <hi>Infelicity,</hi> or our wicked <hi>Designs</hi> are baffled by some intervening <hi>Accident,</hi> or some remarkable <hi>Iudgment</hi> meets us, as the <hi>Angel</hi> did <hi>Balaam,</hi> in the Road of our <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Wickedness,</hi> by which our <hi>stupid</hi> Consciences are many times <hi>startled</hi> into Reflections; or by some good <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> we are directed to a <hi>serious Book,</hi> or <hi>faithful Guide,</hi> or linked into some <hi>pious Family,</hi> or <hi>vertuous Association,</hi> by whose wise <hi>Admonitions,</hi> holy <hi>Examples,</hi> or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Reproofs,</hi> we are frequently inspired with <hi>good</hi> Thoughts, and <hi>serious</hi> Resolutions; and from these, or such like <hi>Providences</hi> ordinarily spring the Beginnings of our
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:34683:185"/>
                  <hi>Reformation.</hi> So that it is no <hi>mean Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> that the Divine Providence contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to us; but by a thousand <hi>Arts</hi> of Love, and <hi>Methods</hi> of Kindness which we take no <hi>notice</hi> of, it administers to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and serves the everlasting Interests of our <hi>Souls.</hi> Sometimes it <hi>removes</hi> Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from us, and keeps them at a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> while our <hi>Lust</hi> is <hi>hot</hi> and <hi>ready</hi> to take fire, till it is cool'd and extinguish'd by <hi>sober</hi> Counsels: Sometimes by <hi>indiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible Accidents</hi> it suggests good <hi>Thoughts</hi> to us, and raises good <hi>Desires</hi> in us; and then <hi>seconds</hi> those Accidents with such a <hi>Train</hi> of Events, as it knows will be most conducive to <hi>continue</hi> those <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and to <hi>nurse</hi> up those <hi>Desires</hi> into fixt and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Resolutions:</hi> In a word, it observes the <hi>molliafandi-tempora,</hi> and is infinitely watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the <hi>timing</hi> its Addresses, so as to strike while the Iron is <hi>hot,</hi> and to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose when we are most <hi>apt</hi> to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded and wrought upon. If therefore by these Assistances of the <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> we do <hi>mortify</hi> our <hi>Lusts,</hi> we do it by the <hi>Spirit;</hi> who doth so order and dispose all those <hi>outward Events,</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,</hi> as may be most conducive to our <hi>Amendment.</hi>

LET us consider those Aids and Assistances, which the <hi>holy Angels</hi> give us, who are the Agents and Ministers of the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> whom he sends forth to <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour</hi> and <hi>assist</hi> us in the Discharge of our <hi>Duty.</hi> And hence <hi>Heb.</hi> i. 14. they are said to be <hi>ministring spirits sent forth to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister for them who shall be heirs of salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> And in pursuance of this their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry they are said to <hi>pitch</hi> their <hi>tents</hi> round about those that fear God, <hi>Psal.</hi> xxxiv. 7. and God himself hath promised to <hi>give his Angels charge over them to keep them in all their ways,</hi> in the xci. <hi>Psal.</hi> 11. which Expressions, I confess, do immediately refer unto the <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>temporal</hi> Protection, which good Men do receive from the <hi>holy Angels:</hi> But since those <hi>blessed</hi> and <hi>benigne</hi> Spirits are so much concerned in <hi>Humane Affairs,</hi> we cannot but suppose that, so far as their own Ability, and the Laws of the invisible World will permit them, they are ready to succour our <hi>Souls,</hi> as well as <hi>Bodies;</hi> and to contribute to our <hi>eternal,</hi> as well as <hi>temporal</hi> Interests; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering that of our Saviour, Luk. xv. 10. <hi>that there is joy in the presence of the Angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.</hi> And if they are so far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in our <hi>Repentance,</hi> as to <hi>rejoice</hi> in
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:34683:186"/>
it, to be sure they will and do <hi>promote</hi> it; since in so doing they contribute to their own <hi>Ioy</hi> Now the <hi>holy Angels,</hi> being the Ministers of the <hi>Divine Providence,</hi> have great Advantages of assisting us in our <hi>Duties,</hi> and serving the Interests of our <hi>Souls;</hi> which Advantages to be sure their own <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Benignity</hi> will prompt them to make the utmost Improvement of. They have many Opportunities to <hi>present</hi> good Objects to us, and to <hi>remove</hi> Temptations from us; of <hi>disciplining</hi> our Natures by <hi>Prosperities</hi> and <hi>Afflictions,</hi> and of <hi>ordering</hi> and <hi>varying</hi> our outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, so as to render our <hi>Duty</hi> more <hi>facile</hi> and <hi>easy</hi> to us. And besides, as they are <hi>Spirits,</hi> they have a very <hi>near</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar</hi> Access to our <hi>Souls;</hi> not that they can make any <hi>immediate Impressions</hi> upon our Understandings, or Wills, which is a Sphere of Light to which no <hi>created Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> can approach, but is under the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Oeconomy of the <hi>Father of Spirits:</hi> But yet being <hi>Spirits,</hi> I conceive, they may easily insinuate themselves into our <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> and mingle with the <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> of our Bodies; and by that means suggest <hi>good Thoughts</hi> to us, and raise <hi>holy Affections</hi> in us. For that they can work upon our <hi>Fancies</hi> is apparent; else there
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:34683:186"/>
could be neither <hi>Diabolical,</hi> nor <hi>Angelical</hi> Dreams: And if they can so act upon our <hi>Fancies,</hi> as to excite new <hi>Images</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations</hi> in them, they may by this means communicate new <hi>Thoughts</hi> to the <hi>Understanding;</hi> which naturally prints off from the <hi>Fancy</hi> all those Ideas, and Images which it sets and composes. And as they can work upon our <hi>Fansies,</hi> so they can also upon our <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Humours;</hi> else they have not the Power of <hi>curing,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting</hi> a Disease: And by thus working upon our <hi>Spirits,</hi> they can in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure <hi>moderate</hi> the Violence of our <hi>Passions;</hi> which are nothing but the <hi>flowings</hi> and <hi>reflowings</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> to and fro from the Heart: And by working upon our <hi>Humours</hi> they can compose us to such a <hi>sedate</hi> and <hi>serious Temper,</hi> as is most apt to receive <hi>religious Impressions,</hi> and to be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenc'd</hi> by the Motions of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> These things I doubt not but the <hi>blessed Angels</hi> can do, and many times do, though we <hi>perceive</hi> it not: And though possibly by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the World of <hi>Spirits</hi> they may be <hi>restrained</hi> from doing their <hi>utmost</hi> for us, that so we may still act with an uncontrouled <hi>Freedom,</hi> and be left under a Necessity of <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour; yet doubtless their <hi>Assistance</hi> is not wanting to us; but as the <hi>evil Angels</hi>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:34683:187"/>
are always ready to <hi>pervert</hi> and <hi>seduce</hi> us, so the <hi>good</hi> are no less ready to <hi>reform</hi> and <hi>recover</hi> us. And since whatsoever they do for us, they do as the <hi>Agents</hi> and <hi>Ministers</hi> of the <hi>Divine Spirits;</hi> whatsoever we do by their Assistance, we do by the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly and Lastly, LET us consider the <hi>internal</hi> Motions and Operations of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> upon our <hi>Souls.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all those Assistances which the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> vouchsafes to us by his <hi>Word,</hi> and his <hi>Providence,</hi> and his <hi>Holy Angels;</hi> he does also very powerfully <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>help</hi> us by his own <hi>immediate Motions,</hi> and <hi>Sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions.</hi> For that the Ministrations of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> have been always accompanied with the <hi>internal</hi> Operations of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> is evident from that <hi>miraculous</hi> Success that <hi>Religion</hi> hath found in the World: For I cannot imagine how <hi>Christianity,</hi> that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was beholding to <hi>humane Force</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> but instead of that found all the Powers of the World armed <hi>against</hi> it, and had so many mighty <hi>Prejudices</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, before ever it could be admitted to speak with Mens <hi>Reason;</hi> I say, I cannot imagine, how under such Circumstances it could have <hi>thriv'd</hi> and <hi>flourish'd</hi> as it did, had it not been accompanied with an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible Power,</hi> from <hi>above.</hi> For how did it
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:34683:187"/>
                  <hi>triumph</hi> in its very <hi>Infancy</hi> over all the Power and Malice of the World, growing like the <hi>Palm-tree</hi> by Depression, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering</hi> in the midst of <hi>Flames?</hi> What wonderful <hi>Alterations</hi> did it make in the <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> of Men, transforming in an instant the <hi>debauch'd</hi> and <hi>dissolute</hi> into Patterns of the strictest <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety,</hi> and with its mighty Charms turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Wolves</hi> into <hi>Lambs,</hi> and <hi>Vulturs</hi> into <hi>Tuttle-doves?</hi> Which wondrous effects were so very frequent, that the <hi>Heathens</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves took special notice of them; which, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells us, made them to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute its Success to the Power of <hi>Magick;</hi> thinking it impossible that it should do such Wonders, without the Assistance of some <hi>powerful Spirit.</hi> And indeed it is not to be supposed, how it should work such <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>suddain Alterations</hi> in Men, by its <hi>external</hi> Arguments and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, without a <hi>divine Power</hi> concurring with them and animating and enforcing them; and though now that <hi>Christianity</hi> hath gotten such footing in the World, and is become the Religion of <hi>Nations,</hi> the <hi>divine Spirit</hi> does not <hi>ordinarily</hi> work upon Men in such a <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> way; but proceeds in more <hi>humane</hi> Methods by joyning in with our <hi>Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings,</hi>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:34683:188"/>
and leading us forward by the Rules of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Sobriety;</hi> so that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Aids it affords us, they work in the <hi>same Way,</hi> and after the <hi>same Manner,</hi> as if all were performed by the Strength of our <hi>own Reason;</hi> yet we have a <hi>stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Promise</hi> which extends to all Ages of <hi>Christianity,</hi> that to him who <hi>improves</hi> the Grace which he hath already, <hi>more</hi> Grace shall be given; that if we <hi>work out our salvation with fear and trembling,</hi> God will work in us <hi>to will and to do;</hi> and that he will give his <hi>holy Spirit</hi> to every one that sincerely <hi>asks,</hi> and <hi>seeks</hi> it. For of the <hi>Performance</hi> of this <hi>Promise,</hi> there are none of us all but have had many <hi>sensible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences;</hi> for how often do we find <hi>good Thoughts</hi> injected into our Minds we know not <hi>how,</hi> nor <hi>whence?</hi> How frequently are we <hi>seiz'd</hi> with <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>vehement</hi> Convictions of the Folly and Danger of our own Wicked courses, even in the <hi>midst</hi> of our loose <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Iollity,</hi> when we are <hi>rock'd</hi> into a deep <hi>Security,</hi> when we have <hi>endeavour'd</hi> to <hi>chase</hi> good Thoughts from our Minds, or to <hi>drown</hi> them in <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality</hi> and <hi>Voluptuousness?</hi> How often have we been <hi>haunted</hi> with their <hi>Importunities,</hi> till we have been <hi>scar'd</hi> by them into so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Resolutions?</hi> And when we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:34683:188"/>
with them, what <hi>Ioys</hi> and <hi>Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> have we sometimes found in the Discharge of our <hi>Duty,</hi> to encourage us to <hi>Perseverance</hi> in Well-doing? All which are <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>sensible</hi> Instances of the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Operations of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> upon our Souls: So that when we comply with these <hi>inward</hi> Motions of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> so as to forsake those sins which they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade us from, we do then <hi>mortify the deeds of the body by the spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM the Consideration of these Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, many use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Inferences</hi> may be deduc'd: And First, From hence we may discern the Necessity of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to enable us to <hi>mortify</hi> the Deeds of the <hi>Body.</hi> And indeed consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Infirmity</hi> of our Natures, and the many <hi>Temptations</hi> we have to encounter, how we are <hi>habituated</hi> to a <hi>Sensual Life</hi> before we are capable of exercising our <hi>Reason,</hi> and how much our <hi>Wills</hi> are biass'd by our <hi>Carnal Inclinations;</hi> it is hardly to be imagined, how we should ever be able to retrieve our selves from the Power and Dominion of our own <hi>Lusts,</hi> without some <hi>supernatural</hi> Aid and Assistance. For tho' we have an <hi>Understanding</hi> capable of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> and of discerning all those <hi>Advantages</hi> and <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs</hi>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:34683:189"/>
that are inseparable unto <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>vicious</hi> Actions; though we have a <hi>Will</hi> that can comply with the Dictates of right Reason, and is no ways determined and necessitated to Evil; and though we <hi>can</hi> do whatsoever we will: Yet if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those Motives which arise out of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> we had not <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural</hi> Arguments to assist us, our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations</hi> would certainly prove too strong for our <hi>Reason.</hi> If the <hi>lascivious Wanton</hi> had no other Arguments to oppose against the Temptations of <hi>Lust,</hi> but that it vexes him with <hi>Impatience,</hi> fills him with mad and ungovernable <hi>Desires,</hi> torments him with <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Iealousie,</hi> betrays him into <hi>Sickness</hi> and <hi>Poverty,</hi> and the like; How can it be expected that such <hi>slender</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments should prevail against the Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of his <hi>depraved Appetite?</hi> If the <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous Oppressour</hi> had no other Motive to confront <hi>his Lust</hi> with, but that his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice exposes him to the Hatred of those whom he injures, and violates the Laws of Society, and consequently is destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of the Publick Good, in which his own is involved; alas! What <hi>thin</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments would these be to him, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison with the Temptations of a Bag of Gold? And though to these <hi>natural</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:34683:189"/>
God hath added sundry <hi>supernatural</hi> ones in the Revelation of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> such as are in <hi>themselves</hi> sufficient to check our most <hi>outragious Appetites,</hi> and to baffle the <hi>strongest Temptations;</hi> Yet alas! our <hi>Thoughts</hi> are so squander'd among this great Multiplicity of <hi>carnal</hi> Objects that surround us, that did not the <hi>Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> frequently suggest those <hi>supernatural</hi> Arguments to us, and by the powerful Influence of his <hi>Grace</hi> keep our Minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon them; we should never recollect our selves to such a <hi>thorough Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of them; as is necessary to persuade our selves by them into a <hi>lasting Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Amendment. So that we have very great need both of the <hi>outward,</hi> and <hi>inward</hi> Grace of God; for though we can <hi>deliberate</hi> what is best to <hi>choose,</hi> and <hi>choose</hi> what we find <hi>best</hi> upon Deliberation; yet we are like Men standing <hi>in bivio,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two contrary Roads, and are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally indeed free to turn either to the <hi>Right</hi> hand or to the <hi>Left;</hi> but on the <hi>Left-hand</hi> way there are so many <hi>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> perpetually beckoning to us, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viting us unto that which is <hi>Evil,</hi> and our brutish <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Appetites</hi> are so ready upon all occasions to yield and comply with them; that we should certainty go that way, did not the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:34683:190"/>
us with strong Arguments to turn to the <hi>Right-hand</hi> way of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. WE may learn from hence the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of our <hi>Concurrence</hi> with the <hi>Spirit,</hi> For the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God works upon us in such a way, as is most <hi>congruous</hi> to our <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Rational</hi> Natures; that is, it doth not act upon us by mere <hi>Force,</hi> or irresistible <hi>Power,</hi> but addresses to our <hi>Reason,</hi> with Arguments and Persuasions, and so moves upon our <hi>Wills</hi> by the Mediation of our <hi>Understandings:</hi> But when He hath done all, He leaves it to our own Choice whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will <hi>reject,</hi> or <hi>embrace</hi> his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals. For although I firmly believe, as no Man would be <hi>wicked,</hi> were he not invited by the Temptations of <hi>sin,</hi> so no Man would be <hi>good,</hi> were he not solicited by the <hi>Grace</hi> of God; yet I see no Reason to imagine, that either the <hi>one,</hi> or the <hi>other</hi> invades the Liberty of our <hi>Wills.</hi> The Temptations of <hi>Sin</hi> indeed incline us one way, and the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> another; but when all is done, they leave us <hi>free</hi> to <hi>choose</hi> or <hi>refuse,</hi> and neither the <hi>one</hi> nor the <hi>other</hi> forces or necessitates us. And hence the <hi>Successes</hi> of the <hi>Divine Grace</hi> are in Scripture attributed to the <hi>Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> or <hi>Indisposition</hi> of the Subject it acts upon: So <hi>Matth.</hi> xi. 20, 21. <hi>Then began</hi>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:34683:190"/>
                  <hi>he to upbraid the Cities, wherein his mighty works were done; woe unto thee Corazin, woe unto thee Bethsaida; for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</hi> From whence I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that <hi>that Grace</hi> which would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> was not <hi>irresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible;</hi> for if it had it would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida</hi> too: For how could they have resisted <hi>irresistible</hi> Grace? And why should it not have had the <hi>same</hi> Effect on the <hi>one,</hi> which it would have had on the <hi>other;</hi> had there not been something in the <hi>one</hi> which was not in the <hi>other,</hi> which did actually <hi>resist</hi> and <hi>van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish</hi> it? And so likewise in the Parable of the <hi>Seed</hi> sown in the <hi>High-way,</hi> the <hi>stony, thorny,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Ground, <hi>Matth.</hi> xiii. the Reason why the Seed prospered in <hi>some,</hi> and not in <hi>others,</hi> is plainly resolved into the <hi>different</hi> Condition of the <hi>Soil:</hi> for as for those that either considered not <hi>at all,</hi> or not <hi>enough,</hi> the Seed of the Divine Grace proved altogether <hi>ineffectual</hi> to them; but as for those who had so <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> consider'd its Proposals, as to form in their Minds a <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>settled</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, it produced in them a most <hi>fruitful</hi> Spring of <hi>Virtues</hi> and <hi>good Works.</hi> Which is a plain Argument that the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses</hi>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:34683:191"/>
of <hi>God's Grace</hi> depend upon the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence</hi> of our <hi>Endeavours</hi> with it; for had it wrought <hi>irresistibly</hi> upon these <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> Soils, it must have had the <hi>same Success</hi> in <hi>all.</hi> And indeed it is infinitely unreasonable to expect, that God should make us good <hi>irresistibly,</hi> without the <hi>free</hi> Concurrence of our own <hi>Will,</hi> and <hi>Endeavours;</hi> since by so doing he must offer <hi>Violence</hi> to the Frame of our Beings, and <hi>alter</hi> the established Course of our <hi>Natures;</hi> which consists in a <hi>free Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of our selves, according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of our own <hi>Reason.</hi> For that which is <hi>irresistible</hi> must <hi>necessitate</hi> the Subject upon which it acts; and therefore if we are <hi>impell'd</hi> to be <hi>good</hi> by a Power which we cannot <hi>resist,</hi> it is not in our Power to <hi>choose</hi> whether we will be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>no.</hi> Wherefore though God be infinitely <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous</hi> of our Happiness, and ready to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute</hi> whatsoever is necessary to promote it; yet he will not effect it by <hi>necessary</hi> Means and Causes, but in such a way only as is fairly consistent with the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> of our <hi>Wills:</hi> that is, he will not save us without <hi>our selves,</hi> whether we will or no; but take our <hi>free Consent</hi> and <hi>Endeavour</hi> along with him. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done all that is necessary to <hi>persuade</hi> us, he expects that we should <hi>consider</hi>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:34683:191"/>
what he saith, and upon <hi>that, consent</hi> to his gracious Proposals, and <hi>express</hi> this Consent in a constant Course of <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>vertuous Endeavours:</hi> and if we will not do <hi>this,</hi> we cannot be <hi>sav'd,</hi> unless God work a <hi>Miracle</hi> for us, and alters the Course of <hi>Nature;</hi> which is the <hi>great Law</hi> by which his Providence doth govern all the Beings in the World. And this we have no Reason to expect, either from the <hi>Goodness</hi> of <hi>God's Nature,</hi> or from any <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation</hi> he hath made to us: not from the <hi>Goodness</hi> of his <hi>Nature;</hi> for why is it not as consistent with <hi>that</hi> to <hi>govern</hi> us as free Agents, as to <hi>make</hi> us such? Not from any <hi>Revelation</hi> of his Will; for that indispensably exacts our free <hi>Concurrence</hi> with his <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Assistance,</hi> and requires us to make our selves a <hi>new Heart,</hi> to <hi>cleanse</hi> our selves <hi>from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,</hi> and to <hi>work out our own salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> 'Tis true, God is also said to <hi>work in us to will and to do,</hi> to <hi>create in us a new heart,</hi> and to <hi>create us in Iesus Christ unto good works:</hi> Which seemingly repugnant expressions can be no otherwise reconciled, but by supposing <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> to be <hi>Ioint-Causes</hi> contributing to the same <hi>Effect;</hi> so that where God speaks as if He did all, we
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:34683:192"/>
must suppose the <hi>Concurrence</hi> of <hi>our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours;</hi> and where he speaks as if We were to do all, we must suppose the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence</hi> of <hi>his</hi> own <hi>Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. WE may be assur'd from hence of the Certainty of <hi>Success,</hi> upon such a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence</hi> of our <hi>Endeavours</hi> with the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> which plainly implies the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the <hi>Spirit</hi> to Be within our <hi>Power,</hi> as being in an inseparable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with our <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>faithful</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. And that they are so, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; for as for the <hi>outward</hi> Assistances of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> which are the powerful Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Motives of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> we have them always at <hi>hand,</hi> and may make use of them when we <hi>please;</hi> we have a free Access to this <hi>divine Armoury,</hi> and may at any time furnish our selves with <hi>sufficient Weapons</hi> to assoil the most formidable <hi>Temptations:</hi> And as for the <hi>inward</hi> Aids of the blessed <hi>Spirit,</hi> God by his own free <hi>Promise</hi> hath inseparably entailed them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> Endeavours. Thus he hath promised to give his <hi>grace</hi> to those who <hi>humble</hi> themselves, and to <hi>draw nigh</hi> unto them who <hi>submit</hi> themselves to him: <hi>Iam.</hi> iv. 6, 7, 8. and <hi>unto every one that hath,</hi> that is, improveth what he hath, he hath promised <hi>it shall be given</hi> and that <hi>he</hi>
                  <pb n="357" facs="tcp:34683:192"/>
                  <hi>shall have abundance:</hi> xxv. <hi>Matth.</hi> 29. and to every one that <hi>asketh</hi> sincerely and honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he hath promised to <hi>give his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> Luk. xi. 13. And thus by his own free <hi>Promise</hi> he hath tied <hi>his</hi> Spirit to <hi>our</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, so that we may have his Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance when we <hi>please;</hi> he being confined by his own <hi>Promise</hi> to be ready at our <hi>Call,</hi> and to come in to the Aid of our <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,</hi> whensoever we shall <hi>need</hi> and <hi>ask</hi> his Assistance. And having such a powerful <hi>Second</hi> engaged in our Quarrel, what Reason have we to doubt of <hi>Success</hi> and <hi>Victory?</hi> For what <hi>Lust</hi> is there so strong that we may not <hi>subdue?</hi> What <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi> so inveterate, that we may not <hi>conquer?</hi> What <hi>Temptation</hi> so powerful that we may not <hi>repulse,</hi> whose endeavours are thus <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded</hi> with Almighty Aids from above? For now whatsoever the <hi>Divine Spirit</hi> can do in us, <hi>we</hi> can do; because we can do that, which being done, will infallibly <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige</hi> him to <hi>concur</hi> with us: And though we cannot conquer our <hi>Lusts</hi> in our own <hi>single</hi> Strength, yet we can by our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours engage <hi>him</hi> on our <hi>side,</hi> who is both <hi>able</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to enable <hi>us</hi> to conquer them. So that if we <hi>will,</hi> we may be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible;</hi> and there is no <hi>Temptation</hi> can be too <hi>strong</hi> for us, if we do not by our
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:34683:193"/>
own <hi>Sloth,</hi> and <hi>Cowardice</hi> disingage the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Spirit</hi> from assisting us.</p>
               <p>IV. FROM hence we may perceive how much Reason there is for our <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Supplications</hi> to God; since it is so apparent that our <hi>Victory</hi> over <hi>Sin,</hi> and consequently our <hi>eternal Welfare</hi> doth so much depend upon the Aids and Assistances of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and since God is so ready to <hi>give</hi> his <hi>holy Spirit</hi> to us, whensoever we sincerely <hi>ask</hi> and <hi>desire</hi> it. Now the great <hi>Reason</hi> of Prayer is <hi>Want,</hi> and the greatest <hi>Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement</hi> to it is <hi>Assurance</hi> of Supply; but there is nothing in the world that we have more <hi>Need</hi> of, and (if we faithfully seek it) nothing that we can have more <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance</hi> of, than the gracious Influence of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> We have as much Need of it, as of our daily <hi>Bread;</hi> because our Souls will <hi>starve</hi> and <hi>famish</hi> without it: And we have as much Assurance of it, as the sacred Word of the <hi>God of Truth</hi> can give us; because He hath promised it to us who can as soon cease to <hi>be,</hi> as to be <hi>faithful:</hi> And therefore if after so much <hi>Need</hi> and <hi>Encouragement,</hi> we do neglect our <hi>Prayers,</hi> and turn our backs upon the Throne of <hi>Grace;</hi> it is a plain Argument, that either we are wretchedly <hi>insensible</hi> of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:34683:193"/>
our <hi>Need</hi> of God's Grace, or causelesly <hi>suspicious</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> of his Promise. And doubtless he that can pass day after day without putting up one <hi>Prayer</hi> to Heaven, that can <hi>venture</hi> himself among the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Snares</hi> and <hi>Temptations</hi> of this world, without imploring the Divine <hi>Aid</hi> and <hi>Protection,</hi> is a very <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>fool-hardy</hi> Sinner; one that declares he regards nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>God,</hi> nor his own <hi>Soul,</hi> and that he cares not what becomes of him either <hi>here,</hi> or <hi>hereafter.</hi> Methinks did we but so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly consider how much we <hi>want</hi> God's Grace, and how <hi>ready</hi> He is to afford it us; we should as soon venture to rush <hi>naked</hi> into a Battle among Squadrons of Swords and Spears, as to go at any time into the World without <hi>God,</hi> to hazard our immortal <hi>Souls</hi> in the midst of such a numberless Battle of <hi>Temptations,</hi> without arming our selves by <hi>Prayer</hi> with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Grace</hi> and Assistance. Wherefore since we have so much <hi>Need,</hi> and (if we seek it) so much <hi>Assurance</hi> too of the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of God; let us take that excellent Counsel of the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Heb. iv. 16. <hi>Go boldly</hi> and importunately <hi>to the Throne of Grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help us in the time of need<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>
                  <pb n="360" facs="tcp:34683:194"/>V. FROM hence we may perceive the indispensable <hi>Necessity</hi> of our faithful and sincere Endeavours, in order to the <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying</hi> our <hi>Lusts.</hi> 'Tis a strange Principle which some Men have taken up, that if their Names are <hi>recorded</hi> in the eternal Roll of <hi>Election,</hi> they shall in time be made good by an <hi>irresistible Grace;</hi> and that if they are <hi>not,</hi> they shall <hi>never</hi> be good at all, though they should <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> it with their utmost, <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence:</hi> And so they think, their best way is to <hi>lye still</hi> in the Harbour, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Event; concluding it in vain to begin their Voyage towards Heaven, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an <hi>irresistible</hi> Gale from thence. A Doctrine which I doubt too many Men have improved to their own <hi>everlasting Ruin;</hi> though it hath no Foundation at all in <hi>Reason,</hi> and hath nothing to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it self, but a few <hi>mistaken</hi> Phrases of Scripture. But he that shall impartially consult the whole <hi>Current</hi> of God's Word, will find that the ordinary Language and Sense of it is this; that God <hi>desireth not the death of a sinner,</hi> but <hi>would have all men to be saved;</hi> but because he would save us in such a Way as is congruous to <hi>free Agents,</hi> and not by <hi>fatal</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> Means, therefore he indispensably exacts
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:34683:194"/>
the Concurrence of our <hi>Endeavours;</hi> that we should <hi>run the Race that is set before us,</hi> and <hi>strive to enter into the strait gate,</hi> and that by <hi>patient continuance in well-doing we should seek for honour and glory and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</hi> And from any thing that God hath said to us, we have as much Reason to hope to be <hi>nourish'd</hi> without <hi>Eating,</hi> as to be <hi>sav'd</hi> without <hi>Endeavour.</hi> 'Tis true, God hath promised by his Grace to <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate</hi> with us, to <hi>joyn</hi> in with our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and <hi>bless</hi> our virtuous Essays; but he is by no means obliged to <hi>work</hi> for us, while we sit <hi>idle;</hi> to <hi>mortify</hi> our Lusts while we <hi>feed</hi> and <hi>pamper</hi> them; or to <hi>purify</hi> our Minds, while we go on to <hi>pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> them with all the <hi>Filthiness</hi> of the Flesh and Spirit. No; if we would that God should <hi>assist</hi> us, we must do what we <hi>can</hi> for our selves: We can attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ordinary <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Ministries</hi> of Salvation, we can <hi>ponder</hi> and <hi>consider</hi> the great <hi>Motives</hi> of our Religion, and <hi>abstain</hi> at least from the <hi>outward</hi> Acts of Sin, and <hi>implore</hi> the Divine Aid to prosper and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed our Endeavours: And if we will do but this, and what else is in our <hi>Power,</hi> let us then blame God, if we are not suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful; and if we die in our <hi>Sins,</hi> let us charge his <hi>Decrees</hi> with our <hi>Ruine.</hi> But if
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:34683:195"/>
we will disregard the <hi>publick Ministries</hi> of Religion, and wilfully excommunicate all <hi>good Thoughts</hi> from our minds; if we will comply with every <hi>Temptation</hi> to sin, and refuse to crave <hi>Assistance</hi> from Heaven against it; we have none to blame for our <hi>Ruin</hi> but <hi>our selves.</hi> For God hath told us before-hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>He</hi> will not <hi>save</hi> us without <hi>our selves;</hi> and therefore he that is to go a long Journey, hath as much Reason to sit down in hope to be snatched up into the Air by Whirlwind, and so to be carried on the wings of it to his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Stage; as we have to neglect our <hi>Endeavours</hi> for Heaven, in expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation to be haled and snatched up thither, by the Almighty <hi>Pulleys</hi> of an <hi>irresistible</hi> Grace. Let us not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon this <hi>vain Presumption</hi> sit still any longer with our hands in our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soms, lest we <hi>perish</hi> in our Sloth, and expose our own Souls to <hi>everlasting Ruin,</hi> by an <hi>idle</hi> Expectation of being <hi>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistibly</hi> saved.</p>
               <p>VI. FROM hence we may discern the <hi>Possibility</hi> of keeping the Commands of God, in that God by his <hi>Spirit</hi> doth so powerfully <hi>aid</hi> and <hi>assist</hi> us. For sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing we cannot keep the Divine Law
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:34683:195"/>
by our own <hi>single Strength</hi> and Power, yet it is apparent that we can do <hi>that</hi> which will <hi>oblige</hi> the Divine Spirit to <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>enable</hi> us to keep it; that is, we can do our <hi>Endeavour,</hi> which being done, entitles us to the <hi>Promise</hi> of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, and Assistance. And though we cannot do all <hi>our selves,</hi> yet since we can do so much as will certainly oblige <hi>God</hi> to impower us to do the <hi>rest;</hi> it is already in our Power to do <hi>all,</hi> if we will. He that is strong enough to carry a Burthen of an hundred weight, but is required to carry two, may carry <hi>both;</hi> supposing that by bearing as much as he <hi>can,</hi> he shall certainly be <hi>enabled</hi> to carry the <hi>whole.</hi> Now God hath promised us by the Assistances of <hi>his Grace,</hi> whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is wanting in the Power of <hi>our</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and therefore if we fall short of our <hi>Duty,</hi> and consequently of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> of it, we can reasonably blame no one but <hi>our selves.</hi> For though we <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> do all in our <hi>own</hi> Strength, yet that we <hi>do</hi> not do all, is as much our Fault, as if we <hi>could;</hi> since we <hi>may</hi> do all through <hi>Christ,</hi> who would strengthen us, would we but do what we <hi>can.</hi> Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no longer cry out of the <hi>Impossibility</hi> of God's Commands, nor charge our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:34683:196"/>
to them upon the <hi>unavoidable Weakness</hi> of our own Natures; since it is so plain, that our Sin is resolveable into no other Principle, but our own wretched <hi>Wilfulness</hi> and <hi>Obstinacy.</hi> But let us betake our selves to a <hi>serious</hi> and <hi>hearty Endeavour</hi> of doing our Master's Will; and if when we have done all that we <hi>can,</hi> we should then fall short of our <hi>Duty,</hi> and miss the <hi>Reward</hi> of it; we may then with good Reason call him an <hi>austere Man,</hi> for imposing <hi>tyrannical</hi> and <hi>impossible</hi> Commands, and expecting to <hi>reap where he hath not sown.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly and Lastly, WE may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from hence the <hi>Inexcusableness</hi> of Sinners, if they go on in their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For God, you see, doth vouchsafe to us such <hi>plentiful</hi> Measures of his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Assistance;</hi> that in the Strength of it we <hi>may</hi> mortify our Lusts if we <hi>will,</hi> and work out our own <hi>eternal Salvation:</hi> but if we will be <hi>negligent,</hi> and rather <hi>choose</hi> to <hi>perish</hi> in our Sin, than take the <hi>pains</hi> to subdue it by the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, our Folly is <hi>inexcusable;</hi> and no one can be charged with our <hi>Ruin,</hi> but <hi>our selves.</hi> For what could God have done <hi>more</hi> for us, than he hath already done? He hath <hi>solicited</hi> us to forsake our Sin with
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:34683:196"/>
the most important <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi> tempted our <hi>Hopes</hi> with a Heaven of <hi>immortal Ioys,</hi> and alarmed our <hi>Fears</hi> with the Horrors of an <hi>endless</hi> and <hi>into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Damnation;</hi> so that we cannot go on in our Sin without <hi>leaping</hi> over Heaven into Hell, and <hi>wading</hi> through an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Ocean of Happiness into the Lake of Fire and Brimstone. He hath plainly told us, what the <hi>Event</hi> and <hi>Issue</hi> of our Folly will be; and <hi>warn'd</hi> us before-hand that if we will be <hi>wicked,</hi> we must be <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable:</hi> So that if after <hi>this</hi> we do go on in our Sin, we run our selves upon a <hi>foreseen</hi> Damnation, and leap into Hell with our <hi>Eyes open.</hi> He hath promised, that if we will seriously <hi>attempt</hi> our own Recovery, his <hi>Grace</hi> shall be <hi>sufficient</hi> for us, to back our <hi>Endeavours</hi> and crown them with <hi>Success:</hi> So that if after <hi>this</hi> we do persist in our Folly, we choose <hi>Destruction,</hi> and rush headlong into a <hi>Ruin</hi> which we might easily avoid. In a word, he hath again and again suggested <hi>good Thoughts</hi> to our Minds, and by an importunate <hi>Iteration</hi> of them hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>courted</hi> us to <hi>repent,</hi> and <hi>live:</hi> So that if still we persevere in our <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence,</hi> we stop our Ears to the Addresses of <hi>Heaven;</hi> and do in effect tell God,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:34683:197"/>
that we will not <hi>hearken</hi> to him, though our <hi>Souls</hi> are at stake, and 'tis no less than an <hi>everlasting</hi> Ruin that he dissuades us from. And what <hi>Remedy,</hi> or <hi>Excuse</hi> is there for such <hi>intolerable</hi> Obstinacy? So that it is a plain Case, God hath done so <hi>much</hi> for us, that there is not any thing <hi>wanting</hi> to our everlasting Salvation, but only our <hi>own Wills;</hi> and if we will not comply with his <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Assistance,</hi> he will not save us whether we <hi>will</hi> or <hi>no.</hi> So that when <hi>Inquisition</hi> shall be made for the Blood of our <hi>Souls,</hi> the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most we can charge God with, is this; that he did not tie up our hands, to keep us from murdering our selves, with the Cords of an <hi>irresistible</hi> Fate; and by his <hi>invincible</hi> Power drag us to Heaven, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we would or no. But if we have so little Regard of <hi>our selves,</hi> as to <hi>spurn</hi> at our own <hi>Happiness,</hi> it is not fit that God should <hi>force</hi> it upon us; and it would be a <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> Condescension in him, to <hi>prostitute</hi> the Rewards of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to those that wilfully <hi>refuse</hi> them. Wherefore if we <hi>perish</hi> in our Sin, after God hath done so <hi>much</hi> for us; he may fairly wash his Hands in <hi>Innocency</hi> over us, and charge our Blood upon our <hi>own heads:</hi> And how deplorable soever our
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:34683:197"/>
Condition proves in the future State, <hi>God's Iustice</hi> will triumph for ever in our <hi>Ruin;</hi> and our own <hi>Consciences,</hi> in Consort with all the <hi>Rational</hi> World, will pronounce him to be most <hi>just and righteous in all his ways.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="368" facs="tcp:34683:198"/>I. BECAUSE the <hi>Law</hi> of our <hi>Natures</hi> hath not a <hi>sufficient</hi> Sanction without it. That there is in us such a <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> by which Things and Actions are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil;</hi> is every whit as evident, as that we have within us a Principle of <hi>Reason.</hi> For no Man using his <hi>Reason</hi> can ever think it indifferent in it self, whether we obey our <hi>Parents,</hi> or contemn them; whether we lye, or speak <hi>Truth;</hi> whether we be grateful, or disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous to our <hi>Benefactors:</hi> For between these Things there is such an <hi>essential Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,</hi> that they can never be <hi>equal</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors to a <hi>Rational</hi> Approbation. And accordingly among all Mankind we may observe, that there are some <hi>Vices,</hi> which have as much the <hi>universal</hi> Judgment of <hi>Reason</hi> against them, as any false Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the <hi>Mathematicks;</hi> and some <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi> whose Goodness has been as <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally</hi> acknowledged, as the Truth of any Principle in <hi>Philosophy.</hi> Wherefore since God hath created us with such a <hi>Faculty,</hi> as doth necessarily make such a <hi>Iudgment</hi> of Good and Evil; this <hi>Iudgment</hi> must be <hi>God's,</hi> as well as the <hi>Faculties</hi> which made it: And that which is <hi>God's Iudgment</hi> in us, must necessarily be a <hi>Law</hi> to us. God therefore having put such a <hi>Law</hi> into our
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:34683:198"/>
                  <hi>Natures;</hi> we cannot but suppose, that he hath taken Care to enforce the <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it, by <hi>rewarding</hi> and <hi>punishing</hi> us, according as we <hi>obey,</hi> or <hi>violate</hi> it: For without the Sanctions of <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,</hi> to induce Men to observe them, <hi>Laws</hi> are insignificant; and that Lawgiver doth but <hi>petition</hi> his Subjects to obey, that doth not promise such <hi>Rewards,</hi> nor denounce such <hi>Penalties,</hi> as are <hi>sufficient</hi> to oblige them to it. And no <hi>Reward</hi> can be <hi>sufficient</hi> to oblige us to <hi>obey,</hi> that doth not abundantly <hi>compensate</hi> any <hi>Loss,</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> we may sustain by our <hi>Obedience;</hi> no <hi>Punishment sufficient</hi> to deter us from <hi>disobeying,</hi> that doth not far surmount all that <hi>Benefit,</hi> or <hi>Pleasure</hi> we can hope to reap from our <hi>Disobedience.</hi> Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath implanted a <hi>Law</hi> in our <hi>Natures,</hi> we must either suppose, that he hath not <hi>sufficiently</hi> secured it by <hi>Rewards,</hi> and <hi>Punishments;</hi> which is to blaspheme his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Conduct:</hi> Or else we must acknowledge, that he hath established it with such <hi>Rewards,</hi> and <hi>Punishments,</hi> as do make it far more adviseable to <hi>obey,</hi> than to <hi>transgress</hi> it; which that he hath done in <hi>all</hi> Instances, can never be proved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out granting the <hi>Rewards,</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> of <hi>another</hi> World. For if there be no

Now though it is certain, that in the general there is a <hi>natural Good</hi> accruing to us from all <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> Actions, as on the contrary a <hi>natural Evil</hi> from all <hi>vicious</hi> ones; and it is ordinarily more conducive for our <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> Interests to <hi>obey,</hi> than to <hi>disobey</hi> the great Law of our Natures: Yet there are a world of Instances, wherein <hi>Vice</hi> may be more advantageous to us than <hi>Virtue,</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting from the <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> of <hi>another</hi> World. It is <hi>ordinarily</hi> better for me to be an <hi>honest</hi> Man, than a <hi>Knave;</hi> it is more for my <hi>Reputation,</hi> yea, and usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for my <hi>Profit</hi> too; and it is more for the <hi>publick</hi> Good, in which my <hi>own</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved: But yet <hi>pro hic &amp; nunc</hi> it may be better for me, with respect only to <hi>this</hi> World, to be a <hi>Knave,</hi> than an <hi>honest</hi> man.

the Publick; it will be doubtless more advantageous for me, as to my <hi>worldly</hi> Interest, to <hi>cheat</hi> than to be <hi>honest.</hi> And how often such fair <hi>Opportunities</hi> of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zenage do occur, no Man can be insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that hath but the least Insight into the Affairs of the World. So that if God had not reserved <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> for us in <hi>another</hi> World, we should not have <hi>sufficient Motives</hi> universally to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve that great Law of Righteousness, which he hath given us: For whensoever we could cheat, or steal <hi>securely,</hi> it would be highly reasonable for us to do it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thereby we might promote our own <hi>temporal</hi> Happiness, which would be the <hi>only</hi> End we should have to pursue. And the same may be said of all <hi>other Laws</hi> of Nature, which without the great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of a <hi>future Happiness</hi> and <hi>Misery,</hi> could no longer induce any reasonable Man to obey them, than it is for his <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral</hi> Interest to do so. For suppose I can <hi>secretly</hi> stab, or poison a Man, whom I hate or dread, or from whose Death I may reap any considerable <hi>Advantage:</hi> What should <hi>restrain</hi> me from such a barbarous Fact? If you say, the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> pray what <hi>Reward</hi> doth the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture propose <hi>sufficient</hi> to compensate the
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:34683:200"/>
                  <hi>Dissatisfaction</hi> of my Revenge, or the <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> I run in suffering my Enemy to live? Or what <hi>Punishment</hi> doth the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture denounce, that is <hi>sufficient</hi> to balance the <hi>Advantage</hi> of a thousand or ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Pounds a year, that may accrue to me by his Death? If you say, the Law of Nature proposeth to me the <hi>Reward</hi> of a <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>satisfied</hi> Mind, if I forbear; and denounces the Punishment of a <hi>guilty</hi> and <hi>amazed</hi> Conscience, if I commit the Murder: I easily answer, that this <hi>Peace,</hi> or <hi>Horror,</hi> which is consequent to the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, or Commission of Murder, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises from the Hope, and Dread of <hi>future Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments;</hi> which being taken away, to murder or not murder will be <hi>indifferent,</hi> as to any <hi>Peace</hi> or <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> that will follow upon it: And this being removed, what Consideration will there be left <hi>sufficient</hi> to <hi>restrain</hi> me from the bloody Fact, when I have an Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to act it <hi>securely,</hi> and am furiously spurred on to it by my own <hi>Revenge</hi> and <hi>Covetousness?</hi> So that if there be no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> in <hi>another</hi> Life, to enforce the Commands of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it is apparent, that no such <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> or <hi>Punishments</hi> are annexed to it in <hi>this</hi> Life, as are <hi>universally sufficient</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:34683:200"/>
Men to observe it. And is it likely, that the <hi>All-wise Governour</hi> of the World would ever impose a <hi>Law</hi> under an <hi>insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Sanction?</hi> That he would ever give out his <hi>Commands</hi> to his Creatures, and then leave it <hi>indifferent</hi> to them whether they will <hi>obey</hi> him, or <hi>no?</hi> As he must needs have done, if in all circumstances it be not <hi>far better</hi> for us to <hi>obey</hi> him, than to <hi>disobey</hi> him. And if our <hi>Nature</hi> is so framed, as not to be effectually persuaded to <hi>Obedience,</hi> without the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of <hi>everlasting Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> it is at least <hi>highly credible,</hi> that there are such: Because it would be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi> of God, so to frame the Nature of one of his <hi>noblest Creatures,</hi> as to render it incapable of being governed by him without <hi>Falshood</hi> and <hi>Deceit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. THAT there is a <hi>future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> reserved for Good Men in the <hi>other</hi> World, is highly probable from those <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires</hi> and <hi>Expectations</hi> of it, which do so <hi>generally</hi> and <hi>naturally</hi> arise in <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> Minds. We rarely, if ever, read of any vertuous Man of whatsoever Nation, or Religion, or Sect of Philosophers, whose Mind hath not been wing'd with earnest Hopes and Desires of <hi>future Happiness;</hi> and I know none that have ever <hi>denied,</hi>
                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:34683:201"/>
or <hi>despaired</hi> of it, but only such as have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> and <hi>vitiated</hi> the Principles of their own Nature. Such were the <hi>Sadducees</hi> and <hi>Epicureans,</hi> Sects that had drowned all that was <hi>humane</hi> in them in <hi>Sensuality</hi> and <hi>Voluptuousness,</hi> and are brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Record for their shameful Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to their own <hi>brutish Genius:</hi> And such are no <hi>Standards</hi> of Humane Nature, but ought rather to be looked upon as <hi>Monsters</hi> of Men; and therefore as we do not think it <hi>natural</hi> to Men, to be born with six Fingers upon one Hand, though there have been many such <hi>monstrous</hi> and <hi>unnatural</hi> Births; so neither ought we to judge either of what is <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> to Men, by those <hi>humane Brutes,</hi> who by their perpetual wallowing in the <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> have monstrously <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured</hi> their own Natures, and <hi>dissolved</hi> all that Reason, by which they are consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted <hi>Men,</hi> into a mere <hi>sensual</hi> Sagacity of catering for the Appetites of the <hi>Flesh.</hi> If we would know therefore what is <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> to us, we must take our Measures from those who are <hi>least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved,</hi> and are most conformable to the Laws of a <hi>Rational Nature;</hi> who have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served the <hi>natural</hi> Subordination of their <hi>Faculties,</hi> and reduced their <hi>Passions</hi> and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:34683:201"/>
                  <hi>Appetites</hi> under the Empire of their <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:</hi> And these are the Men whom we call <hi>vertuous,</hi> and who because they live in the Exercise of those <hi>noble Virtues</hi> which are proper to us <hi>Men,</hi> are to be looked upon as the <hi>Standards</hi> of Humane Nature: by whom alone we can judge of what is <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>unnatural</hi> to us. Now <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> and the Desires and Hopes of <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> are so near allyed, that like <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>'s Twins, they live and die toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For though while Men live a <hi>bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish</hi> and <hi>sensual</hi> Life, their future <hi>Hopes</hi> are usually drowned in their present <hi>Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;</hi> yet when once they recover out of this <hi>unnatural</hi> State, and begin to live vertuously like <hi>reasonable</hi> Beings, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately they feel great Desires and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations of a <hi>future Happiness,</hi> springing up in their Minds, and arising higher and higher, proportionably as their Progress is in <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>true Goodness.</hi> Which is a plain Evidence, that these <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Desires</hi> are <hi>natural</hi> to us; and that they are interwoven by the great Creator in the Frame and Constitution of our <hi>Souls.</hi> Now how can it consist with the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God, to implant such <hi>Desires</hi> and <hi>Hopes</hi> in our Natures, and then to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from them the only <hi>Object</hi> that can
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:34683:202"/>
suit and satisfie them? As if it were a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation to him, to sit above in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and behold the <hi>Work of his Hands</hi> spending it self in <hi>weary Strugglings</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and <hi>gasping</hi> all the while it continues in Being, after an Happiness it shall never enjoy? As for other Beings, we see they have no <hi>natural</hi> Desire in vain; the good God having so ordered things, that there are <hi>Objects</hi> in Nature apportioned to all their <hi>natural</hi> Appetites: but if there be no State of <hi>Happiness</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for good Men in the <hi>other</hi> World, we are by a <hi>natural Principle</hi> most strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclined to that which we can <hi>never</hi> attain to. As if God had purposely fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with such Inclinations, that we might be perpetually <hi>tormented</hi> between those two Passions <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>Despair,</hi> an earnest <hi>Propension</hi> after a future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and an utter <hi>Incapacity</hi> of ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying it: as if <hi>Nature</hi> it self, whereby all <hi>other</hi> Beings are disposed to their <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> did serve only in <hi>Mankind</hi> to make them <hi>miserable,</hi> and which is more considerable, as if <hi>Virtue</hi> which is the <hi>Perfection</hi> of Nature, did only contribute to our <hi>Infelicity,</hi> by raising in us <hi>Desires</hi> and <hi>Expectations,</hi> which without a <hi>future</hi> Happiness must be for ever <hi>baffled</hi> and
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:34683:202"/>
                  <hi>disappointed.</hi> For if there be no future Happiness, either we <hi>may</hi> know it, or we may <hi>not,</hi> if we may <hi>not</hi> know it, why should we think <hi>that,</hi> which reflects so much Dishonor upon God, <hi>viz.</hi> that he hath created in us Desires and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, only to <hi>mock</hi> and <hi>tantalize</hi> them? But if we <hi>may</hi> know it, then do these Desires and Expectations seem to be created in us on purpose to <hi>torment</hi> us. For, for what other End can we desire to be <hi>eternally happy,</hi> who are only brought forth into the Light to be e'er long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished, and shut up in everlasting Darkness? The Consideration of which must needs be an exceeding Torture and <hi>Affliction</hi> to us.</p>
               <p>III. THAT there is a <hi>future Happiness</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for good Men, is evident from the <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Equity</hi> of the Divine Providence. That God is a most <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, is acknowledged by all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is a God, and that he <hi>rules</hi> and <hi>governs</hi> the World: and if it be so, then his <hi>Iustice</hi> must first or last discover it self in distributing <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to men, according as they <hi>obey,</hi> or <hi>violate</hi> the Laws of his Government. For what <hi>Iustice</hi> can he express in governing the World, if he rules at <hi>random;</hi> if he
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:34683:203"/>
never makes any <hi>Difference</hi> between the Good and the Bad, but rewards and punishes his Subjects <hi>promiscuously,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>Distinction</hi> between the Loyal and Rebellious? And yet in the <hi>ordinary Course</hi> of Divine Providence in <hi>this</hi> world, we see little or no <hi>Distinction</hi> made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; but as the <hi>Wise Man</hi> hath observed, <hi>Eccl.</hi> ix. 2. <hi>All things come alike to all,</hi> so that he cannot know God's <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Hatred</hi> by any thing that is before us: nay, many times we see the <hi>wicked,</hi> as the Psalmist describes them, flourishing <hi>like a green Bay-tree,</hi> Psal. xxxvii. 35. whilst the <hi>righteous</hi> are sorely <hi>oppressed,</hi> and <hi>crushed</hi> under the triumphal Chariots of their barbarous Enemies. So that were there no other State of things, but what we <hi>see</hi> before us; it would be impossible for us, to give any tolerable Account of the <hi>just Retributions</hi> of the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. For if when we have all acted our Parts upon this <hi>Stage</hi> of Time, we were to <hi>lye down</hi> together, and <hi>sleep</hi> for ever in the Dust; how many millions of <hi>Good Men</hi> are there that have thought nothing too <hi>dear</hi> for God, and have not only sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed their <hi>Lusts,</hi> but their <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Fortunes</hi> to his Service, who would have no other Recompence for so doing, but a
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:34683:203"/>
                  <hi>miserable</hi> Life, and a <hi>woful</hi> Death, and an <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>dishonourable</hi> Grave? And on the contrary, how many millions of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of <hi>Wicked Men</hi> are there, whose whole Lives have been nothing but one continued Act of <hi>Rebellion</hi> against God, who have <hi>blasphemed</hi> his Honour, and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted</hi> his Authority, and openly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned</hi> all the Laws of his Government; and yet would undergoe no other <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for so doing, but only to live <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperously,</hi> to die <hi>quietly,</hi> and then to be <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously</hi> enshrined in Monuments of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? And can we think <hi>this,</hi> and at the same time believe, that there is a <hi>righteous Providence</hi> which superintends the Affairs of the World? Certainly if not to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern this <hi>material</hi> World, and to put things into such a <hi>regular Course</hi> as may be suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Natures, and the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for which they are designed, would argue some Defect of <hi>Wisdom</hi> in God; then doubtless not to compensate <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> and adjust things suitably to their Qualifications; but thus crosly to couple <hi>Prosperity</hi> with <hi>Vice,</hi> and <hi>Misery</hi> with <hi>Virtue,</hi> would argue him deficient both in <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Iustice.</hi> And perhaps it would be no less expedient, with <hi>Epicurus</hi> to deny all <hi>Providence,</hi> than
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:34683:204"/>
to ascribe to it such <hi>Defects;</hi> it being less unworthy of the Divine Nature to <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> the Universe altogether, than to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister humane Affairs with so much <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice</hi> and <hi>Irregularity.</hi> So that either we must deny <hi>Providence,</hi> or (which is worse) deny the <hi>Iustice</hi> of it; or believe that there is a <hi>future State,</hi> wherein all things shall be adjusted, and <hi>good</hi> Men crowned with the <hi>Rewards</hi> of their Obedience, and the <hi>Wicked</hi> undergo the <hi>Punishment</hi> of their own Follies. For this we are sure of, that the Judge of all the World will do <hi>righteously;</hi> and that first or last he will distribute his <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> according to the <hi>Merit</hi> and <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> of his Subjects: and therefore because we see he doth not ordinarily do it in <hi>this</hi> World, we have great Reason to conclude, that he will do it effectually in the World <hi>to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly and Lastly, THAT there is a State of <hi>future Happiness</hi> prepared for <hi>good</hi> Men, is evident from the <hi>Revelation</hi> of his Will, which God hath made to us by <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> And this, I confess, is the most <hi>concluding</hi> Argument of all: as for the former Arguments, they render the Case so highly <hi>probable,</hi> that this at least must be acknowledged, that we have far
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:34683:204"/>
more Reason to <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>expect</hi> a <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Happiness,</hi> than we have to <hi>doubt</hi> or <hi>despair</hi> of it: but as for this last, it puts all out of <hi>Question,</hi> and leaves us no Pretence of Reason why we should <hi>doubt</hi> or <hi>suspect</hi> it. For <hi>eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> is the great Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing which our Saviour hath promised us, to encourage us to <hi>Perseverance</hi> in Well-doing; and in that <hi>everlasting Gospel</hi> which he preached to the World, he hath in the name of God proposed to us a Heaven of endless Joys and Felicities, and <hi>brought life and immortality to light.</hi> So that if he were <hi>commissioned</hi> from <hi>God</hi> to make this great Proposal to Mankind, we have as much <hi>Security</hi> of a future Happiness, as we can have of the <hi>Truth</hi> of God; which is the Foundation of all the <hi>Certainty</hi> we have, whether in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy or Divinity. Now that he was <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned</hi> from God to promise what he did to us is apparent, because God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by sundry Voices from Heaven <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi> him to be his Embassador to the World; and proclaimed him <hi>his beloved Son in whom he was well pleased,</hi> and whom he had substituted the <hi>Supream Minister</hi> of his Grace and Goodness to Mankind: and what he declared in <hi>Words,</hi> he also
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:34683:205"/>
demonstrated in <hi>Deeds.</hi> For when Christ was baptized, God sent down his <hi>holy Spirit</hi> upon him in a bright shining Flame, which spreading it self round his Head encircled his Brows, like a Crown of Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams, and remained upon him: which <hi>glorious Appearance</hi> answering to that <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Glory,</hi> by which God appeared from between the Cherubim, declared him to be the Temple of God, in whom the <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Godhead dwelt bodily,</hi> and in which he meant to take his Residence for ever. And accordingly after this visible <hi>Shechinah,</hi> or Glory disappeared, we find most <hi>palpable</hi> and <hi>apparent</hi> Signs of the Presence of <hi>God</hi> in him; for by this it was that he cured the <hi>Sick,</hi> and calmed the <hi>Seas,</hi> and raised the <hi>dead,</hi> and wrought all those <hi>wondrous Works</hi> by which he proved his Mission from above. For so we are told, that the <hi>went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the Devil, for God was with him;</hi> Acts. x. 38. and after all the <hi>Miracles</hi> that he did in his <hi>Life,</hi> by this Power and Presence of God that was in him, being barbarously murdered, he <hi>rose</hi> from the <hi>dead</hi> by the same Power, and <hi>ascended</hi> triumphantly to <hi>Heaven.</hi> Of the Truth of all which we have as <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>credible</hi> Testimony, as
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:34683:205"/>
ever was given to any Matters of Fact; the Report of them being handed down to us from those who were <hi>Eye</hi> and <hi>Ear-Witnesses;</hi> who in the defence of what they testified exposed themselves to infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Hazards,</hi> and at last confirmed their Testimony with their <hi>dearest Blood;</hi> which is the greatest <hi>Security,</hi> that any Witness can possibly give of his Honesty. For what should move them to <hi>testifie</hi> these things, had they not known them to be <hi>true?</hi> It was apparently their <hi>temporal</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest to have concealed them; and their <hi>Religion,</hi> in which their <hi>eternal</hi> Interest was involved, prohibited them all wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Lying</hi> under the Penalty of an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less <hi>Damnation:</hi> and would any Men in their wits have maintained a known <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture,</hi> when they were assured before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that all they should gain by it was to <hi>die</hi> for it <hi>here,</hi> and to be <hi>damned</hi> for it <hi>hereafter?</hi> And if their Testimony be <hi>true,</hi> as we have all manner of Reason to <hi>believe</hi> it is, then what they testifie doth plainly denote the Blessed <hi>Iesus</hi> to be the <hi>Holy One of God;</hi> from whom, as from his most holy Habitation, God would hereafter communicate all his Blessings to Mankind. And if so, then we are sure of eternal Life, upon condition of our <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient</hi>
                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:34683:206"/>
                  <hi>continuance in well-doing:</hi> for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he hath promised us, he must have promised us from God; who dwelt in the sacred Temple of his Body, and from thence pronounced the <hi>Oracles</hi> of his Grace and Goodness, and manifested himself perpetually by sundry <hi>miraculous Effects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM the Consideration of our <hi>Future Happiness,</hi> many useful Inferences may be raised: and First, from hence we may perceive, what an <hi>unreasonable</hi> thing it is for us <hi>Christians,</hi> immoderatly to doat upon the <hi>World.</hi> I confess,, if our <hi>chief,</hi> or <hi>only</hi> Interest were involved in <hi>this</hi> World, and we had no <hi>Hopes</hi> beyond the <hi>Grave;</hi> there were then some <hi>Excuse</hi> to be made for <hi>immoderate</hi> Sollicitude about the trifling Concerns of this <hi>present Life:</hi> but when it is so apparent, that we are born to <hi>higher</hi> Hopes, and are here but <hi>Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,</hi> and <hi>Probationers</hi> for an everlasting Preferment in the highest <hi>Heavens;</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks the Sense of it should make us blush at our own <hi>Follies,</hi> to think how <hi>busie</hi> we are in pursuing the fading <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of <hi>this</hi> World, whilst the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of our <hi>Eternity</hi> is wholly <hi>neglected</hi> and <hi>forgotten.</hi> Blessed God! Who would imagin, that in a World peopled with
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:34683:206"/>
                  <hi>immortal Spirits</hi> that must live for ever in unconceivable <hi>Happiness</hi> or <hi>Misery,</hi> the greatest Number of us should be such utter <hi>Strangers</hi> to the Thoughts, and Concerns of <hi>another</hi> World? That we who are so <hi>industrious</hi> in our <hi>temporal</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, as not to slip any Opportunity of <hi>Gain;</hi> but are so ready to court every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, that tends to advance these our <hi>momentary</hi> Pleasures, Profits and Honours; should be regardless of those <hi>Celestial</hi> Joys, which if we fall short of, we are <hi>undone</hi> for ever; and which if we arrive to, we shall be as <hi>happy</hi> as all the Beatitudes of an immortal <hi>Heaven</hi> can make us! O inconsiderate Beings that we are! Where is the <hi>Reason</hi> that constitutes us <hi>Men,</hi> that we should chuse thus <hi>crosly</hi> to the Nature of Things, when there is so vast a <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportion</hi> between the Objects of our Choice, between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Moments</hi> and <hi>Eternity,</hi> between the <hi>hungry</hi> and <hi>withering</hi> Joys of <hi>this</hi> World, and the <hi>eternally ravishing</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of the World to <hi>come?</hi> Methinks if we had any Dram of <hi>Reason</hi> left in us, the Consideration that we are born to an <hi>immortal</hi> Crown, which nothing but our own <hi>Folly</hi> can disseise us of, were enough to inspire us with a noble
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:34683:207"/>
                  <hi>Disdain</hi> of all these bewitching <hi>Vanities</hi> about us; and to make us look upon them as Things <hi>beneath</hi> us, Toys and Trifles, not worthy our scrambling for, When we consider, that there is an <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> of <hi>endless Ioys</hi> prepared for us, which if we will we may make as sure of, as we can of our own <hi>Beings;</hi> methinks so <hi>vast</hi> an <hi>Hope</hi> should raise our groveling Thoughts so high above this World, that when we look down upon it, it should disappear, or look like a thin blew Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skip next to <hi>nothing;</hi> and all the <hi>Hurries</hi> and <hi>Scramblings</hi> of silly Mortals for little Parcels of Earth, should seem as <hi>trifling</hi> and <hi>inconsiderable</hi> to us, as the Toils and Labours of a little World of Ants about a Molehil. For how is it possible almost, that such little <hi>Impertinencies</hi> should take up our Thoughts, who have an <hi>Eternity</hi> of <hi>Weal,</hi> and <hi>Woe</hi> before us? And when we have all that an <hi>everlasting Heaven</hi> means, to busie our Thoughts, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our Cares about, how can we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with so much Zeal and Vigour in the <hi>petty Affairs</hi> of this World? Foolish and unwise that we are! Thus to neglect our most <hi>important</hi> Interests for every <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent</hi> Trifle, to sell our <hi>Souls</hi> for a little money, and give immortal <hi>Hallelujahs</hi>
                  <pb n="387" facs="tcp:34683:207"/>
for a Song! And when we are born to such <hi>infinite</hi> Hopes, to chuse <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar's</hi> Fate, and leave <hi>Crowns</hi> and <hi>Scepters</hi> to live among the Savage <hi>Herds</hi> of the Wilderness.</p>
               <p>II FROM hence we may learn, how <hi>vigorous</hi> and <hi>industrious</hi> we ought to be in discharging the Duties of our Religion. For how can we think any <hi>Pains</hi> too much, when an everlasting <hi>Heaven</hi> is the Reward of our Labour? What a poor thing is it, that we should grudge to spend a few <hi>Moments</hi> here in the <hi>severest</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Vertue;</hi> when within this little little while, in considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our short <hi>Pains,</hi> we shall have nothing else to do throughout a long and blessed <hi>Eternity,</hi> but to enjoy a Heaven of <hi>pure Pleasures,</hi> and hath our Faculties for ever in fresh Delights; to converse with the Fountain of all <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and warble eternally Praises to him; and in the Vision of his <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> to live in <hi>everlasting</hi> Raptures of <hi>Ioy</hi> and <hi>Love?</hi> O my Soul! What though thou <hi>toilest</hi> and <hi>labourest</hi> now to climb the everlasting Hills! Yet be of good Heart, for it will not be long before thou art at the top, where thou wilt find such <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant</hi> Gales, and <hi>glorious</hi> Prospects as will make thee <hi>infinite</hi> Amends for all: yea,
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:34683:208"/>
though the <hi>Toil</hi> thou undergoest were abundantly <hi>more</hi> than it is; though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of the Labour of <hi>mortifying</hi> thy Lusts, and living <hi>soberly, righteously</hi> and <hi>godly,</hi> thy Task were to row in the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> or dig in the <hi>Mines</hi> for a thousand years together; yet methinks the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration that <hi>Heaven</hi> will be at last thy <hi>Reward,</hi> should be enough to <hi>sweeten,</hi> and <hi>endear</hi> it. O would we but often repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to our Minds the <hi>glorious</hi> Things of <hi>another</hi> World, what <hi>holy Fervours</hi> would such charming Thoughts kindle within us? And with how much <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Vigour</hi> would they carry us through the weary Stages of our Duty? what <hi>Lust</hi> is there so dear to us, that we should not <hi>willingly</hi> sacrifice to the Hopes of <hi>Immortality?</hi> What <hi>Duty</hi> so difficult, that we should not <hi>chearfully</hi> undergo, while the Crown of <hi>Glory</hi> is in our Eye? Surely did we but look more frequently to the <hi>recompence of Reward,</hi> we should be all Life and Spirit and Wing; our <hi>sluggish</hi> Souls would be inspired with an Angelical <hi>Vigour,</hi> and <hi>Activity;</hi> and we should run with <hi>Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity,</hi> as well as <hi>Patience, the race that is set before us:</hi> but alas! We look upon our <hi>Reward</hi> as a Thing a great way <hi>off;</hi> and 'tis, I confess, reserved for us within that invisible World whereinto our dull
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:34683:208"/>
                  <hi>Sense</hi> is not able to penetrate; which is the Reason that we are not so <hi>vigorously</hi> affected with it. Wherefore to make A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for this Disadvantage, let us often revive the Considerations of <hi>Eternity</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Minds, and inculcate the <hi>Reality</hi> and <hi>Certainty</hi> of our future Weal or Woe, together with the great <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance</hi> of them: let us thus reason with our selves; <hi>O my Soul! If it be so certain as it is, that there are such unspeakable Ioys reserved for good Men, and such intolerable Miseries for the wicked; why should not these things be to me, as if they were already present? Why should I not be as much afraid to sin, as if the gates of Hell stood open before me, and I saw the astonishing miseries of those damned Ghosts that are weltring in the flames of it? and why should I not as chearfully comply with my Duty, as if I had now a full prospect of the Regions of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and I saw the great Iesus at the right Hand of God, with Diadems of Glory in his Hand, to crown those pure and blessed Spirits who have been his faithful Servants to the death?</hi> And doubtless would we but <hi>inure</hi> our Minds a little to such Thoughts as these, they would wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>actuate</hi> all the Powers of our Souls, and be continually inspiring us with new
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:34683:209"/>
                  <hi>Vigour</hi> in the ways of <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:</hi> for what Difficulties are there that can daunt our good Resolutions, while they are animated with this Persuasion, that if we <hi>have our fruit unto holiness, our end shall be everlasting life?</hi> Rom. vi. xxii.</p>
               <p>III. FROM hence we may perceive, how <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> we ought to be in all our Professions and Actions. For if there be such an <hi>Happiness</hi> reserved for us in Heaven, then doubtless, if we intend to partake of it, we must be <hi>sincerely good;</hi> because he that is the Donour of this glorious Reward, is a God that <hi>searcheth the heart</hi> and <hi>tryeth the reins,</hi> and is a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Observer of our <hi>secret<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Thoughts and most <hi>retired</hi> Actions; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently will <hi>reward</hi> us, not according to what we <hi>seem</hi> to be, but to what we <hi>really are.</hi> We may possibly cheat <hi>Men</hi> into a fair Opinion of us, by disguising our selves in a <hi>form of Godliness,</hi> and facing our Conversation with <hi>specious Pretences</hi> of Piety: but <hi>that</hi> God, with whom we have to do, sees through all the <hi>Dawbings,</hi> and <hi>Fucus's</hi> of Hypocrisie; and can easily discern a rotten <hi>Core,</hi> through the most beautiful <hi>Rind,</hi> that can be distended over it. So that we can never hope to
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:34683:209"/>
obtain <hi>His</hi> Blessing, as <hi>Iacob</hi> did his blind Father's, by a counterfeit Voice, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour Disguise of Religion: for all the fair Vizards of <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> are so far from <hi>hiding</hi> our Blemishes from <hi>God,</hi> that they lay them more <hi>open</hi> to his all-seeing Eye, and make them appear more <hi>monstrous</hi> and <hi>deformed.</hi> Wherefore, unless we are <hi>really good,</hi> we were better not to <hi>seem</hi> to be so; for mere <hi>Pretences</hi> of Piety will be so far from procuring <hi>Salvation</hi> for us, that they will but enhanse and aggravate our <hi>Condemnation,</hi> and sink and plunge us deeper into <hi>Hell,</hi> instead of obtaining any Entrance for us into the Kingdom of <hi>Heaven.</hi> Since therefore there is such an <hi>immortal Reward</hi> prepared for us in the World to come, if we love <hi>our selves,</hi> or have any regard for our most <hi>important</hi> Interest, we cannot but be in <hi>good earnest</hi> for Heaven; and if we are so, we shall be <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>upright</hi> in all our Actions, and the great Design of our Lives will be to <hi>approve</hi> our selves to <hi>God,</hi> and our own <hi>Consciences.</hi> If by giving <hi>Alms</hi> we hope to increase our Stock in that great <hi>Bank</hi> of Bliss above, we shall not care so much to <hi>blow a Trumpet</hi> when we do it, that so the World may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and praise our Bounty; but our
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:34683:210"/>
rejoycing will be this, that we have <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved</hi> our selves to <hi>God,</hi> from whom we expect the Reward of our <hi>Obedience.</hi> If we <hi>abstain</hi> from Sin with respect to the <hi>future</hi> Recompence, we shall do it in <hi>private,</hi> as well as in the View of the <hi>World;</hi> knowing that wherever we are, we are under <hi>God's Eye,</hi> who alone can make us happy, or miserable for ever. In a word, if we <hi>seriously</hi> mind the Glory that is set before us, we shall be as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and secret <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses,</hi> as if they were to be exposed upon an open Theatre; considering that they are all <hi>open</hi> and <hi>naked</hi> to that <hi>God with whom we have to do,</hi> and upon whom the Hope of our immortal Happiness depends. For to what purpose should we dissemble and play the <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> unless we could impose upon the <hi>Almighty,</hi> and make <hi>Him</hi> believe that we are good, when we are not, and so <hi>steal</hi> to Heaven in a Vizard?</p>
               <p>Fourthly and Lastly, FROM hence 'tis visible, what great reason we have to be <hi>chearful</hi> under the <hi>Afflictions</hi> and <hi>Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> of this World; considering what <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Felicities</hi> there are prepared for us in the World to come. Indeed all the <hi>Miseries</hi> of this World are <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less,</hi> as
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:34683:210"/>
we have more or less reason to be <hi>supported</hi> under them; but when we consider, that our Time here is but a <hi>Moment,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with our <hi>everlasting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Abode in the World to come, our <hi>present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Happiness and Misery will appear to be very <hi>inconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> We are now upon our <hi>Iourney</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our heavenly Countrey, and it is no great matter how <hi>rough</hi> the Way is, provided that <hi>Heaven</hi> be our Journey's End: for though here we <hi>want</hi> many of those Accommodations which we may <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,</hi> and <hi>desire:</hi> yet this is but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Fate of <hi>Travellers,</hi> and we must be <hi>contented</hi> to take things as we find them, and not look to have every thing just to our Mind. But all these <hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> will shortly be <hi>over,</hi> and after a few days will be quite <hi>forgotten,</hi> and be to us as if they <hi>never</hi> had been: and when we are safely landed in our <hi>own Countrey,</hi> we shall look back from the Shore with <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Delight</hi> upon those boisterous Seas which we have escaped, and for ever <hi>bless</hi> the Storms and Winds that drove us thither. Wherefore hold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O my <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> a little longer, and your work will soon be at an end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all my <hi>Sighs</hi> and <hi>Groans</hi> within a few moments will expire into everlasting <hi>Songs</hi>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:34683:211"/>
and <hi>Hallelujahs:</hi>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now our days are dark and gloomy, but the bright glorious day is dawning, which Night shall never interrupt; for God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is the eternal Sun, that enlightens us with the bright Rays of his own Glory. And what is a little cloudy Weather compared with an everlasting Sun-shine? Doubtless these <hi>light Afflictions which are but for a moment, are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us.</hi> Let us therefore comfort our selves with these things, and while we are groaning under the <hi>Miseries</hi> of this Life, let us <hi>encourage</hi> our selves with this Consideration; that within a little little while all our <hi>Tears</hi> shall be wiped from our <hi>Eyes,</hi> and there shall be an <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Period put to all our <hi>Sorrows</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series;</hi> when we shall be removed from all the Troubles and Temptations of a <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>ill-natur'd</hi> World, be past all <hi>Storms,</hi> and secured from all further danger of <hi>Shipwrack,</hi> and be safely landed in the Regions of <hi>Bliss</hi> and <hi>Immortality.</hi> And can we complain of the <hi>Foulness</hi> of a way, that leads into a <hi>Paradise</hi> of endless De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights;
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:34683:211"/>
and not chearfully undergo these <hi>short</hi> though <hi>bitter</hi> Throws, which, like the <hi>Virgin-Mother</hi>'s, will quickly end in Songs and everlasting <hi>Magnificats?</hi> Chear up therefore, O my crest-fallen Soul, for thy <hi>bitter Passion</hi> will soon be at an end; and though now thou art sailing in a <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestuous Sea,</hi> yet a few Leagues off lyes that <hi>blessed Port,</hi> where thou shalt be <hi>crowned</hi> as soon as thou art <hi>landed;</hi> and then the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of the <hi>Storms</hi> thou hast passed will contribute to the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs</hi> of thy <hi>Coronation;</hi> and all the <hi>bad Entertainments</hi> thou meetest with in this life, will but make Earth more <hi>loathsome</hi> to thee while thou art here, and Heaven more <hi>welcome</hi> when thou comest there; and these thy <hi>light Afflictions which are but for a moment will work for thee a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi> 2 Cor. iv. 17.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I COME now to the <hi>Second</hi> thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, namely that the <hi>eternal</hi> Life and Happiness of good Men depends upon their <hi>mortifying</hi> the Deeds of the Body: and that it doth so, I shall endeavour to prove,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, FROM God's <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, FROM the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Thing.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I. FROM God's <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> God, who is the supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the World, hath proposed <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> as an Encouragement to those who by <hi>patient continuance in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality:</hi> And sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that <hi>wicked</hi> Men could enjoy the Happiness of the other World, yet it would be inconsistent with the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of his Government to admit them to it. For should he reward <hi>Offenders</hi> with eternal Happiness, who would be afraid of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending him? And if once he rules with
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:34683:212"/>
such a <hi>slack</hi> and <hi>indulgent</hi> Rein, as to take away all reason of <hi>Fear</hi> from his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, his <hi>Government</hi> must immediately dissolve into <hi>Anarchy</hi> and <hi>Confusion.</hi> And therefore to prevent this, he hath fairly <hi>warned</hi> us by his reiterated <hi>Threats,</hi> that if we live in <hi>Disobedience</hi> to his Laws, we shall be for ever <hi>banished</hi> from that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Happiness</hi> which he hath prepared for those that <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> him: So in <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 13. we are assured, that if <hi>we live after the flesh, we shall die:</hi> And in <hi>Gal.</hi> v. 19, 20, 21. we are told, that <hi>the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these, adultery, fornication, uncleanness, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellings, and such like; of which I tell you before, as I have also told you in times past, that they which do such things shall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the kingdom of God:</hi> And so 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. 9, 10. <hi>Know ye not</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? be not deceived, neither fornicators nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God:</hi> And to the same purpose the
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:34683:213"/>
same Apostle tells us, that <hi>no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man who is an idolater hath any inheritance in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God;</hi> Ephes. v. 5. All which dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Denunciations</hi> must be supposed to be <hi>conditional;</hi> for else they are not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the Promise of <hi>Pardon</hi> to those that truly <hi>repent:</hi> So that the meaning of them is plainly this, that if we <hi>persevere</hi> in these Lusts of the Flesh, and do <hi>not mortify</hi> them, we shall have no Part nor Portion in the Kingdom of God. Hence the Apostle exhorts us, <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 5, 6. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify therefore your members which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection, evil concupiscence, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, which is idolatry: for which things sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:</hi> which plainly implies, that if they <hi>did mortify</hi> these Lusts, the Wrath of God should not come upon them; but if they <hi>did not,</hi> they should be liable to the divine Indignation among the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Disobedience.</hi> By all which it is apparent, that according to God's free <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination</hi> and Appointment, our eternal <hi>Happiness</hi> and <hi>Welfare</hi> depends upon our <hi>mortifying</hi> the deeds of the Body; since God hath so ordained, that if we <hi>do</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them, we shall <hi>live,</hi> and that if we
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:34683:213"/>
                  <hi>do not,</hi> we shall be for ever <hi>excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated</hi> from the Regions of Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>
               <p>II. THIS is also apparent from the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the Thing. For if God had not excluded those that live in their sins from eternal Life, by his own free <hi>Ordination;</hi> yet they must have been excluded, the <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> Happiness being so <hi>inconsistent</hi> with a <hi>vicious</hi> State, that it is impossible ever to <hi>reconcile</hi> them. For the Thing it self im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> and is not an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of any <hi>Power,</hi> no not of <hi>Omnipotence</hi> it self; and God may as well make <hi>White</hi> to be <hi>Black</hi> while it is <hi>White,</hi> as a <hi>vicious</hi> Soul to be <hi>happy</hi> while it is <hi>vicious.</hi> For Happiness is a <hi>relative</hi> thing, and doth in its own <hi>Nature</hi> imply a Correspondence and Agreement between the <hi>Faculty</hi> and the <hi>Object;</hi> and be the <hi>Object</hi> never so good in it self, yet if it doth not <hi>agree</hi> with the <hi>Faculty</hi> whereunto it is objected, it is <hi>Misery</hi> and <hi>Affliction</hi> to it. Though a Man should be entertained with all the delicate Relishes of <hi>Musick,</hi> yet if he hath not a <hi>musical Ear,</hi> it will be but a <hi>tedious ungrateful</hi> Din to him: And though his <hi>Appetite</hi> should be courted with all the <hi>rich varieties</hi> in Nature, yet if they do not <hi>agree</hi> with his coarse and homely Palate,
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:34683:214"/>
he will <hi>distaste</hi> and <hi>nauseate</hi> them. And so if a Man should be placed in <hi>Heaven,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Joys with which that <hi>blessed State</hi> abounds; yet unless his <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> did <hi>suit</hi> and <hi>agree</hi> with them, they would all be so many <hi>Miseries</hi> and <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to him; he would be afflicted even in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom, and grope for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the midst of Paradise; and it would be impossible for him to be <hi>pleased</hi> with his Condition, till the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> of his Mind were <hi>alter'd,</hi> and the <hi>Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of his Soul were <hi>reconciled</hi> to that heavenly State. So that if we can demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, that there is and must be <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Disagreement</hi> in <hi>wicked</hi> Souls to the <hi>future Happiness;</hi> it will then be apparent from the <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of the Thing, that our Enjoyment of the future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness depends upon our ceasing to be <hi>wicked;</hi> or which is all one, upon our <hi>mortifying</hi> the Deeds of the Flesh. Now to evidence this Disagreement between <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Souls, and the <hi>heavenly</hi> State, I shall do these three things;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>First, SHEW <hi>wherein</hi> the Felicities of the <hi>future State</hi> do consist.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, WHAT the Temper and Disposition of wicked Souls will be in the <hi>future State.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="401" facs="tcp:34683:214"/>Thirdly, HOW <hi>contrary</hi> such a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Disposition must be unto such <hi>Felicities.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>I. I am to shew <hi>wherein</hi> the Felicities of the <hi>future State</hi> do consist. And here I shall not presume to give you a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Description of <hi>Heaven,</hi> the Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whereof the Apostle tells us are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable;</hi> but shall content my self to give you the <hi>general</hi> Account of it, which I find in the Revelation of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> In general therefore we may be secure of this, that <hi>Heaven</hi> is such an Happiness as is most suitable to a <hi>Rational</hi> Nature; it being designed and prepared for <hi>reasonable</hi> Beings, to whom (as I have shewed) it would not be a Heaven, if it were not <hi>agreeable</hi> to their Natures. For should God have provided for us a Heaven of <hi>sensual Felicities,</hi> to gratify the unbounded Licorishness of our <hi>carnal</hi> Appetites; it would have been a Happiness fitter for <hi>Beasts</hi> than <hi>Men:</hi> And whilst our <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>bruitish</hi> Part had been feasted with everlasting Varieties of <hi>carnal</hi> Pleasures, our <hi>intellectual</hi> Powers, which are the <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest</hi> Ingredients of our Natures, must have pined away a long Eternity, for want of those Joys and Delights, which alone are <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>agreeable</hi> to their Natures. Now
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:34683:215"/>
our <hi>proper</hi> Happiness, as we are <hi>reasonable</hi> Beings, consists in being perfectly <hi>Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> and in the <hi>Union</hi> of our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Wills, and Affections, with such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as are most agreeable to our <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Natures: And what is it to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>rational,</hi> but to reason truly accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Nature</hi> of Things; and to choose and refuse, and love and hate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Dictates of <hi>true Reason?</hi> And what is it to have our Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Wills and Affections <hi>united</hi> to such Objects as are most <hi>agreeable</hi> to our <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> Natures, but only to <hi>know</hi> that which is most <hi>worthy</hi> to be known, and to <hi>choose</hi> and <hi>love</hi> that which is most <hi>worthy</hi> to be chosen and loved? When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our <hi>Understanding</hi> is become so <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>vigorous,</hi> as to <hi>reason</hi> aright, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate into the <hi>Natures</hi> of things; and our <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> are perfectly <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant</hi> and <hi>harmonious</hi> with it; and all these are in conjunction with <hi>God,</hi> the Fountain of all <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Goodness;</hi> we are then arrived to the <hi>heavenly</hi> State of <hi>reasonable</hi> Natures. And therefore all that is positively affirmed of the <hi>heavenly Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi> in the Gospel, is only this; that it consists in our <hi>seeing God,</hi> and loving and resembling him, and being for ever asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:34683:215"/>
with those <hi>blessed Spirits,</hi> that see and love and resemble him as well as <hi>We.</hi> And this doubtless is such a <hi>Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> as no mortal Language can express: For how will my <hi>Understanding</hi> triumph, when it is once emerged out of all the <hi>Mists</hi> and <hi>Clouds,</hi> with which it is here surrounded, into the clear Heaven of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> where it shall have a free and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted Prospect throughout the whole <hi>Horizon</hi> of <hi>Truth;</hi> when God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and all the Mysteries of the other World shall be always <hi>present</hi> to my ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished Thoughts? How <hi>hail</hi> and <hi>sound,</hi> how <hi>light</hi> and <hi>expedite</hi> will my Soul be, when it is disentangled from all those <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable Passions,</hi> which here do clog and disease her? When all her jarring Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties shall be reduced into a <hi>perfect Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> what a Heaven of <hi>Content</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> will there spring up within her own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som? And when she is thus contempered to the <hi>Divine</hi> Perfection, and inspired throughout with a <hi>God-like</hi> Nature, in what Raptures of <hi>Love</hi> and Extasies of <hi>Ioys</hi> will she converse with <hi>God</hi> and <hi>blessed Spirits?</hi> This doubtless, if there were no more, is enough to make the <hi>heavenly</hi> State unspeakably <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>blessed:</hi> And this together with a perfect Freedom from
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:34683:216"/>
                  <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Misery,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> is all of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that God hath made known to us in his Gospel: Here we are told that we shall be made <hi>perfect,</hi> that we shall <hi>see</hi> as we are <hi>seen,</hi> and <hi>know</hi> as we are <hi>known,</hi> and <hi>behold</hi> him that is <hi>Invisible</hi> face to face: For <hi>yet it doth not appear what we shall be,</hi> saith St. <hi>Iohn, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.</hi> 1 Epist. iii. 2. There may be, and doubtless are sundry <hi>additional</hi> Felicities to these; but in these it is apparent the <hi>main</hi> of Heaven doth consist, because these are all that God hath plainly <hi>revealed,</hi> and made <hi>known</hi> to us.</p>
               <p>II. THE next thing proposed was to shew, what the Temper and Disposition of <hi>wicked Souls</hi> will be in the <hi>future State.</hi> And this may be easily gathered, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering wherein a <hi>wicked</hi> Temper <hi>consists;</hi> for doubtless with the <hi>same</hi> Temper of Mind that we are of in <hi>this</hi> World, we shall go into the <hi>other:</hi> for meerly by <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> into the <hi>other</hi> World, Men cannot be altered as to their <hi>main State,</hi> though they may be perfected as to those good Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spositions that were here <hi>begun;</hi> so that he that is wicked <hi>here</hi> will be wicked <hi>there</hi> too, and that <hi>same</hi> Disposition of
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:34683:216"/>
Mind that we carry with us to our <hi>Graves,</hi> we shall retain with us in <hi>Eternity.</hi> If therefore we would know, what the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of a <hi>wicked</hi> Soul will be in the <hi>future State;</hi> our best way will be to enquire, what it is that we call a <hi>wicked</hi> Temper here; because it will be the <hi>same</hi> here, and hereafter. Now a <hi>wicked</hi> Temper consists of two things; First, of <hi>Sensuality,</hi> and Secondly, of <hi>Devilishness.</hi> By <hi>Sensuality,</hi> I mean an <hi>immoderate</hi> Propension of the <hi>Soul</hi> to the Pleasures of the <hi>Body;</hi> such an <hi>head-strong</hi> Propension, as wholly <hi>diverts</hi> the Soul from all her <hi>nobler Delights</hi> to the <hi>brutish Pleasures</hi> of Intemperance, and Wantonness and Gluttony; together with those other <hi>Lusts</hi> that are subservient to them, such as Fraud, and Covetousness, and Ambition, and the like: By <hi>Devilish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> I mean those <hi>spiritual Wickednesses</hi> which do not so much depend upon the <hi>Body</hi> as the former, but are more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately centered in the <hi>Soul,</hi> such as Pride, and Malice, and Wrath, and Envy, and Hatred, and Revenge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are the Sins of the <hi>Devil,</hi> by which those once <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi> Spirits were transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Furies.</hi> These are the Venomous <hi>Ingredients</hi> of which a <hi>wicked</hi> Temper is composed. If you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:34683:217"/>
therefore what the Temper of a <hi>wicked</hi> Soul will be in the <hi>future State;</hi> I answer, it will be the same <hi>there</hi> that it is here; that is, it will be <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>devilish.</hi> As for the <hi>latter,</hi> there can be no doubt of it; for <hi>Devilishness</hi> being immediately subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Soul,</hi> cannot be supposed to be <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated</hi> from her by her Separation from the <hi>Body;</hi> and may as well abide in <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked</hi> and <hi>separated Spirits,</hi> as it doth in the Apostate <hi>Angels.</hi> And as for <hi>Sensuality,</hi> though it cannot be supposed that a <hi>Soul</hi> should retain the Appetites of the <hi>Body,</hi> after it is <hi>separated</hi> from it; yet having wholly abandon'd it self to <hi>corporeal</hi> Pleasures while it was in the <hi>Body,</hi> it may, and doubtless will retain a <hi>vehement Hankering</hi> after a Re-union with it, which is the only <hi>Sensuality</hi> that a <hi>separated</hi> Soul is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. For when She comes into the World of <hi>Spirits,</hi> her former <hi>accustoming</hi> her self unto the Pleasures of the <hi>Body</hi> will have so <hi>debauched</hi> and <hi>vitiated</hi> her Appetite; that She will be <hi>incapable</hi> of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing any other Pleasures, but what are <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>sensual;</hi> which because She can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy but in the <hi>Body,</hi> She must needs retain an <hi>earnest</hi> and <hi>vehement</hi> Longing to be re-united to it. For having never had any former Experience of the Pleasures
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:34683:217"/>
of <hi>Spirits,</hi> when she comes into the <hi>other</hi> World, she will find her self miserably <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute</hi> of all that can be <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful</hi> to her; and because she knows, that the only pleasures she can relish are such as are not to be enjoyed, but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the <hi>Body,</hi> therefore all her <hi>Appetites</hi> and <hi>Longings</hi> must needs unite into one outragious Desire of being <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body'd</hi> again, that so she may repeat these <hi>sensual</hi> Pleasures, and act over the <hi>brutish</hi> Scene anew. Which possibly may be the Reason, why such sensual Souls have <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared</hi> so often in <hi>Church-yards,</hi> and <hi>Charnel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses,</hi> Union with the Body being that which these wandring <hi>Ghosts</hi> have the most <hi>eager</hi> Affections to, and that they are most <hi>loth</hi> to be <hi>separated</hi> from; which makes them perpetually <hi>hover</hi> about, and <hi>linger</hi> after their dear Consort, the <hi>Body;</hi> the Impossibility of their <hi>Re-union</hi> with it not being able <hi>to cure</hi> them of their impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Desires,</hi> but still they would fain be alive again. <hi>Virgil.</hi>

               <p>And this, I doubt not, was one great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of those extraordinary <hi>Abstinencies,</hi>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:34683:218"/>
and bodily <hi>Severities</hi> that were imposed by the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church; that by this means they might gently <hi>wean</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> from the Pleasures of the <hi>Body,</hi> and teach it <hi>before-hand</hi> to live upon the Delights of <hi>separated</hi> Spirits; that so it might drop into Eternity with <hi>Ease</hi> and <hi>Willingness,</hi> like ripe Fruit from the Tree; and that when it was arrived into the <hi>other</hi> World, it might not have its Appetite so <hi>vitiated</hi> with these <hi>sensual</hi> Delights, as to be <hi>inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> of relishing those <hi>spiritual</hi> Ones, and so be endlesly <hi>tormented</hi> with a fruitless Desire of <hi>returning</hi> to the Body again. This therefore from the whole is plain and apparent, that the Temper of <hi>wicked</hi> Souls in the <hi>other</hi> World will be much the same as it is in <hi>this;</hi> that is, <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>devilish,</hi> made up of Rage and Spight and Malice, together with a <hi>vehement.</hi> Longing after the deserted <hi>Body,</hi> in which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the only Pleasures they were <hi>capable</hi> of.</p>
               <p>AND having thus shewed you, what are the <hi>Felicities</hi> of the <hi>future State;</hi> and what the Temper of <hi>wicked</hi> Souls will be in the <hi>future State;</hi> I now proceed,</p>
               <p>III. To shew you, how <hi>contrary</hi> such a Temper and Disposition must be unto such <hi>Felicities.</hi> And indeed <hi>Sensuality</hi> and
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:34683:218"/>
                  <hi>Devilishness</hi> are the only <hi>Indispositions</hi> for Heaven; but <hi>such Indispositions</hi> they are, that if upon an <hi>impossible</hi> Supposition a Soul could be admitted with them into the Habitations of the <hi>Blessed,</hi> She would not be <hi>able</hi> to relish one Pleasure there, among all the Delights with which the <hi>beatifick</hi> State abounds: there would none be found that would please her <hi>distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd</hi> Palate, which, like a <hi>fevourish</hi> Tongue, must disrelish and nauseate the sweetest Liquor, by reason of its over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing Gall. And hence the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting his Christian <hi>Colossians,</hi> to be <hi>thankful</hi> unto God for making them <hi>meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light;</hi> telleth them, that this was effected by God's <hi>translating</hi> them out of the Kingdom of <hi>darkness into the Kingdom of his own dear Son;</hi> that is, by enabling them to mortifie their Lusts, and inspiring them with the Graces of the Gospel: 1 <hi>Colos.</hi> xii. 13. And this will evidently appear, if we consider the <hi>particular Felicities</hi> of which the heavenly State consists; which (as I have shewed above) consist, First, In the <hi>Vision</hi> of God; Secondly, In <hi>our Likeness</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance</hi> to Him; Thirdly, In the <hi>Love</hi> of Him; and fourthly, In the <hi>Society</hi> of
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:34683:219"/>
                  <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi> Spirits: to all which there is an utter <hi>Antipathy</hi> and <hi>Disagreement</hi> in every <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Temper and Disposition.</p>
               <p>I. IN every <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Mind, there is an <hi>Antipathy</hi> and <hi>Contrariety</hi> to the <hi>Vision</hi> of God; for the Sight of <hi>God</hi> can be pleasant unto none, but those who are in some measure <hi>contemper'd</hi> to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and <hi>transform'd</hi> into his Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. While we are <hi>unlike</hi> him, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to him, as we must needs be while we are <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>devilish,</hi> the Sight of Him would be more apt to <hi>amaze</hi> and <hi>terrifie,</hi> than to <hi>please</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> us; for what <hi>Pleasure</hi> could a Soul take in the <hi>Vision</hi> of that <hi>God,</hi> whom She always <hi>hated,</hi> and could never endure to <hi>think</hi> of? Doubtless She would be so far from being <hi>pleased</hi> with the Sight of him, that it would be her <hi>Grief</hi> and <hi>Torment</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him. The Sight of his <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> would be so far from <hi>delighting</hi> her, that it would but <hi>reproach</hi> her <hi>lewd</hi> and <hi>sordid</hi> Degeneracy from the Temper of a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>immortal</hi> Spirit: the Vision of his <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> would be so far from <hi>pleasing</hi> her, that it would but <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid</hi> the horrid <hi>devilishness</hi> of her own disposition: and which way soever She
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:34683:219"/>
turned her Eyes, She would see nothing in God, but what did <hi>libel</hi> and <hi>condemn</hi> her own <hi>Impurity</hi> and <hi>Wickedness.</hi> And how is it possible, that such a <hi>Sight</hi> should ever be <hi>pleasing</hi> unto such a <hi>Spectator?</hi> Doubtless the <hi>Vision</hi> of God, which is the Heaven of <hi>Godlike</hi> Souls, would be a Hell to <hi>wicked</hi> Ones; it would chase them out of Heaven, if they were in it, and cause them to fly away from before the <hi>Glory</hi> of it, as Bats and Owls do from the Light of the Sun, and of their <hi>own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> to wrap their guilty Heads in the Shades of <hi>eternal Darkness,</hi> and <hi>Despair.</hi> For how could they endure the Sight of that God, in whom, while they continue so <hi>infinitely unlike</hi> him, it is impossible they should see any thing but Causes of <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> and <hi>Confusion?</hi> For there must be in us some <hi>Likeness</hi> and <hi>Resemblance</hi> of God, to dispose us to behold him with <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Delight.</hi> For as <hi>Maximus Tyrius</hi> hath well observed, the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Divine Nature which is not visible to the eye of Sense,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Diss<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I. <hi>Is yet visible to that in the Soul; which is most pure and beautiful and sublime and noble, in respect of</hi>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:34683:220"/>
                  <hi>a certain similitude and cognation that is between them.</hi> But where this similitude is <hi>wanting,</hi> the Vision of God will be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>Hell,</hi> than a <hi>Heaven:</hi> if there be no <hi>Correspondence</hi> between what we see in <hi>God,</hi> and what we are in our <hi>selves,</hi> his Glory may <hi>confound</hi> and <hi>dazzle</hi> us; but it is impossible it should <hi>please</hi> us: for what <hi>Pleasure</hi> can we take in seeing that which is so infinitely <hi>disagreeable</hi> to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
               <p>II. IN every <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Mind there is an utter <hi>Indisposition</hi> and <hi>Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety</hi> to the <hi>Love</hi> of God; for all <hi>Love</hi> is founded in <hi>Likeness,</hi> and doth result out of some <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Resemblance</hi> that there is between the <hi>Lover</hi> and the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</hi> But what <hi>Resemblance</hi> can there be between a <hi>devilish</hi> and <hi>carnalized</hi> Soul, and a <hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> God? And if there be none, <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Darkness,</hi> or <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi> may as soon agree, as They. For how can a Soul, whose Affections are drenched in <hi>Matter,</hi> and wedded to the <hi>Flesh,</hi> love the holy <hi>God,</hi> who is a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>spotless Spirit?</hi> What Amity can there be in a <hi>black</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Nature towards the most <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>benign</hi> Being in the World? Doubtless from such a <hi>Contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of Natures there must necessarily
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:34683:220"/>
spring <hi>mutual</hi> Antipathies and <hi>Aversations.</hi> So that could such a Soul be admitted to the <hi>Vision</hi> of God, she would see nothing in him but what would <hi>enrage</hi> and <hi>canker</hi> her with Malice against him: the Sight of those <hi>glorious Perfections</hi> in him, which are so <hi>repugnant</hi> to her own Nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of <hi>enamouring</hi> her, would but boil up her Hatred into an higher degree of <hi>Aversation</hi> to him. For even here we see, it is natural to <hi>lewd</hi> and <hi>wicked</hi> Men, to picture God by the <hi>foul</hi> and <hi>monstrous</hi> Original of their own Tempers; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the Notion which they have of <hi>him</hi> is nothing but the Image of <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi> which <hi>Narcissus-like</hi> they fall in love with, because it represents what they most delight in, even their own darling and beloved <hi>Lusts.</hi> Which is a plain Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument that they cannot <hi>love</hi> God, till they have deformed him into their <hi>own likeness,</hi> and with the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> copyed him out in the Resemblance of their own <hi>black</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Tempers. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they shall see Him as <hi>He is,</hi> encircled about with his own Rays of <hi>unstained</hi> and <hi>immaculate</hi> Glory; the vast <hi>Unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> they will then discern between <hi>Him</hi> and <hi>themselves,</hi> will doubtless <hi>enrage</hi> and <hi>sowr</hi> their Spirits against him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:34683:221"/>
all their <hi>fondness</hi> towards him into an utter <hi>Antipathy</hi> and <hi>Aversation:</hi> for so long as <hi>He</hi> continues what <hi>He</hi> is, and <hi>they</hi> what <hi>they</hi> are, there will be such an <hi>irreconcileable: Contrariety</hi> between them, that they must <hi>hate</hi> either God or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or else <hi>love</hi> Contraries at the same time, which is impossible.</p>
               <p>III. IN every <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> mind there is a strong Indisposition to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made <hi>like</hi> unto God, <hi>i. e.</hi> there is the same Indisposition in them to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the <hi>Likeness</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> of God, as there is in <hi>one Contrary</hi> to admit of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Their <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will as naturally <hi>resist</hi> the transforming Impressions of the divine <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> as Fire doth <hi>Water,</hi> or Moisture <hi>Drought:</hi> for the Image of <hi>God</hi> being a <hi>moral Perfection,</hi> must be impressed on us by the intervening Ministry of our <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings,</hi> that is, by our Sight and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of him; and hence the Apostle gives this Reason why <hi>we shall be like him</hi> when he doth appear, because <hi>we shall see him as he is:</hi> 1 Joh. iii. 2. But the Sight of God, which <hi>assimilates</hi> us to him, must be accompanied with the <hi>Love</hi> of him, for it is <hi>Love</hi> that provokes to <hi>Imitation,</hi> and <hi>Imitation</hi> that <hi>transforms</hi> the Lover into
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:34683:221"/>
the Image of the Beloved. For though doubtless the <hi>beatifick Vision</hi> doth work far more effectually upon <hi>prepared</hi> Souls in the <hi>other</hi> Life, than the <hi>knowledg</hi> of God doth in <hi>this;</hi> because <hi>here</hi> we see but in <hi>a glass darkly,</hi> whereas <hi>there</hi> our Vision will be unspeakably more <hi>clear, intense</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous:</hi> yet I doubt not but in assimilating us to God, it works in a <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> way; that is, by <hi>vigorously affecting</hi> our Wills with the Perfections of God, so as to stir us up to an <hi>active Imitation</hi> of them, and <hi>efficaciously</hi> to excite us to <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe</hi> them into our own Natures; which it cannot be supposed to do, unless our Souls be in some measure <hi>predisposed</hi> by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness and Purity to the <hi>Love</hi> of God, and of those glorious Perfections we shall then behold in him. For if we do not <hi>love God,</hi> the Sight of him will be so far from provoking us to <hi>imitate</hi> him; that it will <hi>avert</hi> us from him, and render us more <hi>unimpressive</hi> to the transforming Power of his glory. 'Tis true, this <hi>Vision</hi> of God will <hi>perfect</hi> our <hi>Likeness</hi> to him, if it be <hi>begun;</hi> because then it will have a <hi>prepared Subject</hi> to act upon, a Soul that is <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd</hi> and <hi>dispos'd</hi> to the Power of it; and to take Impression from it: but yet it will not <hi>create</hi> a Likeness where it never
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:34683:222"/>
                  <hi>was,</hi> but will leave him that is <hi>wicked</hi> to be <hi>wicked still;</hi> he being an <hi>incapable Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of its benign Influences, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>indisposed</hi> to be wrought upon by it. For as the <hi>Sun</hi> enlightens not the inward parts of an impervious <hi>Dunghil,</hi> and hath no other effect upon it, but only to draw out its filthy <hi>Reeks</hi> and <hi>Steams;</hi> though as soon as he lifts his head above the Hemisphere, he immediately transforms into his own <hi>Likeness</hi> all that vast Space whether he can diffuse his Beams, and turns it into a Region of <hi>Light:</hi> even so the <hi>divine Glory</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> which is the Object of the beatifical Vision, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver illustrate <hi>lewd</hi> and <hi>filthy</hi> Souls; their Temper being <hi>impervious</hi> unto his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Irradiations, and wholly <hi>indisposed</hi> to be enlightned by it; but instead of that it will <hi>irritate</hi> their devilish Rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, and provoke them to <hi>bark</hi> at that Light which they cannot <hi>endure:</hi> whereas it no sooner arises upon <hi>well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed</hi> Minds, but it will immediately <hi>chase away</hi> all those Reliques of <hi>Darkness</hi> remaining in them, and <hi>transform</hi> them into its own <hi>Likeness.</hi> But doubtless the Sight of the <hi>divine Purity,</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> will be so far from exciting <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Spirits to <hi>transcribe</hi> and <hi>imitate</hi>
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:34683:222"/>
it; that it will rather inspire them with <hi>Indignation</hi> against it, and provoke them to <hi>curse</hi> and <hi>blaspheme</hi> the Author of it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and Lastly, IN every <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Soul there is an utter <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity,</hi> and <hi>Disagreement</hi> to the <hi>Society</hi> of the Spirits of <hi>just Men made perfect.</hi> For even in <hi>this</hi> Life we see, how <hi>ungrateful</hi> the Society of <hi>good</hi> Men is unto those that are <hi>wicked:</hi> it <hi>spoils</hi> them of their fulsome Mirth, and <hi>checks</hi> them in those Riots and Scurrilities which are the <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Piquancy</hi> of their Conversation. So that when the <hi>good</hi> Man takes his leave, they reckon themselves <hi>deliver'd,</hi> his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> being a <hi>Confinement</hi> to their Folly and Wickedness. And as it is in <hi>this,</hi> so doubtless it will be in the <hi>other</hi> World: for how is it possible there should be any <hi>Agreement</hi> between such <hi>distant</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> Tempers, between such <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>malicious,</hi> and such <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>benigne</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits? What a <hi>Torment</hi> would it be to a <hi>spightful,</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Spirit to be confined to a <hi>Society</hi> that is governed by the Laws of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Friendship?</hi> What an <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity</hi> to a <hi>carnalized</hi> Soul, that nauseates all Pleasures but what are <hi>fleshly</hi> and <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual,</hi> to be shut up among those <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>abstracted</hi> Spirits, that live wholly upon
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:34683:223"/>
the Pleasures of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> and <hi>Love?</hi> Doubtless it would be as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to a <hi>Wolf,</hi> to be governed by the <hi>Ten Commandments,</hi> and fed with Lectures of <hi>Philosophy;</hi> as for such a Soul to live under the Laws, and be entertained with the Delights of the <hi>heavenly Society.</hi> So that could these <hi>wicked</hi> Spirits be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the Company of the <hi>Blessed,</hi> they would soon be <hi>weary</hi> of it; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it would be so <hi>tedious</hi> and <hi>irksom</hi> to them, that they would rather <hi>chuse</hi> to associate themselves with <hi>Devils,</hi> and <hi>damned</hi> Ghosts, than to undergoe the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of a Conversation so infinitely <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant</hi> to their Natures; accounting it more <hi>eligible</hi> to live in the dismal Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of hellish <hi>Threnes</hi> and <hi>Blasphemies,</hi> than to have a tedious Din of <hi>heavenly Praises</hi> and <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> perpetually ringing in their Ears. And indeed considering the <hi>hellish</hi> Nature of a wicked Soul, how <hi>contrary</hi> it is to the Goodness and Purity of <hi>Heaven;</hi> I have sometimes been apt to think, that it will be <hi>less miserable</hi> in those dismal Shades, where the wretched Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, like so many Snakes and Adders do nothing but hiss at and sting one another for ever; than it would be, were it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the <hi>glorious Society</hi> of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:34683:223"/>
Lovers, whose whole Conversation consists in <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>reloving,</hi> and is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a perpetual Intercourse of <hi>mutual Indearments.</hi> For this would be an Employment, so infinitely <hi>repugnant</hi> to its <hi>black</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Disposition; that rather than endure so much <hi>Outrage</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> it would of its <hi>own accord</hi> forsake the <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> Abodes, to flee to <hi>Hell</hi> for Sanctuary from the Torment of being in <hi>Heaven.</hi> But this however we may rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that so long as the <hi>prevailing</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of our Souls is <hi>sensual</hi> and <hi>devilish,</hi> we are <hi>incapable</hi> of the Society of blessed Spirits; and that if it were possible for us to be admitted into it, our <hi>Condition</hi> would be very <hi>unhappy,</hi> till our <hi>Temper</hi> was chang'd: so that it is a plain Case both from <hi>God's Ordination,</hi> and from the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Thing,</hi> that our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happiness and Welfare depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our <hi>mortifying</hi> the deeds of the Body.</p>
               <p>To offer some <hi>Practical Inferences</hi> from hence;</p>
               <p>I. WE may perceive how <hi>unreasonable</hi> it is, for any Man to presume upon going to Heaven, upon any account whatsoever without <hi>mortifying</hi> his Lusts. For he that thinks to go to Heaven without <hi>Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> and <hi>Amendment,</hi> presumes both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:34683:224"/>
the <hi>Decrees</hi> of God and the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of Things: he believes all the <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> of the Gospel to be nothing else but so many <hi>Bugs,</hi> and <hi>Scare-crows;</hi> and though God hath told him again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that unless he forsake his <hi>sins,</hi> he shall never enter into the Kingdom of <hi>Heaven;</hi> yet he fondly imagines, that when it comes to the Trial, God will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be so <hi>severe</hi> as he pretends; but will rather <hi>revoke</hi> the Decree that is gone out of his mouth, than <hi>exclude</hi> out of the Paradise of endless Delights a Soul that is infinitely <hi>offensive</hi> to him. As if God were so <hi>invincibly</hi> fond and indulgent, as that rather than excommunicate an <hi>obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Rebel</hi> from Happiness, he would chuse to <hi>prostitute</hi> the Honour of his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> and commit an Outrage upon the <hi>Rectitude</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of his own Nature. For so long as he is a <hi>pure God,</hi> he cannot but be displeased with <hi>impure Souls;</hi> and so long as he is a <hi>wise Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,</hi> he cannot but be <hi>offended</hi> with those that trample upon his <hi>Laws:</hi> so that before he can admit a <hi>wicked Soul</hi> into Heaven, he must have extinguish'd all his natural Antipathy to <hi>Sin,</hi> and stifled his just Resentment of our wilful <hi>Affronts</hi> to his <hi>Authority.</hi> When therefore we can
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:34683:224"/>
find any reason to imagine, that God is no Enemy to <hi>sin,</hi> and that he hath no regard of his own <hi>Authority;</hi> then, and not till then, we may have some Pretence to presume upon going to Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Amendment.</hi> But supposing this Hinderance were removed, and that God were so <hi>easie</hi> as to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to prefer the Happiness of a <hi>wicked</hi> Soul before the <hi>Honour</hi> of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the <hi>Purity</hi> of his Nature; yet still there is an invincible Obstacle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, that renders her future Felicity impossible; and that is, that it cannot be without a plain Contradiction to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of <hi>Things.</hi> For as I have shewed you already, the <hi>Genius</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> of a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soul is wholly <hi>repugnant</hi> to all the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities of the <hi>other</hi> World; so that if they were set before her, She would not be able to <hi>enjoy</hi> them, but must be forced to <hi>pine</hi> and <hi>famish</hi> amidst all that <hi>Plenty</hi> of Delights, there being not one Viand in all the heavenly Banquet that she could relish any Sweetness in. Wherefore ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>her Nature</hi> must be changed, or the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Heaven;</hi> for while both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue what they are, they are <hi>irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable:</hi> and if God himself were so <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>indulgent,</hi> as to pass by all the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:34683:225"/>
in the <hi>other</hi> World which <hi>wicked</hi> Souls have offered him in <hi>this;</hi> yet he could not make them happy there, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out creating in them a <hi>new Heart,</hi> or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating for them a <hi>New Heaven.</hi> For it is altogether as possible for us to see with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Eyes,</hi> or hear without <hi>Ears,</hi> as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Heaven without a <hi>heavenly Disposition.</hi> How <hi>causelesly</hi> therefore dost thou presume, that talkest of going to <hi>Heaven,</hi> whilst thou continuest in thy <hi>Sin?</hi> Alass poor Wretch! What wouldst thou do there, if upon an <hi>impossible</hi> Supposition thou couldst be admitted into it? There are no <hi>wanton Amours</hi> among those heavenly Lovers, no Rivers of <hi>Wine</hi> among their Rivers of Pleasure, to gratifie thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded <hi>Sensuality;</hi> no Parasite to flatter thy <hi>lofty Pride,</hi> no Miseries to feed thy <hi>meager Envy,</hi> no Mischiefs to tickle thy <hi>devilish Revenge;</hi> but all the Felicities, with which that heavenly State abounds, are such as Thou wouldst <hi>loath</hi> and <hi>nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,</hi> as being too <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>refined</hi> for thy depraved Appetite: So that if thou wert in Heaven, it would be but a <hi>cooler Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> to thee; yea perhaps Hell it self would be less intolerable, than a Heaven so <hi>incongruous</hi> to thy Nature. And yet how ordinary is it for <hi>lewd</hi> and <hi>dissolute</hi>
                  <pb n="423" facs="tcp:34683:225"/>
Persons, to flatter themselves into <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Hopes</hi> of Heaven; for which, when they come to be examined they can give no other Reason but this, that they firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rely upon the <hi>Merits</hi> of their <hi>Saviour,</hi> who died for them, and obeyed God's Law in their stead; and therefore though they have no Righteousness of <hi>their own,</hi> yet they doubt not, being cloathed in the white Garment of <hi>Christ's,</hi> they shall be <hi>pardoned</hi> and <hi>accepted</hi> of God? Which is a Pretence so very <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>unreasonable,</hi> that one would think it were impossible for any Man to be imposed upon by it, that had not a Mind to deceive himself: for supposing what is false, that Christ did obey the Law in <hi>our stead,</hi> and that God doth account <hi>us</hi> righteous because <hi>He</hi> was so; yet what would this signifie to our Pardon and future Happiness, without an <hi>inherent</hi> Righteousness of <hi>our own;</hi> which is so necessary to our future Happiness, that Heaven it self cannot make us happy without it? For if by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>cloathed</hi> in the Robe of <hi>Christ's Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> we could be admitted into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; yet unless we left behind us our <hi>hellish Disposition,</hi> we should be <hi>miserable</hi> Wretches under that <hi>glorious</hi> Garment; in which we should be only crucified, like
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:34683:226"/>
                  <hi>Iesus</hi> in his purple Robe, with greater Scorn and Solemnity. For since the main of <hi>Heaven</hi> consists in the perfection of <hi>inherent</hi> Holiness, it necessarily follows that a mere <hi>imputable Holiness</hi> will only entitle us to an <hi>imputable Happiness,</hi> that is, to a mere imaginary Heaven; which how <hi>glorious</hi> soever it may look at a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> will when we come to embrace it glide from between our Arms, and leave us <hi>desperate</hi> and <hi>miserable.</hi> And though 'tis true, that Christ by his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion</hi> hath purchased for us Pardon and eternal Life; yet it is upon this <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> that we <hi>mortifie</hi> our Lusts, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> to the Rule of the <hi>Gospel:</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed without this, <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>eternal Life</hi> are Words that signifie nothing; for what doth a Pardon signifie to one that is dying of the Stone, or Strangury? He can but <hi>die,</hi> if he be <hi>not</hi> pardoned, and <hi>die</hi> he must though he <hi>be.</hi> And as little Advantage it would be to a <hi>depraved</hi> Soul, to be pardoned and absolved by God, while She hath a Disease <hi>within</hi> her that preys upon her Vitals, and hastens her to a <hi>certain Ruin:</hi> she could have been but <hi>miserable</hi> in the future Life, if she had <hi>not</hi> been pardoned; and <hi>miserable</hi> she must be, if she continue <hi>wicked,</hi> whether she
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:34683:226"/>
be <hi>pardoned,</hi> or <hi>no.</hi> All the Advantage that such a Soul could reap from God's pardoning her, would be only to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased from those <hi>arbitrary Punishments,</hi> which God may inflict on her in the world to come; but if she were freed from <hi>these,</hi> yet by a Necessity of <hi>Nature</hi> she must still be extreamly <hi>miserable;</hi> for her own <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness</hi> would incapacitate her for <hi>Heaven,</hi> and kindle a perpetual <hi>Hell</hi> within her. So that should Christ have died to obtain a Pardon for those that <hi>continue</hi> in their sin, he would have died to <hi>no purpose:</hi> for a <hi>wicked</hi> Soul <hi>cannot</hi> be pardoned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is such an <hi>inseparable</hi> Relation between <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Punishment,</hi> that it is as great a Contradiction for the <hi>one</hi> to be without the <hi>other,</hi> as for a <hi>Son</hi> to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Father.</hi> And then though Christ by his <hi>Death</hi> hath procured <hi>eternal Life,</hi> yet he cannot have procured it for those that are <hi>unreformed:</hi> because they, if they might, yet cannot <hi>enjoy</hi> it, their inward <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Disposition</hi> being <hi>contrary</hi> to it; so that unless Christ by his Death had altered the <hi>Nature</hi> of Heaven, and converted that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise of <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> Pleasures into a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raglio</hi> of <hi>brutish</hi> and <hi>carnal Enjoyments,</hi> he cannot have procured it for <hi>lewd</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved</hi> Souls. So that for any Man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:34683:227"/>
upon Heaven upon any account without <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Amendment,</hi> is the most egregious Nonsence in the World: For <hi>Heaven</hi> is nothing else but <hi>Holiness</hi> in its <hi>Perfection,</hi> freed from all those Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances that here do perpetually clog and annoy it; so that a Heaven without <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> is a Heaven without a <hi>Heaven,</hi> that is, a Word that signifies nothing, a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness wholly abstracted from it self. While therefore we flatter our selves with the Hopes of a <hi>future Bliss,</hi> continuing in our <hi>Sins,</hi> we do but court a <hi>painted Heaven,</hi> and woo <hi>Happiness</hi> in a <hi>Picture;</hi> but in the mean time are sinking into a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real Hell,</hi> where all our <hi>foolish Hopes</hi> will be swallowed up for ever, in our woful Experience of its <hi>substantial Miseries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>II. WE may discern from hence the <hi>indispensable</hi> Necessity of <hi>Mortification,</hi> since it is plain we can't be <hi>happy</hi> without it: so that to mortify our <hi>Lusts</hi> is just as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for us, as it is to obtain <hi>Heaven,</hi> and avoid <hi>Hell.</hi> For <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> are the Foundations of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell; Hell</hi> is nothing but that Hemisphere of <hi>Darkness,</hi> in which all <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedness</hi> moves; and Heaven is the opposite He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere of <hi>Light,</hi> the glorious Orb of <hi>Holiness, Truth,</hi> and <hi>Goodness;</hi> and in the
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:34683:227"/>
Possession of the <hi>one,</hi> or the <hi>other,</hi> we do all of us actually enstate our selves in <hi>this</hi> Life. For take <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Vertue</hi> out of Heaven, and all its Glories will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately be <hi>clouded</hi> in horrid Darkness, and <hi>overcast</hi> with the dismal Shades of Hell: Take <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedness</hi> out of Hell, and all its blackness of Darkness will vanish, and it will presently <hi>clear</hi> up into Light and Serenity, and <hi>shine</hi> out into a glorious Heaven. For 'tis not so much the <hi>Place,</hi> as the <hi>State</hi> that makes either the <hi>one,</hi> or the <hi>other;</hi> and the State of Heaven and Hell consists in perfect <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Wickedness;</hi> and proportionably as we do improve in either of these, so we do approach towards Heaven, or Hell. For as <hi>Heaven</hi> is the Center of all that is <hi>vertuous, pure,</hi> and <hi>holy;</hi> and every thing that is <hi>good</hi> tends thither by a <hi>natural</hi> Sympathy: so <hi>Hell</hi> is the Center of all <hi>Impiety</hi> and <hi>Wickedness;</hi> and whatsoever is <hi>bad</hi> doth naturally press and sink down thither, as towards its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Place</hi> and <hi>Element.</hi> And should not the divine Vengeance concern it self in <hi>excluding</hi> wicked Souls out of Heaven, yet their <hi>own Wickedness</hi> would do it; for that is a Place of such <hi>inaccessible Light</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> that nothing that is <hi>impure</hi> or <hi>wicked</hi> can approach it; but must of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:34683:228"/>
be beaten off by the <hi>perpetual Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> of its Glory, and tumbled headlong down as oft as ever it essays to climb up into it. As on the other hand, should not God by an immediate Vengeance <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate</hi> wicked Souls into Hell; yet their own <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedness,</hi> hastened by the mighty Weight of its own <hi>Nature,</hi> would necessarily hurry them down thither with a most <hi>swift</hi> and <hi>headlong</hi> Motion. And if this be so, then questionless it is as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for us not to <hi>continue</hi> in our Sin, as it is not to be <hi>excluded</hi> out of Heaven, nor <hi>thrust down</hi> into the flames of Hell: and did we but <hi>know</hi> what this meant, doubtless we should run away from our <hi>Sins</hi> in a greater Fright and Maze, than ever we did from the most <hi>astonishing Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</hi> For consider, O Man, by those <hi>short Pleasures</hi> with which thou treatest thy lusts, thou excommunicatest thy self from <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ioy;</hi> and wouldst thou be but so wise as to deny thy self the Pleasure of a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> thou mightst be pleased <hi>for ever,</hi> and millions of <hi>Ages</hi> hence be rejoycing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>blessed Spirits,</hi> because thou wouldst not gratify thy self with those <hi>fulsom Delights,</hi> which would have died away in the Enjoyment. And is it possible thou shouldst be so besotted, as
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:34683:228"/>
to exchange the Pleasures of an <hi>immortal Heaven,</hi> for those of an <hi>intemperate Draught,</hi> to sell the Joys of <hi>Angels</hi> for the Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of an <hi>Harlot,</hi> and pawn thy Part in <hi>Paradise</hi> for a little <hi>Money,</hi> of which e'er long thou wilt have no other Use, but only to purchase six foot of Earth, and a Winding-sheet? O most prodigious Folly! What account canst thou give for such an <hi>extravagant Bargain,</hi> at the Tribunal of thy own <hi>Reason?</hi> But it may be you will say; <hi>What doth the loss of Heaven signify, since</hi> (as you have told us already) <hi>if we could be admitted to it, it could be no Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us? And why should we think much of losing that which we cannot enjoy?</hi> To which I answer; 'Tis true, you cannot <hi>enjoy</hi> it, unless you part with your <hi>Lusts;</hi> because <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>they</hi> are <hi>inconsistent:</hi> but you may part with your <hi>Lusts,</hi> if you <hi>will,</hi> and being quit of <hi>these,</hi> you may and shall <hi>enjoy</hi> it for ever. Your <hi>Sin</hi> is the only Wall of <hi>Separation</hi> between <hi>you</hi> and <hi>Heaven;</hi> which being once demolished, you may <hi>enter</hi> into it without any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and take <hi>Possession</hi> of all its Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. So that if you think the Loss of <hi>Heaven</hi> will be no <hi>Trouble</hi> to you in the other World, because it is <hi>such</hi> a Heaven as your <hi>depraved</hi> Souls will be <hi>averse</hi> to,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:34683:229"/>
you are infinitely mistaken; for though you <hi>will</hi> be <hi>averse</hi> to it, yet your own <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences</hi> will tell you, that if you <hi>would,</hi> you might have <hi>conquer'd</hi> that Aversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as those <hi>blessed Spirits</hi> that do enjoy it; and that if you had done so, <hi>you</hi> might have been infinitely <hi>happy</hi> as well as <hi>they.</hi> Whereas now you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to wander for ever in a <hi>woful Eternity,</hi> tormented with a <hi>restless</hi> Rage, and <hi>hungry unsatisfied</hi> Desire after these <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Goods</hi> you have left behind you, and to which you shall never return more; the Consideration of which will render the Loss of Heaven as <hi>grievous</hi> to you, as if it were a Heaven over-flowing with <hi>sensual</hi> Delights, and abounding with <hi>such Ioys,</hi> as you will then hunger after, but can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enjoy. For how will it sting you to the heart, when you shall thus ruminate with your selves, as you are wandring through the Infernal Shades; <hi>Ah besotted Fool that I am! now I see too late, that Heaven is a state wherein a Soul may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely happy; look how yonder blessed Spirits are imparadised! how they exult and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph! how they sing and give praise, and are rapt into extasies of love and joy! whilst I through my own Sensuality and Devilishness am utterly incapable of those sublime Delights,</hi>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:34683:229"/>
                  <hi>whereof their Heaven is composed; and like a forlorn Wretch, am left for ever destitute of those sensual pleasures, which are the only Heaven I can now enjoy.</hi> And therefore as you would not spend an Eternity in such <hi>direful Reflections,</hi> and have those <hi>dismal Thoughts</hi> like so many Vulturs preying upon you for ever; be persuaded to set persently upon this <hi>great</hi> and <hi>necessary</hi> Work of <hi>Mortification.</hi> For assure your selves, God will as soon let <hi>Hell</hi> loose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and people the Regions of <hi>immortal Bliss</hi> with the Inhabitants of the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Darkness;</hi> as crown a <hi>wicked</hi> Soul with the glorious Reward of <hi>eternal Life.</hi> For God hath reduced us to this issue, either our <hi>Sins,</hi> or our <hi>Souls</hi> must die; and we must shake hands with <hi>Heaven,</hi> or our <hi>Lusts:</hi> so that unless we value <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happiness</hi> so little, as to exchange it for the <hi>sordid</hi> and <hi>trifling</hi> Pleasures of <hi>Sin;</hi> and unless we love our <hi>Sins</hi> so well, as to ransom them with the blood of our immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Souls;</hi> it concerns us speedily to shake off our <hi>sins</hi> by <hi>Repentance:</hi> for this is an <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>immutable</hi> Law, that if we will be <hi>wicked,</hi> we must be <hi>miserable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>III. FROM hence we may perceive, what is the only <hi>true</hi> and <hi>solid</hi> Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>Assurance</hi> of Heaven, namely,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:34683:230"/>
our <hi>mortifying</hi> the Deeds of the Body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for if <hi>they that mortify the deeds of the body shall live,</hi> then if we do, or have <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi> them, we are sure that we are enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to <hi>eternal Life.</hi> So that to be <hi>assured</hi> of Heaven, we need not go about to spell out our Names in the <hi>Stars,</hi> or to read them in the secret Volumes of <hi>eternal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination:</hi> for if <hi>our</hi> Wills be but so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued to the Will of <hi>God,</hi> that we do not live in any <hi>wilful Violation</hi> of his Laws; we may be as certainly persuaded of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in <hi>eternal Life,</hi> as if one of the winged Messengers from above should come down and tell us, that he saw our <hi>Names</hi> enrolled in the Volumes of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> For besides that God hath <hi>promised</hi> Heaven to us upon condition of our <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,</hi> we shall, when our <hi>Lusts</hi> are throughly <hi>subdued,</hi> feel Heaven opening it self within us, and rising up from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Souls in a <hi>Divine</hi> Life and <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> Nature: so that we shall not need to seek for Heaven <hi>without</hi> us, because we shall find it already come down <hi>into</hi> us, and transcribed into our own <hi>Natures.</hi> And as we <hi>grow</hi> in Grace from one degree to another, so Heaven will break forth <hi>clearer</hi> and <hi>clearer</hi> upon us; and the nearer we approach to the top of the <hi>Hill,</hi> the fuller
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:34683:230"/>
View we shall have of the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and extended <hi>Sky;</hi> till at last we come to walk all along in sight of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and to travel towards it in a full <hi>View</hi> and <hi>Assurance</hi> of it. But if we <hi>secure</hi> our selves of <hi>Heaven,</hi> before we have <hi>mortifyed</hi> our <hi>Lusts,</hi> we do but entertain our <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> with a <hi>golden</hi> Dream; which when we awake will vanish away, and leave us <hi>desperate</hi> and <hi>miserable.</hi> If therefore we would be <hi>assured</hi> of our future <hi>Happiness,</hi> let us not trouble our selves with nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Signs</hi> of <hi>Grace;</hi> nor go about to erect <hi>Schemes</hi> of our spiritual <hi>Nativity,</hi> to cast a Figure to know whether we have Grace, or were converted <hi>secundùm artem:</hi> but let us impartially examine, whether <hi>our Wills</hi> are so <hi>subdued</hi> to the <hi>Will</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as universally to <hi>choose</hi> what he <hi>enjoins,</hi> and <hi>refuse</hi> what he <hi>forbids.</hi> For if they <hi>are,</hi> our Condition is <hi>good,</hi> and our Hope <hi>secure,</hi> by what Means or Motives so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was effected; and whether they <hi>are</hi> or <hi>no,</hi> we need no <hi>Marks</hi> or <hi>Signs</hi> to resolve us: for our <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Resolutions</hi> and <hi>Intentions</hi> are <hi>Signs</hi> enough to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and we need no <hi>Marks</hi> to know what it is that we choose and refuse: this our <hi>Soul</hi> can easily discern by that <hi>innate Power</hi> she hath of reflecting upon
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:34683:231"/>
our own Motions, by which she doth as naturally feel her own <hi>Deliberations</hi> and <hi>Volitions,</hi> as the <hi>Body</hi> doth its <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> and <hi>Thirst.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, <hi>holy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spositions,</hi> like all other <hi>Motions,</hi> the <hi>weaker</hi> they are, and the more they are <hi>interrupted</hi> by contrary Motions and Inclinations, the <hi>less</hi> they will be <hi>perceived;</hi> which is the Reason, why <hi>Beginners</hi> in Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so <hi>sensible</hi> of the Grace that is in them; because their <hi>good</hi> Inclinations are <hi>checked</hi> and <hi>hindred</hi> by the strong and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Counter-Motions of their <hi>Lusts:</hi> but the more their <hi>good</hi> Inclinations <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail</hi> and <hi>free</hi> themselves from these <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> Inclinations which clog and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them, the more their Souls will be <hi>sensible</hi> of them. For this we find by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that as we perceive our own motions, the more <hi>vigorous</hi> they are, the more we <hi>perceive</hi> them; especially when they are <hi>advised</hi> and <hi>deliberate,</hi> as all <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> Motions and Inclinations are. For that a Man should be <hi>insensible</hi> of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he exerts <hi>advisedly,</hi> or not be able to <hi>know</hi> that he is so disposed, when he is <hi>knowingly</hi> so disposed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a <hi>Contradiction:</hi> and indeed, if we are not able to know when we <hi>choose</hi> and <hi>refuse,</hi> as we should when we <hi>resolve</hi> well
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:34683:231"/>
and <hi>intend</hi> aright, we cannot discern when we <hi>do</hi> right or wrong; but are left to a Necessity of acting at <hi>random;</hi> like Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers in the dark, that go on at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture without knowing whether they go backward or forward. If we cannot know when we do well, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we should know <hi>how</hi> to do well; but must necessarily leave the Conduct of our Actions to <hi>Chance,</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> must determine us unto <hi>Right</hi> or <hi>Wrong.</hi> Since therefore our <hi>Soul</hi> is not a <hi>senseless</hi> Machin that hath <hi>no Perception</hi> of her own Motions, but is naturally <hi>sensible</hi> of whatsoever is transacted within her; let us no longer excuse our <hi>Ignorance</hi> of our own Condition with that common Pretence, that our <hi>Hearts</hi> are <hi>deceitful</hi> and <hi>hypocritical:</hi> for our <hi>Hearts</hi> are our <hi>selves,</hi> and if <hi>they</hi> are <hi>deceitful</hi> and <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical,</hi> we our <hi>selves</hi> are so. And yet I know not how it comes to pass, it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses among some Men for a great Sign of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Sincerity,</hi> to complain of the <hi>Falseness</hi> and <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> of their own <hi>Hearts;</hi> not considering that <hi>Men</hi> are as their <hi>Hearts</hi> are, and that if <hi>these</hi> are Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical, they <hi>themselves</hi> are Hypocrites. If therefore our Complaint be <hi>true,</hi> the more Shame for us: this is so far from
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:34683:232"/>
being a Sign that we have <hi>Grace,</hi> that it is a plain Confession that we are <hi>graceless Dissemblers.</hi> If our Complaint be <hi>false,</hi> we falsely accuse our selves in it; which is also so far from being a Sign of <hi>Grace,</hi> that it is an Argument only of our own <hi>extravagant Folly.</hi> But if we <hi>mistake</hi> in our Complaint, and think that to be <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> which is not, we should seek to be better <hi>informed:</hi> and if when you are <hi>so,</hi> you <hi>still</hi> complain of your <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,</hi> I doubt you have too much <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> for it; and if <hi>you fear</hi> that you are Hypocrites, <hi>I fear</hi> you are so too. For why should one that <hi>knows</hi> what an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite is, <hi>fear</hi> that he is an Hypocrite; were he not <hi>conscious</hi> to himself, that he doth dissemble with God, and under an open <hi>Pretence</hi> of <hi>submitting</hi> to him, <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise</hi> some secret Purpose of <hi>rebelling</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him? Let us therefore lay aside all our <hi>impertinent</hi> Scrupulosity, and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examine our own Souls, whether we do submit to God without any <hi>reserve,</hi> and are willing to lay down all our <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Lusts</hi> at his Feet: for whether we <hi>are</hi> or no, we may easily discern if we <hi>will.</hi> If we <hi>are,</hi> then are the <hi>Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> already laid within our
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:34683:232"/>
own Bosoms; and if upon this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple we grow in <hi>Grace,</hi> and add one Degree of <hi>Vertue</hi> to another, we may be sure the <hi>Superstructure</hi> will go on, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the whole <hi>Fabrick</hi> of our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is compleated. For as <hi>Nature</hi> by its powerful Magick is continually draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing unto its proper <hi>Place,</hi> and <hi>Center;</hi> so <hi>Heaven</hi> attracts to it self, and freely imbosoms every thing that is <hi>heavenly;</hi> and thrusts off nothing but what is <hi>unfit</hi> for and <hi>heterogeneous</hi> to it. If therefore our <hi>Souls</hi> be of a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> Temper, <hi>Heaven</hi> is the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of our Motions, and the <hi>proper</hi> Place whereunto we belong; and whither at last we shall safely arrive, in despite of all those dismal Shades of Darkness, that would beat us back, and interrupt our Progress towards it: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if we <hi>secure</hi> our selves of <hi>Heaven</hi> while we are <hi>enslaved</hi> to any <hi>Lusts,</hi> we presume <hi>unreasonably;</hi> and embark our Hopes in a <hi>leaky Bottom,</hi> which in stress of Weather will certainly <hi>founder</hi> under us, and <hi>sink</hi> us into utter <hi>Despair:</hi> For how can we hope to be admitted into <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> whilst we retain that within our own <hi>Bosoms</hi> which kindles <hi>Hell,</hi> and is
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:34683:233"/>
the <hi>Spring</hi> of the Lake of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone?</hi> This would be a <hi>confounding</hi> of utter Darkness with the Regions of Light, a <hi>blending</hi> of Heaven and Hell to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and Lastly, FROM hence it appears what is the <hi>great Design</hi> of the Christian Religion. We may be sure, God would not have sent his <hi>Son</hi> into the World, had not the <hi>Embassy</hi> upon which he was employed been of the <hi>highest Moment</hi> and <hi>Concernment</hi> to us: And what other <hi>End,</hi> besides doing the <hi>greatest</hi> Good, could a <hi>good</hi> God propose in so <hi>great</hi> a Transaction? Surely had we been in Heaven, when the <hi>Holy One</hi> descended thence into the World, though we had not known the <hi>Particulars</hi> of his Errand, yet we should have concluded that doubtless he was employed upon some <hi>great</hi> Design of <hi>Love;</hi> to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate from the Almighty Father some <hi>mighty Blessing</hi> to the World: and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we find, that though the <hi>holy Angels</hi> did not comprehend the <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Intention,</hi> and <hi>Mystery</hi> of Christ's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation; yet they concluded in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that it was intended for some <hi>great</hi> Good to the World; as is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:34683:233"/>
by the Anthem they sung at his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, <hi>Glory be to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God on high, on Earth peace, good will towards Men.</hi> Now the greatest Expression of God's <hi>good Will</hi> towards Men is to <hi>rescue</hi> them from all <hi>Iniquity,</hi> and restore them to the <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Perfection</hi> of their Natures: for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>this</hi> all the Blessings of Heaven, and Earth are not <hi>sufficient</hi> to make us <hi>happy.</hi> While our Nature is <hi>debauch'd</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with unreasonable <hi>Lusts</hi> and <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,</hi> we must be <hi>miserable,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that an Omnipotent Goodness can do for us: for <hi>Misery</hi> is so essential to <hi>Sin,</hi> that we may as well be <hi>Men</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being <hi>reasonable,</hi> as <hi>sinful</hi> Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being <hi>miserable.</hi> Since therefore the <hi>End</hi> of Christ's coming into the World was to dispense God's <hi>greatest Blessings</hi> to Mankind; and since the <hi>greatest Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> that we can receive from God, is to be <hi>redeemed</hi> by his Grace from our <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi> and to be made <hi>Partakers</hi> of the <hi>Divine Nature;</hi> we may reasonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that <hi>this</hi> was his main <hi>Design</hi> in the World, and the great <hi>End</hi> of that everlasting <hi>Gospel</hi> which he revealed to it. And hence the name <hi>Iesus</hi> was given him by the Direction of an Angel, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:34683:234"/>
he should <hi>save his people from their Sins:</hi> Matth. i. 21. and indeed I cannot imagine any Design whatsoever, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>this,</hi> that could be worthy the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi>'s coming down into the World, to live such a <hi>miserable</hi> Life, and die such a <hi>shameful</hi> Death. Had it been only to save us from a <hi>Plague,</hi> or <hi>War</hi> or <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> it had been an Undertaking fit for the <hi>lowest Angel</hi> in the heavenly Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy: but to save us from our <hi>sins</hi> was an Enterprize so <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> as <hi>none</hi> in Heaven or Earth, but the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himself, was thought <hi>worthy</hi> to be employed in. This therefore was the <hi>Mark</hi> of all his <hi>Aims</hi> while he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, the <hi>Center</hi> in which all his <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> met, to save us from our <hi>Sins,</hi> and to inspire us with a <hi>divine</hi> Life and <hi>God-like</hi> Nature; that thereby we might be <hi>disposed</hi> for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and made to be <hi>meet Partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> 'Tis true, he died to procure our <hi>Pardon</hi> too; but it was with respect to a farther <hi>End,</hi> namely that we might not grow <hi>desperate</hi> with the Sense of our <hi>Guilts;</hi> but that by the Promise of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which he hath <hi>purchased</hi> for us, we
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:34683:234"/>
might be encouraged to <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>amend.</hi> But should he have procured a <hi>Pardon</hi> for our Sin, whether we had <hi>repented</hi> of it or <hi>no;</hi> he would have only <hi>skinned</hi> over a Wound, which if it be not perfectly <hi>cured,</hi> will rankle of its own accord into an incurable <hi>Gangrene.</hi> Christ therefore by the offering of himself is said <hi>to purge our consciences from dead works, that we might serve the living God:</hi> Heb. ix. 14. and the great Apostle makes the <hi>ultimate</hi> Intention of his giving himself for us to be this, <hi>that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himself a peculiar people zealous of good works:</hi> Tit. ii. 14. And until his <hi>Death</hi> hath had <hi>this</hi> Effect upon us, it is not all the Merit of his <hi>Blood,</hi> and Vertue of his <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> that can <hi>release</hi> us from the direful <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of the other Life. For unless he by his <hi>Death</hi> had so altered the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> as that it might be in us without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Plague</hi> to us; it must necessarily, if we carry it with us into the other World, prove a perpetual <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Torment</hi> to us. So that it is apparent, that the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>ultimate</hi> Design of Christ, was not to <hi>hide</hi> our filthy sores, but to <hi>heal</hi> and <hi>cure</hi> them: and for this End it was that he revealed

to us the <hi>grace of God</hi> from Heaven, <hi>to teach us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, and righteously, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this present world.</hi> Tit. ii. 12. Let us not therefore <hi>cheat</hi> our own Souls, by thinking that the <hi>Gospel</hi> requires nothing of us, but only to be holy by <hi>Proxy,</hi> righteous by being cloathed in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>another's Righteousness;</hi> as if its Design was not so much to <hi>cure,</hi> as <hi>cover</hi> our filthy Sores, not to make us <hi>whole,</hi> but to make us <hi>accounted</hi> so. For can any Man imagin, that Christ would ever have undertaken such a mighty Design, and made so great a noise of doing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; which when it is all summed up is nothing but a <hi>Notion,</hi> and doth not at last amount unto a <hi>Reality?</hi> As if the great Design of his coming down from Heaven to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>die</hi> for us, was only to make a <hi>Cloak</hi> for our <hi>sins,</hi> wherein we might <hi>appear</hi> righteous before God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>being</hi> so. But do not deceive your selves; it is not all the <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> of Christ's Life, nor all the <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Merit</hi> of his Death, that can render you <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> in God's eyes; unless you <hi>really</hi> are so: and you may as well be <hi>Well</hi> with another's Health, or <hi>wise</hi> with
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:34683:235"/>
another's Wisdom, as <hi>righteous</hi> before God with the Righteousness of Christ, while you <hi>abide</hi> in your <hi>Sins.</hi> For God sees you as you <hi>are;</hi> and the most glorious <hi>Disguise</hi> you can appear in before him will never be able to delude his all-seeing Eye, so as to make him account you <hi>righteous</hi> when you are <hi>not:</hi> and if it were possible for you to impose upon <hi>God,</hi> yet unless you could also impose upon the <hi>Nature</hi> of Things, and by <hi>fancying</hi> them to be otherwise than they <hi>are,</hi> make them to <hi>be</hi> what they are <hi>not,</hi> it will be to no purpose. For if you could be cloathed in <hi>Christ's Righteousness,</hi> while you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue <hi>wicked;</hi> it would signifie no more to your <hi>Happiness,</hi> than it would to be cloathed in a most <hi>splendid</hi> Garment, while you were pining with <hi>Famine,</hi> or tortured with the <hi>Gout</hi> or <hi>Strangury.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as we love our own <hi>Souls,</hi> and would not betray our selves into an <hi>irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ruin,</hi> let us firmly conclude with our selves, that the great Design of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is <hi>internal Holiness</hi> and <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> and that without <hi>this,</hi> all that Christ hath <hi>done</hi> and <hi>suffered</hi> for us will be so far from contributing to our <hi>Happiness,</hi> that it will prove an eternal Aggravation to
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:34683:236"/>
our <hi>Misery;</hi> and that all that precious <hi>Blood,</hi> which he shed in our behalf, will be so far from obtaining <hi>Pardon</hi> and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Happiness</hi> for us, that it will arise in <hi>Iudgment</hi> against us; and like the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> instead of interceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us, will cry down <hi>Vengance</hi> from Heaven upon us. For how can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy Iesus,</hi> who hated our <hi>Sins</hi> more than all the <hi>Pangs</hi> and Horrors of a woful Death, should all of a sudden be so <hi>kind</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> as to give them <hi>Shelter</hi> and <hi>Sanctuary</hi> within his own <hi>meritorious</hi> Wounds; and to make his <hi>Blood</hi> the Price of a general <hi>Indulgence</hi> to all <hi>Impiety</hi> and <hi>Wickedness,</hi> that so we might sin <hi>securely,</hi> and enjoy a safe <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat</hi> from his Authority under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert of his <hi>Sacrifice?</hi> But be not deceived; the holy <hi>Iesus</hi> will never make himself an <hi>unholy Saviour</hi> for your sake; and your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called by the Name of <hi>Christ</hi> is so far from giving you a <hi>Priviledge</hi> to <hi>sin,</hi> that it lays you under a stricter <hi>Restraint;</hi> and if you <hi>violate</hi> it, it will expose you to a <hi>severer</hi> Punishment, than if you had been <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Infidels.</hi> For this is the great Proposal of our Religion, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> died to purchase <hi>Pardon,</hi>
                  <pb n="445" facs="tcp:34683:236"/>
and <hi>eternal Life,</hi> for all that do <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>amend;</hi> but if we still go on in our <hi>Sin,</hi> we are at a greater <hi>distance</hi> from <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>eternal Life,</hi> than if we never had had a <hi>Saviour</hi> to undertake for us.</p>
