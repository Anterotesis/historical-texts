            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>THere was a fair Maid at <hi>Islington,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>as I heard many tell,</l>
               <l>And she would to fair <hi>London</hi> go</l>
               <l>fine Apples and Pears to sell:</l>
               <l>And as she pass'd along the Street,</l>
               <l>with her Basket on her arm,</l>
               <l>There did she with a Uintner meet,</l>
               <l>this fair Maid thought no harm.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Good morrow, fair Maid, the Uintner said,</l>
               <l>What have you got here to sell?</l>
               <l>Fine Apples &amp; Pears, kind Sir, she said,</l>
               <l>if you please to taste them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> well.</l>
               <l>He tasted of this fair Maid's Fruit,</l>
               <l>and he lik'd it wondrous well;</l>
               <l>And then he crav'd of this fair Maid,</l>
               <l>how many a penny she'd sell.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>

               <l>Sir, here you shall have six, she said,</l>
               <l>and here you shall have ten;</l>
               <l>I sold no more, but just before,</l>
               <l>to some Inns of Court Gentlemen.</l>
               <l>Now while he by the Damsel staid,</l>
               <l>her Body he did eye,</l>
               <l>At length he crav'd of this fair Maid,</l>
               <l>one night with him to lie:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thy Beauty doth so please my eye,</l>

               <l>That now of all my Liberty,</l>
               <l>I am deprived quite:</l>
               <l>And therefore Love be kind to me,</l>
               <l>and let us toy and play,</l>
               <l>It is but one small Courtesie,</l>
               <l>then do not say me nay.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Sir, if you lye with me one night,</l>
               <l>as you propound to me,</l>
               <l>I do expect that you should prove</l>
               <l>both courteous, kind, and free:</l>
               <l>And for to tell you all in short,</l>
               <l>it will cost you Five Pound.</l>
               <l>A match, a match, the Uintner said,</l>
               <l>and so let this go round.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>When he had layn with her all night,</l>
               <l>her Money she did crave:</l>
               <l>O stay, quoth he, the other night,</l>
               <l>and thy Money thou shalt have.</l>
               <l>I cannot stay, nor I will not stay,</l>
               <l>I needs must now begone,</l>
               <l>Why then thou maist thy Money go look,</l>
               <l>for Money I'll pay thee none.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This Maid she made no more ado,</l>
               <l>but to a Iustice went,</l>
               <l>And unto him she made her moan,</l>
               <l>who did her Case lam<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>nt:</l>
               <l>She said she had a Celler let out,</l>
               <l>to a Uintner in the Town,</l>
               <l>And how that he did then agree,</l>
               <l>Five Pound to pay her down:</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But now, quoth she, the case is such,</l>
               <l>no Rent that he will pay,</l>
               <l>Therefore your Worship I beseech,</l>
               <l>to send for him this day.</l>
               <l>Then streight the Iustice for him sent,</l>
               <l>and ask'd the reason why,</l>
               <l>That he would pay this Maid no Rent;</l>
               <l>to which he did reply,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Although I hired a Cellar of her,</l>
               <l>and the Possion was mine,</l>
               <l>I ne'er put any thing into it</l>
               <l>but one poor Pipe of Wine;</l>
               <l>Therefore my Bargain it was hard,</l>
               <l>as you may plainly see,</l>
               <l>I from my Freedom was debar'd;</l>
               <l>then good Sir favour me.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This fair Maid being ripe of Wit,</l>
               <l>she streight reply'd agen,</l>
               <l>There was two Butts lay at the Door,</l>
               <l>why did you not rowl them in?</l>
               <l>You had your Freedom and your Will,</l>
               <l>as is to you well known,</l>
               <l>Therefore I do desire still</l>
               <l>for to receive my own.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Iustice hearing of thier Case,</l>
               <l>did there give order straight,</l>
               <l>That he the Money should pay down,</l>
               <l>she should no longer wait:</l>
               <l>Withal he told the Uintner plain,</l>
               <l>if he a Tennant be,</l>
               <l>He must expect to pay the same,</l>
               <l>for he could not sit Rent-free.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But when her Money she had got,</l>
               <l>she put it into her Purse,</l>
               <l>And clapt her hand on the Celler-door,</l>
               <l>and said it was never the worse:</l>
               <l>Which caus'd the People all to laugh</l>
               <l>to see this Uintner fine,</l>
               <l>Out-witted by a Country Girl</l>
               <l>about his Pipe of Wine.</l>
