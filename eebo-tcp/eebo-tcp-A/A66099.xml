         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Epiſtle (as is to be ſeen by the Title or Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it) was directed to Chriſtians diſperſed
and ſcattered up and down the World. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were the remainder of the <hi>Babyloniſh
Captivity,</hi> who returned not with their Brethren into <hi>Indea;</hi>
or the diſperſion occaſioned by the cruelty of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> in
the dayes of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> of which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Heb.

after the death of <hi>Stephen:</hi> recorded <hi>Act. 8. beginning</hi> (to
each of which Interpreters do differently incline) I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
not. But they were ſuch as laboured under the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of <hi>manifold afflictions,</hi> as appears from <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. v. 6. <hi>now,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>you are in heavineſs through many Temptations.</hi> For their

               </gap> and encouragement our Apoſtle doth in every Chapter
commix ſome conſolatory and wholſome adviſe to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and animate them to patience, and help their perfeiting:
and in the latter part of this Chapter, beginning at this <hi>12th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
verſe, he more particularly counſels, and quickens them about
this matter.</p>
            <p>Theſe words are introductory to the diſcourſe, and taken by
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100132:4"/>
themſelves (and we need not at preſent look further) do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
an Exhortation or Direction, how to entertain the great
Tryals that were like to come upon them; or rather a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and negative injunction, or a prohibition, reſpecting the
obſervation they ſhould make of, and inference they might
draw from thoſe troubles. In the words obſerve.</p>
            <p>1. The Compellation, <hi>Beloved:</hi> The afflictions of the
Saints ſhould not alienate our affections from them, or render
them any whit leſs amiable in our eyes: there is no reaſon
why our love ſhould abate, or hearts grow ſtrange to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God, becauſe they are perſecuted and hated by the
World. Jeſus Chriſt loves them, and declares them bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 10. and if they are beloved by Chriſt, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it of us, if we would be like him: nay their ſufferings
are for Chriſt, and on that ſcore ought they to be dear to us,
as they ſtand up for his honour: nay and they are for the
Church of Chriſt too, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 24. we have our ſhare in the
benefit, which challengeth for them a ſhare in our love.</p>
            <p>2. The ſubject matter about which the Exhortation is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>viz. the Fiery Tryal:</hi> the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) ſignifies burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ſo it is Tranſlated, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 9. Thus alſo ſome render
it here. It deſigns the more ſharp and ſevere exerciſes of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
ſuch as are occaſioned by the violent oppreſſion and
perſecution of Enemies, which are frequently in Scripture
Phraſe expreſſed by the Metaphor of Fire, from the manifold
reſemblance which is between them: it is here tranſlated <hi>Fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Tryal,</hi> reſpecting the end which God looks at in ordering
it to befal his people, and that is further expreſſed and ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the deſcription; <hi>which is to try you;</hi> the Greek is, <hi>which
befals you for a temptation or tryal,</hi> intimating to us the great
deſign of God in all, even the ſevereſt Afflictions which his
Children ſuffer; nor is it a vain Tautologie, but a needful
amplification; fleſh and blood being very ready to count of it
as rather to deſtroy, then to prove their Faith.</p>
            <p>3. The Exhortation it ſelf; <hi>Think it not ſtrange,</hi> the word
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100132:4"/>
is, be ye not like to Gheſts or Strangers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it is uſed for
thoſe which are troubled with admiration at ſome new and
ſtrange thing. The Apoſtle therefore expounds himſelf at
the latter end of the verſe: <hi>As if ſome ſtrange thing had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto you..</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Or, <hi>as if a stranger came to you:</hi> ſo ſome read it: and
his meaning is, that they ſhould not entertain it as a thing
which they had no expectation of, and were thereupon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with wonder and ſurprize at the coming of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here endeavour to expreſs all that might uſefully
be obſerved from the words, but among many Truths that
might hence be treated of, make choice of that comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
one, for our preſent meditation. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>It becomes not the people of God to look upon the fiery
tryal which befals the Church of Chriſt in the world, as a ſtrange
thing.</hi> We may take up the Explication in three things:
1. What is meant by fiery tryals? 2. What it is to count
them ſtrange? 3. The ground of the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>1. What is meant by fiery Tryals?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> Tryals in propriety of ſpeech, are ſuch experiments as
are made, for the finding out of the nature, qualities, and
operation of things, when they are applied, in our ſpeech, to
rational agents, they then intend, either an Eſſay or Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to draw, and by Arguments to perſwade men to any
thing which we have a deſign to make uſe of them in, and ſo
they are called temptations, and in which ſence mainly, the
Devil is called the Tempter, becauſe he uſeth all endeavours
to inſinuate into, and gain men to follow his ſuggeſtions: or
elſe a proof which we are minded to make of the fidelity,
ſincerity, and conſtancy which is in a perſon, that we may
know him the better, and ſo they are more peculiarly called
Tryals: in this ſence it is ſaid, A wiſe man will try before he
will truſt; thus God put <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith and obedience to the
tryal, <hi>Gen. 22. beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100132:5"/>
Afflictions in Scripture language often bear the name of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
becauſe by them proof is made of Profeſſors, and men are
tried ſo as to be diſcovered, oftentimes, whither they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſincere or hypocritical; and indeed it is one of the beſt
evidences we can have of mens integrity, when theſe drive
them not from, but eſtabliſh them in their profeſſion.</p>
            <p>When the Epithete <hi>Fiery,</hi> is added to tryals, it ſerves to
denote ſuch afflictions as are the moſt ſharp and ſevere, and
do the moſt of all put a Chriſtians conſtancy to the teſt: and
among theſe, the Apoſtle (as by our Context is manifeſt)
doth here intend, ſuch as are occaſioned by perſecution; thoſe
things which the people of God are called to ſuffer in defenſe
of the Goſpel, againſt the cruelty of raging Enemies; of
which ſort are impriſonments, ſtripes, revilings, exile, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation
of goods, and the like: theſe are called fiery, meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically,
becauſe ſuch is the pain, grief, and trouble which
they put the mind of man to, and ſometimes his body alſo, as
render them exceeding difficult to bear; and becauſe as fire
they ſerve to purge and cleanſe them from many pollutions:
yea, and ſometimes they are ſo termed Properly, becauſe the
Perſecutors of the Church, do often proſecute the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of Jeſus Chriſt with Fire and Fagot: and they are
called Tryals, becauſe (whatſoever the Inſtruments of them
aim at in executing them upon the people of God) they are
deſigned by God himſelf, who is the Soveraign and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
diſpoſer of all things, to be probationary, and uſed as
a Refiners fire to purge out the droſs, and not to waſt the good
mettal which is caſt into it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
            <p>2. What it is to count them ſtrange?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> We look upon ſuch things to be ſtrange, which are,</p>
            <p>1. Things unuſual, and with which we have no acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
ſuch things as rarely happen, as ſcarce come once in
an age, are eſteemed to be ſtrange things: a man whom we
never or ſeldome ſaw before, and with whom we have not
taken up any familiarity or friendſhip, is uſually counted and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100132:5"/>
called a ſtranger: familiarity and ſtrangeneſs are oppoſed
each to other: ſo that then we count the fiery tryal a ſtrange
thing, when we look upon it as a thing unuſual, a thing not
wont to befal the people of God, a rare thing; ſo the phraſe
is uſed, <hi>Luk. 5. 26. We have ſeen ſtrange things to day:</hi> ſuch
as ages have not produced the like.</p>
            <p>2. Things unexpected; ſuch as come upon us at unawares,
which we did not ſo much as dream of; it never entred into
our thoughts to look for, and apprehend any the leaſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
or likelihood of ſuch events. Thoſe things which we
do expect, they are not ſtrange to us when they come, and
that becauſe we were in our expectance familiarized with
them; but when they come ſuddenly, they ſurprize us:
when we expected and promiſed our ſelves to live at eaſe,
and not to be moleſted, and now trouble comes, we are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed:
and thus ſtrangeneſs is oppoſed to expectance, ſo it
is uſed <hi>Ioh. 33. 3. a ſtrange puniſhment to the workers of iniquity,
i. e</hi> ſuch as they were ſecure in their thoughts againſt, and
ſiezed on them unlooked for.</p>
            <p>3. Things whereof we cannot give a reaſon: the cauſe of
them is hidden from our cognizance, and we underſtand not
either whence they come, or what they come for; ſtrange
and admirable are ſometimes uſed ſynonimically, ſo the
word is uſed, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 4. <hi>They think it ſtrange that you run not,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> they wonder at it, and think there is no reaſon for it:
now admiration is a ſuſpenſion of the underſtanding, when
we ſee an effect, and are not able to dive into the cauſe of it:
when we ſee that a thing is, and then ſit down and conſider
either whence, or why it is, and cannot ſatisfie our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it, we then wonder, and place it among the number of
ſtrange things: and ſuch an Opinion had the Pſalmiſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
of the fiery tryal, <hi>Pſal. 73. 16. When I thought this.</hi> i. e.
the reaſon of theſe diſpenſations forementioned, <hi>it was too
painful for me;</hi> his underſtanding was not able to bear the
diſquiſition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100132:6"/>
4. We ſhew that we look at things as ſtrange, when we
carry it to them as unto ſtrangers; and that is in two things
principally;</p>
            <p>1. When we ſuſpect them to come for no good to us, but
rather for miſchief: Jealouſie is a frame or diſpoſition,
wherewith we do frequently entertain ſtrangers: it is very
natural, and therefore uſual for us to think of ſuch, that they
have ſome evil deſign upon us; which jealouſie occaſions us
to keep a critical eye upon them, and warily to watch all their
words and actions, yea their very looks and geſtures; and
let them pretend to never ſo much friendſhip, yet we are hard
of belief, thus <hi>Hanun</hi> ſuſpected <hi>Davids</hi> Servants: thus <hi>Iacob</hi>
looked upon his Afflictions, when he concluded <hi>Theſe things
are againſt me,</hi> Gen. 42. 36. and <hi>Iob</hi> when he uttered that
complaint, <hi>Iob 19. 11. He hath alſo kindled his wrath againſt me,
and he counteth me to him as one of his enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. When they are a burden and weariſomeneſs to us, and
we had rather have their room than their company: and this
is a fruit of the former; for when we expect no good by
them, but ſuſpect ſome deſign of evil upon us from them, it
makes their preſence a burden and grief to us; and this puts
us upon it to deſire, and eagerly long for their departure, and
if they tarry long we are quite tired out with them, and would
uſe any courſe to be rid of them, they are ſuch unwelcome
gueſts to us: thus did <hi>Hezechiah</hi> Iſai. 33. 13. <hi>I reckoned till
morning, that as a Lion he will break all my bones: from day even
to night wilt thou make an end of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. For the ground of the Doctrine: or why it becomes
not the people of God thus to eſteem of the fiery tryal; this
is evident upon a double account: For ſo to think is both in
it ſelf unreaſonable, and alſo prejudicial to the people of
God.</p>
            <p>1. It is a concluſion very unreaſonable; there is no juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to be rèndred for ſuch a thought: if we will ponder eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
circumſtance, we ſhall ſee it evident that it is not a ſtrange
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100132:6"/>
thing in it ſelf, and muſt therefore be irrationally ſo judged
by us; For,</p>
            <p>1. It is no unuſual thing, but very frequent: we have the
Saints of all ages for examples; there is a whole cloud of
witneſſes teſtifying to this truth: ever ſince righteous <hi>Abel</hi>
loſt his life for Chriſt, to this day, there hath been in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
almoſt more or leſs of the fiery tryal upon Gods Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:
it was thus with <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> who were made to
ſerve in hard labour, and in cruel bondage, and are therefore
repreſented as a buſh on fire and not conſumed: yea their
whole paſſage through the Wilderneſs, what was it, but a
going through fire and water. So the Pſalmiſt expreſſeth it,
<hi>Pſal. 66. 12. We went through fire, and through water.</hi> And
beſides the fires kindled upon the Church, particular Saints
have their fires alſo to try them: ſore and ſharp afflictions,
this is <hi>Davids</hi> complaint in reſpect of himſelf, <hi>Pſal. 57. 4. My
ſoul is among lions, and I lie even among them that are ſet on fire.</hi>
Nay God ſpeaks of his Church as a place where he conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
keeps a furnace for their tryal; hence he makes it a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe
upon his name, or one attribute whereby he may be
known by us, <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 31. 9. the Lord, whoſe fire is in Zion, and his
furnace in Jeruſalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It cannot rationally be looked upon as an unexpected
thing. This will appear, (if laying aſide all other grounds
of it) we only conſider that God hath forewarned his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of it, and told them that it ſhall be: for either we muſt
think that he ſpeaks not as he intends, and ſo would deceive
us with vain fears, or elſe that he is ignorant of it, and ſo we
muſt deny his ſupream providence in all theſe events, or elſe
we muſt take his predictions for evidence of the futurity of
it: the Scripture frequently puts us in mind of, and counſels
us to prepare for ſuch times: it declares it not only as a thing
poſſible, which yet ſhould prevent our ſecurity; or probable,
which yet will put a wiſe man upon expectation; but future,
or a thing which muſt be, it was one of the laſt warnings
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100132:7"/>
which our Saviour Chriſt gave to his Diſciples, and with
which he cloſeth up his laſt Sermon to them, juſt before he
was taken from them, <hi>Joh. 16. ult. In this world ye ſhall have
tribulation.</hi> The Apoſtles of Chriſt looked upon it as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
Doctrine to be taught all the people of God, and
were therefore careful to inſtruct them in it in all places
where they came, <hi>Acts 14. 21, 22. That we muſt through much
tribulation enter into the kingdome of God. Paul</hi> aſcerteins
<hi>Timothy,</hi> that it is a Catholick verity, a thing to be expected
by all, as being equally extenſive to a godly life, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12
<hi>Yea and all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi>
So that not to expect it, is an implicite denyal, at
leaſt calling in queſtion of the truth of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>3. Neither is the reaſon of it abſtruſe or difficult, but if we
look into all the cauſes of it, we may diſcern ſufficient ground
for it: For,</p>
            <p>1. If we conſider the principal agent in it, who is God,
(for it is his ſovereign providence, which determineth and
diſpoſeth of all the changes which come over his people)
it follows from his infinite wiſdome, goodneſs, and love to
his Children, ſo far is it from contradicting any of theſe,
(whatever prejudices the carnal reaſonings of our dark un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſtandings may take up) as will appear, if we conſider
the uſe and improvement which he makes of it: our Text
informs us, that it is to try them, in which tryal (like a refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner)
he makes his own people more fit for the uſe and ſervice
of their Lord and Maſter. For,</p>
            <p>1. By it he burns off the dirt that clave to them: Mettal when
it is firſt taken out in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ore from the Mineral, hath much of
heterogeneous matter (dirt and filth) cleaving to it, and that
the fire burns off: ſo do theſe fiery tryals that come upon the
Church, they make it too hot for nominal profeſſors to abide
by it; as cloſe as they ſeemed to cleave to the people of God
in a ſeeming Profeſſion before, now they muſt fall off; the
ſtony ground <hi>is offended when tribulation and perſecution ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,</hi>
Mat. 13. 21. Hypocrites cannot long abide the fiery trial,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100132:7"/>
but when it grows hot upon them, they relinquiſh their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and comply with the World, to avoid trouble.</p>
            <p>2. By this alſo he ſeparates the droſs from the good met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:
when the dirt is removed away the mettal indeed looks
brighter, and makes a fairer ſhew, but yet there is a great deal
of droſs and dregs in it, which render it leſs precious, and
more unſerviceable, but the fire melts that out, ſeparares it,
and leaves the reſt by far more pure: there may poſſibly be
abundantly leſs of it, but that which is, is of a great deal more
value; the people of God themſelves have much of droſs
and corruption cleaving to them; and that eſpecially in
times of outward peace and proſperity, but when God brings
a fiery tryal upon them, it refines and purgeth them: this is
the very deſign of God in theſe diſpenſations, <hi>Iſai. 27. 9. By
this ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and all the fruit is to
take away ſin.</hi> And chap. 1. 25. <hi>I will turn my hand upon thee,
and purely purge away thy droſs, and take away thy tin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Yea, and by this too, he melts down the good mettal:
the fire prepares and fits the mettal by melting to take any
form, to be caſt into any mold which the Founder deſigns:
by ſore afflictions the people of God are made more humble,
and made pliable to any Command of God: they are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſtiffe and inflexible in dayes of proſperity, but now they
ſubject themſelues to the framing hand of God, and are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to receiue his ſtamp and impreſſion, <hi>Zech. 13. 9. I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
them as ſilver,</hi> &amp;c. and what then? why <hi>now they ſhall call
on my name,</hi> and <hi>ſhall ſay the Lord is my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If we conſider the procuring cauſe of it, and that is the ſin
and provocation of his people. Sometimes indeed God ſends
it meerly as probationary, ſo he did to <hi>Job,</hi> but uſually there
is ſomething on our part, putting ſome ſort of neceſſity upon
God to proceed in this way with us: the Church of God
here hath its converſe in an evil World, where, by reaſon
of the remainders of indwelling corruption, apt to take the
infection of many temptations, they are contracting a great
deal of filth and pollution, ſo that their neceſſity
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100132:8"/>
ſeemeth to call for a fiery tryal, to burn off their cords of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
to purge and purifie them from theſe corruptions. They
that are acquainted with their own hearts, and know how
much they have diſhonoured God in dayes of peace, quiet,
and liberty, will eaſily judge and acknowledge that it is not
without very juſt ground, and good reaſon that he often
brings trouble and perſecution upon them. The Prophet
therefore pleads it with the people of God, <hi>Jer. 2. 17. Haſt
thou not procured this unto thy ſelf?</hi> &amp; 4. 18. <hi>Thy way and thy
doings have procured theſe things unto thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. If we look upon thoſe that are the inſtrumental cauſes
of it, which are Satan and wicked men, neither herein will it
appear wonderful; either,</p>
            <p>1. That they are ready and forward to afflict and perſecute
the people of God: he muſt needs be ſtrangely unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their native malice, that thinks it is a ſtrange thing:
it hath been a truth from the beginning, that the World ever
hated the Church: they hated Chriſt firſt, and thence it is no
wonder if they hate his people too: our Saviour Chriſt to
ſhew what entertainment his Diſciples are to expect in the
World, compares his people to Sheep among Wolves, <hi>Mat.</hi>
10. 16 <hi>Behold I ſend you forth as ſheep in the midſt of Wolves.</hi>
And the Wolf ſeeks no other quarrel againſt the ſheep, but
that he is a ſheep, and if he can, will devour him, right or
wrong: to be a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, a ſincere Profeſſor
of the Goſpel, is enough to ſtir up the hate and malice of the
World: <hi>Caius Sejus bonus homo, ſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hriſtianus,</hi> if they can in
no other point charge them, yet this very name renders them
odious: its charge enough if they can charge them in the
matters of their God: and we may as well wonder, why Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
hate men, as why the old Serpents ſeed hate the ſeed of
the Woman. nor,</p>
            <p>2. That God uſeth them as inſtruments, neither is this any
wonder, ſince they are the fitteſt materials to make his rods
of: theſe are rods which will ſmart moſt: their hatred makes
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100132:8"/>
them moſt ready to afflict and chaſtiſe the Church withal: it
is true, if they were principal agents, and left to act their own
pleaſure they were very unfit, for they think only of the ruine
and deſolation, but not of the tryal and reformation of the
People of God; but as inſtruments in the hand of God, they
will make it ſmart, but cannot do any hurt: agen, they are
therein the fitteſt to make rods of, that when God hath done
with them, and chaſtened his People by them, they may be
thrown into the fire: yea in this reſpect God makes eminent
diſcovery of his infinite wiſdome in the choice of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
becauſe in this way he takes an advantage to prove the
reality of his love to his people, then when he is moſt angry
with them. It is therefore worthy our diligent obſervation,
that though God be never ſo angry with his people, and cauſe
his wrath to burn never ſo high againſt them, yet then he ſo
loves them, that he will be avenged on the very Inſtruments
of his diſpleaſure upon them, and therefore makes choice of
his, and his Churches Enemies to puniſh them withal: why
doth God call Babylon to <hi>come down and ſit in the duſt? Iſai.</hi>
57. 1. we have the reaſon rendred in <hi>ver. 6. I was wrath with
my people, and gave them into thy hand, and thou haſt ſhewn
them no mercy.</hi> Though Babylon did no more then what
God both intended and threatned: there cannot be a more
manifeſt token of men hated by God, and appointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
then to be raiſed up to be perſecutors and oppreſſors
of the Church and People of God, whatever their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and provocations may have been.</p>
            <p>4. If we conſider the end of theſe fiery tryals, and that
ariſeth from the improvement which God, who is the prime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in them, makes thereof, and it is to be diſcovered and
obſerved by us in the operation; the ſubſtance of it is, it is
to make his people more humble, more holy, more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the glory of his own great Name, more profitable in
their generation, and better fitted and prepared for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of glory, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſumms up all briefly, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. 16. Where
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100132:9"/>
having given an account of the difficulties, and fiery tryals
which <hi>Iſrael</hi> met with in the Wilderneſs, he certifies them
that the deſign of all theſe was only this, <hi>that he might humble
thee, and that he might prove thee, to do thee good in thy latter
end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. It is prejudicial to the People of God: for them to
place ſuch an account upon the fiery tryal is much to their
diſadvantage: for that,</p>
            <p>1. It tempts us to rob God of that glory which is his due,
and we ought to give him in the fires: God expects to be
glorified by his people, but whiles we look with amazement,
and theſe things aſtoniſh us,, we are more ready to diſhonour
him, by calling his wiſdome, love, goodneſs, truth, &amp;c. into
queſtion, if we count the fiery tryal ſtrange, we ſhall anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
have ſtrange thoughts of God, and hard thoughts of
Religion, ſo he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 13. &amp; 77. 8, 9.</p>
            <p>2. It will wonderfully weaken our Faith in God, our truſt
and reliance on his promiſes, it confounds faith when a ſoul
knows not what to make of things: while <hi>Jonah</hi> is amazed,
he begins to draw up a concluſion of deſperation, <hi>then <hi>I</hi> ſaid
I am caſt out of thy ſight,</hi> Jon. 2. 4. Faith muſt have its evidence,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 1. which is loſt in theſe tranſports.</p>
            <p>3. It will fill the ſoul full of jealouſies and ſtrange ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ready to ſay of every croſs and trouble, this is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
againſt me: he will take all for Enemies, and think God
ſo too, and ſay as he, <hi>thou ſetteſt me for thine enemie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. It will make the tryal by theſe means far more grievous
and hard to bear, it will fret and vex the Soul, raiſe diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etments
and diſcontents; we ſhall behave our ſelves like <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim,
as a bullock unaccuſtomed to the yoke,</hi> Jer. 31. 28. here is
the very reaſon of all the unruly carriages of the people of
God at any time under their afflictions, becauſe they have
not a right apprehenſion and opinion of them.</p>
            <p>5. And from all theſe, we render our ſelves exceeding
uncapable of receiving Counſel, or Comfort: if God ſend
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100132:9"/>
us adviſe, we cannot hear it, if conſolation, we cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it: thus we read, <hi>Exod. 6. 9. Moſes ſpake unto the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael, but they hearkened not unto Moſes, for anguiſh of
ſpirit, and for cruel bondage.</hi> Now all theſe things damnifie
us, &amp; ſo prevent that good which otherwiſe we might derive
to our ſelves from theſe exerciſes, how ſharp ſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> To wave other things, let me apply this truth for the
helping of our faith unto a ſuitable improvement of the
fiery tryal which any of the people of God are at this day
labouring under; and which we our ſelves alſo have weighty
reaſons to live in the continual expectation of; that ſo we
may not ſo think of it, or entertain it as a ſtrange thing: and
to that end that we may have a right judgement, and ſoul ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
apprehenſion of it, let us diligently and prudently
compare the works of Gods providence, with thoſe intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which are given us in his word, and it will afford us a
true and a full diſcovery of the true meaning of theſe things,
and that in both reſpects.</p>
            <p>1. It may ſatisfie us in regard of that ſore perſecution
which is at this day upon divers of the Proteſtant Churches
abroad: we hear of many ſad and ſorrowful calamities
which by the malice of Satan, and rage of men, are brought
upon that cauſe, and are ready to ſit down as men amuſed,
wondering why this is, and wherefore God ſuffers it, how Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt can bear it: let me aſſure you, it is not becauſe God
doth not own and approve of that cauſe; it is his own, he
hath born, and will bear witneſs to it; it is the cauſe which
ſhall ſtand when all other ſhall come tumbling down into
ruine: nor is it becauſe God hath caſt off his people whom
he hath choſen; for his love to his Saints is unchangeable,
inviolable: nor is it becauſe he approves of, or takes delight
in the contrary prevailing intereſt, though they indeed make
their boaſt of their ſucceſſes, and pretend the offering up the
liberties and lives of Gods people, to be a ſacrifice of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:100132:10"/>
therefore; no; Gods curſe is on them and their cauſe,
and in due time their foot ſhall ſlide, It is then none of
theſe; But,</p>
            <p>1. The Scripture tells us of a time wherein Satan is to be
let looſe, in which he will rage extreamly againſt the Church,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 12. and theſe are ſome of thoſe dayes wherein theſe
things are to have their accompliſhment, as relating to the
perſecutions which Antichriſt was to raiſe and continue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Saints of the moſt High. It is true that the rage
and malice of Satan and his Inſtruments are alwayes eagerly
bent to ruine the Church; yet are they tyed up by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
Almighty Power of God, <hi>who ſtilleth the noiſe of the
ſeas, and the tumults of the people;</hi> yet if he pleaſe to give
them leave, and lengthen their chain of reſtraint, as he did in
<hi>Jobs</hi> caſe, they will vent it to the utmoſt of their advantage
and opportunity: it is a certain truth, that Satan and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
have no other ſtint or bounds of their malice then the
limits of divine permiſſion, they ever do as much as they can,
&amp; that they do no more is becauſe God hath an hook in their
noſthrils; now God doth ſometimes, for ends infinitely wiſe,
give them leave to do a great deal, and vent abundance of
their ſpleen againſt his People.</p>
            <p>2. God wills that at ſometimes the truth be ſealed to by
the ſufferings of his own people, as well as owned by their
Profeſſion, that he may make the fulfilling of that truth glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
reſplendent, <hi>Mat. 16. 18. The gates of Hell ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
againſt it.</hi> The truth of the Goſpel is never more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in the World, then by faith and patience of ſuffering
Saints; they then glorifie God, and his name is magnified,
when his honour, and the profeſſion of his name, and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of his truth is more dear and precious to them then
their own lives, and they can readily ſacrifice them, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſe
of it: hereby their faith appears in its vigour, and it is
ſeen how powerful the ſpirit of God in them is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the tryal of
their faith is a moſt precious thing, better then that of gold,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100132:10"/>
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6. 7. and herein the excellency of divine love makes
it ſelf eminent, in that <hi>many waters cannot quench it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It is certain that the Proteſtant Churches abroad in the
World have given God a great deal of provocation, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
enormities and ſcandals that have diſcovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſhamefully amongſt them. If the judgement of thoſe
be right, who conjecture the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> to
whom <hi>John</hi> wrote, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2, &amp; 3. do ſtand for an emblem of
the uarious eſtate of the Church to the Worlds end, they
ſeem now in theſe dayes to be fallen under the laſt and worſt
paettrn, lukewarm <hi>Laodicea:</hi> it is too true and manifeſt, that
there is but a little true zeal ſtirring for the glory of God;
though there be abundance of formality: there is but a very
little of the power of godlineſs to be ſeen, but a great many
wickedneſſes growing and abounding: ſuch prophanation of
Gods holy Sabbaths, that in many places they are diſowned,
and the morality of the fourth Commandment not only cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into diſpute, but wholly renounced; abundance of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,
uncleanneſs, prophaneſs, and many other provoking
ſins, ſuch as an holy God, will not, cannot bear in a people
that are called by his name: they therefore ſtood in need of a
fiery tryal to purge and refine them: they have gathered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of dirt and droſs, and it is not a ſmall fire that will
burn it off, and melt it out: and therefore at ſuch times God
is wont to ſet up his furnace, and provide hot coals for it,
cruel and bloody inſtruments, to execute his juſt diſpleaſure
upon his own people by: thus he threatens <hi>Iſrael</hi> in caſe of
Apoſtaſie, <hi>Deut. 28. 49, 50. The Lord ſhall bring upon thee a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp;c. a nation of fierce countenance, which ſhall not regard
the perſon of the old, and ſhew favour to the young.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. There is a time of reformation expected, and waited for
by the people of God, and it is hoped not to be far off; and
this is the very way in which God hath purpoſed to bring it
about: when the Lord ſpeaks of the happy reformation of
the people of the Jews, he propounds ſuch a method as this
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100132:11"/>
to do it in, <hi>Zech. 13. 8, 9. two parts therein ſhall cut off, and die,
and the third part ſhall be left therein, and I will bring the third
part through the fire,</hi> &amp;c. Gods work of reformation, as it is
a glorious, ſo alſo it is a terrible work, a work which but a
few will be able to endure: it is very probable that two thirds
when they come near the fire, and begin to feel it ſcorch, will
not bear it, but ſeek to avoid it: and thus we hear of many
thouſands in <hi>France</hi> that are daily renouncing the Proteſtant
cauſe, and coming over to Popery, through fear and cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize:
and the other third part they muſt paſs through the
fire that they may be reformed, that when they are tryed, they
may come forth as Gold: and is there any ſtrange thing in
all this? hence therefore, that we may be ſettled and not ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
let us carefully build upon theſe concluſions.</p>
            <p>1. That the fiery tryal is intended only to try the Saints.
it is not brought to deſtroy them, but only to refine and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
them: were believers thoroughly perſwaded of what God
meaneth, by theſe things, they would not be ſo liable to thoſe
frights and amazements which diſtract and diſturb them: our
Text fortifies this concluſion, reſtraining them to this proper
end and purpoſe.</p>
            <p>2. That God overrules all inſtruments: yea, though, as
they are rational agents, and cauſes by counſel of their own
actions, they deſign nothing but miſchief, yet he will uſe
them as meer inſtruments in his hand, not to gain their own
projected ends, but his, which they neither know nor deſign:
they ſhall but do his pleaſure, and not their own, <hi>Iſai. 10 7. Ah
Aſſyrian! the rod of my anger:</hi> what can a rod do without an
hand to manage it? no more can they but as God improves
them: we look too much on men, and think their power is
great, and rage implacable, and now what are we not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to ſuffer? but remember, their wrath ſhall but ſerve to
praiſe God, and the remainder he will reſtrain.</p>
            <p>3. That Gods people, though in the furnace, are yet very
precious to him; yea that he chuſeth them in the furnace:
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100132:11"/>
               <hi>Iſrael</hi> in affliction is often tempted to ſay, <hi>My God hath forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
me;</hi> but God aſſures us that it is far otherwiſe: they are
then as tender to him as the ſucking child is to the pitiful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
you ſee how God thus expoſtulates the caſe with Zion
in this regard, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49, 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>4. That the fiery tryal ſhall not be alwayes, but only for
the appointed time, until it hath wrought out Gods gracious
ends, and then deliverance ſhall come: God will not ſuffer
the rod of the wicked to be alwayes in the lot of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
he knows that if he ſhould, the ſpirit which he hath given
us, would fail and faint; he hath therefore promiſed that <hi>he
will not contend for ever, nor be alwayes wroth,</hi> Iſai. 57 17.</p>
            <p>5. That during all that ſeaſon wherein his people are in
the furnace, he ſits by and tends it. <hi>He ſits as a Refiner,</hi> Mal.
3. 3. ſitting notes a fixed poſture; intimating that God doth
not only come now and then, and occaſionally take notice
how the fire burns, and mettal melts, having mean while o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things to divert and divide his care; but that he makes
it his work and buſineſs to tend it, and therefore tarries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
by it; he throws in every coal with his own hand, and
not one coal more then is meet and uſeful for the work.
He uſeth his skill to make it melt down, and become fit for
his Mold; he humbleth his people, and reforms them by
their tryals, puts a virtue into them, or gives a bleſſing with
them, whereby effectually and powerfully their corrections
become inſtructions to them, and they are made the better
by them: yea they are fitted and prepared to be taken out of
the furnace again, and be veſſels of honour, imployed in the
ſervice of their Lord and Maſter.</p>
            <p>From hence therefore we may be directed both how and
what to pray at this day in the behalf of the Perſecuted
Church of Chriſt abroad in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100132:12"/>
1. How to pray for them, <hi>i. e.</hi> in Faith; when a thing
ſeems ſtrange to us, it ſtirs up unbelief: when men cannot tell
what to make of theſe providences which are in their view,
they know not how to believe; they know not where to fix
their faith: but when a child of God ſees the evidence of
things, he hath now the reaſon of his confidence before him.</p>
            <p>2. What to pray: it will teach us not to over haſten God
in his work, but to leave him to his leiſure, who in infinite
wiſdome knows what he hath to do: when the fiery tryal
looks ſtrange, all we can think of, is the removal and taking
of it away, and we cannot tell how to pray to God for any
thing elſe, becauſe we can ſee no good in the affliction: but
when we are acquainted with the author, nature, and end of
all theſe tryals, it will direct us firſt of all to pray that God
would ſanctifie it for the cleanſing of his Churches; that he
would purifie ſons of <hi>Levi</hi> and reform the Proteſtant Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
in the World: the Church moſt of all needs our
Prayers at this day, on this account; and then we may wait
upon God for their deliverance.</p>
            <p>2. It may adviſe us not to think it a ſtrange or unlikely
thing, that we our ſelves may be brought under the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry tryal,
I am ſure there are many awful ſymptomes of it, and more
from time to time: yea we are likely enough to pull it down
upon our own heads by our fooliſh diviſions, and ſtrange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretions:
and ready enough we are to cenſure and charge
one another in this kind; but there is an higher hand moving
all theſe leſſer wheels: and if we would look aright, the
thing which ſhould moſtly aw and affect us is this, that we
are become degenerate, we have backſlidden and gone aſide
from God, we have loſt our firſt love, we are grown dirty
and droſſie, obſtinate and hard-hearted, and unwilling to be
reclaimed: if therefore God ſhould withdraw from us, and
leave our publick affairs to miſcarry in our hands, I would ſay
it is of the Lord, that he might fulfil the words of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
that told and warned us of dayes of great calamity ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100132:12"/>
becauſe we would not hear them, and return to
our God: and let all ſuch as fear God ponder of theſe things;
look for, and ſee abundant reaſon to expect a winnowing time,
a time of burning, a day of great tryal, that when it comes,
you may not be taken at unawares, or (judging it a ſtrange
thing) be ſurprized with undue terrors and frights; but may
with quietneſs and patience ſubmit to the work of God in
it: ſo ſhall you endure the tryal, and not be burnt up, as
chaffe and droſſe, by it, but be brought out of it again with
joy and glorying, inaſmuch as it ſhall be accounted to you for
