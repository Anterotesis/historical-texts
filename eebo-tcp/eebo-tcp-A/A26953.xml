         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Taken out of Mr. B's Sermon, Preached before the King at Whitehall. Publiſhed thus for the Poor that want Money and Memory.</head>
            <byline>By one Deſirous to promote the common Salvation.</byline>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Hebrews 11. 1.</bibl>
               <q>Faith is the ſubſtance of things hoped for, the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of things not ſeen.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. 1.</hi> WHat means the Apoſtle by theſe words?
<hi>A.</hi> He means, that tho' the glory <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed</hi>
to Believers, and <hi>expected</hi> by them,
be yet <hi>to come,</hi> and only <hi>hoped for;</hi>
and be yet <hi>unſeen,</hi> and only <hi>believed:</hi> yet is the ſound Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
<hi>as truly affected</hi> with it, and <hi>acted</hi> by its attractive
force, as if it were preſent and before his eyes. Or thus;
That the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Vſe</hi> of Faith is to be as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of <hi>Preſence, Poſſeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Sight.</hi> Or, to make the
things that <hi>will be,</hi> as if they <hi>were already</hi> in exiſtence;
and the <hi>unſeen</hi> things which God revealeth, as if our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
eyes beheld them.</p>
            <p>It is true, 1. Faith changes not its <hi>Objects.</hi> 2. Nor gives
it the ſame DEGREE of <hi>Apprehenſion</hi> or <hi>Affection,</hi> as the
ſight of preſent things doth give. No; but,</p>
            <p>1. Things Inviſible are Objects of our Faith.</p>
            <p>2. And Faith is effectual inſtead of ſight of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is ſo unto four Uſes; namely,</hi> 1. The Infallibility of
our Apprehenſions. 2. The Determination of our Wills choice.
3. The Moving of our Affections in the degree neceſſary unto
Holineſs. 4. The Ruling in our Lives, <hi>and bringing us thro'</hi>
Duty <hi>and</hi> Sufferings <hi>for the ſake of the Happineſs believed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. 2.</hi> Do you count Faith an Infallible ſort of Knowledge
then? Why ſo?</p>
            <p>A. <hi>Why,</hi> 1. So ſpeaks the Scripture, <hi>Joh. 6. 69.</hi> And
we believe and are ſure that thou art that Chriſt, the Son of
the living God; <hi>Rom. 8. 28.</hi> And we know that all things
work together for good, to them that love God, to them who are
the called according to his purpoſe; <hi>1 Cor. 15. 58.</hi> Therefore
my beloved Brethren, be ye ſtedfaſt, unmoveable, always
abounding in the work of the Lord, foraſmuch as ye know
that your labour is not in vain in the Lord 2. Believers know,
as ſure as they know there is a God, that God is true, and his
Word true; <hi>Heb. 6. 18.</hi> That by two immutable things, in
which it was impoſſible for God to lie, we might have a ſtrong
conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope
ſet before us; <hi>Titus 1. 2.</hi> In hope of eternal life, which God
that cannot lie, promiſed before the world began. 3. They know
that the Holy Scripture is the Word of God, <hi>by his</hi> Image
<hi>which it beareth, the</hi> Evidencs of Divinity <hi>which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth,
and the</hi> many Miracles <hi>by which it is confirmed.
God, beſides this, gives them to believe,</hi> Phil. 1. 29. For
unto you it is given in the behalf of Chriſt, not only to believe
on him, but alſo to ſuffer for his ſake; <hi>Eph. 2. 8.</hi> For by grace
are ye ſaved, through faith, and that not of your ſelves: it is
the gift of God. 4. And Believers have the Spirit of Chriſt
within them to actuate Faith, and help them againſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<hi>1. Cor. 2. 12.</hi> Now we have received, not the ſpirit of
the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know
the things that are freely given to us of God. 5. Spiritual
Experiences alſo advantage Faith. <hi>They have part of the
Holy Scripture verified in themſelves, and that much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
their Faith of the whole. 6. Likewiſe</hi> very Nature
affords us undeniable Arguments to prove a future Happineſs
and Miſery. <hi>And that doth exceedingly help us in the
Faith of the Supernatural Revelation of it. 7. And</hi> thoſe
that have ſeen the Objects of our Faith, have given us their
Infallible Testimony; <hi>Joh. 1. 18.</hi> No man hath ſeen God at
any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the boſom of the
Father, he hath declared him; <hi>Joh. 3. 11.</hi> Verily, verily I ſay
unto thee, We ſpeak that we do know, and testifie that we have
ſeen; and ye receive not our witneſs; <hi>1 Joh. 1. 1, 2, 3.</hi> That
which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we
have ſeen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our
hands have handled of the word of life: (For the life was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted,
and we have ſeen it, and bear witneſs, and ſhew unto
you that eternal life which was with the Father, and was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
unto us.) That which we have ſeen and heard, declare
we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us; and truly
our fellowſhip is with the Father, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt.
<hi>Add 8.</hi> Satan's rage againſt the Life of Faith diſcovers there
is more than a fancy in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. 3.</hi> But why would not God let us have the SIGHT of
Heaven and Hell; being that would have prevailed for our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
more generally and more certainly?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. 1. Who are you</hi> that dare <hi>diſpute againſt God? Shall
the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made
me thus? 2. It is fit God's Government ſuit the nature of its
ſubject.</hi> Your <hi>Nature</hi> is a reaſonable one. And <hi>Reaſon</hi> is
made to apprehend more than we ſee: and by reaching
beyond <hi>Senſe,</hi> to carry us to ſeek nobler things than <hi>Senſe</hi>
can reach. Should a man underſtand no more than he ſees?
a <hi>wiſe</hi> man and a <hi>fool,</hi> and a <hi>man</hi> and <hi>beaſt</hi> would then be
very like. In <hi>worldly matters,</hi> men can go to much <hi>coſt</hi> and
<hi>pains</hi> for things they <hi>never ſaw;</hi> why not in <hi>ſpiritual mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</hi>
You ſhall believe God's <hi>Promiſes,</hi> if you have ever
the <hi>Benefit</hi> of them; and believe his <hi>Threatnings,</hi> if ever
you eſcape the <hi>Evils</hi> threatned. If the <hi>Reward</hi> and <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
were ſeen, what ſhould difference <hi>wiſe men</hi> and <hi>fools
good</hi> men and <hi>bad?</hi> No man plays the Adulterer in the
face of the Aſſembly. No Thief will ſteal before the Judge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. 4.</hi> Who is it (then) that with you goes for a Believer,
or a Chriſtian?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A. 1.</hi> He is one that <hi>lives as if he ſaw the Lord;</hi> that in
ſome meaſure ſo lives. He does all, as if he ſaw God ſtand
by. All the day he waits on God, <hi>Pſal. 25. 5. Lead me in
thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my ſalvation,
on thee do I wait all the day.</hi> 2. He is one <hi>that liveth on a
Chriſt whom he never ſaw.</hi> Lives on him with Truſt in him,
Adherence to him, Love of him, Joy in him, <hi>1 Pet. 1. 8.
Whom having not ſeen, ye love, in whom though now ye ſee him
not, yet believing, ye rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi>
3. He is one that <hi>judges of men by their inviſible inſides.</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying
the ungodly who pity not themſelves, becauſe they
ſee not what he ſees. And admiring the inward beauty of
the Saints, thro' all their poverty ſeeing God's Image.
Valuing none for ſtature, complexion, cloaths, or learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>&amp;c. Pſal. 15. 4. In whoſe eyes a vile perſon is contemned:
but he honoureth them that fear the Lord: he that ſweareth to
his own hurt, and changeth not.</hi> 4. He is one that <hi>ſeeks a
Happineſs that he never ſaw;</hi> and that with a greater eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
and reſolution than he ſeeks any things that he hath
ſeen. 5. He is one, that, <hi>all his life, prepareth for a day that
is yet to come;</hi> and for the preſence of his Judge. One, that
is asking, O what Life and Actions will be ſweeteſt upon
review when I come to my doom! Not ſo much caring,
what will now beſt pleaſe the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and ingratiate with
<hi>men.</hi> 6. He is one <hi>careful to prevent a threatned miſery that
he never felt; and a place of torment that he never ſaw.</hi>—
Other Faiths are ineffectual Dreams. And (remember)
to dream you are Princes, may conſiſt with Beggery.</p>
            <p>1. O how rare a Jewel is true Faith?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>And</hi> how weak in Faith are the moſt of true Believers?
<hi>[Even as Dying men are weak in Body.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>How plain is the reaſon, that Believers are ſeriouſly holy,
juſt, and charitable?</hi> They are men that do ſee the Lord,
ſee Heaven, ſee Hell. Their Faith ſees them all in the
Glaſs of Divine Revelations.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>How plain is the reaſon, that Vnbelievers are careleſs of
their hearts and ways; and mock at Believers care, and take
them for fools and mad men?</hi> Poor wretches, they do not
ſee the things that Believers ſee. If they ſaw the King of
glory, as Believers do ſee him, they muſt reverence him
as Believers do reverence him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. 5.</hi> Does it not concern every man, then, to make ſure of
this Faith? This, that is given to make things to come as if
they were at hand, and things unſeen as if we ſaw them.</p>
            <p>A. <hi>It doth infinitely concern every man. For,</hi> 1. It is
not ſo common a thing, as moſt do imagine it. 2. Till you have
it, you are no living Members of Chriſt. 3. Till you have it,
you are at enmity with God. 4. Till you have it, you are under
the guilt of all your ſins. <hi>No one of them is forgiven.</hi> 5. Till
you have it, you will be carnally minded: <hi>and thro' the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
end you will have in them, your works that be good
materially, will be corrupt and fleſhly.</hi> 6. Till you have it,
you have no right to Heaven; <hi>Joh. 3. 16, 18, 36.</hi> For God ſo
loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting
life. He that believeth on him is not condemned; but he that
believeth not, is condemned already, becauſe he hath not believed
in the Name of the only begotten Son of God. He that believeth
on the Son, hath everlaſting life: and he that believeth not the
Son, ſhall not ſee life: but the wrath of God abideth on him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. 6.</hi> Well, how ſhall I know whether I have this true Faith
and ſaving, tho' in the leaſt and loweſt degree of it?</p>
            <p>A. <hi>All that have it, tho' in the loweſt degree, will
have theſe</hi> four ſigns <hi>of it within them. 1. A</hi> Practical Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of things unſeen, above all earthly things. 2. An Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
Inclination of heart to embrace unſeen things freely, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully,
and reſolutely; <hi>above and againſt earthly things.</hi>
3. A Bent of Life for God, and for unſeen Bleſſedneſs, as in
Reſolution, ſo in Practice. 4. A Diſpoſition to let go all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
poſſeſſions, when they be inconſiſtent with ſpiritual Hopes
and Happineſs; <hi>Luk. 14. 33.</hi> So likewiſe, whoſoever he be of
you, that forſaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my diſciple.
<hi>Theſe you will have, if Faith be the Eye you do ſee by
for the conduct of your Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q. 7.</hi> If Faith be the Eye by which I do ſee, whereby ſhould
I quicken my ſelf to live by it? Or if it be not, wherewithal ſhould
I ſtir up my ſelf to ſeek Faith and the Life of Faith?</p>
            <p>A. <hi>Put to thy Heart</hi> theſe queſtions, <hi>frequently and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</hi>
Q. 1. <hi>What ſhould I be,</hi> if I ſaw the Lord continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
before me? <hi>And that as verily as I ever ſee a man? If
I ſaw him as</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaw him,</hi> Exod. 34. <hi>Or as</hi> John <hi>ſaw him,
Rev. 1. 13.</hi> And in the midſt of the ſeven Candleſticks, one
like unto the Son of Man, clothed with a garment down to the
foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. <hi>Or as St.</hi>
Paul <hi>ſaw him,</hi> Acts 9. Q. 2. <hi>What ſhould I be</hi> if I had
ſeen the things that God hath done already in time paſt? <hi>If I
had ſeen the</hi> World <hi>drowned and the</hi> Ark <hi>ſaved;</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi>
Gomorrah <hi>burned, and the</hi> righteous Lot <hi>ſaved;</hi> Pharaoh <hi>and</hi>
his Hoſt <hi>ſwallowed up of the red Sea, and the</hi> Iſraelites
<hi>ſaved? And the like memorables of the H. Scripture.</hi>
Q. 3. <hi>What ſhould I be,</hi> if I ſaw the glory of Heaven above?
<hi>If I were rapt up but into the third Heaven, and had ſeen
what St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſaw. If I had ſeen what St.</hi> Stephen <hi>ſaw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Death. If I had ſeen</hi> Lazarus <hi>in</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom?</hi>
Q. 4. <hi>What ſhould I be,</hi> if I ſaw the face of Death,
and were under the power of a mortal ſickneſs, and were given
over by all Phyſicians and Friends? <hi>Or had a Meſſenger from
God to tell me, I muſt die to morrow?</hi> Q. 5. <hi>What ſhould
I be</hi> if I ſaw the great and dreadful day of Judgment as Chriſt
doth deſcribe it? <hi>Mat. 25. If I ſaw that fulfilled which St.</hi>
Paul <hi>ſpeaks, 2 Theſ. 1. 7, 8, 9</hi> And to you who are troubled
reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven,
with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on
them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our
Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of
his power. Q. 6. <hi>What ſhould I be</hi> if I heard Satan accuſing
me for all my ſins unto God, and calling for juſtice againſt me?
Q. 7. <hi>What ſhould I be,</hi> if I had ſeen and did now ſee the
Damned in their miſeries? <hi>If I heard them cry out of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and ſelf-deſtruction of their careleſs lives; And wiſhing</hi>
one were ſent from the dead unto me to warn me that I come not
unto their place of torment? Q. 8. <hi>What ſhould I be,</hi> if in my
Temptations unto ſin, I ſaw the Devil the Tempter, and heard
him hiſſing me on to ſin, to Swear, Curſe, Rail, Lie, Scorn a
holy Life? <hi>O ſhould I then ever chuſe to be ungodly, or be
patient of ſo being? Nay,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Q. 1. <hi>Should I not</hi> ſay in my heart, that the moſt gainful
ſin is worſe than madneſs? Q. 2. <hi>Should I not</hi> plead for the
moſt ſerious Godlineſs? Q. 3. <hi>Should I ever</hi> be offended with
a Miniſter again, for plaineſt Reproof, and cloſeſt Exhortation?
<hi>Or for too much and plain Preaching?</hi> Q. 4. <hi>Should I</hi> not
hear at another rate than ever yet I heard a Sermon? Q. 5.
<hi>Should I not</hi> give over my greedy purſuit of worldly Wealth
and Credit? Q. 6. <hi>Should I ever</hi> be drawn away by Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
again as I have been? Q. 7. <hi>Should I ever</hi> ſtick at ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
when God calls for them from me? Q. 8. <hi>Should I not</hi>
highly value Chriſt, his Spirit, his Grace, his Promiſes, his Word,
his Ordinances? Q. 9. <hi>Should I ever</hi> be quiet under uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of my Reconciliation unto God? Q. 10. <hi>Should I not
then</hi> be all for Peace, Quietneſs and Love, with all that love
the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and are ſeeking inviſible things?</p>
            <p>1. O live not too much on things viſible!</p>
            <p>2. Live upon the things inviſible.</p>
            <p>3. Promote the Life of Faith in others. <hi>Remember,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Worldlineſs is a loathſom Diſeaſe.</hi> To live by Senſe, is
to ſtand on ones head, and to turn ones heels toward
Heaven. 'Tis <hi>unnatural.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Vnſeen things be the only great and neceſſary ones.</p>
            <p>3. Faith is the Souls Wiſdom, Senſuality is very Blindneſs.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Viſible things are tranſitory.</hi> They be things that are
not.</p>
            <p>5. Things viſible, by their changing, give us a diſgraceful
mutability. <hi>Fill us with diſappointments and vexations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Fore-ſeeing Faith is of neceſſity unto your Eternal bleſſed
Life.</p>
            <p>7. Vnſeen things kept duly in your thoughts will ſerve you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
unto theſe things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>They will</hi> repel your Temptations.</p>
            <p>2. Quicken you to your Duties.</p>
            <p>3. Inſtruct you to chooſe your Companies.</p>
            <p>4. Furniſh you with daily Comforts and Satisfaction.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Things Sublunary be <hi>ſomething</hi> or <hi>nothing</hi> as they relate
unto Eternity. We judge of <hi>Means,</hi> as they conduce unto
their <hi>Ends.</hi> I deſire to know no mercy in any other Form
or Name; and to value none upon any other account.
<hi>Idem alicubi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have lived a <hi>ſweet Life</hi> by Gods <hi>Promiſes,</hi> and I
hope, through Grace, can <hi>die by a Promiſe.</hi> They be <hi>Gods
Promiſes</hi> can ſtand by us. Through them <hi>Life is mine, Death
is mine.</hi> God's Covenant is <hi>all my Salvation</hi> and <hi>all my deſire.</hi>
