            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SOME
CONSIDERATIONS
Propounded to the
JEWES,
That they may hear and conſider, and their
Hearts at length may be Turned towards that which
alone is able to Convert Them to God, that they
may once more become his People, and enter into
an Everlaſting Covenant with him that may not be
broken, that ſo they may abide in his Love and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Life, and remain his People for ever.</head>
            <div n="1" type="observation">
               <head>Conſideration I.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>WHat great Love, Mercy and Kindneſs God ſhewed to
that People, above all Nations and Peoples under
Heaven.</hi> Of his own free love he ſet his heart up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, chuſing them to be a People to himſelf.
He brought them out of <hi>Egypt</hi> by a mighty hand and outſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Arm; he mightily preſerved them in, and led them through
the Wilderneſs. He entred into a Covenant with them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
their God, and betrothed them unto himſelf for his own
Lot and Inheritance. He gave them righteous Laws, Judgments,
Statutes and Ordinances, both of Worſhip towards him, and of
an upright Demeanour and Converſation among themſelves and
towards all men. He drove out, the Heathen from before them,
and gave them a pleaſant Land to poſſeſs, even <hi>the glory of all
Lands,</hi> a Land flowing with Milk and Honey. He built an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52308:2"/>
for himſelf among them, firſt a moving Sanctuary or
Tabernacle, afterwards a more ſetled abiding place or Temple
(which <hi>Solomon</hi> built) wherein was the Ark of his preſence,
where he was to be ſought unto and enquired of by them, and
towards which their Prayers were to be directed, and there was
a Mercy-seat, whereof they had large experience, and he ever
and anon ſent Prophets among them, to reprove their errors and
blackſlidings, and to ſet them to rights again. He raiſed up
Judges likewiſe to defend them: and although they were weary
of his Government, deſiring a King after the manner of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſo vehemently, that they even forced a King from him, yet
he took him away from them, and after him choſe <hi>a man after
his own heart, to feed</hi> Jacob <hi>his People and</hi> Iſrael <hi>his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
who fed them according to the integrity of his heart, and
guided them by the skilfulneſs of his hands.</hi> What ſhould I
ſay more? what was wanting of Love, of Care, of Goodneſs, of
Kindneſs, of Mercy, of Gentleneſs, of any thing that a People
could deſire of their God? I ſay, what was wanting of all this
on Gods part? What could he have done more for his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
than he did do? Nay he emptied upon them all the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
all the Mercy, Love, Favour, &amp;c. that that Covenant would
hold to the full, yea and more too: for he bare with them more
than that Covenant required him to bear, and redeemed them
oftner than that Covenant engaged him, <hi>yea many time turned
he his anger away, and did not ſtir up all his wrath,</hi> as he might
often have done according to the tenour of that Covenant. <hi>Yea
in all their afflictions he was afflicted, and the Angel of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
ſaved them:</hi> And he was ſtill ready to ſay in his heart,
<hi>Surely they are my People, Children that will not lie,</hi> at length
they will ſee their error, repent and be true to me: inſomuch
as he was never weary of ſaviug them, of trying them again and
again, of ſtirring up his Bowels of Love and Pitty to Redeem
them, of ſending his Servants and Prophets among them to warn
and reclaim them, even till at laſt it was manifeſt that there was
no remedy but he muſt caſt them off, and provoke them to jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
by a fooliſh Nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (<hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 20, 21.) drawing them
nigh to him, who had been Worſhipping Stocks and Stones, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them become a People, who had long been no People, and
caſting theſe out of his ſight, making them become no People,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:52308:2"/>
who had ſo long been his choſen peculiar People, in Covenant
with him, and nigh unto him above all the Families of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Conſid. II. <hi>What conſtant Rebellion and ſtiffneſs of Spirit
that People all along expreſſed towards the Lord,</hi> what wild ſowre
Grapes they ſtill brought forth to him, ſowre Love, ſowre Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
ſowre Worſhip and Sacrifices, ſuch as the pure pallate of
the Lord could find no reliſh nor ſavour in: but as <hi>Moſes</hi> had
told them, that it was not for their Righteouſneſs God choſe
them to give them the good Land to poſſeſs, for they were a
Rebellious and ſtiff-necked People, <hi>Deut.</hi> 9. 6, 7. So it was not
for their Goodneſs that God continued his love to them, for they
were all along provoking him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 4. When God came to
ſhew that great Mercy to them of Redeeming them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
and bid them caſt away their Idols, they would not caſt away
their Idols, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 7, 8. neither did they regard that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Redemption from the Houſe of Bondage, and from the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
Furnace, but ſaid to <hi>Moſes</hi> it was better for them to ſtay in
<hi>Egypt</hi> and to ſerve the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Exod. 14. 12. Again in the
Wilderneſs, how did they provoke him all that forty years of
Mercy, how did they err in their hearts from his pure fear, and
from Love to him, and from Faith and Confidence in him! how
did they murmur againſt him, and againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi>
their Leaders! how did they forget his Works and his Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
continually! When they came near the Land, and ſhould
have gone in to poſſeſs it, then they would not, but repined and
rebelled becauſe of the talneſs and ſtrength of the Enemy, and
of their Cities: and when they were forbid to go, then they
would go and fight with them. What ſhould I mention the
time of the Judges and of the Kings, how often the Lord made
them ſmart by their Enemies in their own Land, how often he
gave them up to Captivity out of their Land, even till at length
that great Captivity of <hi>Babylon</hi> befel them, and ſince that a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Captivity and Deſolation than that of <hi>Babylon?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Conſid. III. <hi>Whether God, having tryed this People even to
the utmoſt, by that Covenant which he made with them by</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<hi>in</hi> Mount Sinai, <hi>may ever pleaſe to try them ſo any more: Or
if there yet remain any Mercy or Love from God towards them,
whether it is not to be expected another way, and upon another
account?</hi> This is very neceſſary and profitable for them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52308:3"/>
that they may not be looking that way for Mercy and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
from God, in which it is never to come, and ſo have their
eyes and hearts diverted from that way according to which it is
to come: for this muſt needs put them back exceedingly, if their
eyes be looking out one way, and the Love of God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
another channel to run towards them in. This may make
them refuſe the very Mercy, Love and Redemption when it
comes, ſuſpecting it not to be it, becauſe it comes not in the way
and after the manner that they look for it. Now God hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſaid, that when he ſhall be pacified towards them, and ſhall
look again upon them with an eye of Favour to do them good,
it ſhall not be by their Covenant (which could never laſt, but
was ſtill broken on their parts) but by his own everlaſting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
which he would eſtabliſh to them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 60. &amp;c. It
would therefore diligently be enquired by them, <hi>What Covenant
it is which is called their Covenant,</hi> verſ. 61. <hi>And what Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
it is which is called Gods Covenant,</hi> verſ. 62. That they
may withdraw their eyes and hopes from the one, from whence
their Redemption, Recovery and Mercy cannot come, towards
the other from whence it is to come? To which <hi>Query,</hi> for
their ſakes, it is in my heart to return this Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Their Covenant is that which they entred into with
God, the Covenant that their hearts choſe to unite with God by:
and that was to this effect, <hi>That if God would ſhew them his
Will, they would obey it. Go thou near</hi> (ſaid they to <hi>Moſes) and
hear all that the Lord our God ſhall ſay, and ſpeak thou unto us
all that the Lord our God ſhall ſpeak unto thee, and we will hear
it and do it,</hi> Deut. 5. 27. Thus they thought, but the Lord knew
otherwiſe, for <hi>O</hi> ſaith the Lord <hi>that there were ſuch an heart in
them,</hi> &amp;c. verſ. 29. and <hi>Moſes</hi> knew otherwiſe, he knew that
they would <hi>corrupt themſelves, and that evil would befal them
in the latter dayes,</hi> Deut. 31. 29. But Gods Covenant was the
free Covenant he made with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the
Covenant of his Grace, the Covenant of his free Love, whereby
he was able to reach them in <hi>Egypt,</hi> upon the cry of the Seed in
them (in the midſt of their Idolatries, and to bring them out and
do them good notwithſtanding their ſtubbornneſs and ſtiff-neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs)
even before the other Covenant was made. This Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Love was Gods Covenant. This is the Covenant God
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52308:3"/>
remembred to them in the days of their youth, while they were
young and tender, and not yet grown up to be a people under the
other Covenant: and this is the Covenant which laſts for ever,
which is not founded upon their obedience, but on God's free
Love to them for his own Name ſake, and for their Fathers ſake
with whom he freely made it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What doth this Covenant contain?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> putting his Fear in the Heart, writing his Laws in the
Mind, pouring of pure clear Water upon them to waſh away the
pollutions of their inward parts, circumciſing the filth of the Heart,
healing the backſliding Nature by creating of a right Spirit
within, and keeping of the created Spirit right by the preſence
of that Spirit which created it: See <hi>Jer. 31. 31, 32. Ezek.</hi> 36.
25, &amp;c. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 14. 4. This is God's Covenant, this is the new
Covenant, which is to be made with the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and
<hi>Judah</hi> when God redeems them: and they can never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
but by this Covenant, but are to remain deſolate, until
the Spirit be poured out from on high upon them, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 32. 15.
until their Hearts be circumciſed to love the Lord their God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
his fear be placed there, and they thereby cauſed to walk in his
ways. As therefore they receive the Spirit, are brought into the
fear, have the Law written in their minds and become ſubject
thereto, ſo will they taſt of this Covenant, be brought into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
by it, and become a glory inwardly, and outwardly alſo
upon the Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> What is the way for them to have the fear of God put
in their Hearts, to have their Hearts circumciſed, to receive the
Spirit and his Laws into their minds, and ſo to come into this
Covenant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is no other way but that to which <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
directed them, after God had made the other Covenant with
them, and tryed them long by it, together with many Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Signs and Wonders both before and after it; and ſeeing by
all theſe they had not had an Heart to perceive, nor Eyes to ſee,
nor Ears to hear, <hi>Moſes</hi> at length directs them to another Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
the Word whereof would give them Eyes to ſee, and
Ears to hear, and an Heart to underſtand. Which Covenant was
a Covenant beſides the former, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 1. And was indeed the
Covenant concerning Life or Death eternal, <hi>chap.</hi> 30. 15. (the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52308:4"/>
other being but a Covenant of their outward ſtate, made with
them after their coming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> upon their deliverance
there from, and according to their choiſe to become a People to
God according to it.) This Word, <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them, was near
them (nearer then that which was ſpoken by God on the Mount,
and afterwards written in Tables of Stone.) The voyce of this
Word and the Commandment thereof was nearer, that they
need not ſeek any where abroad for it, but only liſten at home
to hear its ſpeech, obey it in the faith, and live for ever, <hi>Deut.</hi>
30. 11, &amp;c. This is the way for them and all Men to come into
this Covenant, and there is no other; There is a Light ſhining
in the Darkneſs of Mans heart, which Springs up in him, and
caſts forth it's rayes to diſcover and draw him out of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
Now as this Light is felt, loved, underſtood in Spirit,
hearkned and cleaved to in the pure Faith, which it begets; that
which cleaves to it, is drawn out of the darkneſs by it, into the
Covenant of the pure eternal Light, where God is, and whither
all they are tranſlated, who are drawn to him in and by this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
as they are kept, preſerved, and continue in the Faith,
Love and Obedience of it. Now I would yet put theſe few
things more to them.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Whether that People of the Jews, as they ſtood related
to God in that Covenant (given by <hi>Moſes</hi> at Mount <hi>Horeb</hi>)
with the Covenant it ſelf and all things appertaining thereto,
were not a ſhadow of ſome inward and Spiritual thing afterwards
to appear and be made manifeſt in its ſeaſon. Whether they
themſelves were not a ſhadow of a more inward and Spiritual
People, to be gathered to God by the inward and Spiritual Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
and whether their outward Covenant was not a ſhadow
or viſible repreſentation of that Covenant, and the Laws of it a
ſhadow or repreſentation of the inward Laws, which were to be
written in the hearts of that Spiritual People? Was not their
Tabernacle, or Temple, a ſhadow of the true Tabernacle or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
ſeeing God dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, but
in a poor, humble, contrite Spirit, and in the Heart that trembles
at his Word, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 57. 15. and <hi>chap.</hi> 66. 1, 2. So was not
their circumciſion a ſhadow of the circumciſion which is to paſs
upon the Hearts of God's choſen? Were not their Sacrifices
types or repreſentations of the Sacrifices of praiſe and of a broken
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52308:4"/>
Heart? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 17. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 14. Was not their <hi>Canaan,</hi>
or Holy-land, a type of the true Holy Spiritual reſt which the faith
gives entrance into? Their City <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a Tipe of the <hi>Jehovah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhammah?</hi>
Their Prieſts and Levites Tipes of the Spiritual Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
which was to offer the pure offering and Spiritual Sacrifices
among the Gentiles? <hi>Malac.</hi> 1. 11. Mark that place, if it did
not plainly foretel the caſting off of the Jews, with the rejecting
of their Offerings, Prieſts and Levites, and God's raiſing up a ſeed
among the Gentiles, where he would have a more acceptable
People and Worſhip, even a pure Spiritual People, and a pure
Spiritual Offering.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If they were Types, Repreſentations, or Shadows of
ſomwhat Spiritual to come, then were they not to give place to
that which is Spiritual when it came, and ſo to be ſwallowed up
in it? Is not the Spiritual Glory, the Glory? the inward Jew, the
Jew indeed? the circumciſion of the Heart, the choice circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?
the offering up of praiſe and of a broken Heart, the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Sacrifice? the Land of Life and Righteouſneſs, the true Land
of reſt to the living by Faith? Is not the Spiritual City, Houſe,
or Temple which God builds, the <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> or Temple of the
new Covenant? Is not this the choice Houſe to God? and is not
this Spiritual Glory to be expected in the days of the Meſſiah, and
all the Tipes and ſhadows of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which pointed at him, to
end in him, when once he comes to ſet up his true, inward, inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſubſtantial Glory among his inward and Spiritual People?
When the day of Meſſiah dawns, ſhall not <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſhadows
fly away? O that your Eyes were opened to behold the inward
Glory of Li<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, the good things of the new Covenant, the great
Treaſure and Riches which are revealed and poſſeſſed in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
by the Spirits that are redeemed unto God, that ye might
partake thereof; and then your Eye would not be ſo much on
that which is outward, which ifye had even to the utmoſt of your
deſires, are not comparable to the inward.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Search the Prophets, ſee if the Meſſiah is not firſt to
come in a deſpiſeable way as a man of ſorrows, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53. 2, 3.
whoſe viſage in that appearance was to be more marred then any
mans, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52. 14. and conſider whether he was not to be cut
off, though not for himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

right Hand of God, until his Enemies be made his Footſtool; <hi>Pſa.</hi>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> Before he come in that Glory wherein <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>. 
So that if he be not thus come already, then that coming of his is
yet to be expected, and his Hands and Feet are yet to be pierced by
you, and then afterwards ye may look upon him whom you have
pierced; <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. and all the Families of <hi>Iſrael</hi> mourn bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
apart for it, <hi>ver.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Moſes</hi> gave the Law, the vail was over his face: your
Fathers were not able to bear the Light wherein the Law was
given, nor the Light wherein the Prophecies of the Prophets were
given, and ſo they ſtill erred from the Law, were offended at the
Prophets while they were alive, &amp; miſ-underſtood their words af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their death. Now do not ye ſearch into <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
in the ſame Spirit of error as your Fathers did, being ſhut
out from the Light of them, even as they were? If it be thus, if the
vail be over your hearts, if ye be ignorant of the true Light, of the
true eternal Power wherein the Scriptures were given forth, ye
muſt needs miſ-underſtand them, miſ-underſtand <hi>Moſes,</hi> miſ-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Prophets, miſ-underſtand the things ſpoken concerning
the Meſſiah, &amp; ſo not be able to ſee unto the end of thoſe things mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred
by <hi>Moſes,</hi> &amp; of that miniſtration which was to paſs away,
nor into the beginning of the miniſtration of the Meſſiah, which
was to ſucceed it. O turn within to the Word nigh in the Heart,
that the true Jew may be begotten and formed in you, and his
Light may ariſe and overſpread you, that in that Light ye may
ſee the Light of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Light of the Prophets, and not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
falſe meanings from their words, but underſtand them a right
in the ſame Holy Spirit, and injoy the bleſſedneſs they ſpake of
and directed to, which lyes in the inward raiſing up of an inward
Seed, and not in an outward conformity of the outward man,
while the heart and mind remains unchanged and unrenewed,
which can never be made new by any miniſtry of the Letter
without the Spirit, but alone by the miniſtry of the Spirit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with or without the Letter, as he pleaſeth.</p>
