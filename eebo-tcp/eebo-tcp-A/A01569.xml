            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE MANNER HOWE to erect the Fornace.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>AKE free-ſtone, or Bricke, and proportion it fower foote ſquare, and three foote high and two foote and halfe in eache ſquare: And at ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corner which is marked with the letter A. leaue an open hole, to let oute the ſmoake, when neede ſhall require: which holes you ſhall cover, with peeces of bricke-bats. And in the midle of the toppe of the Fornace, around hole made, fower inches over as ye ſee it markt with letter B. which hole you muſt alwayes keepe coverd with a turffe or Charcole, &amp; renew it ſo often as the fire doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it away: And note that this hole doth ſerue to giue vent to the ſmoake, and to keepe in the heate: for this hole is right over the mouth of the Pan where the glaſse lieth.</p>
                  <p>This Pan, marked with the letter C. muſt be made of fine clay, fit to indure the fire and placed on an Iron trevet, in the middeſt of the Fornace, ſo that the fire may haue place to giue heat, both vnder and aboue the pan.</p>
                  <p>This Pan wherein the glas is put, muſt haue an open ſquare in the ſide, fiue inches high, and three inches broad, as you ſee marked with the letter D. and the like open place muſt be made in the ſide of the fornace, right oppoſite to the open ſquare in the ſide of the pan, where the peeces of glas do lie, called the proofe peces, which peeces, are to be taken in &amp; oute at your pleaſure, whereby you may knowe when your wrought glaſse is thorowly enameled, and of a faire coullour.</p>

                     <head>How you ought to prepare and put your Glas into the Furnace.</head>
                     <p>TAKE Chalke that is cleane, and beate it ſmall in a Morter, or elſe grind it well on a painters ſtone: then ſprinkle ſome of it in the bottom of the Pan, before the fire be put in the Furnace: then lay a plye, or laine of glaſse that is wrought thereo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſift on more chalk and then laye another tyre, or laine of glaſse: So by beds of chalke &amp; glaſse, you may lay on as much prepared glas as the Pan will hold one rewe aboue another, but reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber that betwene every rewe of glaſse you do ſifte on chalke, that the wrought glaſs may not touch one another. Then take litle peeces of glaſse, and touche the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the ſame coullour that your wrought glaſse is of, &amp; put them in at the paſſag, at the ſide of the Furnace, betwixt the beds of wrought glaſse, &amp; then begin to make a reaſonable fire vnder and aboute the Pan vntill you thinke, that the glaſse hath taken a faire coullour.</p>
                     <p>Now to knowe when your glas is perfectly ready; take a paire of tonges, and drawe oute one of thoſe little peeces of glaſſe, called the prooffe peece, and hold it betwext you and the light: if the cullor ſhowe faire, and ſtick faſt vppon the glaſſe, then you may be ſure that the worke vnder is well and perfectly anneiled, becauſe it hath had the greateſt ſtrength of the fire: But if you doubt that the cullours be not ſure, then rubbe with a rough ſtone or a knife, one of the proofe peeces, and then if the cullor come of, then you muſt let it continew longer in the fire, while you put the next peece to the proofe. Note further that the proofe hole in the ſide of the Furnace, marked with the letter <hi>D.</hi> muſt haue a ſtone that will abide the fire fitted to it, ſuch a one as you ſee marked with the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>F.</hi> which ſtone ſerveth to take of, and put on ſo often as you make triall of the proofe peeces.</p>
                     <p>Alſo yov muſt haue an earthen pot, ſuch as ye ſee marked with the letter <hi>E.</hi> wherein you muſt haue a readines ſome ſoft clay to faſten the ſtone againe, ſo often as you ſhall haue occaſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue it? But the holes in the toppe of the furnace you muſt not ſtoppe with clay, but only with peeces of brick bats ſo that the ſmoake may haue vent oute.</p>
