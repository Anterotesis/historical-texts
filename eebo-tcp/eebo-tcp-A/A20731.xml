            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after I had bestowed some paynes that way, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated by a louing friend that I would not only set downe in writing a couple of my Sermons which especially handle the dutie of prayer; but also pen a Treatise of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian exercise of Fasting. The which I was the more easily persuaded vnto, because it was then alledged, and I knew not the contrarie, That there was very little written of this argument in the English tongue. Howbeit, I do now vnderstand, that not onely before that time, but also since I wrot this Treatise, (which I wholly finished the
<pb facs="tcp:18106:3"/>
last yeare) some others haue taken good paines in this kind. To whose godly labors this booke of mine, though publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed after them, ought not to be preiudiciall, as though I had gathered into this short sum, what they and &amp; others haue written more at large of this argument: for as I had fully finished this Treatise before I saw theirs, so haue I not since taken any thing from them.</p>
            <p>This Treatise of the Christian exercise of Fasting, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the other of Prayer, containing two Sermons on the <hi>15</hi> verse of the <hi>50</hi> Psalme (which were written in the due season, though published thus late, hauing waited at London euer since the last yeare vpon the printing of my Lectures on the <hi>15.</hi> Psalme:) I now dedicat to your Worship, as a small token of my great loue, and a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall remembrance of mine vnfained thankfulnesse: Of my loue, in respect of your manifold vertues, wherewith I was long acquainted whiles we liued together in Christs Colledge, that famous seminarie of good learning and true godlinesse: Of my thankfulnesse, in regard not onely of your former goodwill, but also of your late fauours vouchsafed vnto me since you followed the Court. The Lord blesse you and enrich you with his graces, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease your fauour with God and man, to his glorie, and your owne endlesse comfort. Amen. </p>

The sorts of fasting are to be distinguished according to the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the end, for which it is vndertaken. And it is either naturall, or ciuile, or spirituall, according to the threefold life of a Christian in this world: vnto the helpe and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance whereof,<note place="margin">For it is either naturall,</note> all voluntarie abstinence is referred. The naturall fast is that which is vndertaken for the health of our life naturall: and is sometimes enjoyned by the Phisition.<note place="margin">or ciuile,</note> The ciuile is that which is referred to the wealth of the life ciuile: and is sometimes enjoyned by the magistrat.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.24. or spirituall.</note> The spirituall fast is that, which is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for the furtherance of the life spirituall in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties either of chastitie towards our selues and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or of religion and repentance towards God, and is ordained of the Lord to be vsed to these ends, as necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie shall require. For although fasting in it selfe be but a thing indifferent, and is not simply either commaunded or forbidden: yet as it may bee a meanes either for the preseruation of chastitie, or for the furtherance of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and religion towards God, so farre foorth it is

required and commaunded. For as where the Lor<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Hieronymus.</hi> And that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the moral and chast fast,</note> That fasting is not a vertue in it selfe, but a degree to vertue.

For the greatest enemie to chastitie, and chiefest prouoker of lust, is excesse in meat and drinke: <hi>Ciborum saturitas est seminarium libidinis,</hi> fulnesse of meat is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie of lust: for the ouerplus of our nourishment is the matter of generation, which aboundeth where nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18106:7"/>
exceedeth, and that abounding prouoketh to lust, &amp;c. And therefore the chiefe preseruatiue against lust, is by temperancie in diet not to subminister matter vnto it. And if temperancie suffice not, to vse also fasting, that by withdrawing the oyle as it were from the flame of concupiscence, it may bee quenched. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, let the order and coherence of the Apostles words, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. be obserued:<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Ad Rusticum Monach. de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uendi formae.</hi>

The other thing, that as we vse fasting sometimes, so must wee vse temperance and sobrietie alwayes, auoiding euermore excesse, especially of such things as are apt to prouoke lust. For what are we better for fasting at any time, if we recompence our fasting with fulnesse at other time? for then our minds by much repletion will wax heauie,<note place="margin">

Wherefore in the definition I doubted not to call the religious fast, <hi>An exercise of religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. But here it will be objected,<note place="margin">And yet not ordinarily to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> That if fasting be an exercise of religion; a morall dutie, not onely comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the morall law of God, which bindeth all men, but also commended vnto vs in the Gospell both by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the holy Ghost, and also by the practise of the faithfull in the primitiue Church; then it may seeme, that so oft as we do not fast, we sinne, &amp;c. I answer, that affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue commandements, though they bind vs alwayes, yet do they not bind vs to performe them alwayes and at all times, but as just occasion is offered, together with a concurrencie of all needfull circumstances: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, we are alwayes bound to pray, namely as we haue just occasion to begge any thing at the hands of God, and may do it in some measure as it ought to be done; but we are not bound to pray alwayes and to do nothing else. And although we are alwayes in this life bound to fast; yet are we not bound to fast either alwayes, or so oft as we are bound to pray: for we are to pray ordinarily eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie day, and also extraordinarily as occasion is offered:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18106:11"/>
but we are not to fast ordinarily and euerie day, but vpon speciall and extraordinary occasion. And that we are not bound to joyne fasting with the ordinarie exercise of prayer,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.3.5.</note> it is manifest by the doctrine of the Apostle, 1. <hi>Cor,</hi> 7, where he would haue the husband and the wife (who are ordinarily to pray euerie day) to performe mutuall beneuolence, and not defraud one another, vnlesse it be by consent for a time, that they might giue themselues to fasting and prayer, and again come together, that Sathan tempt them not through their incontinencie. And therefore we are not bound to joyne fasting with our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie and daily prayers, but when we haue just and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall occasion to humble our selues in prayer, after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary maner. And our Sauiour Christ noteth, that those which do fast,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.15.</note> do mourne; and that the time of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting is the time of mourning; and that in the time of joy it is vnseasonable.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Phil</hi> 4.4. 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 5.16.</note> Now ordinarily the faithfull are to be joyfull: and therefore they are not bound ordinarily to fast, and in fasting to mourne, but when they haue some extraordinarie cause of mourning: for as a peece of new cloth put to an old garment maketh the rent worse,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.16.</note> so fasting vnseasonably imposed vpon men, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them not better, but worse. Againe, the time of the fast hath the nature of a Sabbath, wherein we are to lay aside all worldly businesse, and the works of our callings, which ordinarily we are to follow. Neither is it an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Sabbath, but the extraordinarie Sabbath of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; wherein we are after a speciall maner to humble our soules, and to giue our selues to prayer, abstaining not onely from bodily labour and worldly affaires, but also from our food and other delights of this life. And to the sanctifying of this Sabbath we are bound,<note place="margin">

               </note> and also from bodily labours and worldly businesse during the time of the fast, which is a Sabbath of humiliation. Here therefore we are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in respect of the outward exercise, from what we are to abstaine, and for how long.</p>
            <p n="17">17. First, we are to abstaine from food, from whence the whole exercise hath his name. And here we are to vnderstand not an abstinence in part, nor a sober and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemious vse of diet, as I haue shewed before; but a totall abstinence both from meat and drinke, so farre as our health will permit: for this is required to the nature of a fast, as hath bene declared, and further may bee proued by the examples of such fasts as are recorded in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Dauid</hi> when he fasted and mourned for the death of <hi>Abner,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.35.</note> swore that he would not tast bread or ought else till the Sunne were downe. <hi>Ezra,</hi>

                  <hi>Esth.</hi> 4 16.</note> was the totall abstinence from meat and drinke. The Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuits when they proclaimed a fast,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ion.</hi> 3.7.</note> gaue a charge that none should tast any thing, whether it were meat or drinke. And of <hi>Paul</hi> it is sayd <hi>Acts.</hi> 9,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act</hi> 9.9.</note> that for the time of his fasting and prayer, he did neither eat nor drinke. That we should not thinke, either that fasting is an abstinence from meat and not from drinke, or that it standeth onely in choise of meats. And yet this totall abstinence from meat and drinke is not so strictly required, but that they whose health cannot beare it, may for their necessarie su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance take some little refreshing: for the Lord, who desireth mercie rather than sacrifice,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 12.7.</note> doth not so require this outward abstinence, that it should impaire our health, or make vs vnfit for his seruice in the spirituall exercise of the fast; but that it might further vs therein. But here we must take heed, that we vse not this libertie as an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion

to the flesh, pretending we cannot, when indeed we will not abstaine.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="18">18. But now let vs consider,<note place="margin">The reasons why abstine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce from food is required.</note> why this abstinence from food is required, seeing the kingdome of God doth not stand in meat and drinke, nor yet in abstinence therfrom: and that,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.8.</note> as to eat and drinke, so also to abstaine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, is in it selfe a thing indifferent. I answere, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in and for it selfe it is not required; yet as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the inward and spirituall exercise, it is enjoyned. For seeing the bodie is not onely the habitation of the soule, but also it and the members thereof the instruments of the soule, whereby it exerciseth his seuerall functions: who knoweth not, that the actions of the soule are either furthered by the good constitution of the bodie, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the indisposition thereof? and, that the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our bodie doth much depend vpon our diet? For if by intemperancie and excesse wee ouercharge our selues, then are our hearts made heauie, as our Sauiour Christ sayth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34.</note> by surfetting and drunkennesse, and we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vnfit for any good office. Or if we be too carefull to pamper our bodies, they will not be so pliable and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequious to the soule, but rather become like pampered horses, which kick against their rulers. On the other side, if by too much abstinence we pine away our bodies, and denie necessarie sustenance thereto, wee doe make our selues not only vnfit for the seruice of God in the church or commonwealth, and for the discharge of our callings, but also guiltie of selfe-murther: For the difference is not great, whether we murther ourselues at once, or by little and little pine and consume our selues away. And surely, where the Lord forbiddeth to kill, he forbiddeth vs to kill our selues. Now if any in their superstitious conceit shall in this their not sparing of their bodie,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2.23.</note> wherby they make themselues guiltie of murther, place religion or merit; then, as they are injurious to themselues, so also impious against God. That therefore the bodie may bee
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18106:15"/>
seruiceable to the soule, we are to diet it ordinarily, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of sobrietie and temperance: so shall it neither be vnruly to kicke against the soule, nor vnable to serue it. And this disposition of the bodie is the best or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie disposition that may be, for the ordinarie perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of our dutie in the worship and seruice of God. Notwithstanding, if we shall haue necessarie occasion to humble our selues in prayer after an extraordinarie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then is it necessarie also, that to our ordinarie tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and sobrietie, wee should adde the extraordinarie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> exercise of fasting. First therefore, this abstinence from food is required, as a meanes of humiliation: for by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the body, the mind is the better humbled. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as a signe and testimonie of our humiliation: for in our abstinence from all food, we acknowledge our selues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vnworthie of a peece of bread or cup of water. Thirdly, as it causeth the bodily hunger and thirst, so it sharpeneth the spirituall hunger and thirst of the soule: and is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acknowledged by all men to be a notable meanes to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> encrease the feruencie of our prayer. Fourthly, as a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of our repentance,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.11.</note> when we vse it by way of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> reuenge vpon our selues. Fiftly, as an admonition vnto vs, that we abstaining from our food, which is lawfull, should much more abstain from whatsoeuer is vnlawfull. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Lastly, as a meanes of almes giuing, without any more impairing of our wealth than if we had not fasted, when that which is denied to the belly, is giuen to the poore. And thus, and in these respects, we are in the time of the fast to abstaine from food.</p>
            <p n="19">
               <note n="2" place="margin">From sleepe in part.</note>19. Secondly, we are not onely to abstaine from all excesse of sleepe, but also to cut off so much of our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie sleepe, as the want thereof be not an hinderance vnto vs in the worship of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 4.2. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7.</note> that so we may watch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prayer.

also might shew themselues vnworthie of their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie case and rest, and might (as I said) the better watch vnto prayer. When <hi>Dauid</hi> fasted and prayed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of his child,<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.16. <hi>Esth.</hi> 4.3.</note> he lay vpon the ground all night.

            <p n="20">20. Thirdly,<note n="3" place="margin">From orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attire.</note> we are to forbeare our better or more costly apparell: especially if it be such as may hinder our humiliation, or minister some matter to our pride: for such is the vanity of our corrupt nature, &amp; our pronenesse to pride, that although apparell was ordained to couer our nakednesse, and to hide our shame, the consequent of our sinne and falling from God: yet if it bee any thing gay or costly, we take a pride therein. When as therefore the Israelits by worshipping the golden calfe, had bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken their couenant with the Lord,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.1.</note> and had prouoked him to cast them off: the Lord commaunded <hi>Moses</hi> and the people to goe towards the land Canaan, signifying, that he would be as good as his promise made to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in giuing to them the land of promise:<note place="margin">

God before the fruition of the land of promise: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by without Gods fauour, they should haue beene fatted as cattell for the slaughter. And in testimonie of their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, they put not on their better attire,<note place="margin">

Where we see the laying aside of ornaments and costly attire, appointed by the Lord himselfe for a signe and testimonie of humiliation. And to the same purpose, they vsed in those times to put on sackcloth; whereby is meant any course or homely garment. Which ceremonie though it were abused by hypocrites in their priuat fasts to ostentation, that they might bee seene of men: yet in publicke fasts it was profitably obserued for the example of others, whose humiliation might bee the more encreased, by the beholding one of another.</p>

the fast. And all these are to be done, partly as meanes of our humiliation, in remouing the impediments thereof; partly as signes of our humiliation, whereby we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our selues vnworthy of these delights; and partly as tokens of our repentance, in that by way of godly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, because all our sences haue sinned, we depriue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all of their seuerall delights. And as wee are to make all our sences thus to fast: so must wee also weyne our minds from sports and recreations, which would not onely hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our humiliation and godly sorrow, but also distract our minds from better meditations in sanctifying the fast.

            <p n="23">23 But let vs consider also,<note place="margin">Why rest from labours is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</note> why, and in what respects rest is required in the day of our fast, and bodily labours and worldly businesse forbidden. The Lord forbiddeth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18106:17"/>
labour and worldly businesse, and commaundeth rest on euery Sabbath: not because simply he either liketh of rest, or misliketh labour; but because bodily labors &amp; world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly businesse are a meanes to distract vs from the worship of God: and rest from them, is a remedy against distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For euery Sabbath is to be sanctified and set apart from our businesse and affaires, and is to bee consecrated to the worship of God. And further, on the Sabbath of humiliation, we take vpon vs after a more speciall maner to worship God: and therefore that wee may seriously and entirely intend the seruice of God, we are to abando<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all other busines and cares. For that is better done which is done alone, as the Philosopher hath truly said, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Polit.</hi> 4.15.</note> And it is the counsell of the Wiseman, that, what wee doe, wee should do with all our might. For by doing many things our minds are distracted. This therefore doth teach vs, that with free and entire minds, sequestred from all worldly cares, we are to be conuersant in the worship of God; chiefely, when after a more speciall manner we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to humble our selues before him. For if bodily labours and worldly businesse bee therefore forbidden, because they are meanes to distract vs: then may we be sure that distraction it self in the worship of God is much more forbidden. For distraction breeds hypocrisie in Gods worship, and causeth vs when wee draw nigh to the Lord with our lips, to remooue our hearts farre from him.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Againe, the Lord commaundeth vs in all his Sabbaths to rest from labours, that this outward rest might be an admonition vnto vs to rest from sinne. For why (may euery one of vs thinke) doth the Lord forbid me on the day of rest, the lawfull workes of may calling? Or why doe I cease from mine honest affaires? Must I forbeare that which in it selfe is lawfull; and may I doe that which is vnlawfull? Must I therefore for this time
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18106:17"/>
sequester my selfe from my honest businesse, that I may attend vanities or sinnes? Or doth the Lord enjoyne me rest, because hee is delighted with idlenesse, and would haue me to doe nothing? No verily. If he forbid me that which is lawfull, much more doth he forbid that which is vnlawfull. And if he commaund me to rest from honest affaires, it is not because he would haue me idle (for idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is the mother of much iniquitie) but because hee would haue me attend better matters. In a word, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth me to doe mine owne workes and businesse, that I may doe his worke, and attend his religion and seruice. Lastly, there may an outward cause be rendered, why on the day of the fast wee are to cease from bodily labours. For our fraile nature cannot well beare abstinence and bodily labour together: for labour setting the bodie in a heat, wasteth the moisture and spirits, which are to bee supplied by nourishment: otherwise we spend vpon the stocke of our naturall moisture, which is as it were the oyle in the lampe of our life.</p>

Now wee are briefely to consider, for how long this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence is to be obserued. The vsuall time of a fast is the space of a naturall day, <hi>viz.</hi> from euen to euen, or from supper to supper.

But the children of God, when they haue beene pressed with more vrgent occasion, haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times continued this exercise for more dayes together: As <hi>Esther</hi> and the Iewes for three dayes,<note place="margin">

               <note place="margin">Of the fortie dayes fast of <hi>Moses, Elias,</hi> and Christ.</note>26. As for the fortie dayes fast, which <hi>Moses, Elias,</hi> and our Sauiour Christ did fast, it was miraculous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be imitated. Neither did they fast fortie dayes together, either to subdue their flesh, or to humble their soules: But <hi>Moses</hi> being the publisher of the law, <hi>Elias</hi> the restorer of religion, our Sauiour Christ the author of the Gospell; the Lord would by this miraculous fast so countenance their doctrine, as that in respect therof they might seeme not men arising from the earth, or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by men, but the two former as Angels, the third as the sonne of God, sent from heauen: for their abstinence for the time was angelicall. And we might as well take vpon vs to imitate the Angels not taking of food, which they doe not need, as the fast of Christ and of the other two; who were by the power of God aboue the strength of nature so sustained, as that during their fortie dayes, they no more needed food than angels doe. Neither did our Sauiour Christ or either of the other, fast fortie dayes euery yeare, but once onely in all his life. Wherefore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we haue the like cause of fasting, and the like power to support vs (as indeed none haue) it is but a vaine thing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18106:18"/>
to goe about to imitat their fast. Now when the fast is continued for more dayes together, it is not vnmeet, that as in the meane time we are to take but one meale euery day in the euening; so also that we should at those times content our selues with a spare diet in respect of the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, and meane in respect of the qualitie, whether it bee fish, or flesh, or neither; according to the example of <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> But when our fast is once dissolued,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.3.</note> whether it bee at the end of one day, or of more, we may freely vse our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diet, obseruing alwayes the rules of temperance and sobriety. And it fitteth best the faith of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they haue humbled themselues before God, and poured forth their suit into his bosome; to cheere vp themselues in this persuasion, That they hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and committed their cause to God, he will dispose of it and them, as shall be most for his glory, and their good. To this purpose consider the examples, of <hi>Anna,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1, who after she had fasted and poured forth her soule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18. 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.20.</note>

            <p n="27">27 Now for as much as the kingdome of God stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not in meat and drinke,<note place="margin">Of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall exercise, or inward fast, without which the outward is of no value.</note> nor in the abstinence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and seeing bodily exercise profiteth little, but piety (which consisteth in duties of religion sincerely perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) hath the promises both of this life, and of that which is to come:<note place="margin">

For if men rest in the outward fast, as though that in it selfe were acceptable vnto God, they

fast no better than the beasts of Niniuie fasted. They fast not vnto God:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5.</note> imagined, that they pleased God therby: When you fasted and mourned in the fift and seuenth moneth these seuentie yeares, did you in fasting fast to me, to me, sayth the Lord?

And such seemeth to haue beene the fast of the Pharisie:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.11, 12, 14.</note> who for all his fasting twice a weeke, and his other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which hee alledgeth, went home vnjustified. And such is the fast of the Papists at this day, who not onely rest in their outward fast, which notwithstanding in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny respects is but a mockefast: but also ascribe satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and merit thereunto.<note place="margin">The inward fast is a solemn exercise of prayer, ioyned with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="28">28. What then is the spirituall exercise and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fast, whereunto the outward abstinence must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred? It is an humbling of our soules in a solemne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of prayer, joyned with repentance, for the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18106:19"/>
of our speciall suit, holpen forward and testified by the outward fast: as <hi>Ezra</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezr.</hi> 8.21.</note> 
               <hi>chap.</hi> 8. <hi>I proclaimed a fast, that we might humble our selues before our God, and seeke of him a right way, &amp;c.</hi> For as the occasion of our fast is some speciall suit or request, which we are vpon vrgent occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make to God: so the obtaining of our request is the end of our fast. Now that we may obtaine our suit to our comfort, it is necessarie that wee should beg it at the hands of God by prayer. For as <hi>Iames</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.2.</note> You haue not, because you aske not. And because the Lord doth not heare euery prayer of euery man, therefore that our prayer may be heard, it is necessarie, that both it be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified in some measure according to Gods will,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.14.</note> and our selues also indued with repentance for our sinnes. For if our prayer be not rightly qualified, we may aske and not obtaine, as S. <hi>Iames</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.3.</note> You aske and receiue not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you aske amisse. Neither, if wee repent not of our sinnes,<note place="margin">

            <p>But if any shall object that we are to pray and repent continually, and therefore that this exercise is to little purpose: I answere, that howsoeuer prayer is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of vs dayly and ordinarily, and repentance is to be practised of vs continually in the whole course of our liues: yet this hindreth not, but that as the Lord giueth vs extraordinarie occasion, so we may and ought after a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne and extraordinarie manner to humble our selues before him by prayer and repentance,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.21. <hi>Iob.</hi> 42.6.</note> which our Sauior Christ calleth, repenting in sackcloth and ashes, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Iob,</hi> repenting in dust and ashes.</p>
            <p n="29">29. Now whereas I said,<note place="margin">The two parts of repentance concurring with both the parts of prayer</note> that this inward fast is an extraordinarie exercise of prayer joyned with a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of our repentance for the obtaining of our suit: we are to know, that as of prayer, which expresseth our suit, there be two parts, and two especiall properties: so of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18106:20"/>
which secondeth our prayer, there are also two parts. The parts of this prayer are, first, deprecation or praying against some euill which we bewaile, and desire to be remooued, whether it be the euill of sinne alone, or the euill of affliction also caused thereby. Secondly, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for the obtaining of some good, whether it be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the assurance for the remission of our sinnes, and grace to withstand them, or also some other speciall blessing which wee craue. The two especiall properties of our prayer, are feruencie of desire, and assurance of faith. The two parts of repentance are, humiliation in respect of our sinnes past,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

               </note> which is penitencie; and an vnfained purpose of amending our liues for the time to come, both in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking our sinnes, and also in embracing the contrary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (that is, amendment of life) properly.<note place="margin">

                  </gap>, <hi>resipiscentia.</hi>
               </note> Both these parts of repentance must concurre with both the parts of prayer. And both of them affoord their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie helpe to both the properties of prayer. For de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation of pardon, must be joyned not onely with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in respect of our sinnes past, but also with a loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of our sinnes, and an vnfained desire and setled pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to forsake them for the time to come. And prayer for grace and assurance of pardon, must bee joyned not onely with a desire and purpose of amendment, but also with a sence and acknowledgement of our infidelitie and want of grace. And our feruencie in prayer, as it must proceed from the sence of our want: so may it not be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from a desire of obedience and purpose of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And lastly, the promise of hearing our prayer, whereon our faith is grounded, is made both to those that are humbled for their sinnes past, and vnfainedly desire and purpose amendment for the time to come. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, there is a more speciall concurrence of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with deprecation, and of an vnfained purpose of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment with precation: and also a more speciall refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, as of humiliation to the feruencie of our desire, so
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:18106:20"/>
of repentance, which consisteth in eschewing euill and doing good to the assurance of faith. Yea the inward sence and sorrow, and the outward bewayling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing of our sinnes in deprecation, are acts of humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and the desire, the promise, the vow of obedience and amendment of life expressed in our precation, are acts of repentance.<note place="margin">But for distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction sake we are first to speake of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is as it were a preparatiue to praier: second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of the parts and properties of prayer thirdly, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendement of life, which must as it were second ou<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> prayer: Humiliation is partly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which standeth in two things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. An inward sence of our miserie and sorrow for the same: 2. <hi>King.</hi> 22.19. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.37. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.13. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.15.</note> And therefore for plainenesse and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction sake, I will first speake of the former part of our suit, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisting in the deprecation joyned with humiliation: and after of the second part, which standeth in the preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion joyned with amendment of life.</p>
            <p n="30">30. For as touching the former: if wee would bee humble and earnest suiters for the remoouing of euill, whether it be sinne, or punishment, or both; it behooueth vs first to be affected and touched with a sence and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of our miserie, and to be inwardly grieued for our sinnes, that by them we haue offended God, who hath beene so gracious a God, and so mercifull a father vnto vs, and also haue prouoked him to threaten or to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his judgements against vs for the same. This then is the first thing which we are to labour for in this exercise, that in regard of our sinnes, which haue made vs obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Gods judgements, our hearts may melt within vs, and be resolued into a fountaine of teares; that they may be pricked with sorrow and remorse, that they may bee rent with griefe, that they may become contrite and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with godly sorrow. For mourning is so perpetually annexed to fasting, that our Sauiour Christ vseth these words of fasting and mourning indifferently, to signifie the same thing. For being demaunded, why his disciples fasted not; he said, can the children of the mariage cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber mourne, as long as the bridegroome is with them? but the dayes will come when the bridegroome shall bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, and then shall they fast.

In stead of which signes, the thing signified (that is, the inward mourning of the heart) is commended vnto vs, according to the example of <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 69.11. In fasting I wept with my soule: or as others read, I wept in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of my soule. For so the Prophet exhorteth, Rent your hearts and not your garments, and turne vnto the Lord with all your hearts, and with fasting, weeping, and mourning.</p>
            <p n="31">31. And to this godly sorrow must bee added an humble conceit of our selues:<note n="2" place="margin">An humble and vile esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our selues.</note> that as we be grieued with our selues because of our sinne, so also wee should thinke vilely and esteeme basely of our selues, as being worthie not onely of that judgement which is vpon vs, but of all the plagues threatened in the law, and vnworthie of the least of Gods mercies: vnworthie of food, signified by our abstinence therefrom: vnworthie of our garments, which therefore wee lay aside: vnworthie to tread vpon the earth,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.4.</note> which they were wont to signifie by putting earth vpon them. In a word, the outward abstinence is therefore ordained, that by afflicting the bodie, the soule may be humbled. Yea such an vsuall companion of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting is the humiliation of the soule, that not onely the faithfull in the Scripture are said to humble their soule by fasting,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 35.13. <hi>Esay</hi> 58.5. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.27.32. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 21.29.</note> but sometimes also euen the outward fasting is called the humbling of the soule. This inward humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on consisting partly in the godly sorrow, and partly in this base estimation of our selues, is very needfull for vs, if indeed we would be humble suiters vnto the Lord, with
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:18106:21"/>
hope to obtaine:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.17.</note> For, the sacrifices of God are a contrit spirit, and a broken heart, which the Lord in no wise will despise,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.3.</note> For not to sorrow when the Lord smiteth, it is a signe of an hard and incorrigible heart: And secondly, we are to enter into a serious meditation of the haynous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our sins, and of our wretched estate in our selues by reason thereof, which we may conceiue: first, by the deserts of them; and namely by that judgement of God which perhaps is the occasion of this exercise: For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer other causes there may be thereof, the author and inflicting cause is God,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11 32.</note> and the meriting cause is sinne. And not onely that judgement,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39.</note> but also all those plagues both temporall in this life, and eternall in the world to come, which in the word of God are threatned against transgressors. And these threatnings of the law we are both vndoubtedly to beleeue, and also effectually to apply to our selues. Againe, the same appeareth by the sufferings of Christ: For hereby it is most euident, that our sinnes are so heynous and grieuous in the sight of God, that nothing in the whole world could bee found a sufficient ransome to satisfie Gods justice, and appease his wrath for them, or to expiat vs from the guilt thereof, but the precious death of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ the sonne of God. And therefore if God
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18106:22"/>
hath giuen vs the spirit of grace and supplication, we shall lament and mourne as a man weeping for his only sonne, when we looke vpon him whom we haue pierced. And thirdly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10.</note> our sinne will appeare exceedingly sinfull, if we compare and lay together Gods vnspeakable bounties towards vs, and our almost vncredible vnthankfulnesse towards him: For if thou doest truly and vnpartially consider, what thou hast rendred to the Lord for all his benefits which he hath bestowed on thee, and findest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a heape of sinnes, whereby thou hast shewed thy selfe so vngracious towards him, who hath beene so gracious vnto thee, and dishonored him that hath so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured thee: this, if anything in the world, will make thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> heart relent and melt within thee. And to these former considerations let there bee added, when we come to make our request to God who is in heauen full of majestie and glorie, a remembrance of our mold, that we are but dust and ashes; which humbled <hi>Abraham</hi> when he was to intreat the Lord in behalfe of the Sodomits, Behold, saith he,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Ion.</hi> 3.8.</note> yea as the Niniuits speake, we are to cry mightily vnto him. And forasmuch as this fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencie of desire proceedeth from the feeling of our want, and is commonly proportionable thereunto: therefore doth the Lord afflict vs, that in the sence of our want we

might the more earnestly poure foorth our soules before him: and to the same purpose do we afflict our selues by the outward fast, that we might the better giue our selues to prayer: for therefore doe we abstaine from food and delights, that the sence of our want might be increased, and so our feruencie inflamed; therefore do we abstaine from our bodily labors and worldly businesse, that we might the better attend and intend our prayer; and therefore also do we abridge our selues of vnnecessarie sleepe, that we might watch vnto prayer. For this cause some haue called fasting, The wing of praier: because the earnestnes thereof being inflamed by fasting, it doth the more forcibly ascend before the Lord.<note place="margin">

And secondly, although our faith may not relie vpon the merit of our fasting (which indeed is none) but only on the promise of God in Christ; yet being rightly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it affoordeth a good testimonie to our conscience, that the promise belongeth to vs: for although we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in generall, the promises of God to be true; yet we shall haue small comfort by them, vnlesse we can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded that they belong vnto vs. And how can we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18106:26"/>
our selues that they belong vnto vs, if we haue not the condition implied in the promise? As for example: The Lord hath promised to haue respect to the humble, to be neare vnto them when they call vpon him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 66.2. <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.18. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.73.</note> to giue grace vnto them, and to exalt them: Likewise to them that hunger after righteousnesse, and thirst for his grace, he hath promised, that they shall be satisfied. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou wouldest apply these promises to thy selfe, thou must humble thy selfe before God, and not be lifted vp with pride: thou must hunger and thirst after the grace of God and righteousnesse of Christ, and not be full with a conceit of thine owne righteousnesse. But by fasting, our humiliation, as I haue shewed, may be furthered, and our spirituall hunger increased, and so our selues better qualified, according to the condition included in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: which condition if we find in our selues, then may we from the promise as it were the proposition, applied to our selues by the testimonie of our conscience, as it were the assumption, gather to our selues a comfortable conclusion. Of which comfort they bereaue themselues, who performe this exercise in an opinion of meriting thereby: for when fasting is joyned with a conceit of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, it doth not so much humble the bodie, as puffe vp the soule, and so make it vncapable of the grace of God: for the Lord giueth grace to the humble, and he resisteth the proud.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5.</note> And as the blessed virgin saith, He filleth the hungrie with good things,<note place="margin">

Another notable meanes to confirme our faith in the assurance of obtaining our sute, is to forsake our sins (which make a separation betweene God and vs) and to promise amendment for the time to come, which also is testified by our fast: For it is not sufficient to confesse our sinnes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 59.2.</note> if we would find mercie with God; but also we must forsake them.<note place="margin">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18106:26"/>
blessing which doth affect vs: then it behooueth vs to forsake our sinne, which is the cause of the affliction, and also an obstacle, and as it were a partition wall betwixt God and vs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.8.</note> to keepe his blessings from vs. Wouldest thou then haue thine affliction remooued? remooue the cause, which is thy sinne. And if thou wouldest haue God to repent him of the euill of affliction,<note place="margin">

Now if we shall truly repent of our sinnes, and vnsainedly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose amendment of life for the time to come, then may we persuade our selues that our preseruation and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance shall be joyned with Gods glorie; &amp; consequently may be emboldned with better assura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of faith, to desire the Lord to preserue &amp; deliuer vs euen for his own glory, &amp; for his names sake. But here, as we desire any sound co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, so must we deale soundly with the Lord: and not as the common practise of the most, in the time of affliction, to promise greatmatters vnto the Lord, which they haue no true purpose to performe: for this is to flie vnto God, and to go about to deceiue him with our lippes.<note place="margin">

And likewise <hi>Cyrill,</hi> Wilt thou haue mee shew thee what
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18106:27"/>
manner of fast thou must obserue? fast from all sinne, take no food of mallice, receiue no dainties of pleasure, inflame not thy selfe with the wine of lust, fast from bad practises, abstaine from euill speeches, containe thy selfe from wicked thoughts: such a fast pleaseth God. But these testimonies of men were of little weight, if the Lord himselfe did not auouch the same truth.

And therefore the Niniuits, when they proclaimed a fast, gaue in charge, that euery one should turne from his euill way and from that violence (for that was the crying sinne of the Niniuits) which was in their hand.

The publicke fast is that,<note place="margin">The publicke fast <hi>Ier.</hi> 36.9.</note> which being vpon publicke cause, by publicke authoritie proclaimed <hi>before the Lord,</hi> is both publickly and priuatly to be sanctified of all as a Sabbath of humiliation vnto the Lord. In which definition there are foure things to bee obserued: first, who are to appoint the publicke fast; secondly, vpon what cause; thirdly, who are to obserue it; fourthly, how. As touching the first:<note n="1" place="margin">VVho are to appoint it.</note> The appointment of publicke fasts appertaineth to those who haue publicke authoritie to call the people together to the publicke worship of God, and to cause them to cease from their bodily labors and worldly affairs: as appeareth in the examples of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke fasts recorded in the word of God: as 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.3. <hi>Ion.</hi> 3.7. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Ezr.</hi> 8.21. <hi>Ioel</hi> 1.14. And this they are to doe by proclaiming of the fast, that is, both by giuing publicke notice of it, and also by charging all men to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble themselues at the time appointed, to obserue it; according to the direction of the holy ghost by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ioel:</hi>

in vprightnesse of heart, as before the Lord: and also that those who are to obserue it, assemble themselues as before the Lord, to sanctifie a fast vnto him.</p>
            <p n="50">
               <note n="2" place="margin">Vpon what occasion.</note>50. The next thing to be considered, is the cause whereupon the fast is to be proclaimed: that when there is just cause, those which are in authority may take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their dutie in this behalfe. And that is (as I haue generally noted before) when we haue some important and vrgent occasion to become humble and earnest su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnto the Lord,<note place="margin">As first, for the obtaining of some publick blessing.</note> either for the obtaining of some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and publicke blessing, or for the remoouing of some publicke euill: and this either for our selues, or for other churches of Christ.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2.</note> As for example, when some publike matter of great importance is to be attempted, then, as we haue extraordinarie occasion to craue the blessing of God vpon vs, so also we haue just cause to fast. Consider to this purpose the examples of <hi>Ezra,</hi> chap. 8. and of the faithfull in the primitiue Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 13. and 14. both which being to craue the blessing of God; the former vpon their voyage towards Ierusalem after their capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie; the latter vpon the ministerie of his seruants whom they either ordained or sent forth to the worke of their ministerie, commended their sute vnto the Lord by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke fasting and prayer. Which examples may be a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient direction for appointing publicke fasts, vpon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions of no lesse importance.<note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 21.9.12.</note> In the hystorie of the Kings it appeareth to haue beene the custome of the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelits (though that practise was monstrously abused by <hi>Iezabell</hi>) that publicke matters of importance should bee enterprised with a fast.</p>

As touching publicke euils, they be either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke sinnes, or publicke judgements of God for sinne. For if the people of God haue committed some common or publicke sinne, and thereby haue prouoked the Lord to wrath and indignation (as indeed when we sinne, he is angry) then it behoueth them to judge themselues, if they
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18106:30"/>
would not bee judged of the Lord, and by humbling themselues before the Lord in fasting and prayer, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease his anger, and to preuent his judgements. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Israel, when many of them had sinned by idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and by reason of their sinne stood in feare of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listims: the Prophet <hi>Samuell</hi> assembleth them together to Mizpeh,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.6.</note> where they solemnized a fast, and pouring forth water before the Lord, acknowledged and beway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their sinne.

And for the better humbling of our selues in prayer, and testifying of our repentance, it is very needfull, that as in all other publick calamities, so in this of the pestilence, we vndertake this exercise of fasting. Onely this we are to be admonished
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18106:31"/>
of, That in places of infection, the vtter abstinence from food is not so precisely to be vrged, but that the people may, yea ought to take something before they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, as a preseruatiue against infection.</p>
            <p n="53">53. Lastly, for the time of captiuitie,<note place="margin">Captiuitie. <hi>Zac.</hi> 7.5, <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.19 <hi>Ier.</hi> 52.4.</note> we haue the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Iewes, who during their captiuitie in Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, obserued foure fasts in the yeare: the first in the tenth moneth, because on the tenth day of that moneth <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar</hi> with his armies began to besiege Ierusalem: the second, in the fourth moneth, because on the ninth day of that moneth, king <hi>Zedekiah</hi> and the men of warre flying out of the citie of Ierusalem,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ier.</hi> 52.7, 8.</note> were taken by the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: the third, in the fift moneth, because on the tenth day of that moneth the temple was ouerthrown,<note place="margin">

These fasts they took vpon them to obserue during their captiuitie, that therein they calling to mind the former judgements of God, as it were in foure degrees for their sinnes, they might the better be humbled to implore the mercie of God for the time to come. But when as these fasts by long custome grew ordinarie, and many of the Iewes obserued them for custome rather than consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (insomuch that they thought this custome was to be obserued after their deliuerance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> captiuitie, the cause of their mourning and consequently of their fasting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, and accordingly mooued that question, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7:) the Lord, as he reprooueth their former hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, in resting in the outward fast without repentance; so he promiseth them for the time to come, that if they would truly repent, and walke in the obedience of his wayes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.19.</note> their daies of fasting and mourning should be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into daies of feasting and joy.</p>
            <p n="54">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:18106:32"/>54. From whence we are to obserue, that if we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the examples of the faithfull in the scriptures, shall in the time of our distresse turne vnto the Lord with all our hearts, and with fasting and prayer humble our selues before him, the Lord will take away the cause of our mourning, and turne our fasts into feasts. The which I speake not as though this exercise had been altogether neglected among vs: For to Gods glorie, and to the stopping of our aduersaries mouths, the Papists (who know not what the true exercise of fasting meaneth) it is to be acknowledged, that howsoeuer we haue not beene so frequent in this exercise as were to be wished, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding vpon diuerse publick occasions, there haue beene publick fasts obserued and solemnized among vs, with good and happie successe. As for example, in the time of the great plague, <hi>Anno</hi> 1563: after the great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, <hi>Anno</hi> 1579: after intelligence had of the Spanish inuasion, <hi>Anno</hi> 1588: in the time of the famine, <hi>Anno</hi> 1596, and 1597: and now of late in this time of the pestilence, <hi>Anno</hi> 1603. Besides the priuat and secret fasting of the faithfull, as it hath pleased God to mooue them either by priuat or publicke occasions.</p>
            <p n="55">
               <note n="3" place="margin">VVho are to obserue the publicke fast.</note>55. The third thing to be obserued, are the persons: who, when a publicke fast is proclaimed, are to obserue it. The Prophet <hi>Ioel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.16.</note> besides those of yeares appointeth, that the children, euen those that sucke the breasts, should be assembled to the fast. And the Niniuits proclamation for obseruing the fast,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ion.</hi> 3.5.7.</note> was extended not onely to all men, women and children, but also to their cattell. The reason whereof was twofold: first, that the pitifull sight and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable crie of the children and cattell might encrease their sorrow: and secondly, that they might be brought to a deeper sight, and more serious acknowledgement of the heinousnesse of their sinne, which had pulled vpon them such an vniuersall judgement of God, as should not onely afflict themselues, but also extend to the very
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18106:32"/>
infants, yea and to the bruit beasts. But this practise is to bee reckoned among the ceremonies which in those times were vsed to augment their sorrow and increase the sence of their sinne, and is no more to be imitated of vs than their sitting in the ashes, the renting of their cloths, their girding of themselues with sackcloth, their putting of earth vpon their heads, and such like: among vs, the Lord requireth no more to obserue the outward fast, than such as by reason of their vnderstanding and discretion, may the better be fitted thereby to humble themselues before him in this solemne exercise of prayer and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: For the outward fast obserued (as it is ordinarily among the Papists) without any exercise of religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring therewith, is nothing worth. But to all those that are come to yeares of discretion, and are exempted by some present necessitie, is the equitie of that law to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, <hi>Leui.</hi> 23.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Leuit.</hi> 23.29.</note> Euerie person that humbleth not himselfe on the Sabbath of humiliation, shall euen be cut off from his people.</p>
            <p n="56">56. There remaineth the fourth and last thing,<note n="4" place="margin">How the publicke fast is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</note> 
               <hi>viz.</hi> how the publicke fast is to be obserued. And this also I signified in the definition, when I sayd, it is to be sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied both publickly and priuatly, as a Sabbath of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation. Where three things are to bee noted: for first, when as I say it is to be obserued as a Sabbath (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath bene proued) we are to vnderstand that therein a double rest is required:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> 1. as a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath or day of rest.</note> the one outward, from bodily labours and worldly businesse; the other inward, from sinne. And contrariwise, that the profanation of this Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is condemned, whether it be by neglecting the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward rest, and imploying the time in bodily labours and worldly affaires; or else by abusing our rest, either to idlenesse, or to vanitie, or to sinne: To idlenesse, when men resting in the outward rest, imagining that nothing else is required at their hands, do nothing, and by doing nothing they do euill; as appeareth by the disjunction in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18106:33"/>
in that question of our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 6,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.9.</note> Is it lawfull on the Sabbath dayes to do good, or to do euill? Whereby our Sauiour plainly signifieth, that if we do not good on the Sabbath day, we do euill. To vanitie, when as men giue themselues to sports and pastimes: for if that be vnlawfull on the ordinarie Sabbath, much more is it vnseasonable on the Sabbath of humiliation. Lastly, to sinne, for if the workes of our lawfull callings be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on the Sabbath, much more the workes of darknes: whereunto whosoeuer addicteth himselfe on the day of the fast, he celebrateth a Sabbath to Sathan, and not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord.<note n="2" place="margin">As a Sabbath of humiliation</note> Againe, whereas I said it is to be obserued as a Sabbath of humiliation, we learne, that we are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to abstaine not onely from labours, as on the ordinarie Sabbath; but also from food, from exercise of sleepe, from brauerie in apparell, and from all worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="57">
               <note n="3" place="margin">To be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified both publickly</note>57. Thirdly, whereas I add that it is to bee <hi>sanctified</hi> both publickly and priuatly as a Sabbath of humiliation: I signifie, that not onely rest is required, but also an holy rest; and not onely the outward fast, but much more the spiritual exercise of prayer and repentance. And that this sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the day of the fast (which standeth in vsing the meanes of sanctification) is partly publicke, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly priuat. The publick, is in the assembly: for this, as eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie other Sabbath,<note place="margin">

The dutie therefore of the ministers is, to stirre vp themselues in a more than ordinarie measure of zeale to discharge their ministerie, both in preaching the word of God, and also in prayer. In preaching, that it may bee through the blessing of God a powerfull meanes to worke in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple those things which in this spirituall exercise are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, <hi>viz.</hi> humiliation, prayer with feruencie and faith, and repentance.

            <p n="58">58. The dutie of the people is,<note place="margin">By the people</note> first, to bee present at publick assembly: for if we will sanctifie a Sabbath vnto the Lord,<note place="margin">

For those who liuing single and haue the gist of continencie, as also those who may lawfully vse in mariage the remedie which God hath ordained against lust, to them daily sobrietie and temperance in
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:18106:35"/>
diet is needfull, but often fasting euerie weeke is hurtfull and pernicious: to such, an ordinarie fast imposed for keeping their bodies chast, is like a new peece of cloth set vpon an old garment, which impaireth the garment, and maketh the rent much worse.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 9.16.</note> And it is against rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that because their Abbie-lubbers and pampered clergie (who hauing vowed to liue single, though they be neuer so incontinent, and liuing in such idlenesse and and belly-cheere ordinarily, as that no true fasting at times would suffice to keepe them chast,) had need to fast oftener than the Pharisey, who fasted twice a weeke: that therefore others, which liue painefully in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and chastly either in single life or mariage, should be bound to the like obseruation of fasts; many of them needing rather kitchen-phisicke and cordials to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them, than fastings and vacuations to keepe them downe.</p>
            <p n="62">62. But indeed their fasting is but one of their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall pretences of their not intended chastitie: for as if flesh and whit-meats were the onely prouokers of lust, they forbid all vse thereof in the time of their fast, but permit a fulnesse of all other food: whereas not onely some other kinds of food in respect of the qualitie, but also any other kind almost in a greater quantity, is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemie to chastitie than the moderat vse of flesh or whit-meats.

            <p n="63">63. But come we to their irreligious fast, which they doubt not to call a worship of God. Howbeit first, it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> meerely externall, neither is it joyned with any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie exercise of prayer or repentance among them: and therefore is of no value in the sight of God. And secondly, although it be nothing but an outward exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> yet there is not all in it which is required in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fast: For in their fast is not required abstinence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from other delights, or yet from labours and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18106:36"/>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> worldly businesse, but onely from food. And thirdly, not from all food but only from flesh, egs and whit-meat. as though it were a more holy thing to eat fish than flesh, oyle than butter, broths, jellies, leaches, marmalade, sucket, and such like, than egs, milke, butter and cheese, And if in their fasting, mourning were required, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the doctrine and examples of the holy Scripture, the vse of wine and strong drinks which is permitted among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">

They confesse indeed, that fasting is an abstinence from all food vntill the euening: yea <hi>Bellarmine</hi> teacheth, that it is not sufficient to a fast, that a man eat but one meele in the day, vnlesse his meele be so late, as that it may be called a supper,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>De bonès operib, in particular. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>ca.</hi> 2.</note> and not a dinner: and withall professeth, that it is a thing neuer heard of, that any fast should bee dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before the ninth houre, which is three a clocke after noone: For they say, in Lent they may not eat before eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and at other times not before three a clock. But the receiued custome of the Church of Rome, which <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> with flat contradiction to those former assertions doth defend, is to take their meele either at noone or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: besides some bread and drinke in the morning, and their drinking or collation in the euening. And because by their canons they may not in Lent go to supper before their euening seruice be ended: they do therfore dispatch their euening prayer in the morning, that they may be at supper by noone. But indeed both in Lent and other times, their suppers which should be in the euening at the end of the fast, are turned into dinners. And therefore whatsoeuer they pretend to the contrarie, their fast stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth wholly in choise of meats, and abstinence from flesh and whit-meats. <hi>Durandus</hi> saith, because the Pope &amp; Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, and Prelats, and other religious men when they
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18106:36"/>
fast, do eat at the sixt houre, that is, at noone; therfore cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome doth wholly excuse all others.</p>
            <p n="64">64. Againe, their fasts are statarie, and obserued at set times. Wherefore as they are seldome or neuer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken vpon any speciall occasion, so are they for the most part vnseasonable, and consequently hurtfull, euen as new wine in old vessels:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 5.37.</note> and yet imposed vpon all, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the penaltie and guilt of mortall sinne. If any man object that the same times are obserued among vs: I answer, that it is not a fast which is obserued among vs at those set times, but an abstinence only from flesh in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile respect, <hi>viz.</hi> that fish and other meats might bee vsed and spent as well as flesh: and that flesh being spared and forborne at such times, might be the more plentifull, and consequently the more cheape. And further, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> superstitious,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> 2.16.21.23. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1.3.4.</note> standing in the prohibition of meat for religion sake, which is a doctrine of diuels. And so far are they gone in this superstition, as that in their times of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, they seeme to place the top of holinesse in absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from meats forbidden, and the height of iniquitie in eating flesh: for, to eat one mor<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ell of flesh in Lent is a greater sinne and more sharply punished among them, than not onely drunkennesse or gluttonie in other meats, but also than whordome or idolatrie, to say no more. Lastly, whereas their fast being a more externall fast, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> yet but a mock-fast in respect of a true outward fast; is notwithstanding by them obtruded vpon the Lord, not onely as his solemne worship, but also as a worke satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie for their sinnes, and meritorious of eternall life: it it is sacrilegious, blasphemous, abhominable, and in a word, Antichristian.

But foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the greatest part of the Israelits did rest in the performance of the externall and ceremoniall worship, as though that in it selfe were acceptable to God: the Lord therefore reasoneth with his people concerning his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, from the 7. verse to the 16, teaching and enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming them, That howsoeuer he had ordained lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning sacrifices, which now were more precisely to be kept; yet that he neither required nor esteemed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall

            <p>Here therefore first the godly are taught patiently and chearfully to beare their crosse,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.8.</note> because <hi>no strange thing</hi> happeneth to them, but that which is common <hi>to all the faithfull.</hi> Yea the sufferings of the godly, are the sufferings of the body of Christ,<note place="margin">

For such is the communion of Saintes, that when the godly are affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, with them both Christ himselfe and the church also which is his body, doth suffer. Secondly, those which are not afflicted, are taught, not to be hasty (as many are) in censuring and judging those who are in affliction, as

though they were wicked men or hypocrits. Which was a foule ouersight in the three friends of <hi>Iob:</hi> who conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But in respect of their good also the Lord correcteth his owne children sometimes, when he seemeth to spare the wicked, least

For as <hi>Peter</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>The time is, that iudgement hath begun at the house of God. But if it begin with vs, what shall be the end of those who obey not the Gospell of God? And if the righteous scarcely be preserued, where shall the vngodly and the sinner appeare? Behold</hi> (sayth <hi>Salomon</hi>) <hi>the righteous shall be recompenced,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Wee haue heard that it is the lot of the righteous to be afflicted in this world, let vs now see what is their dutie when they are afflicted: for that is the second thing which is here to be considered, namely, to pray that God would deliuer them, or else arme them with patience. <hi>Call vpon me</hi> (sayth he) <hi>in the day of trouble.</hi>

            <p>But here some bodie will object (who seemeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe wiser than his fellowes) that our times are set and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God in his immutable decree, which we may not hope to alter or change by our prayers. I answere, that <hi>Daniel,</hi> although he knew by the prophecie of <hi>Ieremie</hi> that seuentie yeares were appointed to the captiuitie of the Iewes in Babylon;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2,</note> yet notwithstanding he thought it his dutie in the end of those yeares to call vpon God for the deliuerance of his people: for hee well knew, which we must also acknowledge, that as the Lord appointeth the end, so also he appointeth the meanes, among which the principall is prayer.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 38.1.5.</note> On the other side, <hi>Ezechias,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hee heard by the Prophet the sentence of the Lord, That he should die and not liue; notwithstanding, by prayer obtained the prolonging of his life. For as
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18106:40"/>
God had decreed to adde to his life fifteene yeares, so he decreed prayer to be the meanes whereby that addition should be obtained. And so the Niniuits, though the Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> had told them, and they beleeued him, that their citie within fortie dayes should be destroyed;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ion.</hi> 3.4, 5.</note> yet by humbling themselues before God by fasting and prayer, and repenting from their euill wayes, they escaped that common destruction. And hereunto may bee added the examples of the faithfull in all ages, who hauing called vpon God in their trouble, haue beene deliuered out of their distresse. Adde also the testimonie of <hi>Iames,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.16.</note> that the <hi>prayer of a righteous man auaileth much with God:</hi> and also the commandements of God, and his gracious promises, both in this place and elsewhere in the Scripture. And let vs know that it is damnable curiositie, vnder a pretence of submitting our selues vnto the secret will of God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell against his will reuealed: For as <hi>Moses</hi> sayth, <hi>The secret things belong to the Lord our God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.29.</note> 
               <hi>but the reuealed things vnto vs and to our children for euer, that we may doe all the words of this law.</hi> But by this reason a man might as well refuse his food, because the day of his death is appointed and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be altered by him, which euery man knoweth to bee both wicked and foolish. Let vs therefore know, that whatsoeuer the secret will of God is concerning vs, that his reuealed will is, that in this time of affliction we should according to the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.</note> pray vnto him: and let vs assure our selues of this, That if God in his secret counsell hath decreed to deliuer vs for our good, he hath also decreed that our deliuerance shall bee begged and obtained by prayer.</p>
            <p>Yea, but sayth another, afflictions must be borne pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently and meekely, and therfore wee may not pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
            <p>I answere, that these things may well stand together: for we must patiently beare afflictions, and yet pray a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. Indeed we may not pray against them abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18106:40"/>
but in our prayers we are willingly to submit our selues to the good will and pleasure of God, and resigne our selues into his hands, following therein the example of our Sauiour Christ:<note place="margin">

            <p>Now if it bee our dutie in affliction to flie vnto the Lord by prayer, it may not be denied, but that we are to pray in a sence of our want; and consequently, that wee are to be humbled vnder the mightie hand of God, and that we are to mourne vnder the crosse, because by our sinnes wee haue offended God our gracious and louing father, and prouoked him to lay his rod of correction vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs. It becommeth not Christians when they are affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, to be like Stoicks or stockes, without sence and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: for it is a signe of an hard heart not to mourn when God afflicteth, <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.<note place="margin">

               <hi>In that day</hi> (the day of publicke trouble and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamitie) <hi>did the Lord God of hosts call vnto weeping and mourning, and to baldnesse and girding with sackeloth: and behold, ioy and gladnesse, slaying oxen, and killing sheepe, eating flesh, and drinking wine, eating and drinking, for to morrow we shall die.</hi> But what followeth?<note place="margin">

Againe, if we are to pray in affliction, we must pray with feruencie and with faith: for the sence of our want must not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may vs or discourage vs from calling vpon God, but must serue as a spurre to pricke vs forward, and to stirre vs vp to pray with feruencie of spirit,<note place="margin">

            <p>And as wee are to pray with feruencie, so also with

faith, being assured, that the Lord doth not onely accept of vs and our prayers in the name &amp; mediation of Christ, but also that our request shall be graunted to vs, so farre forth as is expedient for Gods glorie and our good. For as <hi>Iames</hi> sayth,<note place="margin">

               <hi>If any man want wisdome</hi> (namely, how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane himselfe in affliction) <hi>let him aske of God, who giueth to all men liberally and reprocheth no man, and it shall be giuen him.

And therefore wee must not thinke, that euery delay is a finall repulse; but by the delay of the benefit which we aske, our desire of obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it should be encreased.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:18106:43"/>
vs, and he will bind vs vp.</hi> Thirdly, he onely that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs to call vpon him, he onely hath promised to helpe vs, he onely is able to heare our prayers and to graunt our requests.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 65.2.</note> Therefore <hi>thou which hearest the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, vnto thee shall all flesh come.</hi> Fourthly, when as we flie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord in time of trouble, we glorifie him, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him to be infinitely good, and therefore willing; omnipotent and all-sufficient, and therefore able to helpe and deliuer those which call vpon him. And for this cause the Lord in this place preferreth the sacrifice of prayer before all the sacrifices of the law.</p>
            <p>Wherefore grieuously do they offend, who when the hand of God is vpon them, doe not call vpon him: for they are not onely injurious to themselues, but to the Lord also, whom they rob of that honour which is due vnto him.

            <p n="4">4. The fourth and last thing to be considered, is, the time when we are to pray vnto God.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1. 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.17.</note> We are to pray <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,</hi> and <hi>without ceasing</hi>; but especially, as here we are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, in the <hi>day of trouble</hi>: and that for these reasons. First because our prayers then are most necessarie: for then we feele, and feeling doe confesse, that Gods helpe is so

For euen as water whiles it runneth at large hath a still motion, but being gathered into straits, runneth with violence: so it fareth with many men, who being at large in ease and prosperitie, either pray not all, or very coldly; but being brought into straits, they poure forth their soules before the Lord like to a streame of water, as the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> speaketh.

               <hi>humble and effectuall prayer, when thy chastening was vpon them.</hi> Thirdly, because the Lord doth therefore afflict vs, that we should flie vnto him, therefore doth he bereaue vs of other helpes and meanes, that wee might the more firmely relie vpon him. For if wee were not afflicted, it may be we should not seeke to him, or if wee had other meanes, we would relie vpon them. This is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by the Lord himselfe in the prophesie of <hi>Hosea: For I will be</hi> (sayth he) <hi>vnto Ephraim as a Lion,</hi>

               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:18106:44"/>
(being taken captiue and bound in chaines and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Babylon) <hi>he prayed to the Lord his God, and humbled himselfe greatly before the God of his fathers, and prayed vnto him, &amp;c.</hi> The prodigall sonne, though he had runne a leaud course, yet when he was pinched with penurie, then hee did bethinke himselfe of returning home to his father, and falling downe before him, said, <hi>Father, I haue sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst heauen,</hi>

               <hi>and before thee, &amp;c.</hi> And this is that which some doe well gather out of this text, that God doth therefore afflict vs, that we may call vpon him, that calling vpon him we may be deliuered, that being deliuered we may glorifie him. Fourthly, because the Lord many times doth therefore delay his helpe and deferre our deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that our desire may be inflamed, and our faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised, as appeareth by the parables of the two friends, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.5.8. and of the widdow and the judge, and the scope thereof, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Matt.</hi> 15.22, 23, 28.</note> for when she had cried after him to haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie on her because her daughter was miserably vexed with a diuell, and our Sauiour aunswered not a word, she notwithstanding persisted in calling vpon him, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that his disciples came vnto him and besought him saying, <hi>Send her away, for she crieth after vs:</hi> And although he answered, that <hi>he was not sent but to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel,</hi> notwithstanding shee importuneth him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and comming vnto him, worshipped him, saying, <hi>Lord helpe me:</hi> And hauing receiued another repulse, our Sauiour answering that <hi>it was not meet to take the childrens bread, and to cast it to whelpes:</hi> she acknowledged her selfe to be such a one, but yet expected such crums as it were
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:18106:44"/>
from his table. Whereupon our Sauiour Christ hauing tried her sufficiently, commendeth her faith, and graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her request. And lastly, because the Lord in this place hath not onely commaunded vs to call vpon him in the time of affliction, but also hath promised to deliuer vs. And therefore in obedience to this commandement, and in faith in this promise, wee are to poure foorth our soules before the Lord in the day of affliction.</p>
            <p>But some man will aske, When is this day of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein we are to call vpon God? Affliction is euery thing that crosseth our lawfull desires: and that is either priuat, or publicke: priuat, either belonging to our selues, or to others: to our selues, either in our soules, as the anguish of the soule for sinne, which is the greatest affliction, or other heauinesse and passions melancholike: or in our bodies, as sicknesse, infirmitie, hurts, or wounds: or in our goods, as pouertie, want, losses, debts: or in our good name, as infamie by euill reports or slaunders: or in those that belong vnto vs, as wife, children, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. To others, as to our kinred, friends, acquaintance, neighbours, countreymen, brethren in Christ, as all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are to be esteemed of vs, though forrainers in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of place, and in respect of affection, not well min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to vs: for such a sympathie there ought to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those that are members of the same bodie politick, but much more of the same mysticall bodie of Christ: especially when other respects also concurre of kinred, amitie, acquaintance, neighbourhood, &amp;c. that in a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low feeling and Christian compassion, we should mourn when other members of the same bodie are afflicted. When the affliction therefore belongeth to our selues, we are in our owne behalfes to call vpon God: when to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we are in tender compassion of their griefe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their cause to God in our prayers. <hi>Dauid</hi> when those who indeed were his enemies, were afflicted, he humbled
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18106:45"/>
himselfe in fasting and prayer for them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 35.13.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 35.13. 1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 10.12.</note> In like sort he mourned and fasted for the death of <hi>Saule</hi> and <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. and also of <hi>Abner,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.35.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Publicke affliction is, when the countrey, the Church or Commonwealth is afflicted with any common cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie; as famine, sword, pestilence, desolation, captiuitie, and such like.</p>
            <p>Let vs therefore consider, whether this present time be a time of affliction, or not: and if it be, let vs know that this commaundement belongeth vnto vs, and that the Lord <hi>calleth</hi> vs to fasting and prayer.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 22.12.</note> Be it that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of thy selfe and those that belong to thee thou hast no cause of mourning (as who almost is free?) yet thy brethren, thy sisters, thy friends, thy countreymen, thy fellow members in the bodie of Christ are visited by the hand of God, or the places of their dwelling at least in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with this contagious sickenesse. Did <hi>Dauid</hi> fast and mourne and pray for his enemies when they were in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and doest not thou mourne for thy deare bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and friends? But though we had no priuat cause of griefe, yet the common calamitie should most of all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vs: seeing the chiefe cities and many other places of the land (the Lord shooting his arrowes on euery side) are visited with the fearefull plague of pestilence. What? shall we thinke because we as yet through the goodnesse of God haue escaped this plague, that therefore it is not a time of affliction, wherein wee are to humble our selues before God by fasting and prayer? Farre be it from vs, that we should be so hard-hearted, as that we should not take to heart <hi>the affliction of Ioseph:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amos</hi> 6.6.</note> or such vnnaturall mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the bodie politicke, or vnsound and rotten mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the mysticall bodie of Christ, as that when the chiefe citie, and as it were the head of our countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides many other places and persons, is so grieuously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, that we should not condole and mourne together
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18106:45"/>
with them, and pray to God for them? Or may we think, that because our selues, and perhaps also the places where we dwell are free, that therefore this affliction and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth not concerne vs? yes beloued, it doth neerely concerne vs. For that this affliction is laid vpon the land for sinne, we need not doubt, seeing the Scripture so oft doth teach that truth.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 107.11.17.34. <hi>Esay</hi> 64.5. <hi>Psal.</hi> 39.11. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.39.</note> 
               <hi>Behold</hi> (sayth the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi>) <hi>thou art angrie when we offend. Dauid</hi> testifieth, that the Lord with <hi>rebukes doth chastise men for sinne:</hi> and <hi>Ieremie, That men are punished for their sinnes:</hi> insomuch, that afflictions and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments in the Scripture are often called <hi>iniquities and sinnes.</hi> But for whose sinnes I beseech you is this publicke judgement laid vpon the land? For their sinnes alone, who haue beene visited, or are dead of the plague? No I assure you; but for the sinnes of vs all. For although God hauing mercie on vs, doth for our sinnes among the rest afflict others and spare vs, that wee beholding this common judgement in others, deserued by our sinnes as well as theirs, might <hi>meet him in his iudgements,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amos</hi> 4.12.</note> and turne vnto him by repentance; yet may not wee thinke our selues more righteous than they, or esteeme them as more grieuous sinners than our selues, because the Lord hath hetherto spared vs, vnlesse we would haue that sentence of our Sauiour Christ to bee most justly applied vnto vs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.5.</note> 
               <hi>I tell you nay, but vnlesse you repent, you all shall likewise perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore let vs humble our selues vnder the hand of God, let vs turne vnto him that smiteth vs; that of vs, that at the least may be verified which is said of the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelits, when the Lord <hi>slew them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 9.13. <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.34. <hi>Ioel.</hi> 2.12.</note> 
               <hi>they sought him, and turned</hi> vnto him. Let vs I say <hi>turne vnto him with all our hearts, and with fasting and mourning:</hi> let vs call vpon God with vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right hearts in this time of our trouble, that being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of the same, we may glorifie him. <hi>Who knoweth if he will returne, and repent of this euill</hi>; nay, who knoweth
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18106:46"/>
not, or who doubteth but he will haue mercie on vs and deliuer vs (if our deliuerance may bee for his glorie and our spiritual good) seeing he hath so graciously promised in this place, that if we call vpon him in the day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he will deliuer vs, and we shall glorifie him.</p>
            <p>Hauing spoken of the commaundement, we are now to intreat of the promise, which is added as a reason or motiue to stirre vs vp to the obedience of the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. For as the commaundement teacheth vs, that if we desire deliuerance out of affliction that we may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, we are to begge the same at the hands of God by heartie prayer: so the promise assureth vs that if wee call vpon God in the day of trouble, hee will deliuer vs for his owne glorie and our comfort: for so he saith, <hi>I will deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words two things are promised, deliuerance, and the end or fruit thereof, which is the glorifying of God.</p>
            <p>As touching the former, we are to consider the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of the person promising, and the thing it selfe which is promised. The person is God: for as it is he that afflicteth, so it is hee onely which deliuereth, as the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> sheweth:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.1.</note> this therefore teacheth vs vnto whom we are both in affliction to flie for deliuerance (not to Saints in heauen, nor to wisards on earth, but to God alone;) and when wee are deliuered, to returne thankes. And secondly, we may here obserue the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable clemencie of our gracious God, who is so readie (as this promise importeth) to aunswere to our prayers, and to graunt our requests: yea, in that he allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs to call vpon him by his gracious promise, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he is more readie to heare, than we to pray. So the Lord himselfe testifieth by his Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> 65.24,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 65.24.</note> 
               <hi>Yea before the call, I will aunswere, and while they speake I will beare</hi>: and the same is signified in the parable of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall

And this, as it is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge of Gods people to haue God neere vnto them in all things which they aske at his hands,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut</hi> 4.7.</note> as <hi>Moses</hi> saith: so also this is the <hi>assurance</hi> of the faithfull,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.14.</note> that <hi>if we aske any thing according to his will, he heareth vs. And if we know that he heareth vs whatsoeuer we aske, we know that we haue the petitions that we haue desired of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The thing promised, is deliuerance: for so he saith, <hi>I will deliuer thee.</hi> And the same is promised elsewhere: for that which our Sauiour Christ hath taught vs to aske, the Lord hath promised to graunt: But Christ our Sauiour hath taught vs to pray that we may be deliuered from the euill of affliction, therefore the Lord hath promised deliuerance therefrom.

               <hi>He that turneth away his eare from hearing the law, euen his prayers shall be abhominable</hi>: for as in prayer we speake to the Lord, so in the preaching of the word the Lord spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto vs. And good reason it is, that the Lord should not heare vs, if we will not heare him. <hi>Therefore it is come to passe,</hi> saith the Prophet <hi>Zacharie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.13.</note> 
               <hi>That as he cried and they would not heare, so they cried and I would not heare saith the Lord of hosts.</hi> Or if we be close sinners and hypocrits, making faire shewes openly, and yet be addicted to secret sinnes: for as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66. <hi>If I regard wickednesse in mine heart, the Lord will not heare me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore (beloued) as it is certaine that our sinnes are the cause of our affliction: so we must be carefull to auoid our sinnes, if we desire that our affliction may be remoued: for they are as a wall of separation betwixt God and vs.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ezech.</hi> 43.8.</note> If therefore thou wilt not ceasse to sinne, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will God ceasse to afflict thee; vnlesse perhaps hee will giue thee ouer as one that is incurable, as Phisitians sometimes giue ouer their patients, when they thinke them past cure.</p>
            <p>And to conclude this point: if when thou callest vpon
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18106:49"/>
God in the time of trouble, the Lord doth not deliuer thee, examine they selfe whether thou doest not continue in sinne without repentance: and if thou doest, breake off thy sinne by repentance, and turne vnto the Lord, and he will heare thee: for so he saith by the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> after hee had protested that hee would not heare their prayers whiles they continued in their sinnes;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 1.15, 16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>Wash you, make you cleane, take away the euill of your workes before mine eyes, ceasse to do euill, learne to do well, seeke iudgement, releeue the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, iudge the fatherlesse,</hi>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 18.</note> 
               <hi>defend the widdow: Come now, and let vs reason together saith the Lord: though your sinnes were as crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, they shall be made white as snow, though they were red like scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let they shall be as wooll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second limitation, is in respect of the prayer it selfe: For we haue no assurance that God will heare eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie prayer, but onely such as is made according to his will reuealed in his word, as <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, this is our assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <hi>that if we aske any thing according to his will,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.14.</note> 
               <hi>he heareth vs.</hi> We must therefore be carefull that our prayer be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the word of God, both in respect of the maner and forme how we pray, and also in regard of the end: as touching the manner, there are three things which are especially required. First, that we pray in truth: for it maybe that when thou callest vpon God, thou prayest in hypocrisie and not from thine heart, either because thou prayest with wandring thoughts, or with fained lippes. With wandring thoughts: when as thy tongue vttering a prayer, thy heart goeth a wandring or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring after the vanities of this world, or is otherwise di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted with other vnseasonable thoughts: For if when thou commest neere to the Lord with thy lippes, thou remouest thy heart from God, thou maist justly feare left in steed of the blessings which thou seemest to aske, thou pull down the judgements of God vpon thee,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Esay</hi> 29.13, 14.</note> according to the threatning of the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18106:49"/>
29. For if thou shouldest joyne into one speech, the thoughts of thy mind, and the words of thy mouth (both which the Lord doth vnderstand a like,) thou wouldest be ashamed to deliuer such a speech to a mortall man, which thou art not ashamed to vtter vnto the immortall God. Or how canst thou looke that God should heare or regard thy prayer, when thou doest not heare nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard thy selfe?</p>
            <p>With fained lippes thou prayest,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 17.1.</note> when the desire of the heart doth not agree with the prayer of thy lippes; when thou askest with thy mouth, that which thou doest not desire with thine heart: or when thou pretendest that in thy prayer, which thou doest not intend, or promisest that, which thou doest not meane to performe: this is no better than lying vnto God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Hos.</hi> 7.13, 14.</note> when men <hi>cry vnto God, but not from their harts,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Hosea</hi> speaketh: for what doth a man but lie, when hee speaketh otherwise than he thinketh? This is a common fault of men when they are in affliction, to promise and pretend great matters; when notwithstanding their heart is not vpright with God, and therefore the more carefully to be auoided of vs, lest we seeme with the vnsound Israelits when the hand of God was vpon them,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 78.36, 37.</note> to go about to <hi>deceiue the Lord with our mouth, and with our tongue to speake lies vnto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true indeed that God hath promised to heare the prayers of them that call vpon him: but this promise is to bee vnderstood with restraint to them that call vpon him in truth. As <hi>Dauid</hi> most plainely teacheth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 145, <hi>The Lord is neare to all that call vpon him</hi>:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 149.18.</note> what to all? <hi>yea to all that call vpon him in truth:</hi> For that payer which is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, is not onely the moouing of the lippes, or the speech of the tongue, or the lifting vp of the eyes or hands,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 25.1. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.41.</note> but it is the lifting vp of our soules, as <hi>Dauid</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth his prayer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25, <hi>A lifting vp of our hearts with our hands vnto God in the heauens,</hi> as <hi>Ieremie</hi> exhorteth vs to pray:
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18106:50"/>
it is the <hi>pouring forth of our soule</hi> before the Lord, as <hi>Anna</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth her prayer, 1. <hi>Sa.</hi> 1,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15.</note> and as <hi>Dauid</hi> willeth vs to pray, <hi>Ps.</hi> 62.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 62.8.</note> The second thing required in respect of the maner, is, that we pray with feruencie of spirit. It may be when thou callest vpon God, thou prayest for fashion rather then for feeling, and so vtterest a cold or luke-warme prayer like to thy selfe;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.15.</note> which thou mayst justly feare, is no more acceptable vnto God, than luke-warme water to the stomacke.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iam.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 35.17.</note> It is true, that <hi>the prayer of the righteous man auaileth much,</hi> but with this addition, <hi>if it be feruent.</hi> This is that prayer which pierceth the clouds, and is effectuall with God. If therefore we would obtaine our sute, let vs craue the assistance of Gods spirit, by whose helpe and direction we may pray <hi>with sighes that cannot be expressed,</hi> let vs learne to <hi>poure forth our soules like a streame of water,</hi>

            <p>The third thing required in the manner is, that wee pray with faith. It may bee when thou prayest thou art in doubt whether thou shalt be heard, and therefore mayst not looke to obtaine thy sute: For it is the <hi>prayer of faith,</hi> to which the promise is made:<note place="margin">

            <p>Againe, our prayer must be conformable to the will of God, in respect of the end. It may be thou askest riches, to spend the same vpon thy lust: or thou askest deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of thine affliction, that thou mightest follow the pleasures, or haue opportunitie or leisure to follow thine accustomed sinne, &amp;c. But we may so aske, and yet notwithstanding the promise, we may misse our desire: for as <hi>Iames</hi> saith, <hi>you aske and receiue not</hi>: how so, seeing Christ hath said,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iam.</hi> 4.3.</note> aske and you shall receiue? <hi>Because you aske amisse</hi>: and wherein did they aske amisse? in respect of the end; <hi>that you might consume it on your lusts.</hi> But we must remember that in this promise the Lord hath joyned these two together, <hi>I will deliuer thee, and thou shalt glorifie me.</hi> And therefore if we aske deliuerance, we must aske it to this end, that we may glorifie God. Wherefore as it is good for the stirring vp of our feruencie and spirituall hunger, with our prayer to joyne fasting: so also it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for the confirmation of our faith, and setling our
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18106:51"/>
resolution in glorifying God, to joyne with our prayers godly vowes of some things whereby God may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>The third limitation is in respect of the thing which is asked: for if the cause why thou art not heard and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, is not to be imputed either to thy person, being one that doth beleeue and repent; or yet to thy prayer, being framed in some measure according to Gods will, both in respect of the manner and the end; then art thou to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured and vndoubtedly resolued, that the thing which thou askest, is either not good for thee at all, or else not yet. And that God doth alwayes heare his children pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto him effectually, though not <hi>ad voluntatem,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their desire, yet <hi>ad vtilitatem,</hi> according to their profit.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Thou askest deliuerance out of affliction, and God hath promised to deliuer his chileren that call vpon him; but it may be, it is not a good thing that thou shouldest be deliuered: and therefore in that case, deliuerance is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther included within the compasse of Gods promise, nor yet intended in thy prayer, if it be conceiued aright: For a promise, vnlesse it be of some good thing, it is a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning rather than a promise: we must therefore remember that God hath promised <hi>to giue good things to them that aske him.</hi>

                  <hi>Math.</hi> 7.11.</note> And that prayer which is conceiued aright for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall benefits (such as deliuerance out of affliction is) must not bee made absolutly, but with the condition of Gods glorie and our euerlasting good. Whereas thou therefore askest deliuerance out of trouble that thou mightest be restored to thy former estate, it may bee that it is better for thee to be taken out of this world, that thou mayest change thy mortall life for an immortall, and that

a finall end may be put both to thy trouble,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14, 13.</note> and to thy sinne, which is the cause of thy trouble. It may be, if thou shouldest liue longer, thou wouldest be infected with the common corruptions of the time,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wisd.</hi> 4.11.</note> and therefore as it is said of <hi>Enoch,</hi> Thou art taken away, least wickednesse should alter thine vnderstanding, or deceit beguile thy mind.

               <hi>wee are chastised of the Lord, that wee should not be condemned with the world.</hi> Or, if thou shouldest bee continued longer in this life, it may bee that such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamities as the Lord is intended to bring vpon the land, should happen in thy time; and therefore God in great mercie taketh thee away, as hee did the godly king <hi>Iosias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 22.20.</note> that thou shouldest not see the euill which is to come: as it is said of <hi>Esay</hi> 57.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Or else it is good for thee, that the affliction which thou desirest to bee remooued from thee, should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued vpon thee: thine estate and disposition being such, that it is very needfull for thee to bee trained vp in the schoole of affliction, and to be dayly exercised vnder the crosse.

            <p>Or at the least, it is not good for thee as yet to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, because the Lord hath not as yet attained to that end for which hee doth afflict thee.

themselues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in regard of those profitable and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fruits which the holy ghost by their afflictions wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in them: then assuredly, it is not good for thee, that thine affliction should cease before it hath wrought such good effects in thee, as the Lord by it intendeth to worke: vnlesse thou wouldest giue the Lord occasion to complaine, that thou art one of those whom he afflicteth in vaine.<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Now the Lord afflicteth his seruants, either for their triall, or for their chastisement. The Lord trieth them by afflictions, either that his graces may appeare in them to his glorie and the good example of others, or that their weakenesse may be manifested, for their owne amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and instruction of others. If hee trie men for the manifestation of his graces in them, it is expedient that they should bee tried by a triall proportionable to the measure of their graces, either in respect of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or of the continuance,<note place="margin">

            <p>And hence it is that the best men haue endured the greatest trials, as appeareth in <hi>Abraham, Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Iob,</hi>

And let patience</hi> (sayth he) <hi>haue her perfit worke, that you may be perfit and entire, lacking nothing.</hi> If the Lord doe trie vs to discouer and bewray our weakenesse, that so hee may abate our pride, and humble vs before him; it is sometimes expedient that the afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should be prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, though to our griefe for the present,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.16.</note> yet to our good in the end. Because many men are able to endure the first brunt, and therein greatly please themselues, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding in the continuance of the affliction, doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably bewray their weakenesse. But because this kind of triall is also a chastisement, let vs consider those fruits

and effects which the Lord by chastisements doth worke in his children.</p>
            <list>

               <item>6. That he might exercise and strengthen our faith and patience.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Well then, call thy selfe to an account, thou which thinkest it so long till thou bee deliuered. First, art thou not yet humbled vnder the mightie hand of God, but continuest still as proud and as vaine as in former times? assure thy selfe it is good for thee that thine affliction should be continued, that thou mayest learne humilitie and the knowledge of thy selfe, and mayest be brought to a more serious consideration of thy sinnes and of thy wretched estate in thy selfe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Doest thou not flie vnto the Lord by prayer, or if thou prayest, doest thou pray but coldly, and as it were for fashion sake? therefore the Lord delayeth to helpe and deliuer thee, that thou mayest learne to call vpon him seriously and feruently.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hast thou not yet repented thee of thy sinne,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18106:53"/>
whereby thou diddest prouoke the Lords anger against thee? Hast thou not yet turned to him that smiteth thee? Therefore doth he continue thine affliction as thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuest thine impenitencie:<note place="margin">

            <p n="4">4. Hast thou not yet learned obedience by that which thou doest suffer? Therfore doth he still continue thine affliction, to teach thee obedience, and to make thee partaker of his holinesse:<note place="margin">

            <p n="5">5. Art thou still addicted to the world, minding and affecting things below, more than the things which are aboue? Therefore the Lord mingleth thy worldly pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peritie with the gall of affliction, that as nurses by laying bitter things vnto their dugs, doe waine their children from them, so hee by affliction might waine thee from the world: and that through bearing the crosse thou mightest bee crucified to the world,<note place="margin">

            <p n="6">6. Hast thou not yet learned patiently to beare the crosse, &amp; to repose thine affiance in God more than in the meanes which God permitteth to thee? Therefore doth he still continue thine affliction, that thy patience might be exercised, and by exercise confirmed, as the Scriptures testifie: therefore doth the Lord bereaue thee of other meanes,<note place="margin">

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18106:53"/>
our affliction be wrought in vs: for if wee desire to bee deliuered out of affliction, before it hath wrought any good effect in vs, wee desire vnawares that God should giue vs ouer as incorrigible.</p>
            <p>When as therefore a faithfull man hath prayed effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually vnto the Lord for deliuerance out of affliction, and yet is not deliuered, let him know that it is not good for him to be deliuered as yet. And withall, let him bee persuaded of these two things: First, that God doth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise him in <note n="1" place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.19.</note> loue, for his <note n="2" place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.10.</note> profit, according to his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie, as being not <note n="3" place="margin">
                  <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.33.</note> delighted with our afflictions: and therefore inflicteth vpon him no greater measure of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, than in his fatherly wisedome he thinketh neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie. And therefore wee ought to possesse our soules in patience, committing and resigning our selues into the hands of almightie God, as of a most wise and louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and most expert phisition of our soules. A sonne that hath any grace in him, will meekely submit himselfe to the chastisement of a wise and carefull father:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9.</note> how much more ought we to submit our selues to the corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our heauenly father? A man that hath in his bodie any wounds or sores, he will not onely be patient, but thankefull also towards the surgeon that launceth or seareth his bodie, that hee may cure it: how much more ought we patiently and thankefully to suffer the Lord to afflict our bodies, that he may saue our soules?</p>
            <p>Secondly, let him be assured that the Lord doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer reject the effectuall prayer of a faithfull man, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes heareth the same graciously, if not according to his desire, yet according to his profit: yea, that hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes graunteth it, if it be rightly conceiued. For as we are to aske spirituall graces necessarie to saluation abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely; so wee are to beleeue absolutely, that God will graunt the same vnto vs: yea this is a certaine and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable truth, that whosoeuer hath thus much grace,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18106:54"/>
truly and earnestly to desire any sanctifying grace, the same grace is alreadie begun in him, the Lord accepting in his children the will for the deed. And as wee are to aske temporall blessings conditionally, so farre foorth as the graunting thereof may stand with Gods glorie and our euerlasting good; so we are to beleeue and to be assured that God will graunt the same, so farre forth as may be for the glorie of his name, and for our spirituall good.</p>
            <p>Wherefore to conclude, if it be good for the children of God to be deliuered out of affliction, the Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth them when they haue called vpon him, according to his most gracious promise in this place: but if it bee not good for them to be deliuered, then deliuerance (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not a blessing) is not within the compasse of Gods promise;<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5.</note> and therefore in stead of that, he giueth them patience with the inward comfort of the holy ghost, bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth and sanctifieth their affliction vnto them, causing it and all things whatsoeuer <hi>to worke together for the good of them that loue him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">

                  </gap>, 28,</note>
            </p>
            <p>And thus much concerning the deliuerance promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, now followeth the fruit of deliuerance obtained. <hi>And thou shalt glorifie me.</hi> Out of which words wee are briefely to obserue foure things: the first, for the comfort of the godly and the terrour of the wicked. For if wee therefore aske deliuerance, that wee may glorifie God, and haue a certaine purpose and setled resolution, after we are deliuered to glorifie him, especially if wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our purpose and resolution by a godly vow; wee may from hence conceiue certaine hope that we shall be deliuered, for so much as wee hereby doe plainely see, that our deliuerance and safetie shall bee joyned with Gods glorie:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 6.4.5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 142.7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 143.11.</note> and therefore may be bold for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our faith to entreat the Lord (as the faithfull haue vsed to doe) that hee would spare vs for his names
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18106:54"/>
sake, and that he would deliuer vs euen for the glorie of his name: that being deliuered, we may praise and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie his name among men, which being dead we cannot do: For as <hi>Dauid</hi> saith, <hi>In death there is no remembrance of thee: in the graue, who shall praise thee?</hi> But if we haue a purpose to continue in our sinnes, and therefore desire deliuerance that we may haue freedome to follow our owne courses; as we cannot intreat the Lord that hee would deliuer vs for his owne name sake, so can we not conceiue hope that we shall be deliuered for our good, seeing our life after our deliuerance is like to be joyned with the dishonour of God.</p>
            <p>The second thing serueth for our instruction. That as we are here taught, so we should not onely acknowledge the glorie of God to bee the end of our deliuerance and preseruation, but also bee carefull to referre the same to the glorifying of God: for this is the supreme end of our life and being: Whereunto if our life be not referred, we liue in vaine. Many when they are in distresse will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise and vow a studie and care of glorifying God after they are deliuered, of which vow notwithstanding after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they are vnmindfull. But it may be asked, how are we to glorifie God? I answer, both inwardly, and outwardly. Inwardly, in our minds, by intending the glorie of God in all things, or as the Prophet <hi>Malachie</hi> speaketh,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.2.</note> 
               <hi>By putting into our harts to giue glorie to his name</hi>; that <hi>whether we eat or drinke, or whatsoeuer we do, all may be done to the glorie of God.</hi>

                  </gap>.</note> Outwardly in our words and deeds. In our words, that we make the glorie of God both the matter of our speech, when we praise and magnifie God, giuing him thankes for our deliuerance, and all other his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, for this is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Luke</hi> 2.20.</note> as <hi>Luke</hi> speaketh chapter 2, and as the Lord professeth in the last verse of this Psalme,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.12, 13, 14, 17, <hi>&amp;</hi> 118, 21.</note> they are carefull to performe. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it cannot be denied but that the greatest part of men forget to bee thankfull, as appeareth by the storie of the ten lepers,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 17 17.</note> to whom being all clensed, one onely retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to giue praise and thankes to God, But let vs in this our affliction for the confirmation of our faith seriously vow these sacrifices of praise vnto God: and if it please God to deliuer vs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.14.</note> let vs bee mindfull to offer vnto the Lord the sacrifice of praise, and pay our vowes vnto the most high: for if with <hi>Dauid</hi> we should deliberat with our selues what to <hi>render vnto the Lord for all his benefits towards vs,</hi> we must resolue as he doth, <hi>to take the cup of saluation,</hi> that is, of thankes for his preseruation of vs,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 116.12.13.</note> and so <hi>pay our vowes vnto the Lord.</hi> And if this be the onely thing almost which we can render vnto the Lord, we are exceedingly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull, if we bee wanting therein. We are also to make the glorie of God the end of our speech, by auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all <hi>idle words,</hi>

               <hi>and rotten speeches, whereby good maners might be corrupted.</hi> And contrariwise, endeuouring that our speech being <hi>gracious alwayes and seasoned with salt,</hi> God may be glorified thereby, and our brethren edified. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we are by our deeds to glorifie God, by bringing forth the fruits of good works: For by this meanes we shall not onely glorifie God our selues (as our Sauiour Christ saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.8. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.16. 1. <hi>

               <hi>Herein is my father glorified that you bring forth much fruit</hi>) but also be authors vnto others of glorifying him, to which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18106:55"/>
purpose hee exhorteth vs so to <hi>let our light shine before men that they seeing our good workes may glorifie our father which is in heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third thing to be obserued, is a twofold doctrine. For first, when God doth promise vs this grace to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, this proueth, that or care and studie to glorifie God, is not a matter in our owne power, but is the free gift of God. And therefore as the Lord here promiseth <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd elsewhere sweareth to giue vs this grace, so are we by earnest prayer to begge the same at his hands, as we are taught in the first petition of that forme of prayer which Christ hath prescribed to vs;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> 6.9.</note> namely, that God would giue vs grace to glorifie his name. And second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas the Lord promiseth to the faithfull that they shall glorifie him: hereby it appeareth that the children of God haue a great desire to glorifie God, and esteeme it as a greater benefit than their deliuerance it selfe, if God will vouchsafe to make them instruments of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: for that they acknowledge to be the end whereunto their deliuerance is to bee referred. Now the end is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes better than that which is destinated thereunto. And the same thing is signified by the order of petitions in the Lords prayer, whereby we are taught to preferre the glorie of God, before those things which concerne not onely our temporall, but also spirituall good.</p>
            <p>The fourth &amp; last thing is a reproofe &amp; check of those who haue no zeale of Gods glorie: for seeing the Lord promiseth to the faithfull that they shall glorifie him, and elsewhere by oath confirmeth that to those that he re-redeemeth he will giue this grace <hi>to worship him in holinesse and righteousnesse:</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Luke</hi> 1.73.74.</note> therefore we may easily discerne in what number they are to be reckoned, who haue no care to praise God for this deliuerance, neither haue any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to glorifie him.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore, that this affliction, and hand
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:18106:56"/>
of God afflicting vs may be remoued; let vs flie vnto God by humble, heartie and effectuall prayer, as we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in this place; let vs humble our selues vnder the mightie hand of God,<note place="margin">

Otherwise if we shall forget this great mercie of God, and dishonour him by our sinnes, we are to feare lest some more grieuous iudgement shall befall vs. As our Sauiour Christ said to the man whom he had cured,<note place="margin">
