            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Houſe being informed that divers Petitioners wer at the Door, they were called in, and Mr. <hi>Praiſe-God Barebone</hi> in the name of the reſt, being come to the Bar, addreſſing himſelf to Mr. Speaker, ſaid, we are come to wait upon this Honourable Houſe with a Petition from ſuch as are lovers of the <hi>Good Old Cauſe;</hi> the Petitioners are ſuch as have adhered to this Parliament, and ſuch as are lovers of Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, Freedom, and lovers of a Common-wealth, accounting it the beſt Government: There are many Subſcriptions, I may ſay thouſands, and in their names I do humbly preſent it to you: And thereupon preſented the Petition, who being withdrawn, the Petition was read, and is as followeth;</p>

               <head>To the PARLIAMENT of the Commonwealth of <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The Repreſentation and Addreſs of the Well-affected Perſons, Inhabitants of the Cities of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>and places adjacent, being faithful and conſtant Adherers to this Parliament, who are reſolved (by the aſſiſtance of Almighty God) to ſtand by, aſſert, and maintain their Authority, againſt all oppoſers, notwithſtanding the preſent confidence and bold attempts of the Promoters of Regal Intereſt, by the declared Enemies of their Cauſe and Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHereas <hi>the good Old Cauſe</hi> was for Civil and Chriſtian Liberty, againſt Oppreſſion and Perſecution; The Oppreſſors and Perſecutors, were chiefly the King, his Lords and Clergy, and their Adherents, who to effect their deſigns, raiſed War againſt the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon the <hi>Parliament</hi> in defence of Civil and Chriſtian Liberty, call the oppreſſed and perſecuted to their aid, by whoſe aſſiſtance the Oppreſſors and Perſecutors have been ſubdued, Kingſhip and Peerage aboliſhed, and perſecution checkt; by which the number of conſcientious Friends to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> have been ſo exceedingly encreaſed, that they are now (by Gods aſſiſtance) in a far more able capacity of keeping down their enemies, than they were in thoſe times when they ſubdued them.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, ſo watchful hath the reſtleſs enemy been to make advantage, that what (time after time) he hath loſt in the Field, he hath endeavoured to regain, even in the Parliaments Council; where becauſe he had not the Face openly to bring in the King, with the former oppreſſions and perſecutions, they ſhrowded and vailed themſelves, one while under a Perſonal Treaty, another while, under a Cloak of Zeal, againſt Blaſphemy and Hereſie, their endeavours being to bring in the King upon any terms; to cheriſh the perſecuting party, and to brow-beat their moſt conſcientious Oppoſers.</p>
               <p>Upon which pretences, nevertheleſs they have, through tract of time, and the unſettledneſs of Government, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo far, as under the notion of a moderate Party, to get the ſubtilleſt of their Friends into many places of Truſt and Command, both Civil and Military, through whoſe countenance and encouragement, albeit the Parliament upon good Grounds, Voted the Government by King and Lords uſeleſs, burdenſom and dangerous; and declare very large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Liberty of Conſcience, yet of late a general boldneſs hath been taken, to plead a neceſſary of returning to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of King and Lords, a taking in of the Kings Son, or which is all one, for a return of the juſtly ſecluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or a Free Parliament, without due Qualifications, whereby the Good Old Cauſe of Liberty, and Freedom (ſo long contended for againſt Regal Intereſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the expence of much Blood and Treaſure) and the aſſertors thereof, will be proſtituted to ſatiſfie the luſts of the Enemies of the Common-wealth, where in they have prevailed ſo far, that unleſs all conſcientious perſons in Parliament, Army, Navy and Common-wealth, do ſpeedily unite, and watchfully look about them, as the Sword will certainly (though ſecretly and ſilently) be ſtolen out of their hands; ſo alſo will they find all Civil Authority fall ſuddenly into the hands of their enraged enemies, and a return of all thoſe violences, oppreſſions and perſecutions which have coſt ſo much Blood and Treaſure to extirpate.</p>
               <p>The Serious apprehenſions whereof, hath ſtirred up your cordial friends to deſire you to uſe all poſſible endeavours to prevent the Commonwealths adverſaries in this their moſt dangerous Stratagem; And as the moſt effectual means thereunto; We pray,</p>
