            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Lord Generall not having time, give me leave to preſent you with a ſhort Relation of Gods late merciful diſpenſation towards our Army: On Saturday night we came to <hi>Kineton</hi> with twelve Regiments of Foot, and about fourty Troops of Horſe, ſome of our Horſe and Foot were behinde to bring on our Traine and Ammunition from <hi>VVorceſter:</hi> On the Lords day morning we had certaine intelligence that the Kings Forces were making towards us; whereupon order was given to draw forth our Forces with as much ſpeed as we could: The Kings Forces came down <hi>Edgworth</hi> Hill about five thouſand Horſe and thirteen thouſand Foot, as the Lord <hi>VVilloughby,</hi> who is priſoner, ſaith; they got advantage of Hill and wind; we had not in the Field above thirty Troops of Horſe, the reſt being quartered further off came not in; About twelve of the clock the Cannon began to play on both ſides, and about an hour after horſe and foot fell to it in earneſt: our left wing upon the ſecond firing fled baſely, and the right wing of horſe led by Prince <hi>Robert</hi> chaſed them, and it ſeemes thinking the day their own, fell preſently to plunder our Waggons, and killing the ſervants, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to women and children which attended them, but our foot and the reſt of the horſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it ſo cloſe, that they wholly cut off the flower of their foot, the Kings red Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and two or three other Regiments, beſides many of their horſe; took many of their Colours, the Kings Standard, ſome Peeces of their Ordnance, drave them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire up the Hill, ſlew the Lord <hi>Jo. Steward,</hi> Sir <hi>Edmund Varney,</hi> one of the <hi>Lunsfords,</hi> and other Commanders, Took Priſoners the Earl of <hi>Lindſey</hi> their Generall, who ſince is dead, his Sonne the Lord <hi>VVilloughby,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Stradling,</hi> Colonell <hi>Vavaſour,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Lunsford,</hi> with other Officers. My Lord kept the Field till about three of the clock in the morning, and then retreated to the Towne; Next morning the Kings Army appeared upon the Hill, and we took the Field again, but it ſeemes they had no minde to receive a Dinner from us, who gave them ſo bad a Supper: we cannot ſay that we loſt above a hundred of our foot, and a few horſe, except the Waggoners and thoſe that attended them; I know not how many of the Kings are ſlain: Colonell <hi>Lunsford</hi> confeſſed unto me, that three Regiments were wholly cut off: Sure I am, God hath given us a great Victory, and ſuch a one (to uſe my Lord Generall his own expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) that in as much as ever in any, there appeared little of man and much of God. For a day or two we are refreſhing our Army hereabouts, and then, God-willing, we ſhall be fit for further ſervice. VVhat order you ſhall receive from my Lord will come from a better hand, and I will trouble you no further, but recommend you to God, and write my ſelfe</p>
