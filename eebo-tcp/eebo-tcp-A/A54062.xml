         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SOME
QUERIES
Concerning the WORK of GOD in the WORLD,
which is to be expected in the latter Ages thereof; With
a few plain Words to the Nation of <hi>England,</hi> tending
towards ſtopping the future breakings forth of Gods
wrath, both upon the People and Powers thereof;
With an Advertiſement relating to the
preſent State of Things.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> I.
VVHether the Kingdoms of the Earth ſhall not one
day become the Kingdoms of the Lord and of his
Chriſt, wherein the Lord God Omnipotent ſhall
Reign, and Mans Glory and Greatneſs fall, that
God alone may be exalted in that day? <hi>Rev. 11. 15, 17. Iſa.</hi> 2. 11,
12, 17, 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> II. When ſhall this be? Whether this is not to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the recovery out of the Antichriſtian Apoſtacy? Whether the
Man-child is not then to be expected to be ſo born and brought forth
as to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron? <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 6. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer</hi> III. When the Son of Man comes to take the Government to
himſelf, to give forth the Law out of <hi>Zion,</hi> and the Word of the Lord
from <hi>Jeruſalem, (Iſa.</hi> 2. 3.) whether he ſhall find Faith on the Earth?
Whether he ſhall find the <hi>Kings</hi> and Powers of the Earth ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, and the Profeſſors willing to ſubmit themſelves unto him?
Or whether they ſhall generally combine againſt him, and he be fain
to overcome them, before he can Reign over them? <hi>Luke 18. 8. Rev.</hi>
17. 12, 13, 14. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> IV. Why theſe things may not be expected in this our day,
and be already begun in this our Nation, ſeeing ſo many ſtrange things
have happened among us, as have not in many foregoing Ages, God
having ſo ſtrangely raiſed up a Generation to do ſervice for him, and

               </gap>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96893:3"/>
ſo ſtrangely again brought them down, when they had ſo long, and ſo
often ſhewed themſelves unworthy of, and unfit for ſo great a ſervice,
by ſtill ſeeking themſelves and forgetting the Lord that raiſed them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> V. How the Kingdoms of the Earth are to become the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of the Lord and of his Chriſt? Whether it be not by taking his
yoak upon them, by ſubmitting to his Laws, his Cords and Bands?
by giving up whatſoever is unjuſt, unrighteous, harſh and oppreſſive,
and coming under the Bands of Righteouſneſs, Meekneſs, and Equity?
<hi>Pſal. 2. 10, 11. Mat.</hi> 11. 29.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> VI. Whether the Lord be ariſen to ſhake terribly the Earth
or no (as was long ago propheſied he ſhould? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. 19.) For
the Lord will once more ſhake both Heaven and Earth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 26.
There hath been a ſore ſhaking in this Nation, the Foundations of
Government, yea the very Foundations of Religion have been ſhaken,
that that which cannot ſtand might be removed out of the way, and
give place to that which cannot be ſhaken, <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. Conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whether theſe be the beginnings of the great and terrible day of
the Lord God Almighty, or only ſome ſuch ordinary ſhakings as uſe
to happen according to the courſe of Kingdoms and States, which are
ſubject to changes, alterations and diſſettlements?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> VII. When God beginneth to ſhake the Heaven and Earth
in Nations (according to that great ſhaking which is to be after the
Antichriſtan Apoſtaſie, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.) Whether there ever
can be any firm ſettlement again upon the old Foundations? There
may appear ſome hopes and probability of a Settlement again, which
man may be tempted to faſten upon; but this will but provoke God
to ſhake more effectually: for when God once ariſeth to ſhake, he
will not give over till he hath made that fall, which he began to ſhake,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 13. O <hi>England</hi> take heed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quer.</hi> VIII. How the <hi>Kings,</hi> Powers, and Nations of the Earth
may ſecure their ſtanding in that day, whether there be any way for
them ſo to do, and what is that way? Whether there be any other way
but kiſſing the Son, ſubmitting to his bands, being willing to be bound
with the chains of Righteouſneſs, Love and Meekneſs, from all unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
and oppreſſion, both relating to their fellow creatures and
to his People? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 12. and 149. 8.</p>
            <p>Come O Nation of <hi>England,</hi> be bound: O Powers of this Nation,
take the Lords yoak upon you, ſeek righteouſneſs, ſeek meekneſs, ſeek
the good of all, not in words and pretences, but in truth and upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
Seek out that which is of God in every one of your hearts, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:96893:3"/>
let that Govern for God. Do not ſmile any for obedience to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
God, but come ye alſo under his yoak, that what is not of God
in your ſelves, but an enemy to your ſouls, may be yoaked down: and
let all Laws be formed, directed, and managed, to reach the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
that the Rod of the wicked may not alwayes lie upon the lot of
the Righteous (<hi>Pſalm</hi> 125. 3.) nor oppreſſion and ſelf-wil ſit in the
Seat of Judgment, and paſs (becauſe of its power and authority) for
righteouſneſs, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 16. and 4. 1. O ye Powers of <hi>England,</hi>
ſave your ſelves and this Nation from the terrible ſtroak of God, which
is very near. And let not this following advice be diſdained by you,
but conſider ſeriouſly of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Take heed how you call any to account for what they have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
you.</hi> There was an extraordinary hand of God in theſe things:
and in falling fowl upon Inſtruments, ye may claſh againſt him before
ye are aware. For their iniquity the Lord hath laid them aſide, and
raiſed you up again, giving you another day of tryal: let that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and look now to your own ſtanding, that ye alſo do not fall, by
following their example of iniquity and unrighteouſneſs. But if you
will call them to account for any thing, let it be for being unfaithful
to God and the People of this Nation, to whom they made large pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
but performed little. And that which God required of them (and
the Nation had reaſon to expect from them) do ye now perform:
Give all men the Liberty of their Conſciences towards God, let them
follow him out of the faſhions, cuſtoms, and worſhip of the World
without interruption: And let there alſo be narrow ſearch after what
is unjuſt, unrighteous and oppreſſive in any kind; and as faſt as it is
diſcovered let it be removed, that the Nation may grow out of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
out of unrighteouſneſs, into ſolidity and righteouſneſs, and that
the fear of offending man may not affright any from fearing, obeying,
and worſhipping of God in ſpirit and truth, as he requireth, and
then God will bleſs the Nation and the Powers of it. For the Lord
God taketh not pleaſure in overturning of Nations, or breaking in
pieces the Powers thereof: yet if they will by no means hearken, but
harden their hearts and ſtand in the way of his Counſel and deſign, he
cannot ſpare them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 4. Therefore ſtand not in battel againſt
him, but bow before him, O ye great ones of the Earth, become low
and little that his wrath may paſs by you; let go your own ſtrength
and greatneſs, and take hold of his ſtrength, that ye may make Peace
with him, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. and do not go about to limit the Spirit of God in his
People, that will moſt certainly ruin you. The Lord God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96893:4"/>
to beſtow his Spirit upon his Sons and Daughters, as in dayes of
old, even as before the great Apoſtacy and Erring from it, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
their obedience to it, and who may ſafely forbid or puniſh
them therefore. Much lies upon this Land in this reſpect, O do not add
more, leſt ye ſink the Nation and your ſelves. Now a little to help
the Nation and Powers thereof the better to digeſt the Work of God,
that they may not run on headily againſt him to their own ruin and
deſtruction, let theſe two things following be conſidered.</p>
            <p>1. Whether the People of God in the dayes of the Apoſtles were not a
ſeparated People, a People gathered out of Nations, Kindreds, Tongues
and Languages (gathered out of the Jewiſh worſhip, gathered out of the
heatheniſh worſhip) and ſeparated to God.</p>
            <p>2. Whether after the Antichriſtian Apoſtacy, there are not a People
to be gathered again, and ſeparated again, from all Antichriſtian
wayes of worſhip, even after the manner as they were before the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
from the heatheniſh and Jewiſh worſhip? And ſo the ſame Goſpel
which gathered at firſt, is after the Apoſtacy to be Preached to gather
men again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Conſider well of theſe things, that ye may not ſet your ſelves
againſt the Lord to croſs him in his work in this Nation. Ye cannot
hinder him from gathering his People now out of this Apoſtatized
ſtate, no more then the Jews or heathen could hinder him from gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Elect then out of their corrupt ſtates. The Reformation out
of Popery was very weak and imperfect, the Lord waited long for the
perfecting of it; but inſtead thereof, there was rather a running
backward towards it again. The Lord hath now at length begun the
work himſelf, letting forth his Spirit upon his People, and gathering
many into it, and is preparing the ſtones of his Temple for his build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and he will aſſuredly build up his Church again, ye cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
ſtop him herein, ye may break your ſelves by attempting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
this burthenſome ſtone out of your way (for indeed it doth lie
ſomewhat offenſively in the way of all Settlements and Governments
according to the fleſhly wiſdom) but it will fall upon and break all
that burthen themſelves with it, though not by outward Might or
Power, yet by that Spirit of Life and Righteouſneſs which is in it,
which the Lord is with to proſper. Conſider theſe things in
Meekneſs, Righteouſneſs, and in the fear of the Lord, even in that
Spirit which is fit to act for God and not againſt him.</p>

               <p>BEcauſe of my dear love to my native Country, and becauſe of the
dregs of that cup which the Lord hath already cauſed it to drink
of, which cannot be ſpared unleſs the Lords Will be effected without
it, which dregs are ſo bitter, terrible and dreadful, as will make the
ſtouteſt heart to faint, and the confidenteſt countenance wax pale:
I ſay for this cauſe, in love am I conſtrained to add theſe few lines more,
that if it be poſſible this Nation may apply it ſelf, in the fear and dread
of the Eternal Majeſty and Power, to make its peace with him againſt
whom it hath long Warred (not onely by much outward wickedneſs,
looſneſs, vanity, and prophaneneſs, but more eſpecially by ſetting up
an invented Form of Godlineſs, and perſecuting the Power) and to
whom it is not yet reconciled in this matter, nor found ſo much as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be reconciled.</p>
               <p>The Lord God of Heaven and Earth, of Glory, of Majeſty, of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Power, Victory, and Dominion over all, who made both Heaven
and Earth, and hath the command of all things therein, he diſpoſeth
of Nations, of Governments, of earthly Powers according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and who may ſay unto him what doſt thou? Who may implead
him for making a rich Nation poor, a Strong Nation weak, or for
bringing down the High and Mighty, the ſtrong, Sto ut, Honourable
and Noble in a Nation, and exalting the poor, the mean, the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted?
And if he turn his hand again, and lay them flat whom he
had lifted up, and exalt the other even unlookt for, who can withſtand
him, or who may contradict him?</p>
               <p>Now what is in the Lords heart (who is thus mighty and abſolute)
he will certainly bring to paſs, how unlikely, how contrary, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
ſoever it ſeem to the eye of man. If he will exalt his deſpiſed
truth (which always was ſo to the eye of the great &amp; wiſe ones of this
world) or give his People Liberty to fear, worſhip and obey him; if
he will have Truth and Righteouſneſs have the Dominion in mens

It is mans way to ſettle himſelf by outward ſtrength againſt outward
ſtrength, and then he thinks he is ſafe, not eyeing the inviſible hand
which turns the wheels, and delights to overturn that which is out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
ſtrong (and ſeemeth unremovable) when it forgetteth him,
and oppoſeth it ſelf againſt him. The Lord God loves to take his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
at the ſtrongeſt, when they are moſt Wiſe, moſt Mighty, even
when nothing ſeems able to deal with them but himſelf. This was it
overthrew the foregoing Powers one after another, they were Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
worldly intereſt, and ſtrengthening themſelves that way, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooking
God who raiſed them, and the work which he had raiſed
them to accompliſh. This turned the hand againſt them which had
been for them, and how then could they maintain their ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p>O that the preſent Generation could ſee the tickliſhneſs of their
ſtanding, and conſider that this is their day of Tryal, and that the
Lord's eye is upon them to obſerve their wayes, to ſee whether they
will now mind Righteouſneſs and the Liberty of his People better than
formerly they did, and that his truth may in its life and power (and
not in ſuch a form or way of worſhip as they may think good to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe)
have its ſcope in the Nation. The Lords eye and heart is upon
his truth (and upon his People:) and as Nations or Powers deal with
that, ſo will he deal with them. O therefore be not deceived, for
though the Lord hath oftentimes long ſuffered his people to lie under
reproach and perſecution (as he did <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt</hi> for divers ages)
yet at length he hath ſtill heard their groans, and hath ariſen to deliver
them: and though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> afterwards with all his ſtrength went af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
them, and made no queſtion but to bring them back again under
his ſubjection (and there was nothing in appearance able to deliver
them from him) yet he could not, but overthew himſelf and his ſtrength
utterly. Ye know not what ſtrong cries and tears were put up to
the Lord, before theſe late Changes, that Righteouſneſs might be
eſtabliſhed in the Nation, and that his people might have liberty to
worſhip him in his fear, and according to the leadings of his Spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being yoaked under any form of worſhip, which their hearts could
not own to be of God. And when the Long <hi>Parliament</hi> was unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly
raiſed up, that was looked upon by many to have been the
means God would have uſed towards the effecting of this: and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
yet deny but that God did make uſe of them in ſome things for
good, for which his name was honoured. But though that inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
did warp, becoming unfaithful to the Lord, diverting from his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96893:5"/>
work and ſervice, towards the ſeeking and eſtabliſhing of themſelves
and their own intereſts, and ſo are at length themſelves juſtly therefore
fallen: yet the Work of the Lord is not fallen as relating to himſelf,
though becauſe of the unfaithfulneſs and ſelf-ſeeking of the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which he began to uſe, at preſent it lieth under much reproach
(and that juſtly as relating to them) yet for all this the Lord himſelf
can bring it about again, and carry it on with better advantage to his
Name, Truth and People, then if it had gone on in their hand: and the
more men ſet themſelves to oppoſe it, the more glory will God get to
himſelf in effecting it.</p>
               <p>Let not therefore my true love to the Nation, and to the preſent
Powers thereof, be deſpiſed by them: but let them fear before the
Mighty God of Heaven and Earth, and in their hearts bow to him
that they may be humbled, and made fit inſtruments in His Hand for
His ſervice, and not be found enemies againſt Him. If they will be
ſit inſtruments for God to work by, they muſt be meek, lowly, poor
in Spirit, waiting in Gods fear for His Counſel, and not hearken to
the fleſhly wiſdome of man, which is his utter enemy, and will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,
adviſe, and inſtruct them to ſettle the Nation and Church
(as they call it) in a way contrary to him. And remember this word,
<hi>Be ſure you ſmite none for obedience to God. Limit not His holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in His People, but limit the unclean and evil Spirit in thoſe who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
themſelves not to be His People.</hi> This is the true intent of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
How can he which Governs aright under God, hurt that
which is of God and for God? Or how can he ſpare that which his
Sword is given him to cut down? O how happy were it for the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
if they would let Truth have its ſcope, and let Righteouſneſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them, and not contend for ſhadows againſt the ſubſtance, but
let the ſubſtance overcome all thoſe ſhadows which have held it in
bondage, and upheld its Enemy.</p>
               <p>The great Enemy of God, all this night of the Apoſtacy, hath been
Antichriſt: who hath not been an open Enemy only, but hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as if he had been for Chriſt, commanding the worſhipping and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring
of Chriſt, yea and with a great zeal taking upon him to cauſe
People to worſhip, according to what he determined to be right: and
thus he getteth into the Temple, erecting an uſurping authority over
the conſcience, ſetting up and compelling to an invented worſhip.</p>
               <p>Againſt this kind of worſhip God hath ſtill been raiſing witneſſes
(but he having the Powers of the earth on his ſide, as was Prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

13. 7. and ſo the truth hath been ſuppreſſed, and falſe Worſhips ſet
up by the Powers of the Earth, according to that proportion they have
drunk of the Golden Cup of Fornication, which doth not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
in one way of manifeſt and groſs falſe Worſhip, but hath many
mixtures and myſteries of deceit in it, <hi>Revel. 17. 2. &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now God hath a time to call for an account of the ſufferings and
blood of his Saints, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 10, 11. He hath a time to judge the
great Whore, <hi>Revel</hi> 17. 1. And when the time of Gods Judgment
comes upon the Earth, God begins with His own Houſe firſt, &amp; ſo with
that which hath taken upon it to ſeparate from <hi>Babylon,</hi> to ſee what he
can find of <hi>Babylon</hi> therein; and he will Judge that before he fall upon
the great body of the myſtery of Iniquity, 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 17. Heb.</hi> 10. 30.</p>
               <p>Now therefore it behoves this Nation to conſider what of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
may be found in it, and to part with it, that it may eſcape the
plagues of <hi>Babylon, Revel.</hi> 18. 4. which are very bitter, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 7, 8,

               <p>1. An invented Form of Worſhip, a likeneſs of the true Worſhip, but
not the true Worſhip it ſelf.</p>
               <p>2. A perſecuting and endeavouring to ſuppreſs the Power of the
Truth, even of the purity of the godly Religion and Worſhip by means
of this Form, becauſe for conſcience ſake men who are taught other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
by the Spirit of God, cannot ſubmit and ſubject thereto.</p>
