            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>IS Excellencie arriuing at <hi>Vlis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing</hi> toward the ende of Iune, bringing with him about 30. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of newe leuied Englishe souldiers, found the Town of <hi>Sluce</hi> beseiged by the Duke of <hi>Parma:</hi> his chiefe forces remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the Ile of <hi>Cassand,</hi> where himselfe was for the most part in person: the rest in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Anns</hi> Land vnder the commaundement of <hi>La Mote,</hi> salue that his horse-men, with some bands of foote, were dispersed vpon the Coast, and vpon Straites, for gard of Dikes and passages in sundrie places.</p>
            <p>These forces of the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> were lodged in such a sort, that there was no accesse vnto them, but v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon narrowe banks: the which were in manie places retrenched and cut off in such sort, as (in respect of the aduantage of the scituation) they were wel able to haue answered, treble their forces that should by land haue inuaded them.</p>
            <p>By sea they had also by Piles, Shippes and boates in shew crossed the hauen, and planted certaine platformes of Ordinance, to beat such ships as should attempt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to succour the Towne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:11327:5"/>
Neuerthelesse, in the iudgement of the best Militarie men, this was founde the onely waie to relieue the Towne, and to that end preparation made of shippes of war to enter, &amp; one or two shipes especially of purpose framed with fire workes very artificially, to haue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken any Bridge and opened a passage, although it had bene much more forcibly closed than indeed that was.</p>
            <p>True it is that the Admirall <hi>Nassau</hi> and his sea cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines made the matter verie dangerous, and required that the forces by land might be also attempted at the same time: and at the first it was by his <hi>Excellencie</hi> ment that the <hi>Camp</hi> should haue bene assailed 3. waies. viz, from <hi>Isendick</hi> Sconce towards <hi>Coxey,</hi> on <hi>Cassand,</hi> &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Ostend.</hi> But vpon more deliberate consideration of the scituation of these places: it was found, that after wee should haue surprized the Sconce of <hi>Isendick</hi> there was no possibility to martch towards <hi>Sluce,</hi> or towards the Enemies Camp, but vpon straight Dikes, with sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie abrupt passages by them fortified in such sort: that a verie fewe might haue made head on that side to anie great Armie, and not to be passed without great slaughter of our people: and long time before we could approche to anie blowes with the Enemie. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therside of <hi>Cassand</hi> the coast so flat and farre out into the Sea, as there was no landing, but as men must wade a great distance in the water, subiect to all the shot of the Enemie that might lye couered vnder the marsh banks, and then no way to approch the Camp, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fortified straights as before. It was therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the onely way to approch the Campe by land, was, from <hi>Ostend,</hi> where his <hi>Excellencie</hi> might in safetie land his forces, &amp; so march to seeke the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie on firme ground in militarie order not confusedly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:11327:5"/>
with so great disaduantage as on the other parts. In the meane time diuers <hi>Burgers</hi> of <hi>Vlisshing</hi> (that mistrusted the coldnesse of the <hi>Admiraltie</hi> and <hi>States)</hi> made offer to his Excellencie, that if they might haue shipping they would vndertake to enter the Hauen: and put into the Town both men and munition without attending any attempt to bee made vpon the Enemie by land, which they sawe to be a matter of great hazard &amp; not possible in reason to take anie effect, the strong scituation of the Enemies Campe considered.</p>
            <p>The reasons that mooued them to doubt the colde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the <hi>Admiraltie</hi> were these. They knew them to bee persons whollie at the deuotion of the <hi>States:</hi> howe small care the <hi>States</hi> tooke of <hi>Sluce, Ostend,</hi> or anie other Townes in <hi>Flaunders</hi> was they say apparant long before, when their souldiers by their Euill pay &amp; prouisions, were manie times reduced to such extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as it was greatlie doubted that necessitie shoulde constraine them to deliuer vp the townes to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. And the yeare 1586. when his Excellencie was mooued to haue imployed his forces into <hi>Flaunders,</hi> (where no doubt he might haue wonne immortall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and reduced againe the most part of that Country to the vnited prouinces) the <hi>States</hi> generally euer disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of anie Enterprize that way: and perswaded his <hi>Excellencie</hi> wholly to that other course of <hi>Ghelderland, OuerYsell. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reasons that mooued the <hi>States</hi> thereto, some suppose were these.</p>
            <p>First, if <hi>Flaunders</hi> should bee regained, then a great number of wealthie men (that were nowe in <hi>Holland</hi> setled) would returne thither, and so impouerish great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie the wealth of <hi>Holland;</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieng 
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11327:6"/>
now the whole or chiefe swaye, would none of that.</p>
            <p>Another reason was, that they found those garrisons of <hi>Sluce, Axell, Ostend, &amp;c.</hi> to exhaust much of the <hi>Holland</hi> contributions, and not to yeelde any commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie againe.</p>
            <p>But the third and most forcible of all, was, that they had as it was thought conceaued a certain icalousie that <hi>Flaunders</hi> lying so neere <hi>England,</hi> her Maiestie might seaze to her owne vse all such Ports, Townes, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of strength as should bee gayned there, and hauing conuenient Ports so neere her Realme for conuenient receipt and succour of her Shipping, should by that meanes be able to rule them, and not be ruled by them. These iealousies and conceipts are supposed to bee the causes that haue made the Estates so colde and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the relieuing this Towne of <hi>Sluce,</hi> albeit the <note place="margin">These insolent speeches of the people were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by a sharp penall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Whereunto they ad many shrewde <hi>Presumptions: First,</hi> that the Enemie was continuallie victualled by their sufferance and <hi>Licences: Secondly,</hi> that euen a little before <hi>Sluce</hi> was besiedged, the States sent for certaine of the best bands out of the Towne, which the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would not consent vnto: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that certaine Shippes were of purpose run a grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d before <hi>Sluce</hi> in such sort as the enemies horsemen might take them: without which it was not possible to haue made any shewe of stopping vp the channell.

            <p>Inprimis, if any Captaines take vp Silkes, Gold lace, Iewels, or other like matters for their owne vse amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to treble their owne entertainement: This being defalked on the warrant for the band, must needs vniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take from the poore Souldier part of his pay.</p>
            <p>If a Captaine borrowe Money of the Treasurer or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other for his owne priuat expences, or giue his bill to the Treasurer to pay his losses in play, or charges in wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full houses, the Bills must alwaies be made in one forme <hi>viz.</hi> Receaued of Master Treasurer so much for the vse of the Companie, &amp;c. albeit the poore Companie may

very well pleade not guiltie of any part therof. The same being defaulked by the Treasurer on the warrant for the band, the poore Souldier is defeated, how trewly so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer her Maiestie paye.</p>
            <p>Or when such multitude of bills signed with any Captaines hand shall be brought vnto the Treasurer, as the whole warrant, both Captaines pay, Officers pay, &amp; Souldiers pay is not able to discharge, hee must needes choose some, and reiect others. In which choyse if the Treasurer be a man that regardes his owne benefit and the choyce left in him, he must needes reiect the honest Creditors, who vpon reasonable prizes and small gaine hauing serued the Companie, can offer little to haue their dew, and choose such as by their excessiue gaynes vndewly made, may offer most, and so the lewde onelie gaine, and the honest Creditors vtterlie defeated.</p>
            <p>Againe if any Captaine haue once taken vp and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his bills for more than his own wages, and the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his whole Companie is able to paye, then to get notwithstanding some more Money to bee defalked on the same warrant, he may with gaine be content to giue 60 <hi>pro</hi> 100. or giue his bill of debt for 100. to the Treasurer, to be defaulked on his warrant to receaue 40, or lesse. And this bill must be made as formably as any other, <hi>viz.</hi> for Armes or apparrell for the vse of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And such a one being able with gaine to giue 30. or 40. in the 100. to be paid his bill, may bee as likely to speede as any of the honest Creditors, who perhappes are not able to giue 10. <hi>pro</hi> 100 without their losse, if the Treasurer bee a man that will bee moued with gaine and haue no Commissioners to guide him.</p>

            <p>For, this cause I suppose in <hi>Ireland</hi> it hath beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed, that the <hi>Auditor</hi> onely (who hath no hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Treasure) was the setter downe of all defal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and the Treasurer onely to pay according to his <hi>Debentur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For surelie when in one pay, a man (in fauoring of vniust bills) may gaine ten thowsand pounds or more, &amp; by dealing iustlie can hardly gaine the twentieth part, it is a great temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to misdrawe an indifferent honest mind: especiallie when the Raynes shall be left wholie in his owne hands.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, as (hauing no fingring of the Treasure) may sit in some publique place, where openlie the Captaines and Creditors maie be heard; and also the complaints of the souldiers. And these Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners after they haue
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11327:17"/>
heard, &amp; also the complaint of the Souldiers: And these Commissioners after they haue heard what is alleaged on all parts, to set downe a publique order: which Bills shal be defaulked on the warrant for the Companie, and which set on the Captaines owne head as debts of his owne.</p>
            <p>But there may be also another greater mischiefe than al this, practized in the militarie acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptes of this time: whereby, albeit the best Auditors in England haue the examination of a Treasurers accompt: her <hi>Maiestie</hi> may be found still in the <hi>Treasurers</hi> debt, albeit he haue forty thowsand pounds of her <hi>Maiesties</hi> in his hands; &amp; both Souldiers and Creditors defrauded, and her <hi>Maiesties</hi> pay slaundered by meanes of this course ensuing.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Treasurer</hi> (when hee accompteth with anie Captaine vpon his warrant) first sheweth him a note of all defaulcations, viz. Bills of imprest, Victuallers bills, Armorers bills, defaulcations certified by the <hi>States,</hi> &amp; other his Creditors or Souldiers bills: his owne new found hundred peny, &amp;c. All this being defaulked, hee setteth down the ouerplus as a debt due to the Captaine. For this cleare debt, the Treasurer giueth to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine an Attestation, and for all the rest of the warrant ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth an Acquittance from the Captaine togeather with his warrant. If vpon these conditions (as perhaps on these and none other the Captaines must take their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts) see then what is likelie to ensue.</p>
            <p>In this course, lightlie if the warrant bee for 2 thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pounds, the defalcations shall bee 1700. or more, and the cleare debt to the Captaine 300. or lesse. Nowe when the Treasurer shall bee called to his accompt, as is commonlie vsed before an Auditor of the presse in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> he produceth his warrant for 2000 pounds, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:11327:18"/>
