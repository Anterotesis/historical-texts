         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>My firſt work then, according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, is, to ſhew you ſome neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations that are couched in the words of the text, but expreſſely ſet down in the

foregoing verſes, and theſe muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed and ſeriouſly thought upon, before any comfortable progreſſe can be made in this <hi>propheticall imprecation</hi> againſt the enemies of <hi>Gods Church,</hi> for their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Combinations, and bloody con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies againſt his people.</p>
            <p>For here we may ſee, as in a glaſſe, much of the confuſed and beſmeared face of our times; and in this Mappe of <hi>Iſraels</hi> troubles, you need go no further to view <hi>Englands</hi> preſent feares and diſtempers, and again in <hi>Iſraels</hi> hope we may gather <hi>Englands</hi> comfortable aſſurance,
That God will do unto their enemies alſo, <hi>as he did unto the Midianites.</hi>

            <p n="1">1 For firſt, are not here preparations? and theſe mighty ones.</p>
            <p n="2">2 And are not here deſignes too? and theſe, be not they harſh and cruell?</p>

               <hi>Here is Malignity ſteeped in blood and dyed in Grain,</hi> like that in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

bloody purpoſes againſt the (then beloved) <hi>Jews,</hi> and like that of the <hi>Midianites</hi> here, a compleat and rare deſtruction, a <hi>well compoſed</hi> deſtruction, (as it were) in print, and <hi>licenced</hi> by one of judgement: The <hi>Church</hi> deſires no more in point of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, on <hi>Gods</hi> and their implacable <hi>ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> then this, that he would but eye this <hi>pattern</hi> in his proceedings againſt them, and do no worſe unto them then he did unto the <hi>Midianites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You will receive but little warmth from this ſcripture untill the ſun be riſen, and we look out for thoſe <hi>obſervations</hi> ſpoken of, ariſing in the <hi>East</hi> of this pſalm, which are here either expreſſely ſet down, or neceſſarily implyed, and I may the more boldly take notice of them, as I paſſe on, becauſe my text includes them alſo in the Relatives, <hi>them,</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> and 2. in the pattern, The <hi>Midianites,</hi> and 3. the <hi>petition</hi> or rather the <hi>repetition</hi> of his firſt ſuit <hi>doe unto them,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>The firſt obſervation is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That God doth ſometimes appear unto his people as one that is both deafe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45816:10"/>
and dumb, and as one that is regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of their perſons and prayers, even then when they are moſt of all beſet with fears, and have great need of help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Obſervation.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2 That in this their beſeiged Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is below the brave ſpirits of Gods children to be affrighted out of their grounded hopes into a conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or an amazed dejection of minde, but rather their Heroick reſolutions are exceedingly hightened as in indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation and magnitude of minde againſt the proud enemie, ſo are they lifted up in faith and greater affiance in God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Obſervation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is one main prop, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the courage of Gods people in ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king times, when they conſider that their enemies be Gods enemies too, when they can intereſt him in their quarrell at home or abroad, as here, Lo thine enemies O Lord, and they that hate thee.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45816:10"/>And then comes in this fourth <hi>Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall obſervation,</hi> very patly from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words of the text.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4. Obſ. That theſe enemies be they never ſo numerous to devour us, ſo cunning to divide us, ſo cruell to murder us, ſo proud to vaunt over us, yet they ſhall be exactly puniſhed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pattern of <hi>Midian,</hi> as ſoon as Gods period and theirs meet together, and are acccompliſhed, as theirs alſo was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt of the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God ſeems to leave his people to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, (though truly and really he doth not) in times of greateſt danger and commotion, and to have but little care of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is evident from the firſt verſe.</p>
            <p>The Church complains, and wonders how he could <hi>be ſtill</hi> while the <hi>enemie</hi> was ſo <hi>buſie</hi>; how he could be <hi>ſilent,</hi> while the Adverſaries <hi>roare</hi> and make a <hi>tumult</hi>; how he could finde in his heart to <hi>hold his peace</hi> and lie down, while theſe vaunt themſelves ſo proudly, and <hi>lift up the head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many ſuch complaints are made by the <hi>Church</hi> in the book of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45816:11"/>
elſewhere abundantly, <hi>Quouſque Domine</hi>? How long Lord? And, <hi>will the Lord ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf for ever</hi>? up <hi>Lord, why ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gods</hi> ends are excellent, and wiſe, and deep, and unfathomable.</p>
            <p n="1">1 And ſome of them belong to his <hi>ſecret purpoſe,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 Others to his <hi>revealed will,</hi> and theſe are.</p>

            <p n="1">1. It was for the <hi>chief Rent</hi> of his own <hi>Glory,</hi> that he hath <hi>farmed</hi> out the world to man for <hi>Term of life</hi>; And when he <hi>ſtrains</hi> upon all again for our <hi>unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> hath not he the great <hi>good</hi> of his <hi>own honour,</hi> out of the <hi>evil of our diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and ſhame, by ſhaming us out of our ingratitude?</p>

ſo little? Of all <hi>Gideons</hi> hoſt, you ſhall finde but 300. <hi>men</hi> that upon tryall, would <hi>bend the knee to lap up the water</hi> of ſuch cold diſcouragements: <hi>Gods people bend most, when he ſeems most ſtiffe and inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>For their advantage</hi> too in reſpect of the Enemie; <hi>They lift up the head</hi> ſaith the Church here, but it is a fatall lifting of it up;</p>

and deſire to be in bondage ſtill) ſhe was baniſhed out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, for perſecuting <hi>Sarah</hi> the Free-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: And ſo was her Son the <hi>Lieutenant Generall</hi> here, who therefore in revenge and deſperate Enmity againſt all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Free-woman, is in <hi>Commiſſion of Array</hi> againſt them, to bring them to Bondage; and now upon rhe march.</p>
            <p>The next in order is <hi>Major Generall Moab</hi>; he it is that leads on the Brigade of the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and theſe were the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous brood of <hi>Lot,</hi> begotten on his own daughter, in their Father <hi>Moab,</hi> Father of the <hi>Moabites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will ſpend no more time in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blazoning their Armes nor yet to tell you what the other Colonels &amp; Commanders were, nor yet of the affinity and neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of <hi>Iſraels</hi> relation to theſe Nations; it is enough to know that they were <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels</hi> enemies, and to enquire out their deſign.</p>
            <p>And what was it? They will cut off the <hi>Name and Nation of Iſrael,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their memory to oblivion, they'l doe I know not what.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:45816:15"/>But what ſay they? doe they fly back; or doe they yeeld and give up all with <hi>Ahab?</hi> No, no; it ſhall not goe there; well may their words, and Names and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions affright children, but it ſhall not daunt them; the Enemy may ſet them up for <hi>ſcarre Crowes</hi> to fright away the birds, but it ſhall never drive them out of the field.</p>
            <p>And it works theſe two notable effects upon all thoſe in whom there is any thing of God to direct them, againſt ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, and ſuch a people;</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Greater dependance on him</hi>; They entitle God in all they have, and in their quarrell too; <hi>Loe thine enemies, and they that hate thee!</hi> As if ſhee had ſaid, <hi>Lord,</hi> we are ready every moment to be daſhed in pieces; and while thou ſleepeſt, we are in a ſtorme, and every moment in danger of the loſſe of ſhip and goods, and our lives too: But art not thou our <hi>Pilote,</hi> and <hi>Maſter,</hi> and <hi>Captaine</hi>?

            <p>And ſecondly, it doth much <hi>advance their magnitude of minde,</hi> in a holy indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt ſuch a baſe degenerate Enemy.</p>

cowards? did they truſt <hi>God</hi> with events, and ſhall wee ſuſpect him, doubt him? could they frame ſuch a charge againſt their enemies? and have we nothing to ſay of ours? or are ours leſſe hurtfull and dangerous then theirs were?</p>
            <p>Come, come, take heart, ye beloved of the <hi>Lord</hi> of this <hi>divided Nation</hi>; never had a people more matter of complaint, to frame a bill againſt a bloody combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then <hi>England</hi> hath at this joincture of time againſt theirs, and yet never had a people more cauſe to truſt God for the future, then <hi>England</hi> hath at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>You may draw up a charge againſt them according to the experience you have had of their pride, inſolency and bloodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord,</hi> how oft haſt thou broken in pieces, and rent all to ſhivers the united Forces of the Malignant Enemy of this Nation? and yet behold they unite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; how oft haſt thou befoold their cunning? yet they will ſtill have a Iuncto; how many of them haſt thou ſatiated with their own rage, and glutted with their

own goare? and yet ſtill they thirſt for more blood. How ſhamefully hath their own deſpite, hatred, murther, plunderings, (and yet it is but the ſcatterings of them) recoiled upon their own eſtates, names, families, confederates? and yet ſtill <hi>they prepare their arrow to ſhoot at thoſe that are perfect in the land</hi>: How like a fierce man of Warre, haſt thou broken in upon their pride, preſumption, nobility, and haſt thrown them upon the very dunghill of ſhame and diſhonour, as things of no value, and uſeleſſe? and yet their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits be not broken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord,</hi> make our <hi>Edomites</hi> like their <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> our Princes like their Princes, <hi>Oreb</hi> and <hi>Zeb</hi>: Theſe forces that will warre againſt <hi>England,</hi> like thoſe Armies that did war againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi>; and either fill their faces with ſhame, that they may ſeek thy name, or elſe

            </p>
            <p>And thus the extreame barbariſm, odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, and filthy naſtines of thoſe Nations, that doe or ſhall at any time appear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

               <hi>England,</hi> will ſerve to prop, and mainly to hold up the Churches confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the <hi>Lord of Hoaſts,</hi> unto whom all the recited abominations againſt his <hi>Iſrael</hi> are moſt hatefull:</p>
            <p>Which clearly leads me to the third Obſervation,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Obſ. <hi>That it is no ſmall pin or prop in ſupporting the faith of Gods people in ſhaking times, to conſider that their enemies be Gods enemies too.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See in this Pſalm, how the faith of Gods people leanes upon this very <hi>Conſideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Why <hi>Lord!</hi> Thou that madeſt the eye, doſt not thou ſee? thou that madeſt the eares, doſt not thou hear? thou that giveſt man underſtanding, doſt not thou conſider? Why, they be <hi>thy enemies,</hi> as well as ours; they <hi>hate thee</hi> as well as us: If they <hi>once root</hi> out <hi>our nation,</hi> they'l ſoon deſtroy <hi>thy name,</hi> ſo that thy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and thy people will be cut off and deſtroyed together; and if we loſe much by their cruelty, thou art like to loſe more in thy honour, and thy name amongſt an

ignorant and barbarous people. Alas <hi>Lord!</hi> their enimity will pay thee home, though we have but little to loſe; and all we have is but poore ſtuffe, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the rich precious pillage they will have of thee.</p>
            <p>See, I ſay, how they reſt themſelves upon this leaning ſtock.</p>
            <p>I will give you but one pregnant place for many, to prove the Churches practiſe of this duty, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.2. <hi>The Kings of the Earth ſtand up<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Rulers take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell tegether againſt the Lord and againſt his Christ</hi> That which ſhee leanes upon, is this, that they roſe up againſt the <hi>Lord</hi> firſt, and againſt <hi>his annointed</hi> next; And upon this conſideration ſhe ſings this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiem to her ſelfe,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hee that dwelleth in Heaven ſhall laugh them to ſcorne, the Lord ſhall have them in deriſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it is then, you ſee that the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the deſpitefulneſſe and enmity of wicked men againſt God himſelfe is a maine <hi>leaning ſtocks, or prop, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the faith of Gods people in ſhaking times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:45816:18"/>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 1. The life of Doctrine is in appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; And the particular knowledge of this truth would bee of excellent uſe to <hi>cure our faith of much perplexity and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> how it is poſſible wee ſhould extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate our ſelves from dangers, when wee are ſo cloſely and powerfully beſieged and begirt about with whole Armies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations of feares, and treacheries, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without us. Truly ſome thoughts of this conſideration would hold us up, as it were by the hand, even in out very ſinkings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore didſt thou doubt O thou of little faith</hi>? ſaid Chriſt, to his beloved <hi>Peter</hi>; hee would not have had him to have doubted, no not then when hee was ſinking.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay perhaps as <hi>Peter</hi> might have pleaded for his doubting (and it appeares he did by his ſinking) why <hi>Lord,</hi> The waters be deepe, and the waves roare, and <hi>rage horribly</hi>; how can a man bee blamed then, being in the very jawes of ſuch a danger? ſo haply wee may (nay we do too often) object to the weakning of our faith, ſuch deſpondencies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:45816:19"/>O! the Enemy is deepe in Councell, and Legions for number, and burning for rage, and well appointed for cruelty, and a very Lucifer in pride and preſumption up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all theſe.</p>
            <p>But let us thinke, what are their Councells <hi>to Gods decrees?</hi> and their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes to his? and their rage to his <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is the daring haughtines of a <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Pigmee</hi> to the loftineſſe of an <hi>infinite God, that rides upon the wings of the wind, and ſits betweene the Cherubines</hi>? and what is the <hi>Childs Pot-gun</hi> of mans hatred to the <hi>roaring Cannon</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> indignation? How whe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Let this ſupport thee; <hi>the Lord of Hoſts is with thee, the God of Iacob is thy refuge</hi>; And all that ſtrength of his by Sea and Land, and <hi>the Starres too in their order,</hi> are engaged with thee in the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, if thou be an <hi>Iſrael its indeed,</hi> and a member of <hi>Gods Church?</hi>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45816:19"/>

Why then would they War with the wind?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vſe</hi> 2. Wee have matter very uſefull to contemplate upon in ſuch ſtirring and tumultuous times as theſe be, and from whence our Meditations may take their flight into <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> or any other places where <hi>England</hi> hath any enemies; to bring us tydings whether the generality and <hi>Randezvouz</hi> of Gods enemies be with them or with us, here lies the great queſtion, and here will be the diſpute, whether or no do they joyne themſelves to ſuch of any of theſe Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have oppoſed themſelves againſt us, or doe they ſide with us againſt them?</p>
            <p>Believe it, this is a moſt materiall uſe, in ſuch a time, and amongſt ſuch a people, ſo mixed for judgement and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about this matter, and therefore

               <hi>That theſe, and all theſe, be they never ſo proud, and cruell, and cunning, and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, yet they ſhall be exactly puniſhed according to the patterne of Midian, as ſoon as Gods period and theirs meete to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and are accompliſhed, as theirs alſo was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could branch this Doctrine into three parts, but I will contract them into two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the numerous combinations of their adverſaries, although their mutuall pride and hatred of one another divide them into parties and into a diverſity of falſe worſhips amongſt themſelves, and doe oft engage them in Warre one against another, yet their diviſions are ſo cemented with helliſh cunning that they have joyned all their forces againſt the Church as one man for a time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let their craft bee what it will bee,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45816:22"/>
God will out match them in their craft, and outvie them in their cunning, and do unto them as he did unto the Midianites, if they proceede.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Though they jarre amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet they can joyne againſt Iſrael; you know of whom they learned that,</hi> viz. <hi>of the prince of darkneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Chriſt complaines that his people are not <hi>ſo wiſe in their Generation</hi> as theſe be.</p>
            <p>It is evident to all that have beene any thing read in the Scriptures, and Hiſtory of theſe Nations (mentioned in this Pſalme) how different they were from one another, in profeſſion and practiſe, in affection and action; I will not ſay in a variety of Religions, (there being but one only rightly ſo called) but in a diverſity of <hi>Paganiſme</hi> and <hi>Semi-paganiſme,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt profane and idoratrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>This is noted in the Book of the <hi>Iudges, Iudg.</hi> 6.3. As ſoone as <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſowen, the <hi>Midianites came up and the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lakites, and the children of the Eaſt</hi>; ſtrange, that <hi>Amaleck,</hi> and <hi>Midian,</hi> and theſe ſhould now joyne together that had ſo
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45816:23"/>
much differed before, but ſo it was, they made a match <hi>to deſtroy the encreaſe of the earth,</hi> and to make <hi>Iſrael poore, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This maſter peece of this craft is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the Apoſtles in their prayer, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.25, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Why doe the Heathen rage, and the people imagine a vaine thing? the Kings of the earth stand up, and the Rulers take councell together againſt the Lord and againſt his Chriſt; for of a truth againſt thy holy child Ieſus, whom thou haſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, both</hi> Herod <hi>and</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>with the Gentiles and People of Iſrael were gathered together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a notable inſtance I ſhall give you out of the <hi>Acts,</hi> Acts. 17.18. There you read, when the Apoſtle diſputed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the idolatry of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of the <hi>Epicurans</hi> and <hi>Stoickes,</hi> joyned together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would have <hi>hiſſed him out of Schoole:</hi> one would have thought that the rigid <hi>Stoickes</hi> (who were ever ſtrict in opinion, and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) would have been aſhamed to joyne with theſe looſe Epicures that were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:45816:23"/>But it is no wonder; our age will furniſh us abundantly with inſtances of this kind; we have men that cannot endure one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hate the very names and nations of each other; yet, like the <hi>wilde Boars</hi> of the Forreſt, they can herd together to root up <hi>Gods Vineyard,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>Vine which his own right hand hath planted:</hi> And theſe like <hi>Sampſons Foxes,</hi> Judges 25.4. though they look ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways with their heads, yet <hi>they can joyn tail to tail to burn up Gods Harveſt,</hi> and to deſtroy a fruitful Land.</p>
            <p>What may be the Ground of this their rage?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Fear,</hi> leſt the <hi>prosperous riſing</hi> of theſe ſhould be the <hi>fatal ruine</hi> of them; and <hi>Moſes</hi> Obſervation proves this clearly to our hands; <hi>Exod.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>Behold the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the children of Iſrael are more and mightier then we; come on, let us deal wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them, leſt they multiply, and it come to paſs, that when there fall out any War, they joyn alſo unto our enemies, and fight againſt us, and ſo get them out of the Land; therefore they did ſet over them task-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to afflict them.</hi>

for nothing elſe, but for being better then himſelf, and more holy, and more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly: And it will be worth your pains to take notice what havock Sin, and Hatred, and Revenge (the top of Satans kindred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, and of the ſerpentine brood in hell) have made in the world: For did not <hi>one of the brood</hi> (but now named) deſtroy the fourth part of the world in the murder of <hi>Abel?</hi> And had not the Church of God a great loſs by loſing ſuch a Pillar as <hi>Abel</hi> was?

The hatred of this helliſh brood being ſuch as either to make way for the drowning of Gods Church with the world of the wicked, or ſeeing Gods Favour to his Church prevented him in that deſign, it was ſome ſatisfaction to his rage, that Gods

            <p>This very deſign, and helliſh cruelty of Satan upon <hi>England, Scotland, and Ireland,</hi> in point of deſtruction and cruelty, is next to Satans hatred in the Flood: For how many hundred thouſand men, women and children, did this <hi>curſed brood</hi> cut off in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> How many in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> fell by the Sword, and Famine, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment, upon the ſame account of this enmity of the ſerpentine race againſt the womans ſeed?

            <p>I anſwer, That it is both a prayer, and a prophetical Imprecation, or Prophecy. As it is a prayer, you have the Churches minde, as if ſhe had ſaid in plainer terms thus: <hi>O Lord, we have heard of thee in times of

<q>Do unto them as unto the Midianites.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So then becauſe the Prophet here tells us
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45816:30"/>
that <hi>God</hi> will proceed againſt the Enemies of the Church, according to the pattern of <hi>Midian.</hi> It muſt be my work to ſhew you, 1. <hi>Who be Gods Enemies.</hi> And 2. <hi>What theſe Midianites were.</hi> And 3. <hi>How they were puniſhed.</hi> This, I ſay, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be unfolded, becauſe the ruine of theſe is made a pattern for the deſtruction of Gods Enemies.</p>
            <p>1. Who be theſe Enemies?</p>
            <p>In general terms, they are <hi>Gods Enemies</hi> that hate <hi>his Friends,</hi> as here, <hi>Lo thine E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,</hi> and <hi>they that hate thee:</hi> How ſo? They have ſaid, <hi>Let us cut them off from being a Nation:</hi> They were <hi>Iſraels</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and therefore <hi>Gods</hi> Enemies by good conſequence.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Amalek</hi> was reputed one of the worſt of <hi>Gods Enemies,</hi> becauſe his hatred was ſo deſperate, and bent againſt his <hi>dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Iſrael,</hi> God is reſolved to give him no quarter, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.8, 9. He ſwore he would have <hi>war with him from generation to generation,</hi> becauſe he was ſuch an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:45816:30"/>
               <hi>God</hi> hath Enemies of two ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Profeſſed ones,</hi> ſuch as openly go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to extinguiſh the light of his Truth in the day time; I mean, that is ſo manifeſtly ſeen, that all may diſcover their meaning to be ſo, as if it were at noon day; ſuch of old were the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> the <hi>Amorites,</hi> the <hi>Amalakites,</hi> the <hi>Midianites:</hi> Theſe did oppoſe, and hate Gods <hi>Iſrael</hi> then, as the <hi>Turks</hi> and others do now, to whom the very name of a Chriſtian is odious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. God hath <hi>cloſer Enemies</hi> too, and theſe are ſuch as do paint themſelves with the profeſſion, and do ſhroud themſelves under the name of the Church and of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but yet indeed are enemies to the Truth of Religion: Now ſome of theſe profeſs a different kinde of Religion, and do uſe another manner of worſhipping <hi>God</hi> then the true Church uſeth; ſuch were the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> of old, who after their rent from the Jews retained <hi>Circumciſion, boasted of their fathers, and expected the Meſſiah,</hi> yet were they not Gods people, but were deadly Enemies to them, and therefore the Jews had no dealing with them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.9. Such are the Papiſts now, who though they retain ſome broken frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45816:31"/>
of <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> yet they do hate <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and the powerful preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Word amongſt us. I wiſh we had leſs familiarity with them; we have payd well enough for it theſe eight years.</p>
            <p>Other Enemies God hath in the midſt of us, of whom the old Complaint is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>O miſeros nos qui Chriſtiani dicimur &amp; Gentes agimus ſub nomine Chriſti!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wretches that we are! we will be called Chriſtians, yet we play the Turk (and worſe) under the name of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Such as deny the power of godlineſs,</hi> be his Enemies. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. Such as will not ſubmit unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his gracious Government, theſe be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies too.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But thoſe mine enemies, that would not ſuffer me to raign over them, bring hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſlay them before me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such as hate and ſpeak againſt the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preaching of the Word, and ſeek, with <hi>Elimas,</hi> by railing againſt ſuch exerciſes, to turn others (as he would have done the Deputy) from the Faith: What ſaith the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> of ſuch? <hi>Thou wretch, thou

ſon of perdition, thou child of the divel!</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Elymas</hi>) and we may very well rank all the Romiſh Clergy amongſt theſe who lock up the word of ſaith from the vulgar in an unknown tongue.</p>
            <p>Here alſo are to be liſted all ſuch as do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile &amp; reproach the <hi>footſteps,</hi> of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

Such as hate to be reformed, and cry out with <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi> and the Malignants with him againſt the Reformers, yet take too much upon you: and utterly deſpiſe Government, they be no better then <hi>Mutiners</hi> and <hi>Murmurers</hi>: and if the ſin bear proportion with the puniſhment; ſee what it is <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.32.</p>
            <p>They that will not be reclaimed from the errour of their wayes, but go on ſtill in any wicked courſe; if mercy will not melt them, nor judgements break them; If Gods favour neither allure them, nor his frowns deterre them from the vaine and profane courſes of their lives, but
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45816:32"/>
Malignants will be Malignants ſtill, and ſwearers ſwearers ſtill, and drunkards drunkards ſtill, and Haters of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wilfull ſtill: ſee what <hi>David</hi> ſaith, will become of them <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.21. <hi>God will ſurely wound his Enemies, and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch an one as goeth on ſtill in his ungodlineſſe.</hi> They are his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and God ſaith he will wound them for it: Now here falls in all the deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and implacable Enemies of this nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; once or twice beating will not ſerve their turn; put them under deck, there's no truſting of them, they'l ſink the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell they are ſo deſperate; give them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, they'l run to <hi>Kent</hi>; fright them from thence, they'l go to <hi>Colcheſter</hi>; favour, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there, they'l run to <hi>Scotland,</hi> or prove worſe then <hi>Red-ſhanks</hi> at home.

            <p>Theſe, theſe be they, and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45816:32"/>
come within the Liſt of this propheſied deſtruction. Indeed my Text includes one as well as another; but yet it is plain here from the pattern humbly offered unto <hi>God</hi> by his Church to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt the Enemy, that it is a cloſe, neer, ſecret, inſinuating Enemy, that the Church aims at; ſome of theſe Nations now upon the march were of neere rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and allie to them; theſe by the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of kin &amp; contiguouſnes of dwelling had thoſe advantages againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers could not have; It was that curſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that <hi>Midian</hi> took to make them Idolaters before, which ſtrangers could not have had; &amp; their puniſhment did bear aequi page with the deſtruction they wrought upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> by that means, that the Church in this place deſires <hi>God</hi> to cut out the future puniſhments for the backs of his <hi>Enemies</hi> according to this pattern.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2.</hi> What were the Midianites?</p>
            <p>Theſe were the poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> by his Concubine <hi>Keturah</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1.32. who being turned <hi>Idolaters</hi> drew <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> to ſin in the wilderneſſe (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) for which <hi>Moſes</hi> revenged the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> of them by the <hi>ſlaughter of all

their males</hi> and <hi>their five Kings and a wonderfull great ſpoil</hi> but afterwards recovering and oppreſſing <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his own land, were by <hi>Gideon</hi> and 300 men vanquiſhed when they lay in the valley like <hi>Graſhoppers</hi> for number. <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>3. What was their offence?</p>
            <p n="1">1. They did invade <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſought to drive them out of the Land, the <hi>Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance</hi> which <hi>God</hi> gave them; that's all their language when they are once enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged: <hi>let us cut them off, let us root them out,</hi> they can bid no lower then ruine and murder and bloodſhed: The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> notes that in <hi>Saul,</hi> before he became <hi>Paul,</hi> that he <hi>breathed out threatnings</hi> againſt the Churches of God no leſſe then this; either a ſtoning, or a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and oh the inſatiableneſſe of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, the depth of Crueltie that is in the heart of <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity!</p>
            <p>What theſe did, or would have done to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that the cruell Miſcreants of <hi>Ireland</hi> have done to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they made away <hi>their wives, their lives,</hi> they invaded their poſſeſſions, their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which God gave them upon <hi>Irelands</hi> Attainder of blood and crueltie upon the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45816:33"/>
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> long fince, who lived amongſt them, and though many of them were not of the beſt or ſcarce Civill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: yet the generality of the Civill, and induſtrious carriage of the Engliſh nation there among them, had brought them in part, out of their Native rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and extream Barbariſme.</p>
            <p>O how many Invaders hath <hi>England</hi> had! as well as thoſe poor ſouls, now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Altar crying, how long Lord? Have not the <hi>Iriſh</hi> invaded? and were not more ſent for to invade? and are they not called Roman Catholique Subjects, to prepare them to be the better entertained by the diſaffected Subjects here? have not <hi>Scotland</hi> invaded? and the <hi>Welch</hi> invaded? the <hi>Walloones</hi> invaded? and what think you <hi>Engliſh men,</hi> did they come for your good? or for your goods? for your cure? or for a curſe? to ſave you? or to deſtroy you? Have they left no ruinous heaps? no bloody footſteps? no ſcarres or cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters yet viſible? are we cured? or are we bleeding ſtill? Beleeve it, beleeve it, they came to <hi>drive you out,</hi> not <hi>to ſettle you</hi> in your dwellings: not to adde unto your ſtrength, but to take away your
<pb facs="tcp:45816:34"/>
ſtrength and your glory, to cut your lockes, not to curl them; and then with the <hi>Philiſtines</hi> to plow with your heifer, and make you a ſcorn and deriſion to all nations: Give credit to none that plead for them, let their pretences be as plauſible and pleaſant as the light; Their aime. is darkneſſe and confuſion, and wo to the Common wealth of <hi>England</hi>: if they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them they are a ſpurious brood, not a free-born people that tell you otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>Thus they are <hi>Invading Midianites,</hi> as well as the old <hi>Midianites</hi> were.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are vexing <hi>Midianites,</hi> the troublers of our Iſrael: the old ones vexed <hi>Iſrael</hi> twenty yeeres; and how many yeers ſuppoſe ye have the young ones vexed and troubled <hi>England?</hi> How many yeeres hath this intoxicating drink of Civill warres been brewing? and now to what paſſe have they brought us? To divide the head from the body firſt? the body politicke, and then the Members of Chriſts body alſo from one another, the body myſticall?</p>
            <p>How truly may diſtreſſed <hi>England</hi> take up that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> pſal. 129.1.2.3. <hi>Many a time have they aefflicted me from my youth up (may England now ſay) yea many a time have they afflicted me from
<pb facs="tcp:45816:34"/>
my youth up; but they have not prevailed againſt me, the plowers plowed upon my back, &amp; made long their furrows, but the righteous Lord wil hew their ſnares aſunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The old ones <hi>deſtroyed the fruit of the Earth, and left no ſuſtenance for Iſrael:</hi> And what have theſe done leſſe? have they not deſtroyed where ever they have been? Is there not a ſcarcity of proviſion every where? but eſpecially in the north? and what is the <hi>famine</hi> and the <hi>ſword</hi> (yet devouring) but the print, and direfull <hi>footsteps</hi> of their <hi>Malignity?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that though the <hi>Midianites</hi> be dead, and <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> be cut off, yet their <hi>malice</hi> doth yet remain <hi>alive,</hi> and it is but <hi>vetus fabula per novos hiſtriones.</hi> An old <hi>Tragedy</hi> of <hi>Malignant Midian</hi> newly acted over by our <hi>Malignant Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and <hi>Iriſh.</hi>

            <p n="3">3.

            <p>And <hi>wo be to them through whom the offence cometh,</hi> for it will be done unto them as <hi>unto the Midianites.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And was it not a <hi>ſtinging ſcourge</hi> upon the ſhoulders of <hi>Ahab,</hi> Who after he had in his thoughts acquitted himſelf of all fear and danger of death, yet then to be taken off, and cut in peices?

mercy waits to ſee whether they will be yet quiet, and faine would the <hi>Gracious God</hi> rather fill their faces with ſhame, by beating them, that he might beat them into obedience, then to be forced by their guilt of more inſurrections and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to do unto them as he did unto the <hi>Midianites.</hi>

            <p>There are divers <hi>diſtinctions</hi> of <hi>hatred</hi> amongſt the learned; I will pick out but two for this purpoſe. <hi>Hatred</hi> is either <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,</hi> or <hi>comparative</hi>: There is no fear that you will hate them <hi>abſolutely</hi>; but it is <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative hatred</hi> they ſuffer under, that is, when you do not love them ſo much as you ought; or when you can find more time to bring off a <hi>Malignant,</hi> then you can find
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45816:47"/>
to preſerve a friend from ruine and death. And ſo the <hi>beloved wife</hi> and the <hi>hated</hi> are diſtinguiſhed in the <hi>Law.</hi> She is ſaid to be <hi>hated,</hi> not that ſhe was ſo <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was not <hi>ſo well beloved</hi> as the other. Thus your friends think they are deeply hated and wronged, according to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; becauſe they are not looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as they ought to be, nor could they ever have <hi>one diſpatch</hi> for all their <hi>Loyalty,</hi> for <hi>an hundred</hi> that others have had for all their <hi>treachery.</hi> Indeed there was this <hi>diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> to your friends: Your enemies brought mony, your friends had laid out all and more, and as much as they could borrow beſides: Your enemies were Gentlemen, &amp; had good clothes to put a glittering garn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh of good oratory upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their hatred of you; your friends had no Counſel to plead for them, but beggery and their old clothes, and broken eſtates and crackt credits, and it may be a printed Petition or two;</p>
            <p>And <hi>a Hoſpital is a more unwelcome ſight then Goldſmiths-hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is <hi>comparative hatred</hi>; when the <hi>Spittle</hi> is not ſo well beloved as the <hi>Mint</hi>; when <hi>both</hi> were <hi>children</hi> of your own <hi>beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> Ah ſirs, let us ſee that you be the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45816:47"/>
of our Country; if you will be <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> and indulgent ones, ſure your <hi>Cripples</hi> and thoſe that have been <hi>lamed</hi> under the <hi>cart-wheel</hi> of your <hi>preſſures,</hi> ſhall have a more <hi>tender ſpecialty</hi> of your <hi>proviſion</hi> for them, then thoſe <hi>rebellious children</hi> that have their <hi>limbs,</hi> but would nor work, or elſe fled out into <hi>open Rebellion</hi> againſt you with <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom.</hi> I pray think on it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hatred</hi> hath another diſtinction for our uſe. It is either 1 <hi>formall,</hi> or 2 <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative.</hi> By the former is meant ſuch <hi>hatred</hi> as a man entertaines <hi>wittingly</hi> and upon <hi>actual conſideration</hi>; by the latter, ſuch as by which (though there be no intention ſo to do, yet) a man doth the ſame things in effect, as if he did purpoſely hate a thing. It was <hi>Wiſdomes</hi> ſpeech, Prov. 8. <hi>He that ſinneth againſt me, hateth his own ſoul.</hi> Now <hi>no man yet ever hated his own fleſh, much leſſe his ſoule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He that ſpareth the rod, hateth his ſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning is, that if he hated him indeed, he could not doe him a worſe turn.</p>
            <p>Ah Gentlemen, your <hi>friends complain</hi> bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly of this kind of hatred, that you do that againſt them, that if you hated them
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45816:48"/>
indeed, you could not do them a worſe turn; if you ſhould as ſeriouſly and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively ſtudy their <hi>irreparable overthrow,</hi> as they have ſtoutly fought for your <hi>ſafety</hi> and <hi>Preſervation,</hi> you could not go a neerer way to <hi>overturne</hi> them <hi>irrecoverably</hi>; your <hi>good words</hi> invite them to wait on you; and <hi>God forbid</hi> you ſay, <hi>but they ſhould be relieved,</hi> and but that their <hi>Grievances ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed</hi>; your <hi>Declarations,</hi> and <hi>publike Acts</hi> concerning them, give them aſſurance you intend what you ſay too; all this is well: who could imagine that theſe <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> could be effects of your <hi>hatred?</hi> he that would affirm ſuch a truth were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be <hi>queſtioned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They waite upon you a moneth; two, three; nay they tarry a year, two, three, foure; there ariſe great <hi>contention</hi> in the mean time, between <hi>them</hi> and their <hi>Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, Landladies,</hi> the <hi>Cook,</hi> the <hi>Brewer</hi> muſt be paid, the <hi>Baker</hi> muſt have money: the <hi>Cook</hi> cannot buy meat: much <hi>complaining</hi> and <hi>reaſoning, excuſing</hi> and <hi>accuſing</hi> there muſt needs be of courſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Concluſion</hi> is, your friends be <hi>turned out of doors, and bid miſchief take them, and their maſters that ſet them on work,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45816:48"/>
and the devill pay them their Arrears</hi>; O the language! you will underſtand it better then I can expreſſe it with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty.</p>
            <p>But I had forgot, there is another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>hatred,</hi> as well as <hi>comparative</hi> and <hi>poſitive,</hi> and that is, there is a <hi>negative ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi>; that is, when there is <hi>no love at all.</hi> Truly your friends ſay they can make <hi>Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit</hi> of this too: it is the <hi>property of love,</hi> wherever it is rooted, to <hi>command</hi> all the <hi>faculties</hi> within, to be imployed for the good of them we love.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dies Nocteſque, me ames, me ſonnies, me deſideres, de me cogites, &amp;c.</hi> Beleeve it, if you loved <hi>your friends,</hi> your eye would be upon them; if you loved them, your ſouls would be with them; you would enquire whether they be alive or no; they could not ſtarve, while you <hi>feaſt</hi>; and you would not let them <hi>ſigh,</hi> when you <hi>ſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>love is learned,</hi> and <hi>love is witty</hi>; If you had <hi>love,</hi> you could not be ignorant what their ſervices have been, what their ſufferings are, and all for you, theſe things you would know too; again, <hi>Love is witty,</hi> in <hi>deviſing means</hi> for the good of them we <hi>love</hi>; you would find an <hi>hundred ways</hi> to
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45816:49"/>
enjoy your <hi>Love</hi>; you would quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to which cloſet, to which cheſt you will go to take out <hi>a pair of gloves,</hi> to ſingle out the other <hi>bugle-purſe of gold,</hi> to convey into your <hi>Loves hands.</hi> Your friends com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain they cannot ſee any <hi>ſeale of your love</hi>; but now and then they receive a <hi>Letter of commendation,</hi> which they fear is <hi>complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> and though the <hi>Court</hi> be down, they meet with <hi>Courtiers</hi> ſtil But, <hi>Migremus hinc,</hi> There's no tarrying for me here.</p>
            <p>I pray <hi>Do not hate your Friends,</hi> but <hi>love them.</hi>

Will ye hear then what a Charge <hi>Tertullus</hi> brought in againſt him to <hi>Felix?</hi> Truly, ſirs, if you would but look <hi>diſcerningly in this Glaſſe,</hi> you might behold the <hi>bluſhing faces</hi> of your <hi>friends,</hi> and the <hi>brazen foreheads</hi> of your <hi>enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Speak, <hi>Tertullus</hi>; here's your <hi>Fee. Tertullus</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Act.</hi> 24. from the ſecond verſe &amp;c. <hi>Seeing that by thee we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained great quietneſſe, and that many worthy things are done to this Nation through thy providence,</hi> (Malignants love quietneſſe? do they wiſh <hi>worthy things to a Nation</hi>? O impudence! Well, proceed) <hi>We accept it alwayes, and in all places, moſt noble Felix, with all thanks.</hi> (O treacherie! I can ſcarce forbear) <hi>But that I be not tedious to thee, I pray thee that thou wouldeſt hear us</hi> (not hear me; <hi>Tertullus</hi> pleads for dangerous <hi>Malignants,</hi> as you ſhall ſee; <hi>hear us,</hi> ſaith he) <hi>of thy courteſie a few words.</hi> Why, what's the matter, <hi>Tertullus? Certainly we have found this man (Paul</hi> he means) <hi>a peſtilent fellow, a mover of ſedition, a chief maintainer of ſects,</hi> (it may be ſo, <hi>Tertullus,</hi> yet for all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45816:52"/>
that, <hi>Paul</hi> may be an <hi>honeſt man</hi>; for <hi>after this manner which you call hereſie,</hi> ſects, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>ſo worſhip we the Living GOD.</hi> Well go on:) <hi>Who hath gone about to deſtroy the Temple,</hi> (it was but the <hi>pollutions</hi> of the <hi>Temple.</hi> But go on:) <hi>Whom we tooke, and would have judged according to our Law,</hi> (that's right ſtill) <hi>but that Lyſias the chief Captain with great violence took him out of our hands.</hi> That is the <hi>ſpite</hi> of your <hi>enemies,</hi> and the very heart-breaking of them, that your <hi>friends</hi> were taken <hi>violently</hi> out of their hands by Captain <hi>Lyſias,</hi> by your <hi>Martial power.</hi> O the rebellious <hi>Generall Lyſias,</hi> that would be ſo bold as to take him out of their hands! What a noiſe there is of <hi>this kind of violence,</hi> that your enemies in three Kingdomes ſay you have done unto them, that they cannot judge us <hi>according to their Law.</hi> This is the <hi>great miſchief</hi> that your <hi>Army</hi> hath done them, that they cannot <hi>judge</hi> your <hi>Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely (<hi>Right Honourable</hi>) if <hi>Tertullus</hi> had lived in theſe dayes, (I am ſorry I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended him for his wit) he might have <hi>ſtarved,</hi> for any <hi>imployment</hi> he could have had of the moſt <hi>ſtupid</hi> of <hi>Malignants</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> There is not the moſt <hi>blockiſh
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45816:52"/>
Malignant</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> but can plead better for himſelf. Do but obſerve his <hi>learned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> (well <hi>painted over</hi> with <hi>ſmooth words</hi>) and you will ſay he was an <hi>Aſſe,</hi> and went the ready way to <hi>betray</hi> his <hi>Clients,</hi> if <hi>Felix</hi> had not been <hi>Judge,</hi> and their better <hi>friend</hi> to keep <hi>Paul</hi> cloſe priſoner ſtill.</p>
            <p>Do but mark: <hi>Whom we took and would have judged</hi> (ſaith he, and we believe him) <hi>according to our law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let me preſſe you to note this <hi>paſſage. Tertullus</hi> plainly declares that he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt <hi>Paul</hi> for no other cauſe, but upon the grounds of hatred and revenge. How ſo? He ſhould have been judged according to their law. What was that? I pray read it in the foregoing Chap. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>Certain Jews made an aſſembly, and bound themſelves with a curſe, ſaying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</hi> The <hi>old murderer Satan</hi> had given them a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Array</hi> to kill <hi>him</hi>; and the Law was only this, They had ſworn and <hi>bound themſelves under a Curſe</hi> (ver. 12.) <hi>that they would ſoon diſpatch him</hi>; and there were at the leaſt fourty <hi>Malignants</hi> that had liſted themſelves to <hi>murder him.</hi> I know not what other Law they had againſt him, but this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45816:53"/>
was all the Commiſſion of <hi>Oyr</hi> and <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> that paſt the conſent of <hi>both Houſes,</hi> the <hi>chief Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> that they might kill him without any more diſpute, being the Embaſſador of Chriſt; as your enemies did that Embaſſador in <hi>Holland, for being your Meſſenger.</hi> For they had ſaid before, that <hi>Damn them they would do it</hi>; as they here had bound themſelves by oath to do the like feat. This was the <hi>Law</hi> they meant to try him by; and the <hi>fooliſh Orator</hi> could not <hi>conceal</hi> it, but tells <hi>Felix</hi> in plain terms that they had an intent to <hi>deſtroy</hi> him, if <hi>Lyſias</hi> had not reſcued him. It is very likely he would have had <hi>Felix</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand him in a better ſenſe, but that <hi>Lyſias</hi> Letter <hi>to the moſt excellent Governour Felix</hi> (as he ſtiles him) diſcovered their <hi>bloody purpoſe</hi> before; that he could not have him <hi>ſhot to death,</hi> nor <hi>ſentenced to die,</hi> while <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> was Judge.</p>
            <p>O the <hi>treachery</hi> of your <hi>Enemies</hi> in this <hi>powder-plot!</hi> and O the <hi>deep ſubtilty</hi> of your <hi>ſeeming Friends,</hi> in this horrid treaſon againſt your <hi>true Friends</hi>! It is better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by <hi>Interjections,</hi> then it can poſſibly be <hi>engraven in ſtone,</hi> or <hi>cut out in wood</hi>; the narrow <hi>compaſſe</hi> of <hi>words</hi> cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall crave only ſo much <hi>patience,</hi> as to put up <hi>Joſephs requeſt</hi> unto you; that ſeeing the <hi>Almighty providence</hi> hath reſtored unto you the Liberty that you deſired, and hath made you the <hi>Keepers and Diſtributers</hi> of the <hi>Liberties of England,</hi> and that you have the many <hi>Cluſters of Grapes</hi> in your hands; that you would be pleaſed to let ſome of the <hi>juice of thoſe Grapes</hi> drop into <hi>the Cup</hi> of your <hi>afflicted Joſephs. Remember him,</hi> and <hi>ſhew him mercy,</hi> I pray you, now that you are reſtored. And if ever you heare <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi> charging your friends, (as <hi>Ioſephs</hi> Miſtris did <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> becauſe he could not be tempted to commit <hi>folly</hi> with her) Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (I pray) ſtill, that it is <hi>Tertullus</hi> that pleads; not <hi>Tertullus</hi> the <hi>novice,</hi> the <hi>fool,</hi> but <hi>Tertullus</hi> the <hi>Barriſter,</hi> it may be <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus</hi> the <hi>Serjeant,</hi> the <hi>Iudge,</hi> the <hi>Committee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> the <hi>Commiſſioner.</hi> It is <hi>poſſible,</hi> I ſay, that ſuch a thing may be. I beſeech you, Sirs, ſuſpect ever, when you hear their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation blemiſhed, <hi>Is not the hand of Ioab
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45816:54"/>

If they would have you believe that your <hi>friends</hi> be not your <hi>friends,</hi> but they were <hi>ſelf-ended, vitious,</hi> your <hi>enemies</hi> in <hi>intention,</hi> though eminently <hi>faithful in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> Remember ſtill that it is <hi>Tertullus,</hi> or one or more for him. And what if theſe <hi>Inſtruments</hi> come hot from your <hi>Enemies forge?</hi> what if they have a <hi>dark Lanthorne</hi> too, and are <hi>underminers</hi> of your <hi>honour and ſafety?</hi> I beſeech you ſirs, ſuſpect this ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and caſt in your thoughts that ſuch a thing may be. You ſuſpect your <hi>meat</hi> ſometimes, and the <hi>ſafety of your perſons</hi> and <hi>houſes</hi>; and why not as well the very being of your <hi>Honour and Safety?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Do not love your enemies: but love them.</hi> I have heard many bleeding narrations, that the late <hi>Mulct</hi> ſo honourably intended by you to ſhame your <hi>Enemies</hi> into <hi>obedience,</hi> is become an unſpeakable <hi>ſnare</hi> and <hi>ſhame</hi> to your <hi>friends,</hi> for being <hi>Round-heads</hi>; and it lies upon them chiefly, and upon the <hi>leaſt</hi> of your <hi>enemies.</hi> Their ſubtilty hath (almoſt unavoidable) wayes to cleave and winde about your ſoundeſt trees, that like <hi>Ivy,</hi> will ſoon eat out the <hi>very heart</hi> of their <hi>integrity,</hi> if not carefully cut at the root, or at leaſt prevented in their <hi>windings</hi> about, becauſe

there is <hi>ſuch difficulty,</hi> if not <hi>impoſſibility</hi> to find out the root, as being ſo <hi>deep,</hi> and <hi>intricate</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> to be digged after; and <hi>coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and <hi>tickliſh,</hi> to diſcerne it from other <hi>roots</hi> like it; O the <hi>depths</hi> of ſubtilty!

            <p n="1">1. You have <hi>Commiſſion. GOD</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Moſes, Moſes</hi> again the <hi>Iſraelites; Execute vengeance</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>upon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites.</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:45816:65"/>
There's your <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> Why ſo? becauſe they drew <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin. This <hi>ſin</hi> brought down Gods <hi>judgments,</hi> and theſe <hi>judgments</hi> cut off <hi>thouſands.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>How many of the <hi>ſimpler</hi> ſort of this <hi>Nation</hi> have bin vexed in this kind, and have been drawn to <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>ignorance,</hi> and <hi>to beleeve as the Church beleeves</hi>? what miſchief hath this <hi>ungodly mixture</hi> wrought amongſt us?

            <p>Do but hold to theſe Rules, and it will prove a great addition to your reputation in <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Do violence to no man</hi>; Be not greedy of the <hi>pillage,</hi> nor of private revenge, becauſe the ſword is in thy hand: Forget that: It is below thee, now that thou art a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi> to retein <hi>ſuch things,</hi> and to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by <hi>paſſion</hi>; Let that be the work of <hi>Cowards,</hi> not of <hi>Souldiers.</hi> This will bring a very good repute upon your undertake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in City and Country, and make you <hi>honoured,</hi> as well as <hi>feared</hi> amongſt your Enemies.</p>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Be content with your Pay</hi>; and do not mutinie, but ſtay till it can be provided. Forbear to tell the Country-people, that all they have is yours, and that you won it by the ſword. You have indeed won much, and you have won their lands, and liberties, and lives from Tyrants; but it is for them, not for your ſelves.

            <p>And leſt my Exhortation (by preſſing it ſo earneſtly) ſhould leave the leaſt ſtain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>many</hi> that <hi>deſerve ſo well</hi> among you, in the ſtrict obſervance of theſe Orders: Take this juſt Teſtimony: Never did ſuch an Army diſarm ſo many <hi>Malignant tongues</hi> of <hi>words</hi> againſt you, as you have done, to your reputation; I could wiſh that all would <hi>write after your copy.</hi> Oh, how many <hi>Malignants</hi> would lie in heaps before you, either by <hi>admiring</hi> at you, or <hi>burſting</hi> by

            </p>
            <p>Thus you have all the <hi>Motives</hi> by way of <hi>Encouragement,</hi> as you can deſire, to adde <hi>life</hi> to your <hi>undertakings</hi> of this kind.</p>
            <p>And <hi>for direction.</hi> Though you, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned <hi>Commanders,</hi> have evidenced to the world ſo much <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>valour,</hi> that you need none of my <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> yet you will give me leave to <hi>drop</hi> theſe <hi>directions</hi> in your <hi>Camp,</hi> as tending not to <hi>mutiny,</hi> but <hi>obedience</hi>; and the rather becauſe ſome have made but little <hi>progreſſe</hi> in obſerving <hi>good orders,</hi> as yet; and I know you that act <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably,</hi> would have all (under you) act and go on upon the ſame Principles, and in their Order alſo.</p>
            <p>I know the carriage of ſuch as are <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi> and <hi>exorbitant,</hi> doth much offend you, and your <hi>proceedings</hi> againſt them; have ſhewed your <hi>diſlike</hi> and <hi>ſeverity</hi> againſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders of all kinds (puniſhable by you,) that come within your <hi>cogniſance</hi>; and me thinks the complaint that <hi>Jacob</hi> made of his two ſons <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> may be

            </p>
            <p>Such as theſe that act <hi>without Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and againſt <hi>Articles,</hi> do much diſhonour upon their Chieftains.</p>
            <p>I ſhall leave theſe directions and take poſt to a concluſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Be valiant.</hi> It was <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> charge to his <hi>Captains</hi> and <hi>Soldiers,</hi> 2 Chron. 32.7. <hi>Be ſtrong and of a good courage, feare not, nor be afraid of</hi> Aſhur; Aſhur is the enemy here in my text; and you have bloody <hi>Aſhur</hi> again in <hi>Ireland</hi>; you muſt not fear them: God tels you ſo: and you have been valiant.</p>
            <p>There be three <hi>ingredients</hi> that makes up <hi>Chriſtian-courage</hi> and <hi>Magnanimity,</hi> fit for your wearing. It is confeſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the Cauſe and quarrel in hand; the <hi>conſcience</hi> muſt be informed of the <hi>equity</hi> of it, as namely that it is for <hi>God</hi> &amp; the <hi>People of God,</hi> our wives, our ſons, our daughters, our friends; this makes men as bold as <hi>Lyons,</hi> to trample death; it was this
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:45816:69"/>
that ſet <hi>David</hi> upon <hi>Goliah, Luther</hi> upon <hi>Rome,</hi> and our honoured <hi>Cromwell</hi> upon <hi>Hamilton</hi> and <hi>Langdale</hi> in the North.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A Relying upon God</hi> for a gracious iſſue, when we go forth to fight the enemy, with this aſſurance, that not a <hi>hair will fall from our heads,</hi> without the All-ordering providence; O this helps on very well.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>A ſerious acknowledgement</hi> that the iſſues of war are in <hi>Gods</hi> hand; as the Battell is his, ſo is the <hi>Honour</hi> his too, and it is all one with him to ſave with many or with few: O this is the very <hi>ſteelen-back</hi> of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian courage</hi>; tell not me ſaith the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, what be their <hi>high words</hi>? what care <hi>I</hi> for <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> and a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred more? Let <hi>Scott,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> come with thouſands, I care not, The <hi>field</hi> is my <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> and the iſſue of war is his, and it is all one with him to ſave with many as with few.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Get and uſe honeſt craft; the enemy is ſubtile, and he ſerves a <hi>cunning-maſter</hi>; out-vie him too in point of <hi>policie; Chriſt</hi> commands it, <hi>Be wiſe as Serpents,</hi> nay, and blames thoſe of his own that are not ſo, <hi>The children of this Generation are wiſer then the children of light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:45816:69"/>I will give you but one example. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> intending to recover his nephew <hi>Lot</hi> out of their hands that had taken him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive, did not fight them in the field, but wiſely divided his company <hi>&amp;</hi> ſmore them by night. But yet <hi>for all your wiſedome,</hi> you muſt be faithful &amp; uſe <hi>honeſt craft,</hi> &amp; keep promiſe with the Enemy: and though they prove baſe that way to us, we muſt not do ſo to them; we muſt not promiſe to <hi>ſave</hi> them, and then <hi>deſtroy</hi> them; we muſt not agree to receive them to <hi>protection</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then work their <hi>confuſion</hi>; that's treachery, not craft.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Be religious</hi>; Do not raile againſt and revile <hi>Religious men.</hi> It were well if many of you had humility with your zeal, and would bridle your tongues when you ſpeak of thoſe many <hi>godly men</hi> that jump not with your opinions in every thing.</p>
            <p>The ſaying was, <hi>inter arma ſilent leges.</hi> Though others take the liberty to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe all <hi>lawes</hi> and <hi>rules</hi> of Chriſtian cariage and common civility, in <hi>unſavoury words</hi> and <hi>rude actions</hi>; yet you are taught better things. Civility is a common grace, very comely to behave your ſelves with towards an <hi>enemy,</hi> much more towards your <hi>friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:45816:70"/>I am ſorry I am taken off, that I cannot at preſent <hi>enlarge</hi> my mind to you. I muſt ſet a <hi>period,</hi> and yield unto the <hi>birth,</hi> though it come before the time. Good <hi>Reader,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the more of thy <hi>labour of love</hi> in <hi>cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> it: God may give <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe his aſſiſtance to the <hi>parent</hi> to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to it, if thou preſerve it in the mean time, till ſome preſent <hi>weakneſſes</hi> and <hi>diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> be over.</p>
