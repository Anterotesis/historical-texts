            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Which if we doe in a play, whereof the matter is many times but inuented, and howſoeuer it be true, yet happened in Countries farre off and long agoe, the parties neither touching vs in kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, nor the matter in example: ſurely the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous practices and moſt horrible executions of the <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition,</hi> declared in this booke, which now is brought with fire and ſword into the low Countries, the ſodaine impriſonment of honeſt men without proceſſe of law, the pitifull wandring in exile and pouertie of perſonages ſomtime rich and wealthy, the wiues hanging on their husbands
<pb facs="tcp:17938:6"/>
ſhoulders, and the poore baniſhed infants on the mothers breſts, the monſtrous racking of men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order of law, the villanous and ſhameleſſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting of naked women beyond all humanitie, their miſerable death without pitty or mercy, the moſt reprochfull triumphing of the popiſh Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue ouer Chriſtians, as over Painimes and Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks, the conquering of ſubiects as though they were enemies, the vnſatiable ſpoyling of mens goods, to fill the ſide paunches of ambitious idle ſhauelings, the ſlender quarrels picked againſt king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and nations, and all this onely to hoiſe vp a pild polling prieſt aboue all power and authoritie that is on earth: theſe things ought ſurely much more to moue vs to compaſsion: Being no ſtage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play, but a matter fit for any Poet to make a Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of hereafter, either for that it will bee an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moſt lamentable, or moſt incredible to them which ſhall not haue ſeene it; The perſons which ſuffer being our neighbours by their habitation and dwelling place, our acquaintance by entercourſe, our friends by long acquaintance, of the ſame houſhold of faith, and our very brethren in Chriſt. And if we weepe when we ſee cruelties ſet forth in playes, becauſe the like either hath happened to vs heretofore, or hereafter may betide vs, then have we not ouely good cauſe in theſe calamities of our poore brethren to bewaile that which happened to them, but alſo to feare what will follow vpon vs. For if we, that not many yeares ſince felt but a taſte of this Iron whippe, and ſince haue enioyed quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

If the Diuels holineſſe, and his lieutenant generall, the Popes maieſtie, were a little moued then, they bee now (doubt ye not) enraged, and tranſubſtantiate into furour and horne woodneſſe, to ſee their reuenues decay, their Monaſteries and Synagogues defaced, their villanies detected, their noble champions ſlain.

(good Reader) vnderſtand the world, theſe men ſeeke no religion. For how can they ſeeke Religion, that thinke there is no God? They ſeeke the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and wealth of the world.

to yeare, ſhould erre from the truth, or doe any thing againſt right or conſcience: ſpecially being neither the firſt authors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, nor maintaining it as a thing newly deuiſed, or without any certaine originall, but as that, which being receiued from their forefathers, and reuerenced both for the opinion of holineſſe and countenance of antiquitie, hath by a power greater then is the power of man, beene esteemed here among men as a heauenly thing. Beſides theſe glorious titles, there be alſo thereunto annexed other ſingular commodities; to wit, a diligent endeuour to remoue the infection that might grow aſwell of the Iewiſh and Mahometicall hereſies that daily doe ariſe, beſides the reuenues of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer encreaſed hereby, and the ſodaine and maruelous enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of diuers priuate perſons, which though they be great matters in worldly reſpect, yet are they not ſo greatly to be accompted of in this cauſe. But foraſmuch as by Chriſts owne ſaying, and by naturall reaſon, a man cannot haue a more eaſie or perfect iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the qualitie of a tree, whether it be good or bad, then by the fruit thereof, I may without offending of any man in the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of this matter, which is no leſſe profitable then hard and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to doe, obſerue the ſame order: ſince the miſchiefe is now already ſo farre detected, and men growne to be ſo curious, that they feare not to call into question ſuch things, as they haue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto by great errour and doltiſhneſſe worſhipped and held for moſt holy and ſacred. Now if the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> be a good tree, or as they delight to terme it a <hi>Holy,</hi> I doubt not but it will be content to ſhew the fruits openly, by the goodneſſe or holineſſe whereof, it may without fraud or enuie be eſteemed how good or holy the ſtocke it ſelfe is. For light loueth the light, and he that dealeth truly and vprightly is willing to come into the light, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight of the diuell and all other darkneſſe, that his workes done in the feare of God may come to light. But he that worketh the things that be euill hateth the light, and hauing power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, bridleth mens tongues, couering his faults with forced ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, leſt that the light ſhould diſcouer them, and ſhew them to be repro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:17938:10"/>
fruites of the <hi>Holy Inquiſition:</hi> which being otherwiſe very plentifull, by the onely meanes of Gods goodneſſe, wee haue here and there plucked for a ſay and taste of the tree, and by theſe let them iudge (as caſily they may) whether this Holy Tree be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſtand ſtill, or to be turned vpſide downe. For herein resteth all and ſome concerning theſe matters; whether the reports that I ſhall make in this Treatiſe of the <hi>Holy Inquiſition,</hi> be true or no. Secondarily, how I came to the knowledge thereof, for no man will doubt but that this tree doth worthily deſerue to bee hewed downe, if there be ſufficient proofe that it buddeth forth ſuch pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent bloſſomes, and beareth like fruites as theſe be. Againe, it were a dangerous and inconuenient matter, if we heretickes that deteſt the Inquiſition as a ſharpe and iuſt plague of God, and therefore worthy to be holden ſuſpected, ſhould haue any credite giuen vs herein. Wherefore I haue thought it a thing worthy the trauaile, to ſhew the briefeſt and moſt certaine way, whereby the truth thereof might without any great trouble be vnderſtood. That is to ſay, if the King whoſe office it is ſpecially to ſee to the adminiſtration of justice in his owne dominion, would first bee brought to beleeue, that both he might of his abſolute authoritie, and of dutie ought to call the holy Court of <hi>Inquiſition</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, and that no lawes or decrees of their making, no Priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, no Bulls, no Pardons or diſpenſations, finally, no Oath ought to let or hinder him from the doing of his dutie herein. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily, if after he had appointed ſuch a ſpeciall Commiſſion to examine the Inquiſition, he would ſeeke meanes to be enſormed of ſuch matters by men of grauitie and good conſciences, who cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnto them others, ſuch as might be thought to haue the most knowledge and beſt experience in theſe matters, might learne out a truth, as the beſt custome is, in all other courts and conſiſtories as they call them. For the which purpoſes thoſe that either preſently are, or haue beene heretofore fettered in the Inquiſitours priſons, were firſt to bee ſent for and examined but vnbridled in any caſe, hauing thoſe worſe then Iron bittes, taken from their tongues, with the which the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> hath hitherto kept her tyrannie
<pb facs="tcp:17938:11"/>
cloſe; that is to ſay, their ſolemne ſwearing of them to be ſilent while they liue, inhibiting them the vttering of any thing by any meanes, that they either knew, or ſaw, or had experience of themſelues touching the <hi>Holy Inquiſition,</hi> or their whole manner of proceeding againſt them in Court or otherwiſe: but that they ſhould rather repute themſelues as dead perſons for for that time concerning the knowledge or ſenſe of any ſuch matters. And as though their oath (for ſooth) were not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of force enough, they annexe thereunto terrible threatnings. By meanes where of all the trickes of the Inquiſition haue hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beene ſecret and hidden, and paſſed vnder couert to and fro, with a cloake and ſhadow of a zeale of godlineſſe, and yet not ſo obſcurely or ſecretly, but that the whole world (though confuſedly and as it were a farre off) hath at the length eſpied and found out their outragious tyranny.</p>
            <p>And this is the onely cauſe that maketh all men keepe their tongues, leaſt it might bee their happes likewiſe to haue experience thereof in themſelues. This bridle I ſay muſt firſt bee remoued and taken away from them of whome theſe queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould be asked, and libertie muſt be giuen to ſpeake boldly and without danger, if a man would haue theſe ſecrecies come to light, that haue beene kept cloſe ſo long, to the great decay and hinderance of the Common wealth, Wherefore if ſmall credite ſhall be giuen to vs in this Treatiſe, or none at all, becauſe wee be as it were a partie, and therefore juſtly to be ſuſpected, ſeeing for our owne parts wee deſire no credite, but referre the matter whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diligent and orderly triall, there is no cauſe why any ſhould thinke better or worſe of it for vs, but judge of it indifferently by it ſelfe as it is.</p>
            <p>Moreouer it is as greatly pertinent to our purpoſe to ſhew how we came to the knowledge hereof. Wherein, albeit we take God to record and our conſcience, that all this is true, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding wee craue no ſuch credite to be aided thereby: neither ſhall any have juſt cauſe to lay that to our charge, that we haue gone from the triall of the matter, and vſed this as a ſhift.</p>

            <p>After the warres were ended, wherin <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Iſabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> of famous memory expelled the Turkes out of the territory and Citie of <hi>Granata,</hi> and other places in <hi>Spaine,</hi> which had vſurped there by the ſpace of 778. yeares, from the time of <hi>Roderico</hi> the laſt king of <hi>Spain,</hi> that was of the race and line of the <hi>Goths,</hi> hauing reſtored their country into the ancient eſtate that it was in before, and gotten to themſelues perpetuall fame and renowne, they fell from thoſe continuall troubles and tumults of warre to

reforming and purging of religion. The occaſion whereof came as well by the <hi>Mores,</hi> that being conquered, had liberty to remaine in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and enjoy all their goods with condition that they ſhould receiue the chriſtian faith: as by the Iewes, that were in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as many as the other, who were permitted to continue ſtill vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame condition that the <hi>Mores</hi> did, commandement being giuen to all that were not content to admit this condition, that they ſhould immediately depart <hi>Spaine,</hi> paſsing ouer the ſtraites of <hi>Marrocke,</hi> and retyre into their owne countrey. For the <hi>Iewes</hi> (as their most ancient Chronicles doe report) did inhabite <hi>Spaine</hi> from the time that <hi>Titus</hi> Emperor of <hi>Rome</hi> deſtroyed <hi>Ierulalem.</hi> Who cauſed them to bee tranſported thither, there to remaine in miſerie and thraldome, being notwithstanding in good caſe for one thing, in that they were not compelled by any to alter their religion till the time of <hi>Ferdinando.</hi> Whereupon the kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> conſidering, that thoſe people were but only Chriſtians by name and for faſhion ſake, ſubmitting themſelues for feare and awe, and for ſafegard of their riches, rather then any loue or zeal which they bare to christianitie, deuiſed to make prouiſion, and to take ſome order for their better instruction.

And the court of Inquiſition being erected on the other part for reformation of errours, they might be ſure like good hunters to lodge the Deere, and take their ſtand, and ſo to obtaine a continuall prey. But to proceed, let vs grant them thus much, that the Inquiſition was ordained to none other end, and that they be two ſeuerall and diſtinct offices, to teach the faith, and to roote out hereſies, yet were it the part and dutie of good and diſcreet counſellours, to prouide that the authoritie committed to Biſhops by the holy Scriptures of God, ſhould not thereby be taken from them: neither ſhould any other perſwaſion
<pb facs="tcp:17938:15"/>
enter into their heads, that there were any other fire or ſword to root out hereſies, but only the ſword of Gods word: both the which things the holy Apoſtle did moſt euidently teach in the Epiſtle to <hi>Titus;</hi> where among other qualities required in a Biſhop, hee would haue him embrace the word of God fit for inſtruction, that he may be able to exhort by wholeſome doctrine, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the gainſayers and aduerſaries. For ſurely a true and iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith cannot be forced, (the nature thereof is ſuch) no more can hereſie be deſtroyed by the heretickes death. But the word of God is moſt apt and ſit for both purpoſes. For thereby faith is not only engendred, but increaſed and multiplyed meruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, and whatſoeuer is not agreeable to true faith, if it be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined and tried by the light of this word, ſhall ſoone be bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Wherefore they ought first to haue reſorted to the Scriptures, and taken counſell of them, whether they had limited any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſuch as ſhould ſhew themſelues wilfull and obſtinate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the truth, or the moſt cruell execution that can be by fire. For as concerning the confiſcation of goods, what can be thought more wretched and couetous, or more vnjuſt and ſhameleſſe, or further from the profeſſion of a Christian man? And to let paſſe their open infamy, the staine whereof will hardly be ſpunged out againe, who can worthily ſpeake enough againſt them, that vſe the ſame kinde of puniſhment euen againſt thoſe poore wretches, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> they haue perſwaded to recant their errours? <hi>Paul</hi> in the place aboue mentioned, appointeth no penaltie, for as much as it may well be, that the partie condemned may in time be reclaimed, and therefore mercy ought rather to be practiſed of euery good ſhepheard with all gentleneſſe and loue, then any ſuch extremitie. But let vs enter further, and ſee what <hi>Paul</hi> appointeth for ſuch as are obstinate perſons. Auoide the company of an hereticke (ſaith he) after one or two admonitions. Firſt hee would haue him charitably admoniſhed of his error twice or thrice, and that by the Biſhop, not cited into the court, not put to the torments, or otherwiſe puniſhed for his erronious opinions with ſuch extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ſo continually. Then if gentle admonition will reclaime
<pb facs="tcp:17938:15"/>
him, there is good cauſe why both the Biſhop and the whole congregation may rejoyce of the winning of a brother, to be a member of Chriſt. But if ſuch admonitions will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, he counſelleth vs to proceed to excommunication: that is to ſay, to cut him off and exclude him the company and fellowſhip of the Chriſtians: the which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding must not be executed in way of reuenge of his error, but ministred as a medicine for his amendment. And this judgement of the Diſciple agreeth with the rule of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: <hi>If hee wil not giue ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to thee, nor other</hi> (ſaith he) that is to ſay, them that haue giuen him admonition the ſecond time, <hi>Let him be thence forth accompted of as an Ethnicke or Publican.</hi> Which is as much in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, as if he had neuer receiued the faith. In this degree of ſeueritie, which being duely conſidered is ſharpe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, Chriſts diſcipline ſtayeth, and proceedeth no further. And this is the Court, theſe be the lawes thereof, and the whole manner of proceeding, wherewith a true Chriſtian man (if there had beene any ſuch among them) ſhould haue contented himſelfe in proceeding againſt his brother being beſide the right way; or againſt any hereſies, of what ſort or condition ſoeuer they be, becauſe Chriſt hath thought them to be ſufficient, and prouided theſe remedies, which the Church hath alwayes vſed from time to time to great profite, in the rooting vp of all hereſies that at any time grew therein. As concerning the putting of heretickes to death, it is like altogether, as if a Phiſician, to the intent to rid the patient of his diſeaſe, ſhould for the nonce rid him alſo of his life. Moreouer, they that doe pretend most of all now adayes the rooting vp of hereſies by ſuch meanes, do not only not attaine thereunto, (for as yet the world is blinded, to take falſhood for truth) but if it were ſo, then by taking away his life, they cut him off from all thoſe meanes and poſſibilities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might attaine his owne ſaluation. For it might very well come to paſſe in time, for aſmuch as Gods judgements
<pb facs="tcp:17938:16"/>
are deepe and incomprehenſible, that the partie continuing aliue, might bee brought into ſome better caſe. But it is to be feared will ſome ſay, leſt he infect others. True it is, and for that conſideration both Chriſt and his Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth us to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſchue him, and to cut him off from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Church. But if they would needes proceede far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and vpon other reaſonable conſiderations puniſh ſuch obstinate perſons more ſeuerely; were not the ordinary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate ſufficient to execute the ſame? Doubtleſſe their anſwer will bee this, that the knowledge of hereſies, can in no caſe appertaine to the ſecular magistrates, becauſe they for the most part are ignorant in the holy Scriptures and Eccleſiaſticall affaires: For this is a common ſaying with theſe Fathers that are ſo far ſeen in Gods ſecrets, that neither the knowledge nor determination of matters in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doe appertaine to the <hi>Secular</hi> magistrate, as they terme him in deſpight and reproach But I pray you in what reſpect are they themſelues choſen to ſupply thoſe places, and to bee Inquiſitours to determine matters of faith, whereof they are termed the Fathers, or to diſcuſſe hereſies, whereof they are ſaid to ridde the world, being neither learned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor able to teach the beliefe? For they are thought men good enough for that office if they be Doctors in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and canon lawes. As for their Diuines (and yet a ſilly diuinitie God knowes) truly ſince the time that the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> were diſplaced thence, (wherof I made mention before) we haue not ſeen any of them execute any ſuch office. Yea, what if ſince that time there hath bin an order taken by the Inquiſitors, and entred into their books, that no Diuine thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth ſhould occupy any ſuch place? Now as concerning the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil law, ſurely the Inquiſitors do not excell the ſecular magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate; and as for the canon, if a man were neuer ſo well ſeen in it, they cannot deny, but it ſerueth as little to the deciding of matters in religion as the ciuill. How then is it poſsible to be otherwiſe, but that when ſuch ignorant men bee admitted
<pb facs="tcp:17938:16"/>
to determine matters of Religion, as haue no manner of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the holy Scriptures, ſaue only a little poore skill in the conſtitutions of mans braine, they muſt needs turne ſweet into ſoure, and ſoure into ſweet: call light darkeneſſe, and darkeneſſe light? That is to ſay, in profeſſing themſelues to bee the Patrones of ſaith, roote out all faith, and maintaine monſtrous errours: ſlea the children of God, and cheriſh the children of the diuell: kill the ſeruants of Chriſt, foster, maintaine, and encreaſe the ſeruants of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</p>
            <p>Here they will anſwer vs, that albeit they themſelues can no more judge of matters touching faith, than a blinde man can of colours, yet they take into counſell and commiſſion with them, to debate ſuch matters, divers Diuines, whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript rule and order they put in execution, ſpecially <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicanes,</hi> who haue nothing now to doe with the high autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and commiſſion of <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> ſaue only that they are admitted to conſultations, and to the <hi>Qualifications of doctrine,</hi> as they terme it.</p>
            <p>And here though we examine not narrowly with what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Diuinitie they come furniſhed to this office, yet we may eaſily gheſſe, that being remoued for the cauſes aforeſaid, and thought vnſit for the place, they are not ſince growne much more apt: ſpecially ſeeing beſides their old infirmities, they are grieuouſly ſicke of their ancient ſhame; daily renewed by beholding from a low place, the loftie Tribunall ſeat from whence they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſmounted, and are in a perpetuall headach and madneſſe of jealous men, to ſee their aduerſaries enioy the honour which they haue lost. Wherein we report vs to the Inquiſitours themſelues, for no manknoweth better then they, what tokens the poore <hi>Dominicanes</hi> giue outwardly of the great bile within their breſt full of malitious matter, as oft as they are called to thoſe graue and waightie deliberations: in-ſo-much that it hath perhaps beene thought on, to ſhut them quite out of the Inquiſitours doores.
<pb facs="tcp:17938:17"/>
But goe to, they are peradventure amended ſince. Why might not then the ordinary magiſtrate call the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines to the ſame conſultations? Now to appoint any man iudge of matters which hee vnderſtandeth not, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he muſt needs hang altogether of other mens opinions and ſentences whatſoeuer they bee, what an iniquitie is this? What a peruerting of all law and iuſtice?

            <p>It happened a few yeares paſſed, in <hi>Barchinon</hi> a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Citie in the teritory of <hi>Cathalonia,</hi> that when they ſhould march forward in their proceſsion on <hi>corpus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſti</hi> day to carry the Maſſe bread about, and all things were ready, requiſite to ſo ſolemne a ſhew, euen as the Prieſt that had danced the Tragicall high Maſſe, ſhould couch the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hoſt in the golden pixe, as the Diuell would haue it, it was too great a compaſſe to be put in the boxe. All men were amaſed: the whole ſhew ſtaied: there was not a man in that great and notable aſſembly that knew what to doe, in a caſe ſo ſtrange and ſo vnlocked for. Now ſurely it was a ſport alone, and a ieſt worthy ſo great a company.</p>
            <p>Some perhaps of the wiſer ſort, ſaw no way but one to help at a pinch; namely to begin a new Maſſe in Gods name and with better lucke, and to ſhape a cake fit for the boxe. But that was too late: for the proceſsion had farre to goe, and it was too too much paines to defer it any longer. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, perchance there was neuer a ſir Iohn there but had broke his faſt well, the better to take paine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in ſo great a ſolemnity. And tho the Diuines were of opinion that hee that
<pb facs="tcp:17938:17"/>
ſang the high Maſſe, might diſpatch another in caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, yet he good ſoule looking for nothing leſſe then ſuch a chance, had already ſupt vp the rinſing of the Chalice, as his dutie was to doe. Well ſir, there was one of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, a man of <hi>Arragon,</hi> whoſe name was <hi>Molonio.</hi> This Gentleman being as haſtie by nature, as bold by authoritie, made no more adoe, but tooke a paire of ciſſours, and pared his maker where he was ouergrowne, and ſo by a little paring, put both him in the boxe, and the people out of doubt. Some perhaps will praiſe this mans preſent wit in ſo great a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie: others will abhorre and deteſt his godleſſe and raſh boldneſſe: others will bewaile and lament the hard fortune of their God ſo to be pared and circumciſed by the curſed hands of a cruell Inquiſitour. But good Lord, if any other had beene ſo ſaucie but an Inquiſitor, ſpecially if he had had any Iewes blood in him, how would they haue handled him trow you? Indeed <hi>Molonio</hi> was put out of office: but he tarried not many dayes ere he was ſent to be Inquiſitour at <hi>Siuil,</hi> for they might not loſe ſo ſtout a ſouldier of the Inquiſition for a trifle. What ſhould we here talke of the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie? they extoll and abaſe him: they adore him and contemn him: they reuenge his wrong and doe him wrong, euen as hee ſerueth or hindreth their holy office. Wee purpoſe not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute theſe matters any further, meaning only to touch them in way of Preface, to declare by what beginnings and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> is growne: what antiquitie and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it carryeth: and what profite it hath brought to the world vnder the title of reforming religion. Theſe things being as we haue declared them, ſo true in deed, and ſuch in qualitie, as no honeſt man can either plainely denie them, or juſtly excuſe them, no man ought to maruell if the people, which haue otherwiſe hitherto beene moſt dutifully obedient to their Magiſtrates, to driue ſo horrible a peſtilence from their countrie, haue be taken themſelues to their weapons and defence of armes, as hauing none other more reaſonable

            <p>They protest, that they ſeeke not to auoide the reformation of religion, which they heartily wiſh for, ſo that it be ſuch a one as is worthy of ſo good a name, and bee directed by the preſcript word of God, which ought to be the onely rule of religion, to all that loue true religion. And in that behalfe, what can they hope for of the Inquiſition, beſides that it hath already yeelded? They protest further, that they owe to their lawfull gouernours, and that by the expreſſe word of God, obedience, honour, and tribute, the which they are moſt ready to performe with their accuſtomed chearefulneſſe and hearty good will. Only they humbly pray and beſeech, that it may be taken of them without the diſhonour of God, and the most miſerable capti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>itie and thraldome of their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the which ought to bee more recommended, and deare to good and godly men, then their very liues. They protest beſides, that they will not any manner of wayes ſhake off the yoake of juſt obedience to their Magiſtrates, but they complaine, (and that not without great cauſe) that beſides the eaſie and gentle yoke which they haue hitherto borne with that meekeneſſe of heart that became them, they are ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the Iron whips of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> which ſeeketh nothing but the ſlaughter of innocent Citizens, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation and ſpoile of their goods. They might haue in times paſt with ſome colour blamed the men of <hi>Arragon,</hi> which receiued not the Inquiſition without tumult and bloudſhed, for it was then couered with that goodly and freſh name, and ſhew of holineſſe: neither as yet had it raged against all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, but only against the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Moores,</hi> and that alſo for very plauſible and apparant cauſes. But now ſince it hath not ceaſed to bring forth ſuch fruites, as wee haue rehearſed for theſe threeſcore and fifteene yeares: I thinke they ſhall not ſeeme to be madde, that ſeeke by all meanes to them poſſible, to driue it from their borders. Nay, they might rather be truly judged to bee madde men,
<pb facs="tcp:17938:18"/>
if in ſtead of their faithfull fathers, and good ſhepheards and preachers of true religion they would wittingly and willingly receiue into their houſes the very enemies, and moſt cruell deſtroyers of all faith and religion. And if there be any that know them not to bee ſuch as wee terme them, let them read but part of their ſleights and manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings diſcouered in this booke, (for wee could not learne them all,) and let them well waigh and conſider them, and then judge.</p>

Firſt, they ſuborne ſome one out of a number, ſuch as have learned their leſſons for the nonce (commonly called <hi>Familiars)</hi> who of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <note place="margin">The Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars.</note> ſhall caſt himſelfe to meet one, and being proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded afore hand what to ſay, ſhall greet him on this wiſe. Sir, yeſterday, it was my chance to bee with my Lords the Inquiſitors, and as they happened to have ſpeech of you, they ſaid they had to talke with you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout certain of their affaires, and therfore gaue me in charge to ſummon you to appeare before them to morrow at ſuch an hour. Now the party may not (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once warned) either refuſe or differre to come, but at his very great perill. Whereupon the next day hee repaireth to the place where the Commiſsioners ſit, and requireth the porter to ſignifie vnto the Lords that he is come. Whereof as ſoon as they haue intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, all three (if they be preſent) or at leaſt two of them, meet in a Counſell chamber where the Court is commonly kept, as at <hi>Siuil;</hi> in the caſtle <hi>Triana,</hi> and

Then inquire they his name; and that knowne, what he would: for as for vs (ſay they) we wot not whether you be the ſame man that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be here with vs, yea or no. Marry now ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens you are come, if you have any thing to enforme vs of in this holy Court either of your ſelfe or of any other, in diſcharge of your conſcience (man) let vs hear it. Wherunto the party either anſwereth that he hath no ſuch matters to enforme them of (as indeed to ſtand vpon that point to the end with them, who ſeeke nothing els but his vndoing and ſuch as he ſhall appeach; is the wiſeſt &amp; ſafeſt way that may be taken) or els of meere ſimplicity, not knowing how he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangleth himſelfe, raſhly &amp; vnaduiſedly vttereth ſome thing of himſelfe or of ſome other. Then my Lords the Inquiſitors glad that they haue caught him, to the intent the more eaſily to fear and amaſe him that thus fooliſhly hath made himſelfe ſo fit a morſell for them to prey vpon, caſt lookes one at another, and reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing as though they had ſmelled the rat, all at once fix their eyes vpon him, and behold him earneſtly: and whiſpering together a little while (Iwot not whether they ſay ought or nought) at the laſt either award the party to priſon, if the matter that he diſcloſeth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſeem any thing waighty, or if he chance to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe nothing at all, they will him to depart, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that they know not, without better informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether hee bee the ſame party whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to come before them or no. Whilſt the party is thus in examination, prouiſion is made that the promoter who gaue information againſt him, is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly hidden behind ſome tapiſtry, where hee cannot
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17938:20"/>
be ſeen; yet ſo, as he may ſee the parties face, and know if it be the ſame man, or no, if haply the Inquiſitors know him not. Then licence they him to depart, being aſſured that it is he which ſhall miniſter matter for this tragedy, and perhaps call him not before them of 2. or 3. moneths after, ſpecially if he be there inhabitant: for if he be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiner, they lightly giue him not ſo great reſpit. The next time, when their pleaſure is to ſend for him, they exhort him againe, that if he know or haue heard any thing that concerneth their holy Court, to diſcloſe it vnto them. For we know right well (ſay they) that you haue dealt with certain perſons ſuſpected in religion; which if you will confeſſe of your own accord, aſſure your ſelfe you ſhall receiue no harme: therefore we charge you take heed and looke well to your ſelfe. Our opinion is of you, that like a good Chriſtian man, you will call to your remembrance ſuch things as are by-paſt: for indeed a mans memory is weak (we wot well) and may fail him, and therfore it may be you haue forgotten, and faine would tell all you know if you could call it to mind. By theſe and ſuch like ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they abuſe many ſilly ſoules, or els diſmiſſe them for that time: yet ſo, as they ſhall not think themſelues cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcharged; but to keep them continually occupied and vnquieted in their minds, and to make them ſtand in dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear &amp; awe of them, tell them it may be they ſhall haue further matter againſt them, and occaſion to call them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Yet ſometime it hapneth that they beare with ſome perſon, and winke at him many dayes, and with ſome whole yeares, ere they cauſe him to be apprehended, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes prouided, that he ſhall haue one or other of theſe iolly mates to keepe him company whereſoeuer he go, and waite vpon him at an inch to creepe into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and grope his conſcience: who vnder the colour of friendſhip and familiarity, very craftily and ſubtilly, whilſt he good man thinkes no harme, ſhall daily come and viſite him, and haue an eye to all his doings, &amp; mark
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17938:21"/>
with whom he conferreth, where hee vſeth to reſort, what he doth there, and, as nigh as may be, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts he goeth and what he intendeth: in ſo much that without the ſpeciall ayde of Gods holy proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it is not poſſible for a man to eſcape their ſnares. Now if any of the Inquiſitors chance to meet any ſuch perſons ſo diſmiſſed, they ſalute him very courteouſly, and ſhew him a good countenance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to ſtand his good friend. All which courteous kind of entertainement tendeth to none other end but to make the man more careleſſe of his eſtate, and ſo to vndoe him ere he be aware. But what good (I pray you) can they getby get by theſe deteſtable and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſleights, except perhaps they vſe them for their recreation, and take like pleaſure in them as doth the fouler in his paſtime, when hee playeth and dallieth with his game: or the fiſher, who after he hath ſtricken the fiſh, ſuffreth her to play with the line, and to ſport her ſelfe for a time that will ſcarfely laſt the turning of her taile: or as the catte that playeth with the mouſe, after ſhe hath giuen him ſome priuy pinch, leaving him at large, and hunting him afreſh, and by and by teareth him with her teeth, and eateth vp eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morſell? Wherein it may be that ſome ſecret myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lies hid, which all the world perceiues not, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together without gain to theſe holy Officers. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit this kind of dallying with their prey, they vſe not with euery body alike, in ſuch ſort as is before declared. For they haue very great reſpect of perſons and cauſes in this behalf. Which is a plain token that they deal not in this ſort either with ſuch ſtrangers or town-dwellers as they thinke are like to eſcape from them by this liberty, neither yet with ſuch as are char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with great matters, whom they thinke needfull to be ſeen vnto betimes, ſpecially if there be any hope that by their confeſſion they ſhall haue intelligence of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17938:21"/>
any other. But firſt, when they are determined to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any perſon that is accuſed, they vſe to ſend for the Biſhops deputy of that dioceſſe or Ordinary (as they call him) and making him priuy to the depoſitions of the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt the party accuſed (which they call an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) after a little conſultation had with him of the matter, they all ſubſcribe to a writing, which is a warrant directed from them to attach him: which kind of dealing ſeemeth to haue a ſhew of good equity. Forſooth they wil not bee thought to touch any of another mans flocke without th'aduiſe &amp; conſent of his own Paſtor, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full ignorant &amp; vnskilfull (God knows) in the duty of a Paſtor (as commonly all of that coat vnder Papacy are) is brought to giue his conſent, that the ſheep ouer whom he hath a ſpeciall charge, ſhall firſt be fleeced, &amp; afterward miſerably ſlain, &amp; bereft of goods &amp; life. For as yet there hath neuer any breach bin heard of about theſe matters betwixt the Inquiſitors and the Ordinary for defending any of his flocke that hath been by them ſent to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet may a man ſee ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times, yea daily almoſt, great numbers dy in priſon, ſome hunger-ſteru'd, ſome extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly racked and diſmembred in euery ioynt of their bodies, ſome euen in the midſt of their torments yeelding vp the Ghoſt betwixt the tormentors hands (as I will not faile hereafter to declare, when I ſhall be occaſioned to treate therof more conueniently) inſomuch that the Inquiſitors wil ſay of ſome of them, that they were as harmleſſe men, and as innocent, and put to death as wrongfully as any men could be. Wherby it is euident, that this ſending for the Ordinary to confer withall, about the apprehending of ſome vnder his cure, is a very vaine thing, and rather a fooliſh ceremony, than a matter ſerious or done of any iuſtice. And to tell the plaine truth, their manner is to bid the Ordinary to a banquet to quaffe his part of the <note place="margin">Banquet.</note> blood of his owne ſheepe, that the wolues may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the faſter friends. Our Lord Chriſt, the great ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of the ſheepe, come when hee ſeeth his time,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17938:22"/>
and render to each of them according to their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. Yet ſometimes it hapneth, that they call not the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to counſell, before the party be both accuſed and apprehended. For being well aſſured that hee will not gainſay them, nor controule any of their doings, they thinke it enough when the party is faſt &amp; forthcomming, then to declare to the Ordinary the occaſion and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their proceedings: who hearing it read vnto him, liketh very well thereof, aſwell that they haue already done, as is alſo content with whatſoeuer els they can deuiſe to do. Now if any that is accuſed doe chance to make an eſcape, either before he be apprehended or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then vſe they all deuices that may be to find him and fetch him againe. Neither is it ſufficient that they giue the ſearchers certain common ſigns and tokens to know him by, as to deſcribe his apparell, his countenance, age, &amp;c. but they draw his counterfaite as liuely as may be in <note place="margin">Counterfaits</note> ſundry patternes, and diſtribute them among the ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, to know the party the more eaſily by, whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they neuer ſaw in all their liues: whereof I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port you a true tale for example.</p>
               <p>Not long agone they apprehended a certain Italian at <hi>Siuil,</hi> who had wounded one of the Paratours on a time being at Rome, commonly called the Inquiſitors <hi>Algua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil.</hi> And albeit the Familiars that were ſent to ſeeke him, <note place="margin">The Algua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil is in manner of a Sheriffe.</note> had his counterfaite about them, as they vſe to haue: yet notwithſtanding hapning vpon him at <hi>Siuil,</hi> and halfe in doubt whether it were he or no, becauſe hee had altered his apparell, and of purpoſe changed his name, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him a good while onely of a bare ſuſpicion, which they had by his countenance that it ſhould be he. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one day as he was walking and talking with diuers in the Cathedral Church at <hi>Siuil,</hi> they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d out this new deuice to attempt him withall, ſeemely for ſuch Familiars. Two or three of them came ſomewhat nigh about him, and as he hapned to turne in his walke; his backe being
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17938:22"/>
towards them, on a ſuddaine one of them calleth him by his old name. The party being in earneſt talke, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting nothing, ſuddenly looked behind him, &amp; made anſwer: whereupon the catchpoles forthwith laid hands on him, and were cleerely reſolued that hee was the ſelfe ſame man. This fellow lay in yrons a good ſeaſon, and after long impriſonment was whipped about the towne, and condemned to the gally perpetually. and thus was he ſerued for hurting the <hi>Alguazil,</hi> partly through his owne folly and negligence for want of a little heede ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. The which deuices albeit they be very ſubtile, and ſuch as no mans wiſedome can auoide, yet ſhall it not be greatly amiſſe to ſhew one other ſpecial example, how God oftentimes maketh them ſtarke fooles, and guardeth his with a holy kind of policy, that they may bee able to goe an ace beyond them. Not long ſince there was a certaine man of the Low Countries that had eſcaped out of the Inquiſitors priſon at <hi>Valladolit,</hi> who was apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the profeſſion of the Goſpell, and had bin a long ſeaſon in priſon. There went out to ſeeke him (as the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome is) diuers of theſe hunting Familiars, who within a few leagues off, ouertooke him in the high way, and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him. The party told them flatly hee was not the man <note place="margin">The Fiſcal.</note> they tooke him for; and yet would not theſe good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes leaue him, but by force and ſtrong hand went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to bind and bring him backe againe, ſtill contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, affirming him to be the ſelfe-ſame man whom they tooke him to be: and thereupon demanded of him, not doubtingly, but as though the matter were very cleere; Are not you he (Sir) that eſcaped out of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors priſon at <hi>Valladolit,</hi> about eight dayes ſince? Not I (Sirs) ſaith he, ſetting a good face on the matter, and therefore view me better. I am no ſuch man, but am new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come from <hi>Castile,</hi> where I haue wrought in mine oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation a great while: and becauſe you ſhall the better credit my words, and know it to be ſo, here is my teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17938:23"/>
which I carry for my paſport, take and reade it: and forthwith tooke out a certaine writing which he had about him, and offred it them to read. Which, after they had read it, they gaue credit vnto, and let him goe with ſhame enough that they had been ſo childiſhly deceiued in taking one man for another, as to their thinking they had done. And as touching the teſtimoniall that ſtood him in ſo good ſteed, this is the truth of it. After his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of priſon, making as much ſpeed in his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney as poſſibly he could, he chanced to meete with a countrey man of his by the way, one of his old acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the other was departed from him but two dayes before, and left his teſtimoniall behind him in this mans hand to keepe: whereby he was in good time preſerued, and they colted like knaues very prettily. Yet haue theſe Familiars another fetch beyond all this, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triue them that are eſcaped and fled away. As, ſome of them ſhall trace him by his footing if they can finde his foot-ſteps: others ſhall purſue him that way whither they thinke in their owne iudgements hee is moſt like to bee gone: another crew of them ſhall lye in waite for him by night, becauſe they are ſure he will trauell by night rather than by day. For I tell you, they are moe than a good ſort that are appointed for theſe purpoſes; inſomuch that a flie cannot eſcape the Inquiſitors fingers, but there ſhall be enow at hand ready to fetch her againe. But God, againſt all their deuices and narrow ſearching dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ſhall arme and ſafegard him, whom his good will and pleaſure is to deliuer. And thus much concerning the apprehending. Now to tell how they entreate them after they be arreſted and committed to ward,</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IMmediately after euery arreſt done by the <hi>Alguazil,</hi> or complaint made to the court of any perſon by any of the Familiars, they ſtraightway take from about him all the keyes of his cheſts or lockes whatſoeuer, if he haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and forthwith ſend a Notary and certaine catchpoles with the <hi>Alguazil</hi> himſelfe to take an inuentory of all ſuch goods as are in his houſe whatſoeuer they be. Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done very exactly, ſuch as they finde, they leaue in the cuſtody of ſome rich man dwelling thereabout, who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh to be accomptable therefore, and to re-deliuer them duly and truly whenſoeuer they ſhall be demanded. But in this <hi>Sequester</hi> (as they terme it) the owners of ſuch goods had need to looke well about them, and alwayes haue an eye to their fingers which are at the ſequeſtration, and are the doers, ſpecially when they come to rifling of money and iewels, either gold or ſiluer, or any other thing els that is of any price, and light for conueiance, or will lye in a narrow roome. For they are commonly lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingred, and willightly make ſomething ſticke by them, if they be not narrowly ſeene vnto. And indeed the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of this rabble of Familiars are bauds, theeues, ſhif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the vileſt ſort of people that liue only by filching, which cannot, nor will not hold their hands if they ſhould hang for it. Beſides that, they are perſuaded in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that they ſhould not in ſuch caſes forbeare other mens goods, although they haue no manner of right thereto.</p>
               <p>Now to tell you briefly whereto this ſequeſtration ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. Forſooth, that if it happen the party be condemned, ſo that his goods or any part thereof be confiſcate, this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſe I warrant you will not loſe ſo much as a dodkin of them. For who knoweth not thus much, that the prey and ſpoyles of ſuch ſilly ſoules is all that they ſeek for? els what ſhould theſe holy fathers that reſpect nothing but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17938:24"/>
vertue and godlineſſe, doe with their goods (I pray you) whom they beare vs in hand they would ſo faine bring home againe to the right way? Or who is ſo mad to think that misbelief can be amended by loſſe of lands or goods? Yet it may very well beſeeme Chriſtian men to be ſpoyled of all their ſubſtance, yea, and of their clothes from their backs alſo, by their enemies, ſeeing their head, whoſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers they are, and whoſe truth they profeſſe, was ſo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: for whoſe garments (likewiſe) not much worth, perhaps halfe thread bare with wearing, after they had put him moſt cruelly to death, they determined alſo to caſt lots. And this kind of Sacriledge is now ſo ratified and confirmed by the common conſent of their <hi>Diuines,</hi> that is to ſay, the Monkes and the reſidue of the Clergy, that they ſhame not to preach &amp; teach openly, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer is not iumpe with the Pope, or diſſenteth from him in the leaſt iot, is bound in conſcience, in all haſt (ſay they) to bring in all his goods into the Kings Eſchecquer, and that he hath no more right vnto them then if he had rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the King of them before, alleadging this reaſon, that for ſo much as he is reuolted from the Church of Rome, he is no longer any right owner thereof, but the King, to whom the Pope hath adiudged them. Wherefore a man is bound (ſay they) to reſtore them vnto him, although the Inquiſitors neuer heard ſo much as one word of him. And thus theſe ſubtill foxes by this one policy are both greatly gracious with Princes, and therewithall doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigle the conſciences, &amp; pick the purſes of the ſilly foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh people, deeming them as gods. But to returne to our purpoſe. As ſoon as the priſoner is entred within the firſt gate of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
                  </hi> priſon, the keeper hauing with him a Notary, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him if he haue a knife about him, or mony, or rings or any other iewels.

               <p>AFter they haue thus continued in priſon about a week or two, the Inquiſitors priuily packe with the Iaylor to be in hand with the priſoner, as though it came from himſelfe, and to aduiſe him to ſue that he may come to his anſwer, and pray to haue a day of hearing. Wherein, it is not to be thought the contrary, but that there is ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery meant thereby, that the priſoner muſt firſt begin to ſtir in his owne cauſe. The keeper therefore either at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner time, or ſome other moſt conuenient to bring his matters about, reſorteth to his priſoner, and among other talke, at the laſt falleth to queſtion with him how it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that he ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17938:25"/>
therein to his power, like a faithfull and truſty friend. Yet ſurely it may be thought with good reaſon, that if any thing may doe the poore wretch good, being in caſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for to be deuoured by theſe rauenous beaſts, it will fall out in the end to be better for him if he refuſe to craue a day of hearing, and tarry till the Commiſſioners doe call for him. But if there be none other good to be done, hee may chance to get this by his tarrying; in driuing them to begin with him, to take care for nothing but only to make anſwer to their obiections. But ſith it is ſo ſecret a myſtery, I will let it goe, and leaue it to the iudgements and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of the wiſer ſort to ſcan and iudge vpon. The poore priſoner knowing none of theſe ſubtilties, for the moſt part is ruled by his keeper, thinking that he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him good and wholeſome aduice, and prayeth him therefore to be a meane for him, and in his behalf to craue a day of hearing: whoſe ſute is eaſily heard of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and granted at the firſt I warrant you. Whereupon the party is brought into the Conſiſtory, where the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, as though he were altogether ignorant of the matter, beginneth to talke with him much after this ſort: <hi>Sirha,</hi> your keeper came and told vs, that you were deſirous to come to your anſwer. Now ſay on, what is your ſute? The priſoner anſwereth, that he would be very glad to haue his matter heard. And vnleſſe he look well about him, and be circumſpect in his dealing, very lothſomneſſe of his impriſonment, and fear of afterclaps, driueth him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ſomewhat whereof he ſuſpecteth himſelfe to be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. The which thing doth the Fathers good at their hearts, becauſe they are accuſtomed at this and ſundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeaſons, to grant the priſoners dayes of hearing, and to call them often into the Court before they ſhall know their whole accuſation, and all that is depoſed againſt them (which by order and common courſe of law ſhould haue beene the firſt act that ſhould haue beene done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them) and all is to this onely end, to make the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17938:25"/>
vtter ſomewhat of himſelfe raſhly and vnawares, that they as yet know not of. They aduiſe him moreouer to let it come from himſelfe, promiſing that if hee will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his faults voluntarily, he ſhall be foorthwith ſent home againe to his owne houſe, and bee diſpatched with all expedition, and dealt withall as gently as may be. But if for all theſe vaine and flattering promiſes he hold them hard, and ſtand mute (as indeede it is beſt for him) they charge him earneſtly to disburden his owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and when he hath bethought himſelfe, and is diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to confeſſe any thing, that then he ſhould ſue to come to his anſwer, ſaying that in the meane time, they will conſider of his caſe, and ſo they remand him to priſon. Then after 6. or 8. dayes or mo, as they thinke good, they call for him againe, and aske him if as yet he be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to confeſſe ought. The priſoner anſwereth, either that he hath nothing to ſay, but that he is innocent, or perhaps confeſſeth ſomewhat. But whatſoeuer his anſwer be, they are ſure ſtill harping on their old ſtring, vrging him to diſcharge his conſcience, and perſwading him that they goe about no other thing but to doe him good, and to procure his ſafety, of very loue and meere compaſſion which they take vpon him. Which gentleneſſe of theirs, and well meaning towards him, if he refuſe now, and ſet light by, he ſhall finde them ſharpe Iuſticers hencefoorth if the <hi>Fiſcall</hi> informe againſt him, and ſo ſend him againe to priſon. The <hi>Fiſcall</hi> is an officer which taketh all ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations as the Promoters bring vnto him, and by office is the onely pleader, during the whole time that the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes be hanging, as it were the Kings Atturney, hauing his name no doubt <hi>à Fiſco,</hi> that is to ſay, the Eſchecquer: for whoſe aduantage he is altogether, and from whence hee is anſwered his fee.</p>
               <p>At the third day of audience, the party is called for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and demanded, if yet hee be reſolued what to doe, with earneſt requeſt after their accuſtomed maner, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17938:26"/>
a troth of his owne accord: if not, they threaten to vſe extremity towards him, and what they can do by law. And here they vnderſtand by this word law, extreme tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and mangling of men, yea ſuch as their owne owne lawes doe prooue very Innocents, ſaying hee may well aſſure himſelfe, that no man ſhall ſuſtaine any iniury within their holy Office, and that their faſhion is not to trouble any man but vpon good and ſufficient informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt him, with ſuch like talke. Howbeit, if the party happen to diſcloſe any thing: nay (ſay they) yet are we not ſatisfied, we haue not all you can ſay, we ſuſpect you keepe ſomething in of purpoſe, and ſo ſend him to priſon, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to further paine, and calling him <hi>coram</hi> day by day, as they perceiue that by theſe means they wring more &amp; more out of him, though it be but by little &amp; little. But if he ſtand ſtoutely in the matter, giuing them direct an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer that he hath nought to ſay in that place, by a ſhift of deſcant (as it were) they try him another way, exacting an oth of him: &amp; to the intent to proue his zeal, they hold him an Idol, repreſenting the crucifixe, couered with a blacke lawn, &amp; certain other Idols, I wot not what. They do alſo lay before him a Maſſe book or a Miſſall, and ſometime the bare image of the croſſe. For ſuch deuices and fooliſh toyes as theſe be, they haue alwaies in a readines to vſe as occaſion ſerueth, &amp; as they think moſt requiſit, reſpecting the party whom they are to deal withall. Here is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man driuen into a narrow ſtreight, ſo that he muſt needs vtter himſelf, and plainly ſhew what he is in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and in belief. For if he be a faithfull man indeed, and one that from the bottom of his heart abhorres Idolatry, hauing before his eies the fear of God moſt mighty &amp; iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, which in his moſt holy law hath reſerued this glory to himſelf, that we ſhould ſwear by him alone, he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that in no wiſe he giue part therof to ſuch vile Idols of wood or mettall; which being made to reſemble the higheſt in ſhape, are ſo much the more abominable in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17938:26"/>
ſight of God, and of his congregation. Therefore a godly man will take heed of ſuch a wicked and vngodly oath, yea though he were to be torne in pieces preſently, ſeeing they be very Idols, and not God, to whom alone that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour belongeth, as the Inquiſitours themſelues cannot ſay to the contrary. After they haue thus put him to his oath, they begin to examine him vpon theſe interrogat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, many other things they inquire of him; as of his age, and trade of life, where and with what manner of men he hath been moſt conuerſant: and thus is he ſorced to giue a ſtraight account of his whole life, where he hath paſſed his time yearly, and made his moſt abode, anſwering to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery point by it ſelfe ſeuerally. For out of each of theſe queſtions they fetch no ſmall arguments, wherewith they charge the poore ſoule afterward too too pittifully. When he hath anſwered to all theſe by-queſtions, then fal they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh to their old exhortation, ſometime by faire meanes, and ſometime by foule, aduiſing him to tell the truth frankely, aſſuring him, that they neuer cauſe any to bee arreſted without iuſt cauſe why, or without ſufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: ſo that whether he confeſſe or no, away he goeth to priſon againe.</p>
               <p>And in theſe three firſt times of hearing, a great ſort are either allured with their faire ſpeeches and promiſes, that they ſhall bee ſent home to ther owne houſes as ſoone as they will confeſſe that that is demanded of them; or elſe of very awe and feare of their euill and mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing words, vtter many things whereof the Inquiſitors

knew not one iot before, becauſe none had informed them thereof, but themſelues onely ſuſpected, leſt they had been accuſed by ſome, with whom they had dealt heretofore in ſuch affaires. Thus betraying themſelues like fooles, they bring other men into as euill caſe as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, which perhaps neither feared any ſuch matter at all, nor the Inquiſitors had euer heard any thing of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But moſt of all, when they perceiue that theſe moſt holy Fathers, who hunt after nothing ſo much, as daily to haue change of ſpoyles, will take it thankefully at their hands, then labour they by all meanes poſſible to curry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with them, to get themſelues rid out of miſery, and to be ſet at liberty: So that it commeth oftentimes to paſſe, that the parties being at the firſt arreſted for very tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling matters, vndoe both themſelues and many others moe, by giuing ouer-much credit to the fair promiſes and goodly gloſes of theſe falſe and faithleſſe Inquiſitors, through want of skill how to behaue themſelues in their owne affaires, much leſſe able to iudge and diſcerne what opinion they ſhould haue of theſe Fathers, that is to ſay, not to be fathers (as they glory to be called in deriſion of all humanity, piety, and fatherlineſſe) but their moſt cruell and deadly enemies, which by craft, ſubtilty, and lying, and by all kind of knaueries, priuily goe about to get that they gape for, both life and goods of the guilty, and of the guiltleſſe.

The next leſſon is to keep his tongue for his life, &amp; ſpeake not one word till the time that he hath heard his accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with the depoſitions, whereunto he is bound by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of law to make anſwer.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, at the fourth day of hearing, they tender him an oath, vehemently exhorting him to ſhriue himſelfe voluntarily: otherwiſe they will deale with him as hardly as the law will permit them, if the <hi>Fiſcall</hi> once commence his ſute againſt him. And if he do yet perſeuere conſtantly, affirming that he hath no more to ſay, then reade they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him a long inditement, &amp; charge him with many great matters, falſely forged and deuiſed againſt him, ſuch as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the party did euer ſo much as thinke vpon, nor any had accuſed him of to them. For it is a point of cunning forſooth in this their crafty faculty, for the Fathers to make theſe great matters and huge offices on their fingers ends for theſe ſpecial cauſes. Firſt, by thus loading the poor man, and laying to his charge many great and made matters, to bring him into ſuch a maze, that being ſcarcely his owne man, he ſhall not well know where he is, nor which way to turne him, nor what anſwer to make. Secondarily, to prooue if happely he will admit any of theſe miſdemeanors that are laid againſt him, or at the leaſt, if by argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any of them they can trippe him in his tale, and ſo catch him in their net. Is this then their following of Gods iudgements, whoſe cauſe theſe Fathers of the faith brag and boaſt ſo much, and beare the ſilly ignorant people in hand, that they take vpon them to maintaine, in the very firſt ſteppe of the ſtage, whereon they are ready bent to do execution of a ſort of innocents, thus ſhamefully and moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly to cry, <hi>Ariſe (O Lord) and iudge thine owne cauſe?</hi> Do <note place="margin">Pſal. 74.</note> theſe policies proceede of faith (trowe ye) where of they tearme themſelues the Patrons?

And to this effect well neare, they vſe many big words to make the ſimple folke afraid withall. Next to this, they charge them alſo with other matters, ſometime of more importance, ſometime of leſſe: Prouided alwayes, that the matter wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the party is accuſed, be brought in, either in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or ending, or elſe ſome other thing that ſome man hath him half in a iealouſie for. Which thing they lay to his charge, not as a matter ſurmiſed or of likelihood, but moſt conſtantly affirmed and teſtified by witneſſes. For in this
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17938:28"/>
holy Conſiſtory they may do what they liſt, and what they think expedient. Then is the party accuſed put to anſwer to euery article that is laid againſt him, ſeuerally and directly, either yea or no, as he thinketh good, hauing alwayes a clerke by him to record euery word that he ſpeaketh. After this examination and confeſſion thus had &amp; done <hi>Ex tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi> without either order or any great aduiſement, they ſtraightway giue him pen, inke, and paper to put in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in writing if he will; pretending hereby, that they work for him al the means &amp; helps that may be to try him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an honeſt man. And thus is this crafty Inquiſition clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with this goodly pretence of equity &amp; iuſtice, where in very deed this is their fetch, that hearing him firſt make one confeſſion by word of mouth ſuddenly and without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſement, and after that another with more deliberation in writing, they may eaſily find ſome ods betwixt the one and the other, hauing neither any copy of his former confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to lay before him, nor being able for very feare &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of mind to remember euery word that hath eſcaped him. But if there chance to be no contrariety, yet haply ſhall there be ſomwhat either more or leſſe in the one than in the other.

For albeit theſe raueners be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry greedy of that anſwer that was ſuddenly made, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſtudy, yet ſet they moſt ſtore by that that was of his owne penning, ſpecially if it bee done by one that is learned, whom by common and daily experience they know to be of that nature for the moſt part, that whiles they labour to auoyd matters of no great importance by ſome nice conſtruction, they fall into diuers other abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or at the leaſt, by vttering a little of their poore skill they miniſter much matter for captious fellowes to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and cauill vpon. By meanes whereof, many times ſuch learned clarkes, who at the firſt fell into their fingers but onely for trifles, were afterward burdened with ſo many matters and ſo weighty, that they could neuer rid them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues thence, til either they went to the ſtake, or els endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome other puniſhment, led the reſt of their life in perpetuall ſhame and ignominy.

As for example, I will report a thing that hapned at <hi>Siuil</hi> a few yeares agoe: neither need I to coyne any examples in a caſe ſo common as this is, that is almoſt in experience dayly in that holy Court of theirs, to the great loſſe and vtter vndoing of many ſilly and ſimple ſoules.</p>
               <p>There was a certaine man cited before the Inquiſitors at <hi>Siuil,</hi> for ſaying in preſence of his familiar friends &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, that he knew none other Purgatory but one, &amp; that was the blood of Chriſt, which daily waſheth and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth our ſinnes. The party who ſaid it, was but a ſimple man, brought vp in the countrey all the dayes of his life, hauing no ſpark of good ciuility in him, or of any good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and by chance hearing this on a time among cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his companions, liked thereof very well; but now, comming before the Fathers for the ſame matter, told them plainly how he was of the ſame mind once, marry ſith it miſliketh their worſhips, he is very well content to forſake it. But what did it auaile (thou foole) to make ſo raſh and ſo ſudden a recantation? By confeſſing the matter, thou ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt them agogge. By keeping thy tongue, thou hadſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them to their very galles. By making thy purgation, thou couldeſt but haue loſt thy labor. Yet this did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners, but there muſt needs be ſome other quarrell picked againſt him. For the Inquiſitors Organs (forſooth) went hard for want of exerciſe, &amp; therfore they muſt neceſſarily haue ſome body to play vpon them, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17938:30"/>
keep them from ruſting. <hi>Ergo,</hi> ſay they, and conclude of this antecedent againſt this poor plough-man, the Church of Rome which in time paſt hath determined the contrary by law, doth erre, and the councel erreth alſo, and iuſtification commeth by faith only, wherein a man is made free &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued <hi>à poena &amp; culpa.</hi> To be ſhort, out of theſe they fetch a rabble of opinions and aſſertions, which they call hereſies, &amp; charge the poor man with euery of them, as if he had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed them all in plain tearms, ſay he nay neuer ſo ſtoutly that he knoweth nothing of any ſuch matters, nor ſo much as once euer thought vpon them. Now who ſeeth not that this kind of proceeding in this holy office is packed full of ſubtill policies, and all the diuelliſh practices and deuices that may be? Yet herein is the mighty prouidence of God toward his elect ſpecially to be had in admiration, that theſe men wanting the means of calling &amp; teaching which other men haue to induce them by, in a place ſo quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe means as is fire to water, are both called and taught by God, hauing their eyes opened by him, &amp; their vnderſtanding lightned. For the Inquiſitors themſelues, who ſeek vtterly to deſtroy and root vp all faith &amp; truth, they (I ſay) by ſuch meanes as I haue before declared, are <hi>y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
                  </hi> very preachers, teachers, and furtherers of the ſame, as it is euident and manifeſt by many notable examples of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry perſons that haue fallen into their hands only for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting raſhly and fooliſhly, rather then of purpoſe or adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly, that there is no purgatory, and that it is but a dreame and no ſuch thing indeed; whereas they haue been at their firſt comming in, ignorant in moſt of the points concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſaluation, by their only queſtionings, collections, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, brought either in forme or out of forme, haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted thence very well inſtructed: wherof this rude fellow of the countrey, of whom I laſt made mention, may bee a ſufficient teſtimony. Moreouer, if he party chance to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe ought, they vſe to haue another hooke ready bayted, ſharpe and perilous enough, I warrant you: to wit, they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17938:30"/>
enquire of him whatſoeuer it be, of whom he learned or heard it, or if he haue haply read it in ſome booke, or if hee haue had any conference with any other about the ſame matter, or he himſelfe haue been an inſtructer to others, or by any meanes haue mentioned it in the preſence of any: in what place he did ſo, and who they were that ſtood by? For whoſoeuer was preſent, whether they liked his talk or no, yea though it were his owne father, or nigher him, if nigher could be, they are ſure to buy it full dearly: the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors will haue a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>irt at them, becauſe they came not foorth with, &amp; made complaint thereof vnto them. All w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> things it behooues a man greatly to be cunning in, that if it be Gods will that he fall into their hands, he may learne before hand out of his holy word and will how to preuent them, and prouide an anſwer to ſuch demands, leſt he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe both himſelfe and others through his owne folly and negligence. At the laſt, when his accuſation is read, if the party be an infant (as we tearme one within age) they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide him a Patron whom they call a Tutor. A very godly <note place="margin">The Tutor.</note> way (no doubt) if ſuch a man were appointed to that place as would play his part ſtoutly, and as it becometh him in reſpect of his office. Howbeit he is no ſuch manner of man as the infant would and ſhould haue for the better brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of his matters about, but one of their own choce, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> either is a very wolfe to ioyn with them againſt the ſimple lambe, or at the moſt, to ſtand like a cipher in Arithmetick, and doe nothing but fill vp a place, and for faſhion ſake and order ſtand in ſtead of a Tutor to performe the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and circumſtances of the law. For moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Porter of their <hi>holy houſe</hi> ſerueth that turne, or in his abſence ſome other of the Porters lodge, and indeede but onely that he beareth the bare name and title of a Tutor, dealing in nothing that appertaines to the office, my Lords <hi>Muleter</hi> may eaſily be Tutor in ſuch ſort to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the priſoners all at once. By reaſon whereof, the Porter cannot alwayes bee ready to anſwer euery bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17938:31"/>
that knocketh at the gate. And on this ſort do theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers fulfill the commandements of God, and the laws of man touching poore infants and orphanes, who as well by the law of God as of nature, are commended ſo ſpecially to the conſideration and regard of all men, but moſt chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Iudges.</p>
               <p>Neither reſt they here, contenting themſelues to mocke the law in this point alone, but in another of more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance: wheras the law prouideth, that euery defendant <note place="margin">The Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.</note> ſhall haue his Aduocate, ſome man expert in the law, to pleade his cauſe, and order it diſcreetly according to law and conſcience, and to defend their right if any they haue, or at the leaſt to temper the rigor of the law, leſt it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued and miniſtred with extremity in this ſo waighty a matter, and the onely ſuccour that theſe ſilly ſoules haue to helpe themſelues withall; they deale with them in like ſort as they do in the former for appointing them a Tutor, and ſo ſhift it off with a meere ſhadow and a bare ceremony: onely becauſe it is a very waighty matter, therefore they would ſeeme full of curteſie and humanitie, and would faine cloke their wicked contempt of lawes with ſome goodly pretence. For they name vnto the party 3. or 4. of the moſt famous men toward the lawes, to chuſe out of them ſome one to pleade his cauſe, and beſides all this their gentleneſſe (of fatherly affection I dare ſay) they aduiſe him to take ſuch a man, who in their iudgements is the beſt learned. And what would a man deſire more? Yet whoſoeuer is choſen to be his Aduocate, will bee ſure that he tell not his Clyent any point of law that may doe him eaſe any way. For he knoweth right well, that if the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors haue intelligence thereof, he ſhall not ſcape ſcotfree, ſeeing their meaning is nothing leſſe then to prouide him an Aduocate to defend his cauſe, but onely to bleare the common peoples eyes withal, and make them beleeue that they proceede by order of law like good conſcionable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where in very deede they compaſſe their matters
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17938:31"/>
both againſt Gods lawe and mans. For the Aduocate and his Clyent may not ſo much as haue a word together ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly of any matter, but in preſence and hearing of the Inquiſitours or of ſome Notary. And what doth the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate then would a man thinke? Marry he receiueth his Clyents anſwer to the accuſation rude and rough hewn as it were, and that doth he ſmooth and ſet together in forme of lawe (yet ilfauouredly framed full oft, God wot) and all this while taketh vpon him the name of an Aduocate, onely to delude the lawe withall. But forward to our purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Within 2. or 3. dayes after the party hath had the copy of his accuſation, he is called into the court, where his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate ſtandeth, like one that would ſtoutly defend his Clyentes cauſe, and ſaue all ſuch matters as ſhould ſeeme to make againſt him. Then the Inquiſitour, as though hee had done the party an high pleaſure, &amp; diſcharged his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience wholly for that part of the lawe, pointeth out the Clyent his Aduocate with his finger, and ſtraightway fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into his old note, exhorting him to vtter the truth, and take heede to his conſcience, and if hee haue any more to ſay, to ſay it at once. All which time the Aduocate ſitteth or ſtandeth mute, and if he haue ought to ſay, yet dare hee not let it come out before hee haue made the Inquiſitours of his counſell. For the Aduocate all the while that hee is telling his tale, ſo eyeth the Inquiſitours, that one of their eyes is neuer off from the other: the Inquiſitour is ſo much afraid leſt the prating Aduocate vtter ſomething raſhly &amp; vnawares, wherin the Clyent might eſpy ſomwhat for his aduantage in lawe, and ſo auoyd the danger of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and hidden ſnares. The Aduocate on the other ſide is as much afraid, and quaketh euery part of him, leſt any word chance to ſlip him ſuddenly that the Inquiſitours happly ſhall not well like of, and therefore dare ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for his Clyent, but onely giue him a few wordes of comfort, and bid him bee of good cheer, and tell the truth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:17938:32"/>
in any caſe, ſaying, that that is the onely way to preuaile in this Court: and as for me (ſaith he) I will be ready to do for you the beſt that I can. Then commeth the Inquiſitour in with his part, ſinging the ſame note, and ſo is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner ſent to his priſon againe.</p>
               <p>After this day of hearing, the party beginneth to bee of better courage, hoping that his matter draweth nigh to an end: but it is farre otherwiſe God knoweth. For many of them are forgotten: ſome for a yeare, or halfe a yeare, or perhaps for three or fowre yeares, as it pleaſeth theſe good Fathers to deale with them, and there they lie in priſon, as it were a peece of leather that lieth ſteeping in the tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners fatte. During all which time, they neither are called any more, nor one word mentioned for their deliuerance. Then, if any for very lothſomnes and intolerable filth by reaſon of their long impriſonment, do craue to come to their anſwer, ſome perhaps obtaine it, and ſome go without it: but in the end both their luckes are alike. For they that after long ſuite get a grant thereof, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded into a Parler; where they haue ſuch countenances made them, and ſuch ſpeach vſed towards them, that it is eaſie to be eſpied, that they haue no manner of regard vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them at all: and there (forſooth) they put them a queſtion a great deale meeter to be asked of men in a farre better caſe then they are in. As for the purpoſe: what their ſute is? or what they would haue? Whereunto each anſwereth, that he would bee glad to haue ſome end and determination of his trouble. Marry and thereabouts we go (ſay they) as carefully as wee can, and aſſure your ſelfe we will not forget you. But if he be earneſt to haue it determined, they bid him bethinke himſelfe then, and ſay the truth, asking him why hee no more regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his conſcience? &amp;c. At the length, laying the fault of his long impriſonment to himſelfe (whereas hee poore man would haue been content, if hee might haue had his choyce, to come forth to the ſtake, rather then to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17938:32"/>
continue there ſo long) they ſend him to priſon againe. And albeit they afterward do grant him diuers other daies of hearing: yet as he continueth his ſute, ſo keepe they him off with their accuſtomed delaies, till they thinke it bee time to communicate vnto him the depoſitions made againſt him, which they terme the publication of the witneſſes.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AFter a long &amp; loathſom time of impriſonment, in ſuch ſort as ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s nature is not able to endure it any longer, when the poor ſoule in their iudgements is brought ſo low, that he could be content to be delivered with all his heart, though it coſt his life, &amp; therfore likely to tell all &amp; more too, yea, euen as much as they themſelues can demand or deſire: they call him yet again before them, &amp; in a ſpeech framed as it were a mean betwixt a ſharp rebuking &amp; a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle admonition, doe aske him how it happeneth that hee hath ſlipt his owne matters ſo long, and now at the length would haue him come in and tell the truth. Vpon which point they ſtand very long in perſwading him: and then eyther on this or the next day of hearing, the <hi>Fiſcall</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth his action againſt him, praying that publication may bee made of the witneſſes: which being granted, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the depoſitions are deliuered to the party, but yet without any names ſubſcribed. The order and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof is a ſufficient declaration what great zeale this holy Court hath to bring the truth to light. For all things are ſo difficultly reported and ſo abruptly; ſo wreſted and wrung with ſuch doubtfull tearmes of double ſenſe and vnderſtanding, that a man would iudge him ſure neuer well in his wittes that vttered them. And this is a peece of the <hi>Legerdemaine</hi> of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Houſe, purpoſely inuented to driue the party alwaies into a doubt, euen of thoſe points which hee knoweth are alreadie depoſed againſt him. Secondarily, that ſo nigh
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:17938:33"/>
as may be, he ſhould haue no maner of knowledge of the witneſſes, who they were that did depoſe againſt him, leſt happly hee ſhould take ſome exception againſt them. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that if he haue conferred with any other then his accuſers, concerning thoſe matters whereof hee is accuſed, and knowing not who were his accuſers, but labouring to find them out, ſhould perhappes reckon vp all, and ſo by that meanes bring a great ſort of mo fiſhes to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitours holy Angle.</p>
               <p>And here would I be glad to know of theſe Fathers of the Faith, ſeeing they are ſo well learned in the laws (if they would be ſo good as to tell vs how it commeth about) that whereas the <hi>Publication of witneſſes</hi> is ordeyned of common right to bee vſed ſincerely and plainly, yet in this holy Court it hath no place, neither is allowed for lawe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the names of the witneſſes are ſuppreſſed, and ſo the one halfe of the law, yea the better halfe of it, is curtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and quartered, and the reſidue neither vprightly han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, nor faithfully, but moſt craftily and falſly abuſed, as I will make relation hereafter. And if an exception will lie againſt witneſſes, not onely by order of law, but in other reſpects vpon very good and neceſſary conſiderations, becauſe knaues and villaines ſhould not any way trouble nor moleſt honeſt men that are guiltleſſe and innocent, why is there no place in this moſt holy Court for ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions? For in ciuill cauſes but of ſmall importance, they <note place="margin">Witneſſes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in their holy Inquiſition.</note> will not admit a mans enemy, nor a lyer, nor a defamed perſon, nor an Idiot, nor a Bedlam, nor a drunkard, nor a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ew, nor a villaine, nor any ſuch kind of people to bee ſworne as witneſſes: and who then (I pray you) hath enabled all this route of Rakehels, in matters of religion and the weightieſt cauſes that can bee, to bee accepted and admitted for witneſſes, and that their teſtimony ſhall bee receiued and reputed in matters touching life and death: ſeeing they are diſabled by all lawes to condemne any man in the leaſt trifles that may come in queſtion betwixt man
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:17938:33"/>
and man? But here perchance they will ſay they deny not, but the party hath very good liberty of challenge againſt the witneſſes, if he could learne by any meanes or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture who they be that depoſed againſt him. Therefore if hee chance at any time to geſſe him right that hath thus teſtified againſt him, ſo that the Court iudge him inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and doth therefore refuſe him, they haue done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table iniury to both parts, or to one of them at the leaſt. Firſt of all to the witneſſe, by refuſing him now, if they did right before in ſuppreſſing his name, becauſe the party ſhould not know him: next, to the party himſelfe, being now at the length content to admitte his exceptions, ſo he can geſſe or by ſome other meanes learne his name, and haue ſufficient matter to charge him withall, and ſuch as may bee thought good cauſe of challenge: which ſurely in all indifferent mens iudgements that haue any conſciences at all, is an horrible and moſt deteſtable kinde of iniurie. But to returne to their policies. The depoſitions of the witneſſes therefore is an euident proofe, aſwell by their order and manner of examination, as alſo by their kind of ſpeach therein vſed, whether the Inquiſitours haue kept the <hi>euen ſtreet,</hi> or gone by <hi>crooked lane.</hi> For this is moſt ſure that they are not commonly read to the party in ſuch ſort as the witneſſes haue depoſed, but if any thing be vttered beſides by the witneſſes that might make for the priſoner, or be conſtrued on his ſide, they reiect all that as needeleſs and ſuperfluous, admitting onely that that maketh moſt againſt him, and clap on all that on their owne biace ſide. For the further proofe and declaration whereof it will bee worth the noting vnto you, to ſhew what their common vſage is in regiſtring of ſuch depoſitions: As for example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>N. a witneſſe</hi> (ſuppreſſing his name) <hi>ſworneand allowed, &amp;c. ſaith that heeth ſaid N. heard in ſuch a place, and ſuch a yeare, and of ſuch a moneth</hi> (if he can ſo preciſely remember the times) <hi>ſuch a man report, that the aforeſaid,</hi> that is to ſay, the party accuſed, <hi>ſaid thus and thus, &amp;c.</hi> And in their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17938:34"/>
Records (which they call their <hi>Originall proceſſe)</hi> they haue all thoſe circumſtances at large, which they exact of the witneſſes for a further truth and tryall of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but in that exemplified copy which they deliuer to the party himſelfe, very ſubtilly they ſuppreſſe all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of time and perſons preſent, whereby the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty might haue any inkling of his accuſer or witneſſe, ſupplying thoſe places with theſe or ſuch like words: <hi>A certaine perſon: another man: and a third perſon.</hi> In which kind of depoſitons there bee certaine priuy points and nice conceits diligently to bee obſerued, that is to witt: Whenſoeuer they ſay that he heard it of <hi>a certaine perſon whom he hath named,</hi> it is to be vnderſtood, that the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe heard the party himſelfe ſpeake it; and by the craftie conueyance of the Inquiſitors it is ſo brought about, that in the counterfeit copy which they deliuer to the parties hands, it ſeemeth as though he had heard it of ſome other mans mouth, becauſe he ſhall not gheſſe who it was that gaue euidence againſt him: but hauing conferd therin with diuers others, as well as with this man that depoſed againſt him, ſhould no more know who hurt him, then he that playeth at blind-man-buffe can gheſſe who gaue him the blow. And in this behalfe, if the priſoner chance to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any ſuch perſons as the Court hath not yet beene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of, they are incontinently outlawed, and reputed as fauourers of heretickes, for ſuffering an hereticke to ſow ſuch peſtilent ſeedes among them, without making com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint thereof foorthwith to the Inquiſitors. But if the depoſitions bee on this wiſe, <hi>That he heard it of another cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine perſon whom he hath named, &amp;c.</hi> it is to be vnderſtood, that the witneſſe heard it by a meane, and therefore will not ſerue to ioyne with another witneſſe, though he bee man good enough for them, and fitte to feede their ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious humors. The difference betwixt both theſe depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions is no more but this, that in the one this word <hi>other</hi> is vſed, that is not put in the former, which is
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17938:34"/>
onely thus, <hi>that he heard it of a certaine perſon, &amp;c.</hi> This geere, I tell you, is taken out of their <hi>Sancta Sanctorum.</hi> Thus by theſe ſubtill and captious quiddities, the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours beguile many a Chriſtian ſoule that knoweth not their cunning dealings, but thinketh himſelfe ſafe enough, becauſe he feeleth his conſcience free from vttering any vntruth. And truely it is greatly to bee lamented, that ſuch poore wretches being guiltleſſe (God knoweth) a great ſort of them ſhould be ſo hemmed in of theſe crafty Catchpoles ſo farre beyond all humanitie, for want of a little skill in theſe their ſubtill and ſlightfull deuices. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this counſell of ours (perhaps) may doe them ſome manner of pleaſure, for the more eaſie eſpying and auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of theſe their policies. The defendant therfore muſt take heede that he ſpeake not one word at this day of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, tending to the confutation of that which the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes affirme, yea though it be as falſe as God is true, and he himſelfe neuer ſo well able in his owne iudgement to anſwer it preſently; leſt the Inquiſitours by their importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity happen to wring out ſomewhat from him on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, as they vſe to deale with diuers. Onely let him this doe; that is to ſay, craue a Copy of the depoſitions, and licence to anſwer them in writing by leaſure and with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, againſt the next Court day, or ſo ſoone as he can conueniently. In which anſwer, let him ſee in any caſe that hee obſerue thoſe things, whereof in the accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by the <hi>Fiſcall,</hi> I haue giuen him inſtructions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Secondarily, after he hath obtained the Copy, diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to mark of himſelfe, who be witneſſes with the witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and who not, and whether their teſtimony be able and ſufficient to condemne him in theſe matters wherin they beare witnes with the other, or no. As for his Aduocate, he is but onely for faſhion ſake, and it were as good for him to haue one of clou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, for any helpe that he is like to haue <note place="margin">The number and quality of their wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes.</note> at his hand, much leſſe (may ye thinke) at the Inquiſitors. But as concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> witneſſes, two that heard it of report
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17938:35"/>
are in this lawleſſe Court as good as one that heard it of his own mouth: ſo that two ſuch witneſſes of hereſay, and one that heard it of the parties own mouth, are enow to condemne him. Moreouer it is to be noted, that the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Inquiſit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urs priſon, whom they commonly call <hi>Alcaidium,</hi> is as good as two of the beſt witneſſes. And therefore for ſuch mattters as he hath ſeene and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the priſon, his onely teſtimony is ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne any whom he himſelfe accuſeth. Yea, and in ſome caſes one onely witneſſe, though he haue nothing but by hereſay, yet is he ſufficient to put the party in ieopardy of the racke, if he haue not ſome iuſt cauſe of challenge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. But if there were any reſpect at all, or regard of iuſtice in this Court ſo farre from all conſcience, it were enough in all godly and indifferent mens iudgements, either for the parties deliuerance, or at the leaſt for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, to auoyde that quiddity in the depoſitions which I mentioned before, by faire and flat deniall of that, which the witneſſe ſaid onely of hereſay, were this word <hi>other</hi> there or no. Wherewith the Inquiſitors ſeeke to ſalue the matter, and to ſaue themſelues, being indeed but a very falſe and a friuolous cauill, onely, to colour a lye. For ſo ſhould it fall out in the end, that he who depoſed nothing but of hereſay, ſhould, as right and reaſon is, be refuſed as inſufficient: and the other that ſpake of his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe knowledge, be likewiſe reiected, if there were iuſt cauſe of exception: ſo that both their ſecret practiſes ſhould bee auoyded, and the Inquiſitours enforced to lay away all this their double dealing, and to tell him plainely that the witneſſe heard it of his own mouth, and ſo driue the party to auoyd it more ſubſtantially. But what ſhift ſhould a man make in ſuch a caſe? For, hauing the law in their owne hands like Lords, nay, like moſt cruell Tyrants rather, when they know the witneſſe had it at the firſt hand, yet will they make as though they were content to admit the exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the party who took the witnes to be none
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17938:35"/>
other then ſuch as had it by report, and will afterward or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the matter as it pleaſeth them, whiles the party ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that hee hath ſufficiently auoided that witneſſe, and thinketh himſelfe ſure enough for him. Let him therefore well and warily caſt with himſelfe aforehand, or rather pray vnto God to reueale vnto him, what is to bee done in this perplexitie.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, in this holy Court euery <hi>Iohn-a-Nokes</hi> may <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing their holy Inqui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſition.</note> bee a promoter, and euery frantike Bedlam that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelfe, euery varlet or villaine, and ſo forth euery one of the 24. orders, bee he a perſon neuer ſo much diſabled in law to be a witnes. For a hungry hunter, &amp; one that is greedy of his game, will be glad of euery curtalled curre that will do him ſeruice to bring home his prey. But if the Promoter in his information chance to want words of weight, or to miſplace them, or haue forgotten the very words which hee heard the partie ſay, ſo he can hit of the matter, and remember the ſubſtance, the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors by vertue of their office inſtruct him, and bring it into his remembrance again: In ſo much, that oftentimes the Promoter will tell ſuch a tale as neither he heard, nor euer meant to tell, but euen as they themſelues haue promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him word by word: which a man may well thinke is not all of the beſt ſort. Yet God hath ſometimes ſo blinded their ſenſes &amp; vnderſtandings, that they haue quite forgotten both themſelues &amp; all their owne practices and deuices. As it came to paſſe at <hi>Siuil,</hi> that a certaine fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike woman, in the abſence of her keeper chancing to breake looſe, and to vndoe her bolts &amp; irons wherein ſhe was fettered in a certaine godly mans houſe, came to the Inquiſitours to the caſtle <hi>Triana,</hi> and there had almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to them the whole aſſembly of the congregation, which in that great cittie heere and there met in corners. The which (no doubt) had beene a prey alone for them, but that God meruellouſly defended that good flock of his, being at that time very ſmall in compariſon, and farre
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17938:36"/>
vnable to abide the puniſhments which ſince that time they haue for the profeſſion of Chriſt endured moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly. This woman before ſhe fell mad was one of the chiefe in the congregation: I meane for feruencie of zeale and skill in holy ſcripture, farre aboue that which a man would look for at a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s hand. By means whrof, ſhe was very well acquainted with all thoſe, who in this perillous time profeſſed the Goſpell of Chriſt, but in the heat of her phrenſie all her former loue and zeale that ſhe bare toward the congregation, being turned into an extreme and a deadly hatred, ſhe raged ſo vehemently againſt the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of godly perſons, that in all her madding time ſhee had nothing elſe in her mouth, but cryed vpon the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors on this ſort: <hi>Fire and fagots, fire and burne them;</hi> poſſeſſed (no doubt) of ſome euil ſpirit labouring quite to ouerthrow that good Chriſtian congregation by the meanes of that mad woman. Therefore ſo ſoone as euer ſhe was got looſe, ſhe went ſtraight way with all ſpeed to the Caſtle where the Inquiſitours lay, &amp; there knocked at the gates, which were opened vnto her by and by, as commonly they are not ſtrait kept vpon any that can informe that holy Court a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a ſort of poore innocents. Wherupon at her firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance within the gate, ſhee required that in all haſte ſhe might come to the ſpeech of the Inquiſitours. Who ſtraightway aſſembled all together in their Parler, as it were to conſult about ſome waighty affares, and ſent for the woman before them to heare what ſhe could ſay. Who immediatly decared vnto them, that ſhe had brought them a Bedroll of Lutherans that ſwarmed abroad in the Citie, whiles they that ſhould diligently ſee to ſuch things, ſat idle within and ouer-ſlipt their matters: and ſo began to reckon them, &amp; if ſhe had proceeded, ſhe had appeached to the number of 300 and aboue, that were very earneſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Goſpell: but that the Inquiſitours aſtonied at this ſuddaine ſight, and meruailing at the firſt what this ſhould meane (for till that time there had been little talke
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17938:36"/>
or none of any Lutherans): beſides, eſpying many madde toyes which ſhe vſed in the telling of her tale (which was a truth indeede as ſhe reported it) cauſed her to ceaſe her prating in good time. Yet becauſe they would not bee thought negligent in doing their dutie, though the matter were but of ſmall importance, they kept the woman ſtill, and ſent for the good man in whoſe houſe ſhee was kept, whom ſhe meant to haue made foreman in her bil, becauſe he had enteated her ſomwhat roughly at ſuch times as her fittes were vpon her, to the end to make her leaue her ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. The mans name was <hi>Franciſco à Cafra,</hi> the Parſon of Saint <hi>Vincentes</hi> Church: who afterwardes was impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned for religion &amp; eſcaped away by a miraculous means: notwithſtanding in the very firſt triumph ouer the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans, they burned his picture. When hee was fetcht and brought afore them, being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a good honeſt man, they asked him what the woman meant by talking of ſuch a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Lutherans, &amp;c. but he forthwith forcing a laughter, fained himſelf to maruaile at them, in that they perceiued her not to be beſides her ſelfe; declaring vnto them, that ſhe had bio in that plight by the ſpace of two or three moneths, in ſo much that he was conſtrained to beate her and binde her, as was to ſee by her ſhoulders both blacke and blue, &amp; by the print of the Irons on her legges: adding moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that he for Gods ſake and in the way of charity kept her at his houſe: from whence ſhee brake looſe, cauſing him and his whole houſhold to ſeeke her ouer all the city: howbeit he was now right glad that he had once met with her againe, and found her ſafe. As for the Lutherans whom ſhe prated of ſo much, he told them, that during the time of her fits, ſhe had none other ſong, as moſt commonly mad folke will be alwayes talking of ſome one ſpeciall matter or other. And for the fetters wherein ſhe was chayned at his houſe, if it were their pleaſures either to ſend any to ſee them, or to make enquiry of his neighbors about him, they ſhould find all things ſo as he had reported, and therefore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:17938:37"/>
beſought them, that ſome of their ſeruants might take and bind the woman, and bring her home againe to his houſe. Where at the woman fell into a great rage and exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that all the caſtle rang withall, ſaying ſhee was not mad, but hee was the greateſt and ſtarkeſt Lutheran in all the City, that laded her with Irons, and ſcourged her dayly moſt pittifully. At which words they all fell in a great laughter, and thereupon commanded their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to take and bind her, and to carry her to her old home againe, and to her cold Irons, commending him greatly for his good worke, in taking vpon him ſo great a charge as to deale with a madde woman, and to ſeeke meanes to amend her; aduiſing him hencefoorth to make her ſurer, leſt ſhe ſhould chance to breake looſe hereafter, and make as much buſineſſe at ſome other time. Thus the Inquiſitours forgetting themſelues and their owne practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, loſt at this time as great a prey, as all that amounteth vnto which they had beene ſcraping and gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the harueſt time and increaſe of the Church for two or three years before. But to returne to our matter. It is furthermore to be conſidered and obſerued in this holy Court, that the Promoter neuer ſpeaketh in open Court againſt any perſon, but onely the <hi>Fiſcal,</hi> who is, as it were, an Atturney generall to mooue the Court in all the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are brought vnto him, and to take all the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, and follow them accordingly, ſo that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moter ſerueth him for a witnes. Whereof, like (as of other things) I need not to bring any other proofe or teſtimony then their owne. Let euery man therefore iudge by what right or reaſon they doe it.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THen after 3. or 4. dayes, the party is commanded to come before them, and to put in his anſwer to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions. And with him commeth alſo his Aduocate. But here I ſhould not forget to tell you by the way, that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17938:37"/>
whereas it is the part of euery Aduocate in all iuſt cauſes diligently to conferre with his Client about the depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to aduertiſe him which bee the chiefe and principall points that require anſwer, and not onely thus to do, but alſo to draw the anſwer himſelfe, and ſet it in ſuch order as moſt may further his Clie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts cauſe (elſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to doth an Aduocate ſerue but for ſuch purpoſes?) they leaue the ſimple man to himſelfe, to deuiſe and diſpoſe it as well as he can, hauing none in the world to helpe him, ſaue God alone. And if you aske this holy Court the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, why they doe in this behalfe breake and contemne this cuſtome, which doubtles proceeded of the very law of nature, they can yeeld you no reaſon for it, nor make you any other anſwer, but onely this: Forſooth there is a great difference betwixt this <hi>holy Court,</hi> and other <hi>common Courts.</hi> In very deed they ſay truth, and ſo it is: for all their nice quiddities were not worth a ſtraw, if the parties might there frankly and freely defend themſelues by ſuch means as are to them by all lawes allowable. But when the party hath already framed his anſwer ſo well as he can, then in good time his Aduocate commeth in, to play his part at the length. Who very warily (I warrant you) and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly, as he knoweth full well it ſtandeth him vpon, dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in, ſo dangerous a caſe, leſt he likewiſe, ere hee be aware, fall into the Inquiſitors hands by ſome little o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſight, declareth vnto his Client openly before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitors, which depoſitions they be that touch him nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and what be the great matters that are prooued againſt him, who be witneſſes with the witneſſes, and who not, and that there is no good to be done any way but one, to gheſſe if it be poſſible who is his accuſer, and to deuiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions againſt him. And yet it is not beſt for the Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate here to be ouer buſie in prating to the party, or to put him in mind of any further matter that might doe him good, more then he by aduiſement and leaſure can pick out of himſelfe. Onely this counſell he giueth him, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17938:38"/>
himſelfe, and call his wits together when he is moſt at leaſure, with whom he hath fallen out at any time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be that ſome of his enemies haue accuſed him for ſome old grudge. For if there be any apparant matter of ſome ſpeciall quarrell that hath beene betwixt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and his accuſer, this is all and the onely cauſe of chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge that this Court will admit againſt any witnes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. Furthermore, he declareth vnto him, that he may refuſe peremptorily ſuch witneſſes as haue varied in their tales, or be his enemies, as is aboue-ſaid: or if he can bring mo witneſſes, to proue that he hath alwayes beene an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary to that whereof he is accuſed, and one that hath rather frequented and dayly beene conuerſant in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And here is all the helpe that the poore Client hath at his Aduocates hands. Whereupon hee is remanded to priſon againe, with this <hi>Item</hi> alwayes, that he vtter the truth, with a few menacing words now and then enterla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, more then well doe beſeeme them, that if he will not be ordered in time, they will extort it out of him by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of law: whereby it is giuen the party to vnderſtand, that he ſhall be hencefoorth more ſtraitly examined, and more hardly dealt withall: inſomuch that after three or foure dayes reſpite giuen him to call his wits together, and to remember himſelfe, they ſend for him againe, and aske him whether he hath yet be thought himſelfe, &amp; haue ought to ſay. But whether he hath, yea or no, his Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates queſtion is: If he haue hit on the names of any of his witneſſes or accuſers. Wherin if the party can cal any thing certainly to mind, he declares it vnto the Inquiſitors, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to conſider, whether ſuch and ſuch men be not his accuſers, betwixt whom and him there hath beene an old grudge, which as yet reſteth betwixt them vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded? Howbeit if he gheſſe not a right, beſides this, that his anſwer is not worth a button, both his whole three or foure dayes labour ſpent in gheſſing, is quite loſt, and his accuſation abideth ſtill vntouched. But if he chance to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17938:38"/>
gheſſe right, his Aduocate asketh him what exceptions he can take againſt ſuch as he hath named, but dares not for his life directly tell him that he hath gheſſed aright, for it is not good for him I wis to talke ſo plainely. Yet when the Aduocate hath heard his Clients exceptions, and taken the names of ſuch witneſſes as he nameth vnto him for proof thereof, being now at more liberty then before, he taketh vpon him the charge to examine thoſe matters by interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatories, and further domandeth of his Client, if he be able to bring-in proofe for his better purgation, that he hath beene a friend to the Fryers and Monkes, and familiarly acquainted with them, and diligently obſerued and kept all and ſingular the cuſtomes, rites, and ceremonies of the Church of Rome, and vſed to come often to ſhrift, and to receiue his maker; and in paſſing by any image or croſſe, if he haue done to them their due reuerence, that it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that he is none of <hi>Luthers</hi> ſect. Finally, if hee can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre generally, that he hath beene quite contrary to that whereof he is now accuſed. Which things if he proffer to prooue particularly, the Inquiſitors by ſolemne act in law doe openly declare in Court, that they are content that he make his purgation accordingly within 9. dayes next after. The whole charge whereof, after that the party hath giuen in the names of thoſe witneſſes that depoſed againſt him, reſteth wholly on the Aduocate, as I haue ſaid a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Howbeit euery man hath not thus much fauor ſhewed him to make his purgation on this ſort, but onely in ſuch caſes, where the witneſſes in their depoſitions agreed not with their fellowes, nor greatly with themſelues in their owne tales. For otherwiſe they haue but ſmall ſuccour or none at all to auoyd them by making their owne purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but onely are admitted to take exception againſt the witneſſes (as I ſaid before) if they can deuiſe who they be.</p>
               <p>And when the party is proceeded thus farre, let him perſwade himſelfe, that God hath brought him thither for tryall of his fayth, whether it be pure and perfect, yea
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17938:39"/>
or no. For if he, vpon hope to auoide the preſent perill of the body, determine to uſe ſuch ſhifts for his ſuccour in procuring his purgation by meanes aforeſaid, albeit he be throughly quit in this Court concerning his duty &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Church of Rome and her Idolatries: yet bee he well aſſured, in that generall day of doome which will be ſo terrible to all creatures, &amp; in the judgement of Gods true Church, it will fall out againſt him farre otherwiſe. It ſhall therefore ſtand a man vpon in this caſe to look well about him, and to enter into his owne conſcience, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly debate with himſelfe the cauſes of his impriſonment diligently. For if it be for the glory of God, and the free profeſſing of the truth, and he forſweare Chriſt, treading the bloud of his teſtament vnder his feet, &amp; denying the truth wherunto God hath called and raiſed him out of that deep dungeon of darkneſſe, ignorance, and ſin, hoping by theſe curſed and damnable meanes to eſcape the tyranny of men, perhaps he may doe ſo for a ſeaſon, and purchaſe the favor of men again: but let him him be moſt aſſured, that he ſhall never eſcape the ſharp and moſt juſt judgement of God, from whoſe truth he is revolted: whoſe power is not only over the carcaſſe to kill the body, but afterwards to throw the ſoule into vtter darkneſſe. Therefore if hee haue any ſparke of grace left aliue within him, or any zeale either of Gods glory, or loue of his owne ſalvation, or that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of our Redeemer may waigh with him any thing at all, ſaying: <hi>Whoſo denieth mee before men, him will I deny</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>before my heavenly Father: and he that acknowledgeth me before men him will I alſo acknowledge before my Father and his Angels in heaven &amp;c.</hi> he will wholly reſt vpon that authority, and ſticke to his tackling in that pinch, and vtterly renouncing with heart and mouth all theſe meanes to ſaue this tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life, offred vnto him by his Advocate and the Iudge (whereunto he cannot giue his conſent without great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour to his Creator, and danger of his owne ſoule) will yeeld a plaine and open confeſſion of his faith, thinking
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17938:39"/>
himſelfe a thouſand times in better caſe, that God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued him to that inſtant, to ſuffer ſome affliction for Chriſts ſake, battering in pieces this earthly tabernacle, that is to ſay, a full weak and wearyiſh body, for ſo noble a quarrell as is the honor of God and the building vp of his Church. For theſe curſed meanes to ſaue a mans life (which that holy houſe, the very ſinke of ſin and iniquity, vſeth, of like curteſie and compaſſion as is in the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> to grant to theſe poore ſoules) are not here reported, to the end that the godly ſhould learn hereby the ſhifts to ſaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, but rather, that by knowing them, they ſhould vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly auoyde and abhorre them, and that the world may ſee that all the deuices and policies of this holy Inquiſition tend to no other end, but after they haue layd their cruell hands, continually ſtained with the bloud of ſome of the Saints, vpon any perſon, if he relent and recant Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious truth, ſo to deſtroy him both body and ſoule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, yet at the leaſt to kill his body, ouer which alone their power is able to extend it ſelfe in ſuch as liue in the feare and ſeruice of God duly and truly.</p>
               <p>Thus, after that the party hath endured two or three months in priſon at the diſcretion of theſe good Fathers, they ſend for him foorth once againe to the place of this combate: where the Inquiſitor beginneth to declare vnto him, how that the witneſſes which he brought for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, haue beene heard what they can ſay, and therefore he deſireth to ſee what he can ſay for himſelfe, or elſe to draw to an end. Then he, after their accuſtomed manner, falleth to exhortation that hee tell the truth, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes one peece of their talke, ſo that I beleeue, a man ſhould tell them a good long tale, ere they would be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whereunto the party maketh them ſuch reaſonable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer as he thinketh beſt for his owne caſe. Howbeit, vnto diuers they vſe to put ſundry queſtions, &amp; oppoſe them in their owne anſwer exhibited vp by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in writing, quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at euery letter and ſyllable, like to ſubtill Sophiſters.

And this forſooth is one of their holy deuices, becauſe they would not be thought to lay their hands vpon any perſon raſhly, or without good cauſe why: as they are wont oftentimes to tell the parties by the way, in ſuch exhortations as they make vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, to vtter the truth. The holy houſe is ſo perſwaded of their owne doings, that what extreamity ſoeuer they ſhew vnto the priſoners, yet they think they do vnto them no iniury. Howbeit diuers of them, whom they ſhew ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall fauour vnto for certaine cauſes to them knowne, are ſet at liberty, and ſent away to their owne houſes two or three dayes before the great day of their ſolemnities, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it to be noyſed abroad, that they were accuſed by falſe witneſſes. Yet is this their ſlye dealing open enough to any man that liſt to mark it, euen by this one thing, that a man ſhall neuer fee any ſuch falſe witneſſes openly puniſhed therefore, which in all other caſes are accuſtomably moſt ſharply ſeen vnto. But if they be determined to put any man to the rack at ſuch time as he leaſt looketh for it, then ſhall he be ſure to be brought into the Audience: where all the Inquiſitors, or the greater part of them, ſit in their ſeates of Maieſtie, and beſides them the <hi>Prouiſor,</hi> as they tearme him, or deputy Ordinary of the Dioceſſe, like a ſhepheard ready to flea one of his own flock, who of duty ought to be preſent, as well to heare the ſentences giuen, as to ſee execution miniſtred. And at this Court-day they declare vnto the priſoner, how the Inquiſitours, with all the learned Councell, haue deepely conſidered his whole caſe, bearing him in hand, that they haue found it out for a ſurety that he will not wholly declare the truth, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are reſolued, that he ſhall ride the racke, and there be ſpurred certaine queſtions, and ſo by hooke or by crooke will wring it out of him, will he, nill he: therefore they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe him to do it voluntarily, as he will avoyde the paine
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:17938:41"/>
and perill of the racke. Whereunto they ioyne a certaine exhortation, which they intermingle with ſome ſowre ſpeech of high and threatning words, and ſet it out with great ſeueritie of countenance, rehearſing vnto him all the ſeuerall torments of the racke as terribly as they can deſcribe them, to make him quake in euery ioynt of him. Yet whether he confeſſe, or not confeſſe, all is one, for to the rack he muſt go. Wherupon they ſend for the Officer, &amp; command him to haue the party into that place where <note place="margin">The place where the priſoners are tormented.</note> the Racke ſtandeth, which commonly is a deepe and a darke dungeon vnder the ground, with many a doore to paſſe thorow ere a man can come vnto it, becauſe ſuch as are put thereto, ſhould not be heard to ſhrike or cry: In the which place there is a ſcaffold reared; where the <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,</hi> the <hi>Prouiſor,</hi> and the <hi>Clerke</hi> do ſit, to ſee the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie made of him that is brought to them. Then the linkes being lighted, and all the players entred that haue parts in this Tragedy, the Executioner, who tarrieth laſt to make all faſt (as they ſay) and to ſee euery man in before him, commeth alſo at the length, and of himfelfe alone maketh a ſhew worthy the ſight, more then all the reſt of that rout, being wholly arrayed all ouer from the top of his head to the ſole of his foote in a ſute of blacke canuas, ſuch as the ſuperſtitious Spaniards weare on Maundy-thurſday, when <note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Tormentor.</note> they ſcourge and whip themſelues, as the cuſtome is in moſt places vnder Popery, if not in all: much like that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell that the diuells in ſtage-playes vſe here with vs in England. Moreouer, his head is couered with a long black hood that reacheth ouer all his face, hauing two little peep holes to ſee through, and all to this end, to make the poor ſoule the more afraid both in body and mind, to ſee one torment him in the likeneſſe of a diuell. O Lord, ſuch are their holy guiles.</p>
               <p>After that the Lords be ſet downe each in their places, they begin with him againe, and exhort him afreſh to ſpeake the truth freely and voluntarily: otherwiſe at his
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:17938:42"/>
owne perill be it. For if either his arme, or his legge, or any other ioint be broken in the Rack, as it happeneth to diuers, ſo that hee chance to dye thereof (for more gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than ſo, they mean not to deal with him) let him blame no man but himſelfe. For they think that after they haue giuen him this faire warning, they are now diſcharged in conſcience both before God and man, and therefore are guiltleſſe, what harm ſoeuer come vnto him by meanes of the Rack, yea though he dye thereon as innocent as the child newly borne. After this, with ſharp rebukes and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing words, they command that the party bee ſtripped ſtarke naked, be it hee or ſhee, yea though it were one wel knowne to be the moſt honeſt and chaſte mayden or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron in all the city (as they bee neuer lightly without ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſuch in this their ſhambles) whoſe grief I dare wel ſay is not halfe ſo great in reſpect of any torments that preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they endure, as it is to be ſeen naked in ſuch a preſence, and of ſuch maner of perſons. For theſe wicked Villaines without any regard of humanity or honeſty, (which mee thinkes they ſhould ſomwhat reſpect, if it were but onely for their long beardes and ſide-gownes, with the name &amp; countenance of grauity and holines which they pretend, ſeeing that neither for Gods ſake, nor for the honeſty of the good and godly matrons and ſober maydens they wil not forbear one iote of that barbarous impudency) cauſe them firſt to be ſtripped into their ſhirts and ſmockes, and then out of them alſo welnigh (ſauing your reuerence) vp to their priuities, drawing on a cloſe linnen breech, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that make bare their arms alſo to their ſhoulders, as tho the Wrench and Rack, wherewith they are about to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, were not able to pearce their linne, or as tho their linnen breeches would more manerly couer thoſe partes, which they may bee aſhamed to diſcouer, then could their ſide-ſhirts or ſmockes.

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:17938:42"/>
though the poore wretches that ſuffer this, buy it both with paine and ſhame enough full dearely. The which thing ſurely is a good occaſion, why that after this ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and impudent dealing of theſe Fathers of the faith bee once noyſed and bruted abroad, they whoſe wiues or daughters eyther haue already, or may hereafter fall, or preſently are in this the holy Fathers foule handling, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering this ſhamefull villany, ſhould be vtterly abhorred and ſhunned of all the people whereſoeuer they goe, aſwell of Papiſts as of other, becauſe they ought to eſteeme the honeſty and chaſtity of their daughters and wiues aboue all other treaſures.

               <p>When the parties are thus ſtripped out of all their clothes, be it he or ſhee, into their linnen breeches, they ſignifie unto the Tormenter by ſome token, in what ſort they would haue the party ordered. For this is one other peece of their art, to talke by ſignes and watch-words like to pedlers french, wherein from the higheſt to the loweſt all the pack of them in that curſed Court, as well Iacke layler, as my Lord Iudge, can vnderſtand one another very readily. As for the torments by the which theſe holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vſe to bring men to their beliefe, as they be many in number, ſo in ſorts they are ſundry, yea moe by a great many than any poore ſoule is able to endure, or can come to the knowledge of.</p>
               <p>But the moſt vſuall be the <hi>Ieobit</hi> and <hi>Pullie</hi> with <hi>water,</hi>

Being thus bound to the Racke,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:17938:43"/>
they begin yet once againe to perſwade with him: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the binding together of his hands, they alſo cauſe his thumbes to be bound with ſome ſmaller line drawne very ſtraite, and ſo faſten both the lines that tye both his hands and thumbes to a certaine <hi>Pullie</hi> which hangeth on the <hi>Ieobit.</hi> Then knocke they great and heauy bolts vpon his heeles, if the party haue none already, or elſe hang be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both his feete vpon thoſe bolts which he hath, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine waights of Iron, at the firſt time but of fiue pound, and ſo hoyſe him vp from the ground. Whiles the poore wretch hangeth in this plight, they fall to their perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons once againe, commanding the hangman to hoyſe him vp on high to the very beame, till his head touch the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</hi> Then cryeth the Inquiſitor and the Clerk vpon him to confeſſe ſomewhat, promiſing to let him downe out of hand, if ſo be that he willbe ruled: otherwiſe, they tell him that he is like to tarry there till hee would be glad to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare whatſoeuer they would haue him. After he hath hung thus a good ſpace, and will grant nothing, they command him to be let downe, and twice ſo much Iron more to bee layde on his heeles, and ſo hoyſed vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine one inch higher if it may be, threatning him that he ſhall dye none other death, except he declare vnto them the truth in ſuch matters as they demand of him; &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore charge the hangman to let him vp and downe, that the waight of the Iron hanging at his heeles, may rent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ioynt in his body from other. At which intolerable paines piercing all the parts of his body, if the party ſhrike or cry out (as he hath good cauſe to doe) they are as loude on the other ſide, roaring and yelling vpon him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the truth then, or elſe they tell him hee ſhall come downe with a vengeance. Neither will they onely ſay ſo, but the party ſhall find it ſo. For if hee continue in the ſame mind, they goe on forward as faſt in their mad moodes, and bid the hang man to ſlip the ropes ſuddenly, that he may fall downe with a ſway, and in the halfe way
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:17938:43"/>
to ſtop, &amp; giue him the <hi>Strappado:</hi> which being done with a trice, all his whole body is out of frame, both armes, <note place="margin">The Strap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pado.</note> ſhoulders, back, legs, and all the reſt of his ioynts, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the exceeding great waight hanging at his heeles, and the ſudden ſway tearing each part from other. And yet here is no ho with them neither. For renuing their exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and threats, if he will not yield vnto them, they cauſe more Iron to bee added the third time: ſo that the poore wretch being in that pittifull plight, halfe dead and more, is by their commandement heaued vp once againe; and to mend the matter withall, beſides the extreamity of his griefes, they begin to raile vpon him, calling him <hi>Dog</hi> and <hi>Heretike</hi> that will ſtand ſo obſtinately in concealing the truth, and at the length tell him that he is very like there to make his end. Now if the pittifull creature in the midſt of his pangs call vpon Chriſt (as for the moſt part, all that are thus perſecuted for his truths ſake doe) that he would vouchſafe to ayde and aſſiſt him, thus miſerably tormented, and almoſt ſlain for his ſake, then fall they to mocking and deriding him, ſaying, <hi>Ieſu Chriſt, Ieſu Chriſt.</hi> Let <hi>Ieſu Chriſt</hi> alone, and tell vs the truth. What a crying out vpon <hi>Christ</hi> makeſt thou? confeſſe what we aske thee, and make vs no more ado. In much like ſort (as a man may eaſily iudge) were the blaſphemous ſpeeches of the Iewes againſt our Sauiour himſelfe, ſaying: <hi>Behold he calleth for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias. He truſteth in God, let him deliuer him now if he will: for he</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Math. 27. Pſal. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>calleth himſelfe the Sonne of God.</hi> Which is a true token and moſt euident argument, that it is Chriſt againſt whom they kicke and make all this broyle: whoſe name when it is called vpon by ſuch as ſuffer for his ſake, they doe ſo ill digeſt, that they can hardly abide to heare him named, or once ſpoken of. But if the party at any time deſire to bee let downe, promiſing to tell them ſomewhat, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it indeede, that is the very ready way to make him be worſe handled than before, becauſe they thinke that now he beginneth onely to broach his matters. For as
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17938:44"/>
ſoone as this tale is at an end, they begin afreſh to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, to threate, to rack him, giuing charge to hale him vp, and to let him downe againe in ſuch ſort as is before declared. This execution for the moſt part continueth from nine of the clock in the morning till high noone, or an houre after: and when they are diſpoſed to leaue him and let him downe for that time, the Inquiſitours for a policie ask the layler if his other inſtruments be in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, to put the partie in feare of further torment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dead with theſe alreadie. The layler anſwereth that they are readie, but that hee hath not brought them with him. Then ſee (ſay they) that they be made readie againſt to morrow, and looke that nothing bee wanting. For wee will try one way or another, whether wee can get the truth out of this fellow, yea or no; and ſo depart, giuing theſe and ſuch like words of comfort to the poore wretch that lieth diſtracted in euery limme: <hi>How now Sirrha? how like ye this geare? haue ye enough of it, or no?</hi> Well, ſee yet betwixt this and to morrow, that ye call your wits to you, and bethink your ſelfe what to ſay, or elſe looke to die none other death but this: and yet we promiſe thee that all this is but a fleabiting in compariſon of that which thou art like to feele; and ſo depart. Then beginneth the Iayler to play the bone-ſetter ſo well as he can, and to put his armes and leges in their right ioynts again: and putting on his clothes, bringeth him back to his priſon, or carrieth him rather, hauing neuer a leg to ſtand vpon, yea ſomtime draggeth him by the armes or legges too-too pitifully: and then forſooth for faſhion ſake, and to ſeeme ſomewhat mercifull (minding in deede no ſuch matter) telleth him that a Surgeon ſhall be ſent for if neede bee.</p>
               <p>But if they bee determined to put the partie no more to the racke, then within two or three dayes they ſend for him forth againe into the Audience, and prouide ſo, that in the way from the priſon, as hee paſſeth by the place where the rack-ſtocke ſtandeth &amp; is commonly occupied,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17938:44"/>
the hangman ſhall ſtand for the nonce, to ſhew himſelfe in the ſelfe ſame likenes of a Diuel, the which I haue before deſcribed, that the party in paſſing by, may haue a ſight of him, and thereby bee occaſioned the more to remember his former torments. Who comming into the Court, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> the <hi>Ordinarie</hi> and the <hi>Clerke</hi> readie ſet each man in his place; which after their maner fall in hand with him, ſometime by perſwaſions, and ſometime by earneſt intreatie, mouing him to vtter ſomewhat. At which time if they prevaile not, neyther can get any thing out of him, they cauſe him to bee carried to priſon againe. But if hee declare any thing, they preſſe him the more, and ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it may bee his hap to diſcloſe, that it may chance to purchaſe him the Racke once more, vpon hope of getting ſome greater matters at his hands. Marrie if they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued before to put the party to the Rack once again, then about 3. dayes after his laſt being there, when the ache in his ioints is moſt grieuous and painfull vnto him, they ſend for him againe to come before them; and what with earneſt entreatie and with terrible threats, they labour to haue him ſhriue him ſelfe of all his opinions and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies, and to appeach as well ſuch perſons with whom hee hath had conference in ſuch matters, as alſo all other whom hee knoweth to bee of the ſame minde and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Otherwiſe, they will him to make himſelfe readie for the Racke: wherein if it bee his chaunce either to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in any part of his bodie, or to receiue his deaths wound, let him blame no man but himſelf. And if he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtil the ſame man that firſt he was, the keeper is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that once again he prouide the Rack, all the afor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid parties taking their places as before to ſee him ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of his clothes, and put to it once again in ſuch ſort as is before declared, or ſomwhat worſe, after this maner.</p>
               <p>The partie hauing his hands bound behinde him and hanging at the Pullie, they bind both his thighes together with ſmall, but very ſtrong cords, and ſo in like maner his
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17938:45"/>
legges about the calfe or mid-leg. Then put they betwixt the cords and his legs a ſhort peece of wood, wherewith they wreſt the ſtrings ſo ſtiffe till they bee ſo deepe ſunke into his fleſh, that they are paſt ſight: a very extreme and a terrible torment, and much worſe then any that as yet hee hath endured. In this plight the poore ſoule lieth by the ſpace of two or three houres, abiding the Inquiſitours goodwill &amp; pleaſure: who neuertheles ceaſe not to moleſt and trouble him all this while, either by queſtioning, or entreating, or perſwading or flouting &amp; mocking him, or diſquieting him one way or another. Or in ſtead hereof, they practiſe, as they thinke beſt, another kind of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: which, albeit it bee vſed vpon offenders in other places aſwell as in this, yet for one eſpeciall point of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie added by them, we may iuſtly aſcribe it to their holy Court as a deuice of their owne. The name of it, as it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called, is <hi>Burri</hi> or <hi>Aſelli,</hi> and the maner of it is this. <note place="margin">Burri or Aſelli.</note> There is a bench made of maſſie timber, wrought ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hollow on the vpper part like a trough, ſo large that a man may lie open in it on his back; and thereabouts as his midriffe lieth, there is a ſharpe bar going croſſe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart, whereon a mans back reſteth that it cannot ſettle to the bottome, becauſe the partie ſhould find the leſſe eaſe, where otherwiſe he might ſtay or reſt his back againſt the bottome of the trough: being alſo placed in ſuch ſort, that his heeles ſhall lie higher than his head. When the partie is laied hereon, his armes, thighes, and legs are bound with very ſtiffe and ſmall cords about the middeſt of the maine bone, which afterwards they ſtraine with certaine ſtiffe wreſting ſtickes or truncheons put vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the cordes, till the cords be ſettled downe within the fleſh, and pearce almoſt to the very bone, inſomuch that they bee cleane out of ſight, and then commeth in this <note place="margin">The Torment by water &amp; the laund.</note> deuice of their owne addition: Firſt, they take a very fine and a cloſe laund or linnen cloth, and ouerſpread the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties mouth therewith as hee lieth vpright, ſo as it may
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17938:45"/>
ſtop his noſtrils alſo, that when the water is poured into his mouth, he ſhould take in no ayre at his noſe. Then take they a certaine quantity of water, ſo much as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the Inquiſitours to appoint, which they poure vpon the cloth, not by drops, but in the maner of a long ſtreame like a thread: which having ſomewhat a high fall, beareth downe with it the fine linnen cloth into the furtheſt part of his throat. And here, whoſo ſhould behold the poor wretch in this pitifull caſe, would thinke him, I dare ſay, to bee in as great an agony as any man is at the giuing vp of the ghoſt. For in all other torments a man may haue li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to draw his breath: onely here he cannot, by reaſon that the water ſtoppeth his mouth, and the cloth his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils, ſo that when they plucke it out of the bottome of his throat (as manie times they doe, to ſee whether hee will anſwer to their demands, yea or no) the cloth is ſo wet with water and bloud together, that a man would thinke the verie intralles would come out of his bodie. And thus the partie continueth in theſe pangs ſo long as pleaſeth them, with promiſes of ſharper ſauces than any that hee hath taſted as yet, and ſo they ſend him to priſon againe.</p>
               <p>But if theſe good Fathers be diſpoſed to deal with him further, &amp; proceed to other greater tortures (for their luſt is law in this their lawleſſe Court, where right &amp; reaſon can take no place) then within a month or two vnder or ouer, as they think beſt, the party is once againe brought to the rack, ſome twice, thrice, foure, fiue or ſix times, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in entreated eaſily or roughly as it pleaſeth the Inquiſitors to appoint. And ſome are tormented in another ſort, that is no where els vſed but in this holy Houſe, the which is termed by fire, the deſcription wherof is ſhorter to ſhew <note place="margin">The Torment by fire.</note> than the reſt, but the paines and cruelty, as great altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They take a charcole pan of Iron full of hot coles, which they ſetiuſt ouer againſt the ſoles of a mans feete before he goe to the foreſaid rack, and to the end that the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17938:46"/>
fire might haue the more force to burne them, they baſte them with lard or bacon.</p>
               <p>Thus after they haue occupyed and vnedged all their tooles one after another, and are paſt hope of hauing any thing at the parties hands, they reſpite him for a ſeaſon to take his reſt, and after a while call him before them againe, and fall to queſtioning with him, inquiring and requiring many things in a farre other order than they vſed before, in ſuch tearms as euery word may miniſter matter enough to quarrell at. The queſtions alſo are framed ſo cunningly and <hi>Point de vice</hi> (for this is their onely ſhift that neuer fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them) that by granting one thing, they muſt needes grant another, and deny the contrary to that. For theſe Fathers are paſſing good Logicians, and maruellous ſubtil Sophiſters, their crafts-maſters I warrant them, which notwithſtanding that they are dayly in vre with ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, will not ſticke to take a little paines, and vpon ſtudy to coyne caſes and queſtions for the nonce: which to help their memory withall, leſt when the time commeth that they ſhould haue vſe thereof, they might forget them, are written and laid open before them: ſo that if the party, when any thing is demanded of him, be neuer ſo little retchleſſe, it is not poſſible for him to auoyde them, but that one way or other they will ouertake him. The onely helpe for a man therefore in this caſe is, to haue a perfect remembrance of all ſuch things as he hath deliuered vp in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hands: for it is but in vaine for him to craue to haue them read vnto him, becauſe either they will not grant him that; or if they doe, yet will they read much amiſſe. Wherefore if he doe miſtruſt his owne memory, let his anſwer be this, that he wholly referreth them to his former doings and ſayings, and in any caſe auoyde reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with them. Or if by their ſubtilties of Logicke, they inferre any thing thereupon, which either he knew not of, or elſe neuer affirmed, let him take heed in any caſe how he anſwereth it, leſt either they entrap him in ſome new
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17938:46"/>
matter, or elſe driue him to the denying of Gods truth moſt wickedly. And the readieſt way will be, to cut off all their queſtions with a quicke and a round anſwer, and to tell them plainly that he was neuer ſet to ſchoole in all his life to learne theſe quiddities in argument, nor exerciſed in any manner of diſputation. For theſe fellowes are ſo cunning herein, and ſo full of interrogations and ſtrange deuices, beſides, ſo troubleſome therewithall, and ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate, that many times they will get that out of a man by theſe meanes, when all the racking in the world will doe no good.</p>
               <p>As at <hi>Siuil</hi> not long agone, they apprehended a certaine godly Matron, whoſe husband they had burned a little before, and ſo made her a widow. But becauſe her confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while ſhe was on the racke, and there tormented moſt cruelly, was by their owne decrees inſufficient either to condemne her to the ſtake, or to confiſcate her goods ſuch as they were, and yet, if they could but get onely thus much out of her, that ſhe knew full well that the Church of Rome had determined clean contrary to that which ſhe affirmed, this ſhould be ſufficient cauſe to make her to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit that poore remnant of her riches that ſhe had to keep her ſelfe withall in her widdow-hood, though poorely (God knows) they did rather compell her by their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, than compaſſe it by their Sophiſtry, that ſhe was content to ſay ſo much. For perceiuing that elſe they would neuer make an end thus to moleſt and trouble her, Indeed (ſaith ſhe) I confeſſe that the Church of Rome hath ſo determined, and therefore I pray you enter in mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to be ſo, and let me depart quietly; and afterward as you ſhall ſee cauſe, determine what ſhall become of me or mine at your pleaſure.

               </argument>
               <p>WHen the extreamity of torments with the ſubtill practices before expreſſed will doe no good, but that the party conſtantly endureth the one, and anoydeth the other very cunningly, then fall theſe good Fathers to other farre better fetches to their thinking, wherein who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is able in a deuice to go beyond the reſt, is counted a chief Champion, and therfore hath yielded vnto him the preheminence of place aboue other in this holy Houſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore paſt all hope of hauing any thing at the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties hands by foule meanes, they deuiſe to compaſſe him by faire, ſhewing themſelues very mild and mercifull, and ſo affectioned, as though the miſery and affliction which they ſee the other in, went to their own hearts. They weep with him, they entreat him, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort him, they giue him their aduice, and deuiſe for him ſome ſecret meanes to rid him out of his miſery, making him beleeue that they tell him that in ſecret, which they would ſcarce tell to their owne fathers, or brethren, or deareſt friend that they haue aliue, with many other like words. And this they vſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to doe to ſuch as bee the ſimpler ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but ſpecially to women, which for the moſt part are not ſo cunning to diſcerne forced and fayned tears. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Inquiſitors begin to vſe them ſo gently, and to proffer them ſuch kindneſſe, then let the party ſee to himſelfe warily, and learne betimes to diſcerne wherea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts they goe in vſing ſuch flattering ſpeeches, aſſuring himſelfe, that they are but faire baites put vpon ſharpe hookes: whereof I will of a number report vnto you one example.</p>
               <p>The very firſt time that they began to burne for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at <hi>Siuill,</hi> (which was diuerſe yeares ſince,) among certaine other that were for the ſame cauſe apprehended,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:17938:47"/>
there was a very godly Matrone, with two of her owne Daughters and one of her ſiſters children, who hauing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all theſe aforeſaid pikes with manlike conſtancy, were preſſed very ſore to betray ſome of their brethren, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially one to appeach another. One of the Inquiſitors counterfaiting a maruellous kind of compaſſion towards theſe ſilly women, ſent for one of the daughters to come vnto him. And when ſhee was come, they two being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone together, hee began to make a long ſpeech vnto her in way of conſolation, and afterwardes ſent her to priſon againe. This he vſed to doe diuers times and vpon ſeuerall dayes, alwayes towards the euening, and there held her a great while, declaring vnto her, how great a griefe it was to him to ſee her in theſe troubles: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal would interlace ſome other pleaſant communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more familiarly many times, than did well become him. Which tended to none other end (as it fell out in proofe) but to perſwade the mayden, that he of very good affection ſorrowed to ſee her in ſuch diſtreſſe; that in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſo fatherly aduiſe her what the beſt were both for her ſelf &amp; her mother &amp; ſiſter to do in this caſe, ſhe ſhould wholly commit her ſelfe and her cauſe to his ordering. After that two or three dayes had been thus ſpent in ſuch like conference and familiar communication, weeping (as it were) ouer her for the miſery which ſhe was in, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther many moe arguments and tokens of compaſsion, wherin he vttered the affections and ſorrowes of his heart for her pitifull eſtate, with often proteſtation of his good will and beſt furtherance to his power: after all theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices (I ſay) when the wilie Wolfe was ſure that the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſheepe was within his reach, he beginneth to perſwade with her to diſcloſe vnto him the truth of the matter, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel in ſuch things as touched her mother, ſiſter and aunt, as any other that were not as yet apprehended, binding himſelfe by an oath, that if ſhe would ſo do, and diſcloſe to him whatſoeuer ſhe knew concerning theſe matters, hee
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:17938:48"/>
himſelfe would ſtop all theſe gappes well enough, and find a meanes that they ſhould all depart home againe quietly to their own houſes. The maiden being but ſimple witted, was ſoone induced to credit the faire promiſes and allurenents of this flattering Father, and thereupon beginneth to open vnto him certaine points of religion whereof they were wont to conferre among themſelues, in maner almoſt, as if one ſhould giue holy things to a dogge, or caſt pearles before a ſwine. The Inquiſitour hauing gotten this thred by the end, laboured to vnwind the whole clew, and therefore calling in the maiden many times before him, to the end that her depoſitions might bee entred by order of law, made her beleeue that hee would take it vp and end it ſo reaſonably, that ſhe ſhould receiue no manner of harme thereby, and in the laſt day of hearing made a repetition vnto her of all his former promiſes, as to ſet her at liberty againe, and ſuch like. But when the time came that ſhe looked verily for the performance thereof, there was no ſuch matter, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe my Lord the Inquiſitour and his adherents per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing how this deuice had brought ſomwhat to light, which al their extremities otherwiſe could in no caſe doe, to the end to make her confeſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the damoſell through very extremity of pangs and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, was driuen to betray her owne naturall mother, and ſiſters and diuers others, that were thereupon imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately apprehended, and afterward put to the torments, and at the length ſent to the fire.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the ſelfe ſame maiden within a while after plaied a notable part in teſtimony of her beliefe. For when ſhee was brought vp vnto the ſolemne ſcaffold with other
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:17938:48"/>
ofher companions there to be ſeene of all the people, and euery one to heare ſentence of death pronounced vpon them, as ſhee returned thence to her place againe; hauing heard her iudgement, which was to bee burned, ſhee came to her Aunt who had beene her Schoolemiſtreſſe, and taught her her catechiſme and beliefe (for the profeſſion whereof ſhee ſhould preſently bee executed) and with a bold courage without change of countenance, bending her head downeward maidenly, gaue her moſt hearty thankes for that exceding great benefit in taking the paines to inſtruct her, and praied pardon at her hands if at any time ſhe had offended her, for that ſhe was now at the point of taking her death, and departing this life. Whom her Aunt on the other ſide comforted as ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, willing her to bee of good cheare, and to let nothing diſquiet her, for ſhe hoped in God that ſhe ſhould be with Chriſt ere it were long. And this did ſhe in the preſence &amp; hearing of all the people, but ſpecially of all thoſe of the holy Houſe and their adherents. This Aunt of hers was the ſelfe ſame woman, which a yeare or two before being mad had detected the whole congregation to the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, whereof I made mention before: who being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to her former wits againe by the goodnes of God, ſo well as the reliques of her diſeaſe would let her, did now both confeſſe his truth, and for the ſame endured moſt horrible and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe paſſing excellency of theſe practiſes which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently I entend to diſcouer, is ſuch, that they rather deſerue to haue ſome ſpeciall place by themſelues, then to be thruſt in heere confuſedly among theſe other groſſe and common deuices. For they doo as far paſſe all the other that haue been ſpoken of heretofore, as there is difference
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:17938:49"/>
in dignitie betwixt a Court of Pipowders and the high Court of Parliament. The firſt whereof in order as it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out, and the moſt myſticall (and I beleeue as beneficiall to their boxe as all the reſt) is the abuſe of their ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as they terme it) of Confeſſion, which by their owne decretals is no ſmall offence. But all is law in this holy Houſe (as I ſaid before) whatſoeuer they liſt. Their deucie is this: Whenſoeuer any of the priſoners beginneth to be but a little crazie, they aske him whether hee bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to go to holy ſhrift. The which is done for two eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall conſiderations. The one is, to proue whether he like well of their holy confeſſion, yea or no. The other, to ſee if perchance he will be perſwaded to ſay ſomwhat vnder <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicite,</hi> either touching himſelfe or any other, that this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſe may bee ſet on work. If the party bee willing, at hand is Sir Iohn and a Clerke behind him with pen and ink left behind the priſon dore, &amp; ſo the ghoſtly father fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to his <hi>Confitetor:</hi> in proceſſe whereof he examineth the ſicke man firſt generally, &amp; then ſpecially, whether he hold any of Luthers articles, chiefely in this or that article, or haue at any time conferred with any other concerning the like cauſes: finally, of whom &amp; by what occaſion he heard them, &amp;c. willing him boldly to confeſſe it &amp; to feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, neither to think any ſuch villany to be in him as to reueale it, ſaying that hee hath authority immediatly from the high Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners to abſolue him of all, ſo that he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his conſcienc: with other ſuch like talke to the ſame effect. Now if the party follow him ſo far that hee begin to confeſſe ought, then is he ſurely caught. For when he hath poured out al, &amp; ſaid what he can ſay in theſe caſes (though he do it through the earneſt &amp; wicked perſwaſions of the prieſt) then doth he charge him further to confeſs the ſame before a Notary, otherwiſe he tells him that his abſolution is nothing auailable vnto him. And if the party yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him ſo much, &amp; be content ſo to do, then the clerk, who lieth lurking not far off, is ſtraightway ſent for, and ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:17938:49"/>
this matter diſpatched. But if he refuſe, either miſtruſting him altogether, or elſe halfe in doubt to credite him, yet is he no leſſe in dangered by diſcloſing it to the Prieſt, than if he had confeſſed it before a Notary. For this kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion is not right auricular, but all is done aloud, by meanes that the crafty confeſſor repeateth the words after him, and ſo driueth the party to anſwer him almoſt in the ſelf ſame note: who knoweth not nor feareth any ſuch matter, that there lurketh any body <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Neither doth this good ghoſtly Father either fear excommunication, or feele any trouble in his conſcience, for reuealing his ghoſtly ſonnes confeſſion, both becauſe he is perſwaded, that a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle loud ſpeaking, and in ſomewhat a higher note than the ſecrets of confeſſion would wel allow, is not to bee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted any diſcloſing at all; &amp; for that, whatſoeuer he did, was done in the ſeruice and behalfe of the holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Iulianus Apoſtata</hi> (as hiſtories of very good credite doe report) ſpoiled the Chriſtians of all that they had, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured his theeuery with a falſe gloſe vpon the Goſpel; whereas Chriſt commanded all his Diſciples to loue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, and to bee careleſſe for things of this world. At another time hee perſecuted them moſt cruelly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them to patience, ſaying, that Chriſt had giuen them an example. And no doubt, theſe holy Fathers haue borrowed one of their deuices of him. For when they ſee any conſtatly &amp; like a good Chriſtian man to continue aſwel in his faith towards God, as charity towards his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they hedge him in with this argument: Now ſurely <hi>Sir,</hi> you are but a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

before the Ethnike Magiſtrates, and examined whether they confeſſed Chriſt or no, anſwered plainely that they did: and being further demanded, what fellowes &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions they had, would tell the truth at the firſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>th you profeſſe your ſelues to be followers of them &amp; their examples, in like ſort ſhould you confeſſe of your ſelues and of your fellowes. And this is their goodly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they make. In very deed <hi>Iulianus Apostata</hi> ſpake truth, that Chriſtians in the time of affliction ſhould not be wauering, nor giuen to the gathering of theſe earthly treaſures. Euen ſo (ſay the Inquiſitors) ſhould a Chriſtian man comming before a temporall Iudge, and there exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of his beliefe, yield a plaine and euident declaration of the ſame. But they lye both of them by their leaue, when they ſay that the Chriſtians in thoſe dayes did of like zeale betray their brethren vnto the Ethnike Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as they did make open confeſſion of their faith: for that were flat againſt the rule of charity. And therefore it is a plaine matter, that in all other things the Inquiſitours are altogether as bad as euer <hi>Iulianus</hi> was, becauſe they vſe the ſelfe ſame reaſons that he did, and all to one effect: that is to ſay, to make waſte in the Church of Chriſt, by cutting downe the branches thereof, making but a ieſt of the lawes of true Religion.</p>
               <p>As there was once an Inquiſitour, and one of the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt of them, whom it ſhall not be greatly amiſſe to touch by name, becauſe if his friends hap to reade this, they may acknowledge it to be true that I will report of him. His name was <hi>Iohn Gonſalue,</hi> borne at <hi>Siuil,</hi> and Biſhop of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racon.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Biſhop of <hi>Tarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.</hi>
                  </note> It was his common ſaying (which I beleeue other of his fellowes learned of him) ſpeaking of ſuch as were brought before him for the profeſſion of Chriſt, that it was a wonderfull thing to conſider, how firmely theſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes haue ingrauen in the tables of their hearts this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: <hi>Thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour as thy ſelfe,</hi> which will neuer be brought to confeſſe of their fellowes, till
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17938:50"/>
they be almoſt torne in peeces with torments, and yet can ye not get it out of ſome of them by theſe meanes neither: ſuch notable teſtimonies hath true religion oftentimes, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of thoſe that are her deadly enemies. For the law of God concerning both the Tables, is perfectly written and ſealed in the hearts of true Chriſtians, and the print of this ſeale of Gods law is not elſewhere to be found but in theſe onely. But all the Lawes of the fleſh are ſigned with this marke: <hi>To day mine owne man, and yours to morrow.</hi> And ſurely, me thinketh, a Chriſtian Biſhop ought to haue beene very much aſhamed to bee ſo blind and ignorant therein, and not alone ſo to be, but thereunto to adde ſuch blaſphemy beſides.</p>
               <p>The ſelfe-ſame Biſhop (ſeeing we haue begun to talke of him) was ſent from the Kings Court to <hi>Siuil</hi> to be one of the Commiſſioners in the Inquiſition there, about two or three yeares before: at what time ſo great a multitude of the faithfull were firſt eſpyed, of the which euen till this day, at certaine times appointed there be diuers ſent to the fire. For all his Predeceſſours were not worth a ſtrawe in compariſon of him, neither halfe ſo ſtout as he, nor ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in bringing their matters about as was this one man, but ſpecially ſuch as concerned the holy Inquiſition. For vntill this time there was neuer an able man, that was thought ſo prouident as to preuent ſo great a miſchiefe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hapned, or otherwiſe able to vphold the Church of Rome drooping, as it were, by meanes thereof, and in danger of ruine. But for any other good qualities that were in him to commend him to this Office, or ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to diſcharge it, I report me to himſelfe, I report mee to them that choſe him to this roome, yeal report me to all that euer knew him, if there were any thing in him at all that might preferre him, ſpecially and aboue his fellowes, either apparance of learning, or skill in Diuinity, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, or any great reading of the ancie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Fathers or the late Writers (whoſe authority the

Church hath worthily in great eſtimation) or if hee were greatly ſeene in matters of faith, whereof they tearme themſelues the Inquiſitors and Iudges, as it were, both of <hi>oyer</hi> and <hi>terminer,</hi> in theſe caſes: to be ſhort, if there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny knowne and approoued godlineſſe of life and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in this man: wherein the whole packe of them flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelues ſo much, that they arrogate vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues a very gay and glorious title thereby, but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was more cruell and vnnaturall, and ſomewhat more ſlie in the deuices and practices of the Inquiſition than the reſt were. In reſpect whereof, he obtained both a diſcharge from his ſeruice, and a fat Biſhopricke beſides in recompence of his trauailes, and partly in conſideration that he was an old forworne ſoldiour; and hauing now good leaſure, like a wicked impe of Rome, returned to his old occupation againe. At the ſelf-ſame time whiles he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in commiſſion at <hi>Siuil,</hi> ſo many were apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for profeſſing the Goſpel, that he was driuen to beſtow ſome of them in his owne lodging, becauſe all the priſons in the towne were not able to receiue them, the number was ſo great. Yet his Reuerend Lordſhip wanted neyther time nor leaſure to take his pleaſure abroad, and to row vpon the riuer in Barges titled with purple and ſilke, with ſuch preparation as had better beſeem'd one of <hi>Sardanapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> ſchollers, than any ſober man or Chriſtian Biſhop: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with <hi>Muſicians,</hi> but not with the <hi>Muſes,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing a very great traine after him beſides, and ſo paſſing to his garden adioyning thereunto, all the whole people ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing vpon him, and running in heapes and throngs to ſee this ſight. In very deed theſe triumphs &amp; iollities were not greatly out of the way for him and his mates to delight in, their matters being in ſuch plight as they were; and the Church of God, whereunto he was a profeſſed enemy, ſo full of troubles, vexations, and afflictions. But to returne to their practices againe.</p>
               <p>Whenſoeuer theſe good gentlemen are deſirous to

learne out a certaintie of ſuch as liue altogether in one priſon, (whom they ſuſpect to haue ſome conference in matters touching ſaluation, either by way of exhortation, or by comforting &amp; confirming one another in the faith, being in ſo great miſery as they are) they ſend in a <hi>Flie</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them (as the priſoners vſe to tearme him) whom the Inquiſitors caſt in priſon craftily and for a colour, to mark euery mans talke, who after two or three dayes that hee hath once crept into their acquaintance, will begin afarre off to offer ſome talke in matters of Religion, making as though he would be glad either to teach others, or to learn himſelfe, and by theſe ſubtill deuices many of the ſimple ſort are ſoone beguiled. Wherfore let euery man take heed after this faire warning, that he bee not ouerlight of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite in truſting ſtrangers too far (I meane ſuch as are put in priſon with them,) hauing no manner of acquaintance with them before. And to the intent that they may know ſuch a <hi>Flie</hi> the better, I will giue them one ſure token: to wit, he will commonly be the firſt that will offer talke, and pretend a zeale towards true Religion, both beſide time and without occaſion: and then ſhall they doe well to let him preach alone till his chaps ake, giuing him neuer a word. For if he chance to get any thing out of any of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes that he longed for, ſo ſoone as the Iayler commeth to viſite his priſoners at his accuſtomable houres, hee is ſtraight-way in hand with him to craue a day of hearing for him, as the manner is that ſometimes the priſoners will ſue for. But ſo ſoone as he is out, I warrant them, the reſt that tarry behind, ſhall ſhortly after feele the fruites of his fellowſhip, little to their liking. A maruailous matter, doubtleſs, that men ſhould be ſo diuelliſhly bent, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for a ſmall gaine of a little money, to ſerue in ſuch offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo much to their owne hindrance, that to obtaine their purpoſe they ſticke not to lye in priſon with others bound and chayned as they be, by the ſpace of two or three moneths, and then to endure all the other miſeries
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17938:52"/>
incident thereunto, as hunger, filth, ſtench, which the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priſoners can in no caſe away withall by their willes, and yet can theſe men with all their hearts. Beſides this (a more wonderfull thing to conſider) they wil ſo paſſe from one priſon to another, that they are no ſooner out of one, but by and by they willbee in another, and ſo in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and third, &amp;c. and be content to endure the ſame extreamities twice, thrice, or foure ſundry and ſeuerall times, yea, all their life long to feede vpon theſe diſhes of dainties. And when this good fellow is out of priſon, and come before them to yeeld account of his office, he doth not onely declare what he hath heard the priſoners ſay, but alſo what countenance they made him when hee called theſe matters of Religion into queſtion, and how they tooke it, whether as liking or miſliking therewithall, or what opinion he hath of them, though they neuer anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him one word. And this mans accuſation is of as great force as the ſtrongeſt and moſt allowable witnes that is or can be, and is without all exception, be he neuer ſo meane a man either in calling, or credit, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon reputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: yea tho he be but a lakes-farmer, &amp; ſerue in his place for a ſmal reward, yet is he reputed a worthy member for that purpoſe, well beſeeming ſuch a head as is that holy Houſe of theirs. It happeneth alſo many times, that ſome ſuch as are apprehended for Religion, fall into the company of ſome that are layd in for ſpeciall matters; who to curry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with the Inquiſitors, will villanouſly accuſe their fellowes whom they haue heard confer together in pure and ſound doctrine: and the teſtimony of ſuch perſons is of the greateſt credit that can be, and moſt highly eſteemed in their holy Houſe. For to the ſtate of the matter, or <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification</hi> as they tearme it, a great reſpect is to be had of the circumſtances; as the priſon, the perſon of the accuſer, and the party accuſed.</p>
               <p>Other <hi>Flies</hi> there be alſo which ſerue the holy Houſe to do the like feat abroad out of priſons, ſecretly and ſlily go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

about to compaſſe in by like wyles ſuch as are among the common people ſuſpected to be Lutherans; whereof ſome haue ſo good wings, that they will flye quite ouer the ſea into very farre countries to take ſuch as are content to leaue <hi>Spayne,</hi> and baniſh themſelues thence, to the end that they may liue the more ſafely in other places elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: ſuch is the earneſt zeale which theſe good Fathers haue both to the glory of God, and the health of mens ſoules. But to keep within the bounds of <hi>Spaine,</hi> &amp; to ſpeak onely of thoſe that flye about the Cities there where this holy Court is kept: there are a great ſort of <hi>ghostly Fathers,</hi> both Prieſts and Monkes, which are not behind with their parts in playing the <hi>Flies.</hi> To whom if a ſimple man, and one whom God hath ſent ſome light of his word vnto, doe chance to reſort, and in proceſſe of his confeſſion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his conſcience vnto them, eyther doubtingly, or elſe as only ready perſwaded, praying to be further inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or confirmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they labour not onely to quench that light which began to ſhine in his heart, but ſome of them are in hand with him, either by gentle entreaty, or ſometime by threatning him terribly, to the end to get him to goe to the holy Houſe there to accuſe himſelfe, promiſing him in the behalfe of the Lords the Inquiſitors, that he ſhall haue all fauour ſhewed him that may be: ſo that it commeth to paſſe many times, that the poore ſoules like ſilly ſheepe, will runne of their owne accord into the Wolues mouth to be torne in pieces and deuoured euery morſell.</p>
               <p>Another policy they haue which they put in practice likewiſe, more vnhoneſt by a great deale then this, which is alſo borrowed out of the Inquiſitours budgets. After they haue groped a mans conſcience that ſuſpecteth no ſuch treachery at a holy mans hand, ſpecially vnder their bleſſed <hi>Benedicite,</hi> they diſſemble the matter for that time without contrarying him, willing him to reſort vnto them the next day when they ſhall haue better leaſure to

hear him thoroughly, and to talke with him more freely in thoſe matters, and ſo ſend him away halfe ſhriuen, with halfe a confeſſion ilfauoredly cut off. His meaning is this, that when the party commeth the next morrow, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneth with him of the ſelfe ſame matters out of ſhrift, he may freely, and without danger of reuealing his confeſſion, complaine of him to the Inquiſitours: neyther doth this their purpoſe want his performance. This religious rout (forſooth) can choke with agnat, &amp; ſwallow downe a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell. And of ſuch crafty diſſemblers, diuers haue gotten this good by their trauail at the Inquiſitours hands, that if any thing eſcape them ignorantly or for want of heed ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king (as it happeneth many times) which had bin enough to haue heaped coales enow vpon anothers mans head, though the ſame things were proued againſt them ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly that they could not bee denied, yet can the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours bee content to winde vp ſuch matters and winke at them wiſely, accounting it a greater loſſe to forgoe the gaines that commeth trouling in by ſuch fellowes, than the ſpoile were worth that might bee gotten by taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage of them. Of the which ſort I could, if I were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, recken vp a great number by name, and ſure they wel deſerue it for their wicked dealings in this kind of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, to be ſo ſerued. But I meane to ſuppreſſe their names in conſideration of Gods great might and mercy, who may hereafter ſhew his fauourable countenance vnto them, and grant them grace to repent (as I know hee hath done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuers) and then ſhould I repent mee too late, that their names were made ſo infamous and execrable to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation by my meanes, though for their owne demerits. For truely a great number of theſe at the firſt knew the truth, yea ſome of them preached and taught it to others. But ſo ſoone as the ſtorme began to ariſe, and to trie each mans building vpon what foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſtood, on the rock or on the ſands, they thought it wiſedome for them to goe backe with that legge betimes. And being moreouer aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

that diuers had them in a great iealouſie for ſo doing, they imagined that they could not ſpunge out that ſtain by any other meanes, then if they ſhould become Promoters of ſuch as had bin their fellowes and companions tofore, &amp; ſo to become dayly Gueſts and ſtout Seruitours to this holy Houſe; and thus were perſwaded that they had taken a readie way to ſaue themſelues from the Inquiſitours. But what conſciences they carrie about within them, and what teſtimonies of the terrible iudgements of God prouided for them, they know beſt themſelues. It ſhall be ſufficient that I giue this <hi>Item</hi> by the way, to conſider that it is not any zeale in the Inquiſitours of the truth or cutting down hereſies, that moueth them to ſuch butcher-like ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as theſe (the which things both they pretend to doe, and the common people are like wiſe perſwaded of them) though we ſhould yeeld unto them ſo far that they bee er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous opinions which they correct ſo ſeuerely. For if it were ſo, then ſhould they not haue fauoured them that that haue done them ſo profitable ſeruice, and procured them ſo great gains as is ſaid before. Nay, all the zeal which they haue, is rather to fill the kings Treaſury &amp; their owne purſes. Yet if we reſpect the chiefe cauſe that moueth them to make ſo many poor innocents to be ſo miſerably puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed &amp; tormented, &amp; afterwards put to death, beſides their wiles, their guiles, their villanous breach of faith, and the diuelliſh deuices, by the which they doe procure their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, it is a ſting of <hi>Sathan</hi> himſelfe, who hath been a murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the children of God, the Father of lyes, and Patron of ſuch practices from the very beginning. For who is ſo blind but hee may eaſily eſpy, that this kinde of dealing can proceed of none other ſpirit? or who will be ſo blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous to refer it to the ſpirit of God as author thereof? Moreouer, one other good leſſon to the godly may be this, that they take diligent heed, whom they deale withall or admit into their company and familiar acquaintance, and not to truſt euery man.

                  <p>How the priſoners are dealt withall concerning their diet.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe priſoners within the Inquiſition, concerning their meate and drink &amp; other neceſſaries, are vſed in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects accordingly, as they are in credit with the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and the reſt of the officers of the holie Houſe. For the common eſtimation of them is no better than as they tearme them, <hi>dogges, heretickes, &amp;c.</hi> And yet they deale not with them altogether ſo well as moſt men will doo with their dogs, that doo them either ſeruice or pleaſure; but as men commonly vſe to intreat thoſe men, whom in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion of all humanity they terme dogges, and ſo eſteem of them. The diſcourſe whereof ſhall neither be altogether needeleſſe, nor impertinent in this place, becauſe it may do much good to the godly in many reſpects. Firſt to let them to vnderſtand the miſeries of their poore afflicted bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, that they may depart with ſome things for their reliefe, euery man according to his ability: Secondly, to put them in minde that the ſtaffe ſtandeth at their dores, and their turne therefore to bee the next, and that God hath reſerued them for a time, that they may follow the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this fight, and ſerue him in this moſt glorious kind of ſeruce, by confeſſing his holy name before the world. Thirdly and laſtly, that this horrible and moſt barbarous tyranny of theſe holy Fathers may appeare to all the world among other of their cruell prankes, which wee are to report of them, and of their bloudy butchery. Happy ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and thriſe happy was that preacher of <hi>Siuil, Conſtantine</hi> (for ſo <hi>Solon</hi> accounted him happy that had liued in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and eſtimation, and died accordingly); who being impriſoned (as I will declare hereafter) for the teſtimony of Chriſts Goſpell, taſting their tyranny and endleſſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, bewailed his own miſery, crying and lifting vp his voyce to God many times with theſe wordes: O my Lord God, were there in all the wide world no <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Another named <hi>Olmedo,</hi> a man ſingular both for vertue and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, falling likewiſe into the Inquiſitours hands for the ſelfe ſame cauſe that purchaſed vnto <hi>Constantine</hi> his death, firſt vpon his impriſonment fell ſicke, and afterward died amids the filth and ſtench of the priſon, and was wont to ſay in like ſort: O Lord God, doo with mee what thou wilt. Throw me headlong where thou wilt, ſo thou giue me not ouer to theſe men, whoſe entertainment is ſuch as may more rightly be termed a perpetuall Torture, then a place of Impriſonment. For firſt and formoſt, the place wherein each of them is ſhut vp ſeuerally, what with the <note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the priſons.</note> ſtraightnes thereof, and the euill aire, &amp; damp of the earth, if it be below, may more properly bee likened to a graue, then called a priſon: but if it be aloft, it is at the time of the yeare, by meanes of the extreme heate, more like a frying fornace. And in euery of theſe Holes, for the moſt part (ſpecially if their prizes bee ſo many that there bee moe ſeuerall perſons then ſeuerall roomes) two or three of them are thronged together, ſo that they haue no larger ſcope then to lay them down and reſt them in, ſaue onely a foote in compaſſe perhaps, which ſerueth for their ſtoole of eaſement to ſtand in, and by it a pitcher of of cold water to quench their thirſt. Neither in the day time is their light any more then may come in at a key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole, or at a little long rift no greater then a mans finger. Howbeit there bee certaine priſons that bee ſomwhat larger, but they are alſo more then ſomwhat coſtly, and doo ſerue for ſuch as are not greatly ſuſpected for religion. Againe, other there bee, leſſe in compaſſe then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and worſe a great deale to lie in, for that they are not a mans length: in ſo much that they which enter into one of them, lightly neuer go out till they be halfe rotten, or die of a conſumption. All which places and priſons are beſtowed according to the qualitie of the perſon, and

Out of the which there is deducted an allowance for his daily charges 30 <hi>dipondia,</hi> commonly called <hi>Maruedis,</hi> whereof 17. make a dutch batte 8 and a half, a french ſouſe, 10. a fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſtiuer, which amounteth in our reckning after the Engliſh rate, to 6. pence well nigh.

                  </gap>t if any of them be diſpoſed to exceede, &amp; haue any other dainties, he may at his pleaſure, ſo that he pay for it on his owne purſe. And yet they deale not ſo fauourably with euery ſort of priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but onely with ſuch, by whom they looke not to haue any bootie, being laid in but for trifling matters. For if they be ſuch priſoners, as they know by the information giuen in againſt them, likely to loſe all that euer they haue, they will not ſuffer them to exceed in ſuch ſort, but let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feed only vpon a little brown-bread, and a cruze of cold water, not ſuffering them in any caſe to haue any ſpeciall cates beſides their ordinary, be they neuer ſo rich, becauſe they make this accompt, that the more is ſpent in that ſort, the leſſe ſhall be their parts when it commeth to reckning and rifling. Notwithſtanding, if any be ſo poore that they are not able to liue of their owne in priſon, the King alloweth them a certaine for their daily diet, that is to ſay, halfe a riall of Plate, which is as much as a dutch batte, and is worth two ſouſe french, that is, 3. pence ſterling. Out of the which poore pittance is to be defrayed their <hi>Stewards</hi> and <hi>Laundres</hi> wages, and whatſoeuer other neceſſary char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges grow beſides, muſt bee thence alſo deducted.

This I haue deſcribed the more largely, becauſe all theſe Officers haue their certaine fees out of this ſmall allowance of the king: which paſſing thorow ſuch limed fingers is ſo fleeced, that it commeth not to the priſoners, but euery of theſe Officers will take not onely Tole, but Tythe, ere it paſſe his hands. For in this Houſe both maiſter and man, from head to foot, are all couetous and giuen to the ſpoile. Now if it happen at anie time by a ſpeciall grace of God, that any of theſe are touched with compaſſion to pitie the poore priſoners, and of verie almes doe relieue them by any meanes, that is counted ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>As it chanced within theſe few yeares, a certaine man to bee appointed keeper of the Inquiſitours priſon in the Caſtle <hi>Triana</hi> at <hi>Siuill,</hi> that was not verie euill diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, for as yet hee had not learned the trickes of that holy Houſe, nor well digeſted their couetous and cruell lawes, being otherwiſe verie courteous, and a man not far ſtricken in yeares: his name was <hi>Petro à Herrera.</hi> Who entreated the priſoners very well, and ſhewed them ſuch
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17938:56"/>
gentleneſſe and fauour as he could, yet cloſely and couert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he knew the Inquiſitours in that poynt well enough, how much they were enclined to tyranny. It happened in his time (as oftentimes it doth when a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber are apprehended at once) that among other priſoners, a certaine honeſt Matron was commited to his ward, with two of her owne daughters: which being put into ſeuerall priſons, had a great longing to ſee one another, and each to comfort the other in their diſtreſſes. Whereupon they beſought their keeper to ſuffer them to come together, if it were but onely for a quarter of an howre, or the ſpace that each might but imbrace other. The keeper being of a good nature, was content they ſhould ſo do, and ſuffered them to be together by the ſpace of halfe an houre: &amp; after they had a little ſhewed their affections, and done their duety each to other, the daughters to their mother, and ſhee to them again, hee brought euery one to her owne priſon where ſhee was before. Within a few dayes after, the keeper ſeeing the ſame perſons in moſt terrible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and fearing leſt the very extremity thereof would driue them to confeſſe that little curteſie &amp; fauour which hee ſhewed them, in ſuffering them to meete and talke together but onely for halfe an houres ſpace, went to the holy Houſe, confeſſed his fact, and prayed pardon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſuppoſing like a foole by his owne confeſſion to haue eſcaped the penaltie thereof. But the Inquiſitors (to whom it is incident to abhorre all kind of humanity) deemed it ſo haynous an offence, that they commanded him forthwith to be haled into priſon: wherein, partly by meanes of the great extremitie that was ſhewed vnto him, and partly of very thought and a certaine conceite that hee tooke thereupon, being therewithall ſomwhat melancholike, fell beſide himſelfe: and yet his infirmity and madnes notwithſtanding, they releaſed him no iote of his puniſhment. But after that hee had beene kept a whole yeare in a vile priſon, they brought him vpon their
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:17938:57"/>
triumphing ſtage, hauing a <hi>Sambenit</hi> on his back, and a rope about his neck like a fellon, and there gaue ſentence vpon him: firſt to be whipped about the city in the high ſtreetes, and to haue two hundred ſtripes beſtowed on him, and and afterwards to ſerue in a Gallie as a ſlaue, for ſix yeares. The next day following, as he was brought from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Triana</hi> with their acucſtomed ſolemnity, to bee ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, one of his madde fits that was wont to take him each other hower, came at the ſame time vpon him very pitiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo that in caſting himſelf off from the Aſſes back wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was ſet in deſpight, hee fell vpon the <hi>Alguazil,</hi> and doubtleſſe had ſlaine him with a ſword which he ſnatched out of his hand, if the people that gathered about him, had not ſuddainly laid hands on him, and ſet him vpon the Aſſe againe, binding him ſomewhat ſurer, to the intent that he might receiue the reſt of his payment. And after he had receiued his two hundred ſtripes, the Inquiſitours commanded, that for his euill vſage &amp; behauior ſhewed towards the <hi>Alguazil,</hi> he ſhould continue in the gally four yeares moe ouer and aboue the other ſix, to make vp a iuſt halfeſcore. So well doe theſe good and godly Fathers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward charitie and good deeds, and courteſie with crueltie and extremitie, ſo that a mad man with them may not play a mad touch.</p>

went for a great whil together, without any ſhift, &amp; thus deceiuetd both the Inquiſitors &amp; the Treaſurer, who allowed the keeper in his accounts for ſuch &amp; ſuch mony paid &amp; receiued to the priſoners behoof, for whoſe weekly expenſes it was appointed. And herein mark, I beſeech you, the notable negligence &amp; ſlippery dealing of both parties: Firſt, the winking of the Inquiſitours at the keepers beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: and ſecondly, the keepers vniuſt oppreſſion of the poor priſoners. But to ſay the truth, it is no very hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to deceiue them that wil neuer take paines to boult out a truth. For if any of the priſoners receiuing neuer ſo much iniury at the keepers hand, had complained at any time, or grudged any thing at all, the cruell tyrant would finde the means to be euen with them: for he would take &amp; remoue him from the place that he was in before, and thruſt him into ſome deep Dungeo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which they cal <hi>Mazorra,</hi> &amp; there would keepe him alone for two or three daies, giuing him not ſo much as a little ſtraw to lie vpon: &amp; as for his diet, neyther ſhould it be wholſome, nor yet ſufficient to hold life and ſoul together, but like to kill him, or at the leaſt to breed ſome extream ſickneſſe: all the which ſhould be done without commiſſion or warrant from the Inquiſitors, and yet would he very craftily and maliciouſly beare the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner in hand, that he did it wholly by the Inquiſitors ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall commandement. Now if any that had beene ſo iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly dealt withall, meaning to make complaint thereof to the Inquiſitours, ſhould deſire him to pray a day of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (as none may ſolicite that matter ſaue onely the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) the craftie knaue ſuſpecting that hereby hee ſhould make a rodde for his owne taile, would beare the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in hand hee had ſo done, and therewithall tell him, it would not bee granted at that time; and thus wlth ſuch forged anſwers would keepe the poore priſoner in that deep dungeon twelue or fifteene daies, till hee thought his anger were ſomewhat aſſwaged, and his courage tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly cooled, and then at the length would remoue him
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:17938:58"/>
thence to his old priſon againe, making the poor man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that he had cauſe to thank him for it, which of meer compaſſion and pittie that he took vpon him, trauayled to the Inquiſitours, and became an earneſt ſuter to them to get him releaſed. In ſumme, ſuch filching he vſed, and ſuch extremitie hee ſhewed towards the priſoners, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers men of very good credit and eſtimation with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitours, did make complaints thereof. Whereupon he was committed to priſon, and being found guiltie of diuers kindes of treacheries, yet notwithſtanding in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſentence vpon him, he found the Inquiſitours his very good Lords and maiſters, who knew full well that he had beene a full ſure ſtake to their holy Houſe, and a truſtie ſeruitour: ſo that his iudgement was eaſie enough; nothing like as was giuen vpon the other his ſucceſſour, that only ſuffered the mother &amp; her daughters to meet &amp; talk together for the ſpace but of one halfe hower. albeit for his owne miſdeedes well knowen and proued by him, he deſerued to be dealt withall in as euill ſort altogether, as the other was for his pittie and mercifulneſſe. But to proceed. His iudgement in the end was this: to ſtand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcaffold holding a wax taper in his hand, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to be baniſhed the citie for fiue yeares. And wheras they vſe wholy to confiſcate other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s goods, they did on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put this man to his fine of forfaiting the fee due to him by reaſon of his office, that ſhould haue bin paid vnto him by the holy Houſe: and this was done rather to ſatisfie his accuſers, then for any great zeal of puniſhing ſuch offences done by their holy Officers.</p>
               <p>The very ſame man had a maid-ſeruant in his houſe while he was in office there, who pittying the miſerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate that the poore priſoners were in, pined and hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarued by meanes of that wicked Iew her Maiſter (for ſhe herſelfe fauoured the Goſpel) did diuers times ſpeake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them at the grate, comforting &amp; exhorting them ſo wel as ſhe could, to arme themſelues with pacience, and did
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17938:58"/>
ſundry times put vnder the dore ſome good &amp; wholeſom meates for their weake and feeble bodies, declaring no leſſe charity in deedes, then ſhee had before vttered in words. Whoſe zeale (no doubt) was ſo much the more meruailous, that wanting of her own to part withal to Chriſts afflicted members, ſhee would priuily conuey from her Maiſter ſome of the meate which hee had lurched from the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their due allowance, and ſo reſtore vnto them their owne. And to giue vs the more cauſe to wonder at the miraculous prouidence of God, which of euill ſeede ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not alwaies the worſt corne, but ſomtimes the beſt, this maiden had a little damoſell her maiſters own daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to help her in theſe her conueiances. Moreouer, by this maydens meanes the priſoners came to vnderſtand one of anothers eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to know in what caſe euery of their afflicted brethren was: the which thing was both a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar comfort to themſelues, and a ſpeciall furtherance to their affaires. At the length, this alſo came to the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours eares: who, after that they had kept her in priſon a whole yeare, and there made her partaker of the like hardnes that the other priſoners were in, cauſed her to bee brought out vpon the day of their triumph, and ſet vpon the ſcaffold, where they gaue ſentence vpon her, to weare the <hi>Sambenite,</hi> and to bee whipped about the town with like infamy and extremity as had beene vſed to other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with two hundred ſtripes: the which was wholly performed the next day following. Beſides this, they did alſo baniſh her the cittie and the ſuburbes for tenne yeares, with this writting on her head. <hi>A fauourer and aider of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.</hi> Another thing alſo that ſo ſore incenſed the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours againſt her, was this: for that it was confeſſed vnto them vpon examination of others, that ſhee had diſcloſed vnto diuers citizens, after what ſort the priſoners were entreated at the Inquiſitours hands, aſwell in their diet as otherwiſe. The which example being compared with the former concerning the fact of her maſter, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:17938:59"/>
that each of them had therefore, is euidence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough to ſhew what indifferency they vſe in puniſhing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactours. But to my matter.</p>
               <p>It is a thing that hath neuer beene ſeen nor heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">The priſoners reſtrained the libertie of ſong.</note> their time, that either the moſt gallie ſlaue, or he that endured the worſt kind of bondage that euer was deuiſed by man, ſhould bee reſtrained and forbidden the ſolace of ſong, to recreate himſelfe withall in the middeſt of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful dumpes, to driue away fantaſies, and to relieue his penſiue and heauie heart with ſome kind of lightning. But this holy Houſe paſſing &amp; exceeding all the tyrannies that euer haue beene practiſed by or vpon any, depriueth the poore wretches of this ſmall ſolace in their greateſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and extremities. For if any of the priſoners begin to ſing any Pſalme, to the intent to eaſe his preſent griefe ſomwhat, or do recite any text of ſcripture, the more that the ſaying or ſinging thereof doth eaſe the ſilly ſoule, the greater matter do Inquiſitours and their officers make of it, taking it to be a great hinderance to their affaires if the priſoners be at any time light harted, becauſe their purpoſe is to keepe them in perpetuall ſlauery and thraldome, without hauing any one good day in all their liues. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo ſoone as they heare any of the priſoners to ſing or ſay ought aloud, by and by is there a limme or two of the Diuell, that is to ſay, one Notary or other, with the keeper of the priſon to command them ſilence, and to charge them in the Inquiſitours names to make no countenauce of mirth vpon paine of <hi>Excommunication.</hi> Which if hee ſeeme to contemne and make light of, or elſe to laugh at (as indeede it is no better worthy) hee ſhall haue a bit on on his tong, and be taught his obedience, will he nill he, and thenceforth be taken for a rebell and a contemner of the Inquiſitours authority, and ſhall not bee ſuffered to ſpeake but in a very low note, whereof they themſelues will apoint him the tune, and <hi>Sol-fa</hi> it before him. This is done for two ſpeciall conſiderations. The one to bereaue
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:17938:59"/>
the poor ſoules of all kind of ſolace (as I ſaid before): the other, for that the craftie old <hi>Syres</hi> learn by dayly experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that ſuch ſinging of Pſalmes or other ſongs made out of the Scripture, is a maruailous comfort vnto them, and a grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>couraging and hartening to others their weak bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that lie a great diſtance from them in other priſons. There is alſo another cauſe why they enioin them ſilence, for that by ſong or loud ſpeaking they might one know of another. Therefore it happeneth many times, that a man and his friend, the father and the ſonne, the husband and the wife, ſhall be all within one priſon-houſe, by the ſpace of two or three yeares together, and neither of them know of the others being there, till the time come that they ſee one another at the great Doom-day vpon the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. And vpon this conſideration eſpecially, this is wont to be one of their common queſtions in euery day of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: Whether the priſoners of ſeuerall priſons haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred or communed together, or the one know of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being there: and if they find it to be ſo, ſtraight vpon it, they ſhift priſons, and examine them vpon another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatory, to beat one thing out of another, if they haue had any maner of conference, or what counſell each of them gaue to the other.</p>
               <p>And this is the whole order of the priſoners diet: ſo that ſuch as goe not to the ſtake, for the moſt part periſh there, eyther of the great filth &amp; ſtench of the priſon; or if they bee deliuered thence, dye ſhortly after of the french diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, growing vpon them by reaſon of their corrupt and naughtie diet: either elſe of abundance of Melancholy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come altered in their wits, or at the leaſt haue ſuch queſie bodies diſpoſed to theſe or to ſome other greater maladies, that they conſume away by little and little, leading a farre more miſerable life, than were any death that they could dye. For proofe whereof, out of a number of examples, that might be brought only out of the Inquiſition at <hi>Siuil,</hi> I wil chuſe one worthy to be reported in al Chronicles for a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:17938:60"/>
ſpeciall example of their barbarous dealings.</p>
               <p>Not many yeares agoe, there arriued a certaine Engliſh ſhip into the port <hi>S. Lucars,</hi> which the Familiars going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord vpon, to make ſearch for Religion, as their manner is to doe before any man of them may be ſuffered to come on land, they tooke and carryed with them to priſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Engliſhmen that were in her, vpon ſuſpicion which they had on them to be profeſſors of the Goſpell, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine tokens and likelihoods which they eſpyed in them, and knew them by. In the ſame ſhip there was alſo a little boy not paſſing tenne or twelue yeares of age, ſonne to a very rich Marchant of England, that was owner (as they ſaid) both of the ſhip, and the moſt part of her lading. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other they tooke alſo this yong child (as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended) for hauing in his hands <hi>Dauids</hi> Pſalmes in Engliſh. But whoſo doth indifferently vnderſtand of their coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe and naughty practices, may well thinke without any offence to the holy Inquiſition, that the Fathers wealth was the occaſion, both of the childs impriſonment, and of the other miſery that did befall him afterward. Wherupon, they made <hi>Sequestration</hi> of the ſhip and goods, and carryed the child to priſon with the reſt of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, where he aboad by the ſpace of 6. or 8 moneths. This child was ſo well brought vp by his parents in vertue and good diſcipline, and the ſame tooke ſo deepe root in him, being dewed with the grace of God, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his tender age and hard impriſonment, he ceaſed not ſtill to giue moſt euident tokens of the ſame his good and godly education: inſomuch that many and ſundry times, but ſpecially euery morning and euening, hee did accuſtomably vſe to lift vp his eyes to heauen, and to call vpon God, from whence he was taught to looke and hope for all helpe and ſuccour. And as his keeper eſpyed him now and then making his prayers in that ſort, whereas he ought to haue beene aſhamed of himſelfe and of his paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, to ſee in ſo tender age ſuch a patterne of piety and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:17938:60"/>
godlines before his face, in ſtead thereof, ſo ſoone as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him lifting vp his eyes to heauen, ſaying ſome Pſalm or other prayers in Engliſh, Now ſurely (ſaith he) this boy is become a pretty heretick already. After the child had continued the foreſaid ſpace in that darke dungeon (being tenderly brought vp to fore in his fathers houſe) by reaſon the moiſture &amp; dampe of the priſon, &amp; of his corrup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Wherefore, to reſiſt

a number of wrongs (beſides other that come not to our eares) which the report was that the holy Houſe had done to their priſoners, where there was no good to be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way but one (I mean by the viſitation of priſon-houſes) marke I beſeech you the Inquiſitours, &amp; conſider ye what hypocrits they are: which in reſpect of their holy houſe &amp; Conſiſtorie, with their glorious titles, and the very name of <hi>Sanctity,</hi> wherin they ſeeme to excell all other prophane and temporall Courts, ſhould haue bin by all reaſon more bountifull and gentle, more full of comfort and charity, and in withſtanding iniuries, moſt iuſt and vpright, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prouiding for the neceſſities of the poore afflicted, and duely puniſhing ſuch as had wronged them any way, eyther by couetous or cruell dealing: yet were they ſo farre from doing their dueties herein, that it ſeemeth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their viſitation was deuiſed of purpoſe to a clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary end: in ſo much that the dayes when they keep their viſitations, may be more worthily termed dayes of Doom to the poore priſoners, than be thought meanes of eaſe or reliefe of their miſeries; as it appeareth moſt euidently by their common maner of dealing, on ſuch dayes appointed for the viſitation. Whereof wee purpoſe here to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſall.</p>
               <p>The viſitation of priſons is commonly once or twice euery moneth kept by the Inquiſitors, a Notary, and the Keeper, &amp; for the moſt part vpon the Sunday or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feſtiuall day. The maner of it is on this wiſe. At the very firſt entrance into the priſon, the Inquiſitor demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the priſoners theſe queſtions: How it is with them: <note place="margin">The maner of their viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> what they want: whether their Keeper giue them any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill language, or threaten them, or vſe any words of deſpight or reproach towards them: if he giue them their ful allowance in their diet duly and truly, or prouide them ſhift of ſhirtes, with ſuch words. For in very deede there is no hope of one drop of comfort at their hands for all this buſineſſe: but are onely words and queſtions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17938:62"/>
courſe, &amp; ſpeciall articles preſcribed vnto them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire vpon, whereunto they neither adde any more in words, nor performe ſo much in deeds. As; if the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be halfe naked, or want a couch to reſt him on, and ſhould pray that his neceſſity may be conſidered &amp; proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, they ſhape him ſuch an anſwer as ſerueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both for winter &amp; ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer. And their anſwer in ſummer is thus, in very mild &amp; fatherly terms: Well (ſay they) now the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is warm, you may liue full well without either clothes or couch. And for winter in this ſort: True it is, it hath bin a great froſt of late, but now that it thaweth, and the cold is come downe and reſolued into ſnow and raine, ſo that the ayre is open and cleared, you ſhall haue a more ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable time. Care you for the garments wherewithall you ſhould cloth your ſoule, which ſtandeth in vttering the truth, and diſcharging your conſcience before this holy Houſe: for this ſhould be your ſpeciall care. And here is all the prouiſion which they make for them, for all their que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning at the firſt; and ſo departing as they came, their viſitation in the end turneth but to a ieſt: ſo that, if their viſitations were dayly, ye ſee all the comfort that the priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſhould haue at theſe holy Fathers hands. Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handing true it is, that ſome ſuch whom they owe ſpeciall fauour vnto, receiue ſome curteſie at their hands, and eaſie it is to iudge who they be that find it, where coueteouſnes and cruelty keep their Court.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe if any of the priſoners, either learned or vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, deſire to haue ſome good book, or the holy bible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to read, to the intent to paſs that troubleſome and carefull time away to ſome profit, they ſhift him off with the like anſwer for a book, as they vſe before to him that was naked and without garments.

Now, all the hardneſſe of this matter reſteth on this point, to get the Inquiſitour to take it. But for any other vnder-officers, it is an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bribe them, ſo it be done priuily or by night: for ſuch fellows will ſoon be corrupted. Marrie their maiſters make it ſomwhat more daintie and ſtrange: yea it were a thing impoſſible, if a man would take their firſt nay. Which commonly is after this ſort; that this holy Court is a Court incorrupt, that can away with bribes in no caſe, &amp;c. But ſith their anſwers are but from the teeth outward, all this adoo in excuſing themſelues, and refuſing the proffer, is a plaine token that they would bee content to haue it with all their hearts. Therefore is the Inquiſitour for the moſt part neuer without ſome of his brethren or ſiſters children about him, or ſome one ſeruant to whom hee ſheweth ſpeciall fauour and good will: the which ſeruant muſt be tendered and regarded as much as himſelfe. Then is there alſo another wayter that ſtanding by and ſeeing this great adoo betwixt the Inquiſitour and the other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:17938:63"/>
the one proffering, and the other refuſing as faſt, when the party beginneth to relent, ſhall come vnto him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, and teach him a trick how to obtain his purpoſe, &amp; entring talk with him without any manner of occaſion, wil point him to one with his finger, and ſay, Sir, ſee ye yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the young gentleman that ſtandeth at my Lords el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow? He is my Lords Nephue. Now is there none ſo very an Aſſe, that hauing made ſo much adoo in tempting the Inquiſitour, but hee may eaſily perceiue that there is one ready to hold the poke, and to receiue his proffer, though the other refuſed it. And ſo by this meanes at the length the poore priſoners get ſomewhat releaſed. Whereby it is apparant, what ſpirit this holy Houſe is gouerned by, when couetouſneſſe is able more to preuail with them to further a deed of charity, than charity for her owne ſake could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue gotten or obtained at their hands.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THere remaineth now the laſt Act of the Tragedy, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is the very winding vp of all that is to be done in this holy Court. Wherein both parties are pleaſed, &amp; haue their deſire. The Inquiſitours in obtayning their prey: the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners ſeeing the terrible and continuall torments, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſleights and practices of the Inquiſitours, with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream and cruell dealings, grow to an end. For then doe they heare their finall iudgements after their matters haue been toſſed to and fro many yeares in open Court, and in ſo great an audience and aſſembly, as there hath not been ſeen a greater, no not at <hi>Olimpus</hi> it ſelf. This Act of Faith they commonly called <hi>Auto.</hi> And ſurely good cauſe why. For then is the priſoners faith tried to the vttermoſt, and ſheweth it ſelfe what it is, either by denying and abiuring Gods truth in open and ſolemne audience, or elſe by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtoutly and manfully therein, in like ſolemnity of ſhew and view of all the people, thronging together purpoſely. Let the inquiſitours therfore deriue the word, and deſcant
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17938:63"/>
of it as they pleaſe: we doo conſtrue it thus, as in a ſence moſt agreeable to Gods iudgement.</p>
               <p>This act hath many idle deuices, or to ſpeake more aptly, this Paſcall of Gods people <hi>Pelah:</hi> that is to ſay, this paſſage out of Egypt to the land of promiſe, I meane from the world to God, hath his <hi>Euen,</hi> his preparation. <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 13. For a few dayes before this feaſt, the Inquiſitours vſe to call into the Court ſeuerally one after other, all ſuch perſons whoſe goods are confiſcate: examining them what lands or goods they haue, and where they lie, charging them earneſtly that they conceale not one iot; declaring vnto them further, that if afterward it can be proued that they haue kept any thing back, both fellonie ſhall be laid to their charge, and they alſo in whoſe hands it is found ſhall pay for it moſt aſſuredly. After they haue confeſſed the whole truth of all their other goods and ſubſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſuch as were taken and found in their owne houſe at the firſt time of their apprehenſion, and ſo ſequeſtred, and that all be eſtreited into the accomptes of the Eſchec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, they returne euery one to his own priſon againe, being aſſured to loſe all their goods, howſoeuer they eſcape with their liues.</p>
               <p>But the right <hi>Euen</hi> is the daie next and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately going before the feſtiuall day.

again, about 9. or 10. of the clock at night, there is ſent to each of them ſome pelting Prieſt to cary them this heauie tidings, and to be their ghoſtly father. And now at this laſt inſtant, the man to whom God hath giuen the ſpirit of conſtancy and boldnes, maketh his laſt proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his faith, to the ſhame of his Confeſſour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of all that helliſh army. But on the other part, hee that hath not beene conſtant to fore, nor is at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, hath now a time to call for grace at Gods handes (the onely giuer of all gifts and graces) thoſe eſpeciall gifts of conſtancy and patience. Howbeit both ſortes haue much to do with their ghoſtly fathers: the one in mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their faith now in their laſt howre and moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous time of all: the other in hopeleſſe entreating and praying their pardon of life. Yet is there neither of them both but in that night they are occupied on euery ſide, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining (no doubt) a great temptation, both in that their fleſh is fraile, and the diuell ſtirring; and yet ſure it is, that the heauenly Father forgetteth not his children in that howre. Yea, this night wherein his members ſuffer ſuch agony, may be well reſembled vnto that, which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the head of all, ſuffred, both for the anguiſh of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, and the comfort that came from heauen.</p>
               <p>The next morrow by day breake, the Familiars and all the reſt of the officers pertaining to the Inquiſition, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together euery man to doe his office about this holy Sacrifice, and to attire ſuch priſoners as are to be brought out before the people euery one in his aray, very curiouſly, in ſuch ſort as was by the ſentence pronounced &amp; preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. Whereof ſuch as ſtood ſtoutly to their tackling, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended their profeſſion againſt their deteſtable falſhoods, weare the <hi>Sambenit</hi> vnto the very ſtake, which is a linnen garment of the colour of the earth, made like to a coate-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, <note place="margin">The deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sambenit</note> and all to be painted with black diuels, ouer whom the manful ſouldiour of Chriſt triumpheth in token of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie.

On his head he hath a hat long like a turret, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is pictured the image of a man burning in the fire with many diuels about him, plying him with ſire and fagots. It is much after the maner of a foughten field, as I may li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it. For there is the whole skirmiſh, with the ouerthrow of his enemies, ſet for a greater glory &amp; ſhew of conqueſt and victory. Moreouer, their tongues are nipped and pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with a cleft peece of wood which they call <hi>Mordazas,</hi> of the Latin word <hi>Mordeo</hi> to bite, becauſe the priſoners ſhould not make any proteſtation before the people, either of their innocency, or of their beliefe; hauing beſides this about their necks new cords made of bentes, and their hands faſt bound behind them. Whereby he declareth (in mine opinion) like a good champion (though his deſerts in other reſpects be ſomewhat) yet that hee repoſeth no truſt or confidence in them, but in the onely and vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keable mercies of God, for the confeſſing of whoſe holy name he is readie to dye the moſt terrible death, &amp; ſo will appeare before the iudgement ſeate of God: whereas if God ſhould deale with him ſtraitly according to the letter and the law, notwithſtanding all thoſe glorious workes that make him ſo famous among men, hee ſhould well find, there were nothing remaining for him in the end, but the deſtinie and reward of a villanous theefe. And on this ſort come theſe conſtant martyrs diſguiſed, and bearing theſe badges: firſt vpon the ſtage, &amp; ſo conſequently to the ſtake. Likewiſe, they that by reuolting and denying the truth, haue brought the Fathers in ſome hope of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, haue iudgement of death neuertheleſſe, and are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed in like ſort, ſaue only that in ſteede of the diuels pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, there is the image of the croſſe, hauing their hands bound in like ſort; that as the other haue borne the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes &amp; cognizance of true faith and manly courage, ſo theſe may carrie alſo the badges of daſtardie &amp; falſe faith. And in like ſort doe all the reſt come forth, arayed as the other, and beſette with like badges more or leſſe, as

it pleaſeth the Inquiſitours to diſgrace them in the ſight of the people.</p>
               <p>But at what time the priſoners are ready to paſſe out of the Caſtle <hi>Triana</hi> where they were impriſoned, then the holy Houſe affecteth of purpoſe to ſeeme full of pitty and charitie towards them, in the ſight of the common people. For after that they bee diſguiſed on this ſort, and euery man ſet in his order as he ſhall iſſue forth, they are commanded to pauſe a while, and forth with are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine tables ſpread for them as they ſtand, and a very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull breakfaſt in ſhew, of roſted hennes, kidde, and ſuch like prepared, wherewith they would blind the common ſort, and perſwade them, that they had bin none otherwiſe vſed in priſon, beginning now at the laſt to make them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the euill entertainment which they had before. Howbeit the poor ſouls are in that taking at that time, that they will doe the meat no great harme, and therfore thoſe cut-throats the Familiars, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> vſe to gard the priſoners on each ſide, do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſnatch the meat from before them, &amp; deuour it without either check or controlement.

And his ſhame was for his offence, but the eaſe of his griefe; and the plaiſter which the Paſtours and Preachers applied to his ruptures, was the perfect Plaiſter and true Sanatiue, that healed his wounded and corrupt conſcience. Neyther was it their maner that preſcribed the penance, to triumph on that day, or to ſend for their braueſt ſutes out of their wardrobes, to goe and ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues abroad-in in token of ioy and victorie: but came themſelues in mourning weede, and ſo likewiſe did the whole congregation, declaring by that outward ſhew of ſorrow, that their hearts were touched inwardly with the fall and infirmities of their brethren. Inſomuch that manie times the <hi>Cenſors</hi> themſelues haue been ſeen to ſhed moe teares than haue the Penitentiaries, vnfainedly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing the ſhame which the other ſuſtained (as right and reaſon was) for their miſdeeds.

As for any of the Preachers or Miniſters, none of them had any allowance or fees from the Eſchec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, or any one fleece or locke of wool from the backes of any of his flocke, neyther was any thing found in their houſes that came by ſpoile of the poore. <hi>Ezechiel</hi> 34. <hi>Eſay</hi> 3. <hi>Woe be to you ſhepheards, &amp;c.</hi> Againſt the which albeit there be good cauſe to complain and cry out preſently, yet may
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:17938:67"/>
there perhaps be ſome other oportunitie elſwhere to do it. My meaning in this place is, onely to make a plat without any order or faſhion, that ſuch as haue any ſenſe at all left within them in this vniuerſall time of ignorance and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, may beginne to weigh and conſider what difference there is betwixt theſe triumphes ſet out with ſuch prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and iollitie, and the publick penance vſed in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, which the holie Houſe braggeth ſo much that they retaine till this day.</p>
               <p>Thus, when euery man hath taken his place in order, one beginneth a Sermon, which is purpoſely deuiſed much in commendation of the holy Houſe, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſuch hereſies as they are preſently about to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute. But the greateſt part of it is ſpent in ſhamefull and ſlanderous reproaches, wherewith they charge the good chriſtians, adding one trouble and griefe in the neck of another. Which if they ſeeme to take in good part, ſeeing themſelues ſet there as wondering ſtocks to all the world, and marks for them to ſhoot all their diueliſh darts of ſhamefull and reproachfull ſlanders at, either it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they beare them off with the ſure buckler of faith: or elſe by reaſon that they haue been acquainted therewith, and their hearts hardned with ſuch continuall exerciſe, like ſenceleſſe men they feel now no touch of them. When the ſermon is finiſhed, they begin to reade the ſentences giuen vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the penitentiaries in order as euery man came, or in place as they ſit, beginning with ſuch as are to haue the eaſieſt iudgements and puniſhments firſt. This part of the Act is ſomwhat long, &amp; becauſe it is the chiefeſt part, therefore it requireth ſome ſpeciall treatiſe, but hereafter in more conuenient place. The Sentences being thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly al pronounced, the chiefe Commiſſioner for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition ſingeth certain ſhort praiers for the Conuerts (as they call them) which neuertheleſſe muſt die alſo: the effect wherof is, that God would vouchafe to extend his mercy and fauour towards them, that they may perſeuer in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:17938:67"/>
the doctrine of the Church of Rome, &amp; die therin. Which don, they begin to ſing <hi>Miſerere</hi> the 51. Pſalme for the obtaining of Gods fauour and mercy towards the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiaries; and that the diſcipline and abſolutions done and executed vpon them by the Fathers, may be effectuall &amp; auailable vnto them to true repentance. The ſentences are moſt commonly theſe. <hi>Death</hi> without mercie: <hi>Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> with extremitie, that the parties either not at all, or elſe verie hardly eſcape with their liues: <hi>Condemnation</hi> to the <hi>gally,</hi> &amp; <hi>Forfaiture</hi> of all their goods, with ſuch like penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, wherein the good mother-church of Rome exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth her pittie and compaſſion towards her children by the Inquiſitours as by her meanes, thinking the proofe and the effect of true repentance neceſſarily to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt therein. Now ſurely the whole world may ſee and perceiue (and that not onely ſuch as haue drunke of her cup) the ourageous tyrannie of ſuch Termagants as haue bragged and boaſted of themſelues, that they are the true Church of Chriſt, and be occaſioned thereby to remember themſelues, and to eſteeme of them as they are.</p>
               <p>The Pſalme being ended, which they abuſe to their purpoſe moſt impudently and abominably, in a plaine mockerie (as they doe commonly all other places of Scripture) the chiefe Inquiſitour ſingeth a ſort of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicles: and the whole Quier anſwereth them with their Reſponſes, in a high and a loud note, ſtrayning their cunning and pipes to the vttermoſt. Which done, the Inquiſitour of his abſolute authoritie pronounceth abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in a kind of note, wherein hee abſolueth all ſuch as are come home to the church of Rome (but forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Chriſt) from all their errors whereof they ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues penitent, foraſmuch as they haue ſwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:17938:68"/>
not from the penalty. For they muſt forth with, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this their recantation, abide the penalties with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either mercy, iuſtice, or conſcience.</p>
               <p>After the abſolution, the Inquiſitours haue yet one o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notable deuice to vphold their kingdom withall as it were with anker and chaine cable, which is a manifeſt proofe, that they are halfe in doubt, leſt nor they nor their kingdome ſhould long continue. And the deuice is this: That all the people gathered together at that time, whereof ſome come to ſee the ſolemnity aboue 20. leagues off, take a ſolemne oath before them, and bind themſelues thereby, vowing the performance thereof, that they will liue and dye in the ſeruice and obedience of the church of Rome, and by all meanes poſſible, to their power defend and maintaine it, hazarding both life and goods againſt any whoſoeuer ſhall goe about to ouerthrow it. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, they make them to forſweare and curſe, whatſoeuer is contrary to that which the church of Rome holdeth and affirmeth for true. Alſo that to their power they ſhall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and vphold the holie Houſe, and defend all the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers thereof, &amp;c. In witnes wherof, and for a further ſurety of the matter, they take recor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>one of another. And then may a man ſee the ſilly common people, &amp; thoſe of higher eſtate and degree crouch to the earth with great deuotion, and through ignorance take their oaths againſt God and his anointed, raſhly &amp; wickedly conſpiring together, euery man to his power, to be a promoter and ſetter forward of the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi> Now if you talk with any man about the aboliſhing of this monſter of all wickednes and iniquity out of the world, though he confeſſe of himſelfe, and grant indeede, that there is much cruelty &amp; tyranny vſed therin: he will tell you a tale again, of his ſolemne oath taken and vow vowed, in open and ſolemne audience, and what can ye reply to him then? Marry (ſir) thus. How that certain of the Iewes of very blind ignorance &amp; ſuperſtition did bind themſelues with an oath, and made a ſolemne vow, that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:17938:68"/>
they would neither eate nor drinke till they had ſlain <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 23. And theſe men (ſay we) ſinne thrice ſo deepely as they, and therefore are leſſe bound to ſeeke to ſaue their oath, ſo wickedly taken and ſo vngodly. Firſt, for that they of a blind and therefore a wicked zeale, in defence of their law, do fight againſt the Goſpell of Chriſt. Secondly, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing and abhominably prophaning the name of God, ſwearing by his holy name, with al their might &amp; main, to maintaine an euill quarrell, and depreſſe a better, which lieth not in them to do. Thirdly, whereas they ſhould in time reuoke and retract all things begun againſt God and his holy word, they do ſtill proceed &amp; go forward in their purpoſe like the ſtubburne and ſtifnecked Iewes. Can any man come in now and auer the contrary? But when it ſhall bee moſt manifeſtly proued, that the Inquiſitors haue gon about buſily &amp; of purpoſe to deſtroy the kingdom of Chriſt, as did the wicked Iewes, then ſhal it alſo be euident and apparant, that ſuch as haue vowed this ſolemne oath, though it were of ignorance, haue incurred all thoſe three ſeuerall offences. Wherefore, if they will take vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and learne to be wiſe in time, this will bee one way and meanes for them to recouer their ſaluation. Firſt, to conſider diligently what kind of quarrel the Inquiſitours do take in hand to maintaine. Secondly, to weigh with themſelues, whether they fight vnder the Inquiſitours banner for Chriſt, or againſt Chriſt, and ſo let them keepe or breake their oath, as they ſhall thinke good, after they haue debated the matter thorowly. Now to our purpoſe againe.</p>
               <p>After all things thus done and finiſhed, if any there bee among the Penitentiaries that deſerue to be ſo ſerued, they are ſtraight-way degraded: and the Biſhop that miniſtred the orders to the party, plaieth that part, arraied all in his <hi>Pontificalibus.</hi> The ceremonies vſed about the <hi>actuall degradation</hi> (as they terme it) of him that is to bee executed that day, are both ſtrange and tragicall.

Then are his hands, lips, and crowne, ſcraped with a broken glaſſe or ſome ſharp knife, in token that they ſcrape off the oyle that hee was greaſed withall at his firſt initiation. All the which is done in the full view and wonder of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſome pitying the poore man, and ſome curſing him worſe than lew or Pagane, being indeede moſt happie, if it bee but for this one thing, that in the latter end of his life hee cryeth <hi>abrenuntio</hi> to that greaſie and ſtinking oyle, ſcraping away that <hi>Baals marke</hi> and that Apiſh patch ſo well as it will be, and ſo departing. But ſuch as haue not iudgement of death, are degraded onely <hi>verbaliter</hi> (as they term it) that is to ſay, by word. Which is in effect a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from all function &amp; preferment, during the Popes pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Another ceremony they haue, that in no caſe is to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, wherin the holy Houſe moſt ſhamefully and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any kind of colour in the world, mocketh both God &amp; man, and all the whole company preſent, giuing all men good cauſe iuſtly to laugh at their folly: &amp; that is this. In the end of their ſentence pronounced vpon ſuch as haue iudgement to be burned (their conuerſion to the church of Rome notwithſtanding) they adde moreouer &amp; cauſe there openly to be proclaimed, that foraſmuch as the holy Houſe miſtruſteth that the party is not truly conuerted nor from his heart, but counterfaiteth, and doe feare therefore, leſt a wolfe lurke ſtill vnder a ſheepes clothing, for all his ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of conuerſion, they do giue &amp; bequeath him to the ſecular power, with this humble requeſt vnto them, to ſhew the partie ſo much fauour as may be, and to breake neither bone, nor pearce any skin of his body. But ſuch as
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:17938:69"/>
nothing was able to remoue from their godly profeſſion, whom they tearme Wilfull and Obſtinate perſons, they commend to the ſame power, with theſe words. Foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we haue laboured earneſtly, and taken great paines with this man, to bring him home to our mother-church of Rome, and can doe no good on him, but that ſtill hee continueth obſtinatly in his opinions, &amp;c. we therfore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer this fellow to the ſecular power, to doe execution on him according to order of law: yet praying them by the way, that if he ſhew any tokens of true repentance, to deal as fauourably with him as they may, with other ſuch like ſpeech. And what impudencie (I pray you) is this? They haue already giuen ſentence vpon him that hee muſt dye, and therupon deliuer him to the ſecular power to be burnt, in ſo much, that if they that ſhould ſee execution done, do eyther ſuffer the partie to make an eſcape, or elſe keepe him and not burne him, they themſelues ſhould bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to ſupply his place: and yet they require thus much at their hands, to vſe as much mercie towards him as they may.

to the intent to diſgrace his perſon, &amp; to make both him and his doctrin the more abhorred of men, and encreaſe their owne eſtimation and credit, as moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie members to ſcoure and ridde the world of ſuch peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous perſons, Whiles all this geare is in rehearſing to the people. they clappe vpon the parties tongue a cleft peece of wood, in maner as it were a <hi>barnacle,</hi> to his great and intolerable paine, ſo that hee can anſwer ne gain-ſay, nothing in defence of himſelfe and his owne inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie. For if hee might be ſuffered and let alone, he would openly giue them the lye to their faces: as it hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diuers times. Howbeit the controuerſie were not like long to continue. For ſtraightway the fellow ſhould bee ſure to haue his mouth gagged, or his tongue ſtocked, to teach him to be quiet, &amp; to ſay nothing openly. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that which is the parties confeſſion in very deede, is ſo peruerted and corrupted, with the words ſo changed, &amp; rechanged in reading, that in a maner it may be very well ſaid for him, that hee neuer ſpake nor thought any ſuch thing. Wherof I will here ſhew ſome ſpeciall examples, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be matters of weight, and ſuch as cannot eaſily bee contraried, foraſmuch as the whole world ſeeth and knoweth them well enough.</p>
               <p>After that all the <hi>ſentences</hi> bee read, and the <hi>act uall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation</hi> wholly finiſhed, the temporall magiſtrate taketh them into his hands very ſolemnely, according as it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned him by the <hi>holy Houſe,</hi> and ſo conueyeth them to the place of execution, with a ſort of the diuels owne Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors about them, calling &amp; crying vpon them with great importunity to forſake the truth which they haue receiued and profeſſed. And many times it chanceth, that ſuch as conſtantly perſeuer in confeſſing the truth to the end, doe breake their neckes againſt the ſtake with a trice, and then they noiſe abroad among the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people, that ſuch, &amp; ſuch repentantly recanted their hereſies at their verie laſt howre, and came home again to the Church of Rome, and

therefore felt no force of fire at all, by reaſon of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours mercie and pittie extended vpon ſuch as became conuerted. By theſe, and ſuch like ſubtill practices, they goe about to bury the truth, as though God the auenger thereof were not able to raiſe it vp againe out of darkneſſe and dungeons. The reſidue, which be not condemned to dye, are caried backe to priſon againe: and the next day after, are brought out &amp; whipt, ſuch as had like ſentence pronounced vpon them: whereof diuers are afterward ſent to the <hi>gally,</hi> others remanded to <hi>perpetuall priſon,</hi> either to <hi>Triana</hi> the ſpeciall priſon for the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> or to ſome place elſwhere altogether as euill as a priſon, with this <hi>Item</hi> to them ere they goe: that if they happen hereafter to call anything to minde, that erſt they haue not diſcloſed, they immediately reſort to the <hi>holy Houſe,</hi> and declare it whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be: for if it be found otherwiſe, that they haue craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and cloſely concealed any thing, they ſhall be reputed (ſay they) as perſons without remorce of conſcience, and like-to be ſharply and ſeuerely puniſhed therefore. But the chiefeſt matter that they giue them in charge is, in no caſe to reueale any thing that they haue either heard or ſeene during the time of their impriſonment, concerning the maner of their entreating in any reſpect, either of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or impriſonment, or otherwiſe, how and after what ſort they haue generally proceeded in Court againſt them, and their fellow priſoners; but for the time of their being there, ſhould take and repute themſelues altogether as dead perſons. For if the contrary can be proued by them, or that it come to the Inquiſitours eares that they haue vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered any of their ſecrets, they ſhall be taken for perſons Relapſed (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And the iudgement appointed for ſuch, <hi>is death without redemption,</hi> which ſurely is a deuiſe aboue al the reſt, and might worſe be ſpared. For by this their ſo ſtrait en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning them ſilence vpon paine of their liues, they cope them (as it were) with needle &amp; threed, and ſo keepe in all

their knauery and tyranny as ſure as vnder locke and key, both cloſe and ſecret to themſelues. They know full well, I wis, that if the king who authoriſed them, ſhould by any meanes vnderſtand their falſe play which they vſe, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and iniurie that they offer, the ſlanderous reports which they make the wonderfull fetches, and diuelliſh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices which they practiſe to entrappe diuers and ſundrie poore innocents, charging them with manie matters, which neyther they ſaid, nor ſaw, nor heard at anie time, but ſpecially if hee vnderſtood of their couetous and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell dealings, &amp; (as I may ſay) more than barbarous, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that greedie deſire of theirs: he would (no doubt of it) turne the Inquiſition on their owne neckes, and foreſee the ſafetie aſwell of his owne ſubiects, as the common-weale of the countrey, and prouide for it accordingly: but chiefly hee would ſee to the execution of Iuſtice, whereof he is appointed by God a lawfull Protectour, rather than the enriching of his bagges and coffers, won by ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull meanes.

Furthermore, they labour ſo earneſtly to burie the truth, and are ſo carefull leſt their crueltie ſhould come to light, that among other great penalies which they enioine to diuers men of worſhip and good reputation, and ſome of honour and in authoritie, after they haue kept them in priſon a ſeaſon, and cauſed them to ſuſtaine open infamie, they inhibite them the company and conference of any, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſuch as they ſhal appoint &amp; allow them: neither will ſuffer them to write to any friend of theirs without making them priuie vnto it, that they might haue the peruſing thereof. Their colour for this matter (forſooth) is very prettie, leſt that by conference or writing of letters, they ſhould publiſh their hereticall opinions. But in verie deede their drift is, leſt ſuch men as haue good friends and bee well allied, ſhould complaine and make their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:17938:72"/>
mone to their friends &amp; allies, of the iniuries that haue bin done vnto them, and they make means to the King to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire further of their doings, &amp; ſo bring the practices of the holy Houſe to light. Wherof this is proof ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that they vſe not this kind of puniſhment to any of the meaner ſort, but only to them that be of good bloud &amp; parentage.</p>
               <p>For at the very firſt beginning, when the maner of their Triumph firſt came vp, and was executed vpon the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranes (as they call them) they that were preſent at the ſight, and beheld the order and faſhion well, were wont to write vnto their friends both within the Realme and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, of all ſuch things as there were done and ſeene, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of ſuch as did penance: alſo what ſentences were pronounced vpon them, with the cauſes and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all their other puniſhmentes and penalties. But the <hi>holy Houſe</hi> (as dayly practice maketh euerie one his crafts-maiſter) grew ſo cunning in their affaires, that ſtraight-way they beganne to ſmell out the matter, that it might in time worke them ſome diſpleaſure, and therewithall that the doctrin which they ſo greatly deteſt and abhorre, might bee publiſhed and ſpreade further than they would wiſh it, ſo that manie which otherwiſe would haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their blindneſſe ſtill, if they had neuer heard nor ſeene anie ſuch reportes, ſhould bee occaſioned thereby, to open their eyes and vnderſtandings, and to confeſſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well the doctrine it ſelfe, and receiue it, as alſo eſpie the wickedneſſe of them that perſecute it. Therefore for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie of this miſchiefe and inconuenience, the <hi>holy Houſe</hi> prouided, by making and publiſhing certaine <hi>preſidentes</hi> of ſuch like reportes, briefe, and in ſuch wiſe as were not likely to doe anie great harme: that who ſo were diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to certifie their friends of ſuch matters, ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thoſe <hi>preſidentes</hi> in any caſe: &amp; therfore appointed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine great penalties for the tranſgreſſours hereof, that ſhould make their reportes in any other more large or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple maner, than was by their order preſcribed. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:17938:72"/>
wherof was this: That after they had told who &amp; what <note place="margin">The Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents for letters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the holy Houſe.</note> maner of man he was that was puniſhed or executed, they ſhould adde moreouer, becauſe he held with <hi>Luther,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out naming any of his opinions, (which notwithſtanding were ſpecially recited before) was burned, or thus, or thus puniſhed or executed, according to the truth of the matter.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as the <hi>holy Houſe</hi> well may erre (albeit men now adayes are ſo bewitched with ſuperſtition and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, that they dare affirme the contrarie, being ordered, and guided (ſay they) by the holy Ghoſt) ſo it commeth diuers times to paſſe, that ſome be cauſeleſſe apprehended, ſome vpon verie ſmall and light complaints, verie few vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on anie lawfull and ſufficient information. And the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt part, after they haue beene impriſoned in ſuch miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſort as I haue before declared, for a yeare, or two, or more, till their cauſes were thorowly examined, at the laſt being tryed and found guiltleſſe, ſo that neceſſarily they are to be diſcharged, within a day or two after their great day of Triumph, they bring them into the Court, &amp; there beginne to ſet on them againe as freſhly as euer they did, willing them to vtter the truth, as they will auoid their diſpleaſures and the extremitie of law, threatning them the Rack, and ſaying that there is now come in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient matter by information againſt them. Then if any will be feared with this facing, and be brought but to vtter one word of any ſuch matters as they are deſirous to heare of, they ſend him ſtraight to ward againe, and renue their ſute againſt him from the beginning. But if nothing can bee gotte out of him by this meanes, nor that they haue anie thing elſe to charge him withall, they leaue off threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and fall to flattering: ſaying, that they haue a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion of him than ſo, and therefore are reſolued to ſend him home again to his owne houſe: for the which fatherly fauour extended towards him in ſauing both his life and his goods, hee is to account himſelfe much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding and bound to their Lordſhips, willing him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17938:73"/>
himſelf, that what fauour they haue ſhewed him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie, they mean to continue towards him, for the good liking that they had of him at the very firſt view, but ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the good example of patience which he ſhewed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time of his impriſonment. With theſe and ſuch like <hi>Lenitiues</hi> the <hi>good and vpright Iudges</hi> think to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the reſt of his ſores that were of their owne making, &amp; to ſend him home to his houſe at the laſt, with ſpeciall charge that he be ſilent. Yet ſometime they detaine him in priſon a good while after, notwithſtanding that hee bee found not guiltie, nothing regarding what any, be he neuer ſo guiltleſſe, ſuffer at their hands, and there doe keepe him cloſely &amp; craſtily till a day or two after their great ſtate and iollity, that being diſmiſſed neer about the time that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are, the common people may think he receiued his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment amongſt the reſt, tho in ſome leſſer degree, and thereby be perſwaded that the <hi>holy Houſe</hi> neuer vexeth any man without ſufficient information. And marke I pray you one other new found guiſe that theſe rauening wolues haue got to obtain their prey &amp; ſpoile withall: that ſuch perſons as among other parcels of their puniſhments are condemned either to perpetuall impriſonment, either du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Inquiſitors pleaſure, or for a certaine ſeaſon, albeit they remaine no longer in <hi>Triana,</hi> that is, the Inquiſitours proper and peculiar priſon, becauſe they ſhall think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues quite and clear diſpatched, and to haue no more to doe with the holy Houſe: yet wherſoeuer they be appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their place of aboad as an impriſonment, there be ſpies alſo to mark diligently how they take the matter, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they put it vp quietly, yea or no, or what they ſay vnto it. For if they bee chearefull, or doe any wayes make but a countenance of mirth in this time of their trouble, they ſhall both incurre the Inquiſitours diſpleaſure therfore, and feel a greater ſmart beſides. They alſo that doe remaine in ſuch appointed places, are likewiſe viſited ſometime by the Inquiſitours; but in ſuch ſort as hath bin deſcribed of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:17938:73"/>
other, and to the very ſame end and purpoſe, that is to ſay, that the common people might ſee how full of mercie and pittie they are: howbeit it is to this end, to bring them more in feare and awe of them, &amp; of their diſpleaſure. For then beginne they (as it were) to keep Court, and to make inquirie both of the priſoners themſelues &amp; of the keepers; whether ſince their departure out of <hi>Triana</hi> they haue heard any of their fellowes ſay any thing touching matters of religion, who it was that did ſo, and what countenance o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that heard it, made thereunto. Alſo, whether any man doe grudge or find himſelfe grieued for any puniſhment that he hath endured, but eſpecially, whether they haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed any myſterie or ſecret of theirs, or whether any man haue compaſſed or imagined to make an eſcape, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſuch like queſtions. And if they finde no ſuch matters, they return as wiſe as they came, If otherwiſe there appeare any euident matter againſt them, then commence they their ſute againſt him or them. Not many yeares agoe, it chanced at <hi>Siuill</hi> in ſuch a like viſitation, that a certaine priſoner, after hee had remained in priſon for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine yeares at the chiefe Inquiſitours pleaſure, whoſe name was <hi>Licentiato Gaſco,</hi> made verie earneſt ſuite vnto him for his diſcharge and deliuerance thence. This <hi>Gaſco</hi> was a man well learned in both the lawes, as it ſeemed: who ſtrayning himſelfe to ſpeake ſomewhat wiſely, made this graue and goodly anſwer vnto him, paſſing all wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or good religion. Now Sirs (ſaith hee) you muſt <note place="margin">My Lord the chiefe Inquiſitors occaſion.</note> take your affliction patiently, for here you ſuffer for the ſinnes of the people, and for ours aſwell as for your owne. Howbeit I will moue the reſt of my Lords in the matter, and what may be done, ſhall be done. But vpon theſe and ſuch like fooliſh and blaſphemous ſpeeches, neuer anie Commiſſioner made inquirie: and thus departed hee out of the Parler, wherein he had made ſuch a clerke-like peece of worke to the poore priſoners in way of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo like a gay-diuine, caſting a word out to the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17938:74"/>
keeper verie ſolemnly, and charging him by vertue of their Office to look to them narrowly, that none eſcaped. For if there did, he ſhould both ſeek them at his owne charge, and be puniſhed beſides for his negligence, in looking ſo ſlenderly to his duetie.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere be alſo certaine ſpeciall termes which the <hi>holy Houſe</hi> vſeth for euerie kinde of penance ſeuerally. Wherein, ſeeing there lyeth alſo ſorne ſecret myſterie, it ſhall not bee greatly impertinent to declare them in this place, expounding them after the Inquiſitours owne ſenſe and vnderſtanding. Firſt, concerning the iudgements, ſome are to bee <hi>burned quicke,</hi> and that is for ſuch as haue conſtantly perſeuered vnto the end, in the confeſſion of a pure and perfect faith: and theſe men they call <hi>obstinate.</hi> Others are to bee <hi>burned</hi> alſo, but <hi>after they be dead,</hi> being firſt ſtrangled at the ſtake. Such are they, that being once wonne by their owne frailtie and weakneſſe, haue beene content to ſubmitte themſelues to the Inquiſitours, and to footh wahtſoeuer the other will ſay, &amp; yet haue by certaine euident and ſufficient tokens, giuen the Inquiſitours good cauſe of ſuſpicion, to thinke that they remaine the ſame in heart ſtill, notwithſtanding their mouth hath confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the contrarie. After the ſame maner are diuers alſo of the former ſort, whom they tearme <hi>obstinate,</hi> ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ere the fire bee kindled, to make the people beleeue, that ſo ſoone as they were ſette to the ſtake, they abiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and renouced all their hereſies, and returned to the holy mother-Church of Rome. But of theſe I haue made mention before. Another ſort of <hi>ſentences</hi> there are that haue a ſhew of more mercie, which they call <hi>reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> becauſe ſuch as haue renounced the truth are as it were purged and clenſed by doing that penance in way of ſatisfaction, and therby receiued againe into the very boſom of the Romiſh Church. Such for the moſt part cary
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:17938:74"/>
in their hands tapers vnlighted on the great day of their Triumph, with ropes about their neckes, and <hi>Sambenites</hi> vpon their backes aboue their other garments, as badges &amp; tokens of guilt: &amp; theſe they wear either during life, or for ſome other certaine number of yeares, or elſe are cloſe kept and ſhut vp in ſome monaſterie, or ſome other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate places, whereof as there be ſundry ſortes, ſo are there likewiſe ſeuerall names. Some are Perpetuall without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Some onely perpetuall. Some for a certaine ſeaſon: the which beeng expired, they muſt notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remaine there ſtill, during the Inquiſitours pleaſures: and ſome be no longer limited at the firſt than during the pleaſure of the chiefe Inquiſitour, the Generall they call him, becauſe he is chiefe Iudge aboue all other Courts of the holy Inquiſition throughout the Realme of <hi>Spaine:</hi> there be alſo ſome at the pleaſure of the inferiour Iudges that gaue the ſentence, in their owne Courts and priuate iuriſdictions. Theſe diuerſities of priſons are like the properties of Purgatorie for all the world, excepting aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well certaine caſes in matter of penance, as alſo degrees of affinitie and bloud in caſes of mariage. For they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed to glean all the mony out of the poor Penitentiaries purſes, more or leſſe, according to the quality of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and after the rate and proportion of the penalty aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed on each of them therefore. And all this (forſooth) muſt bee vnderſtood to proceede from the Inquiſitours owneclemencie and mercie, of their own meer good will: by the only meanes whereof, the party that otherwiſe muſt neceſſarely periſh for abiuring the truth, may ſtand in ſtate of grace againe, and be in poſſibilitie to recouer his owne ſaluation.</p>
               <p>When iudgement is giuen to weare the <hi>Habite,</hi> (for ſo they call the <hi>Sambenite</hi> by a more cleanly terme) &amp; to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall priſon without bayle or mainepriſe, it is to be vnderſtood, that there is no talk to be had of any remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof till the party hath worn that garment, &amp; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:17938:75"/>
impriſonment, the ſpace of nine or ten whole yeares, except the partie haue ſo good hap, as by meanes of his friends to obtaine his pardon at the Kings hand, who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may by his prerogatiue pardon it at his pleaſure. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the expiration of thoſe yeares, vnleſſe the party haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſome cauſe of ſuſpicion againe, the chiefe Inquiſitour is commonly wont to remitte the reſidue, howbeit with great crouching firſt, and much entreatie.</p>
               <p>When they adiudge a man to weare the <hi>Sambenite,</hi> and to ſuffer perpetuall impriſonment, without adding anie more, it is commonly taken for 3. yeares. if the chiefe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor doe ſo think good: vpon whoſe pleaſure it reſteth either to giue the priſoner his diſcharge after thoſe 3 years; or elſe to his perpetuall ignominie, there to detaine him all his life long. But when they ſay, that a man ſhall wear the <hi>Habite,</hi> and ſuffer impriſonment ſo many yeares or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, ſo ſoon as that certaine time is expired the partie is ſet at libertie, except it be added moreouer, beſides the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of time certaine, that it ſhal be further referred to the diſcretion and appointment of the Inquiſitours. The which clauſe they comonly vſe to put in the latter end, in the winding vp of all, to choake men therewith, to make them thinke themſelues much bound to them while they liue, for releaſing the ſame. But if the ſentence be to weare the <hi>Sambenite</hi> with impriſonment during the chiefe Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours pleaſure, it is left to their diſcretions to pardon or puniſh accordingly, as they ſhall think good. In ſumme, how or after what ſort ſoeuer their ſentence be, the matter is wholly referred to them and to their ordering.</p>
               <p>Now the meanes to redeeme this impriſonment, and to diſpenſe with the wearing of theſe robes, is the more common and ordinarie, by reaſon that the King hath in his Court diuers young gentlemen, to whom in reſpect of their ſeruice, he vſeth to grant pardons for thoſe matters. Then ſuch as get the grant hereof, doe commonly make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie for ſuch perſons as are therunto adiudged, who they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:17938:75"/>
be, and where they remaine, to the intent to make their market of thoſe pardons to their moſt aduantage, as they can agree of price eyther more or leſſe, reſpecting alwaies, both the abilitie of the perſon, and the qualitie of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. For ſuch as had iudgement without redemption, pay more: other for releaſe of perpetuall impriſonment, leſſe: other for certaine time and during the Inquiſitours pleaſure, leſſe againe: and leaſt of all, that which onely reſteth vpon the diſcretion and will of the Iudge. Alſo, at ſome times the King, of his like liberality &amp; gracious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vſeth to grant vnto diuerſe, ſuch money as ſhould bee leuied for pardon of the <hi>Sambenite</hi> and other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, towards the redeeming of their brethren and allies, being taken priſoners by the Turkes or Moores. And yet, whoſoeuer ſueth vnto the King for anie ſuch pardon, muſt firſt in any caſe make the Inquiſitours and the Clerks or other Officers of that Court his friends: otherwiſe, both the Kings owne charter, and the payment made by the partie beſides notwithſtanding, they will auoide him by hooke or by crooke, and tell him plainly, be it the King or the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelfe that granted the pardon, he muſt bee better enformed how the caſe ſtandeth ere he may depart ſo lightly. Then, if the matter be brought to that paſſe, it is an eaſie thing for them to imagine, that the partie is not ſo cleared, but that there was good cauſe a while to make a ſtay.</p>
               <p>But when anie hath iudgement of Impriſonment during the chiefe Inquiſitours pleaſure, who for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſecret occaſions to him knowne will not bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, and yet cannot well with honeſtie repulſe the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, albeit hee doe them manifeſt iniurie to detaine them ſo long, hee will conuey the matter full cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly, ſaying, that he is content to referre it to the Inquiſitours by whom the iudgement was giuen. And when the partie reſorteth to them, then ſtraight-way is he poſted ouer from them backe againe to the high
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17938:76"/>
Inquiſitor, alledging that the determination hereof belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vnto him, and ſo by meanes that one of them vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth the others meaning, they dally and prolong the poor mans impriſonment, driuing him off from day to day, ſo long as it pleaſeth them. In like maner, the puniſhment is limited by the inferiour Inquiſitours. For when they are loth to be entreated, they paſs it to the high Inquiſitor, and ſo one of them ſerueth another: and therefore except the partie goe cunningly to worke, and bribe eyther the Clerke or ſome other Officer of the <hi>holy Houſe</hi> &amp; that with no ſmall gubbe, and there begin the ground of his ſute, all his labour and coſt beſtowed vpon the redeeming of his impriſonment, is quite loſt. But if any of the Inquiſitors or any chiefe Officer of the Court doe make interceſſion for the partie, then ſtraight-way the other vnderſtand, that it is done vpon ſome ſuch ſpeciall occaſions as they know, whereupon the ſuter is moued to pittie the ſtate of the poor priſoner, ſpecially if he vſe the ordinary words known and vſed among themſelues in caſes of petition. Which is on this ſort. <hi rend="margQuotes">My very good Lordes, my humble ſute to your good Lordſhips is, that ſuch a priſoners cauſe may bee fauourably conſidered, of whoſe good life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, but ſpecially of his patience in the time of his impriſonment, I haue beene ſufficiently and ſubſtantially enformed.</hi> Here are intermedled two or three good words in his commendation, but moderately, leſt it ſhould be thought that hee were too carefull ouer him: <hi rend="margQuotes">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion then is, that it would pleaſe their Lordſhips to determine, whether the partie ſhall bee releaſed yea or no.</hi> And of ſuch as eſcape thus hardly through the bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars, it coſteth ſome the one halfe of their goods: ſome all: and ſome a peece, as it pleaſeth the Inquiſitours to deale with them. For they are perſwaded this to be the nigheſt way to bring them home again, that are any thing gone aſtray or become aliens from the faith. Or perhaps the <hi>holy Houſe</hi> thinketh it to be againſt Gods Lawes, that an
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17938:76"/>
hereticke ſhould haue whereupon to liue. Or elſe belike, they haue found out an <hi>Aphoriſme</hi> for their purpoſe: that as a ſurfetter muſt vſe a temperate and a thin diet: ſo muſt an heretick alſo be kept low, leſt he ſwell and grow vp therein; and therefore take it for a ſoueraigne medicine, to keepe him ſo hungrie that he muſt be faine to begge his bread.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, of theſe (as is aboueſaid) ſome haue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, beſides the wearing of the habite and ſuffring impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, to be alſo whipped. Some both to be whipped, &amp; afterward ſet to the <hi>Gally.</hi> But theſe ſharper kinds of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they commonly vſe to ſtrangers, be they neuer ſo ſmall offenders, to bee euen with them this way, becauſe they make ſo light of wearing the <hi>Sambenite,</hi> for moſt of them make but a ieſt of it. And all theſe proceed from the Inquiſitours owne mercie.</p>
               <p>The laſt and leaſt penaltie is appointed for ſuch as in their iudgements haue committed but a light offence: that is, to bee brought vpon the ſcaffold bare-headed and without anie cloake, hauing in his hand a waxe taper: whereof ſome are commanded to make Abiuration <hi>ex ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hementi:</hi> Some <hi>ex levi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Abiuration <hi>de vehementi</hi> they call, when it appeared not in the hearing and debating of anie mans cauſe, what is certainely to bee determined, for want of ſufficient proofe, and becauſe the partie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe confeſſed nothing that deſerued anie maner of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Therefore vpon ſuch a fellow, whom they may neyther by iuſtice condemne for an hereticke, nor of their conſciences can abſolue and ſet at libertie, ſpecially hauing ſome apparant tokens of ſcarce good beliefe, they giue ſentence vpon him as vpon one vehemently ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: and ſo according to their ſuſpicion, they cauſe him to abiure, And ſuch a man being afterward found guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, be it in the leaſt tittle of papiſtrie, they take for a relapſe, and condemne to the fire. Abiuration <hi>de levi,</hi> is much after the ſame maner, but that it is enioined vpon ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:17938:77"/>
offences in their iudgements, whether the matter hath been apparant or no. Howbeit, no ſuch perſon, though he be taken with the ſame maner againe, ſhall be reputed for a relapſe, or haue iudgement of death therefore: albeit the qualifying of the ſecond offence, that is to ſay, the iudgement and eſtimation thereof, bee referred to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitours. And this kinde of abiuration is for the moſt part vſed in other matters, then concerning Luthers do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as for example, fornication (forſooth) betwixt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle perſons, as though it were no ſin: therefore it is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomably puniſhed but as a trifling toy, by carrying of a waxe candle, and by abiuration <hi>deleui.</hi> Yet at ſome times they puniſh this ſin with the whip, and that verie extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but if the party offend a thouſand times after, ſo that he put himſelfe vpon the Inquiſitours mercie, he is ſure neuer to dye therefore.</p>
               <p>Loe, theſe be the goodly means wherby theſe good fathers bring into the right way the weaklings, as <hi>Paul</hi> tearmeth them. And thus much concerning their deuices practiſed in the Inquiſition, till the time come that we may ſee the fall of that arke of Iniquitie, with the hidden ſecrets and myſteries thereof further diſcloſed, and all thoſe things ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled and accompliſhed, which in time (no doubt) muſt be reuealed and come to paſſe vpon this holy Inquiſition, theſe good Fathers, and their holy Houſe, finally vpon the whole man of ſin, which God threatneth by his Prophet, ſhall fall vpon all ſuch wicked hypocrites, which to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowing of Chriſt's kingdome, and the vtter defacing of his glory, like ſhameleſſe men, moſt wickedly do pretend the defence, and zeale, and the earneſt aduancement of the ſame. <hi>Malach. 2.

               </argument>
               <p>HEre I haue thought good to annexe certaine ſpeciall examples of their practices; wherein a man may eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſee a great ſort of their treacheries heaped and ſhuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled together, ouer and aboue ſuch as I haue heretofore made relation of in their ſpeciall places, to the end that their crueltie in the execution hereof, with their vnſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble couetouſneſſe, and all other abominable iniquitie in the peruerting of all good lawes, may bee liuely deſcribed and (as it were) painted in tables, and ſet foorth to the ſhew, that ſuch as doe behold them may take the full view thereof. And partly I doe it for their ſakes, who for the profeſſing of the Goſpel, and the abiuring of an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable religion, haue bin ouertaken by the ſame meanes, ſeruing theſe holy Fathers in ſtead of a booty to prey and rauen vpon, becauſe I think it expedient for the Church to continue ſome memorie therof. Now therfore, let all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome open their eyes, that they may know &amp; diſcerne theſe rauenous Wolues, Lions, &amp; Dragons, the very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Vipers, whom (notwithſtanding their tyrannie) they haue till this day had in great reputation, and honored as gods, to the great decay and vndoing of all Chriſtian common-weales: that learning to know them, and ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them out off their clokes of piety &amp; godlineſſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they haue gotten ſpeciall commendation, they may ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them all Chriſtendome ouer. But as for any examples whereof I mean preſently to make rehearſall, they are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of one onely Court of the Inquiſition holden at <hi>Siuill,</hi> whoſe ſecrets alone the reporters hereof were able
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:17938:78"/>
to diſcloſe, hauing had the moſt part of them practiſed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelues, By relation whereof, a man may haue a pretty geſs, what a number there would be if a man ſhould likewiſe courſe ouer all the other Courts of Inquiſition throughout the whole realme of Spaine. Neither are theſe that hereafter enſue, or the other reported before in my whole treatiſe, of any long collection: but all within the compaſſe of 6. or 7. yeares next after they began to perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Lutherans that grew vp in Spaine in great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes vpon a ſuddaine, eſpecially in <hi>Siuill</hi> and <hi>Valladolit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> time there was apprehended for religion, and brought before the Inquiſitors of <hi>Siuill,</hi> a certaine En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman whoſe name was <hi>Nicholas Burton,</hi> a very godly man, whom afterward they burned for that he continued conſtant in his profeſſion &amp; belief, deteſting vtterly all their wicked &amp; abominable religion vntill his liues end. Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after his arreſt, all the goods and Marchandiſe which he brought with him into Spain by way of traffick, were according to their common vſage ſeaſed and taken into the <hi>Sequeſter:</hi> among the which they alſo rolled vp much that appertained to another Engliſh Marchant, wherewith hee was credited as Factour. Whereof ſo ſoone as newes was brought to London, aſwell of the impriſonment of his Factour, as of the Arreſt made vpon his goods, hee ſent his Atturney into Spaine with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie from him to make claime to his goods, and demand them. When his Atturney was landed at <hi>Siuill,</hi> and had ſhewed all his letters and writings to the holy Houſe, requiring them, that ſuch goods might bee deliuered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his poſſeſſion, anſwer was made him, that hee muſt ſue by bill, and retaine an <hi>Aduocate</hi> (but all was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe to delay him) and they, forſooth, of curteſie aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him one to frame his ſupplication for him, and other ſuch billes of petition as hee had to exhibite into their holy Court, demanding for each bill eight rialls, albeit they ſtood him in no more ſtead than if hee had put vp
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:17938:78"/>
none at all. And for the ſpace of three or four moneths this fellow miſſed not twice a day, attending euery mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and afternoon at the Inquiſitors Palace, ſuing vnto them vpon his knees for his diſpatch, but ſpecially to the Biſhop of <hi>Tarracon</hi> of whom I made mention before, who was at that very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>me chief in the Inquiſition at <hi>Siuill,</hi> that he of his abſolute authoritie would command reſtitution to be made therof: but the booty was ſo good &amp; ſo great, that it was the harder to come by it againe. At the length, after he had ſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t whole four moneths in ſutes &amp; requeſts, &amp; all to no purpoſe, he receiued this anſwer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, that he muſt ſhew better euidence, &amp; bring more ſufficient cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates out of England for proofe of his matter, than thoſe which he hath already preſented to the Court. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the party forthwith poſted to London, and with all ſpeed returned to <hi>Siuill</hi> againe with more ample and large letters teſtimonialls and certificates, according to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and exhibited them to the Court. Notwithſtanding, the Inquiſitors ſtil ſhifted him off, excuſing themſelues by lack of leiſure, &amp; by occupation in greater &amp; more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty affaires, and with ſuch anſwers delayed him whole other 4. moneths after. At the laſt, when the party had welnigh ſpent all his money, and therefore ſued the more earneſtly for his diſpatch, they referred the matter wholly to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. Of whom, when hee repaired vnto him, hee had this anſwer: that for himſelfe hee knew what hee had to doe: howbeit hee was but one man, and the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter appertained vnto the other commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners aſwell as vnto him: and by thus poſting &amp; paſſing it from one to another, the partie could obtain no end of his ſute. Yet for his importunitie ſake, they were reſolued to diſpatch him, but it was on this ſort: One of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitours called <hi>Licentiato Gaſco,</hi> a man verie well expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in theſe practices, willed the party to reſort vnto him after dinner. The fellow being glad to hear this newes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuppoſing that his goods ſhould be reſtored vnto him,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:17938:79"/>
and that he was called in for that purpoſe to talk with the other that were in priſon, to confer with him about their accounts, the rather through a little miſunderſtanding, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Inquiſitor caſt out a word, that it ſhould be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for him to talk with the priſoner; and being thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more than halfe perſwaded, that at the length they meant good faith, did ſo, and repaired thither about the euening. Immediately vpon his comming, the Iayler was forthwith charged with him, to ſhut him vp cloſe in ſuch a certain priſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where they appointed him. The party ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at the firſt that he had bin called for about ſome other matter, and ſeeing himſelfe contrary to his expectation, caſt into a dark dungeon, perceiued at the length that the world went with him far otherwiſe then hee ſuppoſed it would haue done. But within two or three dayes after, he was brought forth into the Court, where hee began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his goods: and becauſe it was a deuice that well ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their turne, without any more circumſtance they bid him ſay his <hi>Aue Maria.</hi> The party began, and ſaid it ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and plainely on this ſort, after the Engliſh faſhion: <hi>Aue Maria gratia plena dominiu tecum, benedictatu in mulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus, &amp; benedictus fructus ventris tui Ieſus. Amen.</hi> The ſame was written word by word as hee ſpake it: and without anie more talke of claiming his goods, becauſe it was booteleſſe, they command him to priſon againe, and enter an action againſt him as an hereticke, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as hee did not ſay his <hi>Aue Maria</hi> after the Romiſh faſhion, but ended it very ſuſpiciouſly; for hee ſhould haue added moreouer <hi>Sancta Maria mater dei ora pro nobis peccatoribus:</hi> by curtalling whereof, it was euident enough (ſay they) that hee did not allow the mediation of Saints. Thus they picked a quarrell to detaine him in priſon a longer ſeaſon, and afterwards brought him forth into their Stage diſguiſed after their maner: where ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was giuen, that hee ſhould loſe all the goods which he ſued for, though they were not his owne, &amp; beſides this

               </p>
               <p>In the confiſcation of goods, it is neither any great noueltie, nor a thing ſo rarely ſeene in this <hi>holy Houſe,</hi> that ſtrangers goods ſhould bee alſo ſeiſed among other mens. Otherwiſe (ſay they) it might eaſily bee wrought, if they ſhould giue eare or credit to ſuch allegations, that manie by meanes thereof might colour their goods vnder ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans name, and by ſome falſe and forged Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates proue them to appertaine to other men, and ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the Kings Eſchecquer. For remedy whereof, and for the better auoiding of all couerts &amp; colluſions, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Houſe thinketh it the ſafer way to offer wrong than to ſuffer any. As within theſe few yeares there arriued at <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill</hi> a certaine rich Marchant ſtranger, whoſe goods were afterwaad confiſcate for religion. Among the which they ſeiſed a very faire and a goodly ſhip, ſuch one, as by all mens iudgements, there neuer rode a better nor a fairer vpon the riuer. The party brought ſufficient proofe that the ſhip was none of his owne, &amp; yet notwithſtanding the Inquiſitours found a meanes that the law went on their ſides, ſo that the ſhip fell out in triall to be theirs. And this Marchants name was <hi>Reuchino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, in the ſame Court of Inquiſition at <hi>Siuill,</hi> there was one of the Citizens, a verie godly and a vertuous man, ſeuerely perſecuted by the Inquiſitours for religion, howbeit not executed therefore. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other of his puniſhments, this was one peece: that all his goods whereon hee liued and maintained himſelfe, reaſonably well and honeſtly among his neighbours, ſhould bee wholly conſiſcate, and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitied to cloſe priſon for tenne yeares. Wherein, after he had remained by the ſpace of two or three daies, liuing there full barely (God wot) of a poor ſtock, that diuers wel diſpoſed perſons had gathered for him of their deuotion, hauing ſomtine liued in reaſonable good eſtate; one of the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:17938:80"/>
Notaries of the Inquiſition, came vnto him with a bill ſigned and ſubſcribed by the Inquiſitours, charging him to pay to the Notaries hands 130. ducates for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and other expenſes, during the time of his aboad in <hi>Triana</hi> their priſon for the Inquiſition. The partie made anſwer (as the truth was) that thoſe good Fathers had taken from him all that euer he had, ſo that nothing was left him; and where nothing was, they could haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Howbeit this anſwer contented not the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, but they ſent the Notarie vnto him once againe, ſtraitly charging him either to pay the mony out of hand, or elſe to bee remoued from that priuate place, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the common iayle, and there to remaine till he had diſcharged it. What mad fooles were theſe, to confiſcate all his goods, and charge themſelues by account for them into the Eſchequer, not foreſeeing to demand allowance for his charges?</p>
               <p>About the ſame time wel-neer, the Houſe of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Siuill</hi> apprehended a certaine noble woman, whoſe name was <hi>Ioanna Bohorquia,</hi> the Lady and wife of one <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco Varquio,</hi> a noble gentleman, and baron of <hi>Higuera,</hi> daughter to one <hi>Pedro Garſia Xereſio</hi> a very rich Citizen of <hi>Siuill.</hi> The cauſe of her trouble was, for that a ſiſter of hers called <hi>Maria Bohorquia,</hi> a very vertuous virgine, and one that afterwards was burned for her profeſſion and faith, had confeſſed in the extreamitie of her torments, that ſhe had conference with her ſiſter in theſe matters of religion diuers times. This Lady, when ſhee was firſt committed to priſon, was gone with childe well-nigh halfe a yeare: in reſpect whereof, neyther did they ſhut her vp ſo cloſe, nor dealt with her otherwiſe ſo hardly, as they vſed to deale with others, for the regard of that that was within her. Notwithſtanding, within foure dayes after her deliuerance, they tooke the childe away from her, and the ſeuenth day next after, they ſhut her vp in cloſe priſon againe, entreating her in all things as they did the other
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:17938:80"/>
priſoners, and with as much cruelty as they vſed to any: in ſo much that in all her miſeries the only comfort that ſhe had, was, of the good company of a certaine vertuous maiden that was her fellow priſoner for a time, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes ſent to the ſtake. Vnto whom ſhe bare ſuch good will, that being on a time caried foorth to the racke, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caried to priſon, ſore ſtrained thereon and ſo ſhaken in peeces, that hauing a bed of flags which ſerued them both to couch on, more painefull a great deale then eaſefull, whereon ſhee tumbled her ſelfe ſo well as ſhee could (though hardly God knowes, and to her great paine and griefe) the good Lady being not in caſe able to do her any other good, yet did ſhee inwardly ſhew ſingular tokens of loue and compaſſion towards her. The ſame maid was ſcarſe recouered, or her ioynts well knit againe, but the ſaid Lady was likewiſe caried out to bee ſerued in the ſame ſort, &amp; was ſo terribly tormented in the <hi>Burrie</hi> &amp; <hi>Trough,</hi> that by reaſon of the exceding ſtrait ſtraining of the ſtrings pearcing to the very bones of her arms, thighes, &amp; ſhinnes, ſhe was carried to priſon halfe dead and more, the bloud guſhing out of her mouth amaine, and in ſo great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that it could not bee otherwiſe, but that ſomewhat was broken within her body: but after 8. daies God deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered her from theſe rauening Lions, and ſet her with himſelfe in euerlaſting reſt and peace. The bruit of which fact the Inquiſitours laboured earneſtly to ſuppreſſe, leſt it ſhould be noiſed abroad among the common people, that they had ſo villanouſly torne in peeces this tender Lady vpon the racke: but the beholders of this their tyranny could not hold it in. Now ſurely, if ſhee had been a witch, or a traitor to her husband, or a murderer of her owne children, and the temporall Magiſtrate had dealt ſo with her to make her confeſſe theſe horible factes, what time hee were to giue vp his accompts (as the maner is) hee ſhould pay for it full dearely, if ſo bee that hee had thus cruelly and without all reaſon entreated any perſon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:17938:81"/>
Yet the holy Houſe is not to yeeld accompt of any ſuch matters, but may racke to death euen ſuch, whom they themſelues after more preciſe and exact proofe, do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit for innocents, and eſcape ſcotfree therfore, as it came to paſs in the example of this vertuous lady. For being one of ſuch eſtate, and of ſo good name and fame that they muſt neceſſarily yeld ſome accompt of her caſe vnto the common people, and were deſtitute of proofes ſufficient (though they had left no deuice or policy vnpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they could imagine) ſeeing the matter ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to all the world, that by no meanes it could bee diſſembled: therefore the very firſt day of their next Triumph, they cauſed their ſentence which they had giuen vpon her, to be openly read there vnto the people one this wiſe: Foraſmuch as this Lady died in priſon (without ſhewing how or by what meanes I warrant you) and vpon diligent hearing and conſideration of her cauſe, is found innocent: therefore the <hi>holy houſe</hi> doth wholly acquit and diſcharge her of all ſuites and quarrels commenced againſt her by the <hi>Fiſcal,</hi> and doth reſtore her to her former eſtate of eſtimation and honour, abſoluing her clearely from all guilt and crime: and thereupon doo command, that reſtitution be made of all ſuch goods as were ſeiſed into the <hi>Sequeſter,</hi> vnto the hands of ſuch perſons as haue right and title thereunto, &amp;c. Thus, after that they had moſt beaſtly murdered her on the rack, they made her this goodly amends, to denounce her not guilty. God will one day (no doubt) aske an accompte of this their beaſtly and barbarous tyranny, ſith they maintaine it by the ſame power and authoritie in earth, which he hath ordeined, for the reuenge of theſe and ſuch like iniuries.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, not long after it happened, that the <hi>holie houſe</hi> was aduiſed and fully bent to lay their baites and ſpread their nets in certaine quarters there: but if they had not vpon better aduiſement afterward wound them vp againe, they themſelues vnawares had giuen Rome
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:17938:81"/>
ſuch a gird, as I beleeue all the Lutherans hitherto haue not giuen it a greater. And thus it was. There were certain perſons, that were much more buſie than I beleeue they had thanke for, which found great fault with a foule companie Monkes and other religious men, for abuſing their auricular Confeſsion; vnder the colour thereof, masking with honeſt matrons and maydens that reſorted vnto them, making it a meanes to breake their ſutes by, and to compaſſe their purpoſes. The which thing the <hi>holy Houſe</hi> thought indeede worthie of conſideration and redreſſe. But foraſmuch as it was a hard to know who were theſe wooers and brokers, where none was appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſpecially and by name (as it happeneth in a matter wherein a multitude offendeth) they cauſed proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to bee made throughout all the Churches within the prouince of <hi>Siuill</hi> verie ſolemnly, that whoſoeuer knew of their owne certaine knowledge, or had heard by report of others, of anie Monkes or other religious or ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all perſons (as they call them) that had abuſed their holy ſacrament of Confeſſion, to anie ſuch abominable actes or enterpriſes, or that anie other ghoſtly Father had dealt in anie ſuch like ſort with anie of his ſhrift children, that euerie ſuch perſon and perſons priuie to anie ſuch matters, ſhould come in within thirtie dayes, &amp; ſignifie it to the holy Houſe of Inquiſition; enioining moreouer, verie great penalties for ſuch as ſhould refuſe or contemne to come in accordingly, and to make declaration, what they were able to ſay: The proclamation was no ſooner made and publiſhed, but there came ſuch a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of women, onely inhabitants within the citie of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,</hi> to complaine of their ghoſtly Fathers, that twentie Notaries, and as many Inquiſitors would not haue ſufficed to take the names of ſuch as came in and entred their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints: wherfore the Inquiſitors, hauing more to doe than well they could diſpatch, gaue them other thirtie dayes come in and doe the like. But becauſe ſo little time
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:17938:82"/>
would not ſerue (they came in ſo thick) they gaue them ſo much more reſpite againe the third time: and after that the fourth, and there they were enformed to lay a ſtraw. For very many honeſt matrons and of good calling, partly of a fooliſh feare and ſuperſtition, leſt they ſhould bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and partly in reſpect of their husbands whom they were loth to offend and bring into a iealouſie or ſuſpicion of their honeſties, kept themſelues at home, thinking to eſpie better ſome oportunitie to ſpeake with the Inquiſitours apart. Whereupon they they attired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with vailes or mufflers after the maner of their country, &amp; went to the holy houſe as priuily as they could. Notwithſtanding, their husbands did ſo narrowly watch them during all the time of this appeaching, that they could not poſſibly paſſe ſo priuily but diuers of them were eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whereby they occaſioned their husbands vehemently to ſuſpect their honeſties. On the other ſide, it was a iolly ſport to ſee the Monkes and Friers and Prieſts goe vp and downe hanging downe their heads, all in dump and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly, by meanes of their guiltie conſciences, quaking and trembling, and looking euery howre when ſome of the Familiars ſhould take them by the ſleeue, &amp; call them in <hi>Coram</hi> for theſe matters. Inſomuch that a number feared leſt as great a plague were come among them, as the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution that was ſo hot about that time againſt the Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans. But the Inquiſitours perceiuing that theſe matters thus purpoſed, would ſound not onely to the great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of themſelues, but alſo turne to the decay of the whole Church of Rome, and that this onely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe of theirs, if it ſhould goe on and take effect, would bee enough to bring all their ſpiritualtie into vtter hatred &amp; obloquie, but ſpecially tend to the diſcredit of their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confeſſion, which began alreadie to be but of ſmall account, although it was a matter that otherwiſe deſerued both ſtraitly to be examined, and ſeuerely to be puniſhed: yet did they in time take it vp, and made a ſtay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:17938:82"/>
contrary to all mens expectations: winding vp all theſe matters, whereof the Court was now orderly and lawfully ſeiſed. And as the report was, the Monkes and Prieſts made a common purſe, &amp; with a good round ſumme grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Pope in the hand, ſo that he was content to grant a general pardon to all the whole company of Confeſſors, of his fatherly love and affection towards them, remitting all offences done or committed by them, &amp; commanding the Inquiſitours to ſurceaſe from proceeding any further, but wholly to ſuppreſs ſuch things as were paſſed alreadie, not ſuffering them in anie caſe to come to light. Howbeit thoſe that are priuy to the Inquiſitours dealings, ſay it is an vnlikely matter, affirming, that if the Pope ſhould make any ſuch grant, yet is the <hi>holy Inquiſition</hi> of ſuch preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, that if they take in hand any matter of weight, they will not ſurceaſe vpon the Popes inhibition or countermanding, and that it is oftener ſeene, that their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie preuaileth againſt the Popes, than his againſt them, as by this example following may more plainely appeare.</p>
               <p>Not paſſing two yeares before this, the Biſhop of Rome had by a like fooliſh part and vnawares cut the Inquiſitors combes, by publiſhing a generall <hi>Iubily,</hi> which they call a generall charter of pardon, for the ſafetie of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, becauſe Chriſt belike did not ſufficiently prouide therefore, beſides a number of other pardons &amp; indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for ſuch as were ſuſpected to be Lutherans: ſo cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can this fellow make a gaine of the Goſpel to himſelfe. And wheras he cannot auoid the dart that Chriſt hath ſent into the world to plague him withall, but that he muſt be ſtricken therwith, he ceaſeth not to turn it ſome way to his owne aduantage. The words of the pardon were theſe: That whoſo in time paſt had been a Lutheran, and would forſake that ſect, might be abſolued thereof by his ghoſtly father. An old deuice of the diuell, that in as much as there aroſe about the ſame time great trouble in Spaine, but ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:17938:83"/>
in <hi>Siuill</hi> the chiefe city thereof, and that a number of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended therein, and began now to ſhrink from them, they might the more quietly and with leſſe danger keepe them in obedience, going about to win them by a kinde of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie and mercie, though fained and counterfait, rather then by dealing with them ſtraitly or ſeuerely. Howbeit, here was nothing found fault withall ſaue only the preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicing of the holy Houſe, whereof as it ſeemed, the Pope had no great regard. Whereupon, they of the Inquiſition being ſomwhat moued, by reaſon that that one only clauſe had loſt them a good booty, contemned the <hi>Popes pardon,</hi> &amp; reſiſted it with might and maine, commanding peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily, that no ſuch pardon ſhould be publiſhed, as ſhould turne the holy Houſe to any preiudice: by meanes wherof neither was it receiued ne proclaimed. Loe, heer may a man ſee Sathan diuided againſt himſelfe, and perceiue thereby, that this denying of the Popes abſolute authoritie, which theſe good gentlemen puniſh in others with fire &amp; ſword, as being a neceſſary article of our beliefe, is but a noſe of waxe, which they turne what way they liſt: ſo that it ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them rather in ſtead of a trap to entangle vs withall, then accounted of as an article of our faith, in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation whereof conſiſteth our ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The propertie of euerie tyrant is, ſpecially to hate both mercie and truth, and to vſe all crueltie and extremity that may be: or elſe to ſeek vtterly to be hated, when he ſeeth there is none other meanes to vphold him. As it was ſaid ſometime by one: Whom men fear, they doe but hate. And truly, if a man be diſpoſed to mark them well, he ſhall eaſily perceiue, that there hath bin hitherto no tyrant, that hath more duely obſerued theſe lawes, nor executed them more cruelly, than this holy Houſe hath done, deuiſing to doe all iniury and extremity that poſſibly they can, onely to bring men in feare and awe of them: ſo that they ſeem to deſire nothing ſo much as this; that all men may fear them, hate them who dare, foraſmuch as they puniſh trifling to ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and matters of no importance, yea ſuch as are ſcarce blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, moſt ſeuerely and beyond all meaſure, as by the examples here enſuing may appeare moſt manifeſtly.</p>
               <p>At what time their Church was in ſo good and quiet eſtate, that the Inquiſitors had leiſure enough to take their pleaſure abroad, it chanced that the Biſhop of <hi>Tarracon</hi> high commiſſioner in the Inquiſition at <hi>Siuill</hi> (of whoſe holineſſe I haue made mention before) walked in a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers day for his recreation by the ſweet gardens that ſtand by the Riuer <hi>Guadalqueuir,</hi> accompanied with all his traine and in his ſtate as he was wont at diuers other times to do. Hard vpon the banke of a certaine pond that was in the ſame garden, where my Lord Biſhop at that time was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creating himſelfe, by chance there ſat a little child playing, that was the gardiners ſonne, not paſſing two or three yeares of age, out of whoſe hands one of the Inquiſitours Pages hapned to ſnatch a reede wherewith the child was making himſelfe ſport, as children are wont to doe, by meanes whereof the child cryed after his reede. Tke fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hearing the child cry, came ſtraight-way to know the cauſe, and vnderſtanding it, was ſomewhat offended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, &amp; prayed the Biſhops Page to giue the little child his reed againe: but becauſe he made little account of the gardiners words, proudly ſcorning and diſdaining the poore man, he offred to ſnatch it from him, and by reaſon that he held ſomewhat hard, a ſhiuer of the reed raced the Pages hand. It was no deaths wound I wis, nor any great maime, ſuch as ſhould deſerue anie great puniſhment, but only a ſmall ſcratch, like as a broken reed could make; I wot not well what to make of it, nor how to deſcribe it: ſuch a thing as the verie childe would haue made no mone for. The Page yet goeth to his Lord that walked not far off, to make complaint of this bloudſhed. Whoſe Lordſhip commanded, that the gardiner ſhould bee taken immediately and carried to <hi>Triana,</hi> where hee was laden with irons, and there continued by the ſpace of nine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:17938:84"/>
and in the end loſt that little that hee had: which was not much God knows, and yet a hard thing for the poor man to recouer and get before hand againe, his wife and children perhaps ſtaruing in the mean time. And all this was only becauſe he had no ſpeciall regard to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Page, in forbearing him as a member of the holy Houſe: but after the 9. moneths hee releaſed him, making him beleeue, that he had dealt with him in much more gentle and mild ſort, than his caſe deſerued.</p>
               <p>There was alſo in <hi>Siuill</hi> a certaine poore man that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for his owne liuing, and for his whole familie full duely and truely, and with the ſweat of his browes, whoſe wife a certaine Church-man kept againſt his will, and neyther the holy Inquiſition, nor anie other Court would puniſh this villanie. This poore man on a time being among his companions, where one of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie miniſtred talke about purgatorie, and happened to take his tale by the end, of meer ſimplicitie, rather then of anie malice, and to ſay, that hee had purgatorie enough for his ſhare in that a vile knaue kept his wife from him perforce, &amp;c. the which talke comming to the good Prieſts eare, gaue him matter enough to worke vpon, and to procure the poore man a double diſpleaſure. Whereupon he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to the holy Houſe, as one holding an euill opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of purgatorie. And they thought this a great deale more heynous offence, than the wicked fact of the Prieſt. For the poore ſoule for this onely offence was taken and thruſt into priſon, where he remained two whole yeares together, and at the length was brought vpon the ſtage, and had iudgement to wear the <hi>Sambenite,</hi> by the ſpace of of 3. yeares more, in ſome priuate place of impriſonment; and after that time expired, to be diſmiſſed or further retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as the Inquiſitours ſhould thinke good. Neither did they leaue him any one groat of all his poore ſubſtance, as they did let the Prieſt alone with his harlot: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his long impriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, did likewiſe confiſcate that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:17938:84"/>
little that was renaining. Behold, this is the <hi>Spaniſh Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,</hi> which ſo ſtoutly maintaineth the Chriſtian faith, purgeth religion of hereſies, and perſecuteth the teachers thereof.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, there was at <hi>Saint Lucars</hi> a certain ſtranger, howbeit ſuch a one as had remained in Spaine by the ſpace of twentie yeares, who of a very blind ſuperſtition dwelt in a wilderneſſe within a Chappell: where hearing it reported on a time, that a great number of Lutherans were dayly apprehended at <hi>Siuill</hi> by the Inquiſitours, and that they had made an edict, whereby commandement was giuen vnder paine of excommunication, that euerie man ſhould repaire to the holy Houſe with all ſpeede, and declare to the holy Inquiſition whatſoeuer hee knew ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by himſelfe, or by anie other, concerning anie of theſe aforeſaid matters (for the Inquiſitours meant ſpeciall fauour to ſuch, as voluntarily would come in and accuſe themſelues) this doltiſh Hermite came to <hi>Siuill,</hi> went to the holy Houſe, and accuſed himſelfe before the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours. The matter was, for that hee being ſometime at <hi>Geneua,</hi> had heard a certaine Frier diſpute of ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, namely, of Iuſtificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by faith in Chriſt, of purgatory, and ſuch other like, and liked thereof verie well, though afterward ſince that time hee gaue no great heede to them, nor greatly remembred them, and therefore came now to confeſſe his fault, and to craue their pardon. But as ſoon as the Inquiſitors had heard his confeſſion (perhaps to fill vp ſome emptie room in their iayle, or to make vp their tale, wanting an odde man, they ſent the Hermite to priſon, where after he had remained a ſpace, they brought him out vpon the ſtage, and there gaue ſentence vpon him to weare the <hi>Sambenite,</hi> and to ſuffer three moneths impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, and to forfait all his goods. So ſhameleſſe (Loe) are theſe ſhauelings, that they can play ſuch prettie pranks openly, and ſo ſeuerely puniſh theſe trifles euen in their owne darlings.</p>

               <p>Alſo at the ſelfe ſame time, and in the verie ſame Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph there was a certaine poore man brought before the people, who on a time as there chanced a quarrell to ariſe betwixt him and a Prieſt of <hi>Eciia</hi> a citie in <hi>Granata,</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſay of the Prieſt in preſence of other, that hee could not be perſwaded, that euer God would come downe into the hands of that moſt abominable adulterer.

               </p>
               <p>Among the reſt, there were alſo two brought into the ſtage at the ſame time, both young men and ſtudents: The
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:17938:85"/>
one for writing in his tables certaine verſes, the author wherof was vnknowne: which were ſo cunningly contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that they ſeemed to ſound both wayes, eyther to the great praiſe or diſpraiſe of Luther, as it pleaſed the reader to conſtrue them: for the which onely cauſe hee endured a whole yeares impriſonment, and was afterwards brought vpon the ſcaffeld in his hoſe and dublet, bare-headed with a waxe taper in his hand, and baniſhed <hi>Siuill</hi> and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes thereof for 3. yeares ſpace, and abiured <hi>de leui.</hi> The other onely for taking a copy of thoſe verſes, liking them well for the deuice ſake and prettie inuention, had the like iudgement, ſaue only that in ſtead of baniſhment, he paid 100. ducates towards the charges of the holy Houſe.</p>
               <p>With ſuch examples as theſe be, a man might eaſily fill whole volumes, but that I ſuppoſe theſe to bee ſufficient which are already reported, to occupy mens eares withal, that they may vnderſtand &amp; ſee a great ſort of more ſtrange parts than theſe, which the holy Houſe playeth dayly, whereby appeareth moſt manifeſty, by what ſpirit they are guided and gouerned in all their doings, and what their intent is, and how good their title i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>Certaine ſpeciall treatiſes vpon diuers godly Martyrs of Chriſt, who dying very conſtantly like good Chrſtians for the profeſsion of the Goſpel, yet the Inquiſitors notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding deuiſed to defame and ſlander them with <hi>Apoſtacie</hi> and reuolting.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Inquiſitours thinke it not ſufficient to execute ſuch by moſt cruell death, as contemning all their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, remaine firme and conſtant in the profeſſion of the Goſpel of Chriſt, before their faces and in open Court, but ſeek by all meanes poſſible as much as lieth in them, vtterly to extinguiſh in them the life of their ſoules, which is Chriſt leſus dwelling in their hearts by faith, of whom they haue declared themſelues to be faithfull Confeſſours as well at their death as in their life: For when they ſee all their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces void and to haue none effect, becauſe Chriſt taketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mightie protection and ſafegard all his ſeruants, ſo that no man is able to take them out of his hands (as he ſaith himſelfe) then deuiſe they meanes to rob them as much as in them lyeth of their name and renowne of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie, by ſcattering abroad falſe tales and miſreports of them after their deaths, yea ſometimes ere they be dead, as they ſtand vpon the ſtage, clapping their engines vpon their tongues, becauſe they ſhould not contrarie them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting by them, that they haue forſaken their former faith, and returned to the Romiſh religion.</p>
               <p>And this is a double deuice of the diuels owne brain, for two ſpeciall conſiderations, which doe euidently proue that they are aſſiſted by his wicked ſpirit. For hereby they doe not onely rob the Martyrs themſelues of their due de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued praiſe for their conſtancie and perſeuerance: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Church of Chriſt is ſpoiled of thoſe examples, wherin ſhe ſhould otherwiſe reioice, in making her recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

                  <p>IN the firſt ſeſſion holden at <hi>Siuill</hi> againſt the Profeſſours of Chriſtian religion (whom they call Lutherans) there was brought forth in the triumph at the ſame time, one <hi>Iohn Pontio de Leon,</hi> ſonne to <hi>Rhoderico Pontio de Leon</hi> Earle of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> borne of a noble Houſe, and a very good goſpeller, as well for his learning and knowledge, as for the practice thereof, with the continuance of many yeares, as I my ſelfe am able to make report for the great familiaritie and acquaintance that I had with him a long ſeaſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (if need were) could giue a true and a faithfull teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie thereof (before God I ſpeake it) but that all that euer knew him, or that had occaſion to marke his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, will with one conſent (I dare ſay) teſtifie the ſame. Among other vertues that appeared to bee in him vnſainedly and without hypocriſie, he was ſingular in one thing, in that he had an exceeding loue &amp; compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his poor &amp; needy brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: inſomuch that being left very wealthie by his father, able to continue that port that his Anceſtors kept, fell by ſuch meanes almoſt into ſtarke beggery: howbeit ſuch as was to him neither noiſome nor grieuous. Not with ſtanding, diuers haue giuen their blind and fooliſh verdits of him therefore, attributing that to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; prodigalitie, which he did of a rare &amp; ſingular vertue. But ſince he liued ſo well that none could iuſtly ſo much
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:17938:87"/>
as ſuſpect any euill example of life to be in him, and many were in their extremities relieued by his goodneſſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, accepted in ſo good part his poor &amp; hard eſtate, as by all mens iudgements he did very patiently, and in ſuch ſort as a great deale meaner men would ſcarce haue taken a farre better eſtate than hee was in; theſe things muſt needs be euident proofes of a ſingular grace of God to be in him, and ſuch a perfect kind of vertue as was void of all hypocriſie. Yet in recompence of that ſingular pitty &amp; compaſſion which he ſhewed in this world towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he was apprehended by the Inquiſitours for profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Goſpel, and after he had manfully maintained his quarrell againſt their malicious falſhoods during the time of his impriſonment (which was the ſpace of two or three moneths) whether it were the very extremitie of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that enforced him, or their faire and flattering pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſafetie and deliuerance that allured him, but hee ſhrunke at the length and yeelded, where erſt hee was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible, ſtooping and ſubmitting himſelfe to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Romiſh Church. The firſt that euer enticed him ſo ſhamefully to reuolt, was one of theſe ſtinging and venemous flies whom they had caſt into priſon with him in maner as hath beene already declared: who being a man verie well learned, and beſides that a deepe diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, did rather by his cunning enchantments bewitch him, than by any force of reaſons diſſwade or ſeduce him. Howbeit though God ſuffered him ſo to fall for a while, that hee might ſomewhat vnderſtand the frailtie of man, and ſenſibly feele it in himſelfe, yet ſtill remembring his owne word and promiſe, that none ſhall take anie of his flocke from vnder his hands, did not long time thus leaue him to himſelfe, but raiſing him vp againe moſt mightily, reſtored vnto him the double ſtrength that he had before. For the very night immediately before his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution hee did moſt manfully defend the truth againſt his Confeſſor in the hearing of diuers as well priſoners, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:17938:87"/>
the Officers of the holy Houſe: for at ſuch times, their confeſsion is not meer auricular: inſomuch that being demanded by the Prieſt whether he would bee ſhriuen or no, where before the time of his apprehenſion and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment hee vſed commonly to goe to ſhrift, he now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, rebuking the Prieſt for his labour. And being vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with his former doings, anſwered, that hee did it to ſerue the weakneſſe of his brethren, and for feare of offence to them that as yet were not proceeded ſo farre, and yet made his choice of his ghoſtly father; ſo as his ſhrift was more like a godly collation, than a popiſh confeſsion: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry now (ſaith he) as the caſe ſtandeth there needeth no ſuch yeelding. The next day, when ſentence was pronounced vpon him, were openly read theſe articles among others, for the which he was chiefly and principally condemned. Firſt that he ſhould ſay, that hee from the bottome of his heart abhorred the Idolatrie that was committed in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of the bread, &amp; therfore ſo oft as it was his chance to meet it, being caried abroad to ſick perſons, hee eyther turned ſome other by-way, and auoided it, or elſe haſted ſo that he forewent it, becauſe he ſhould otherwiſe haue bin enforced to doe vnto it ſome kinde of worſhip or honour; and at many times chancing to bee in the high Quier, would turne his backe becauſe hee would not behold the eleuation, and for the moſt part vſed to goe to the place where execution was accuſtomably done, (like as was Smithfield here in London) and there would walk a good ſort of turnes, to the end, that by continuall meditation of the martyrdome, but ſpecially of that faithfull and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous confeſsion, which the wicked of this world by force and tyranny cauſed the godly there to make vnto Chriſt (by thus acquainting himſelfe with the place) hee might be the more emboldned, looking one day to be called thither, and ſo ſhould in the meane time prepare himſelfe, patiently to take it when it came. Likewiſe, at ſuch times as by order he ſhould receiue his Maker (as they ſay) he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17938:88"/>
to remoue his houſhold, and to ſend them to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, making them beleeue at their returne that hee had ſo done, becauſe they ſhould not be offended to ſee him take ſuch libertie. But the effect of his confeſſion moreouer was this: that the iuſtification of a Chriſtian man reſteth only in the merirs of Ieſus Chriſt through on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faith in him, and that other purgatory there was none. As for the Popes pardons and indulgences, they were but meer parchment and lead, &amp; he very Antichriſt, &amp;c. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning my ſelfe (ſaith he) I am not only willing, but deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to dye &amp; ready to ſuffer any other puniſhment for this truth which I haue confeſſed, eſteeming of this world <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Howbeit the holy Houſe labored earneſtly by all means, to depraue him, &amp; therwithall, to depriue him of the due co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>IN the congregation at <hi>Siuill,</hi> which the Inquiſitours had wellnigh conſumed by fire, among thoſe that had been a long time profeſſours of the truth, there were foure wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men moſt notable and famous aboue the reſt, for their good &amp; godly conuerſation. That is to ſay: <hi>Iſabella Vaenia, Maria Viroeſia, Cornelia,</hi> and one <hi>Bohorquia</hi> youngeſt of the four: for ſhe was ſcarcely 21. years of age, &amp; yet for vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conuerſation comparable to her other fellowes: but in the knowledge of holy Scriptures, which ſhee had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by continuall reading, and ſtudying, and conference with godly and learned men (whereof there were in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill</hi> a great number at that time) ſhee became ſo ſingular, that ſhee did not onely farre exceede and ſurpaſſe her fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, but many of our Maiſters that are taken for great learned Clerkes, whom in the time of her impriſonment ſhee draue oftentimes to the wall, by their owne confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and made them aſhamed of themſelues. But <hi>Vaenia</hi> the firſt woman was a Matron for maners, and her houſe a Schoole of vertue, and a place of reſort, where the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation aſſembled to ſing Pſalms and hymnes to God both day and night. Nothing was there prophaned, nothing done of hypocriſie and diſsimulation, all was pure &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect religion. At the laſt, the time being come that God had appointed for them, to bee made ready and ripe for him, and ſo to be both apt and able profeſſors of his name and truth, the Inquiſitors ſent for them, &amp; at one draught caught theſe foure with diuers other of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. The firſt thing that occaſioned this <hi>Bohorquia</hi> to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:17938:90"/>
ſuch earneſt ſtudy of the Scriptures, was a little skill which ſhe had in the Latin tongue, wherein it was lawfull to read the Scriptures, both as often, and as long as ſhe liſted; being reſtrained and forbidden, that in no caſe the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould read them in their own tongue. Yea her ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter D. <hi>Giles,</hi> a man whom ſhe did ſpecially chuſe for his ſingular integritie of life, as well as for his excellent lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, was wont to giue this teſtimonie of her, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer came into her companie but he learned ſomewhat, and ſo departed thence alwaies better learned than hee came. During the time of her impriſonment, the Monks and Dominicanes had great diſputations with her, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiling as much at the paſsing excellencie of her wit in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering all their ſubtill and ſophiſticall obiections, and (as it were) cutting them ſo quickly with the ſword of Gods word, as alſo at the wonderfull memorie which ſhee had in citing the holy Scripturs ſo readily: inſomuch that after they had done diſputing &amp; reaſoning with her, they gaue very good teſtimonies of her conſtancy and ſober be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, albeit they termed it by the names of wilfulneſſe and obſtinacie. After they had kept her a long time in that darke dungeon, and there cauſed her to endure all the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and extream torments that might be (by meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they forced her to confeſſe of her owne ſiſter, that ſhee was alſo one of the ſame religion: which was the occaſion firſt of her ſiſters impriſonment, &amp; ſo conſequently of her death, being murthered moſt cruelly among thoſe villains by extreame torments) they brought her forth vpon the ſcaffold, with diuers other godly men &amp; women, wherof I made mention before. How beit ſhe came in ſuch ſort as one making a ſemblance of ioy and mirth and conqueſt ouer the holy Inquiſition, rather then otherwiſe. The which ſtrange countenance of mirth, for ſo much as it was rare to ſee in her, and vnaccuſtomed, vttered by ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pſalms to God, the Inquiſitours of ſpite and malice, ſought to alter into another tune, by ſetting a Barnacle
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:17938:90"/>
on her tongue in the way as ſhe went, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ere they came to the ſcaffold they did vndoo againe. When they had read their ſentence vpon her openly, and giuen iudgement of death, the Inquiſitours asked her whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe would recant yea or no, acknowledging her here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies which heretofore ſhee had moſt willfully maintained. Wherunto ſhe anſwered them roundly, that neither ſhee would, nor truely could confeſſe ſo much. And ſo from thence ſhe paſſed with her other companions to the place of execution accompanied with theſe hypocrites, ſtill cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vpon her and her fellowes by the way to adde the Church of Rome in the article of their creed: but ſhee among the reſt moſt ſtoutly withſtood them.

his neighbours without any regard of his own commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not in reſpect of his parentage, or any curioſity about his body, or otherwiſe in his behauiour or ſpeech. A young man indeede, yet for integrity of life, very notable and famous, Preſident of the Houſe of learning (as they terme it) and choſen therunto by the iudgements of many godly men that were firſt founders thereof, to inſtruct and teach the youth in the Colledge called the Colledge of children. In the which office after he had remained by the ſpace of 8. yeares, to his great commendation, he was perceiued to bee a Lutheran, that is to ſay, a man confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the very paterne of true and perfect piety: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto alſo (as his duty required) he had wrought his ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, as much as lay in him to do in a time of ſo great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution and tyranny. But his reward for his paines, if we reſpect mans recompencing, was much like vnto that which the common ſort of thankleſs people yeeld a man for his good deſerts: but reſpecting faith, ſuch as Chriſt foretold his diſciples that they ſhould find among men. For, being moſt terribly tormented vpon the Ieobit or the Trough, and ſo ſhaken in euery ioynt, that when hee was taken down thence hee was not of ſtrength able to moue any part of his body: notwithſtanding thoſe vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains the tormenters tooke and drew him by the heeles in this plight all along to his priſon, as it had beene a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacke or any carrion. The occaſion why the Inquiſitours dealt ſo extremely with him, was for anſwering them ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what roundly and homely, without relenting or yeelding vnto them one iote. Howbeit, during the time of this ſtrait impriſonment, God vſed him as a meane to comfort and erect a certaine yong man called <hi>Morzilio,</hi> a Monke of the cloyſter of Saint <hi>Iſidore,</hi> laid in for profeſſing the goſpel openly, who by meanes of the Inquiſitours faire and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring promiſes, had a little before relented and yeelded ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in religion.

In the which attempt and enterpriſe, there was a great cauſe of feare, as if hee had vndertaken to bring in cart-loades of Scorpians or other more venemous beaſts, the hypocrites had ſo ſtopped all ventes, and made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint in euerie port, becauſe no maner of light or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſhould by any meanes come vnto them. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, God vnder his mighty protection, and by his owne ſafeconduct, brought that holy burthen thither, and that which was moſt miraculous of all, ſo prouided, that it was both landed and diſcharged within the walls of <hi>Siuill:</hi> where were ſuch buſie ſearchers &amp; catchpols prying in euery corner, that a man might with a great deale more eaſe haue deceiued <hi>Argus</hi> for all his eyes, of the Cow which hee had in charge to keepe.

For at the laſt this matter broke out, and came to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitours knowledge: firſt by meanes of a fooliſh fellow, more fearfull a great deale than need was, and afterwards by an vnfaithfull brother, pretending to profeſſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, wherein he ſeemed to haue profited reaſonably well, but ſhortly after ſhewed himſelfe to be a Iudas, and a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion for the Inquiſition, cloking &amp; colouring his malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſe, with that counterfait pretence of religion, &amp;

The Monkes depart vanquiſhed, they depart vanquiſhed: the Wolues doe flye with ſhame, they flye with ſhame. But long before this time came, hee was much troubled in

the firſt dayes of hearing with the Monkes, and other ſuch maintainers of iniquitie as they are; by whom the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitours, being vtterly vnlearned themſelues, vſe to controle and ouerrule hereticks.

And on the great and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne day of their Doom, being brought out of his priſon into the Court of the Caſtle <hi>Triana,</hi> to be apparelled with ſuch trinkets as are appointed for perſons condemned (like as other of his companions were) the report is, that with a maruellous good courage and countenance hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to exhort them in this wiſe. My brethren be of good cheere, this is the howre wherein we muſt be faithfull wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to God and his truth before men, like as it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the true ſeruants and ſouldiours of Chriſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this little while wee ſhall haue him ready to witneſſe with vs againe, and ſhall within few howres triumph with him in Heauen for euer. But immediately, as hee was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this good and godly exhortation, the villaines ſet a Barnacle on his tongue, and ſo hee went to his execution. How beit ſtanding vpon the ſtep whereon they that are to be executed vſe to ſtand, being not able in words to vtter the courage &amp; conſtancie of his mind in the patient ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of all theſe torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for the Goſpels ſake &amp; the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof, he expreſſed no leſſe in geſtures and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Firſt, kneeling downe, and kiſsing the ſtep whereon hee ſtood: and afterwards being tyed to the ſtake, and couered vp to the head and eares with fagots, did diuers and ſundry times ſhrinke his head into the middeſt of them, as one moſt willing to receiue his death, &amp; deſirous to haſten the ſame: whereby, like a good ſouldiour of Chriſt, hee did very well foreſee and prouide to haue his confeſsion notified, and the infirmitie and weakneſſe of his feeble brethren, if any ſuch there were among them, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and remedied, encouraging them by theſe ſignes and tokens which he gaue them, both ſtedfaſtly to ſtand to the

There was alſo preſent with him at his death one D. <hi>Ferdin ando Rodri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guio,</hi> a falſe Apoſtle, whoſe importunity being not able any thing to remoue him from his profeſſion, cauſed it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the eyes of men, ſo much the more glorious: who ſuppoſing that the terrors of death would ſomewhat haue diſmaied him, obtained leaue of the chiefe officer, that his tongue might be looſed, vpon hope that he would ſgnifie his conuerſion to the common people by word of mouth, Howbeit it fell out quite contrary.

But after he bad been ſchooled there by the ſpace of two or three yeares, and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant among them, hee began to bee wearie of this monkiſh and ſolitarie kinde of life, ſeeking meanes to forſake his order, as hee did indeede: colouring the matter with his continuall diſpoſition to ſickneſſe; and yet being once out, had ſuch a deſire to talke with his former ſchoolmai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, that had inſtructed him in the true and perfect reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that hee returned thither againe, for conference ſake and for their companie. But all in vaine Form the time of his abſence, all they for whoſe reſpect hee entred into that ilfauored order once againe, had left their coules, and were fled into Germanie. Whereupon hee perceiuing that there was no place of aboad for him, determined to alter his purpoſe ſo ſoone as he could certainly learn what was become of his old companions, and whither they were gone. But here perhaps ſome euill diſpoſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons will call him a double <hi>Apoſtata</hi> in forſaking his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der twice.

About the ſame time, by meanes of Queene Maries ſuddaine death, and that the crown of England deſcended vpon the moſt gracious Lady Queen Elizabeth, they of the Engliſh congregation, that by occaſion of the late tyrannie were diſperſed here and there in Germanie, were by Gods good grace called home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaineinto their owne countrey: wherupon diuers Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards that ſoiorned at <hi>Geneua,</hi> thinking England a meeter place for their congregation, did accompanie the Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:17938:94"/>
that returned homewards into England, and for their more ſafety diuided themſelues into ſeuerall companies. For the Inquiſitours tooke the departure of the Monkes in ſo euill part, aſwell in reſpect of forſaking their order, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing their religion, that albeit they were but few in number, yea but a handfull (to ſpeake of) in reſpect of the world, yet they determined to plague them ſoundly, if they could come by them: and thereupon ſent out their flies to lie in wait for them euery where as they ſhould paſſe, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at Colyne, Franckford, Antwerpe, &amp; all the high waies that lay from Geneua that way: &amp; in like caſe all the waies on the other ſide from Geneua to Millayne. The charges whereof were allowed out of the kinges treaſury largely enough, both of the kings owne liberality, and of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire which the Inquiſitours had to catch them. And God knowes much a do there was, ſparing neither for labor nor coſt to finde halfe a dozen dogges to do this feat, and to hunt them out: beſides other great priuiledges and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities that were promiſed to ſuch as would vndertake to bring them againe. A ſtrange thing to conſider, how the Inquiſitours deteſt and abhorre the light of the Goſpell, that they perſecute it to the very death.

And being apprehended, this <hi>Iohn de Leon</hi> took the arreſt with ſo good a courage, that he neuer changed countenance at it, but ſo ſoone as the meſſengers had ſaid that their errant was to him, hee made them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſtraight way. Wel (quoth he) let vs go in Gods name, for hee (no doubt) will be with vs. Whereupon they were both brought back into the towne, and there racked moſt pit fully, to the entent to make them confeſſe of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther companions; and within a few daies after were ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

And in theſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall paines and torments, beſides other ginnes and fetters of iron wherewith they were bound both hand and foot, they were brought into Spaine, and there deliuered into the Inquiſitours priſons: <hi>Iohn de Leon</hi> to the Inquiſitours priſon at <hi>Siuill,</hi> and his fellow to <hi>Valladolit,</hi> where hee was afterwards in defence of Gods quarrell executed by fire quick: as was alſo one Doctour <hi>Cacalia</hi> a companion of his, but a little before him, whoſe brother or ſiſters daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this man had maried. Howbeit <hi>Iohn de Leon</hi> remained a great while in priſon, where he taſted the Inquiſitors ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, ſuffering both hunger and cold, as alſo endured all their torments each after the other: and at the laſt was brought forth in their ſolemne ſhew, arayed in like ſort as the other that had continued &amp; perſeuered as he had done. It was a pitifull thing to behold, and (no doubt) would haue made many a man afraid to ſee ſo griezly a ſight, and ſuch a ghoſt as hee was: his face ſo ouergrowne with haire, his bodie ſo leane as any rake, hauing nothing left to couer his bones ſaue onely the very skin; and to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of his paine, their Barnacle was ſet vpon his tongue, that it was loathſome to ſee the long ſtreames of fleame come out of his ſtomack, &amp; hang roping from his mouth to the ground, as hee ſtood vpright. But when ſentence of death was pronounced vpon him, hauing then his tongue ſet at libertie, to the intent that he might abiure &amp; recant (as they ſuppoſed hee would haue done) hee made ſuch a confeſsion with ſuch a countenance, ſo quietly, without any apparant motion or affection; though in few words, yet ſo effectually, as if he had been in his beſt eſtate and moſt libertie that euer hee was in. At the very laſt

howre of his death, there was aſſigned vnto him a certain Monke to diſpute with him, one of the ſame cloyſter that he himſelfe had once been on, and whoſe nouice hee was the firſt yeare after that hee entred that vnlucky order, that hee might record vnto him the principles of his old poperie and ſuperſtition. Howbeit the more meanes that they vſed to aſſault him withall, the ſtronger he grew and the more able to reſiſt them: for Chriſt (doubtleſſe) like a good captaine defended his ſouldiour. In the end, he was executed as cruelly, as in his life time before hee had beene tormented miſerably, but with as quiet and patient minde as might be.

                  <p>THis man in like caſe was ſcholler to D. <hi>Aegidio,</hi> taught &amp; trained vp by him in the principles of true religion. Among whoſe other good gifts &amp; bleſſings of God, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall hee was indued, this one thing was in him moſt worthy of admiration, that whomſoeuer hee took in hand to teach and inſtruct in vertue and godlines, he did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall kindle as it were a certaine ſeruent zeale in their harts, whereby they were enflamed to all the exerciſes of loue and charity both inwardly and outwardly; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, maruellouſly animated and encouraged to patience at the very houre of their deathes. Whereby hee gaue an euident teſtimony to ſuch as were enlightned with Gods ſpirite, that Chriſt was alwaies preſent with him to make perfect his miniſtery, writing with his holy Spirite in their harts inwardly the ſame in effect that he in words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced outwardly. But beſides the good hap that this man had to light vpon ſo good a ſchoolemaſter, it was alſo his chaunce to meete with no worſe a father in law, a man ſo zealous and well affected in Gods religion, that this <hi>Loſada</hi> being a ſuter to his daughter, although hee were a faire conditioned man, very well learned, and better ſeene in his faculty then a great ſort of practifers bee, yet would hee not graunt vnto him his good will for hauing his daughter to wife, till hee were for a while become ſcholler to Doctor <hi>Aegidio,</hi> and learned of him ſome godly and vertuous inſtructions. A very hard condition ſurely
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:17938:97"/>
for a learned man, and one that thought himſelfe ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently cathechiſed, to ſubmit himſelfe to another mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, but ſpecially to D. <hi>Aegidio,</hi> that was commonly ſuſpected in religion at that time. Howbeit at the length he condeſcended thereunto, whether for vertues ſake, as deſirous of better inſtruction, or for his wiues, I knowe not. But howſoeuer it were, or in what reſpect ſo euer hee did it at the firſt, he applied it ſo earneſtly, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he loſt his maiſter ere he could well haue ſpared him, yet after his maiſters death he declared how much he had profited vnder him: in ſo much that aſwell for his ſingular learning and skill in Scripture, as for his vertuous and godly conuerſation, he was thought the happieſt and worthieſt perſon to bee Superintendent ouer the whole congregation, which was great in number, though here and there diſperſed in corners. As indeede he tooke it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and did very wel diſcharge the office of a preacher among them, ſo far as hee might in ſuch aduerſity. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by meanes of thoſe bookes of <hi>Iuliano paruo,</hi> hee was apprehended by the Inquiſitours (being a thing almoſt impoſſible that ſuch a faithfull paſtour ſhould hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe when his flocke was diſperſed) before whom hee made a plaine proteſtation of his faith, for the which hee endured, firſt, hard and ſharp impriſonment with moſt cruell torments, and the open infamie of their ſolemne ſhew, and laſtly was committed to the fire. Where he, ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding at the ſtake, diſputed very notably of true religion againſt thoſe importunate hypocrites, who vpon a falſe perſwaſion that they had to conuert him, gaue him the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his tongue, to the intent he might haue anſwered their expectation. And whereas they of policy fell out of their Spaniſh into Latine, becauſe the common people ſhould not vnderſtand them, <hi>Loſada</hi> alſo (not greatly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their meaning herein) began to talk in Latin ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly and eloquently, that it was a ſtrange thing to heare a man almoſt dead to this world, to haue his wits ſo freſh

                  <p>
                     <hi>CHriſtophoro Arelliano,</hi> a Monke of the cloyſter of Saint Iſidore in <hi>Siuill,</hi> was by the confeſſion of the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours themſelues ſimply the beſt learned of all that came before them, and was betraied by his owne friends, ſuch I meane, as had receiued a great deale more commoditie and honour by him, then euer they had done by any, yet by their meanes was brought within the Inquiſition. The cauſe why he was ſo highly eſteemed &amp; accompted of for learning, was becauſe of his great reading and ſtudy in the ſchoole-doctours, as they tearme them. That is to ſay, <hi>Aquinas, Scotus, Lombardus,</hi> and ſuch like, that whatſoeuer had eſcaped them in all their workes, making for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the truth, with a very good iudgement and a paſſing memorie, next after the ſcriptures and the ſounder ſort of the fathers and doctours of the Church, hee did both readily vouch, and applied them to his purpoſe very directly, and ſo brought to paſſe, that all his aduerſaries, with whom the authoritie of ſuch trifling writers weigh more then the holy Scriptures of God, were confounded with their owne doctours. Notwithſtanding all this, hee was condemned to the fire. For with theſe maine tyrants fire and fagots is aboue learning and truth, and able to controll &amp; ouerrule them both. But ere he came ſo far, he was firſt brought ſolemnly, &amp; ſet vpon the ſcaffold to haue ſentence pronounced vpon him, where there was a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full matter moſt impudently laied to his charge; That hee ſhould affirm, that the bleſſed and pure virgin Mary, the mother of Chriſt, was no more a maid then hee himſelfe was. A ſeemly ſpeach for theſe good Fathers to publiſh and proclaime in ſuch an open audience, if it had beene ſo that any were ſo beaſtly or ſo wicked to ſay it. Yet ſuch meanes they vſe to bring them into hatred among the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:17938:98"/>
common people, whom they know many men to haue good opinion and eſtimation of for their ſingular and approued vertue. Howbeit when <hi>Arelliano</hi> heard that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blaſphemie, hauing the vſe of his tongue (as GOD would haue it) he cried out in the hearing of all the people, that it was a moſt impudent and ſlanderous lie, ſaying, that as well at this preſent, as alſo at all other times hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hee did euer firmely hold, and beleeue the contrary, being thereunto perſwaded by diuers and ſundry places of Scripture, which hee could preſently alledge if neede were. Alſo for a further vexation, there ſtoode of purpoſe one of the Monkes of the ſame houſe, that had beene his greateſt enemy, laughing and reioycing at his miſery, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it, belike, not ſufficient to cauſe ſo godly a man, ſo excellently well learned, and a very innocent beſides, to be brought into ſo pitifull a caſe, but to amend the matter withall, ſeemed to triumph ouer him in this extremity. The ſuddaine ſight whereof did ſomewhat moue this good man: howbeit like a good chriſtian hee put it vp quietly, and pacified himſelfe, giuing a good example of patience to all that beheld it. Finally, ſtanding at the very ſtake, he comforted and encouraged a certaine monke of the ſame houſe called <hi>Iohn Chryſoſtome,</hi> that ſometime had beene his ſcholler, and now become his fellow, and ſo partaker aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of his death as his doctrine. But foraſmuch as I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know not the very true cauſe why this Monke was executed, I haue therfore not annexed him here vnto the reſt. Yet thus much I can truely ſay of him: A preacher he was, both reaſonably well learned and of good conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and liuing, for any thing that euer was obiected to the contrary. And therefore thoſe hogs that minded nothing but their bellies, did not greatly like of him.</p>

long ſeaſon ſouſed in ſuperſtition and blindneſſe, fanſying it of will, and withſtanding the known truth againſt their owne conſcences (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſin the holy Scriptures call the ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the holy Ghoſt, declaring vnto vs, that the prayers of the congregation ſhall not auaile ſuch perſons as are ſpotted therewith) this prouidence, I ſay, did moſt maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly appear by this one mans example to be of ſuch force, that the deeper that men are drowned in deſperation, the higher it afterwards aduanceth them in honour. This <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> whom they commonly called <hi>Seignior Blanco,</hi> becauſe of his white haires and faire skin, had a very ſharp wit, and for his time was well ſtudied in diuinity: marry, therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſomewhat crafty and ſubtile with a little ſpice of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy: which vices alſo hee did ſo couer with a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait cloke of religion, that he was able to deceiue him that thought himſelfe the wiſeſt man, yea, and did deceiue a great ſort indeed. It hapned in this time that there were two ſorts of Preachers in <hi>Siuill,</hi> and both of them had a great number of auditours diſpoſed to heare each part, as they beſt fancied the one or the other. The one of them concerning doctrin &amp; precepts, came nigher to the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin of <hi>Epictetus</hi> the Stoick, than to the rule of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But herein they were inferiour to <hi>Epictetus,</hi> that all his ſayings and doings were one, but in theſe there was ſome ods: for they neuer ceaſed calling and crying vpon them, to moue them to often faſting, to mortification, to denying of themſelues, to continue in prayer at all times, lowly to thinke of themſelues, which they called humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and to ſhew the ſame as well in apparell, countenance, behauiour and ſpeech, as in all the reſt of their life. But if you had ſtripped theſe fellows out of their ſide coats; Wel, I will not ſay all, but ye ſhould wel haue perceiued them to be men. In ſum, all their religion both top &amp; taile (as they ſay) reſted in works and outward exerciſes of the bodie, quite contrary to the other ſect, and therefore they would ſeem to be doers in any caſe. Wherupon they left the true
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:17938:99"/>
exerciſes of a Chriſtian man, I meane iuſtice, mercy, and faith, the only meanes to attaine true righteouſneſſe, and ranne by heapes to Maſſes, to hallowed places, to ſhrift (as they call it) &amp; many other ſuch like toyes, which the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calleth ſpiders webs that will neuer proue good cloth, hoping by theſe &amp; ſuch like meanes to be purged and clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from their ſinnes. Moreouer they vrged pouerty, with ſole and ſingle life, euen vnto ſuch as were already coupled in matrimony, but eſpecially the vow of obedience, as do the fooliſh friers, to the intent to get them auditours. And this (ſay they) is the true denying of our ſelues, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore extolled it as much as the obedience that is due to God himſelfe. Further, to the entent to keepe them in blindnes and ignorance ſtill, they diſſwaded men from the reading of books written of diuinity; ſpecially from <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> works, by the which they ſhould learne nothing but a little pride in their owne knowledge, referring them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Henricus Herpius, and Bonauentures</hi> works, the <hi>A. B. C.</hi> and the <hi>ſcaling of mount Sion,</hi> and ſuch others, wherein they ſhould learne humility and obedience towards all, but ſpecially towards their elders and ſuperiours. Among others they alſo cited vnto them <hi>Maſius, Cauallius, Guerra, Petrus Cordubenſis,</hi> and many other moe then I can well call to mind: For whom perhaps it had beene farre better neuer to haue beene borne, then to leaue ſuch monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments behind them. Of the which ſort of preachers there were diuers, I confeſſe, in ſome reſpects very honeſt and godly men, but yet none, that vnderſtanding the iuggling and treacheries of their maiſters, would forſake them, and take a better way. For ſundry of them by their vnſeaſonable kind of faſting, and their curious ſearching of high and ſecret myſteries of diuinity, fell into a phrenſie, or elſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in their fooliſh enterpriſe, grew euery day worſe &amp; worſe, that is to ſay, of honeſt men, became very wicked, Phariſes, enemies and crucifiers of Chriſt, and in the ende twiſe ſo euill as were their maiſters whom they followed.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:17938:100"/>
The other ſort did deale more ſincerely with the holy Scriptures, declaring out of them what was true righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and perfect godlineſſe: by meanes whereof they brought to paſſe, that that Citie bare the name aboue all other in Spain for their iuſt and true dealing, by the ſpace of a dozen yeares together, ſo that itappeared that they had fruitfully and effectually heard that peece of Scripture that treateth of true and perfect righteouſneſſe. For here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon came all that plentifull harueſt that hath been inning 8. or 10. yeares, of thoſe good ſeedes of the Goſpel, which then were by them ſo painfully ſowen. The brightneſſe whereof, according to the nature of light, did ſo plainly diſcouer all that counterfait holineſſe, and phariſaicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, that it could not be but that needs there muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue thereafter, firſt hatred and then perſecution. The chief, labourers in this harueſt, were <hi>Conſtantino, Aegidio</hi> and <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quio,</hi> Doctors all, and men both ſober, wiſe, and learned: whoſe trauailes in ſetting forward the Goſpel in ſo great miſts of ignorance, and the worthie ends which they made at their departures out of this life, as they be worthie of eternall memorie, ſo will wee ſhield them that they ſhall not be forgotten. But yet of all the other aduerſaries vnto the truth, this <hi>Arias</hi> was moſt ſpitefull, and more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious than any of the reſt (perhaps becauſe the other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of ſimple ignorance, but he contrary to his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience kicked againſt the knowne truth) for that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been more generally receiued, was more ſightly in ſhew, and more beneficiall to them that followed after it. Howbeit he would not gloze ſo openly as other of the ſame ſort would, for feare of diſcrediting himſelfe with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers men of good reputation, and well affected in religion, with whom he was grown into ſome fauour &amp; good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, by reaſon of that vertuous and godly diſpoſition, which they ſaw in him in apparance: but in ſuch ſort be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himſelfe, and ſo cunningly conueyed his matters, that though ſuch as had tryed him knew what was in him,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:17938:100"/>
yet others tooke him for a deare friend of theirs, and eſteemed of him as if he had bin their kinſman or brother. But as touching his ſubtilties and diſſimulation, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it moſt at one time ſpecially aboue all others, at what time complaint was made to the Inquiſitours by a ſort of hypocrites, perſecutors of the truth, of one <hi>Gregorio Ruizio,</hi> a man (as the report went of him) very well learned, for a certaine thing vttered by him openly in a diuinitie lecture in the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Siuill,</hi> tending towards the controuerſies in religion, and concerning ſpecially a mans iuſtification. For where the Inquiſitors had aſſigned him a day of hearing, two dayes before the day of his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it was his chance to meete with this maiſter <hi>Arias;</hi> with whom hee had ſome a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>quaintance, by reaſon that they profeſſed one kinde of ſtudie, but chiefly for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of vertue that was ſpoken of him, though vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Whereupon, amongſt others that were aſſigned, this <hi>Arias</hi> alſo was charged to be there at that day, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf to diſpute againſt <hi>Ruizio:</hi> who like a crafty A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſo vndermined this <hi>Ruizio,</hi> that he gat out of him all the reaſons and arguments w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he had deuiſed againſt the day of diſputation for the maintenance of his ſide. For <hi>Ruizio</hi> (God knows) taking no great heed therof, nor ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting in him any ſuch trechery, more than he did his ghoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father, communicated the ſame vnto him. Which after <hi>Arias</hi> had obtained, he gaue him a friendly farwell, and ſo left him. At the day of diſputation, when both parts were aſſembled, this <hi>Arias</hi> was alſo preſent, &amp; ioined himſelf to the other ſide that were aduerſaries to <hi>Ruizio.</hi> The which when <hi>Ruizio</hi> beheld, he was ſomewhat aſtonied therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and perceiued at the length his <hi>Legerdemane,</hi> ſeeing him ſo readily out off his arguments, which hee had made him priuie vnto two dayes before, and to anſwer them ſo fully and exactly, that hee had nothing to replie againe: whereupon the ſilly ſoule being thus circumuented, and ſpoiled of all his weapons, yeelded himſelfe,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:17938:101"/>
leauing to <hi>Arias</hi> the honour of the field, which hee moſt like a Iudas had gotten by treaſon and treachery. The like honeſt part alſo for all the world he plaid with D. <hi>Aegidio.</hi> For whereas hee meaning nothing but well (as the moſt conſtant bruit is) had referred the matter concerning the opinion of his knowledge and learning to this mans iudgement, becauſe he knew him to be as able to iudge as a great ſort of others, he gaue ſuch a verdit, as it had been ſomewhat reaſonable for him to haue giuen in a matter of vntruth. Notwithſtanding he was the firſt in all Saint Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors houſe in <hi>Siuill,</hi> that ſtarted out of that dead ſleep of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and ignorance, wherein they were all dead and drowned, and by meanes of a few ſparkes which this man had ſet on fire, a great part of the houſe beganne to ſhake off their drowſineſſe, and to ſee a glimmering of the truth afarre off appeare like the dawning of the day, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that the vaile might bee drawne, to the end that they might the more eaſily ſee the ſhining beames of true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For the whole ſcope of all his ſermons, for the which there was a ſpace appointed, as it fell out moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniently, ſometime by night, from two of the clocke in the morning, till foure, was wholly to ouerthrow all their profeſſion: howbeit not openly, but couertly and as it were afarre off. Firſt, hee taught them that ſinging and ſaying of their prayers all the day and night, was no ſeruice, nor praier vnto God: that the exerciſes of a true Chriſtian man were other then the common people took them to bee: that the holy Scriptures were to bee reade and ſtudied with diligence, whence alone the true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſeruice of God and of his holy will, of true religion, and ſuch as was moſt allowable in his ſight, was to bee had and learned: to the obtaining whereof, we muſt (quoth he) vſe praier as a mean, proceeding as well of the ſenſe and feeling of our owne infirmities and neceſſities, as grounded vpon perfect truſt &amp; confidence in God. Thus, by laying theſe and ſuch like foundations of Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:17938:101"/>
he made them to loath that ſtale ſtuffe of their old &amp; forworn religion, &amp; wrought in them an earneſt deſire of the better, but ſpecially moued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the ſtudy of holy Scriptures. Moreouer, beſides his ſermons hee read dayly a lecture vpon Salomons prouerbs very learnedly, &amp; made application thereof with good iudgement and diſcretion, and had priuate and familiar conference with diuers, ſuch as he was dayly conuerſant withall, and vſed to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, onely to the ſame end and purpoſe. And for this one thing his hap was alwaies very good, to haue ſuch ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers as were tractable and ſoone wrought, and (which was wonderfull to conſider) ſuch as were not greatly wedded to their monkiſh ſuperſtitions though they were vowed: whereby he had leſſe to doe with them, and might with more eaſe giue the aſſault, and in ſhort time batter downe this forced rampire of ſuperſtition, with the perfect ſhot of Gods word. Howbeit his head was ſo full of toyes and new deuices, that after all theſe wholeſome preparatiues, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had ſo wrought in them, that the reſt of their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious dregs might more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly be expelled, &amp; that they were halfe wonne to his doctrine, he made them fall to vnſeaſonable faſtings and watchings before the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whence they ſhould looke for I know not what inſpirations: hee cauſed them to remoue all their ſtuffe, bookes and beds, out of their celles, and to lye vpon the bare earth, or elſe to ſleep ſtanding, to weare a hairecloth in ſtead of their ſhirts, and a hoope of Iron next vnto their skin, with a number of ſuch toyes moe, as though thoſe ſtinking weeds would not haue taken root faſt enough of themſelues, except the earth had firſt been cared vp with the coulter of Gods word, as was before declared. For after hee had weeded the old ſuperſtition, he did nothing elſe but ſow a like ſeede againe, more corrupt and peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than the other that grew before. By meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of manie of his auditours got ſuch good as is like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of ſo dangerous a doctrine. Inſomuch that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:17938:102"/>
of them fell ſtark mad: ſome ſo conſumed with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencholy, that they were halfe frantick: ſome caught vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable diſeaſes and paines in the head, and became almoſt brainleſſe, that they were not able to ſerue any turne thereafter: but they that had ſtronger bodies, and better ſtomackes to beare it out withall, had ſuch a phariſaicall pride and glory in themſelues by meanes of that vaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of holineſſe and perfectneſſe, that no wiſe man will account them in much better caſe than other of their fellowes. And yet perhaps were <hi>Arias</hi> excuſable herein from this ſo grieuous guilt, either for want of better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or by deſtiny if it were ſo, firſt to take vpon him that office, &amp; then ſo meanly to execute it, but that I am right wel aſſured that his conſcience did condemn all the traſh, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he had planted in place of truth. For at the very ſame time being among his companions, would take pleaſure in remembring the folly of ſuch men, that were ſo forward to run any way that he would preſcribe and appoint them. Notwithſtanding ſuch is the force and might of Gods ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that theſe few good ſeedes ſowne among thoſe fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, fructified in the end to the great encreaſe of godlines maruellouſly. Inſomuch, that diuers and ſundry of them, hauing their conſciences cleared &amp; purged of their old hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, and ſcarcely well ſtaied or quieted with theſe new deuices, ſought further by occaſion hereof, for ſome better inſtructions, and vnawares hapned vpon the other ſort of Preachers, that taught the truth with more ſinceritie. Of whom (after they had entred ſome acquaintance with them) they learned the principles of pure and perfect reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, leauing by little and little that euill opinion which they had generally conceiued againſt the Lutherans. Afterwards, being perſwaded that they could by no meanes attaine the perfect knowledge of the truth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they would ſometime peruſe their writings, God did likewiſe maruellouſly prouide for them herein, that they had not onely ſuch bookes brought vnto them by a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:17938:102"/>
miraculous means, as they had a long time deſired, euen at ſuch time as they ſecurely ſlept and ſought for no ſuch things: but alſo all other ſorts of books that were extant at that time, either in <hi>Geneua,</hi> or any part of <hi>Germany:</hi> ſo that hauing ſuch ſtore both of bookes and maiſters to inſtruct them, they began to noſell their whole couent, inſomuch that where at the firſt there were onely two that durſt giue the attempt in ſo dangerous an enterpriſe, there were very few in the whole cloyſter (which at that time was very well furniſhed) but they had ſome taſte of true religion &amp; godlineſſe thereby, and none repined againſt it. Their time that erſt was ſpent in mumbling their mattens and prime, was now beſtowed vpon lectures of diuinity: their dirges eyther cut off altogether, or curtalled very ſhort: their charters of pardons granted by Popes in ancient time whereunto all that crue leaned before, was now accounted for ſtale ſtuffe. As for images, they had a ſmall deale of worſhip done vnto them, or none at all. Vaine faſting was turned into ſeemely ſobrietie: neyther was anie taught to bee monkiſh, but to bee ſincerely and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religious, nor anie mention made of proceeding in their former faſhions, but much talke rather in deriſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to haue them aboliſhed. Neyther did they put this light vnder a buſhell, impriſoning it within their owne walles, but ſent it abroad into the Citie, and the townes and villages adioining, as well by publiſhing of bookes, as by other priuate conference. Then all things being brought to ſo good paſſe, that nothing was left in vſe ſaue onely their ſtout Idoll of their maſſe, and their mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh profeſſion that reſted in their coule and their crowne, which could neyther with good conſcience bee longer ſuffred, nor attempted without preſent perill, and yet no great good like to enſue thereof; they beganne to deuiſe firſt, and afterwards determined with themſelues, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their neaſt, and to flye into <hi>Germaine,</hi> where they might liue with a great deale more ſafetie of

their liues and freedome of their conſciences. A very bold enterpriſe (doubtleſſe) and as ſome thought both raſh and deſperate. For neither was there any great poſſibilitie or likelyhood, that not one or two, but ſo many at once, and ſuch as were not onely the ſoueraignes of the whole houſe and fellowſhip, but famous ouer the whole citie for their excellent learning, ſhould forſake ſuch a cloiſter as the like was not in all the territory of <hi>Granata,</hi> leauing it in a maner deſolate, and eſcape in ſafety from the furtheſt part of Spaine into Germanie. And if they ſhould ſteale a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in ſeuerall companies and at ſundry times, then were they like to be in euill caſe that ſhould tarry hindmoſt. For the Inquiſitors that had been quiet a great while, hauing intelligence hereof by ſome cankred knaue or other, would beſtirre themſelues of all hands. Therefore they concluded briefly, that either all which were priuie to this counſell, muſt depart ſpeedily together, or elſe looke to be apprehended ſhortly after. But God ſeeing them in this diſtreſſe, ſhewed them a meanes, how vnder an honeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence a dozen of them might take occaſion to depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one moneth, and each betake himſelfe a ſeuerall way towards <hi>Geneua,</hi> where they determined to make their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad, &amp; purpoſed to meet all together within one twelue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneth: as for the reſt being as yet but young nonices in religion, which remained behind becauſe they did not greatly like of going away, they within a while after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boad the brunt of the hurly-burly when it came. For at the very ſame time there were three burned out of that cloiſter, and diuers of the reſt diuerſly puniſhed. Inſomuch, that from that day till this, there was neuer any examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of matters touching faith in <hi>Siuill,</hi> but that houſe hath alwaies made out a man, or two. And very likely it is, that the truth ſowen and planted there hath taken ſo deep root, that it ſticketh to the hard ſtone walls, ſo that whileſt any one ſtone ſtandeth vpon another, it will yearely yeeld them one or two Lutherans.</p>

I haue by occaſion entred into this diſcourſe ſomewhat largely, partly in reſpect of Chriſt's Church, towards the which I ſhould ſcarce behaue my ſelfe vprightly, if I ſhould rob theſe men of their renowne due vnto them, in regard of the ouerthrow which they haue giuen to Idolatry and ſuperſtition, behauing themſelues as couragiouſly as they aduentured dangerouſly, preferring vertue and godlineſſe before authoritie and power, voluntarily refuſing their preſent eſtates wherein they liued with ſome worſhip and in much pleaſure, and inſtead thereof contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be poor and diſdained, baniſhed from their owne countrey, to ſuffer ſhame and ignominy: finally, to be eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry howre in danger of their liues, which they led notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in very great miſery. Of the which good and proſperous ſucceſſe, a great part next vnto God wee doe owe vnto this <hi>Arias,</hi> of whom our purpoſe is preſently to entreat, foraſmuch as all this great fire, that hath enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to Gods glory, not onely that houſe, but diuers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the citie abroad, beſides a number of other without the citie which we meane not to touch, bred of thoſe few ſparks which this man kindled at the firſt: who by reaſon of his vnconſtant and fickle nature, being halfe ſuſpected of his friends, and hated of ſtrangers, was diuers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times complained vpon to the Inquiſitors, conuented before them, anſwered the matter, and ſo diſcharged. At the laſt it came to paſle, in that troubleſome time wherein euery man almoſt was apprehended for religion, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> alſo went to the pot with his fellowes indeed, though hee had diuers times ſhifted it off before. The which end was foretold him two or three yeares before by <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and that with a vehement affirmation, on a time when <hi>Conſtantino</hi> bad this <hi>Arias</hi> to his houſe to dinner, where were preſent at the ſame time <hi>Aegidio</hi> and <hi>Varquio,</hi> to the intent to take him vp ſomewhat roundly for his halting, foraſmuch as gentle admonitions vſed before would no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preuaile. But in proceſſe of talke when they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:17938:104"/>
him moſt earneſtly, he ſtart out in a brauery and ſaid, that he feared greatly leſt hee ſhould ſhortly ſee Bulles ſet forth in open ſhew, prophecying ſomewhat plainly of the Inquiſitours Theatre. Whereunto <hi>Conſtantine</hi> made him this anſwer: Behold <hi>Arias,</hi> before God I tell it thee, that thou ſhalt not ſit mounted aloſt, as thou ſuppoſed to ſee and behold othes, but ſhalt ſtand below, and bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thy ſelfe. As indeed it came to paſſe by Gods ſecret and diuine prouidence, that notwithſtanding he had been in time before a faithleſſe fellow, yet his laſt apprehenſion turned not to his vndoing, but wrought in him effectually, and contrary to hope brought forth in him the fruites of of true repentance. For hee did ſo earneſtly and deepely lament and bewaile his former eſtate, that whereas before time, he had been as fearfull as euer was Hare of Hounds, or Ape of whip, now being vpon the racke with a maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conſtancy (which argued in him a wonderfull ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change) hee withſtood the enemies of Gods truth, and took vp the Inquiſitors ſharply, that ſat in their ſeats of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie like Demigods, ſaying that they were meeter to driue packs, &amp; that ſuch an office were more ſit for them, than to ſit where they doe in ſeat of iudgement, and take vpon them the determination of cauſes in religion, wherin they were as blind &amp; yet as bold as Bayard; declaring moreouer vnto them, that for his own part he was heartily ſorry, and did moſt earneſtly repent him, and would doe while he had a day to liue, for that hee had wittingly and willingly in their preſence impugned the truth againſt the godly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of the ſame, whereof hee himſelfe was now become a defender. Many other ſharp rebukes, ſo oft as he came to his anſwer, the Inquiſitours receiued at his hands. But in the end hee was brought forth after their guiſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed maner of pomp, arayed with all their robes, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable (no doubt) in the ſight of God, though in mans iudgement reproachfull and ignominious: a man, to bee reuerenced for hisage, but ſpecially for the hartie repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:17938:104"/>
of his former life, &amp; for that notable confeſſion of the truth which he made, leaning vpon his ſtaffe: &amp; ſo depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from the ſtage to the ſtake with a merry and cheerfull countenance, he made ſatisfaction to the Church of God by this notable example of repentance at his death, for all the miſchiefe that he had done thereto by his vnfaithfull and hypocriticall dealing in the reſt of his life time before. O man moſt happy of all other, worthy to be ſhrined, and to haue a ſeuerall place among the chiefe champions of Gods truth heer in this world, that haſt forſaken the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt miſchiefe and folly, and returned to make the like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of Gods truth that other martyrs and confeſſors haue done before thee: Paul, that choſen and elect veſſell of God, placeth himſelfe among the firſt ſort of ſinners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.</note> he had bin a perſecuter of the Church of God, tho of a good zeale, yet not grounded vpon knowledge. In what place then or degree ſhall we ſet this <hi>Arias</hi> of ours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſinfull ſort, who wittingly and willingly, ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not openly, behaued himſelfe like an enemie, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the ſame? Paul referreth it to the ſecret purpoſe of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that he might obtain the more mercy, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had made himſelfe vnworthy ſo many wayes, ſaying it was to this end, that Chriſt in him might powre out all the aboundance of his mercie and graces, for an example to all them that ſhould truely beleeue in him. How much then and how plentifully hath Chriſt opened his coffers, and beſtowed his mercies (the treaſures of his goodneſſe) vpon this new Paul, if we may ſo tearm him? How ſure and certaine a token doth hee giue hereby, of his excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great mercie, grace, and loue towards all ſinners? Therefore by this one example, this leſſon may we learne, as by the true mirrour of Gods goodneſſe, to keepe our ſelues from raſh iudgements and ſpeeches towards ſuch as wee ſee in the moſt deſperate eſtate that can bee, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as wee cannot certainely tell what God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined concerning them, but ought rather to follow

Afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publike Reader of diuinitie at <hi>Siguenca,</hi> he was ſent for to <hi>Siuill,</hi> by one <hi>Alexander</hi> that was his predeceſſor there, to the intent he might be their Preacher in the Cathedrall Church in <hi>Siuill:</hi> where he was ſo highly commended, both for his vertue and learning, that he was Subdeane of the Church, contrary to their orders, hauing neuer beene examined by the Doctours, as the cuſtome is. And truely for ſuch ſchool-diuinitie, as was generally and vniuerſally receiued all Chriſtendome ouer, he was very famous, and of great credite, marry, hee neuer attempted to preach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, nor had once opened the Bible, to read or ſtudy the Scriptures. And therefore the very firſt time that he came
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:17938:105"/>
into the Pulpit, contrary to all mens expectations, he was found altogether ſo vnfit for ſuch a function, that he began to be greatly out of conceit with himſelfe, and to grow in contempt of others: by the daily encreaſe whereof on both parts, they fell ſo to repent them, the one for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him ſo vnaduiſedly, the other for taking vpon him that office ſo arrogantly, being vnable to diſcharge it, that both they minded to remoue him, and he himſelfe deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to leaue them. But in proceſſe of time, after hee had thus paſſed the pikes by the ſpace of a yeare or two, it was his chance to meet with one that gaue him ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions (or rather it was the ordinance of God, that prouided ſo well, both for him &amp; for the whole citie) that within few howres conference, he learned by that parties meanes the readie way for a Preacher to trauaile in, and what the office and dutie of a Preacher was: to the obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof it was told him, that he muſt vſe other meanes, other bookes, and other maiſters, then hitherto he had done. Whereat D. <hi>Aegidio</hi> was ſomewhat aſtonied at the firſt, hearing him make ſuch a ſermon vnto him, but eſpecially maruelled to ſee his boldneſſe, that being but a plaine fellow, and as a man would ſay a very Ruſſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, beſides that, one taken not to be very wel in his wits, would preſume ſo boldly to teach ſuch a Doctour as hee was, being neither familiarly acquainted with him, nor knowing him to his thinking. Yet D. <hi>Aegidio</hi> being of a gentle diſpoſition by nature, and hearing him diſcourſe ſo largely of the dutie of a Preacher, wherein hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged his owne infirmitie, did the more eaſily bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle himſelfe, and gaue him the hearing quietly. The force of whoſe perſwaſions (being a man indued with Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) was ſo great, that from that day forward D. <hi>Aegidio</hi> was quite altered and become a new man, thinking all his former life and labour euill ſpent, and therefore beganne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new to tread another path which ſhould lead him vnto perfect wiſedome and learning, whereof as then hee knew
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:17938:106"/>
not one ſtep. Furthermore, perceiuing his counſeller to ſtand ſo long vpon that point which concerned the dutie of a good Preacher, he took it to be a ſufficient calling for him to that vocation, whereof he knew he ſhould neither reap commoditie nor eſtimation in this world. Perhaps many will maruell to hear the party named that was the occaſion of ſo ſuddaine a change and alteration of ſuch a man in ſo ſhort ſpace, taking vpon him to teach him the true way to perfect wiſedome. Truly I muſt needs diſcloſe it, to the end that the wonderful myſteries of Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be manifeſted and reuerenced, who by the fooliſh of this world confoundeth the wiſedome of man. His name was <hi>Roderico Valerio,</hi> man long ago condemned at <hi>Siuill</hi> by the Inquiſitors for a falſe Apoſtle, a counterfait Prophet, and a wicked deceiuer of the people, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon baniſhed, and in his exile ſuffred for the profeſſion of the truth. Whoſe wonderfull kind of calling to the true knowledge of Chriſt, ſince I am occaſioned to make mention of the perſon, it ſhall neither be greatly imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent briefly to ſpeak of, nor tedious to ſuch as be godly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. This <hi>Valerio</hi> (a Citizen of <hi>Nebriſſa,</hi> a famous towne as any is in all the precinct of <hi>Granata,</hi> both for the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie thereof, and chiefly for the fame of one <hi>Antonio de Nebriſſa</hi> a notable Clerke as any was, and one that firſt reſtored the puritie of the Latin tongue in Spaine in theſe our dayes) was deſcended of a good houſe, and of ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent abilitie to maintaine the worſhip thereof: howbeit he employed his wealth, not to vertue, but as commonly ſuch men of abilitie doe, which think all their honor to conſiſt in the maintenance of a good ſtable, &amp; the furniture there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in games, in coſtly and exceſſiue apparell, in hunting, &amp; other ſuch like paſtimes and exerciſes. For in all theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities he was ſingular aboue all the yong gentlemen of the whole citie: inſomuch that hee ſought not only to match ſuch as were his equalls in degree and abilitie, but alſo to exceede them far. In the middeſt of theſe vain phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:17938:106"/>
a certaine motion came into his mind (by what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or through whoſe perſwaſion, or otherwiſe by what meanes, God knoweth) but he ſuddenly left all his old de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, contemning the ſpeech of the people (which was a hard thing for a man to doe) and bent himſelfe wholly both body and ſoule to the exerciſe of vertue &amp; godlineſſe, that a man would ſearcely iudge him to bee a man of this world. Moreouer, the wonderfull change that appeared to be in him otherwiſe, as well in his ſpeech and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as in his apparell that was fine and ſutable before, gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious as might be, and now quite altered into ſimple ſtuffe and plaineſt faſhion, was well liked of ſome, but on the other ſide a great number thought it meere madneſſe or ſtarke folly. But as the like falſe verdites giuen of the holy Apoſtles, that were indued with the Holy Ghoſt, were attainted by the effectes of the ſame ſpirit, ſo the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect feare of God, with the bewayling of his former vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the earneſt deſire of righteouſneſſe, and his whole talke tending to theſe ends and concerning theſe matters, alwayes framed according to the preſcript rule of Gods word, was a ſufficient proofe and euidence to men of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecter vnderſtanding, that the ſpirit of God moſt certainly poſſeſſed him. In his youth time hee had gotten a little ſmack in the Latin, by the help where of hee was conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in the holy Scriptures both day and night: ſo that by continuall ſtudie thereof, hee had a great part of them by heart, and could make application thereof to his purpoſe ſenſibly &amp; maruellous readily. He had alſo dayly conflicts with the ſpiritual men (as they call them) the Prieſts and Monks, which were the cauſes (ſaid he) that not only the eſtate of the Clergy, but alſo all Chriſtendome was ſo fouly corrupted, that they were almoſt hopeleſſe of remedy: for which cauſes hee did alſo diuers and ſundry times ſharply rebuke them. Whereat this phariſaicall generation much maruelling, enquired of him how he attained ſo ſuddenly to all this skilin holy Scriptures? how he durſt preſume ſo
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:17938:107"/>
arrogantly to inuay againſt the very ſupporters and lights of the Church? For indeed he ſpared none, but would tell the proudeſt of them his minde, being but a lay-man voide of all good learning, and one that had ſpent the greater part of his time in vaine and vnprofitable ſtudies. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they examined him, by force of what commiſſion hee did it: who ſent him: how hee was called: and by what tokens hee declared the ſame. Alas for them good men, when they cannot denie their abominations, nor longer hold out the light which diſcouereth their darkneſſe, euen now as in all other ages from time to time, they are driuen to theſe ſhifts. Howbeit <hi>Valerio</hi> anſwered them truly and with a bold courage to euery demand: that he had not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for that wiſedome, and caught it in their moſt filthie puddles, and muddie ditches, but had it by the only good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Holy Ghoſt, who poureth whole floods of grace into the hearts of true beleeuers moſt aboundantly. As for his boldneſſe, he told them, that both the goodnes of his quarrell, and hee that ſent him gaue him the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and that the ſpirit of God which is bound to no eſtate or degree, be it in name neuer ſo ſpirituall, ſpecially if it be corrupt, hath heretofore choſen very idiots, and fiſhermen, and placed them in the roome of Apoſtles, to controll the Synagogue of the learned touching the law, to appeach them of ignorance, &amp; to call the whole world to the knowledge of their own ſaluation: &amp; that the ſame Chriſt had ſent him, whoſe name and authoritie hee had for his warrant: but as for any ſigne to declare the ſame, he ſaid it was the token of a baſtardly generation, and of the branches degenerate from the true ſtocke of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, to aske for any ſignes in the time of ſuch light, when all things ſhine therewith, yea verie darkneſſe it ſelfe as cleare as noone day. At the length, for theſe, and ſuch like matters he was called to his anſwer before the Inquiſitors, where he diſputed very earneſtly of the true Church of Chriſt, and which were the markes to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:17938:107"/>
know it by, how man was iuſtified in the ſight of God, and of ſuch other points of religion: the knowledge whereof, he confeſſed that he had attained vnto by no meanes or help of man, but by the onely handy worke of God, and his wonderfull reuelation. Howbeit his madneſſe &amp; phrenſie, wherewith the Inquiſitors ſuppoſed him to bee troubled, excuſed him for this time: yet to the end that he might the ſooner come to himſelf again, they condemned him in the loſſe of all his ſubſtance, &amp; ſent him packing as poor as Iob: but he neuer repented himſelfe thereof, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came other man; inſomuch that within a yeare or 2. after he was ſent for againe about the ſame matters, &amp; then dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to make recantation: marry, in conſideration that they tooke him to be lunatick ſtill, they ſpared him his life, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudging him neuertheleſſe to weare the <hi>Sambenite,</hi> and to ſuffer perpetuall impriſonment during life, ſaue onely that on ſundayes they brought him forth, with many other moe of his companions, and carried them to Saint Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours Church to heare ſeruice. Whereas diuers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times he aroſe out of his place, and in the hearing of all the people, controlled the Preacher when hee taught them amiſſe. At what time it ſo chanced, that the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were not halfe ſo bad as other that had beene before them, ſo that his fact was wound vp quietly, and excuſed by madneſſe and folly. Afterwards, he was remoued forth of priſon to Saint <hi>Lucars,</hi> into a certaine houſe of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, where he died, being a man aboue 50. yeares of age, a very wonder to the world at that time, ſent to awake men out of their dead ſleep of wickedneſſe &amp; ignorance wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they lay ſnoring and ſnorting ſo long. But foraſmuch as thoſe articles whereof he was moſt vniuſtly condemned, were ſtrange and not heard of in <hi>Siuill</hi> at thoſe dayes, hee had a <hi>Sambenite</hi> appointed to weare, ſuch one as was of the largeſt ſize that any ware in his time, the which at this day is to be ſeen for a ſpeciall monument of a notable heretike in the veſtry of the chief Church in <hi>Siuill,</hi> in a place
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:17938:108"/>
where euery man may eaſily ſee it, with this inſcription wrought in capitall letters, <hi>Roderico Valerio</hi> a citizen of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briſſa,</hi> an <hi>Apostata,</hi> and a falſe Apoſtle of <hi>Siuill,</hi> who ſaid he was ſent from God. By this mans aduertiſement, as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, was this Doctour <hi>Aegidio</hi> firſt awaked, and by his inſtructions came firſt to the knowledge of the true Goſpel of Chriſt, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> lay buried a long ſeaſon before, ſo that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maiſter nor ſcholler once heard ſo much as one word thereof. Therefore ſo oft as his matter came in hearing before the Inquiſitours, this Doctor <hi>Aegidio</hi> did alwayes ſtand his good friend as much as in him lay, through whoſe meanes it was thought that he found the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at the Inquiſitours hands in the mitigation of their ſentence vpon him, being a relapſe as their term is. But in the end Doctor <hi>Aegidio</hi> himſelfe bought full dearely that little curteſie that was ſhewed to this man at his mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For thereby he purchaſed to himſelfe both much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and grew dayly into great ſuſpicion with all that pack of Phariſies, that could not wel away with his perfect and vertuous ſinceritie. Beſides theſe good inſtructions, this <hi>Aegidio</hi> was alſo familiarly acquainted &amp; conuerſant with <hi>Conſtantino Fontio,</hi> a man excellently well learned, by whoſe dayly conference, he profited maruellouſly in ſtudie, fell to the reading of good Authors, and ſo grew to profound knowledge in the holy Scriptures: but ſpecially concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſuch matters whereof he would preach to edifie the people withall, he both learned them perfectly by confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with otherwiſe &amp; learned men, &amp; partly by his own reading and experience: at the length, beganne to preach as learnedly, godly, and zealouſly, as he had before times done coldly, fooliſhly, and vnskilfully. Then began the hearers to feel the maruellous force of that doctrine which theſe three men of great credit and eſtimation, <hi>Aegidio, Conſtantino,</hi> &amp; <hi>Varquia magno</hi> taught with one conſent, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the more they grew in knowledge from their old ignorance and blindneſſe, the more were theſe men
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:17938:108"/>
had in reputation among them, and the old hyporcites de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, that had taught them other doctrine to the great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of their ſoules. Whereupon there were dayly diuers complaints brought to the Inquiſitors eares of theſe men: but ſpecially of D. <hi>Aegidio,</hi> who of meer ſimplicity, and by reaſon that he was in ſome more authoritie than the reſt, did more openly inueigh againſt the aduerſaries of the truth whom they began chiefly to enuie at ſuch time as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror in reſpect of his ſingular learning and integritie of life, elected him to the biſhopricke of <hi>Dortois.</hi> For then thoſe hypocrits began to beſtirre them of all hands, and to lay all their heads together to giue him a lift, thinking that if he were once conſecrated Biſhop there, he would keepe a foule coyle in their kingdome. Therfore they cited him to come before the holy Houſe, where plaint was entred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him by ſuch as were their crafts-maiſters, able to worke him miſchiefe, and to bring it about cloſely, ſo that by their meanes he was caſt into priſon, and therupon exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. The firſt matter was concerning the iuſtification of a Chriſtian man, and diuers other that depend thereon; as of mans merits, of purgatory, of the meanes of ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for ſinnes deuiſed by mans braine, of the number of Mediatours, and whether there were any moe than Chriſt alone: alſo concerning the aſſurance of faith in ſuch as are iuſtified, &amp;c. Beſides theſe, there were alſo other matters that fell out by occaſion of an abominable Idoll of the bleſſed Virgine Marie, wrought very artificially by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando</hi> the King (as the report goeth): the which Image, vpon diuers feaſtes of the bleſſed Virgine, is ſet vp and ſhewed to the people with great pompe: whereupon Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie or the worſhipping of Images came in queſtion. Alſo by like occaſion of a certaine chip of wood that is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuperſtitiouſly honoured in the ſame Church, as a peece of the Croſſe whereon Chriſt was crucified, the which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Doctour <hi>Aegidio</hi> wiſhed to bee burned, the ſame matter likewiſe came in talke. Moreouer, concerning
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:17938:109"/>
inuocation and prayers to dead ſaints, and the baniſhing out of pulpits the deuices of mans brain, and of placing therein the perfect and expreſſe word of God and other ſuch neceſſary matters of like importance: and therwithal, to ſet him forward, he was charged to be an earneſt fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of <hi>Valerio de Nebriſſa, &amp;c.</hi> Whereunto D. <hi>Aegidio</hi> made anſwer particularly, but chiefly touching the firſt poynt. whereof he made ſo perfect &amp; abſolute a defence, ſo learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo godly, &amp; ſo abſolutely, as any hath bin hitherto heard or ſeene: in the which anſwere hee gaue his aduerſaries twenty waies to take aduantage of him, and thereupon to inferre diuers other ſuch hereſies. But at that time the Inquiſitours were not growne ſo bold as ſince then they haue beene, nor indeede durſt burne ſuch a man as he was for theſe quarrels, albeit they were vrged and called vpon on euery ſide very earneſtly ſo to do. Therefore ſeeing that they could in no wiſe make him change or alter his minde, they began to deuiſe which way they might ſaue his life, becauſe the Emperour, who lately had elected him to ſo great a Biſhopricke, as alſo the whole Chapter of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrall Church in <hi>Siuill,</hi> were becom very earneſt ſuters in his behalfe. There was alſo one of the Inquiſitours named <hi>Corrano,</hi> a good and a fatherly old man, who for that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which hee had by his owne knowledge of the good conuerſation of Doctor <hi>Aegidio,</hi> and of the froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his accuſers, ſtood his very good friend, though his wicked aſſociate <hi>Pedro Diazio</hi> was ſore againſt him; who like a proud <hi>Apoſtata</hi> forſooke the truth, wherein the ſame <hi>Valerio de Nebriſſa</hi> had inſtructed him in his priuate lectures vpon Pauls Epiſtle to the Romanes: for the which hee gaue him at that time moſt hearty thankes, and yet notwithſtanding was now become a turne-cote. When <hi>Varquio</hi> was dead, and <hi>Conſtantino</hi> in the low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries with the Emperour being his chaplaine and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour, there were certaine arbitratours appointed on both partes concerning this religion that was newly come
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:17938:109"/>
into Spaine. And Doctor <hi>Aegidio</hi> for his part among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers named one <hi>Bartholomeo de Zamora,</hi> a Monke of the order of Saint Dominicke, a man very well learned, and one that knewe the truth. Who afterwards by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours meanes was preferred to the Archbiſhopricke of <hi>Toledo:</hi> whence hee was ſhortly after depoſed for religion, or as it is more probably coniectured, vpon ſome priuy grudge which the Archbiſhop of <hi>Siuill,</hi> high commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner in the Inquiſition, bare vnto him, and ſo after many conflicts with the Inquiſitours, at the length died. But at that time hee could not bee preſent at this triall, by reaſon that hee was attendant vpon the Emperour: So that <hi>Arias,</hi> who was commonly called <hi>Seigneur Blanco,</hi> was Iudge at that time. But what his verdite was, is already partly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in the ſpeciall hiſtory that I haue written of him, and perhaps the ſame may come forth to light hereafter particularly ioyned with the anſwer that Doctor <hi>Aegidio</hi> made thereunto. But whether <hi>Arias</hi> were thereto nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the Inquiſitours themſelues, or by Doctor <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidio,</hi> as yet it is not certainly known: ſo that ſome being abſent, and ſome fearefull to ſpeake their mindes for feare of afterclaps, the determination thereof was refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to one called <hi>Dominico à Soto,</hi> a ſophiſter of great ſame in the Vniuerſity of <hi>Salamancke,</hi> and one other of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Saint Dominicke, who after great expectation of his comming, at the laſt came from <hi>Salamanck</hi> to <hi>Siuill,</hi> and there entred diſputation with Doctor <hi>Aegidio</hi> that was but a plaine-dealing man and of a ſmall foreſight, more craftily and ſubtilly then other had dealt before him. Firſt, pretending much good will towards him, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceauing that by dealing with him openly, hee could in no caſe remoue him from his opinion, hee fained himſelfe to be iumpe with him in the ſame: marry hee aduiſed him, that foraſmuch as thoſe articles that preſently were called in queſtion were ſomewhat odious in moſt mens eares, to the end to ſtoppe that gappe, hee would make and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:17938:110"/>
publiſh ſome apt declaration and expoſition thereof, the which he offred to preſcribe vnto him in the beſt ſort that he could, that he might vſe it if it liked him, or elſe they two to conferre about it, and ſet it forth to the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their conſciences, furtherance of the truth, and contentation of the hearers. Whereupon <hi>Aſoto</hi> preſcribed ſuch a preſident: both of them conferred about it, and in the end agreed without any controuerſie. There was a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne day of hearing appointed by the Inquiſitours for that purpoſe, and two pulpits ſet in the Cathedrall Church, the one for D. <hi>Aegidio,</hi> the other for <hi>Aſoto,</hi> and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were aſſembled thither. <hi>Aſoto</hi> began his ſermon, and proceeded accordingly. Immediately after the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he drew forth of his boſome a declaration quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that whereupon they were agreed. For in the former there was nothing but that which was conſonant to the truth and his own conſcience: in this, no ſuch matter, but only a plain recantation of all thoſe things whereof he was accuſed, and had bin a maintainer of before by the ſpace of 2. whole yeares, and lately alſo during the time of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment. But the pulpits were ſuch a diſtance aſunder, that by meanes thereof partly, and partly with the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure of the common people, whiles euery man gaue his verdite thereof, there was ſuch a noiſe, that Doct. <hi>Aegidio</hi> could not well vnderſtand what <hi>Aſoto</hi> ſaid: but yet for the good opinion which he had of him, gaue him ſuch cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, that at the end of euery article, when <hi>Aſoto</hi> craftily asked his conſent thereto, willing him to ſpeake aloud that the people might hear him, or elſe to ſignifie ſo much by ſome countenance or geſture, he did ſo, confeſſing that he did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to all thoſe things which <hi>Aſoto</hi> had read vnto them. Whereupon he was preſently condemned to ſuffer impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment for 3. yeares. Moreouer, this crafty Monk procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a prohibition againſt him for preaching, reading or writing by the ſpace of 10 yeares after, enioining him du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time, not to depart Spain. Wherat D. <hi>Aegidio</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled

much, hearing that his puniſhment was no greater, knowing nothing hereof, nor vnderſtanding after what ſort he was circumuented, til the time that he was brought to priſon againe: whither diuers of his friends reſorting to viſit him, began to rebuke him for denying the truth. The which things wee neuer came to haue any notice of, but of his owne mouth in the time of his impriſonment. During w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> time he chanced to hear of the death of 3. of his moſt deadly enemies, <hi>Sbarroia,</hi> a ſophiſter &amp; one of <hi>y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

Neither is it to be otherwiſe thought then to be the ſecret iudgement of God, that 3. of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemies that the truth had, and ſore aduerſaries to this innocent man, ſhould dye all within one yeare each after other, while D. <hi>Aegidio</hi> was in priſon, and his matters in examination, and (as it is reported) that ſome of them ſhould depart ſcarce quietly. Howbeit hee liued foure or fiue yeares after that retractation which was compaſſed of him by ſuch deceitful meanes, and was neuertheleſſe eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of all that godly congregation, and did as much good to other afterwards, as at any other time being at his moſt liberty. In the w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> time, by reaſon of an embaſſie which he was ſent in, he viſited his brethren that ſometime had been ſchollers to D. <hi>Cacalia</hi> at <hi>Valladolit</hi> profeſſing the goſpel vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, &amp; renouncing all wickednes &amp; impietie. Whom after he had comforted and confirmed, in his way home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as he returned to <hi>Siuill,</hi> being ſore ſhaken in that long iourney, by reaſon that he had not been acquainted with trauaile of a great while before, he ſickned, and thereupon within a few dayes after departed this troubleſome life, and went to euerlaſting reſt.</p>
                  <p>He left behind him certaine Commentaries vpon the book of GENESIS, &amp; Saint PAULES Epiſtle to the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:17938:111"/>
Coloſſians, vpon certaine of the Pſalmes and <hi>Canti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca Canticorum,</hi> written by him in the Spaniſh tongue very learnedly, and like one plentifully indued with the Holy Ghoſt, the which are reſerued in the cuſtodie of diuers men of truſt and credit, as iewells and treaſures to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe of the Church. The which albeit they were both learned and godly, yet other things which hee wrote in priſon, doe ſo farre exceede them for the ſpeciall affections moued (no doubt) by the ſpirit of God, and expreſſed therein, that a man may eaſily ſee the force of affliction &amp; tribulation, how much it auaileth the godly for deepe iudgement in matters of diuinitie. But within two or three yeares after his death the new Inquiſitors thinking that the other who had the examination of him had dealt a great deal more eaſily with him than became Inquiſitors, ſeeing that they could not cite his ſpirit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therfore, foraſmuch as the worthines of this man was ſo great, I am iuſtly occaſioned ſomewhat largely to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:17938:111"/>
diſcourſe of him in this hiſtorie. Wherein I feare it great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leſt I ſhall not bee able ſufficiently to ſet out the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of that man accordingly as his worthineſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth. For how can I deuiſe to ſound thy prayſes ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, being the moſt famous Diuine of any that hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in our dayes, and one whom God of his aboundant gracious goodneſſe, did indue ſo plentifully with ſo rare qualities, as hardly are to bee ſeen together againe in one man, ſo that well they may be wondered at, but neuer va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued to their worth? It is a ſtrange matter, and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, and yet true that I will report of him, for I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to iuſtifie it: that of many thouſands of men that haue viewed this mans qualities thorowly, there was neuer any, but eyther loued him paſſingly, or elſe hated him ſpitefully. Therefore as he was ordained to be both beloued and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with extremitie: ſo had hee many malicious enemies, and as many earneſt friends and fauourers. And heere I comprehend not vnder the name of friends, ſuch as hee himſelfe bare good will vnto, more than I account thoſe men among the number of his foes to whom hee wiſhed euill: but onely ſuch as he knew not, and yet they with all their hearts both loued and honoured him. For thoſe that he bare ſpeciall affection vnto (foraſmuch as he knew the vnconſtancie of this world) were onely one or two in all his lifetime. Notwithſtanding, ſuch as he thought worthy to be beloued in reſpect of their vertue, he would pleaſure any way that poſſibly he could. His youth, in compariſon of other young men that beſtudious, perhaps he beſtowed not ſo prayſably: yet ſo, as it was no hindrance to him in his age afterwards, but that he paſſed it with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. For being a man of a maruellous pleaſant wit, and in matters of diſport pleaſantly diſpoſed (otherwiſe very faire conditioned) hee diminiſhed his credit and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ſomewhat after he was grown in yeares, by vſing himſelfe ouermuch to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſting. Howbeit, that was only with his aduerſaries, who notwithſtanding would as greatly
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:17938:112"/>
haue diſliked him on the other ſide, if hee had been as ſage and graue as either <hi>Curius</hi> or <hi>Cato.</hi> And indeed there are a great ſort of his ſayings in many mens mouthes, which being well weighed and conſidered, are more worthy to be called wiſe Apothegmes, than pleaſant ſpeeches: but they are ſuch as cannot aptly bee expreſſed, and retaine their grace in any other language. Neither did he ſo commonly vſe to ieſtat any, or ſo finely, as at thoſe hypocrites the Monks and Prieſts that had a certaine pride in themſelues, of a fooliſh phariſaicall opinion of holineſſe, being but in meere toyes and trifles. But moſt of all he vſed to gird the fooliſh Preachers, whereof there was neuer any age ſo full, whom the holy Scriptures account to be the vileſt ſort of people that are, comparing them to ſalt that hath loſt his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor, &amp; wil ſerue to no vſe. Neither can any man ſufficiently maruell at his paſſing wit, that being in a barbarous age, when all good learning was almoſt loſt, and forgotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, in this vniuerſall time of ignorance, hee did either only attaine to grounded knowledge, or had very few fellowes. And in the tongues, to wit, the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, became ſo notable without any teacher, that he alone had been ſufficiently able to reſtore them vnto vs of himſelfe. As for all other kinde of learning that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to the furniſhing of a perfect oratour, he attained not onely a ſuperficiall ſight therein, but a perfect and abſolute knowledge. With theſe helpes he fell to the ſtudy of holy Scriptures, wherein he became ſo well learned euen in his youth, that whenſoeuer he was occaſioned to ſhew his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion concerning any matters, or the ſignification of any termes therein, he left nothing vntouched that any might doubt of, except ſuch as were blind as buzzards, &amp; could ſee nothing. Moreouer, he was ſo eloquent in his owne tongue, that all his auditors were brought into a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration thereof. Being thus furniſhed with theſe good gifts, he fell to preaching, and without compariſon paſſed all them of this age or of the age before him. Beſides theſe
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:17938:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
good qualities, hee had a ſingular good diſcretion and iudgement in all his doings, the which he had attained vnto, partly by great ſtudy, partly by long practice and experience, but ſpecially by great ſearch and profound knowledge in holy Scriptures, wherein he plainly ſaw, as it had beene from the top of a high Tower, whatſoever all the world did. At ſuch times as he preached (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly was about eight of the clock) there was ſo great reſort to his Sermon, that after foure of the clocke in the morning, and many times from three, it was hard to get a good place in all the Church where a man might conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently heare him. Notwithſtanding all this fauour and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which all the people bare vnto him (except the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious hypocrites) beſides his meat and drinke for his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſuſtenance, and his Library which was but meanly furniſhed, he gathered together no other great ſubſtance: for he was a man farre from thoſe two plagues that haue alwaies infected the Church of Chriſt, couetouſneſſe and ambition. In ſo much that being offered a good Canon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Church of <hi>Toledo,</hi> which many a man of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would think himſelfe in happy caſe if he might attaine vnto, he was ſo farre from the greedy deſire thereof, that he contemned it, rather not caring for it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

But he made them anſwer without any great deliberation, that he had great cauſe to yeeld them many thankes for their good opinions conceaved of him, in that they thought him worthy of ſo great a dignitie, ſaying that hee would doe the beſt he could to requite their curteſies. Howbeit foraſmuch as his fathers and his grandfathers bones buried many yeares agoe, were now in reſt and quiet, he would in no caſe doe any thing whereby the reſt that they were in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:17938:113" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might be interrupted. And this (I ſuppoſe) was the ſumme of his anſwer and the very words which hee ſpake.

The Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop was hated of the chief men of the chapiter becauſe he had openly &amp; in opprobrious maner reported them to be deſcended of the loine of the Iewes: and they on the other ſide being men in good eſtate, and not able to beare theſe reproaches, thought to be euen with this fooliſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop that came from cart &amp; plough, and by good hap (as a man may ſay) without all reſpect of learning or honeſty, was preferred to the higheſt dignity in all Spain next vnder the king: and becauſe he was a troubler of common quiet, they purpoſed to work him all the ſpight that might be: by meanes wherof none were ſpared that had been buried by the ſpace of a 100 yeares, but that this good Archbiſhop vnder pretence of religion made inquiry of the Canons fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, grandfathers and great grandfathers, driuing them to deriue their pedigree out of their graues.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, being the firſt man that brought the knowledge of true religion into <hi>Siuill,</hi> he did ſo plainly ſet it forth and ſo ſincerely, ſo ſharply rebuked thoſe pedlers that ſold all their packs of pardons and other fancies for pence, laying ſuch things ſo ſore to their charge, that notwithſtanding they ſaw full well that he would proue a plague both to them and their whole generation, yet could they not finde any iuſt cauſe to accuſe him of but to their owne ſhame, and yet ceaſed they not to hate him deadly. Howbeit he took away their ſtings ſo cleane, that they could neuer come conueniently to poiſon him: neither did hee ſlacke for all
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:17938:113"/>
that to ſet forth the truth, notwithſtanding that hee knew they lay in wait for him priuily. And ſurely it was the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular prouidence of God which ſo bleſſed that Citie, that there ſhould be in that Church at once three ſuch notable men and ſo excellently learned, <hi>Conſtantino, Aegidio</hi> &amp; <hi>Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quio,</hi> which before times were Students together in Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and now furtherers of vertue and good religion with one conſent, and with like zeale. For <hi>Varquio</hi> did read vpon the Goſpell after Matthew, in the Cathedrall Church; and that being done, did afterwards take in hand to expound the Pſalter. <hi>Aegidio</hi> preached dayly: <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> not ſo often as <hi>Aegidio,</hi> but to as great fruit and edifying, continuing all together each man in his roome, till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that God ſent ſtormie tempeſtes, to the end to try each mans building, that <hi>Varquio</hi> in the middeſt of this hurly burly, while hee and his aduerſaries were bickering together, died: <hi>Conſtantino</hi> was ſent for by the Emperour and his ſonne Philip, and forced to forſake <hi>Siuill.</hi> So that Doct. <hi>Aegidio</hi> was left alone like a lambe among a ſort of wolues to miniſter matter for a tragedy: the which is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy declared in this hiſtorie. After whoſe death <hi>Conſtantino</hi> left the Emperours Court, where hee had gotten both wiſedome and learning, and returned to <hi>Siuil</hi> againe to ſet forward the light of the Goſpell that had beene ſtopped for a while. The which thing he did with as much zeale as euer he did before time: ſo that both he himſelfe was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well eſteemed, and his ſermons liked of all the people exceedingly. It was alſo his chance, by reaſon of a certaine order taken by the whole Chapiter, to bee appointed the next lent after his comming to preach euery other day in the Cathedrall Church. The w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> when he refuſed to take vpon him becauſe of his late ſicknes, being ſcarcely well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, he was compelled to do it perforce, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was ſo weak a creature that he was ſomtime car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thither, &amp; for faintnes once or twiſe in a ſermon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to drink a draught of wine to refreſh himſelf withal,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:17938:114"/>
and to make him able to hold out til the end of his howre. The which (doubtleſſe) was a very ſtrange ſight to behold: and yet ſuch fauour euery man bare towards him, that hee was diſpenſed withall to vſe that libertie. Afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſtored to his health, he deuiſed a ready way to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his purpoſe, and ſuch as none had troden in before him. For by his meanes one <hi>Seignior Scobario</hi> a famous man in <hi>Siuill,</hi> both in life and learning, to whom the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of the Citie by common conſent had committed the charge and ouerſight of the Colledge of children (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the houſe of learning) conferring with <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantino</hi> about the matter, tranſlated the reuenue that ſome drunken chaplen would haue deuoutly drunk for his ſoule, into a yearely ſtipend, towards the maintenance of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie-lecture in the ſame Colledge, whereof this <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantino</hi> was choſen reader. Who both happily tooke in hand and effectually purſued that profitable exerciſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning firſt with Salomons Prouerbs, the booke of the Preacher, and <hi>Cantica Canticorum.</hi> Which after hee had paſſed through very learnedly, he proceeded into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ob, and expounded it more than halfe. All which workes are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant at this day in written hand, gathered very painefully by one of his auditors named <hi>Bab.</hi> Wherein it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare hereafter, as I can haue leaſure to publiſh them, how farre hee hath exceeded all that haue written vpon theſe books hitherto, and how excellently wel learned he was. But ſome euill ſpirit enuying the good ſucceſſe of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, vnder the pretence of feruent zeale, cauſed him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake that courſe wherein hee ranne before, and afterward incombered him ſo many wayes, that he was neuer cleare quit of all till his dying day. About what time welneare, it hapned that the chiefe Canonſhip (which was firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a Preacher) fell void in the Church of <hi>Siuill,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Doct. <hi>Aegidio</hi> his death. Whereunto the whole Chapiter would willingly haue choſen <hi>Conſtantino,</hi> as one whom they thought of deſert worthy the place, for the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17938:114"/>
notable gifts that both they and all the whole Citle ſaw in him of a long time while he continued Preacher there, but that it would not ſtand with the rules of their Houſe to admit him therunto without oppoſitions. For vpon their laſt error in chuſing Doct. <hi>Aegidio,</hi> immediately after, they entered an order, that none thenceforth ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to enioy that place without their accuſtomed kinde of oppoſitions vſuall in all Churches. Whereas <hi>Conſtantino</hi> on the other ſide had alwaies ſcorned and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rided thoſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, as toyes, not much vnlike the contentions of iugglers &amp; minſtrels for the beſt games. Moreouer, one <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſio</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Siuill</hi> &amp; a courtier, owing <hi>Conſtantino</hi> a priuy grudge from the firſt time that he preached before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, &amp; grew into his fauour, was very earneſtly in hand with the Chapiter, preſſing them with their own decree, after he vnderſtood that they were about to vndo it again. Wherupon there was a day appointed for the oppoſition, and publiſhed in the moſt famous Cities in Spaine, ſo that diuers came flocking, as it had bin a ſort of crowes about a carrion. But the wiſer ſort kept themſelues away from encountring with him, for the greatfauour and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that hee was in, ſo that there were but onely two that aboad the brunt: the one called <hi>Maiuelo</hi> a Canon of <hi>Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> the other a Canon of <hi>Malaga,</hi> hoping belike to get ſome great bootie thereby. Howbeit the firſt vpon better aduiſement returned home againe ſhortly after to <hi>Alcala:</hi> the other Canon of <hi>Malaga,</hi> bolſtered by the Archbiſhop to ſpight <hi>Conſtantino</hi> withall, wilfully continued the skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh. At the length, <hi>Conſtantino</hi> being ouercome through the great entreatie and perſwaſion of the Chapiter, but eſpecially moued by the importunate ſute of a friend of his, to whom I wiſh he had not yeelded ſo much in this (for then perhaps he had been aliue at this time) reſolued himſelfe to ſtand for the Canonſhip, and to diſpute after the accuſtomed order: by meanes whereof fulfilling that ceremony, he of <hi>Malaga</hi> was ſent to ſhake his eares, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:17938:115"/>
the Chapiter preuailed againſt the Biſhop. There was alſo at the ſame time a little zeale which blinded <hi>Conſtantino,</hi> leſt perhaps ſome prater ſhould haue ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ept in place, that would alwaies be barking againſt good &amp; godly doctrine: whereas by his accepting of the ſame place there was a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain likelyhood and hope, that the doctrine therby ſhould haue the more free paſſage. In reſpect whereof, hee was the more willing, rather then for any greedy or couetous deſire of attaining any wealth thereby, the which vice hee alwayes contemned with a manly courage. Whereupon, his aduerſarie that ſtood againſt him perceiuing himſelfe vnable to weigh with him, either for learning; counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or fauour which hee found at the Chapiters hand, bent himſelf wholly to take exceptions to his perſon, &amp; to diſable him that way. Firſt he began to obiect againſt him all his youthly toyes, namely mariage, the w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was before he entred into orders, charing him that neither hee was rightly prieſted, nor came by his degree of Doctorſhip or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly. On the other ſide, a maruellous rabble of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites that had been of his old acquaintance began to bee galled afreſh, ſeeing him ſo highly preferred, inſomuch that they fell to reuiue old matters concerning diuers points of religion, vrging them more earneſtly than they had done before time, &amp; that in the court of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Inquiſition, wherein <hi>Valdeſio</hi> his aduerſary ſat as Iudge. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the middeſt of theſe broiles, <hi>Conſtantino</hi> reſting vpon the good wils of the Chapiter, was inſtalled, and whiles the controuerſies were at the hotteſt, there was much buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in that Church by meanes of certaine books of <hi>Iulia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no paruo,</hi> whereof I made mention before. In the which ſtormes what place was there wherein <hi>Conſtantino</hi> might ſhroud his head? And yet being brought before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitours, albeit hee had thorowly diſpleaſed all his aduerſaries in the former braules before, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he auoided all their quarrels picked againſt him by his quicke and ready anſwers (after his accuſtomed maner)
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:17938:115"/>
ſo eaſily, that they could in no caſe get him to make any open proteſtation of his faith, by the which their hope was to compaſſe and circumuent him. And in very deede he had eſcaped at the length, but that God of his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prouidence compelled him ſore againſt his will, brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainely to confeſſe his truth. For nigh about the ſame time there was a very honeſt and a ſubſtantiall wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, named <hi>Iſabella Martina,</hi> apprehended, in whoſe houſe <hi>Conſtantino</hi> had hidde certaine ſpeciall bookes for feare of the Inquiſitours, which hee might not auow the keeping of in Spaine without preſent perill. Whoſe goods being ſequeſtred according to the cuſtome of the Inquiſition, her ſonne, one <hi>Franciſco Bertramo,</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueighed diuers Cheſts of the beſt ſtuffe that his mother had, becauſe hee would ſaue ſomewhat, ſo that theſe gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die gulles ſhould not deuoure all. The which thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Inquiſitours eares, by meanes of his vntruſtie ſeruant who diſcloſed it, was the occaſion that they ſent immediately one <hi>Ludouico Sotellio</hi> their <hi>Alguazill</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thoſe Cheſtes. Who reſorted vnto him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; as he began to ſay his meſſage ſoberly, <hi>Bertramo</hi> forgetting the Cheſtes, and ſuppoſing that the cauſe of his comming had been for <hi>Conſtantino's</hi> bookes, tooke the tale out of his mouth and ſaid vnto him: <hi>Seignior Ludouico,</hi> I know whereabout you come, and therefore if you will promiſe mee on your honeſtly quietly to depart vpon the receite therof, I will ſhew you them. The <hi>Alguazill</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Cheſtes (as for the bookes hee neither came for them, nor knew of any ſuch before) promiſed him ſo to doe. Wherupon <hi>Bertramo</hi> carried him forth with into a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret place far within the houſe, and plucking forth a ſtone or two in the wall, ſhewed him <hi>Conſtantino's</hi> iewells of paper indeede, but farre more precious than gold or pearle. Whereat the <hi>Alguazil</hi> being ſomewhat aſtonied, to find that which he looked not for, told him that he came to demand no ſuch maner of thing, but certaine Cheſtes of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:17938:116"/>
his mothers goods, which he had purloined from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter. As for his promiſe made vnto him for his quiet departure, he ſaid hee was not bound thereby otherwiſe, but that he muſt needs carry both him &amp; his books to the Inquiſitours. Thus by theſe meanes came all <hi>Conſtantino's</hi> writings out of corners to light, and to the Inquiſitours hands, contrary both to his owne expectation and his aduerſaries, which would haue giuen a great peece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to haue come by them before. And among other of his writings there was one great volume found written throughout with his owne hand, wherein (as the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours themſelues reported in their ſentence which they gaue vpon him afterwards ſtanding vpon the ſcaffold) hee did openly and plainly in maner, as it were for his owne ſatisfaction, handle theſe ſpeciall points: that is to ſay, the ſtate of the Church, the true Church &amp; the Popes Church, whom he called very Antichriſt: the Sacrament of the Lords ſupper: the inuention of the Maſſe, wherein hee ſaid that the whole world was deceiued &amp; abuſed through ignorance of the holy Scriptures: the iuſtification of a Chriſtian man: Purgatory, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he termed the wolus head, ſaying that it was a deuice of the Monks to feed their own bellies: alſo Bulles &amp; Popiſh pardons, mens merits, ſhrift, and other articles of Chriſtian religion. The which book ſo ſoone as it came to the Inquiſitors hands, they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him if he knew his owne hand: howbeit he ſhifted them off from their purpoſe a good while, and droue them off from day to day, til at the laſt vnderſtanding the will of God, who had now taken away all euaſions from him, he acknowledged his owne hand, and confeſſed it to bee his owne writing, proteſting openly, that all things therein contayned were full of truth &amp; ſinceritie. Therefore (ſaid he) take ye no further paines in ſeeking witneſſes to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie againſt mee, ſince you haue ſo plaine and perfect a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of my opinion and beliefe, but doe deale with mee as it ſhall pleaſe you. After the which examination and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:17938:116"/>
hee remained in priſon by the ſpace of two whole yeares: where partly by occaſion of his corrupt &amp; naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie diet, though he were not a man greatly curious or dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie therein before time, but chiefly, of very ſorrow conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him to ſee ſo much labour, both of his owne and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers his fellowes, ſpent in vaine vpon that good Church, which now was ſo miſerably ſacked, he fell firſt to be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle craſed, and afterwards being not able to abide the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding heate of the Sunne, which made his priſon like a hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe vnto him, was faine to ſtrip himſelfe into his bare ſhirt, &amp; ſo to continue both day &amp; night. By occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he fell ſick of the bloody <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lixe, and within 15. daies after dyed, amids the filth &amp; ſoile of the priſon, rendring vp his ſweet ſoule to Chriſt, for the promoting of whoſe glorie he had oftentimes before aduentured it moſt manfully. And in this time of his ſicknes, as well as at the howre of his death, there was preſent with him a certaine young man, a Monk of Saint Iſidors cloiſter, vertuous and well diſpoſed, who alſo was priſoner there for religion at the ſame time, and put in the ſame priſon with him to keepe him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. This Monkes name was <hi>Ferdinando.</hi> Perhaps in the eyes of fooliſh worldlings this <hi>Constantino</hi> ſeemed to dye, but in very deed he reſteth in peace. As for the cruell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which other haue accuſtomably beene tormented withall, the truth is, he neuer taſted any, not for any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that theſe cruell Termagants had of ſuch a man as hee was (whoſe diſpleaſure hee had earneſtly procured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him by his ſharpe and quicke anſwers while hee was priſoner) but eyther, for that they determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay his puniſhment, meaning to detaine him, in priſon a longer ſpace, to the intent to diſcourage him, and to keepe other that fauoured his doctrine anie way, or were entred in that religion, in continuall awe: or elſe, becauſe they thought not that hee ſhould haue been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken forth of their hands ſo ſuddenly. Whereupon, the Inquiſitours bruted a rumour abroad to the ſame end
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17938:117"/>
and purpoſe, to daunt ſuch as had been his ſchollers, that they might come trembling into the Court, and accuſe themſelues before they were ſent for, vpon hope of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitours mercy: cauſing it to bee noiſed, that he in his life being vpon the rack, had confeſſed vnto them of diuers that were his auditours &amp; ſchollers. To the which end and purpoſe, diuers of the next priſon adioining to his, were ſuborned to affirme that they heard the cries and ſhrikes which he made at the time of his tormenting. Therefore now after his death, ſeeing him to bee taken out of their hands by Gods good meanes, ſo that now they had him no more aliue among them to extend their crueltie vpon, they determined notwithſtanding to worke him ſuch poore ſpight as they could, in derogating from the good eſtimation and report which he had of all men, ſpreading falſe and ſlanderous tales vpon him, that hee ſhould ſtrike himſelfe in a veine with a peece of a broken glaſſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o auoid both ſhame and paine. There were alſo ſung openly in the ſtreetes ouer all the Citie diuers filthie and ſlanderous dities ſung by boyes in his diſpraiſe: but whether they were publiſhed by procurement of the Inquiſitours, or ſome of their Paraſites, or of meer malice deuiſed and ſet out by the fooliſh and variable people, God knoweth, but the other is the more likely. Alſo againſt the day of their ſolemne Triumph, his corps was taken out of the graue, &amp; in place thereof, a puppet of ſtraw put, and afterwards ſet vp in a pulpit ſo artificially, reſting the one hand vpon the pulpit, and holding the other vpright, that it reſembled <hi>Conſtantino</hi> very liuely, in ſuch ſort as he was wont to preach. And no doubt but that dumbe Image did preach as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in many mens hearts at that inſtant as euer he himſelf had done being aliue, in deriſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of whom this puppit was made. Then, at what time that ſentence was to be giuen vpon him (to the hearing whereof, diuers came from pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces farre diſtant from <hi>Siuill)</hi> the Inquiſitours commanded that it ſhould not be pronounced out of the pulpit where
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:17938:117"/>
other iudgements were accuſtomably read, but cauſed the Image to be brought into their holy Court, and there to haue ſentence publiſhed: which place was ſo high, that the the people could not well vnderſtand what was read. Whereupon <hi>Calderonio</hi> the temporall Iudge thinking it not conuenient, and that ſome other ſubtiltie was meant thereby, moued the Inquiſitours in open audience, that iudgement might bee giuen in the accuſtomed place, or elſe read in ſuch ſort that the people might vnderſtand vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what occaſions they had condemned him. Whereunto when the Inquiſitors gaue no great eare, but proceeded as before, there began to be a great tumultamong the people, foraſmuch as they could not well brook that iniurie, nor indeede would haue put it vp as it ſeemed, but that they ſaw <hi>Calderonio</hi> ſomewhat more quicke with the Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and to tell them their duties once againe: ſo that they commanded the Image to be carried into the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med place, and ſentence to be pronounced aloud, to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the people withall. The reading whereof, occupied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout an howre and an halfe: and the chiefe matter contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned therein, was that which I haue receited before out of <hi>Conſtantino's</hi> booke. Marry, the Inquiſitours added more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that of purpoſe and vpon good conſideration they had omitted many things that were ſo horrible, ſo wicked, and ſo ſtrange, that it was ſore againſt God commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to vtter them in common audience. There bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of this mans works extant that haue paſſed the print. Firſt a briefe ſumme of Chriſtian religion. Alſo one other diſcourſe in the ſame argument more at large, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what imperfect, or rather ſcarcely halfe finiſhed: for he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to haue comprehended the whole bodie of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion, in two tomes. In the former hee treated of faith: In the other hee thought to haue handled the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to haue ſpoken of workes, and generally of the duetie of a Chriſtian man. As for the former part, it was already publiſhed ſome yeares agone: whereby hee
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:17938:118"/>
procured to himſelfe ſome diſpleaſure and ſuſpicion of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie among the common ſort of learned men, foraſmuch as entreating of faith he did not plainly inueigh againſt the Lutherans, nor attributed any preeminence to the Biſh. of Rome, but had written rather in derogation of pardons, of purgatory, of mens merits, and ſuch other like trifles, then in aduancement thereof: vpon the which ſuſpicions being examined, he would anſwer them, that ſuch matters as they wanted in his workes were more pertinent to his ſecond tome, wherein he purpoſed to diſcourſe of them ſomewhat largely. Howbeit this other volume neuer came to light, except perhaps it were that which was hidden in the widows houſe, and came to the Inquiſitors hands, the ſpeciall points whereof they publiſhed, as I haue before declared. Moreouer, he ſet forth a Catechiſme, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in other places elſewhere of more freedome and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie was not greatly accounted of, but yet in theſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of darkneſſe and ignorance, and vnder ſuch tyranny, it gaue much light to many. There be alſo extant ſixe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of this good mans, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he made vpon ſix of the firſt verſes of the firſt Pſalme. Wherein the learned may ſee, as well the profound learning that was in him, as alſo his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular art for conueiance. But of all his workes, which ſurely were as learnedly written and as godly as anie that euer were read in Spaine, the confeſſion of a ſinner, not paſſing two or three ſheetes long, exceeded all the reſt, both for the zeale, learning, and eloquence vttered therin, moſt liuely expreſſing the affections of a Chriſtian man, incident to ſuch an argument. Firſt he bringeth in a man before the iudgement ſeat of God, making him to ſee, and liuely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:17938:118"/>
and therewithall maketh ſo plaine and abſolute an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the whole law, in that ſhort ſummarie, that in ſuch a breuiat (be it ſpoken without offence to any) I haue not hitherto ſeene any ſo lightſome. In the end hee clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theth them with the wedding garment of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe by faith, wherewith alonely he encourageth and emboldneth man before the face of God, as much as hee diſcomforted him before when as he brought him to the perfect knowledge of himſelfe, &amp; the conſideration of his owne caſe and eſtate. Finally, there is no one lot that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth chriſtian religion, but he hath touched it, referring it to ſome purpoſe in that briefe table: nor any affection that can be in a man, from the very firſt letter of the law til the laſt end of the Goſpel, and the fruition of the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly habitation, but he hath moſt liuely expreſſed it. Neither had he been euer able to deuiſe ſuch a peece of worke, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his paſſing gifts of nature and helps of art, except he had firſt learned them by often experience in himſelf. All the which books of his writing, worthie (no doubt) to be reſerued for euer, albeit the Inquiſitours had a little before vnawares allowed, yet at this time they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned them: not for any thing found in them worthy of condemnation (as they themſelues teſtified in their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence vpon him) but becauſe there ſhould be nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant that might remaine as a monument or a memoriall ſounding any wayes to the commendation of him whom they had holden accurſed. Laſtly, they ſhewed their poore ſpight vpon that good mans dry bones, which they digged out of the earth, &amp; vpon that counterfait Image made to his likenes. Howbeit hee himſelfe being exalted aboue the clouds, &amp; taken out of their chains, &amp; deliuered from their vniuſt iudgements (beſides the loſs of theſe notable &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy monuments mentioned before) hath cauſed a great number of his familiar friends and acquaintance comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
