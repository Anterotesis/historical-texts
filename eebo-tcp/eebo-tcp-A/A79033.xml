            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head type="sub">A Proclamation prohibiting the payment and receipt of Cuſtomes, and other Maritime Duties upon the late pretended ORDINANCE of both Houſes of PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE have made ſo many Declarations of Our Royall Intentions concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of the Religion and Lawes of this Land, That Wee thinke it not fit oft to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate, Though by Gods grace We ſeriouſly intend never to decline or depart from the ſame. But this ſeemes moſt ſtrange unto Vs, that whil'ſt (eſpecially at, and about LONDON) Our juſt and Legall Commands are not obeyed, other Orders and Ordinances, (for which there is no Legall foundation) which not onely diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance but overthrow the Lawes of the Land that ſettle Religion, and were the ſences of the Subjects property, are ſubmitted unto and obeyed by many of Our wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker Subjects: And amongſt theſe a blind obedience hath been yeelded unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Ordinance, for ſetling Cuſtomes without an act; of Parliament, when an Act this Parliament (received from Vs, and ſo underſtood by Vs, as one of the greateſt graces the Crowne ever conferred on the Subject) declares, no Cuſtome is due without an Act; and all ſuch perſones as receive the ſame incurr the forfeiture of a premunire. This We thought would not have found obedince from the Merchant, who underſtood what his owne benefit was thereby and could not be ignorant how penall it was in him to breake this Law; eſpecially when he found he paid his Cuſtome for ſupport of an unnaturall Warr againſt his Prince, and to foment an inteſtine and Civill diſſention which hath already, and may in the future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſo many Evills upon this poore People. But upon the menaces and uſage ſome received that denyed it, We find ſince a more generall Obedience in ſuch as Trade, then We expected, though We underſtand by it the Trade of the Kingdom is much leſſened. Nevertheleſſe We thought not fit untill this preſent, by any of Our Proclamations to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite the ſame, becauſe We hoped before this time; We having ſo often and by ſo many meanes endeavoured the ſame, ſome happy underſtanding might have beene between Vs, and both our Houſes of Parliament. But at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent finding that the monyes ariſing from theſe Duties, are a great part of the fewell that maintaines this fire, and ſupports this unnaturall Rebellion againſt Vs, and heightens the Spirits of ſuch as have no Spirit to Peace, unleſſe they may deſtroy Vs Our Poſterity, and the ſetled government both of Church aod State; We doe hereby Declare to all Our People of what ſort ſoever, That whoſoever henceforward ſhall, by vertue of the pretended Ordinance of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, pay any Monyes for Cuſtome or other Dutyes therein mentioned, other then to Our proper Miniſters, what is due to Us by the knowne Laws of the Kingdome, That We will proceed againſt him or them in due time, as an ill-affected perſon or perſons to the Peace of this Kingdome, and as ſuch as endeavour (as much as in them lyes) to hinder a true Intelligence betwixt Vs and Our People. And for ſuch perſon or perſons as ſhall continue to require or receive the ſame contrary to the Statute made this Parliament, We ſhall likewiſe proceed againſt them according to the penalty in the ſaid Act, And becauſe (though the Law ought to have been every mans prohibition) We did not, untill this time, forbid the ſame, We doe hereby grant our free pardon to all ſuch as formerly having either paid, or received theſe cuſtomes, ſhall henceforth refuſe the ſame, And to no other.</p>
