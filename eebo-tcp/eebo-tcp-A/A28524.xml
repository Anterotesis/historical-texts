         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Men there were of his own Country, that
highly prized and Eſteemed his writings
though <hi>others</hi> Judged and found fault with
them; to whom the Authour in his <hi>Anſwers</hi>
hath clcerly made it appeare, they have <hi>NOT
underſtood</hi> his Meaning, but injuriouſly made
their own miſtaken Sence, the Ground of their
Cenſure; it is no wonder therefore, that among
us of <hi>another</hi> Language, who have but a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherein much of the accurateneſ<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> and apt
expreſſion of an Author is <hi>loſt,</hi> that men here alſo
finde ſuch fault <hi>with them</hi> as they doe; but if
it be examined, their <hi>want</hi> of the true appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of them, will be known to have cauſed
that negligent and heedleſs Opinion, that his
writings are <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>underſtood,</hi> yet it hath
proceeded ſo farre, that thoſe, who think they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
his <hi>Deepe</hi> Matter are ſuſpected by ſome
Academick wits, to be but <hi>miſs-led</hi> into ſuch a
conceit: But thoſe Eminent perſons his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Men,
and <hi>adverſaries</hi> have not once charged
him with writing things not Intelligible, though
indeed themſelves have not rightly perceived the
Authors <hi>meaning,</hi> as is apparent in theſe
<hi>FOUR</hi> Bookes of <hi>Apologie</hi> or Defence in
anſwer to the few objections to ſome things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57399:3"/>
in that Doctrine, ſet down at Large in
the Treatiſes of his <hi>Sublime</hi> Myſteries, if they
be read and weighed in the Balance of Due Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p>The <hi>FIRST Apologie</hi> was an <hi>Anſwer</hi>
to <hi>Balthaſar Tylcken,</hi> who wrote a treatiſe againſt
ſeverall <hi>Clauſes</hi> in the <hi>Aurora,</hi> concerning the
knowledge of God in and by <hi>Nature,</hi> whereas,
though God in himſelf be totally Incomprehenſible
and unmanifeſted in his <hi>Abyſſe;</hi> yet Nature is
his Manifeſtation or <hi>Revelation;</hi> for if his
Omnipotent power did not ſhew it ſelf by making
it ſelf <hi>diſcernable,</hi> it would never be known, but
remaine hidden Eternally, and indeed all the
<hi>effects</hi> which we perceive to be wrought and produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
at anytime in ſenſible things, are brought to
paſſe, by the ſame <hi>Powers,</hi> that have and doe
and will work from Eternity to Eternity <hi>percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
in <hi>GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that is in <hi>GOD</hi> is only <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> his
very wrath is his Fire, and the cauſe of his Light
and Glory in himſelf, and therein is <hi>moſt</hi> juſt
and <hi>Good,</hi> alſo for the puniſhment of the perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Creatures, whom he made like himſelf
<hi>very Good,</hi> and gave them power to Continue ſo;
but they being Creatures were made out of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and being Created and brought into the
Light, <hi>could</hi> and <hi>did</hi> love themſelves, and all
Creatures <hi>without the Light</hi> or that looſe the
Light, are but Darkneſs, and by that meanes Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted
their Darkneſs above the Light in them,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57399:3"/>
which is truly Selfe-Love, and the roote or ſpring
of all Evill, which God <hi>cannot DOE,</hi> nor <hi>BE,</hi> but
that we might be able to get out of the <hi>perdition</hi>
we are fallen into, God in his infinite Love and
Mercy, to all men in and from <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi>
(they <hi>two</hi> being <hi>one</hi> Fleſh,) hath given, in the
<hi>Light</hi> of their <hi>Life,</hi> the Spirit of Adoption, the
Spirit of Chriſt his Sonne, the Seede of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
the Promiſed word, the word of Faith in
our Hearts; which in <hi>US</hi> hath Power to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
all the works of Darkneſs, and to bring us
to his <hi>marvelous</hi> Light, the Light of Eternall
Life; which alſo teacheth us to <hi>deny</hi> our ſelves,
and <hi>all ungodly Luſts of the Fleſh,</hi> to take up our
Croſſe with Patience and ſo follow or imitate
Chriſt, in <hi>Newneſs of Life,</hi> and inward hearty
Holineſs of Converſation; God indeed <hi>Cannot</hi>
deny himſelf, becauſe his Darkneſs that is his
wrath is alwayes, ſubſervient to his Light and
Love which Eternally is his Life, and cannot be
otherwiſe: but <hi>WE muſt</hi> Deny our ſelves, and
then our Darkneſs will give it ſelf up into the
Light, alſo, in <hi>us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we follow or be like, his Light, we are
<hi>Children</hi> of the Light which ruleth in us, and
if we live according to his Darkneſs we are <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
of Wrath, and at length if we convert not
ſhall be confirmed <hi>Children</hi> of Perdition; <hi>All</hi> that
have the diſpoſitions or <hi>qualities</hi> inwardly or
Outwardly, of Love and Gentleneſs, Kindneſs, low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
or humility, ſincerity, Truth, righteouſneſs,
vertue, honeſty, chaſtity, temperance, purity and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57399:4"/>
Holineſs, are undeniably <hi>GOOD:</hi> On the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the wrathfull, fierce, Envious, proud, ſurly,
churliſh, wanton, vaine, ſtubborne, obſtinate,
crafty, falſe Lyars, injurious, intemperate, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
are accounted bad or <hi>EVILL,</hi> and they are
ſo indeed; now that which is Evill cannot be
<hi>like</hi> Gods Love, but here is the generall miſtake,
<hi>all</hi> Men conſiſt both of an Outward and Inward
Man; that which the outward, Eſteemes Good,
is ſo as it is a <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of that which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
Good, but ſince the outward Man which
is framed of the Earth, hath gotten the <hi>Predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minancy</hi>
in the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> who thereupon
dyed to the Inward Man, that which <hi>moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth</hi>
the outward, doth make it the more ſtrong
and <hi>rebellious</hi> againſt the power of the Inward,
and ſo by <hi>outward</hi> Good things, not knowing
how to uſe them, by little and little, <hi>deſtroyeth</hi>
the Inward, and therefore God in his Bowells of
Compaſſion, ſends us that which is <hi>fitteſt</hi> for us, to
the weakening or dayly <hi>Killing</hi> and ſlaying of our
Outward Man, by tribulations afflictions Croſſes
and Contradictions or oppoſitions, from others,
for the making us <hi>Conformable</hi> to the Image of
<hi>CHRIST,</hi> who was Tempted, perſecuted, and
afflicted, and as the Apoſtle ſays, he that will live
Godly in this world, <hi>muſt</hi> ſuffer Perſecution; this
meaſure our <hi>Authour</hi> had from ſome, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
by their Objections, and ſtriving to bring
his <hi>marvelous</hi> Gifts into diſlike with thoſe that
knew not but the Cenſures caſt upon him were
<hi>right,</hi> thereupon, for the vindication of the Truth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57399:4"/>
and for the ſakes of thoſe that were but <hi>beginners</hi>
in the ways of Chriſt, he then anſwered to the
things that were laid to his charge, with ſuch
<hi>evidence</hi> that even his adverſaries may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
and reconciled to acknowledg the <hi>ſame</hi>
truth with him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>SECOND Apologie</hi> was in anſwer
alſo to a Booke of <hi>Balthazar Tylckens,</hi> againſt
<hi>Jacob Behme's</hi> hints of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in ſome of his treatiſes written <hi>before</hi> the
yeare 1621. whereby the greate Controverſies
between the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> about
the will of God, and of Man, are <hi>kindly</hi> Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled,
but he <hi>not</hi> apprehending the Ground and
depths in them, which reſolve thoſe Queſtions,
did very much <hi>oppoſe</hi> this Author, alſo the
<hi>Tutour</hi> to his children whoſe name was <hi>Dr.
Charles Weiſner,</hi> did take greate diſtaſt at him
likewiſe, as may be ſeen by a Letter at the End
of the Epiſtles, herewith printed, but by perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Converſe with <hi>J. B.</hi> he received ſuch <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>
and Content, that he asketh God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs,
for his <hi>former</hi> hard Opinion of the
Author: But <hi>Balthazar Tylcken,</hi> wrote alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Booke of the <hi>Incarnation</hi> and Perſon
of <hi>CHRIST</hi> and of the <hi>Virgin MARY,</hi> to all
which, the Author hath anſwered particularly
in <hi>this</hi> Apologie.</p>
            <p>The Next Treatiſe is concerning the <hi>Four
Complexions,</hi> Compiled at the Deſire of ſome
friends upon the neceſſary Occaſion of a Perſon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57399:5"/>
that was very much tempted afflicted and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Satan,</hi> and therein he hath very exactly
deciphered the Nature of the <hi>Cholerick, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine,
Phlegmatick,</hi> and <hi>Melancholy,</hi> complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
with their Effects upon the Soule that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habits

alſo the <hi>Cures</hi> and <hi>Remedies</hi> to make
them advantagious to the Soules progreſs in the
way to Eternity, while it is in <hi>this</hi> Life: that,
never any treatiſe was written before ſo fully
briefely and yet convincingly, as far as hath
been Commonly knòwn either among the bookes
of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> or <hi>Divinity:</hi> it was formerly
tranſlated into Engliſh by a worthy Perſon, in
very <hi>Elegant</hi> language, which notwithſtanding
was thought to be the writing of another au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
by thoſe that delighted to reade him,
not having the ſame <hi>Phraſe</hi> with his other
Bookes, for which cauſe I was induced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſlate
it, though not in ſo good a ſtile, into
that kinde of Expreſſion which makes it known
to be one of his workes.</p>
            <p>The following Piece, was his <hi>Conſiderations</hi>
upon a Booke ſet forth by <hi>Eſaias Stiefel,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Threefold State of Man, and of the
Newbirth, of the River flowing out of <hi>Sion,</hi>
and the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> wherein are handled
diſtinctly that Threefold State and Condition
of Man; alſo of the <hi>Reſurrection at the Laſt
Day,</hi> what that <hi>Body</hi> is, <hi>IN</hi> this Corruptible
Body, which ſhall riſe againe and put on Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57399:5"/>
and <hi>in what Manner,</hi> with more plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as I conceive then in his other Bookes.</p>
            <p>After that, is here placed, his <hi>THIRD
Apologie,</hi> in Anſwer to a Booke of the ſame
<hi>Eſaias Stiefel,</hi> concerning <hi>Perfection:</hi> ſhewing
what the Inward and Outward Perfection is,
which is <hi>attainable</hi> in this Life, and which
way we are to demeane our ſelves, for the avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Errours incident thereto, and for the
eſtabliſhing and Conſirming the <hi>Truth:</hi> Great
Perfection was attained by ſome mentioned in the
Holy <hi>Scriptures;</hi> as <hi>Enoch,</hi> in his walking with
God, and his Tranſlation; <hi>Moſes,</hi> when his Face
ſhone like the Sun, when he deſecended from ſeeing
but the glory that was left after God was paſſed
by the Clift of the Rock, whereinto God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
had put him, leaſt he ſhould be conſumed
before that Glory of Gods Face; <hi>Eliah</hi> in his
Miraculous Life and taking up alive in a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
of Fire into Heaven; <hi>Chriſts</hi> Transfiguration
when his Face alſo ſhone like the Sun and his
Garments were Bright like lightening, in the
preſence, of <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> in Mount
<hi>Tabor,</hi> before his Death; <hi>Stevens</hi> Face ſhining
as an Angell when they Stoned him that he dyed;
and all the Prophets and Holy Men in their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
Converſation upon Earth; All theſe
attained High Perfection in this Life, our
<hi>not ſuch</hi> as when Mortality ſhall be ſwallowd
up of Life: yet the leaſt among the children of
God <hi>are of a perfect Heart.</hi> Other many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
enquiries are unfolded in this Treatiſe,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57399:6"/>
about the purity and impurity of the Holy
<hi>Matrimonial Propagation,</hi> as when <hi>Moſes</hi> ſayd to
the outwardly Holy Miraculous people, after they
were brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand, and
were to have the Law declared to them, be ſayd
<hi>come not at your wives;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> and his
Men when he deſired Bread of the High prieſt, was
asked by him if the young Men had kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
at leaſt from women, to whom <hi>David</hi> anſwered,
<hi>the women have been kept from us theſe
three dayes,</hi> by which a great Myſtery is hinted,
and exactly reſolved in this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>FOURTH</hi> of his <hi>Apologies</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the ſcandalous reproaches of <hi>Gregory Rickter</hi>
Chiefe Miniſter of the City of <hi>Gerlitz,</hi> and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi>
of the Country of <hi>Luſatia</hi> in Germany,
under prince Electour of Saxony: wherein
this Authors rare temper of Spirit, and his
deepe deciſion of the Matters layd againſt him,
are evident; In it Men may ſee as in a <hi>Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Glaſſe,</hi>
the great hurt any doe to their own
Soules, who revile and <hi>reproach</hi> another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the precept and example, of our bleſſed
Lord and saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who ſayd, <hi>when
men revile you, revile not againe: But Love
your Enemies, doe good to them that Hate
you and perſecute you, and pray for them that
DESPITEFULLY uſe you, that you may be
the Children of your Father which is in Heaven:</hi>
If we did know, how the wrath gets the upper
hand, when we <hi>forbeare</hi> earneſtly to exerciſe our
ſelves in the ſincere love to every one, without
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57399:6"/>
partiality and <hi>by</hi> reſpects, we would be more
diligent and watchfull over our own <hi>vile</hi> Hearts,
that we might preſerve our Crowne of rejoycing
which ſhall be put on to us in the World to Come,
from being defiled <hi>here</hi> by our remiſseneſs, it is
worth our watching, that neither the Devill nor
Man may hinder or diſappoint us of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Laſt</hi> treatiſe is the <hi>reſidue</hi> of his
<hi>Epiſtles</hi> to his friends wherein are many
heavenly advices and Inſtructions in the wayes
of God, and of the New Birth, alſo they informe
us, ſomewhat of his Converſation with Greate
Perſons and Officers of the <hi>Emperour</hi> and of the
<hi>Prince Electour of Saxony,</hi> a little after his
Baniſhment out of <hi>Gerlitz:</hi> among whom he was
lovingly received and his writings and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
well approved of, by the <hi>Prince</hi> Electour
<hi>himſelfe,</hi> alſo by his <hi>Councillours</hi> and <hi>Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Doctors</hi> and other; at the End of all is a
letter from Dr. <hi>Charles Weiſner</hi> about the whole
tranſaction of that affaire between <hi>Gregory Rick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Jacob Behme,</hi> together with the opinion
of Dr. <hi>Hoe,</hi> one of the Chiefe preachers to the
<hi>Prince Electour:</hi> which ſignifieth how loath they
were to Judg a Man whoſe Gifts they <hi>underſtood
not,</hi> but it doth <hi>no were</hi> appeare they either
thought the Author did not himſelf underſtand
them, or that they could not be underſtood by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
as ſome among us do.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the totall <hi>Remainder</hi> of of all his
workes Extant either in Print or Manuſcript,
which make up the Catalogue at the End of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57399:7"/>
40. Queſtion of the ſoule: and here at the End
of this Book; ſo that now all his workes are
printed in the Engliſh Tongue.</p>
            <p>Judg not according to the appearance, but
read, weigh, examine, and <hi>Judg righteous
Judgment;</hi> Or rather <hi>Judg not that we be not
Judged,</hi> which was one of the precepts of
<hi>CHRIST,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes: <hi>If we
would Judg our Selves, we ſhould not be
Judged.</hi> Judgment is the Mentall framing or
denouncing of the ſentence and ſeverity of the
Conſuming fire of Gods wrath, what in Reallity
any one is capable of and will certainly receive at
the Laſt day: which to doe upon <hi>others</hi> whom we
cannot know ſo well as we doe our ſelves, doth
<hi>awaken</hi> that fiery wrath in our ſelves, which
<hi>ought not</hi> to be, for if the Eternall Fire which
is in our hearts and ſoules, be kindled, againſt
a Perſon that is not lyable by his Guilt, <hi>if it
burne not</hi> him, it <hi>may</hi> and <hi>will</hi> burne Our ſelves;
but if we kindle that fire of Indignation <hi>againſt
our ſelves,</hi> as juſtly and deſervedly we may, it
will conſume Self-Love, and all the <hi>Dark
matter</hi> of our Sonles; and ſo change it into Light
as fire doth Iron; and then the Eternall fire will
have no Fewell to kindle upon, in us, <hi>now, or,</hi> at
the <hi>Laſt Day,</hi> but we ſhall be able to dwell with
Everlaſting Burnings as the Light doth in the Fire,
having <hi>Judged</hi> and <hi>Condemned our ſelves,</hi> for
we ſhall walke in righteouſneſs, and ſpeake
in uprightneſs, we ſhall deſpiſe the Gaine of
Deceits, and ſhake our hands from holding of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57399:7"/>
Bribes, and ſtop our Ears from hearing of Bloud,
and ſhut our Eyes from ſeeing of Evill, and then
we ſhall dwell on High; our Defence ſhall be the
Munition of the Everlaſting Rock of Ages.</p>
            <p>For a cloſe, I offer a <hi>Similitude</hi> of the Manner
how the laſt Judgment will be effected, to be Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
of: All <hi>Seeds</hi> ſown, will come up the ſame
that they were ſown, whether Good <hi>wheate</hi> or
<hi>weedes,</hi> this Life time is the ſowing of Thoughts
words and Actions, in our Spirits, ſoules, and
Bodyes, whatſoever is retained and Nouriſhed,
<hi>growes up</hi> in our Lives and Converſations, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Dies, be it the Good or the Bad, and the
<hi>power</hi> is <hi>fixed</hi> in the fruit of what Growes in us
<hi>here,</hi> and at the time of the Laſt Harveſt the Seed
will <hi>preſent</hi> its Fruit ready, and all will appeare in
the <hi>Effect,</hi> what hath been ſuppreſſed &amp; what hath
been cheriſhed, if good, it is well with us; if Bad we
are fit Fewell for the Eternall Fire, If our <hi>Deſires</hi>
which are the ſprouting of our ſeede be infected
with <hi>liking the Evill,</hi> or <hi>diſliking the Good,</hi> when
the Flower or Fruit comes to appear, we ſhall ſee the
Effect apparently in <hi>One Moment,</hi> of what was
hiddenly in the Seede from the <hi>firſt being</hi> of the
Thought, word or work, in us: Thus every Heart
may Judg of it ſelfe in <hi>this</hi> Life and amend in
time, but however then they will be <hi>layd Open</hi> to
the Eyes of our Selves and All Others, as the
<hi>FLOWER</hi> in <hi>one inſtant</hi> ſhewes the effect of all
the vertues and powers that lay hid in the Seed,
though they were really <hi>there</hi> before: as when we
ſowe; it may be we Expect Rare <hi>Tulips,</hi> or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

of Heaven. Our Soule hath in it the Seede of
<hi>Gods Image</hi> planted and ſown in the Inward word
of the Heart, &amp; it ſprings up in<note n="*" place="margin">Good Thoughts Words and Works are Gods.</note> 
               <hi>Good Thoughts,</hi>
which Image is righteouſneſs and Holineſs, and

to us, then Darkneſs, the Night and Sleepe doth

in the Corruption of our Mortall Body of Fleſh,
troubles us within, and the moſt pleaſing Thoughts
we have had, doe much moleſt us, which ſhewes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57399:8"/>
that the inward Corruption and the wrath of
God, hath gotten a life in Our Bodyes, ſo alſo if
it get a life in our Soules, it is much more
grievous, even to <hi>Eternity;</hi> which will manifeſt it
ſelfe in the Judgment, when all the Good that now
allayeth the Evill in us, ſhall be ſeparated
diſtinct apart by it ſelfe, and will be the
life of all Miſery, which is the <hi>ſecond</hi> or
Never Dying Death: On the otherſide; Health in
this Life, giveth alacrity, beauty and pleaſantneſs,

            <head>A brief, and well intended Anſwer of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
concerning his Book AVRORA,
againſt the enimicitions Paſquil or
Libel; in reſpect of ſome oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and falſly recited Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
or Concluſions, and
ill-underſtood by
this Libeller.</head>
            <p>1. INto what Calamity, Miſery, Anxiety, and great Perplexity,
we are <hi>plenged,</hi> by the heavy fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> is dayly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated,
in that we have not only thereby <hi>obſcured</hi> and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
our Noble Image; ſo that we cannot any more ſee or
apprehend the <hi>Divine Light;</hi> unleſſe, we become borne of
God againe; but alſo we have thereby, awakened and made
ſtirring in US, the Originall fierce <hi>Wrath</hi> of the Eternall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſo that, the fierce wrath venome and poyſon thereof, is become
Springing up and <hi>burning</hi> in us.</p>
            <p>2. Which is rightly called GODS Anger-Fire, which ſhould not
become ſtirring and Manifeſt, but continue ſhut up in the <hi>Center:</hi> for
it ſhould remaine ſhut up in the Love in the Divine Light, and be <hi>only
a cauſe</hi> of Life and Mobility.</p>
            <p>3. Which ſo long as it remaineth ſhut up in the Light, is a Spring
or <hi>Fountaine of Joy and Knowledge:</hi> but if the Light Extinguiſheth, is
an Evill Oppoſite Poyſon, wherein nothing qualifyeth or operateth,
but meere <hi>ſelf Enmity</hi> or Hatred; where inſtantly all Love and deſire
of Good hath an End.</p>
            <p>4. As we poor Children of <hi>Eve,</hi> muſt now feele in us with great
paine ſorrow and Miſery, how that fierce wrath <hi>ſtirreth</hi> driveth and
vexeth us; ſo that now we <hi>no more</hi> converſe one with another in
Love as Children of God, but very venomouſly, ſpitefully, <hi>hatefully,</hi>
murtheringly and enimicitiouſly, doe maliciouſly perſecute, <hi>diſpiſe</hi>
ſlander and reproach, alſo rob Murther and doe all manner of <hi>Evill,</hi>
and alwayes wiſh death, fierce wrath and all Evill one to another.</p>
            <p>5. Which great Miſery and Evill is ſufficiently to be <hi>traced</hi> in this
Libell, and out of what manner of Mind knowledge and Will it is
flowen forth, in that he undertakes, not only to <hi>Miſconſtrue</hi> the words,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57399:11"/>
but alſo to <hi>wreſt</hi> the whole underſtanding into a falſe meaning or
ſenſe, and to pronounce the Authour to be a <hi>Devill,</hi> and in a very
vaunting reproachfull, <hi>ſpitefull,</hi> Malicious and Odious manner, <hi>likeneth</hi>
the Authours Will or Intent, thought or ſence and mind, to the Devill,
without any <hi>knowledge</hi> of him, who he is, how he is, or what Spirit's
Child he is; <hi>whether</hi> he ſeeks God, or this World.</p>
            <p>6. Thus he takes upon him to infinuate his innate poyſon, into
the Heart thought or ſenſe and Will or intention of the Authour;
all which is very <hi>horrible,</hi> lamentable and Miſerable, in that he
knoweth not himſelf, or from what Mind <hi>his Zeal</hi> proceeds, and in
<hi>whoſe</hi> driving he runneth.</p>
            <p>7. He cannot ſee, that his whole writing, is a meer venomons
Paſquil or Libel: and Evill meaning or intention; for though that
which is ſpoken is not <hi>reproveable</hi> by him, yet he can not leave it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproached:
whereby a man may cleerly ſee, out of what Spirit, and
Mind it is flowen forth, and how the miſerable fierce wrath hath ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in him; and yet he dares ſet in his <hi>Title;</hi> that it is Chriſtian-like,
and well intended.</p>
            <p>8. But if he would ſet any thing <hi>better</hi> in the room of it, it might
indeed be born with. But I can find in all his Writing no <hi>Divine</hi>
Knowledge and Light; which yet he highly boaſteth of; as if he had
an <hi>enlightened</hi> Mind and Thoughts, and were Exerciſed therein.</p>
            <p>9. An Enlightened Mind or thoughts (if the Light be from God)
proceedeth <hi>friendly,</hi> and lovingly, and inſtructeth a Man, what he
ſhould Doe and leave undone; it owneth others in a brotherly <hi>Duty;</hi>
it hunteth <hi>not</hi> Mens Minds into the Jawes of the Devill, but they are
<hi>Gentle in reproving</hi> and teaching, with Good inſtruction: They reprove
in Generally, they catch not hold of a Man Privately particularly and
Singly, and make not a <hi>Den</hi> of Theevery or Murther, by the Good
Way ſide.</p>
            <p>10. An Enlightened Mind, which hath Exerciſed Thoughts (as
the Libeller would <hi>ſeem</hi> to have), knoweth the Gifts of God, that
they are <hi>without</hi> End or Number; that God Leadeth his Children
Wonderfully, and giveth to one a Divers gift to Expreſſe, than to
another: as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> alſo witneſſeth the ſame.</p>
            <p>11. That<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor, 12. 10, 11.</note> 
               <hi>God giveth to one from the gift of</hi> his Spirit to do <hi>Miracles</hi> or
Wonders; <hi>to another, to interpret Tongues; to a Third to Propheſie; to a Fourth
to ſpeak with Tongues,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and all from the</hi> One only <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> which
thus ſpeaketh from the Great Wonders of the eternall Wiſdome of
God, and thus Driveth and teacheth the Children of God, that the
unmeaſurable Wiſdome of God may <hi>appear</hi> in his Children.</p>
            <p>12. If the Spirit of God <hi>ruleth</hi> in a Man, then he is NOT Crafty
ſuttle Deceitfull<note n="†" place="margin">Tuckiſch.</note> trecherous Lying, aſtoniſhing, ambitious, but repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veable
teachable and <hi>Meek;</hi> he is not thorney prickley, <hi>Miſconſtruing</hi>
and vainly frivolous, he ſuddenly apprehends what is in a Man, and
from what Spirit he Speaketh: For the Spirit of God it ſelf knoweth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57399:11"/>
               <hi>it ſelf</hi> very well in a Man, it needeth no Witneſſe, it<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 7. 9.</note> 
               <hi>tryeth the Heart
and the Reins,</hi> Soul and Body, it ſpeaketh the Truth and <hi>diſgraceth</hi> or
reproacheth no man, it drives on all to that which is good, and <hi>prove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi>
Men to Righteouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>13. But this whole Libell or Paſquil, is nothing Elſe but a Miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruing,
poyſoning and <hi>diſgracing;</hi> he draweth the <hi>Scripture</hi> by the hair
of the Head, and corrupteth it, that he may but take occaſion to prick
with Thorns: beſides he hath <hi>no right</hi> underſtanding of the Scripture,
<hi>that</hi> muſt ſerve him as he will have it meane; that he may therewith
ſatisfie his fierce wrath, and bring it as fuell to his ficrce Fire, that it may

he ſhould thereby tread his Brother <hi>Abel</hi> under his feet.</p>
            <p>14. And yet his knowledge which he hath here brought forth to
the Day Light Concerning <hi>GODS Will,</hi> is as to one part in <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi>
and he largely buildeth the Babyloniſh <hi>Tower</hi> therewith, as it ſhall
be ſet before his eyes: which for my part I doe <hi>unwillingly,</hi> but now
neceſſity requires, I <hi>muſt</hi> doe it.</p>
            <p>15. Not for my own ſake, but for the ſake of thoſe. whom he hath
kindled with his <hi>envious</hi> fire, and poyſoned, and hath inſinuated into
them very Erroneous Opinions, eſpecially concerning <hi>Gods</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> 
               <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi>
of Grace: therefore it behoveth me to cleere my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>how</hi> I have apprehended it, in Divine knowledge, and how alſo
it is the True Ground, and <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> Foundation.</p>
            <p>16. His reproaching and contempt, giveth me and My Conſcience
<hi>no</hi> ſtumbling block, but it <hi>rejoyceth me</hi> that I ſhall ſuffer reproach and
contempt for the ſake of the Deare <hi>Name</hi> of JESUS CHRIST; and I
account it as ſent from God, and an Exerciſe of Faith.</p>
            <p>17. <hi>For, our Saviour CHRIST left us this at laſt, that</hi>

<note n="†" place="margin">Math. 10. 25.</note>For if they have called the Maſter of the Houſe <hi>Beelzebub;</hi> what will they

Man in us may ariſe, grow, and Live, in God.</p>
            <p>19. Alſo I <hi>Deſire not</hi> to rage againſt the Writer of this <hi>Libel:</hi> or to
contemne him, but to anſwer for my ſelf againſt his Malicious charge
againſt me: for he treateth <hi>therein</hi> againſt God and the Love of our
Neighbour, alſo <hi>againſt</hi> his own Conſcience, in that he layes to my
charge, and <hi>falſly</hi> wreſteth my Writings, which he himſelf doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand;
therefore he judgeth his own Heart, ſeeing he knoweth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:57399:12"/>
20. Surely, that I ſhould write concerning my ſelf <hi>as if</hi> I were a
Great Maſter of the Scriptures or Arts and Sciences of the Schools or
Univerſities of this World, <hi>that is NOT ſo.</hi> I am a poor ſimple Man,
and have my Skill and high knowledg, not from Art or from Reaſon, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have I ſought ſo Great Art, <hi>but from my Youth up</hi> have ſought only
the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of my Soul, how I might inherit and poſſeſſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God.</p>
            <p>21. But after I found in me, a powerfull Oppoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> the Driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Fleſh and Bloud, and the <hi>Mighty ſtrife</hi> between the Womans and
the Serpents <hi>Seed,</hi> I then once ſet my ſelf ſo hard in ſtrife againſt the
Serpents Seed, and <hi>my own</hi> Corrupt Nature, yet through the aſſiſtance
of God, that I ſuppoſed I ſhould overcome and break that <hi>innate</hi> evill
Will and Inclination, and unite my ſelf to the Love of God in Chriſt,
to hide my ſelf in the Heart or <hi>Boſome</hi> of God, from the terrible Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt
of the Anger of God, and the fierce wrath of the Devill, that, <hi>Gods
Spirit</hi> might rule Drive and Lead me.</p>
            <p>22. I purpoſed, to keep my ſelf <hi>as Dead</hi> in my innate forme and
Condition, till the Spirit gat a form in me, and that I laid hold on him,
that I might <hi>lead</hi> my Life through and in Him.</p>
            <p>23. Alſo I <hi>purpoſed,</hi> to Will nothing, but what I apprehended in
<hi>his</hi> Will and Light; he ſhould be <hi>my Will and Deed:</hi> which indeed was
<hi>not poſſible</hi> for me to Doe, and yet I ſtood in the Earneſt purpoſe and
reſolution, and in very earneſt <hi>ſtrife</hi> and Battle againſt my ſelf.</p>
            <p>24. And what thereupon came to paſs, none may well know but God
and my ownſoul: for I would rather <hi>loſe my Life,</hi> then Depart from that.</p>
            <p>25. Thus I wreſtled in <hi>Gods aſſiſtance,</hi> a good ſpace of Time, for the
victorious Garland or Crowne of Victory, which I afterwards with
the breaking open of the Gate of the Deep in the Center of Nature, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
with very great Joy, whereupon in my ſoul a <hi>Wonderfull
Light</hi> Sprung up, which was ſtrange to the wild Nature.</p>
            <p>26. Wherein I <hi>firſt</hi> apprehended, what God, and Man, was, and
what God had to Doe with Man; Which I never underſtood <hi>before,</hi>
neither did ſeek in ſuch a way: but as a Child that hangeth to its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and longeth after her, ſo did my ſoul after this Light, but with no
knowledge <hi>beforehand,</hi> what ſhould or would come to paſſe, but as as a
<hi>ſimple</hi> Child.</p>
            <p>27. I <hi>little</hi> underſtood the <hi>high</hi> Articles <hi>of</hi> Faith; <hi>before</hi>
only after the Manner of poor <hi>Lay</hi> people: much leſſe Did I underſtand
<hi>Nature,</hi> till the Light in the eternall Nature <hi>began</hi> to ſhine to me, whence
I became ſo very much Delighted and <hi>raviſhed,</hi> that I began, and would
needs <hi>write downe</hi> my knowledge for a Memoriall.</p>
            <p>28. For the Spirit picrced through and through like <hi>Lightning,</hi> and
ſaw into the Ground of the Eternity, or as a Tempeſt paſſeth on, what
it Driveth that it Driveth: ſo it went in me, I began to write as a Child
at Schoole, and I wrote thus in my apprehenſion and zealous Driving,
continually <hi>on</hi> and <hi>on,</hi> and <hi>only for my ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:57399:12"/>
29. I ſuppoſed all my life Long, <hi>not</hi> to be knowne thereby to any
Man, but minded, to keep it by me all my Life long for a <hi>Memoriall;</hi>
though indeed it was continually given to me to write of <hi>Things
to Come, as if it</hi> were for Many, <hi>as if</hi> it were a work laid upon me,
which I muſt undergoe.</p>
            <p>30. I found mightile the will of the New kindled Light-ſpirit: but
my ſoul was, to it, and in it, as a <hi>Child, without</hi> underſtanding. It went
thus into its Mothers Garden of Roſes, and Did as a Servant in Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
and all was given me after a,<note n="†" place="margin">After a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Myſticall Manner or by way of Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.</note> 
               <hi>Magicall</hi> Manner, to ſet it Down
in <hi>Paper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>31. For I wrote only my Mind ſenſe or <hi>Thoughts,</hi> as I underſtood
in the Deep; and made <hi>no Expoſition</hi> upon it; for I ſuppoſed not, that
it ſhould come to be read by other; I would keep it for my ſelf, elſe,
if I had knowne, that it ſhould have been read abroad, I would have
written <hi>more clearly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>32. Alſo the Labour of my Spirit in it and with it, was a continuall
Exerciſe; wherein my ſoul <hi>Dived</hi> the longer the deeper into the <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery</hi>
of the Eternall Nature, as a Schollar which goeth to School, and
ſtrenuouſly execiſeth himſelf.</p>
            <p>33. For, the Spirit of the Light loved my Soul exceedingly, as the
impartiall Reader will ſee therein, how the Spirit hath exerciſed it
ſelf, and <hi>repeated</hi> many things very often and ever <hi>Deeper</hi> and <hi>Cleerer,</hi>
from one ſtep to another, it was the right <hi>Jacobs Ladder,</hi> upon which
my ſoul climbed up, through Gods Will, <hi>whom</hi> it alſo pleaſed ſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
me, and to bring me into the Heavenly School, into the Holy
<hi>Ternary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>34, Concerning which, the Libeller <hi>knows Nothing,</hi> as his reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
writings teſtifie, that he underſtandeth nothing therein, but wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
like a Hiſtory, from the School of this World, which I leave to its
owne worth; but he boaſteth <hi>unjuſtly</hi> of Enlightened Eyes, ſeeing he
uſeth <hi>them</hi> for a <hi>reproach</hi> againſt the Children of God.</p>
            <p>35. Now <hi>this</hi> is THAT<note n="*" place="margin">The AV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RORA.</note> Book, which I wrote in my Childhood,
when I was but an A. B. C. Schollar, which the Libeller takes
upon him to Judge. But it was <hi>taken away from me</hi> by Satans Suttlety,
who thought to make merry with it, ſo that I <hi>knew not of it</hi> in Three
<hi>Years, where</hi> it was; I ſuppoſed it was quite gone a great
while before.</p>
            <p>36. Moreover I was bereaved of it <hi>before</hi> it was completed, ſo much
did <hi>Satan</hi> haſten to make merry with it, or a Bonfire of it, and <hi>heaped</hi>
Croſſes and tribulation, alſo Enemies enough upon me, of purpoſe to
Rob me of my Noble Pearl.</p>
            <p>37. He exceedingly alſo covered me with his <hi>Thorne buſh,</hi> by my
Opponents, that he might bereave me of my <hi>Jewel:</hi> till <hi>after</hi> THREE
Years, it was ſent to me <hi>Written</hi> from <hi>highly Learned</hi> People, out of my
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57399:13"/>
writings, who earneſtly exhorted me to finiſh it; Then I ſaw that ym
writings were ſtill Extant, and wondered at it, that it had ſo hapen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>them,</hi> and underſtood, that they had had them in their hands for
TWO Years before, and that all along One Good Friend had given them
to another to write out <hi>Copies</hi> of them.</p>
            <p>38. I underſtood Alſo, that they were in the Hands of <hi>Many</hi> Men
altogether <hi>unknowne</hi> to me, and that Many enlightened and <hi>Honeſt</hi> Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Hearts had great ſatisfaction therein, who ſought not Poyſon, but a
<hi>right may</hi> to the Divine Life and Chriſtian Converſation <hi>therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>39. Who doubtleſſe had not ſuch venomous Eyes, that the Aſpect
of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> ſo ſuddenly ſlipped into the <hi>Center</hi> of their Mind, and
<hi>ſought</hi> to pervert it, but have left it to the Spirit of God, and <hi>asked</hi> Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<hi>which</hi> alſo they obtained.</p>
            <p>40. But ſome of them are ſo <hi>highly Learned</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> perſons that
the Libeller may not well compare himſelf with them, but I have <hi>not
heard</hi> that any of them ſhould ſay, that the <hi>Devill</hi> was ſitting therein. I
firmly beleeve, that he is ſitting in the Libeller, in Mind Eyes Heart
and Thoughts, and ſuddenly <hi>infected</hi> him, and drave him on to ſtrife.</p>
            <p>41. For, he acknowledgeth himſelf, in the Introduction, that he
read it over in <hi>haſte,</hi> and had not <hi>leiſure enough;</hi> ſurely, the Serpent had
very ſuddenly captivated him, and after that left him <hi>no time</hi> to ponder
it, but only to make Sport with it. Certainly, if the Libeller, had ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
further, he had found out the Authour.</p>
            <p>42. And if he had <hi>written to me</hi> never ſo little, to know how I came
by ſuch Meanings and Writings, I would have written to him of it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<hi>friendly</hi> and Chriſtianly; this would have become a Chriſtian well,
eſpecially an enlightened Mind.</p>
            <p>43. But S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Libeller, I conceive thereby, that your Artfull Mind,
is ſtanding in BABEL, and would thereby ſlay ABEL, <hi>therefore</hi> you
muſt anſwer it before the Judgment of God, let this betold you, you
muſt know that you have oppoſed the A. B. C.</p>
            <p>44. God hath beſtowed ſo much Grace, that in the<note n="†" place="margin">The Three Principles.</note> 
               <hi>Second Book</hi>
which is made, we have written <hi>much cleerer</hi> then in the<note n="*" place="margin">The Avro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</note> 
               <hi>Pirſt,</hi> and alſo,
then you have written in yours; The ſenſe is a little <hi>Deeper</hi> opened
to US, then to YOU.</p>
            <p>45. You muſt know, that I ſee YOUR Writings much <hi>better then</hi>
your ſelf <hi>underſtand them;</hi> you would flee or ſoare aloſt, to ſhew your

Myſtery of God: all would be well, and men would be at peace, if
you were not found to be a <hi>Scorner;</hi> as alſo having a proud unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

            <p>46. Read <hi>my Three</hi> Books <hi>of the</hi> Becoming Man or <hi>Incarnation of</hi>
JESUS CHRIST, how we muſt be conceived and enter <hi>into,</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming

            </p>
            <p>47. Alſo; read the Book of the <hi>Threefold Life</hi> of Man, and ye
will find the Elernall <hi>Divine Nauture,</hi> and alſo the <hi>Outward</hi> Nature of the
Starres and Elements a little deeper and More <hi>fundamentally</hi> Deſcribed,
then in your Libell or Paſquill: you will well ſee what Divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is, Moreover, what man is to doe and leave undone, and
<hi>What Faith and Bleſſedneſs or</hi> Salvation is.</p>
            <p>48. Alſo you will find your <hi>Crippled,</hi> and altogether <hi>Miſexpounded</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>Gracious Election, <hi>rightly</hi> in the Ground: that will better

            <p>49. <hi>Yours,</hi> bringeth Men to <hi>Deſperation,</hi> to vanity, and into

to the Light, that they may ſee what the <hi>Holy</hi> Scripture <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth
by</hi> Gods Election.</p>
            <p>50. Alſo you find therein, <hi>right</hi> knowledge of God; and of the

before it: you boaſt of your knowledge, yet Divine ſkill and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſtandeth <hi>not</hi> in Reaſon, but in the Light of God.</p>
            <p>51. If you will ſpeak ſo highly of God, you muſt underſtand and
fundamentally know ALL the THREE Principles; elſe your
Speech continues to be only a fighting with a ſhadow, and ſatisfieth
<hi>not</hi> the Hungry Mind; Read my Book of <hi>the Three Principles</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Subſtance; what will that availe, you ſhall ſee, whether I am a
Man or no, you ſhould not ſeek <hi>in</hi> ME for a Devill, as you have done
in a very unchriſtian Manner, towards me, which ought highly to be
<hi>reproved</hi> in you. If you will rightly ſeek the <hi>Heretick</hi> whom you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
you will find him in your own <hi>Boſome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>52. For he is a HERETICK, that wreſteth the Scriptures <hi>falſly:</hi>
and you doe it not only to my meaning, and with my words, that are
<hi>hidden</hi> to you, which ſtand yet partly in a Magick underſtanding, but
you <hi>pervert</hi> the Scripture and draw it falſly to your Meaning, of the

<hi>forbid</hi> any Man to <hi>ſearch</hi> further about it.</p>
            <p>53. Yes <hi>indeed,</hi> the Devill might thereby be manifeſted or revealed;
and that <hi>he</hi> would not have: or likely my Book hath hit you upon the
Calviniſt <hi>Veine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>54. I cannot remedy that, if you or others <hi>will not</hi> read my Book,
let it alone; it is not Printed; who bid any, write a Copy of it?
leave it to me, I have written it only for my ſelf; it is nothing to you:
I have <hi>not</hi> run about with it, and <hi>preſented it</hi> to any body, it is come forth
without my will and Deſire, and without my knowledge; as they that

it; that is an untruth; A Chriſtian <hi>ſeeketh not</hi> his own honour, but
Gods honour, and, in his <hi>Love,</hi> his Neighbour's; CHRIST ſought not his
own honour but his Father's: He deſired no honour from Man: what
ſhould it be deſired for then by me?</p>
            <p>56. The <hi>True knowledge</hi> of God is not from this World, but from
God, why ſhould a lodging then be ſought for it here: behold and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider

            <p>57. I ſay with good ground, <hi>in ſuch a way</hi> you have no underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that he may diſcerne us <hi>both.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>58. He that deſireth a <hi>full</hi> Explanation, let him read the book of

            </p>
            <p>59. Truly I ſay, that my Book which he oppoſeth in <hi>ſome places

yet if any deſire more cleering, it ſhall be afforded him;
and if he deſire proof thereof, it ſhall alſo be given him.</p>
            <p>62. But he that deſireth it not, I have <hi>not</hi> written it for him, let him

            <p>65. Moreover, what is it, that Men contend about in the Chriſtian
Religion? and diſpute much? The Chriſtian Religion is no ſtriſe
contention or Opinion, it conſiſteth in the New <hi>Regeneration</hi> out of
Chriſt, in Faith, from the Holy Ghoſt, in Humility, Love and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>66. A Chriſtian muſt be <hi>borne</hi> of Chriſt, he muſt have a Chriſtian Will
and deſire, and lead a Chriſtian Converſation. It is <hi>not only</hi> knowing
will doe it, and comforting ones ſelf with Chriſts ſufferings, and be a
<hi>Diſſembling</hi> Hypocrite in the preſence of God; to ſpeak one thing,
and Will, Deſire, and Doe another; and let the evill poyſonous
<hi>Worm</hi> of the <hi>Corrupt</hi> Natures Fire, burn ſtill, and be but a
Lip or Mouth-Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>67. It lyeth not in knowing much, that a man ſhould tickle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
with Chriſts ſufferings, and ſet them aloſt on the Pinnacle, and yet
<hi>reteine</hi> the Evill Envious kindled poyſonous worm Continually in the
Heart, and continually carry <hi>Fewel</hi> to its Fire: I ſay, that very Mantle,
will become helliſh fire to Many: that he hath known Gods will, and
will not enter thereinto, and give up himſelf to him.</p>
            <p>68. A Chriſtian muſt break his own <hi>Naturall</hi> Will, and give himſelf
up into Gods Will; he muſt alwayes quench his Fire-will, and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
bring <hi>all the Thoughts</hi> of his Mind into the Obedience of
God, into the Love and Mercy of God in CHRIST, into his becoming
Man or Incarnation, Suffering, Dying, Death, and Reſurrection; he
muſt will nothing, but Gods Will in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>69. But this is his Deſire, that God may be his Will and Deed, that
God in him may be his knowledge; he ſhould continually <hi>ſlay</hi> the will
of his Fleſh, and deſire only GODS <hi>Will</hi> in himſelf: that it may rule,
Drive, and be the Deed, in him.</p>

Will.</p>
            <p>74. In <hi>Adam</hi> we loſt Gods, will, and in the Promiſe of the <hi>Womans
Seed</hi> we found it again: for it preſented it ſelf with or by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe

            <p>75. But he that hath not willed, but let the fierce wrath of the

up into it ſelf, and kept him in the <hi>Abyſſe</hi> of the Originall in the

            <p>76. In that very regenerate will of God, <hi>Iſrael</hi> is become <hi>born</hi> in
God, and in that very will, is, the Word of Eternall Life, which
maketh Divine Eſſence, wherein the <hi>Divine Will</hi> becometh genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>77. And that is entered into <hi>Mary's</hi> Eſſence, and Opened the, in

for it is in the Word of the Light of Life: and to that very will we

            <p>78. In <hi>Adam,</hi> the Ability was ſhut up in Death, for the Divine Light
Extinguiſhed in <hi>Alams</hi> ſoul; and in the Promiſe, it ſtood before the

            <p>79. Though indeed in it ſelf, it was not Extinguiſhed, but <hi>Adams</hi>

the Divine Principle; it had received the ſpirit of this World for a

            <p>

hath another ſource or <hi>quality,</hi> then the Light; ſo the ſoul is a Magick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire,
introduced into <hi>Adam</hi> out of the firſt Principle: and with the Mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>81, For its Eſſence it hath been alwayes from Eternity, but in the

            <p>82. But if not, and that it ſtandeth barely in his Magick-fire, and

THAT burneth in him.</p>
            <p>87. But Gods kingdome ſtandeth in Power, in Love, and Joy; it
ſearcheth after nothing, for it hath all things <hi>beforehand:</hi> only the ſoul
ſearcheth, it would enter into the kingdome of Reſt; and in the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

that: It were <hi>better</hi> to be in Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>88. Therefore is all contention and ſtrife, concerning the kingdome

            </p>
            <p>89. A True Beleeving Chriſtian, ought <hi>not</hi> to ſtrive or Contend

Wilt thou boaſt thy ſelf of an Enlightened Mind, then thou muſt know

<hi>not</hi> be wavering and unſetled, and to think that God hath <hi>not created it</hi>

the bowed perverted Scriptures and leaveſt out the <hi>Beſt, viz.</hi> the Love
of God, which willeth not the Evill; and ſo thou Caſteſt a ſnare about

            <p>96. Well: thou art come to my warehouſe, to which I have invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

if thou wilt not buy, let it alone.</p>
            <p>97. I have not invited the <hi>Devil's</hi> Advocates to it, but
Chriſts Children, who would faine be ſaved: although thou boaſteſt
Much, that the <hi>Election</hi> of Grace is not to be ſearched for out of Chriſt,

<hi>as if</hi> God would not have all Men, <hi>as if</hi> he hardened ſome out of a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate</hi>

            <p>98. In that reſpect I will ſhew you <hi>ſome</hi> of my Wares; if you will
buy, well and good, and ſo you may be a brother in Chriſt: but if not,
<hi>thou</hi> thy ſelf <hi>wilt not,</hi> God would indeed, but if thou thy ſelf <hi>wilt not,</hi>
then thou hardeneſt thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>99. The CENTER out of which Evill and Good, floweth, is IN

it hath the <hi>Center</hi> to the fire, and Light, <hi>in it ſelf;</hi> to evill and Good;

            <p>105. But the Paſquill or <hi>Libeller,</hi> underſtandeth NOT at all what
Gods Love and Anger are; or what is called God. He will ſpeak of

            <head>Here followeth further Information, and
Refutation of the Paſquil or Libel,</head>
            <head type="sub">It is noted with the<note n="*" place="margin">The Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Page of the Libel.</note> Number, where it is
to be found in the Libel.</head>
            <p>108. <hi>Firſt</hi> the Paſquil ſets down for an <hi>Entrance,</hi> a
great <hi>Regiſter</hi> of the Propheſies of CHRIST
concerning the <hi>laſt Times;</hi> How <hi>Seducers</hi> and
HERETICKS, would come, and ſay, <hi>Here is
Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>that we ſhould not then believe them:</hi>
And that the Libeller doth to the End, that he may make to himſelf a
ſtately Entrance and Dore of <hi>reproach</hi> to the Paſquill or Libel; That
he may proclaime the <hi>Authour</hi> for a HERETICK: and a man may ſoon
ſee what he hath in his Mind and Thoughts, and what Spirit's Child he
is; his Chriſtian vein, ſuddenly appears, ſo that he may <hi>lay it</hi> upon
the Authour.</p>
            <p>109. Indeed Chriſt and his Apoſtles have <hi>rightly</hi> propheſied, and
it is, or ſtandeth ſo, in the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and it proteedeth at preſent with
great prevalency, when every one <hi>Cryeth,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Math. 24. 23. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Here is Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>There is
Chriſt;</hi> Run after Me, you is a <hi>Heretick</hi> and <hi>Babel</hi> at preſent is quite
kindled with Clamour: it burneth alſo in the fire of Gods Anger, in
its ſenſeleſſe<note n="†" place="margin">Turbulency.</note> 
               <hi>Sectarianiſme,</hi> ſo that indeed,<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 24. 24.</note> 
               <hi>if it were poſſible the Elect
might be doveived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>110. But why doth the Paſquill or Libeller, <hi>wreſt</hi> the words of the
Propheſie, and not ſay what an HERETICK is? He thinks he hath
catched a Mouſe, and <hi>ſeeth not</hi> that he himſelf ſticks faſt in the Trap.</p>
            <p>111. Certainly, HERETICKS are ſuch people as are generated or
born out of or from <hi>Reaſon,</hi> out of or from ART which is from the
Stars, which make an unſtedfaſt Matter or Subſtance, whereas to day
<hi>one</hi> Conſtellation or Configuration, is made, and to Morrow that is
broken by <hi>another;</hi> where a man muſt have many things to build with;
where, a man doth but <hi>Exchange</hi> words, and <hi>Expounds</hi> words with words;
where, the Mind <hi>never Experienceth</hi> what the Power and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the words are, where a Man runs about with Reaſon and Art,
and ſeeketh only favour and honour thereby; that the Man might have
reſpect and repute.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:57399:18"/>
112. And when a Man cannot reteine that, then they Cry in the
Eares of the <hi>Worldly</hi> power and <hi>Authority,</hi> and raiſe, Calumnies, Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
Wars and Shedding of Bloud; then the <hi>uproar-Maſter,</hi> danceth
in his heart; now thou haſt gotten the day; and fall on to <hi>make Laws</hi>
about Chriſtian Liberty; and to Eſtabliſh them with worldly authority,
and put <hi>penalties</hi> upon Men, that they muſt believe and doe what thoſe
uproar-Maſters have <hi>carved out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>113. And then when it comes into a <hi>Cuſtome,</hi> then they call him a
<hi>Saint</hi> or Holy Perſon, and Men deviſe and ſaine Continually more and
more to <hi>adde</hi> to it, how they may <hi>flatter</hi> and ſerve the uproar-Maſters;
in the mean time not forgetting the <hi>Belly-Idoll,</hi> they draw all with ſuttlety
and Tricks, and draw the SCRIPTURE of the Saints and Holy Men
by the Haire of the Head to it, and that with great mixture of their
own with it.</p>
            <p>114. And there then is the right ANTICHRIST, for he doth what
himſelf will, and not what God will; he is from or out of himſelf,
<hi>born</hi> or generated out of or from the Starry-Reaſon, and not out of or
from God.</p>
            <p>115. Such, <hi>Men ſet up,</hi> for Teachers, to the World; and theſe now
are meer Contenders, ſtrivers, boaſters, and HERETICKS, and ſtir up
nothing but Wars, Plagues, and Vexation; they Teach only reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
words, they ſtrive about words, they diſpute about the <hi>Shell,</hi> and
let the <hi>Kernel</hi> lye, alſo they know nothing thereof, for the kernel is a
<hi>Myſtery</hi> to them;<note n="†" place="margin">Exod. 32. 19.</note> they <hi>Dance</hi> about the <hi>Calf</hi> as in <hi>Moſes</hi> time; and
leave <hi>Moſes</hi> alone with God in the Mount, and likely ſlight whatſoever
he ſhall ſay, when he cometh from the Mount.</p>
            <p>116. They take not themſelves concerned, though <hi>Iſrael</hi> be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nay rather they will help towards it, and put the Sword into the
Hands of <hi>violence;</hi> thus the Anger of God will have it, that he may but
devour THOSE, who are NOT Gods children, and ſeek not God, but
their <hi>own</hi> honour.</p>
            <p>117. But he is a ture Chriſtian, who is <hi>Obedient</hi> to CHRIST, And,
when thoſe uproar-or Alarum-Maſters,<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 24. 23. 26.</note> 
               <hi>Cry</hi> out, <hi>here</hi> is the Church of
Chriſt, or <hi>there</hi> is the Church of Chriſt, <hi>Behold, he is in the Wilderneſſe, He
is in the Chamber;</hi> Alſo in the Supper, And the other ſaith no, he is not
there, <hi>goe not then forth;</hi> for CHRIST ſaith;<note n="†" place="margin">Math. 28. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Behold I am all the dayes
with you, even to the End of the World;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Math. 24. 27, 28.</note> 
               <hi>as the Lightining Springs up in the

<hi>be the Coming of the Sonne of Man:</hi>

gather together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>118. CHRIST is alwayes the true Chriſtians, <hi>Carkaſs,</hi> his Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is continually IN them, they continually Eat his Fleſh and Drink
his Bloud, and forſake boaſting and playing the <hi>Herotick;</hi> they contend
with none, they have no contention; Chriſt is with them, they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
or born out of Chriſt, and Live in him, they ſeek only <hi>how
they may doe his Will.</hi>

119.<note n="†" place="margin">Note.</note> Hath<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 8. 2.</note> Chriſt <hi>made us free from the Law of Sinne,</hi> what need we
then long hunt after any other? why ſhould we deſpiſe and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
others, ſince we are all extracted or begotten out of ONE Soul
and <hi>Body?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>120. In <hi>Adam</hi> we fell with <hi>thst</hi> ONE only ſoul, into Death and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Darkneſſe; In <hi>Chriſt</hi> we become again New-born in that ſame ONE
only ſoul: And nothing More is wanting, but that we all ſhould Enter
again into THAT ONE only ſoul of Chriſt; and become ONE in
CHRIST again and <hi>not Two.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>121. As the Libeller, ſhamefully, falſifies it, as to <hi>Adam,</hi> and hides
and <hi>obſcures</hi> the true Ground, and in the ſted thereof ſets up a plea as
Advocate for the Devill: whereas he knoweth very well, that the
<hi>Authour,</hi> in his Book hath rejected that thing, yet he will ſet it up again,
and the Paſquill or Libeller is ready for that End and purpoſe, if any
underſtand the Matter;<note n="†" place="margin">Syrach. <hi>or</hi> Eccleſiaſtions.</note> 
               <hi>Syrach</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that throweth emong the Dogs,
and hits one, it will be diſcerned well enough</hi> which he hits.</p>
            <p>122. Obſerve, I pray, his holineſſe, when he makes ſuch an Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
that he can <hi>give</hi> the Authour <hi>up</hi> to the Devill, then he holdeth
it forth for a great piece of Holineſſe, that he will not Judge the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,
but leave the judgment of him to them to whom it belongeth,
where likely he means the Devill, or the Hangman; as he all along
<hi>pronounceth</hi> the Authour to be a Devill.</p>
            <p>123. O, Great Babyloniſh holineſſe! Mind repentance or elſe thou
wilt not eat of Chriſts Carkaſſe: The Authour is no Devill, but ſeeketh
his<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 24. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Carkaſſe</hi> CHRIST, and Deſtreth nothing Elſe.</p>
            <p>124. Chriſt ſaith,<note n="†" place="margin">Math. 12. 34.</note>

               <hi>Can a Man gather Grapes of Thorns, or ſigs of Thiſtles;</hi>
If a Toad, did ſit under a ſweet-ſmelling Medicinall Hearb, or in an

            <p>125. And ſo it is alſo with an <hi>Envious</hi> Man, that ſucks only poyſon,
out of all that is very Good; He turns all to the <hi>worſt,</hi> he cryeth down

               <p>126. THere the Libeller begins to reprehend, that which ſtands written
in my Preface,<note n="†" place="margin">In the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the <hi>Avrora.</hi> Verſ. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>viz:</hi> Till the Prince of Light came,
out of the Heart of God, and became a Man in
Nature, and wreſtled in his humane Body, in the
power of the Divine Light, in the wild Nature:
that Kingly or Royall Branch or Twig, grew up
in Nature, and became a Tree.</p>
               <p>127. What fine knowledge he hath concerning the Soul of Man, and of the
right Man, is here eaſie to be<note n="*" place="margin">Perceived or Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> traced; he rejects this deſcription, and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth
nothing</hi> thereof, how the Author's mind and thoughts are; for
it is written in a Magick underſtanding: for the Author himſelf, who
knew not of this Libeller, or of any other reader; He ſuppoſed, he had
made a Labour for himſelf only, but <hi>God</hi> hath turned it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>128. But that, the Libeller, perverts the Authour's meaning and
Mind and Thoughts, very ſooliſhly, and giveth it a ſtrange underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a ſimple Man may very well underſtand it; though indeed, the
Libeller with Conſutation, <hi>is ſo blind,</hi> that he knoweth not what he
babbles: He ſpeaks juſt nothing of the meaning of the Authour, but
brings <hi>another ſenſe</hi> in to it, that he may have but ſomwhat to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend.</p>
               <p>129. For, the Authours Text is very right, but the Paſquill or Libeller,
underſtandeth nothing therein, which by the <hi>foregoing Words</hi> of that
Text is Demonſtrated very well to him, what the Authour ſaw if he
had rightly taken in, the Magick underſtanding, elſe he ſhould have
let it quite alone.</p>
               <p>130. The Authour, had under his Pen, the poor <hi>fallen</hi> Man, and
the poor captive periſhed Soul, and ſhewed, how it becometh helped
or ſaved again.</p>
               <p>131. He looked in this Deſcription, not only into the <hi>outward</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
into the 4 Elements and Stars, but into the <hi>inward</hi> Kingdome,
into the firſt Principle, whence the ſoul originally ariſeth; He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth
ſomwhat elſe by the <hi>Wild Nature,</hi> then the Paſquill or
Libeellr underſtandeth. He meant <hi>not</hi> Stars and four Elements, alſo not
the beaſtiall fleſh which is of this World, as the Paſquil or Libeller re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth: but he meant the Center, the <hi>fire-ſource</hi> of the ſoul, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57399:19"/>
had Extinguiſhed the Light of God, and introduced the earthly Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
from the kingdome of this world.</p>
               <p>132. He underſtood, how the poor ſoul after its fall became a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely
Magick-Fire in Gods Eternall Anger-fire: and THAT he called
<hi>the wilde Nature;</hi> for the ſoul ſtandeth in the Eternall beginningleſs
Nature, in the firſt Principle of God the Father, and is the Cauſe of the Image of God.</p>
               <p>133. It hath all formes of the Eternall Nature in it, It hath in the
Eſſence, <hi>ever</hi> been, from Eternity; but, in the Creation, paſſed into a
Creature: It is from or out of the <hi>fire,</hi> wherein God the Father <hi>ever</hi>
generateth forth his <hi>Light;</hi> And is in its Originall without beſides or
beyond, the Light of God, an anxious horrible Subſtance, like a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
brimſtone worme: for it is a Magick-fire, from or out of Gods fire,
which is the Eternall Natures, <hi>Originall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>134. Which when the Eternall fire of God moved it ſelf, became
deſirous to have its re-awakening, and Compriſed in its deſire, an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
<hi>ſimilitude,</hi> according to and out of it ſelf; underſtand, out
of the <hi>Deſire</hi> of the Eternall Fire, which is only a Spirit; and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth
in the will, which is the One-Element-fire, which ſtandeth in the
inward re-awakening, and Conſumeth that againe continually in the
Compriſed <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Deſire; and continually thereby only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakeneth
it ſelf, as is to be ſeen in the kindling in the outward King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>135. Out of that Eternall Nature, out of its properties, underſtand out
of the Eternall, which is the <hi>Center,</hi> and a Principle in it ſelf; a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick-fire
of God, which it ſelf, is God the Father according to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Nature; the Eternall Light becometh Generated, and ſhineth
in that Nature in <hi>its properties,</hi> that the properties of the fierce wrath
and Anger become <hi>not</hi> manifeſt, but are only a cauſe of the ſhining
of the<note n="*" place="margin">Or Light.</note> Life.</p>
               <p>136. For the Light maketh alſo a <hi>Center</hi> in it ſelf; with other proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;
That which in the fires property is a fierce wrath, that in the
Lights property is a deſire of the ſubſtance of the Light, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
Love, and <hi>Meekneſs:</hi> That draweth the fierce wrathfull fire into
it ſelf, and Extinguiſheth the fierce wrath of the fire therewith, ſo
that out of the fire, <hi>Joy</hi> cometh to be.</p>
               <p>137. For the Anxious fires deſire is after Meekneſſe, and the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
deſire, is after the fiery Eſſence, that it may be a Life; Thus
each deſire maketh a Will-Spirit, one out of the Fire, and one out of
the Light, and yet is but ONE only, but with TWO <hi>properties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>138. And God calleth himſelf a God, according to the Lights pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
underſtand,<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 34. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>a God of Love,</hi> Meekneſs <hi>and Mercy;</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Fires property, he calleth himſelf, <hi>an Angry Zealous or</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Deut. 4. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
God, and a Conſuming fire:</hi> and yet he is but ONE and <hi>not</hi> TWO:
as in the Book of the <hi>Threefold Life,</hi> and in the <hi>Three Principles,</hi> is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57399:20"/>
mentioned and expounded at Large with many Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>139. This, thus briefly mentioned, is now the Moſt Originall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
where, in the fires property the Eternall Nature is underſtood,
and much more in the <hi>formes</hi> to Fire, which make the Eternall <hi>Center,</hi>
as is mentioned in the <hi>Three Principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>140. And underſtand further, That the Deſire in that Eternall Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
according to both properties, hath from Eternity Continually been
a <hi>Delight</hi> Longing or Luſt, to ſeek and to finde it ſelf, and hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
found it ſelf in it ſelf, each property its like, <hi>both</hi> according to
the fierce Wrath and the Love, according to fire and light, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to all formes to the Fire, and according to all formes in the Light,
of the Love.</p>
               <p>141. That which is found hath been the Spirits <hi>Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Glaſſe:</hi>
in the Love in the Light, the Looking Glaſſe is called <hi>Gods
wiſdome;</hi> and in the fierce wrath of the fire, it is called <hi>Gods Anger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Eye.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>142. In this Looking-Glaſſe, hath been ſeen from Eternity, the
ſubſtance of this world, <hi>viz.</hi> the Third Principle: for it hath ſtood in
the Magicall Deſire, indeed <hi>not</hi> in Subſtance, but in the Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Glaſſe,
in the <hi>Deſire</hi> of the Eternall Nature, wherein the Spirit hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
it ſelf, and with the beginning of this world, with the moving
of the Eternall Nature, by the Spirit of God in the harſh or aſtringent
<hi>Fiat,</hi> created it into a <hi>Subſtance,</hi> into a ſimilitude, according to the
property of the Eternall Nature, according to all formes to Nature,
and according to all Formes in Nature.</p>
               <p>143. Whatſoever, became generated <hi>in Nature,</hi> viz. in the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
belonged to the kingdome of God, and hath the Name of God.
But whatſoever became generated <hi>in the Formes to Nature;</hi> that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to the dark angwiſh-world.</p>
               <p>144. All properties became moved, and each property ſet it ſelf in
its Looking-Glaſſe, for a<note n="*" place="margin">Note.</note> FIGURE, according to its Eſſence; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
according to the Deſires Eſſence.</p>
               <p>145. The harſh or aſtringent <hi>Mairix</hi> to Nature, was the <hi>Fiat,</hi> which
<note n="†" place="margin">Formed or faſhioned.</note>compriſed the ſimilitude and Image, and brought it into a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
Beeing, through Gods moving.</p>
               <p>146. Underſtand, according to the will-ſpirit, which goeth forth
out of the <hi>Lights</hi> Center, and according to the Will-ſpirit which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth out of the <hi>fives</hi> Center; and yet is but ONE, But in TWO
properties, viz. <hi>Two</hi> Magick deſires.</p>
               <p>147. As Men ſee in the Creature, how Love and Anger ſtick in
<hi>One Minde,</hi> and yet have <hi>Two Centers,</hi> all accordingly as the Outward
Will-ſpirit diſcovers in any One, ſo is the awakening in Love and
Anger: and Men ſee in this world in the Creatures, how there are
<hi>Evill</hi> and <hi>Good,</hi> Wolves and Sheep, Serpents and good Fiſh, Poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Toads and lovely handſome Beaſts and living Creatures; Every
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57399:20"/>
one out of <hi>its</hi> Mothers property, ſpringing from the Eternall Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall.</p>
               <p>148. In this Eternall Looking-Glaſſe of the wiſdome of God, hath
alſo the ſoul of Man, from Eternity by the Spirit of God, been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered <hi>in the Eſſence,</hi> which with the beginning of the firſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the <hi>Fiat</hi> of God, became formed into a<note n="*" place="margin">NOTE.</note> Creature, according
to the ſimilitude of the Birth or Geniture of God.</p>
               <p>149. The Spirit of God diſcovered in the Looking-Glaſſe of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<hi>an Image,</hi> according to his ſimilitude or likeneſſe; underſtand
out of <hi>both</hi> the Magick fires in the Principle of the Light, a Totall
<hi>entire</hi> ſimilitude according to the Deity, as to all the <hi>Three</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>150. If we would conceive of the Eternall divine Birth or Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
in the Light of the <hi>Majeſty</hi> in its <hi>Tri-unity,</hi> and then of the ſoul
of Man in its Image, Subſtance, and Beeing, we cannot perceive or
think upon it better, in a ſimilitude, then in <hi>Fire and Light;</hi> that is a
direct or Exact ſimilitude.</p>
               <p>151. The Fire ſignifieth the Eternall Nature, which ariſeth origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
in the Deſire in the Eternall Will, continually, from Eternity in
Eternity, where the Eternall Will-ſpirit, out of the Eternall <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
viz. out of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the Deity, manifeſteth or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth
it ſelf, by or with its going forth into the Deſire of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and divideth it ſelf, into <hi>two</hi> worlds or Principles, <hi>viz.
Darkneſs and Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>152. Where each World hath its <hi>Center</hi> to the ſource or quality
in it ſelf, and yet neither departed away from the other, but ONE
world is in the OTHER, the Light holdeth the darkneſs captive, but
the darkneſs is a cauſe of the fire, and the fire is a cauſe of the Light:
For in the Harſh or aſtringent and ſtern darkneſs, ariſe the Eſſences
or the ſource or <hi>quality</hi> of fire and Nature.</p>
               <p>153. Now we ſee plainly, in the fire and Light a <hi>twofold</hi> ſource
or quality, and deſire; and we ſee alſo how the fire burneth out of
a Dark Subſtance, which ſignifieth the Dark world dwelling in <hi>it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>154. The Fire ſignifieth the Eternall Nature, in the Fathers Will
in the <hi>Deſire</hi> to Manifeſtation or Revelation; the Light ſignifieth the
Eternall Liberty, without, beſides, or beyond, Nature, which manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth Nature in <hi>Subſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>155. The Fire, hath in it ſelf, the dark worlds <hi>fierce</hi> wrathfull Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
and the Light hath in it ſelf, the Eternall <hi>Liberty,</hi> viz. a meek,
ſoft, quiet ſtill Habitation or delight.</p>
               <p>156. But now the Liberty and Meekneſs without the fire, would
not be manifeſted or revealed; but would be a ſtill Nothing, and the
fire alſo would have no Glance or Luſtre, without the Liberty; and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57399:21"/>
ſo the fire and Light would be <hi>Nothing</hi> without the Deſire; that is the
<hi>Center</hi> to the <hi>Genetrix,</hi> and holdeth or containeth in it ſelf, the FIAT
of the word.</p>
               <p>157. And in the Deſire becometh Generated, the Eternall Word,
or the <hi>underſtanding,</hi> alſo the wiſdome, as alſo the Anger-Looking-Glaſſe,
out of the Root of the dark <hi>Center.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>158. And we ſee further, how the Fire dwelleth in the Light, and
the Light in the Fire, and <hi>one</hi> comprehendeth <hi>not</hi> the <hi>other;</hi> the Light
becometh generated in the fire, <hi>viz.</hi> out of the dying or Conſumptibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
it ſhineth out of the Death, and ſincketh downe to the Death in
it ſelf, and maketh in it ſelf <hi>another</hi> ſource or quality then the fire is:
another Principle, where another Life goeth forth, <hi>viz.</hi> Meekneſs
and amiable delight, whereas in the fire, there is only anguiſh and
paine.</p>
               <p>159. For, we ſee, that the Light is as it were a Nothing in reſpect of
the Fire, and its Root: for it is <hi>incomprehenſible,</hi> and it ſignifieth to us,
the Eternall Liberty, without, beſides, or beyond Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Subſtance, and the Angelicall world; and yet it is <hi>All:</hi> for it is
all power of all Eſſences out of the Fire, and out of Nature in the
Light, and is a Life of the underſtanding, alſo of Reaſon and Senſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
or Thoughts; whereas in fire is nothing but an oppoſite or <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi>
will, to be underſtood.</p>
               <p>160. For, the formes of the fire Nature, are themſelves at <hi>Enmity</hi> one
with another, the Harſhneſs Bitterneſs and Anguiſh, are one againſt
another, which are the fires <hi>Root,</hi> where, in the Deſire ſtandeth the
harſhneſs, and in the harſhneſs the drawing, where the <hi>Nothing</hi> becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
brought into <hi>Somwhat,</hi> and the will overſhaddoweth it ſelf, with
that which is drawn in.</p>
               <p>161. Whence, in the Deſire, a darkneſs and Overſhadowing exiſts,
and then alſo, out of the <hi>firſt</hi> deſire, the other or <hi>ſecond</hi> Will, to go out
from the Darkneſs, and yet there is no flying away from one another,
but the other or ſecond Will entereth into it ſelf, into the Liberty
without beſides or beyond the <hi>Deſire</hi> in the Darkneſs, and ſo bringeth
the property of Nature <hi>along</hi> with it.</p>
               <p>162. That fiery property, is, the Liberties; <hi>viz:</hi> the Nothings <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
or Manifeſtation, for thus exiſteth the Glance or Luſtre and ſhine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For in the Liberty, is, the property which is brought along with
the other or ſecond will, <hi>put into</hi> the ſtill meek delightfull habitation,
and out of that very property, a Love-deſire cometh to be.</p>
               <p>163. Thus, the Fire and the Light, in a <hi>ſunilitude,</hi> ſignifieth to us the
divine Subſtance, alſo the Soul and its Image: The MATTER out
of which the Fire burneth, ſignifieth the <hi>Forms</hi> to the Eternall Nature,
and the Dark world, and the FIRE ſignifieth the <hi>property</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:57399:21"/>
164. The GLANCE or Luſtre of the Fire, ſignifieth the <hi>Liberty</hi>
without beſides or beyond Nature; The ſhining or the LIGHT
ſignifieth the <hi>other</hi> or ſecond world, <hi>viz:</hi> another or ſecond Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which becometh generated out of the firſt, <hi>viz:</hi> out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
property, and the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God out of the Father.</p>
               <p>165. The POWER or vertue of the ſhining of the Light, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
the <hi>Heart</hi> of God, <hi>viz:</hi> the Divine Center, as alſo the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
'Ingenium or <hi>Wit,</hi> and Wiſdome: for in the power of the
Light ſtandeth the Right Life.</p>
               <p>166. The twofold Spirit which originateth in the Fire, with a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
ſource or <hi>quality,</hi> viz: <hi>Heate and Aire,</hi> ſignifieth to us in a
ſimilitude, the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God: the HEATE ſignifieth the <hi>Anger</hi> and
fierce wrath of God, according to the Eternall Nature of the dark
world, according to the property of the fierce wrath; And the Meek
AIREY, ſignifieth the property of Meek Light, in the <hi>Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſire,</hi>
out of the ſource or quality of the Light.</p>
               <p>169. The MEEKNESSE of the Light ſignifieth to us in a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
the Divine <hi>Subſtantiality,</hi> or the <hi>water</hi> of the Eternall Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Paradiſe is underſtood, and in the <hi>fiery</hi> property, Heaven.</p>
               <p>168. Now we ſee, how all Fire draweth the Aire again to it ſelf,
and <hi>burneth</hi> in the power of the Aire; for where Fire can have no Aire,
there it extinguiſheth; for the Aire bloweth up the Fire, and bringeth
the Subſtantiality of the Light into the Fire <hi>again,</hi> viz: the Meekneſſe
of the Light, underſtand the Watery Matter, whence the <hi>Glance</hi> in
the Fire Originateth.</p>
               <p>169. For, the Meekneſſe originateth from the Liberty, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
or beyond the Fires Nature, <hi>viz:</hi> in the <hi>Nothing,</hi> and they <hi>ever
pant</hi> the one after the other: The Fires or the Natures fierce wrath:
panteth after the Meekneſſe; and the Liberty or the Nothing panteth
after the Manifeſtation or Revelation, which in <hi>Nature</hi> becometh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
or Revealed.</p>
               <p>170. Now we ſee, that the <hi>Light</hi> affordeth a very friendly richly
Joyfull Spirit, out of the ſource or quality of the <hi>Fire;</hi> that friendly
and richly amiable aſpect or Spirit, <hi>originateth</hi> out of the indrunk wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſource or quality, of Meekneſſe, <hi>viz:</hi> out of the Liberty.</p>
               <p>171. And, in that, the Fire draweth the Lights meek Subſtantiality
into it ſelf, thereby it <hi>giveth forth</hi> that indrunk meek Spirit through
the fierce wrath of Death, through the Conſumptibility, into the Light
again, and <hi>bringeth</hi> the Nature-property along with it: as we may
apprehend by the Aire, that it is a power of Every Life, and it is
<hi>yet in it ſelf</hi> not Nature; but ruleth as a mighty potent Spirit IN
Nature.</p>
               <p>172. Thus in this Type or Reſemblance, is underſtood, the Divine
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57399:22"/>
Subſtance, and alſo the Eternall Naturér out of which, Deſire and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
is become generated the <hi>Third</hi> Principle, <hi>viz:</hi> this outward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
World: and become Created in the beginning, into a <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall</hi>
Beeing, together with all Creatures.</p>
               <p>173. For, from the Eternall <hi>Mother,</hi> is the beginning or inceptive
Mother come to be, for where there is nothing, there nothing comes
to be: but where ever <hi>ſomewhat</hi> hath come to be, there it is come to
be out of the Eternall, which hath been, without beginning, and it is
the <hi>Eternalls</hi> Similitude, Image, Subſtance, and Propriety, and yet we
<hi>cannot</hi> ſay, that it is ſundred from the Eternall, but it is diſtinguiſhed,
the one world is in the other, and each poſſeſſeth <hi>it ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>174. God is in Every thing or Subſtance, but every thing doth not
comprehend him; That only comprehendeth him, that is gone forth
out of <hi>his</hi> Eternall Subſtance; underſtand, that is of <hi>his</hi> Subſtance,
that doth ſtand in HIM: For, God dwelleth not is the Out-birth of
the <hi>outward</hi> Nature, but in the inward in himſelf.</p>
               <p>175. God indeed is himſelf, ALL, but all is not called and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be God, in reſpect of the <hi>difference</hi> of the ſource or <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
Nature is not God; but God is manifeſted or revealed through
Nature; God is underſtood alone in the Eternall Light, according to
the ſecond Center, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Liberty: and yet is <hi>not</hi> ſevered <hi>aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
from the Eternall Nature.</p>
               <p>176. For if a ſhining is to be, then there muſt be fire, and yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
there is <hi>ſhining</hi> of fire, without or beſides the Liberty; which the
divine world ſignifieth.</p>
               <p>177. The <hi>Glance</hi> or Luſtre of the Fire, ſignifieth God the <hi>Father,</hi> and
the <hi>Formes</hi> to Fire ſignifie the Eternall <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>power</hi> of the Light
ſignifieth the <hi>Heart</hi> of God, <hi>viz:</hi> the true Deity, for it produceth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or ſecond <hi>Center,</hi> of another ſource or quality, then the fire, <hi>viz:</hi>
a Love-Deſire, and <hi>Meekneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>178. And the <hi>Out going Spirit,</hi> out of the Glance of the Fire into
the power of the Light, out of the Lights Subſtance, drunk in by the
Fire, <hi>viz:</hi> out of the Love and Meekneſſe, ſigniffeth to us rightly the
<hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> which continually goeth forth from the Father and the
Sonne into the Divine power and <hi>Subſtamiality:</hi> as the Aire from the
Fire and Light, and <hi>ruleth</hi> in the Lights Subſtantiality.</p>
               <p>179. The outward world is <hi>througly</hi> a ſimilitude of the Inward,
for the Inward hath manifeſted or revealed it ſelf with or by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
whereby a Man may <hi>underſtand,</hi> what the Inviſible God, in the
hidden Myſtery, is.</p>
               <p>180. Man ought not to think, that God is ſomewhat abſent from
any thing, or ſpace or place, for he filleth ALL, but in his own
Principle, <hi>viz:</hi> in the<note n="*" place="margin">Light world</note> 
                  <hi>Middlemoſt</hi> World, which he himſelf is.</p>
               <p>181. And now when the Inviſible God once moved himſelf, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Eternall <hi>Magia,</hi> viz: in the Eternall Nature-Deſire, he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
to himſelf in his wiſdome, his <hi>likeneſſe</hi> out of the properties
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57399:22"/>
of all the Three worlds, and out of Every Eſſence and property, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Creatures and <hi>figures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>182. For the <hi>Work-Maſter,</hi> viz: his Spirit, was in all things or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<hi>viz.</hi> in the Divine Light world, Angells and pure ſpirits; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
out of the Eternall Nature, <hi>viz:</hi> out of the Eternall Fires and
Lights property, out of <hi>Divine</hi> Subſtantiality.</p>
               <p>183. For a Spirit hath the Eternall <hi>Center</hi> of Nature in it ſelf, if it
be an Eternall Spirit: it hath all <hi>formes</hi> to Nature, <hi>viz:</hi> of the dark
world, and alſo of the Light world, in it ſelf, for it is proceeded out
of Gods <hi>Mouth,</hi> it is Nature, elſe it were no <hi>manifeſted</hi> or revealed
Spirit, with or among the Spirits.</p>
               <p>184. Out of the Eternall Nature, God hath manifeſted or revealed
his wiſdome; for in the Eſſence, <hi>viz:</hi> in the divine wiſdome, hath
the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Spirits and Creatures been from Eternity; but with
the Moving of God the Father, it paſſed into a <hi>formed</hi> Creation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the property of the Eſſence, <hi>in Verbo Fiat,</hi> in the Word
Fiat, in the word of Power, and therefore were the Angells called
<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 1. 7.</note>
                  <hi>Flames of fire,</hi> but throughly Enlightned with the Light of God.</p>
               <p>185. The Light of God dwelleth in <hi>their</hi> fire-flames, ſo that the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource
or quality, is <hi>nor</hi> manifeſted or revealed in them, but <hi>if</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
manifeſted, then they have loſt the divine Subſtantiality, out of
which the fires <hi>Glance</hi> Exiſteth, and that Spirit ſtandeth barely and
nakedly in the Dark world, as is done by the Devills.</p>
               <p>186. A Spirit, [proceeding] out of Nature, is a <hi>Magick Fire</hi>- ſource
or quality, and is deſirous of ſubſtance, or of the Subſtantiality of <hi>its</hi>
forme: the deſire maketh ſubſtance, and bringeth that ſubſtance into
its <hi>Imagination;</hi> that is the Magick fires, <hi>viz:</hi> the Spirits, <hi>Corporeity,
whence</hi> the Spirit is called a<note n="†" place="margin">NOTE.</note> Creature; Alſo that Subſtantiality is the
Spirits <hi>Food</hi> whereof the fire liveth or burneth.</p>
               <p>187. Here now is underſtood, the Devills and alſo Mans fall, for
according to the Eternall Nature, they are <hi>both</hi> out of <hi>one</hi> Originall;
the Devill was an Angell, and ſhould have ſet his Imagination in the
Light of God, <hi>viz:</hi> in Love and Meekneſſe, in the Divine Subſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
and then he <hi>had conceived</hi> divine Subſtantiality in his Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and his light had continued <hi>ſhining;</hi> his Magick fire-ſource or
quality, had <hi>eaten</hi> of Gods Meekneſſe, and then alſo, had the fire-ſource
or quality burned in ſuch an Eſſence and property, and then he had
<hi>Continued</hi> an Angel.</p>
               <p>188. But he turned himſelf back into the <hi>Center,</hi> after the Mother
of the <hi>Genetrix,</hi> and ſet his Imagination, [to goe] after the <hi>formes</hi> to
Nature, and would needs rule terribly in the might of the Fire; he
contemned the Meekneſſe, <hi>viz:</hi> the Second Principle, and would do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineere
<hi>over</hi> God.</p>
               <p>189. What he now deſired, that he received alſo into his fiery De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire;
<hi>viz:</hi> the Subſtantiality of the <hi>fiarce wrath,</hi> out of the formes of
the Dark world, out of his <hi>own Center;</hi> Thus now is <hi>that</hi> Subſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57399:23"/>
the food of his Spirits Fire, and his Fire-ſource or quality
ſtandeth in a dark fierce wrathfull Eſſence, and can conceive <hi>no</hi> deſire
more, in the Meekneſſe, <hi>viz;</hi> in Gods ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>190. Thus he is a Devill, and dwelleth in the <hi>Center</hi> of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<hi>viz:</hi> in the formes to Nature; for <hi>his</hi> Light is extinguiſhed, he
can <hi>not</hi> kindle that againe, it ſhineth no more out from his Eſſence,
<hi>neither can</hi> his Imagination any more reach or attaine it. and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth
a ſierce wrathfull fire-ſource or quality, in the <hi>Darkneſſe,</hi> and
eateth of the dark Subſtantiality, and ſtandeth in another Principle.</p>
               <p>191. The <hi>Word Fiat, Verbum Fiat,</hi> which figureth his forme or
Image in him, is the <hi>Mother</hi> of the Dark world; <hi>viz:</hi> the ſterne formes
to Nature, according to every Spirits property; as the ſource or
quality in the Center is, ſo is alſo the Will-Spirit.</p>
               <p>192. Now then, the light being <hi>withdrawne,</hi> he can frame no other
will, then his mother is, in <hi>her</hi> formes: for as the <hi>Genetrix</hi> is, ſo is
alſo the will-ſpirit out of the <hi>Genetrix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>193. Thus underſtand alſo concerning Mans Soule; which is alſo a
Magick-fire-ſource or quality, out of the Eternall <hi>Center,</hi> out of the
Eternall Nature; for after God created the body out of the Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
then he introduced the Spirit out of all the Three Principles
thereinto: He ſhould be a <hi>ſimilitude</hi> and <hi>Image</hi> of God; underſtand,
according to, and out of, all the Three Worlds, <hi>viz;</hi> out of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Fires Nature, and out of the Lights Nature, and then out of
this outward worlds Nature, wherein the outward Man liveth.</p>
               <p>194. For, God breathed into him the Living Breath, and then Man
became a <hi>living ſoul:</hi> Now what can God breath <hi>other</hi> out of himſelf,
then himſelf; for God is the ſubſtance of all ſubſtances; but <hi>all</hi> is <hi>not</hi>
called or known to be God: He calleth himſelf a GOD only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his <hi>Heart,</hi> according to the property of the Light world, <hi>viz:</hi>
according to the Love and Meekneſſe, according to the ſecond Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
               <p>195. God breathed into the Created Image the Spirit out of all the
Three Worlds, <hi>viz:</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Himſelf: viz:</hi> the Eternall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginningleſſe
Magick fire-ſource or quality, out of all formes of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Nature, that is, the <hi>firſt</hi> Principle, and it is the property of the
Father, who according to Nature calleth himſelf an Angry Zealous
or Jealous God, and a Conſuming fire.</p>
               <p>196. And then the <hi>Center</hi> of the Light, as a Sparkle out of his Heart,
out of which the Divine Will goeth forth, which appropriateth or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niteth
it ſelf to God againe: and <hi>Imagineth</hi> according to its Mother,
<hi>viz:</hi> according to Gods Love and Meekneſſe; That is the <hi>Second</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
wherein the Angelicall world conſiſteth.</p>
               <p>197. And Thirdly, the Spirit-Aire, with the Spirit of this outward
world, out of the Starres and Elements, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> Principle;
Thus Man became an <hi>Entire</hi> Totall Image according to God, out of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57399:23"/>
all the Three Worlds; An Image of God, wherein God dwelleth,
wherein God beheld found and manifeſted or revealed himſelf.</p>
               <p>198. Now the Eternall Word was his <hi>Law,</hi> of his ſpirituall Nature,
that this introduced and <hi>in-breathed</hi> ſpirit of Man, ſhould introduce
its Imagination, into <hi>no other</hi> ſource or quality, but only into Gods
Love and Meekneſſe; It ſhould <hi>eate</hi> only of the Divine Subſtantiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and <hi>drink</hi> the water of the Eternall Life, and then its Body had
Continued Paradiſicall.</p>
               <p>199. The Body had paradiſicall fruit to Eate, which grew for it
IN all fruits: The outward Body of this world, was in the ſource
or quality of the Light world, as it were ſwallowed up, and yet it
<hi>was</hi> there: As the Light ſwalloweth up the Darkneſſe, and holdeth
it captive in it ſelf, and yet the Darkneſſe remaineth, but, in the Light,
is <hi>not</hi> Manifeſted.</p>
               <p>200. So alſo ſhould the outward <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of this world; as alſo the
inward ſource or quality of the Fire, out of the firſt Principle, ſtand
<hi>hidden</hi> in the Paradiſicall Subſtantiality, and ſource or quality; and
Man ſhould bring his life and <hi>will</hi> into the Paradiſicall ſource or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>201. He ſhould ſet or put <hi>his Spirits</hi> Imagination into the Heart of
God, <hi>viz:</hi> into the Lights <hi>Center,</hi> and then had the Soul continually
eaten of the Lights Subſtantiality; underſtand, the ſouliſh Fire had
conceived or <hi>received</hi> the divine ſource or <hi>quality</hi> into it ſelf, and
had burned forth, in the divine ſource or quality, <hi>viz:</hi> in Love and
Meekneſſe.</p>
               <p>202. Through that burning or Life, would the divine Subſtance
have been introduced into the <hi>outward</hi> Body; <hi>viz:</hi> heavenly Feſh;
and the Holy Body would have ſtood in the <hi>Tincture</hi> of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Principle; and the outward <hi>Dominion</hi> of the Outward World
would have ſtood hidden in the Inward World, and have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
in the Outward.</p>
               <p>203. <hi>Such</hi> a Body alſo was created in the Beginning, <hi>viz:</hi> out of
the inward <hi>Subſtantiality</hi> of the pure Element, which is manifeſted in
Paradiſe, and an outward Body of or from the Foure Elements, which
ſtood <hi>manifeſted</hi> in the outward World; but the inward ſhould leade
the Dominion, and hold the outward as it were ſwallowed up, as
the Light doth the Darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>204. Underſtand, each Principle ſhould ſtand <hi>free</hi> and barely in it
ſelf, and ſet or put its Imagination or <hi>Deſire</hi> into God, and then
would Gods light have filled all in All, and the Earneſt ſevere Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource
or quality, of the firſt Principle, <hi>viz:</hi> the Eternall Nature of
the Dark World; as alſo the outward Nature and ſource or quality
of the Starres and Elements, <hi>would not</hi> have been manifeſted.</p>
               <p>205. Man would have lived in the Divine Love ſource or quality,
and would have <hi>continued</hi> Immortall and incorruptible, no ſickneſſe,
neither want neceſſity nor Death would have touched him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:57399:24"/>
206. Therefore now if ſuch a deſire <hi>is to be</hi> in Man, out of which
the Will-Spirit ſhould barely be inclined or directed into God, then
muſt <hi>Divine</hi> Subſtantiality needs be in the Souls Fire: out of which
ſuch a Will-Spirit <hi>might</hi> exiſt.</p>
               <p>207. For, out of no Earthly ſource or quality, nor out of the Dark
Worlds ſource or quality doth any <hi>divine deſire</hi> exiſt; Earthlineſſe,
knoweth nothing of God; alſo the Dark World hath no Divine Love
or Deſire in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>208. Whereby we know, that <hi>we,</hi> according to the ſecond Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<hi>viz:</hi> according to the Paradiſicall Angelicall World, <hi>have had</hi>
fleſh and bloud, out of the heavenly Eſſence and Subſtantiality, which
was the right Body of the Soul; and therein ſtood the Image of
Heaven.</p>
               <p>209. And the Spirit <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the Magick-Fire of the Soul, which

                  </gap>, was the true ſimilitude of God;
according to the <hi>Trinity of GOD,</hi> the Image wherein God
dwelleth; and wherewith God manifeſteth himſelfe: For that very
Spirit is like all Angells in Subſtance and Beeing; of which Chriſt

                  <hi>in the Reſurrection they are like the Angells of
God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>210. When God had created <hi>Adam,</hi> he then ſtood in the Paradiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
World, <hi>viz:</hi> in the Image of God; but God knowing, how he
with his Noble <hi>Jewell</hi> between the Inward Dark World, and
then alſo the outward Elementary World, ſtood faſt bound to BOTH,
therefore he gave to the Souls Nature, <hi>the Law and Cormandment,</hi>
and ſaid;<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not eate of the Tree of knowledge of Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
for on what Day thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt dye the Death,</hi> that is, dye
away from the Divine World; and in THEE, will, the Dark World,
and then alſo, the Outward world, become manifeſted, and get the
<hi>Dominion</hi> in THEE.</p>
               <p>211. As alſo then it was ſo done, when <hi>Adam</hi> began and ſet or put his
Deſire and <hi>Imagination</hi> into the Outward World: then the <hi>ſouls fire</hi>
did Eat of the forbidden Fruit, and brought the Earthly ſource or quality,
and the ſubſtantiality of this World <hi>into</hi> his Noble Image, into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſicall
Angelicall World.</p>
               <p>212. He <hi>brought</hi> the earthly ſource or quality and ſubſtance, into the
Pure Elementary Fleſh, which was created out of the Divine ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,
ſo his light <hi>extinguiſhed;</hi> that is, he went with his will-ſpirit
out of the Divine ſubſtantiality into the Earthly, into the Stars and
four Elements.</p>
               <p>213. <hi>Thus the Image became Earthly, and</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 10. 30.</note> fell among the Murtherours,
who ſmote it, and wounded it, and left it lying half dead: <hi>thus</hi> Adam went
out of Jeruſalem toward Jericho, <hi>as Chriſt ſaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>214. The Stars and Elements, put on to the Body the fierce
wrathfull earthly Cloaths or Garments of their Eſſence and ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57399:24"/>
and the Dark-world gave to the ſouls fire alſo its fierce wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſevere or earneſt and <hi>ſtern</hi> ſource or quality, and now the Souls
fire, burned in that <hi>fierce</hi> wrathfull property, and ſo God and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Heaven was Loſt; for the Divine Image diſappeared or <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,</hi>
and the Earthly, began to appear; the Outward <hi>Fiat</hi> gat the
predominancy.</p>
               <p>215. As ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> was overcome by the Spirit of this World,
then he fell into <hi>ſleep, viz.</hi> into the outward <hi>Magia,</hi> which ſignifieth
or reſembleth Death; for the outward Kingdome hath beginning and
End, and <hi>muſt</hi> break off from the Inward; THAT, is its Death; for
the outward Life goeth again into its <hi>Mother,</hi> out of which it is proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>viz:</hi> into the Myſtery of the Stars and Elements, and the Inward
Life of the Soul, continueth in the Dark world, <hi>viz:</hi> in the Eternall
Nature, whence it is <hi>Originated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>216. Therefore, the <hi>Regeneration</hi> from or out of the Heart
of God is <hi>neceſſary</hi> for us, that the Dark Souls fire ſhut up in the fierce
Wrath and Anger, might conceive or receive Divine ſubſtantiality
againe, that its Light, might <hi>ſhine</hi> again.</p>
               <p>217.
And THAT is it which I wrote in my<note n="†" place="margin">Avrora.</note> BOOK.</p>
               <p>That all was ſhut up in the Anger; Till the Prince of
Light, out of the Heart of God, came, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Man in Nature, and wreſtled in the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Light in the Wild Nature.</p>
               <p>218. By Nature, the Author, underſtood, the <hi>Eternall</hi> Souliſh
Nature, the Center of Nature, which, in the Soul, after the Image be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
Earthly, became <hi>Wilde and Strange</hi> as to the Divine

               <p>219. And <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Children muſt needs have <hi>continued Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi>
in the <hi>wild</hi> Nature and in the Anger and fierce wrath of God;

                  <p>228. Art thou he that muſt Judge me: then learn firſt the Authour's

came out of the Heart of God, and became a man
in <hi>Nature,</hi> it is not, in the <hi>Wilde Nature,</hi> but it is,
And <hi>wreſtled</hi> in his <hi>humane</hi> Body, in the Power of
the Divine Light in the <hi>Wild Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>229. The Queſtion is. What is the <hi>Wilde</hi> Nature, wherein the Prince
of Light out of the Heart of God, wreſtled in the <hi>Humanity;</hi> Is it earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fleſh? Or the ſource or quality of the Starres and Four Elements?
No: For the Sake of that, the Prince out of the heart of God, came not.
But it was the <hi>Soul,</hi> out of the eternall <hi>Fathers Nature,</hi> which had through
its Imagination, and Luſt, introduced Death and Earthlineſſe into it ſelf;
and awakened the Dark worlds fierce wrathfulneſſe in the Anger of
God, and there was no Remedy, neither in Heaven, nor in this world,
unleſſe the Prince of the Love of God, came, and wreſtled with the
fierce wrathfull Anger of God, and <hi>quenched</hi> the ſame in the Humane

                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:57399:26"/>
230. And therefore the Prince of the Love of God, <hi>viz:</hi> Gods
own Heart, became A MAN, in the <hi>humane</hi> Nature, in humane Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, not in a ſtrange One, as the Libeller wonderfully brings it in here:
alſo <hi>not</hi> in the <hi>Wilde,</hi> of the Starres and Elements, not in Beaſtiall Fleſh
of the Corrupt or periſhed out-birth of the Four Elements, it is <hi>not</hi> in
that Eſſence, that the <hi>Deity</hi> is united; it is not the Wild Adamicall
Fleſh which Chriſt <hi>aſſumed</hi> to himſelf, as the Libeller explaineth it, who
yet hath no underſtanding at all of the Eſſence, wherein God is become
MAN.</p>
                  <p>231. <hi>Adam's</hi> Soul had not an outward four Elementary Body on it;
for it ſtood in Gods Love, in Paradiſe: Paradiſe is not Four-Elementary,
it ſtandeth not in FOUR Elements but in ONE: It is the Divine delight
or Habitation.</p>
                  <p>232. God dwelleth not in the Out birth of the Four Elements,
but in Heaven in the pure Element, that is his Spirits Corporeall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality,
and that Subſtantiality <hi>Adam</hi> had alſo for a Body, and
ſtood in the outward Body, as the Gold, hidden in the Courſe or droſſie
Stone.</p>
                  <p>233. The <hi>Inward</hi> Body keepeth the <hi>outward</hi> body hidden, as the Light
doth the Darkneſſe; and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God dwelleth in the Inward bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
for it containeth in it ſelf the Second Principle, <hi>viz:</hi> the Kingdome
of Heaven; an Image of the Divine Subſtantiality; the <hi>Soul</hi> hath its
Meekneſſe therein, it did Eate of that very Body wherein God dwelt:
Its Fire became allayed or Meekened therefrom; for it received <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi>
Gods Love and Meekneſſe.</p>
                  <p>234. But as ſoon as the Souls Fire, began, and <hi>Imagined</hi> according
to the Earthlineſſe: and would Eat of the four Elements and Starres,
then the outward Kingdome <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Third</hi> Principle, <hi>drew-in</hi> the firſt
Principle, into the Souls Fire, and alſo into the heavenly Body; and
obſcured the Noble Image, ſo that it fell, into inability, into <hi>Sleep;</hi> Then
it was in inability, as it were captivated in Death, for the Earthly
Source or Quality, dwelt <hi>now</hi> therein, whence the Souls Fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
fierce wrathfull, ſtinging, and Murtherous, for it muſt now
eate Evill and Good, and the Noble Image of the Similitude of God
<hi>Diſappeared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>235. Now when God ſaw, that the Noble Image was diſappeared
or <hi>vaniſhed,</hi> and that the outward kingdome became Lord in it; His
<hi>Mercy Pittied</hi> it, and promiſed it the Womans Seed and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher
of the Serpent, and ſayd; * <hi>The ſeede of the Woman ſhall Cruſh or
Bruiſe the Head of the Servent,</hi> which hath brought thee to Fall; He
ſayd the Seed of the Woman, ſhould doe this.</p>
                  <p>236. Underſtand, in the right <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>heavenly</hi> Subſtantiality
which in Adam was <hi>ſhut</hi> up in Death, would God become Man; Not in
the Earthly, introduced into the Noble Image and Soul; into the right
humane Nature of the ſecond Principle, in which God dwelt before
<hi>Adams</hi> fall, into that very Eſſence ſhut up in Death, is Gods Word En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57399:27"/>
THAT, is the Seede of the Woman; and the Word, is Gods
Seede.</p>
                  <p>237. God was the Man or <hi>husband</hi> of it, who ſowed his Word or
Heart into the Womans humane Eſſence; underſtand, in the Eſſence
of the <hi>Soul</hi> and of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> is God become Man, Chriſt was One of
the Perſons of the Holy Trinity, and is become <hi>Adam;</hi> underſtand,
<note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 46. to the 49.</note>
                     <hi>the ſecond Adam,</hi> out of and in the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and yet remaines to be
what he was.</p>
                  <p>238. He is not Strange to us, but is our <hi>Brother;</hi> as he ſayd after

                  </p>
                  <p>239. If Chriſt had aſſumed on himſelf a <hi>ſtrange</hi> Seede, ſuch as I am
not, and which in <hi>Adam</hi> I was not, what would that help me? where
would my poor Soul remaine? <hi>How</hi> could he then be the Womans
ſeede, or my Brother?</p>
                  <p>240. He promiſed to Abraham, <hi>not</hi> a ſtrange Seede of the Woman,
but ſayd;<note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 22. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>In thy ſeede ſhall all People become bleſſed:</hi> that is, in <hi>Thine,</hi>

Live againe: Chriſt ſhall live in THEE, in thy Image, and thou in

                  </p>
                  <p>241. It concerned God <hi>not only</hi> as to a Sacrifice, whereby his Anger
ſhould be appeaſed, that he let his Heart become Man, and let his
Sonne be <hi>Cruciſied;</hi> that ſo his will might be reconciled; No, But

<hi>therefore</hi> muſt Chriſt, when he dyed on the <hi>Croſſe</hi> enter into Death,
into the Anger of God.</p>
                  <p>244. The Love of God in Chriſt, went in the humane Soul into
the firſt Principle, <hi>viz:</hi> into the ſource or <hi>quality</hi> of the <hi>Anger</hi> in the

Seede of Woman, much <hi>leſſe</hi> Abrahams Seede.</p>
                  <p>248. But that the ſuttle Libeller, will make the <hi>Virgin</hi> MARY ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall,
and ſaith, ſhee was begotten or Extracted out of the Seede
of God, e're Chriſt became conceived in her, and will thereby bring
a <hi>ſtrange</hi> ſeede thereinto, which is not humane, that is very <hi>Hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
and <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and he ſhould doe well to ſmell into his own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
before he condemneth others, and paſſeth his judgement upon
them.</p>
                  <p>249. Is not <hi>Mary</hi> extracted or begotten of <hi>Joachim and
Anna,</hi> alſo Naturally conceived and borne, as all the children of
<hi>Adam;</hi> then let him demonſtrate it, elſe his conceit will till then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine

                  <p>250. But if he ſay, if <hi>Mary</hi> were begotten of <hi>Joachim</hi> and <hi>Anna,</hi> then
were <hi>Chriſt</hi> begotten of <hi>ſinfull</hi> ſeed; as his high flowne Spirit, runneth

                  <p>251. He ſpeakes indeed of the High <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of <hi>Mary,</hi> but he draweth
it to a <hi>ſtrange</hi> Seede, out of which <hi>Mary</hi> was begotten or extracted:
but he ſaith not with any ground what <hi>kinde</hi> of ſeede that was, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>252. For, the Humane Eſſence, is to Him <hi>throughout ſinfull,</hi> he will not
at all be born of Man, but of God, in like manner as if God in Chriſt

                  <head>Therefore obſerve my Confeſſion of Faith,
and acknowledgement, as it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Exactly.</head>
                  <p>255. God ſayd to <hi>Adam:</hi> when he ſtood in Paradiſe; and lived in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
ſource or quality and ſubſtantiality: <hi>What day thou eateſt of the
Tree of knowledge of Good and Evill, thou wilt dye the Death;</hi> by Dying, he
meaneth not only, the <hi>Outward Body,</hi> which with the Beginning of Sinne,
<hi>firſt</hi> became <hi>Living.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>256. For the Outward Body, fell not down inſtantly, when <hi>Adam</hi>
tranſgreſſed the Commandment and Dyed; but he gat now the <hi>Great
Life,</hi> and became <hi>Lord:</hi> before, he was weak or impotent, and the right
Man potent or Mighty: he formerly came <hi>behinde</hi> and waited on the
Image of God, and was a ſervant, but when the Soul introduced
Earthly ſource or quality, then he was <hi>Lord;</hi> and the Image was ſhut
up in Death.</p>
                  <p>257. The Spirit is the Life, the Fleſh is not the Life, The heavenly
Fleſhes Life was <hi>Gods</hi> Spirit, and the Earthly Fleſhes Life was this
<hi>Worlds</hi> Spirit.</p>
                  <p>258. When the Earthly drew into the Heavenly, and took the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,
then the heavenly vaniſhed or diſappeared; for the <hi>Spirit</hi> of
the heavenly, departed away out of the Earthlyneſſe, into its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
then ſtood the Image which was out of the Divine Subſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
in Death, not in the fierce wrath of the Death of the Anger;
ſo that the heavenly Subſtantiality were become <hi>kindled</hi> in Gods An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
but as a vaniſhed diſappeared Subſtance without ſource or <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>259. For, that which is generated out of the Love, that receiveth
no fierce wrath into it ſelf: for the Lights Subſtantiality is water of
Eternall Life; the water maketh no fierce wrath, but <hi>quencheth</hi> the
Fires fierce wrath.</p>
                  <p>260. If now the heavenly Image or Subſtantiality, in <hi>Adam</hi> were
taken out of the Heavenly <hi>Limbus,</hi> then ſurely its Originall <hi>Mother</hi>
was the Water of the Eternall Life; which originateth from the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
or Deſire of the Light of <hi>God:</hi> as the Water in the Deepe of
this world, from the Meekneſſe of the <hi>Sun's</hi> Light, Through <hi>Venus's
Deſire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:57399:28"/>
261. What fierce wrath or Anger then, would or could come into
the heavenly Subſtantiality of the Holy Body in <hi>Adam?</hi> Alſo that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality
was not at all the Life it ſelf: but the Spirit of God was the
right Life in the <hi>holy</hi> Body.</p>
                  <p>262. But when the Spirit of God departed: then ſtood that Image,
as dead, <hi>without Life;</hi> and the Soul lived, of the Earthly Fire-fewell,
though indeed it is not <hi>quite</hi> Earthly Eſſence, yet that Earthly Eſſence
is generated from the firſt Principle, wherein alſo the Soul ſtandeth.</p>
                  <p>263. Therefore alſo the Soul <hi>luſted</hi> after that ſource or quality,
there was given to the Soul a heavenly Body, of which it ſhould Eate,
and <hi>Not</hi> of BOTH Body's: It ſhould ſet or put its Luſt or longing and
Imagination, <hi>only</hi> into the Heavenly, then would the Soul-Fire have
had the <hi>Earthly Body</hi> in the Dark World, only <hi>hanging</hi>
to it.</p>
                  <p>264. But when it would eate of Both, then came the <hi>Dark Body</hi>
to have power or <hi>ſtrength,</hi> and<note n="†" place="margin">The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Light of this world.</note> Light, and ruled over the <hi>right</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Body: Thus ſinne began in the Soul-Fire; for it became kindled
with the fierce wrathfull Eſſence; and ſo now the Soul Fire burnt, in
that very ſource or quality, and the Divine Light of the Soul, which
ſhone in the meek heavenly Subſtantiality, <hi>extinguiſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>265. For in the Beginning, the right humane Eſſence of the Soul,
was the fewell to its Life's burning, but afterwards the <hi>Earthly Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi>
was it: and that is now the Sinne and the Oppoſite Will, and the
Soul hath no Image or Body, which remaineth Eternally, unleſſe it be
through Chriſt <hi>Regenerated</hi> out of its firſt Subſtantiality, through the
Death of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>266. Therefore it is, that many kindes of <hi>Figures</hi> appeare in the Souls
Image in the inward; all according to what its <hi>deſire</hi> is to a Subſtance,
as, the Image of wilde Beaſts, alſo Serpents and Toads; In whatſover
Eſſence and Will, the Souls-Fire <hi>liveth</hi> and burneth, according to that
Eſſence is alſo, the FIAT in the Will-Spirit, and it Imageth or frameth
ſuch an Image: ſo now, when the outward Body deceaſeth, then ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that Image, thus, in ſuch a forme and ſource or quality.</p>
                  <p>267. In the Time of the Earthly Life, it may <hi>alter its will,</hi> and then
alſo its <hi>Fiat</hi> altereth the <hi>Figure,</hi> but after the Dying of the Body, it hath
nothing more, wherein it can alter its Will; as is to be ſeene by the
Devills.</p>
                  <p>268. Therefore ſayd Chriſt,<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 3. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>To muſt become borne anew, through Water

                  <p>269. That Water, hath not taken ſinne into its Eſſence, for, that <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
be: for that which is out of or from Gods meekneſſe, becometh <hi>not
kindled</hi> in the fierce wrath of God, but is as an impotency or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſhut up in Death, <hi>viz:</hi> in the ſtillneſſe, in the <hi>ſtill</hi> nothing.</p>

or Type of the Limit, which God ſet before them; and <hi>Iſrael</hi> became
in the Sacrifices through the Limit or Mark <hi>ranſomed</hi> from ſinne.</p>
                  <p>290. Iſrael offered Sacrifice with <hi>the bloud of Beaſts,</hi> that, Gods
Imagination looked upon, through the Limit or Mark of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
ſince Man was become <hi>Earthly,</hi> therefore God ſet the Limit or
Mark before himſelf, for a Covenant of Grace, that his Imagination
might <hi>not</hi> enter into the Earthly ſource or quality, and that his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Fire might <hi>not</hi> be <hi>awakened,</hi> with Mans Earthlineſſe and Sinne,
and ſo he devoure them, as was done by <hi>Eliah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>291. The <hi>Circumciſion</hi> of the Jewes was alſo this, that Iſrael muſt
<hi>ſhed its Bloud,</hi> and, that, Gods Imagination looked on, through the
Limit or Mark of his Covenant: For Chriſt ſhould deſtroy Death with
the ſhedding of <hi>his</hi> bloud: It ſhould fall into the Anger of God, <hi>viz:</hi>
into the Souls Fire, and <hi>quench</hi> the <hi>kindled</hi> Fire of God.</p>
                  <p>292. Therefore now God Imaged or repreſented to himſelf in the
Covenant, the <hi>bloud-ſhedding</hi> of Chriſt, and quenched with this <hi>Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,</hi>
the fierce wrath in the Soul: and through THAT, became
Iſrael ſaved, ſuch as with earneſt ſincerity have ſet or put their Will
and Imagination into the Covenant, they have received or concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the <hi>power</hi> of the Limit or Mark in the Covenant, <hi>viz:</hi> in Gods
repreſenting.</p>
                  <p>293. For in God, that which is done and paſt, and that which is
to come is all one; And therefore was the New Regeneration out
of Chriſt reckoned or <hi>imputed</hi> to the Children of the Covenant, <hi>as iif</hi>
they ſtood already in the New Body of Chriſt, as if Chriſt had <hi>alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi>
drowned the Anger with his bloud-ſhedding, and that the Life
were already become Generated out of Death againe.</p>
                  <p>294. For that very Life out of the Limit or Mark, ſtood in Gods
Imagination: and with the Promiſe in Paradiſe it ſet it ſelf therein,
that very Life was Promiſed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that it ſhould be awakened
againe in his ſeed: Not in a ſtrange ſeed, as the Libeller conceiteth,
but in the <hi>ſeed of the Noble Image,</hi> which out of the Heavenly Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality,
out of the Second Principle, was <hi>together</hi> given to <hi>Adam,</hi>
for a Body.</p>
                  <p>295. And yet, with the Entrance of the Soul into the Earthlyneſſe,
was become <hi>ſhut up</hi> in the ſtill Death, as in the Nothing; and that
ſhould againe ſprout out of Death, and therein riſe againe and be
borne, <hi>A New Man,</hi>

Subſtantiality.</p>
                  <p>313. And in the Tincture, was the Chaſt Modeſt <hi>Eye</hi> of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

                  <p>314. And the Holy Spirit is gone forth or proceeded from the Word,

                  <p>315. This very Subſtantiality or Corporeity, as is now mentioned,
was Chriſts heavenly Fleſh and Bloud: For the Noble Tincture ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the <hi>Water</hi> out of the Majeſty, [turne] into Spirituall <hi>Bloud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>316. That very Subſtantiality, which was in the Covenant, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

Principle between the Dark and Light World: it hath the <hi>Center</hi> of

                  <p>320. And the Subſtantiality is out of the <hi>Center</hi> of the Light-world,

                  <p>322. Not that there is a dying or Death therein, but the Fire ſource

been from Eternity, it is unmeaſurable, and unſathomable, it is
every where all over, whereſoever a Man can ſay here is God,
there is alſo the <hi>Divine Subſtantiality,</hi> yet <hi>not</hi> in the Outward World
in the <hi>Third</hi> Principle; but in the Heavenly in the <hi>Second</hi> Principle.</p>

                  <p>333. But the <hi>outward</hi> Kingdome of this World, was not at this time
broken off from <hi>Mary,</hi> that held her ſtill captive, SHEE muſt through
Dying, through <hi>her</hi> Sons Death, enter into the Eternall Life.</p>
                  <p>334. <hi>Her Body</hi> indeed, did not vaniſh or fall away, for it was in the
Midſt, in the Bleſſing, only the <hi>Earthly</hi> ſource or <hi>quality</hi> muſt
break or corrupt in her, and all <hi>Adam's</hi> Children muſt enter through
One and the ſame Entrance into Life, <hi>viz:</hi> through the Dying of
<hi>Chriſt:</hi> when Chriſt quenched the Soul-Fire on the Croſſe in Death,
then alſo <hi>Maryes</hi> Soul-Fire became quenched, that is, rightly kindled
in the Light of the <hi>Majeſty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>335. The outward Body remained to be a Covering before it, ſo
long as it ſtood in the ſource or <hi>quality</hi> of the Stars and Elements;
Through <hi>Dying,</hi> the outward Subſtance of the ſource or quality, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
broken off, and then the Image of God appeareth or <hi>ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>336. Underſtand it right, <hi>Chriſt</hi> had in <hi>Mary</hi> aſſumed all the <hi>Three
Principles</hi> on to himſelf, but in Divine Order or Ordinance, <hi>not</hi> mixed,
as <hi>Adam</hi> did, who introduced the outward Kingdome through the
<hi>Imagination</hi> into the Inward: into the Soul Fire, whence the Light
extinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>337. He had on himſelf, that is on to the Limit or Mark of the <hi>Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Covenant, aſſumed, on to the Living Subſtantiality, the Souls Eſſence,
<hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> Principle, and then the Eſſence of the Image, of the
<hi>Second</hi> Principle; and then the outward Kingdome, the <hi>Third</hi> Principle;
for he ſhould be Lord of All.</p>
                  <p>338. He became after the End of <hi>Four Months,</hi> a living
Soul, which now ſtood in the Image; but the Deity was in the
Image the <hi>Center,</hi> which neither receives Addition or Diminution:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57399:33"/>
the Divine Subſtantiality <hi>alſo,</hi> receives neither Addition nor Diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it becometh neither leſſe nor bigger, only it hath manifeſted
or revealed it ſelf in the Humane Image, and generated it to <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>339. Thus in <hi>Maryes</hi> Conception in her Seed a Living Eſſence aroſe,
<hi>no more</hi> ſhut up in Death, <hi>not</hi> a ſinfull One; for where Gods Light
ſhineth forth, <hi>there</hi> is no ſin within: Sin originateth in that place,
where Gods Light ſhineth <hi>Not;</hi> but where it ſhineth, there is meer
Love and Meckneſſe.</p>
                  <p>340. The Heart of God was the <hi>Ce<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> in the Perſon of Chriſt; the
Eſſences were with the Moving of the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ity, <hi>ſanctified</hi> and Enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
underſtand according to the <hi>Second</hi> Principle: for the Divine
and humane Eſſence became Fleſh and Bloud, and became a Man, One
only Perſon.</p>
                  <p>341. The outward Kingdome <hi>hung</hi> to the inward, but the inward
had now in this Perſon the <hi>Dominion,</hi> the outward was Servant; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſaith the Scripture,<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 2. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>he took upon him the Forme of a</hi> Servant,
that he might releaſe us from Servitude, or Bondage.</p>
                  <p>342. Thus, I <hi>ſay, What</hi> Chriſt is according to our humane Image,
and according to the Soul; therein he is a Creature, like us, <hi>aſſumed</hi>
from us; but what he is according to the Deity, and according to the
Divine Subſtantiality, with that he is <hi>above</hi> Nature, and higher then
the Heaven, and is as to that, <hi>no</hi> Creature, but GOD himſelf.</p>
                  <p>343. But his Divine Subſtance is IN his Creature, <hi>viz:</hi> in the Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<hi>manifeſt:</hi> he is according to the Humanity, ſuch a perſon as <hi>Adam</hi>
was before his Imagination and Fall; he is the ſecond <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>344. The <hi>Firſt</hi> Adam ſhould poſſeſſe the Kingly Seate, but ſeeing
he ſtood not; <hi>therefore</hi> God generated to himſelf another or <hi>ſecond</hi>
Adam out of the <hi>Firſt:</hi> Now if he had <hi>not</hi> been Naturall, then he
had been unlike the firſt Image, alſo he had not been the Sonne of
Man; as the Libeller <hi>ſuppoſeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>345. Had he not had a Naturall Soul, then he had not <hi>in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
had all the Three Principles: What ſhould he then have <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the Hands of his Father</hi> at that preſent when he dyed on the
Croſſe, or what had ſuffered on the Tree of the Croſſe, if he had <hi>not</hi>
been Naturall.</p>
                  <p>346. When he was riſen from the Dead, he ſhewed himſelf to his
Diſciples, and ſaid,<note n="†" place="margin">Luke 24. 39.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold me; a Spirit hath not Fleſh and Bones as yo
ſee me have: Why</hi> then doth the Libeller ſay that it is I that would
make Chriſt according to his holy immaculate humanity, Naturall: I
am <hi>not</hi> the <hi>firſt</hi> that make him Naturall: He is my Brother, and the
ſonne of Man, therefore he muſt <hi>needs</hi> be Naturall, yes <hi>the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells</hi>
are Naturall.</p>
                  <p>347. <hi>But That he ſaith: I have written:</hi> that he became a
Man in the <hi>Wilde;</hi> viz: in the <hi>Outward</hi> Birth;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57399:33"/>
                     <hi>that is NOT true: The Text in my writing ſaith thus: and</hi> he
wreſtled in his humane Body in the Power of the
Light, in the <hi>wilde Nature,</hi> Hath he not, in Hell and on
the Tree of the Croſſe, wreſtled with Gods Anger? Hath he not Dyed and
taken away from our Wilde Nature,<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 15. 55.</note> the ſting of Death?</p>
                  <p>348. The Libeller ſaith; Chriſt is not from <hi>Adam's</hi> Naturall Seed,
if that were true; then he is <hi>not</hi> the ſonne of Man; then hath <hi>not</hi>
God <hi>aſſumed</hi> the humanity Naturally: the Word is indeed become
Fleſh; and is it not become Fleſh in the Humanity? Then let the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller
Tell me how Chriſt came to be the ſonne of Man; or where
remaines our Salvation or Redemption, the <hi>Reſurrection of our Fleſh?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>349. Is Chriſt <hi>not</hi> in our Fleſh; then he will not awaken or raiſeus up: What doth his <hi>Wounds</hi> help me if they are in <hi>ſtronge Fleſh?</hi>
Hath not the blinde Libeller ſeen; that in my whole Book I have
diſtinguiſhed the Earthly and the Heavenly Man? What need he mix
himſelf in the Magick underſtanding, and find <hi>fault</hi> with that of which
he hath no knowledge underſtanding or Ground: let him read my
Book of the becoming Man or <hi>Incarnation</hi> of Chriſt, he would find
more then <hi>he can fathom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>350. But that he will ſay; that Chriſt is become Man in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Seed, and Not in <hi>Adam's</hi> and <hi>Abraham's;</hi> What is that Seed? You
ſee that very Promiſed Seed hath breathed it ſelf into the Humanity,
and God and Man is become ONE Perſon.</p>
                  <p>351. He ſaith, Chriſt, viz: the Eternall Word, hath aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Seed of the pure holy Virgin, Elected to
it from Eternity, which dyed away from Nature,
and was totally bleſſed in God: viz: the fore-mentioned
Seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> Tell me Libeller; <hi>Who</hi> is that Virgin that hath dyed
away from Nature: then ſhe muſt be a Monſter without a Soul, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Fleſh and Bloud, and <hi>No Man-kind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>352. What need God aſſume to himſelf heavenly Seed into his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance?
was not his Subſtance <hi>for certain</hi> on him from Eternity: What
doth that help us? But that he is Entered into our humanity and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened
or raiſed up, our in Death incloſed Seed, and make it
Living againe; <hi>that I rejoyce at,</hi> that I may truly ſay; that my Fleſh
<note n="†" place="margin">Luk. 22. 69.</note>
                     <hi>ſuteth at the Right hand, in the Power of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>353. If Chriſt hath aſſumed to himſelf, <hi>any other</hi> Seed then my <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
Man is, <hi>how then</hi> can my inward Man Eat his Fleſh and Drink
his Bloud?</p>
                  <p>354. Sir Libeller, <hi>Erre not, God will not ſuffer himſelf</hi> nor his children
<hi>to be mocked:</hi> we ſuppoſe eaſily, that you are altogether blind ſtill
in the Myſtery of God; you know <hi>nothing</hi> of the inward Man; much
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57399:34"/>
                     <hi>leſſe</hi> of the New Regeneration: learne firſt rightly to underſtand the
Principles; and the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature, before you Judge; you will
needs be one taught of God or Learned in God, and yet know not
one Letter in THAT Schoole.</p>
                  <p>355. By, Nature, you underſtand, <hi>only,</hi> the outward Kingdome:
what kinde of Nature then hath the <hi>Soul?</hi> I ſuppoſe here your Art
will know nothing of it: you know Nothing of the inward Man,
which is the <hi>ſimilitude</hi> of God: and yet will Judge: you underſtand
not what God is: and yet you will Judge Gods Children: you are
juſtly to be condemned in <hi>this.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>356. You bring places of Scripture, and underſtand <hi>them not;</hi> and
beſides you expound my ſence and Mind altogether falſly: Who
hath called you, that <hi>you</hi> ſhould explaine my obſcure deep hidden
Writing? I had written as a young child in the Myſtery of God;
when I was firſt come into that Schoole, and hung ſtill to the A. B. C:
come you or any other to <hi>this</hi> Dance, and you will well ſee, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you can be <hi>inſtantly a Doctor</hi> or no.</p>
                  <p>357. Such a <hi>fooliſh underſtanding</hi> as you impute to me, I would ſcarce
look for in a Cow: have a care and conſider, how you will be able
to anſwer it in the preſence of God: If your <hi>Fiction,</hi> ſhould prevaile,
then inſtantly would <hi>another Antichriſt</hi> be generated or born.</p>
                  <p>358. You come marching on with a <hi>twofold</hi> Seed in <hi>Adam,</hi> one muſt
be <hi>Chriſts</hi> Seed and the other Adams <hi>Naturall</hi> Seed, and found the
<hi>Election</hi> of God upon it; but you look upon this Myſtery, as a Cow
looketh upon a New Barne Door; you underſtand nothing of it;
you can <hi>not</hi> explaine, and ſet it downe with any ground, what the
Seed of the Noble Image is, and yet you will Judge.</p>
                  <p>359. Indeed, thou layeſt a <hi>ſnare</hi> before Mens Souls, eſpecially the
dejected ſad ſorrowfull Tempted Souls, ſo that many a one thinketh
thus, with himſelf, ſaying <hi>who knowes</hi> whether I be begotten or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
out of a right Seed, out of Chriſt; eſpecially when he feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Aſſaults of Temptation: then he ſhould ſeek comfort, in <hi>this</hi>
Libell.</p>
                  <p>360. You ſay, the Gracious <hi>Election</hi> is a great Comfort to the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Chriſt, when they <hi>feele</hi> Gods Grace in them; <hi>viz:</hi> the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Seed; but where ſhall he reſt that is Aſſaulted and Tempted by
the <hi>Devill?</hi> he may well in <hi>your</hi> writings deſpaire; he would think
continually, he were out of or from <hi>Adam's</hi> Seed, and that God will
none of him.</p>
                  <p>361. <hi>If you will ſpeak ſo of the Grace-Election, then you muſt</hi> not
leave out <hi>the Love of God, which willeth not the Evill; you ſhould</hi>
joyne <hi>with it that which Chriſt ſaith,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 17. 5, 6.</note> Father, the Men were thine, and
thou haſt given them to Me,<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 10. 28.</note> and I give them the Eternall Life: <hi>Alſo</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 17. 24.</note>Father, I will that thoſe whom thou haſt given Me, be where I am:
Alſo;<note n="†" place="margin">Luk. 5. 32.</note> I am come to call the ſinners to repentance, and not the Righteous;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57399:34"/>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 15. 7.</note>there is in Heaven among the Angells of God, more Joy at one ſinner that

that he turne and live.</p>
                  <p>362. If you will prove any thing with <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> with <hi>Iſsac</hi> and
<hi>Iſhmael,</hi> alſo with <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> then learne firſt to underſtand the

Nature, learne firſt to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Eternall</hi> Nature, from the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
inceptive Nature; elſe you will but lay a ſnare upon the Bodyes
and Souls of your Diſciples or Schollers, and will but tumble or Grope
in the Dark in meere doubting.</p>
                  <p>363. You will build high, and yet a Man can find <hi>no</hi> ſufficient
ground in all your writing: It is as to the Myſtery but a fighting with
a ſhaddow: Tell me, if you be a Maſter, and have an enlightened
Mind and Thoughts, as you ſuppoſe; What are the <hi>Two</hi> Seeds in
<hi>Adam,</hi> out of <hi>one</hi> of which <hi>Cain,</hi> out of the other <hi>Abel</hi> is generated or
borne: Is that the Predeſtinate Purpoſe of God, as you conceit it?
then demonſtrate it.</p>
                  <p>364. You muſt underſtand the <hi>Birth</hi> or Geniture, of the Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
if you will Judge thereof; <hi>alſo,</hi> the underſtanding of the <hi>Dark</hi>
World; alſo of the fierce <hi>Wrath,</hi> and of the <hi>Love</hi> of God, what God
is in Love and Anger; what a Devill or an Angel is, and how he came
to be a Devill.</p>
                  <p>365. Alſo, you muſt underſtand the Myſterie of the <hi>Divine</hi> wiſdome;
Eſpecially you muſt underſtand, how the Deare <hi>Name</hi> of God <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateth</hi>
from Eternity; How the <hi>Nothing</hi> becometh introduced into Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſo that out of the Nothing, a ſource or <hi>quality</hi> cometh to be;
If you underſtand not THESE things, then ſtay with your conceits
at home; read my Book of the <hi>Threefold Life of Man:</hi> and you will
ſee with other Eyes.</p>
                  <p>366. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>You muſt be borne anew; through Water and the Holy
Spirit, elſe you cannot ſee the Kingdome of God:</hi> He ſaith, YOU, not a
ſtranger, YOUR SELF!</p>
                  <p>367. There doth not come <hi>another</hi> ſtrange Creature into us when
we become born out of Chriſt; but, <hi>when</hi> we put our whole deſire, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, into the becoming Man or Incarnation of Chriſt, into his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
and Dying: and become ſorry for our ſinnes and deſire Gods
Mercy in Chriſt; <hi>then</hi> our Souls Will-Spirit goeth forth from ſinne
and Evill or Malice, and entereth into the becoming Man or <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of Chriſt; <hi>viz:</hi> into the Heavenly Subſtantiality, which is<note n="*" place="margin">NOTE.</note> greater
then all: and there the Will-Spirit cometh before the <hi>Center,</hi> viz: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Heart of God.</p>
                  <p>368. That Heart of God is <hi>deſirous</hi> of the Humanity, and that graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
with its deſire into the Will-Spirit, after the Humanity, and thus
the Will-Spirit receiveth the Power of the <hi>Center,</hi> viz: a <hi>Sparkle</hi> of the
Divine Power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:57399:35"/>
369. And that Sparkle, hath on it ſelf the Divine Subſtantiality, <hi>viz:</hi>
the Water of the Eternall Life, out of the <hi>Majeſty</hi> of God, and <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi>
the Wiſdome with the Heavenly <hi>Tincture:</hi> this the Will-Spirit which
is become generated out of the Soul, bringeth <hi>againe</hi> with great Joy,
into the Souls-Fire.</p>
                  <p>370. And when the Soul-Fire, taſteth the ſweet Love and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in it ſelf, in its own Eſſence, then the <hi>Eſſence</hi> is ſo very vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently
terrified, that it appeareth overcome, as it were dead, and
loſeth its <hi>Fiery</hi> right, and the Fiery Eſſence falleth into the Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Love, <hi>viz:</hi> into the <hi>Liberty</hi> of God, without beſides or
beyond Nature, and yeeldeth it ſelf captive to the Meekneſſe, <hi>viz:</hi> to
the Lights property; and is as if it were of the Fiery property, and
yet were not of it: this is a terrour of Great Joy, and the Aſpect of
God, in the Divine Power, whence Body and Soul doe tremble for
Joy.</p>
                  <p>371. For thus the Souliſh Fire becometh put out of, the Earneſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
<hi>paine</hi> of the fierce wrath of God, of the Eternall Fires Eſſence and
property, into another ſource or quality: <hi>viz:</hi> into a <hi>Love-Deſire;</hi> for
the Light of God kindleth it ſelf in the Souls-Fire; for when the
Meekneſſe and Love Deſire cometh into the <hi>Magick</hi> Souls-Fire, then
the Love and Meekneſſe <hi>feeleth</hi> the Great Life, out of the Fathers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>372. For, the Meekneſſe is a <hi>Sinking</hi> downe, it is the Water-Spirit,
and without the Great Life, is as it were dead, in compariſon of the
Fire, but when it cometh into the Fire, it becometh, <hi>as vehemently</hi> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
as the Fire in it, and the terrour is the kindling of its Life and
of the Light.</p>
                  <p>373. Seeing then the Soul in the beginning of its Creation, was
cloathed and <hi>adorned</hi> with this Heavenly Subſtantiality; and it was the
Souls right <hi>inward Body,</hi> and that the Soul, in <hi>Adam</hi> is gone forth, with
its Imagination, away from this Subſtantiality; whence that Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
is againe become <hi>ſhut up</hi> in Death, <hi>viz:</hi> in the ſtill Nothing.</p>
                  <p>374. And it, the Soul, is entered with its Imagination into the <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
Kingdome, <hi>viz:</hi> into the Subſtantiality of its Root: and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
that very firſt Image, which became ſhut up in Death, <hi>viz:</hi> in the
inability <hi>without the Life,</hi> yet <hi>hangeth</hi> to the Soul: but without its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
or underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>375. Therefore now, when the Light of the Soul becometh kindled
againe, and the heavenly Subſtantiality out of Gods Majeſty recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
the Life: <hi>viz;</hi> the Light in the Soul; then the <hi>dead</hi> Subſtantiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
becometh Living againe in the Lights power; and becometh, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the now new <hi>introduced</hi> Subſtantiality, one Subſtantiality,
one ſpirituall Body, for it is of one only Eſſence, and here Death
riſeth up in Chriſt, here God and the Inward Man become one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>376. Underſtand it aright: This new Light-Life, is <hi>Chriſt:</hi> He firſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57399:35"/>
introduced it againe into the Soul, and our right humanity, ſo that
God and Man is ONE: Now we muſt follow after God, we muſt put
<hi>our</hi> Imagination into him: for he hath put <hi>his</hi> into Us, and then we
become impregnate with the Saviour; we become new-borne in his
Limit or Mark, that God ſet in Paradiſe; wherein, he is become Man;
Death riſeth up again in that very <hi>Limit</hi> or Mark: we muſt be true
<hi>Members</hi> of Chriſt, if we would ſee God.</p>
                  <p>377. When the Water, or the Water-ſource or quality out of the
Meekneſſe of God, cometh into the Souls-Fire, ſo that the Light kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
it ſelf, then is the Noble <hi>Tincture</hi> already generated out of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the Fire, which is the Glance or Luſtre and <hi>Ornament</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
as a Paradiſicall Delight or Pleaſantneſſe, in which the Subſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of God ſhineth or appeareth; and therein the Holy Spirit, and
in the Spirit, the <hi>Divine Center,</hi> viz: the Power of Heart of God, and
in the Heart of God the <hi>Myſterie,</hi> viz: the Principle or the Father;
<hi>viz:</hi> the Fire-World; and in the Fire-World, the <hi>Dark World;</hi> and in
the Dark World this outward World, together with the Starres and
Elements.</p>
                  <p>378. Thus ALL goeth out of ONE fountain-Spring, but the Heart
of God is the <hi>Center</hi> of All Subſtances, or of Every thing: it is all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall,
and in the Magick-Deſire ſtandeth the <hi>Subſtance</hi> according to
<hi>each</hi> Worlds property, and according to the deſire of each of them;
for the Deſire maketh Subſtance, according to the <hi>Deſires property,</hi>
therefore, is the Fire the ſtrongeſt, and the Light the Mightieſt in the
Power; the Fire giveth Life, and the Light giveth power, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                  <p>379. Underſtand it aright; The Dark World is the <hi>Center</hi> of this
outward World; The Dark World hath the formes to Nature, <hi>viz:</hi>
the <hi>Great</hi> Magick Deſire; wherein the ſource or Torment and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh</hi>
generateth it ſelf; It is the wheele to the Fire-Life, with its
Formes, and hath in it ſelf, the ſtrong <hi>Magia</hi> of the Deſire: It labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in its own forme till to the Fire; and there its Principle<note n="*" place="margin">Schleuſſet ſich.</note> ſhuts up
it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>380. For, <hi>in the Fire,</hi> exiſteth the great Life, and another ſource or
quality, and alſo another Principle, <hi>viz:</hi> the Light, with the quality
or ſource of Meekneſſe: whereas <hi>in</hi> the Dark World, there is only
Anguiſh and a meere hunger Deſire; The Light holdeth the Dark
World <hi>captive:</hi> In theſe TWO now ſtandeth the <hi>Drawing</hi> to Good
and to Evill: my Sir Libeller.</p>
                  <p>381. The Light or the <hi>Power</hi> of the Light is a deſire; and willeth to
have the Noble Image according to Gods ſimilitude; for it is created
to the Light World: ſo alſo the Dark World, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Deſiring</hi> of the
fierce Wrath, willeth to have it: for Man hath all the <hi>Three</hi> Worlds
in himſelf, and there is a great Strife in Man: to which of theſe now
he uniteth or giveth up himſelf with his Deſire and Willing, that get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57399:36"/>
the <hi>Dominion</hi> in him; as the Apoſtle ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 6. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>To which you give
your ſelf in Obedience, you are ſervant of that; either of ſinne unto Death,
or of Obedience unto Righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>382. <hi>Each</hi> world ſtandeth hidden in the other; for Each dwelleth
only and barely in it ſelf, neither poſſeſſeth the other in the fource
or <hi>quality</hi> thereof; as you ſee it in Light and Darkneſſe, how the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
dwelleth in the Light, and is not manifeſt in the <hi>ſhining</hi> of the
Light: but if the Light departeth or Extinguiſheth, then the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
becometh manifeſt.</p>
                  <p>383. Thus you ſee alſo, the difference of the ſource or quality, how
one ſource or quality mixeth <hi>not</hi> with the other; by the Fire and
Light; The Light dwelleth in the Fire, and yet hath not the Fires
ſource or quality, but a meek amiable one: and Herein ſticketh the
Great Myſtery, <hi>Myſterium Magnum:</hi> My Sir Libeller, ſeek it, and then
you will find it.</p>
                  <p>384. In this Myſterie ſeek the TWO ſort of Seeds and Wills, and
leave <hi>free-will</hi> to Man: elſe you are the Dark Worlds Advocate; which
World ſoever in Man, gets the <hi>upper</hi> Dominion, that extracts or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
Seed out of its own Eſſence; that beareth fruit and worketh,
the other ſtands hidden, be it the Heavenly or the Helliſh.</p>
                  <p>385. When <hi>Adam's</hi> Soul went ſorth away from the Divine World out
of Paradiſe into the Outward World, then the Soul wrought or
boar fruit to Death in the Dark World: But when it apprehended the
Curſher of the Serpent, in the <hi>Limit</hi> or Mark of the Covenant, <hi>then</hi> it
wrought or boare fruit to Life againe.</p>
                  <p>386. But being his Noble Image, without the becoming Man or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
of Chriſt, <hi>could</hi> not riſe up our of the ſtill Death, therefore
<hi>both</hi> Dominions remained qualifying or operating in him; <hi>viz;</hi> the
Helliſh and the Heavenly, and are ſtanding the whole Time, in ſtrife
one with another, about the <hi>Image;</hi> Each hath its <hi>Fiat</hi> in it ſelf, and
many a Branch is become rent off from this Tree.</p>
                  <p>387. And here ſeek <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> alſo <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſou, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael;</hi>

                  <p>389. The <hi>Poſſibility</hi> is in ALL Men, but<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 9. 16.</note> in Gods <hi>Mercy,</hi>

he muſt be Dead, underſtand with the outward Reaſon, and then
God in Chriſt liveth in Him.</p>
                  <p>390. He ſhould <hi>not</hi> feigne to himſelf wayes to the Kingdome of

                  </p>
                  <p>391. When Man converteth, and goeth forth from ſinne, then he
becometh IN Gods Mercy, <hi>Elected</hi> to be a Child of God: then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

                  </p>
                  <p>392. Now he draweth not the wicked Will, THAT, the Devill and
the Dark world draweth; only Man <hi>hath</hi> Free will, if he caſt his
Will into Righteouſneſſe into God, then the Spirit of God compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth

and <hi>then</hi> beginneth the <hi>Drawing of the Father</hi> to the Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>393. God hardeneth no Man, but the Dark world in the Devils
Imagination and <hi>Inchantment,</hi> they harden Man, <hi>viz;</hi> the Souls-Fire,
they are a Door <hi>ſhut</hi> againſt the Light.</p>
                  <p>394. Though indeed the Scripture ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 9. 18.</note>

                  <p>395. Gods hardening is, when he <hi>letteth</hi> one run on whither he

Heart: <hi>who</hi> will Judge him? Thou Moate-Judger, ſtay thou at home.</p>
               <p>422. When I in that Place ſpeak of the Tree of<note n="*" place="margin">Or Tree of Life.</note> vegetation, <hi>viz:</hi> of
the <hi>ſweet</hi> Tree; then I underſtand or meane <hi>not</hi> the will of the Fleſh,
but the Dominion of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> I alſo ſpeak not of the <hi>Corpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>
and inceptive or beginning Birth, but of the <hi>Spirituall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>423. The ſweet Tree is <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> as is formerly mentioned at
Large, underſtand, it is the <hi>heavenly</hi> Subſtantiality, which the Word or
Heart of God brought along with it; into the Eſſence of <hi>Mary,</hi> which
became Man in <hi>Mary,</hi> that ſweet Tree of the Divine Subſtantiality <hi>is
greater then all;</hi> and moveth in the ſecond Principle, over US ALL.</p>
               <p>424. My whole meaning Aimes at this, and though thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeſt
it not, yet I know it, and ſay with aſſured Truth, that <hi>many</hi>
a Heathen, Turk, and Infant, hath eaten of <hi>this</hi> Tree in Gods <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
and though he hath not knowne it plainly by <hi>Name,</hi> that which
the outward Man knoweth not, that the inward Man knoweth, yea
the <hi>Outlandiſh</hi> People have even <hi>Adames</hi> Body and Soul as well as we.</p>
               <p>425. <hi>Hearken Libeller: what ſaith</hi> Paul,<note n="†" place="margin">Rom. 2. II.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>to the</hi> 16? There

JESUS CHRIST, according to my Goſpel.</p>
               <p>426. Why then doth the Libeller reject <hi>this</hi> which I have written,
that the Law of Nature is <hi>written</hi> in Mans heart, and Every one <hi>by
Nature</hi> Knoweth well, and his Conſcience witneſſeth to him, that he
ſhould doe <hi>Right:</hi> now if there were a Stranger, who knew Nothing
of Chriſt, and did from his <hi>whole Soul,</hi> chriſtian works, in hope of the
Divine Wages; Wilt thou condemne him?</p>
               <p>427. Doeſt thou not underſtand, that <hi>they ſhall be judged by</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
<hi>which hear</hi> the Goſpel <hi>and do it not;</hi> and they which hear it <hi>not</hi>
and do <hi>Evill,</hi> ſhall be ſo <hi>too:</hi> and they which heard not Chriſt Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,

ſtiffe necked Chriſtians, which only bear the <hi>Name</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>428. If thou <hi>canſt,</hi> then blame Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to his face, as thou doeſt
me; Thou unintelligent fierce wrathfull envious Libeller; Thou Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
me and Condemneſt me, <hi>Contrary</hi> to the Commandment of Chriſt,
who ſaith;<note n="†" place="margin">Luk. 6. 37.</note>

               <p>429. What need you ſpread abroad ſuch a reproachfull Libel among
the People, and Judge my written unprinted Writings, which I wrote
only for a Memoriall to <hi>my ſelf,</hi> which are come to Light <hi>without</hi> my
will; and to condemn me in ſuch a vaine frivolous and altogether
Diabolicall manner.</p>
               <p>430. Thou <hi>Moate</hi>-Judger; was this commanded thee it was not done
in reſpect of the Authour of the Book; but that thou mighteſt make
ſhew of thy fine <hi>high underſtanding</hi> Thoughts, what a <hi>Maſter</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

                  <hi>Babel</hi>
with an unchriſtain Mind, go on ſo, and thou wilt be found, a very
faithfull Labourer to our Lord God in his Vineyard, will you not
think you?</p>
               <p>431. Thou haſt in thy diſgracefull Libel ſet it down thy ſelf, that
men ſhould condemn <hi>none,</hi> but it is free for THEE <hi>only,</hi> what thou
forbiddeſt to another, THOU only mayſt Judge that which is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</p>
               <p>432. Had I known that my Book ſhould have been read, likely it
had been written <hi>clearlier,</hi> with plain words, though it is clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
but thou art blind: The Moat or <hi>Splinter</hi> of the Thorne of
<hi>Pride,</hi> to ſhew himſelf to his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> like <hi>Cain,</hi> ſticketh in <hi>thy
Eyes.</hi>

                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:57399:39"/>
433. But I tell thee, that thy Book the Libel, affordeth a good Root
for a <hi>New Antichriſt;</hi> I underſtand therein very <hi>new</hi> Things, which I
ſuppoſe, to run quite contrary to the Holy Scripture: Eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Becoming Man or <hi>Incarnation</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and concerning
<hi>his</hi> Mother <hi>Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>434. I believe, if men did <hi>not</hi> Read the Libel, it would be more
conducing to their happineſſe, then for any to grope far after your
new conceits, which are <hi>contrary</hi> to the Ground of the Scripture; it
hath ſuch an aſpect, that it filleth the <hi>Eyes</hi> of the People, but <hi>not</hi> of
thoſe that underſtand aright, they do <hi>not all</hi> account thee a Maſter
for it, it is even called <hi>Babel,</hi> and an untirnely or abortive unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<hi>Libel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>435. Is this thy Chriſtian Heart, that thou <hi>judgeſt</hi> and condemneſt
a zealous Man, who is zealous after Salvation: and if I <hi>did</hi> indeed
<hi>erre</hi> in my zeal, and yet in a right heart and ſincere meaning, and
that, really led with Ignorance and ſimplicity: <hi>ſhouldeſt</hi> thou condemn
Me? Doeſt thou not <hi>Obſerve</hi> what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the zealous Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
as above-mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>436. Art thou a Maſter and a Chriſtian, why doeſt thou not <hi>firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct</hi> me,
and teach me what is better; Doeſt thou not know me, I
think it is <hi>not hidden</hi> to thee who I am, <hi>viz: a ſimple</hi> Man, and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned:</hi>
Art thou highly learned, expert, and skilfull, ſhouldſt thou
then deal ſo Tyrannically with me, as to <hi>caſt</hi> me to the Devill?</p>
               <p>437. Where is thy Chriſtian Heart? ſhew it me <hi>in thy</hi> Libel?
ſhouldeſt thou condemn a Simple Man? I would have friendly <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerred</hi>
with thee, and given thee a good account of my doings, if
thou hadſt done as <hi>befits</hi> a Chriſtian, with <hi>friendly</hi> Information.</p>
               <p>438. But thy high puſt up Mind <hi>would</hi> not; now I have anſwered
to it; it deſerves no better; ſince thou proclaimeſt me a Devill, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
thee a Lyar, for I am a <hi>Child of God,</hi> and am zealous day and
night after my God, with Sapplication to his <hi>Mercy</hi> for Chriſts ſake,
and ſtedfaſtly believe, that I am a Child of God, and Member of Chriſts
<hi>Body:</hi> I am alſo very certain in the power of the Holy Spirit, that he
will preſerve my <hi>Depoſited</hi> Treaſure, <hi>viz:</hi> the Noble Pearly Jewel in
Chriſt, till <hi>that</hi> Day.</p>
               <p>439. Thou proud Phariſee, thou ſhalt not take away the Noble Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
of <hi>Victory</hi> from me, which my Saviour Chriſt hath ſet upon me;
but if thou <hi>deſireſt</hi> to take it away from me, <hi>have a care</hi> what thou
doeſt, and where thou abideſt, that the Anger of God do not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voure</hi>
thee.</p>
               <p>440. I would as a Chriſtian have thee warned, to <hi>abſtain</hi> from ſuch
reproaching, and ſhamefull condemning: for the kingdome of God,
<hi>conſiſteth not</hi> is knowing much, but in an Earneſt ſincere obedient
<hi>humble</hi> Mind and Will, in the preſence of God, that we be Chriſtains
<hi>in</hi> the <hi>Deed,</hi> and not with the Mouth only.</p>
               <p>441. A Chriſtian hath no ſtrife but only <hi>againſt</hi> HIMSELF, againſt

                  <hi>Vengoance is mine, I will repay it,</hi> we

one but judge himſelf, and turn to God. The Strife is alwayes about
the <hi>Shell;</hi> and the <hi>Kernell</hi> which belongeth to the Soul, men let that
lye.</p>
               <p>442. Hath any Learned ſomwhat, let him uſe it to the Honour of
God, and the profit of his Brother; he ſhould <hi>not</hi> deſpiſe any: God
hath regenerated us in his Love, <hi>without</hi> all our knowledge or deſert,
through his Heart, <hi>viz;</hi> his great <hi>Mercy;</hi> when as formerly we
were all of us blind, and knew nothing of his bringing us back again;
we were<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 3. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>all under ſinne:</hi> and he hath beſtowed on us the childſhip
out of Grace:<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 22.</note> ſhall we then out ſelves judge one another.</p>
               <p>443. Or, can we all ſpeak with one and the ſame Tongue? <hi>There
are,</hi> you know, <hi>many Gifts,</hi> and <hi>but One</hi> only <hi>Spirit,</hi> which giveth them,
as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; Shall we then call <hi>that</hi> very Spirit a Devill, which

               </p>
               <p>444. Thou draweſt the Judgement of God wilfully upon thy ſelf,
and makeſt the people <hi>the worſe,</hi> that look upon thy Reproaching, ſo
that they alſo become ſlanderers from <hi>your</hi> Mouth, whereas otherwiſe
they would be quiet, that Sinne might be brought forth with Sinne, and

<note n="†" place="margin">Same Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</note>
                  <hi>Maſſe</hi> or Lump, they are all ſhut up <hi>under

then the other: but they are diſtinguiſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Spirit:</hi> and the Children of the Light
generated from or out of HIM: whom he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth
out of the Naturall Darkneſſe; and <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
their Darkneſſe Light;</hi> But the Children of

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57399:40"/>
their Light go out in the Midſt of the Darkneſſe;
for he loved</hi> Jacob, <hi>and hated</hi> Eſau.</p>
               <p>446. Hearken Libeller; <hi>why</hi> doeſt thou boyle the Broth in thy Mouth,
and telleſt not all <hi>freely</hi> forth, as it ſitteth in thy heart; you have it
within you, I would have you <hi>fully</hi> give it forth: What mean you by
the <hi>Two</hi> ſorts of <hi>Spirits</hi> from the Mothers Body or Womb; are there
two ſorts of <hi>Souls</hi> generated or born? one out of God; the other out
of the Fleſh, as thou <hi>ſuppoſeſt:</hi> O thou blind Reaſon, what doſt thou
Teach? <hi>Wilt</hi> thou judge? when thou thy ſelf underſtandeſt it <hi>not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>447. Of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> no <hi>Soul</hi> becometh Generated, but Soul of Soul,
and Fleſh of Fleſh; we are from <hi>Adam</hi> all extracted or begotten of one
Soul and Spirit: and no other; <hi>Adam</hi> is the Tree, we are the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
we ſtand all in that Tree as to the Root, and he hath <hi>deſtroyed</hi> us
<hi>all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>448. Elſe, if it were ſo, that one Man did receive in the Mothers
Body or <hi>Womb,</hi> an <hi>Earthly</hi> Spirit, and the other, one out of or <hi>from
God,</hi> then were he which is Generated or born out of or from God,
<hi>not</hi> guilty of Adams fall; alſo he were <hi>no Sinner</hi> from the Mothers womb,
and the other from the Fleſh, were from the Mothers womb, <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:</hi>
as he finely Court-like applyes it to <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau:</hi> this is his

broth in the Mouth.</p>
               <p>449. For what ſhould God ſuffer, ſo long a while, that there is teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and <hi>Preaching to the Damned;</hi> or what would it be profitable <hi>to the
totally perfect?</hi> Is the Spirit, from the Mothers womb, of God, and hath
it Gods Light PERFECT; then it is without Sinne, and <hi>needs no</hi> Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But the Scripture ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 3. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>They are all Sinners, and come ſhort of the

               <p>450. ANd the Libeller ſaith further; Who then <hi>dare</hi> ſay that
this is done without the command of the

out of the <hi>Mouth</hi> of the Moſt High; Hath <hi>not a</hi>

               </p>

which belongeth to the <hi>Soul,</hi> then be ſilent about the <hi>Election</hi> ſtill;
thou underſtandeſt nothing thereof.</p>
               <p>454. Thou <hi>ſuppoſeſt</hi> God hardeneth the Soul, and it is <hi>not</hi> true; the

by the dark Center of Nature, from the fierce wrathfull Formes to
Nature.</p>
               <p>455. For the Principles ſtand in a Continuall Wreſtiling, as the Fire
in the <hi>ſource</hi> or<note n="†" place="margin">Or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> quality; As it hath ſo happened to <hi>Lucifer,</hi> that he

               </p>
               <p>456. The <hi>Light World,</hi> which is God himſelf, hath no deſire to Evill
or deſtruction: there is not the <hi>leaſt</hi> ſparkle in God, that deſireth the
Evill; God calleth himſelf God, according to the <hi>Light,</hi> according to
the <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> according to the Fire-ſource or quality, much <hi>leſſe</hi>
according to the Dark World.</p>
               <p>457. The Fire-ſource or quality, is fierce wrathfulneſſe, and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
all whatſoever cometh into it, and the Dark World is a meere
fierce wrathfull <hi>hunger:</hi> and the Light World is a meere Love, <hi>Man
hath</hi> all the Three in the <hi>Center.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>458. When the Life becometh kindled, then is in the <hi>Center</hi> the
Strife in the Formes to Nature; <hi>there</hi> many a Soul becometh appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

<hi>fault.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>460. The Souls Spirit <hi>knew</hi> indeed very well, where its home

that the Doore of Grace is <hi>not yet</hi> barred up to the poor Soul, and
though the Devill <hi>had it on his chains,</hi> and would go away with it,
if it be <hi>yet</hi> in Fleſh and Bloud, in this world, there is <hi>remedy</hi>
for it, if it bewaile the Evill, and <hi>Convert,</hi> God forſaketh it
NOT.</p>
               <p>465. He hath Created but ONE <hi>only Soul;</hi> not to perdition but
to Life, to his Honour and Glory; this he requireth alſo from all
Men, and Man ſhall give an account, how hath uſed it; for it
is his <hi>Nobleſt</hi> Jewel.</p>
               <p>466. And according to the Soul and its Image, he is <hi>Gods Child;</hi>
and according to the Spirit and Body of this World, he is become a
<hi>Beaſt,</hi> according to the ſource and quality of the Starres and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
As in the Book of <hi>The Threefold Life</hi> is expreſſed largely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough:
The Reader himſelf may ſeek <hi>there,</hi> he will find the Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Election
a little otherwiſe, and the Mark <hi>neerer,</hi> then in this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel.</p>
               <p>467. I may not here repeat the Deep Myſterie with ſo large a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe:
The frivolous ſcornfull diſcourſe in this Libel, alſo, <hi>is not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
of it; a Man ſhould not caſt Pearls before ſwine; the Libeller
hath made a heap of ſcornfull <hi>expreſſions,</hi> to trim his conceit; but all
that which is not very neceſſary, <hi>I count</hi> not worth an anſwer.</p>

               </p>

               <p>486. My Libeller; Open thou thy Eyes, and obſerve, that I. by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Nature, out of which the Angells are Created, <hi>underſtand, not</hi>
the <hi>Divine</hi> Principle: can you not ſee a ſimilitude of it, in Fire
and Light? Thou ſeeſt, thy ſelf, very well, that the <hi>Fire</hi> is Nature,
and <hi>not</hi> the <hi>Light:</hi> out of the Light can nothing be created; only out
of the Subſtantiality, <hi>viz:</hi> out of the Meekneſſe, can a thing be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that, is <hi>Subſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>487. Yet now a <hi>living Spirit</hi> cannot be made out of Subſtance, the
Life is not Subſtance, but a <hi>deſire</hi> of Subſtance.</p>
               <p>488. A Spirit, as Angells and Souls are, is out of the <hi>Magia</hi> or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
of the Fire-ſource or quality, proceeded out of the Formes to
Nature, <hi>viz:</hi> out of the <hi>Center:</hi> for Nothing is Eternall, unleſſe it be
proceeded out of the <hi>Center</hi> of the Eternall <hi>property.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>489. The <hi>Center</hi> is a Deſire to the Manifeſtation of the Abyſſe in a

Myſtery of the Eternall Divine Subſtance.</p>
               <p>490. The Light hath another <hi>Center:</hi> God is underſtood or meant,

Deſire is the <hi>Center</hi> of the Fire; and in the Fire, is the Liberty,
<hi>viz:</hi> the Nothing, <hi>manifeſt;</hi> ſpoken after a Creaturely Manner.</p>
               <p>491. God is in reſpect of the Creature, as a Nothing: and yet he is
indeed ALL: in the Fire, his Majeſty becometh <hi>manifeſt:</hi> in the Fire
is the finding of the Nothing: God himſelf findeth himſelf from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

God; The <hi>Nature</hi> becometh born or Generated in the Will of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
Nothing.</p>
               <p>492. There is but ONE only Will, which is the ABYSSE, which
is deſirous of the foundation or Ground; <hi>viz:</hi> of the Manifeſtation or

deſirous Wills <hi>viz:</hi> the Lights and the Fires.</p>
               <p>496. The Light is a deſire of <hi>Love,</hi> Meekneſſe, and Subſtantiality,
and that is in the Eternity called <hi>God:</hi> The Light is the Majeſty, the
Lights deſire is the Other or ſecond <hi>Center,</hi> or the Heart of God: the
Subſtantiality is Gods Subſtance; it is the Water ſource or quality, or
the Spirit of the Eternall Joys Life.</p>
               <p>497. And the <hi>Fire</hi> maketh in the Water-ſource or quality, the <hi>Tincture,</hi>
or Life, ſo that Gods Subſtantiality is a <hi>Life:</hi> That very Lights Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality,
is the Words or Hearts <hi>Cerporeity,</hi> wherein the Great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of the Will of the Abyſſe, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> becometh Manifeſt.</p>
               <p>498. And the <hi>Fire</hi> is another Principle then the Light, it hath a fierce
wrathfull, ſtinging, conſuming, Deſire, climing up in Might and Pomp;
it willeth to <hi>conſume</hi> and ſwallow up all into it ſelf, it is a cauſe of the
Covetouſneſſe, its Bitterneſſe is a Cauſe of the Envy, for it is the <hi>ſting</hi>
of Death and Anger.</p>
               <p>499. And here goe back into the Formes to Fire, and then thou
wilt find the Dark World, and the helliſh fierce Wrath, and in the
<hi>Fire,</hi> GODS <hi>Anger,</hi> which the <hi>Light,</hi> viz: his Heart
holdeth captive in the <hi>Love</hi>-Source or Quality, and allayeth or
meekeneth the Fires fierce-Wrath.</p>
               <p>500. For, the <hi>Water of the Eternall Life,</hi> generated or born out of the
Meekneſſe, <hi>viz:</hi> Gods Subſtantiality, maketh out of the <hi>Divine Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource</hi>
or quality, another ſource or quality, <hi>viz:</hi> the climibing up of
the Divine Joys Kingdome: The Fire-ſource or quality, muſt only be
<hi>a cauſe</hi> of the Life and of the Light, as alſo of the Spirit and of the
Joys Kingdome.</p>
               <p>501. And heare the Name <hi>God</hi> ſevereth it ſelf in the <hi>Trinity;</hi> viz: In
the <hi>Firſt Center</hi> to Nature, <hi>viz:</hi> the Eternall Will of the <hi>Fiat,</hi> which
in the Fire is a ſterne ſevere zealous Subſtance, and in the Light, the
cauſe of the Joys Kingdome, and of the Spirit of Life; That is the
<hi>Father</hi> of all Subſtances, alſo of his Sonnes, <hi>viz:</hi> of the ſecond <hi>Centers,</hi>
of the Love-deſires.</p>
               <p>502. And The <hi>Other</hi> or <hi>ſecond Center,</hi> of the power of the Light,
is his <hi>Sonne</hi> or Heart, and maketh in himſelf and in the Father the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Principle, <hi>viz:</hi> the Angelicall World, that, is our right Fathers
or <hi>Native</hi> Country, which Chriſt brought into US againe.</p>
               <p>503. And The <hi>Spirit</hi> going forth from the Fire in the Light, is the
<hi>Third Perſon:</hi> in the Light, in the Love, and the Joy-ſource or quality,
He is called <hi>God, the Holy Spirit,</hi> underſtand according to the Sonnes <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:57399:44"/>
and according to the Fires <hi>Center,</hi> he is called, <hi>The Anger-Spirit of
the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>504. In the Dark World HE is the Life of the Helliſh ſource or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
out of all Formes to Nature, In the Fire HE is the Flame of the
fierce wrathfull Anger of God the Father; and in the Light HE is
the flame of the Great Love of God; He is the right Life of God, and
is alſo the Life of all the <hi>Three Principles,</hi> of all the <hi>Three Worlds,</hi> in
<hi>each</hi> World according to <hi>its property;</hi> and is only knowne or
acknowledged and rightly called God the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> according to the
<hi>Love,</hi> viz: according to property of the Sonne of God: Elſe he is
called the <hi>Spirit of the Nature</hi> of all things or Subſtances.</p>
               <p>505. Seeing we here goe ſo deep, we will therefore ſhew you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more, out of <hi>true Love,</hi> and not out of a Deſire ſo totally to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
you, becauſe of your unskilfulneſſe or ignorance: for we know
<hi>you better</hi> then you do your ſelfe: and though we are zealous over
you, yet it ſhould be underſtood heartily, as a <hi>reproofe</hi> of your high
climbed ſtately proud Will, <hi>over,</hi> the Spirit of God, from which I have
my knowledge.</p>
               <p>506. Conſider of the Principle of <hi>Fire,</hi> and ſee how the <hi>Dead</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
and how he dieth: Behold! the Fire is a great hungry <hi>deſire</hi> after
Subſtance, and if it cannot have that, then it <hi>extinguiſheth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>507. Here conſider the <hi>Great deſire</hi> of the Father after the Sonne,
<hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> Principle after the <hi>ſecond:</hi> how the Father thus in great
deſire, loveth the Sonne: for he is his life, elſe were the Fathers Life a
dry <hi>fainting hunger,</hi> like the Devills and the Dark World; for the Fire
<hi>burneth not</hi> without the Subſtance of the Water-Spirit.</p>
               <p>508. Here conſider <hi>what</hi> befell the Devill when he loſt Gods Love
and Meekneſſe; then he remained to be a <hi>dry</hi> hunger in the fierce
Wrath of the Eternall Nature: thus it goeth alſo with the Soul of Man,
for they <hi>originate</hi> all alike out of the Eternall Nature.</p>
               <p>509. Now ſee further, what in the <hi>Center</hi> of the Fire, is the <hi>Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
and Subſtance; you underſtand now, that the fierce wrathfull Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource
<hi>muſt have</hi> Subſtance, and that the Fire-ſource or quality it ſelf
longeth after Subſtance, and if the Fire get the Subſtance, or the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality
of the Water-ſource or quality, into it ſelf, then the Fire
<hi>conſumeth</hi> that Subſtantiality, and then is the <hi>dying</hi> of the Subſtantiality,
for the Subſtantiality goeth againe into the Still Eternity, without, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
or beyond Nature, <hi>viz:</hi> into the <hi>Nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>510. And you ſee rightly, that yet there is <hi>no Dying,</hi> but the Light
goeth forth out of that very Death, out of the Conſumtibility forth,
and the Light is then firſt the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>underſtanding</hi>
and of the <hi>Thoughts</hi> or <hi>Senſes:</hi> Thus Death ariſeth, out of
the Fire-Life, <hi>viz:</hi> into another World, <hi>viz:</hi> into the Eternall Nothing,
into the <hi>Liberty,</hi> without, beſides, or beyond Nature.</p>
               <p>511. And you ſee now, that the Light dwelleth in the Fire without
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57399:45"/>
Source, Quality, or Torment, and <hi>knoweth nothing</hi> of the fierce wrath
of the Fire, for it is in its Eſſence a Love Deſire: <hi>Thus</hi> have I writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
that the Deity, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods <hi>Center,</hi> knew nothing <hi>of the</hi> fall of the
fierce wrathfull Devills; but the firſt Principle <hi>know</hi> it, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Father</hi>
according to the Fires Nature, and according to the Deſire, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the hunger in the Dark world.</p>
               <p>512. Here conſider, beloved, Men and brethren in Chriſt, what the
ſuffering and <hi>dying</hi> of CHRIST, as alſo OUR Dying, is: How our
Soul, muſt in Chriſts <hi>Death,</hi> be introduced into the <hi>Center</hi> of the <hi>Hell</hi>
of Gods Anger, into the Principle of Gods Fire, and go quite through
the ſource or quality of the conſumptibility; into the other World,
<hi>viz:</hi> into the <hi>Liberty,</hi> into the <hi>Center</hi> of the Love of God.</p>
               <p>513. For, <hi>Adam's</hi> Soul had turned it ſelf out, and was <hi>Dead to the
Light</hi> in the Subſtantiality: and therefore the <hi>ſecond Adam,</hi> brought the
Soul againe into the Fire, <hi>viz:</hi> into Gods Anger-ſource or quality,
and <hi>kindled</hi> the Light againe in Death, and there the Light ſhone againe
in the Darkneſſe;<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 2. 14. See verſ. 244.</note> 
                  <hi>That was Death to Death, and a Peſtilence</hi> to the Anger,
viz: <hi>to Hell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>514. The Soul was gone forth out of the <hi>Liberty</hi> of God into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this World, <hi>viz:</hi> into the Subſtantiality of this World, and there
the Divine Light <hi>ſhineth not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>515. And then it had nothing in this Worlds Subſtance, <hi>wherewith</hi>
it could kindle the Eternall Fire ſource or quality, but only the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Subſtance, wherewith the Soul <hi>kindled</hi> its Fire-ſource, ſo now alſo
there ſhone a Sun-and Starre-Light, according to the Principle of <hi>this</hi>
World, <hi>in the Soul;</hi> and Extinguiſhed the Light of God; it gat a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Light
inſtead of the Eternall Light, <hi>wherein</hi> it had been an Angel.</p>
               <p>516. But as to what belonged to its <hi>Center</hi> or Originall, it was in the
Dark World, that was its Ground, and according to the outward Light,
it was in this world: and ſo now when the <hi>Body decaſeth,</hi> then the
Sun-Light is deſtroyed, and the Soul ſtandeth <hi>Naked</hi> in the Dark
World.</p>
               <p>517. Therefore God brought <hi>Divine</hi> Subſtantiality, into the faded diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared
Image of Man, and brought it into the Anger, <hi>viz:</hi> into the Fire
of the Fathers Nature, and <hi>kindled againe</hi> the faded diſappeared Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
of the Image, ſo that the Soul <hi>could</hi> againe eat of the Divine ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiality;
and allay or meeken its Fire, whence the Noble Image <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
againe</hi>
out of Death, into another World, <hi>viz:</hi> into the Liberty,
without, beſides, or beyond Nature, into the Light of the <hi>Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>518. As the Power, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Second Center,</hi> ariſeth up out of the Death
of the Fire of the Father into another World, <hi>viz:</hi> into it ſelf: ſo alſo
doth the Noble Image of Man; It is all but <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> Entrance
into the Divine Life.</p>
               <p>519. And this letteth the Great Myſterie <hi>Myſterum Magum befound</hi>
by you, through Gods Grace, this letteth the <hi>Root</hi> of the Tree
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57399:45"/>
ſtand open to you, if you be ſeeing and Not blinde, not
through conceits of Stories, but through a <hi>kindled Spirit,</hi> out of <hi>Gods
Grace:</hi> through <hi>ſeeing,</hi> and not by conjecture whether it be true
or no.</p>
               <p>520. I need no wreſted forced ſtrange cited <hi>Scriptures,</hi> to demonſtrate
it; I can demonſtrate it in <hi>all things,</hi> I have all the THREE <hi>Worlds,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with all Creatures, for a witneſſe, and yet I am Dumb or Mute
to the unenlightened: I ſee and am NOT ſeen my ſelf.</p>
               <p>521. My Sir Libeller: <hi>Whence</hi> will you then take the Originall of the
Devill? you will <hi>not</hi> allow, the Devill to be a <hi>Great part</hi> of the
Deity according to the Fathers Nature, whereas yet
<hi>Luciſor,</hi> is by Chriſt himſelf called a <hi>Great Prince:</hi> Now if you will not
allow that, then ſhew me <hi>another</hi> Nature out of which the Devill was
Created, than, out of the <hi>Divine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>522. You muſt neceſſarily allow, that the Devills <hi>were Angells,</hi> now
then Angells are children of God, out of Gods <hi>Subſtance;</hi> they are
Creatures, and a Creature muſt needs be out of or from <hi>Nature;</hi> now
if they be Eternall Creatures, then they are alſo proceeded out of
the <hi>Eternall Nature,</hi> and that is God the Fathers in the Firſt Principle.</p>
               <p>523. For you indeed know, that the <hi>Devills</hi> have the properties of
Gods Anger and of the Dark World, and ſo alſo have all <hi>wicked Souls</hi>
of Men: From whence elſe will they have their properties, than from
<hi>their Mother</hi> which hath generated them, if here you <hi>will not</hi> underſtand,
then God help you.</p>
               <p>524. The wicked Soul goeth certainly out of this World into the
<hi>Dark World,</hi> into the Eternall Nature, into its Mother out of which it
is gone forth and proceeded, and wherein it <hi>ſtandeth</hi> Naturally: why
ſhould God elſe be willing to caſt the Soul into Hell-Fire, into that
ſource or quality, if it <hi>were not</hi> proceeded out of that ſource?</p>
               <p>525. The Soul of the <hi>wicked</hi> goeth together with the Devills, againe
into that place, out of which it went forth in the beginning of its
Creation, <hi>viz:</hi> into the <hi>Center</hi> to Nature: and the <hi>Righteous</hi> go through
the Death of the Fire, through Chriſts Love-Fire into the <hi>Eternall Life,</hi>
into the Liberty, without, beſides, or beyond, Nature, in the Light.</p>
               <p>526. When God Created the Angells, then the Father moved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
according to the Eternall Nature, his deſire compriſed the Eſſence
out of his <hi>Subſtance,</hi> wherein ſtood the Wiſdome of all Wonders:
Thus out of Nature are Creatures come to be, according to the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi>
of every Eſſence.</p>
               <p>527. In the <hi>Eſſence,</hi> have the Angells and Devills, and alſo Souls,
been from Eternity, and have been <hi>ſeen</hi> in the Wiſdome, but they
went <hi>into Creatures</hi> in the beginning of the Moving of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>528. What have I now done to the Libeller, in that I have written,
it was <hi>God,</hi> againſt <hi>God?</hi> Do you not underſtand that? The
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57399:46"/>
Devill was a Great Prince of the Place of this World, Created in the
Moving of the <hi>Fathers</hi> Nature; he Imagined according to his <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
He ſhould have<note n="*" place="margin">Or put his Imagination into the Light into the Love.</note> ſet his Imagination in the Light in the <hi>Love</hi> and
Meekneſſe of God; And then he would have continued Gods child
and an Angel.</p>
               <p>529. But he <hi>let</hi> the fierce Wrath <hi>draw</hi> him, and looked back into his
Mother, and Imagined into the Fires property, and would be a <hi>Lord</hi>
of the Light World, he would be <hi>above</hi> God; thus with his Elevation
he <hi>kindled;</hi> the Subſtantiality of his Throne, of the place or ſpace of
<hi>this</hi> World; out of which Earth and Stones are come to be, which
God with the Moving in the <hi>Fiat</hi> afterwards Created.</p>
               <p>530. Wilt thou know this in very plain termes in brief; then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it. When the Subſtance of all Subſtances had once moved it ſelf,
then all Formes would be <hi>Creaturely;</hi> for out of the One only Will
which hath been from Eternity, hath in the Subſtance of all Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
gone forth the <hi>Wills</hi> Forme, according to <hi>Every</hi> Property, in the
Wreſtling Wheele of Nature.</p>
               <p>531. But <hi>Luciſer</hi> had the Light, if he had not now gazed Back into
the <hi>Center</hi> of Nature, he had been one of the <hi>Brighteſt</hi> Princes, for
where there is Great Fire, there is alſo great Light.</p>
               <p>532. Enough concerning <hi>Him:</hi> we ſhall be enough underſtood by thoſe
that are OURS: but for the proud ſelf-conceited Spirits, we have ſet
a faſt Lock and Seale before it, that they cannot apprehend our ſence
or <hi>thoughts:</hi> alſo we ſhall herein mention <hi>no</hi> more to the <hi>Wanton,</hi> in
pleaſure and voluptuouſneſſe, but let it remaine for the<note n="*" place="margin">Time of the <hi>Lilly</hi> in the New-Birth.</note> 
                  <hi>Lilly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>533. The Libeller Blames me very much; He ſaith, I have
written that the Devill is <hi>like</hi> God; if he did ſet
that down with Truth; it is, when he was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel;
for then he was <hi>indeed like</hi> God, for God had through and in
him, made <hi>himſelf Creaturely,</hi> but when he became a Devill, then he
<hi>loſt</hi> the <hi>Divine</hi> Principle, and became, <hi>like</hi> Gods Wrath.</p>
               <p>534. Now therefore the <hi>Strife</hi> was effected only in Gods Anger:
For, with the <hi>firſt</hi> Imagination, he loſt the Love, and could no more
reach the Heart of God: What ſhould God now <hi>doe</hi> to the falſe or
wicked apoſtate or <hi>revolted</hi> Will? He gave him Helliſh-Fire <hi>which</hi> he
deſired, to devoure, inſtead of the Love, ſince he would not have
the one, he <hi>muſt</hi> have the other; they were indeed both his; what
he <hi>choſe,</hi> that he had.</p>
               <p>535. But that it is ſaid; God <hi>could not</hi> withſtand the
Malicious Devill: that, the Libeller <hi>perverts,</hi>
as one that underſtandeth nothing of my Writings, or elſe of meere
Malice: Did he not ſee? how I have deſcribed with all Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that Gods Heart or Love, <hi>went not into</hi> the Devill, for he, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57399:46"/>
                  <hi>would not</hi> himſelf have it; now where the Will it ſelf willeth <hi>not,
there,</hi> is, an Eternall Death.</p>
               <p>536. The Will-Spirit was indeed in the Originall out of Gods Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but when it demerſed it ſelf into the <hi>Center,</hi> to <hi>hide</hi> it ſelf from
the Light of God; then remained fierce wrathfulneſſe IN fierce wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.
With what now ſhould reſiſtance be made, it was now in
its <hi>moſt</hi> Originall MOTHER.</p>
               <p>537. Should Gods Love goe into the Helliſh Fire, <hi>that is not to be;</hi>
ſhould God in his Wrath ſtrive againſt it: it ſate already in the Helliſh
Fire: <hi>Had not</hi> fierce Wrath ſtriven with fierce Wrath, <hi>then</hi> had not
Gods Anger <hi>yet</hi> moved, in the place of this World.</p>
               <p>538. Conſider but the Earth, thou wilt well finde it, thou <hi>blinde
World,</hi> with all thy <hi>Texts</hi> of Scripture which thou haſt <hi>produced,</hi> thou
wilt not put one word in my Book <hi>back</hi> from its place, only that
thou ſetteſt a ſtrange vizard upon me, that the <hi>people</hi> might not know
me, which I eſteem not, for I am to YOU a very ſtrange Man.</p>
               <p>539. Thou canſt not in thy <hi>Hood</hi> look me in the Face, thou muſt
put off thy <hi>skinne,</hi> if thou wilt <hi>ſee</hi> the Spirit of the Myſtery; Thou
underſtandeſt Not, what thou <hi>writeſt</hi> againſt me, thou diſcourſeſt not
concerning my apprehenſion, and that maketh that thou, ſeeſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
that is <hi>ſtrange;</hi> thou wilt not ſee, that it is the <hi>Roote</hi> of the

<hi>toucheſt</hi> one little twig thereof.</p>
               <p>540. Thou runneſt againe into thy <hi>Center,</hi> towards <hi>Babel,</hi> and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
upon an<note n="†" place="margin">Or Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</note> 
                  <hi>Academy,</hi> out of which, Opinons and the <hi>Greateſt</hi> Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel

Experience.</p>
               <p>541. God hath Elected ALL of us in ONE <hi>Soul</hi> and in ONE <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
Body</hi> to be his Children; God hath <hi>not</hi> breathed into <hi>Adam</hi> TWO
Spirits, but One only, which is <hi>the Spirit</hi> of all the Three Principles;
of all Three Worlds, <hi>viz:</hi> a Fire-Light-and-Aire-Spirit.</p>
               <p>542. <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have managed his Dominion with the Light-Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
then would the Fire-ſource or <hi>quality,</hi> have been <hi>hidden</hi> in its
Principle, and have ſtood in great joy, it had burned only in it
ſelf.</p>
               <p>543. Thus alſo the<note n="†" place="margin">NOTE.</note> Spirit of this World, that ſhould alſo have
ſtood only in it ſelf, and have been manifeſt in <hi>this</hi> World, and the
Fire, and alſo, the Outward World, ſhould have ſtood as if were
<hi>ſwollowed up</hi> into the Light, and have been manifeſt only in it ſelf,
all deſires ſhould have been ſet in the Light, and then the Light had
ſhined in all Eſſences and <hi>deſires,</hi> and had filled all, as in ONE
<hi>Will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>544. But when the Will of the <hi>Center,</hi> viz: the Fiery Will, which
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57399:47"/>
is called the Soul, went into the Earthly kingdome, and <hi>Imagined</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Evill and Good, then it received alſo the<note n="*" place="margin">Evill and Good.</note> ſame, then its Light
Extinguiſhed, and it remained in its Mother, a <hi>dark dry hunger,</hi> and
muſt help it ſelf with the Spirit of this World, as with a Sun-Light.</p>
               <p>545. Therefore it comes to paſſe, that many times when a Man go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the <hi>dark,</hi> he is aſtoniſhed and terrified, and alwayes afraid
ſomewhat ſhould lay hold on him, that is the feare of the <hi>Soul,</hi> whèn
it perceiveth it ſelf to be without the Light of the Sun in a <hi>dark</hi> Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,
it is afraid of Gods fierce Wrath in the <hi>Center,</hi> and of the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills</hi>
that dwell in the Darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>546. Since then the Divine Light is Extinguiſhed in the Soul,
therefore Mans Life and Spirit, at preſent without the New Birth,
<hi>ſtandeth</hi> in two Regiments or Dominions, <hi>viz:</hi> in the <hi>Souls Fire,</hi> it is
the Dominion of Gods Anger, and of the fierce Wrath, as the Fires
property is.</p>
               <p>547. And according to the <hi>Spirit of this World,</hi> it is Evill and Good,
according to the <hi>Sun,</hi> and according to the <hi>Conſtellation</hi> of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Starry and Elementary Spirit, it is alwayes according to its
Conſtellation which ſtood in its <hi>Birth,</hi> as alſo hath ſtood in its <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception;</hi>
As that it is at all times aſpected with the Conjunction of the
Conſtellatiſon, with the <hi>Imagination</hi> of the Conſtellation; ſo is alſo the
<hi>outward</hi> Will-Spirit: unleſſe it be, that the Soul doe attaine the <hi>Divine</hi>
Light againe in the New Birth, and then the Soul conſtraineth the
outward Spirit with the power of the Light, and <hi>leadeth</hi> it captive.</p>
               <p>548. My Libeller; your conceit deceiveth you; I know of no more
but ONE only Spirit, according to the Property of ALL THREE
<hi>Worlds,</hi> which is in Man, and when the Light Extinguiſheth, then it
is in TWO Properties: that which receiveth the Light of God, that
is Elected to be a childe of God.</p>
               <p>549. <hi>Now it lyeth indeed in Man, that he ſhould ſeek and</hi> deſire
<hi>it; for Chriſt ſaith;</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Math. 7. 7. Luk. 11. 9. 12.</note> Knock and it will be opened unto you, ſeek, and you

                  <note n="†" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 4.</note> There is no ſonne, that asketh for an

be ſaved.</p>
               <p>550. Where now remaines in <hi>theſe</hi> words and Promiſes, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate
purpoſe of God to the <hi>Hardening;</hi> or where are the <hi>Two Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
whereof God loveth the one, and hardeneth the other? We have
indeed <hi>All,</hi> but <hi>One</hi> only Soul, and that is <hi>free,</hi> it may frame its Will
in Gods Love or Anger, into which ſoever it caſteth it ſelf with its
deſire, <hi>there</hi> it is.</p>
               <p>551. It cometh to paſſe many times, that a Soul hath <hi>demerſed</hi> it ſelf
with its Will-Spirit into Gods Anger into the Dark World, in its
fierce Wrath to all Devills, with its <hi>ſinnes,</hi> and yet <hi>many</hi> in the time
of this world, goe out againe and convert, and God <hi>receiveth</hi> them to
Grace; He hardeneth them <hi>not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:57399:47"/>
552. Have you not an Example in the <hi>Prodigali loſt ſonne,</hi> who had
conſumed all his righteouſneſſe of his Fathers Inheritance, with the
Devills Swine: and was become a <hi>Swinheard:</hi> What the Father did
with him when he came againe, how he <hi>fell about hu neck, and kiſſed
him,</hi> and ſaid,<note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 15. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>This is my beloved ſonne, whom I had loſt, he was dead,
and is become living:</hi> it is likely thou wilt ſay; God <hi>drew</hi> him, elſe he
had not come.</p>
               <p>553. The Soul is Free, God <hi>draweth every one;</hi> who incline towards
him, when it entereth into him, then <hi>it is Elected</hi> to the Light World:
ſo long as the Will remaineth in the fierce Wrath in the Dark World
<hi>covered</hi> with the Outward; <hi>ſo long</hi> God willeth it not, and it is <hi>not
drawne,</hi> but when it inclineth it ſelf towards Gods Face, and doth
but a little <hi>Imagine</hi> into Gods Love, then the Divine Life becometh
ſtirring.</p>
               <p>554. Underſtand, the <hi>Word is become Man</hi> or Incarnate, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the Soul, <hi>viz:</hi> in the Fathers Principle, in the ſound; for it
hath by its entrance into the Anger, ſet the <hi>Looking Glaſſe</hi> of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
<hi>viz:</hi> the Virgin of the <hi>Divine</hi> Wiſdome, before the Soul, that
it ſhould behold it ſelf therein.</p>
               <p>555. The <hi>Wiſdome</hi> ſaith continually, <hi>Come;</hi> then ſaith the <hi>Devill</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde

Elected for a Childe.</p>
               <p>556. God letteth no Soul, (which hath Light) to Extinguiſh its
Light out of his <hi>predeſtinate</hi> purpoſe: The Free-Will Extinguiſheth it:
The Devill ſet himſelf in the forme of an Angel before the Soul, that it
might <hi>Imagine</hi> in Evill and Good, thus then its Imagination eateth of
Evill and Good, and ſo the Soul becometh blinde, and <hi>captivated</hi> in its
Imagination.</p>
               <p>557. Elſe if God did harden any out of his predeſtinate purpoſe,
and did <hi>let</hi> his Light <hi>Extinguiſh</hi> out of his predeſtinate purpoſe, then
would not that be true which <hi>David</hi> ſaith in the 5. Pſalme, <hi>Thou art not
a God that willeſt Evill:</hi> indeed he <hi>permitteth</hi> it to come to paſſe, that an
honeſt vertuous Man becometh Evill, when the Will inclineth into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
<hi>then</hi> he letteth his Light Extinguiſh.</p>
               <p>558. But not out of his predeſtinate purpoſe; ſo that he would not
ſaine have that very Man: <hi>ſurely</hi> he receiveth him if he cometh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine:
ſo long as a Man liveth in <hi>this</hi> Tabernacle, he hath power to
become the Childe of God: for the Apoſtle ſaith alſo thus;<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 1. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>He hath
given us power to become the Children of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>559. Underſtand, not out of or from the Will of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> viz: of the
<hi>outward</hi> World; that belongeth not to Gods Kingdome, but out of or
from the Will of the <hi>Souls Spirit,</hi> which becometh Generated or born
<hi>in God:</hi> For, Gods predeſfinate purpoſe is, that the right Divine Will,
ſhould alwayes become Generated out of the Soul, which is done,
when the Soul <hi>entereth</hi> into the becoming Man or Incarnation of
Chriſt, in <hi>that</hi> it becometh Generated or born againe to be Gods childe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:57399:48"/>
560. For the Souls-Fire becometh <hi>introduced</hi> into Chriſts Death, and
Sprouteth againe with a New faire bloſſome, out of the Death of
Chriſt forth into the <hi>Divine Liberty,</hi> into the Angelicall World.</p>
               <p>561. That very Bloſſome or <hi>Spirituall Will,</hi> is Gods Will, and in that
very Will-Spirit the Soul is an <hi>Angel,</hi> for it poſſeſſeth the Second Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<hi>viz:</hi> Gods Majeſty; it continually introduceth <hi>Divine Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality,</hi>
viz: Chriſts Fleſh, which filleth the Heaven, ſo that the Soul
<note n="†" place="margin">Joh: 6. 54.</note>
                  <hi>eareth of Chriſts Fleſh, and drinketh his Bloud,</hi> John 6. out of the Water
of the <hi>Meekneſſe</hi> of the <hi>Eternall Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>562. Therefore, I ſay with good Ground: It is not Gods predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
purpoſed Will, that <hi>any one</hi> Man becometh <hi>Loſt;</hi> but it is from
the Will of his fierce Wrath and Anger, and of the Dark World and
of the Devill.</p>
               <p>563. Therefore he is a falſe or wicked <hi>Judger,</hi> and an <hi>Advocate</hi> of
Gods Anger; who will Judge, and blame God, and knoweth not, the
<hi>difference,</hi> of what God is in Love and Anger, and knoweth not
whence an Evill, and Good, Will, Originateth: and yet will be a Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger:
he cryeth continually, <hi>God, God,</hi> it is, that doth a thing.</p>
               <p>564. The Prophets and Apoſtles, have often, called the <hi>Totall</hi>
God according to Love and Anger, as alſo according to all the
Three Principles, by ONE WORD; but yet a Man ſhould uſe a
right underſtanding, and make a <hi>diſtinction</hi> between Gods Love-Will
and his Anger-Will.</p>
               <p>565. We ſee very plainly in <hi>Man,</hi> that he willeth Evill and Good:
he would alwayes ſaine be an Angel, and would alſo faine have the
Pride, in Covetouſneſſe and the Power of this World; Men ſhould
ſearch, whence <hi>every Will</hi> taketh its Originall; and not alwayes ſay,
<hi>God, God, God,</hi> willeth it.</p>
               <p>566. He willeth only that which is <hi>like</hi> himſelf; his Love, <hi>viz:</hi> the
Right Name of God, willeth only, that we ſhould Love God, and our
Neighbour, and Continue in his deſire and will; HE willeth nothing
elſe, but that all Men ſhould turne to him, and goe out from fierce
Wrath into the Love; For,<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 7. 12. Ch: 22. 37. to the 40.</note> 
                  <hi>the Love of God and of our Neighbour is the
whole Law and the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>567. On the Contrary, his fierce Wrath and Anger, which is the
<hi>Roote</hi> of the outward World, willeth <hi>its like,</hi> to have ſewell or wood
for its Fire.</p>
               <p>568. Now being Gods Love, hath ſet before Man, the Looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Glaſſe,
of his <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> in the becoming Man, or Incarnation of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
why then doth he goe into the <hi>Anger</hi> Looking-Glaſſe, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the Devill ſway him? God indeed ſendeth Prophets and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
out of his <hi>predeſtinate</hi> purpoſe; who reveale and ſignifie, to the
World, his Anger: why doth Man follow <hi>Sinne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>569. That muſt needs be a wonderfull thing: that God ſhould cauſe
any to be called to come to HIM, and yet would harden him out
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57399:48"/>
of his <hi>predeſtinate</hi> purpoſe, that he Could not: <hi>then</hi> God would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous;
Indeed the <hi>Luſt</hi> of the Fleſh and of the Devill <hi>hardeneth</hi> the
Soul, and holdeth it Captive.</p>
               <p>570. If God had willed the Evill or the Fall of Man, then he <hi>would
not</hi> have forbidden <hi>Adam</hi> the Tree of Good and of Evill, <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Luſt</hi>
or Pleaſure of this World: But if he hath forbidden him, and hath
alſo hardened him, that he <hi>could not</hi> doe Gods Will; <hi>who</hi> would now
be righteous, God, or Man?</p>
               <p>571. As the Libeller ſuppoſeth, that it is out of Gods <hi>predeſtinate</hi>
purpoſe, that <hi>two unlike ſonnes</hi> were generated out of <hi>Adam,</hi> an Evill
and a Good, and will make thereof <hi>two</hi> ſorts of Seed: hearken, make
<hi>two ſorts of Souls,</hi> and then it may be.</p>
               <p>572. When <hi>Adam</hi> became Earthly, then he became drawne of the
Spirit of this World, and Gods Anger became Stirring in him, then
did the Soul <hi>give way,</hi> that the Devill through the Spirit of the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
World, thruſt in Evill Seed into the Souliſh <hi>Eſſence,</hi> for propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
which the Conſtellation of the Configuration hath <hi>increaſed,</hi>
ſo that a fratricide or brother Murtherour, became generated: but was
<hi>that</hi> Gods predeſtinate purpoſe?</p>
               <p>573. Had not <hi>Adam</hi> made himſelf Earthly, then would not Gods fierce
wrath have become Manifeſt or revealed in him, alſo then would
the Conſtellation have had no power over the <hi>Souliſh Seed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>474. For, the outward Kingdome, ſhould not have poſſeſſed and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
Man in the inward Image, it ſhould have been as an <hi>impotency</hi>
or weakneſſe in Man: He was Paradiſicall.</p>
               <p>575. But that it ſtandeth written, <hi>the</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 45. to the 47.</note> 
                  <hi>Outward Man was
Created to a Naturall Life,</hi> thereby it is underſtood, that
Nature is a Ruler or Manifeſter of the Wiſdome of God: and then in the
Mortall fall, <hi>Eve</hi> is underſtood to be a Woman, (and not a Virgin) of
this World.</p>
               <p>576. Whereas it could not be otherwiſe; and that <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood <hi>not</hi>
in the Proba or Tryall; he let him fall into the<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 2. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>ſleep</hi> of the Eternall
Life, and made a Naturall <hi>fleſhly</hi> Woman, out of him, out of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix</hi>
and Rib.</p>
               <p>577. For the ſpirit of the outward World had captivated <hi>Adam,</hi> and
introduced its ſubſtantiality into his <hi>Imagination; whence</hi> he is ſuch a
Naked, ſfinking, hard, palpable, cold, bitter, and hot, Man, like a <hi>Beaſt,</hi>
and is not the Noble Image, which is ſaded and diſappeared in Death,
which is created out of heavenly ſubſtantiality.</p>
               <p>578. But, that thou wilt not allow me <hi>this,</hi> that in Man, underſtand
in the <hi>Third Principle,</hi> a humane Image according to the Angelicall
World, out of the Heavenly ſubſtantiality, hath ſtood, in the Inward:
yet I ſay, that <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> that in the Second Principle goeth forth out
of the Firſt, <hi>viz:</hi> out of the Souls Fire of the Father, into the Second,
out of the Love and Light Fire into the Sonne, was never at all <hi>without
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57399:49"/>
ſubſtance;</hi> for it is the <hi>Driver forth</hi> of the Divine power and ſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>579. Hath now the Light and Spirit of God, been in Man? <hi>viz:</hi> in
<hi>Adam?</hi> then alſo hath Gods ſubſtantiality been <hi>therein:</hi> For, no Fire
<hi>burneth</hi> in Gods Love, unleſſe <hi>it have</hi> DIVINE ſubſtantiality.</p>
               <p>580. Therefore ſaith Chriſt:<note n="*" place="margin">Joh: 6. 53.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoever eateth NOT the Fleſh of the
Son of Man: he hath no part in HIM:</hi> He underſtandeth, the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reity
of his <hi>unmeaſurable</hi> Eternall Divine Subſtantiality in the Water of
the Eternall Life; and in the Tincture of the Power out of the Fire
and Light, in the Glance or Luſtre of the Divine Wiſdome out of
the Words <hi>Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>581. Now if <hi>Adam</hi> hath been a totall ſumilitude according to God,
then he muſt not only have had <hi>Earthly</hi> Subſtance for his Body, if the
Soul had had only Earthly ſource or quality to Eat, then it had <hi>not</hi>
had the <hi>prohibition,</hi> but it had alſo the Corporeity of the Second Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
out of the Heavenly Subſtantiality, that was the right Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Image, which became created in the <hi>Fiat</hi> of the Word.</p>
               <p>582. But the Outward <hi>Fiat,</hi> according to the <hi>Outward</hi> Principle,
Created the Outward Man, and God the Holy Spirit, breathed <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi>
thereinto, according to the ſource or quality and property of <hi>all</hi>
the <hi>Three</hi> Principles, into the outward Image, according to its out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Property, <hi>viz:</hi> the Spirit of the Great World, <hi>Majoris Mundi,</hi>
of the <hi>outward</hi> World; and the Angelicall <hi>Divine</hi> World, according
to the Love of Gods Heart, and according to the Eternall Nature, <hi>viz:</hi>
according to the <hi>Fire</hi>-World; <hi>viz:</hi> according to the Fathers Property,
the right Souliſh; <hi>viz:</hi> the <hi>Center</hi> of the whole Man.</p>
               <p>583. In Brief, what is it, that Men ſhould make many words? Man
was a <hi>Totall ſimilitude</hi> according to God, according to all the Three
Worlds, and their Properties, and <hi>that</hi> he muſt be <hi>againe,</hi> or muſt be
a <hi>hunger</hi>-Spirit in the Dark World.</p>
               <p>584. What he maketh<note n="†" place="margin">Out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or himſelf to be.</note> of himſelf, that he is. He ſtandeth here in

               </p>
               <p>585. The matter is not about the <hi>high knowledge</hi> only, but about the
<hi>taſt</hi> or reliſh, that any becometh the Bread of God which God Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth;
It lyeth little in the knowing, but all in the DOING, it muſt
be DOING, the Evill Branches muſt be Cut off, that good Wine

                  <hi>they were aſhamed,</hi> that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>610. While the Earthly Kingdome ſtood <hi>hidden,</hi> ſo long the Soul

               <p>611. Or do you ſuppoſe: that <hi>Adam</hi> was created to Mortality? O
no! But to the Eternall Life in <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> with Paradiſicall ſource or

               <p>614. It is <hi>not</hi> my entention to blame the high <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but the Crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

617. He <hi>need not</hi> contend with me, I have written for my ſelf, and

               <p>618. If the Libeller had not a <hi>Minde</hi> to reade my Book, he might
have <hi>throwne it away</hi> at the firſt Leafe, what need he ſeek in it for
<hi>ſo much</hi> Evill: Sure he hath an Evill Minde, full of fierce Wrath, that

ſo Evill but ſome men make it worſe. My Book is not Evill, it
meddles with none; only <hi>thou makeſt</hi> it Evill, thou expoundeſt it in

               <p>621. Thou fayeſt there is an evill ſpirit in me, if there were a good
ſpirit in thee, then thou wouldſt <hi>make</hi> the Evill to be Good, and wouldſt
not <hi>pervert</hi> all.</p>
               <p>622. Gods Spirit ſeeketh only Good, he contends with none: he
<hi>Loveth</hi> Man; and where he is in a Man, there he driveth on to Love
and Humility towards his Neighbour, he Teacheth and inſtructeth <hi>Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
and <hi>Meekly,</hi> he lifts not up the Horns; alſo he comes not with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Ligntning; as the Anger in the Fathers Nature, upon Mount

623. God hath in Chriſt <hi>regenerated</hi> us in the Love, not in his fires
property; that we ſhould meet together one with another, with a
Modeſt and amiable <hi>condiſcention</hi> and behaviour in a friendly Will and
intention: and heartily admoniſh one another, as brethren.</p>
               <p>624. We ſhould help up the weak and <hi>erroneous,</hi> and friendly inſtruct
them in the way, and not from the narrow path, plunge them into
the Water, or elſe caſt them into Gods Anger in Hell-fire, as the Libeller
doth, where he ſaith: <hi>Hell Fire is thine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>625. Chriſt ſaith;<note n="*" place="margin">Math. 5. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſoever ſaith unto his Brother thou Fool, he is guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

him to <hi>Hell fire?</hi> O Man! Conſider thy ſelf, convert from ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth
Paths.</p>
               <p>626. We have indeed here is this valley of Miſery; before hand in
the way of our Pilgrimage, a very ſmall narrow<note n="†" place="margin">Or Ladder.</note> Bridge into Gods
Kingdome, why ſhould we our ſelves firſt throw one another down;
doth one goe aſtray, then let the other ſhew him the way; let us deal
one by another as <hi>Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>627. We all are born blind, now then if ſight be afforded us of Grace,
why then doth not one Brother afford <hi>Eyes</hi> to the Other? <hi>Every one</hi>
ſeeth, as God hath favourably afforded him, according as <hi>ſight</hi>
is given to him, why will one brother hate the other, for the ſake of
that, becauſe he knoweth not what the Lord hath given to him.</p>
               <p>628. O how <hi>Miſerable</hi> is this Time of Ours, how the Devill hunteth
for us with Snares and Nets, ſo that <hi>one Brother</hi> reproacheth diſpiſeth
contemneth and ſlayeth, the Other, that he may captivate us in Gods
Anger: How doth he <hi>not</hi> afford us the high honour, which he had, but
loſt it with Pride.</p>
               <p>629. Dear Brethren, beware of <hi>Pride, eſpecially</hi> thoſe that are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
out of much Learning &amp; Knowledge; it is the Pride of <hi>Reaſon,</hi>
and it is Mans <hi>worſt</hi> Enemy, it hath ſet up nothing but Wars and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
of others.</p>
               <p>630. <hi>Syrach</hi> ſaith,<note n="*" place="margin">Eccluſ. 3. 18.</note> The higher thou art, the humblyer behave thy

                  <hi>folly,</hi> if
Gods Spirit in us kindle <hi>not</hi> the knowledge: if I knew all Scriptures
outwardly, and had not the Spirit of <hi>underſtanding,</hi> what were my
knowledge other, then a <hi>Conceit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>631. That, is not Divine knowledge, that any confirm an Opinion
with many Texts of Scripture <hi>collected</hi> and put together; for every
Text hath its <hi>proper</hi> underſtanding, in the place it ſtandeth, according
to the <hi>Matter</hi> treated of; oftentimes it ſignifieth much otherwiſe, then
the purpoſe it is drawn by one for to HIS <hi>Opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>632. The Right knowledge, ſtandeth in this, where any will
Judge, there his knowledge in him ſhould be confirmed from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God; it muſt goe forth from the <hi>Center,</hi> and not from a ſtrange
Mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:57399:52"/>
633. Or doſt thou ſuppoſe, that Gods Spirit hath <hi>ceaſed</hi> to ſpeak? or that
it is Dead? ſo that the Spirit, which moveth in Gods ſeeing, <hi>dare not ſay
any more; Thus ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>634. The Spirit ſheweth it what it ſhould ſpeak; only it bewares and
defends it ſelf from the <hi>intermixture</hi> of the Spirit of this World, and from
the <hi>Imagination</hi> of the Devill, that the right humane will ſpirit, which
goeth forth out of the ſouls fire into the Light, be not infected with
<hi>its Malignity</hi> or Curſe.</p>
               <p>635. There is no better Medicine or <hi>Antidote,</hi> then the Deſire of
Love, and the Humility: ſo long as it goeth on and judgeth, in Love
and Humility in the ſeeing of the <hi>Divine</hi> Power, ſo long is his Word,
GODS WORD, for it is approved by the Spirit of God: <hi>it goeth upon
the wings of the Wind,</hi> in the pure humane will-ſpirit: as <hi>David</hi> ſaith,
<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 18. 10.</note>
                  <hi>The Lord Rideth upon the Wings of the Wind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>636. You find by no Prophet or Apoſtle, that any hath ſpoken from
anothers Mouth, but from his <hi>own Gift:</hi> ſomtime, the Spirit hath
brought in a Text, and thereby <hi>cleered</hi> other Scriptures, but the
<hi>Maine Matter</hi> hath been ſet downe out of his own Spirit and
Mouth.</p>
               <p>637. Who hath prohibited us, that we ſhould not dare to ſpeak out
of the <hi>Gifts</hi> of our Spirit, but that we ſhould only ſpeak with a <hi>ſtrange</hi>
Mouth from our Spirit: as the Libeller would have it.</p>
               <p>638. Who hath made a Law, that a man ſhould take away the Speech
from the Spirit; and <hi>change</hi> it into another Forme, but even, the
<hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who hath ſet himſelf to be Lord over Gods Spirit, and
hath <hi>changed</hi> the Mouth of the holy Children into <hi>his</hi> Colour and
Will.</p>
               <p>639. Indeed the High Apoſtles have not commanded it: but they
ſaid:<note n="*" place="margin">NOTE.</note> 
                  <hi>Keep in Remembrance JESUS CHRIST, who dyed for us and roſe
againe, and did bid us Teach and Preach that:</hi> they have barred up the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of no Man, or commanded his Tongue to be altogether <hi>changed</hi>
into THEIR <hi>Words:</hi> They have all of them indeed ſpoken together
every one out of his own Tongue, and yet out of ONE Spirit, which
was CHRISTS.</p>
               <p>640. We have ſtill at this very Day, the very SAME Spirit, if ſo be,
we are born or generated out of HIM; dare it not then now ſpeak,
what is Neceſſary at this Time: what is the Cauſe, that the <hi>Center</hi> of
the Holy Trinity Manifeſteth or Revealeth it ſelfe? even <hi>Mens
Seeking, their</hi> Deſiring.</p>
               <p>641. Men ſtrive now about the <hi>Perſon of Chriſt,</hi> about
Gods <hi>Election,</hi> and Men raiſe Wars and reproaches about it,
and that, Gods Love will have <hi>no more,</hi> to be, and he will rather mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
or reveale himſelf, that Men ſhould yet ſee what he doth, and ſo
goe out from <hi>ſtriſe</hi> about <hi>Gods Will,</hi> into a right Apoſtolick life,
and no more contend about the knowledge, as is done hitherto for a long
time in <hi>Babel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:57399:53"/>
642. But, that now thus, a ſimple Mouth, muſt ſpeak ſuch great
Things; and NOT <hi>one</hi> highly Learned: Aſk that of God, why he doth
it? If now a Shepheard as <hi>David</hi> was, ſhould be a <hi>King,</hi> from the
Command of God; the World would not beleeve it, at all, till he did
<hi>ſit</hi> in <hi>Kingly</hi> Honour and Glory.</p>
               <p>643. CHRIST indeed came in a meek-lowly Forme or Condition,
alſo his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were meane People: God can doe ſo ſtill; that he
may bring to nothing the own ſelf-Reaſon of this World.</p>
               <p>I ſay we ſpeak what we Know and Witneſſe what
we ſee.</p>
               <p>644. There groweth a <hi>Lilly</hi> in the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
