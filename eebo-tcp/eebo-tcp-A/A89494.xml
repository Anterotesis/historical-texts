         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The pretended fears of danger from <hi>Seperatiſts, Browniſts,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>REader, if thou expecteſt here a polite ſtile or
fluent phraſe, thou wilt be deceived in thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation:
it is not Rhetorick but reaſon can ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the judgment (which this Author intended) the
former may cozen the conſcience, and dazle ſimple
men: the latter onely can ſatisfie the Wiſe, and
lead to truth. A rough Diamond is precious, when
the beſt wrought glaſſe is deſpicable; the painted
Oratory (which beſt pleaſeth the vulgar) ill ſuits
with the well becoming gravity of a Statiſt. The
right ſtating of many queſtions in the inſuing Trea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tiſe
hath neceſsitated the dilating of ſome ſentences
more then may ſtand with a pleaſing ſtile: yet it
is not doubted but the lovers of Truth will find
that performed which is promiſed. Farwell.</p>

            <p>SO many excellent Treatiſes as have been ſent abroad to
unblind the hoodwinkt world, and all clearing this truth
<hi>(That the Parliament is and ought to be ſupreme Judge)</hi> might
make this ſeem needleſſe, but as for a ſturdy ſore, many plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
are but ſufficient; ſo will it not be miſ-ſpent time by the
clear demonſtrations of truth and right reaſon to beat down
that wall of the too-much-loved-ignorance which hitherto
hath kept rhe divine light of the truth from entring into the
dark (&amp; therfore miſerable) ſouls of thoſe deluded ones who
with ſo much earneſtneſſe lay out their eſtates, expoſe their
families to a thouſand miſeries, nay ſpend even their deareſt
bloud to inſlave themſelves and poſterity. Love and duty
to religion and my countrey, now flaming with the fire theſe
men have kindled, &amp; yet give fuell to, yea even pitie to theſe
men hath inforc'd a pen ever before ſtill to expoſe it ſelfe to
publike cenſure, and if by this poor labour of mine any of
theſe ignorantly erring men may be reduced, I have my end;
as for thoſe who inraged with malice willingly oppoſe the
truth, God hath provided her another champion, even the
ſword, to vindicate her ſelfe from the violence of thoſe
men on whom the power of reaſon hath no effect.</p>
            <p>To attain this our end, what readier way have we then
1. To diſcover the falſity of thoſe pretences by which thoſe
men are deluded, the miſeries they bring themſelves and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
into if they yet perſiſt: 2. To diſcover the way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
our now almoſt loſt liberty and religion: 3. To free us
from the pretended fears of the invaſion of our liberty by the
Parliament, or of our religion by Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, and
the like. And here ſo many of theſe men who hitherto
through ignorance, paſſion and miſtake have been enemies to
the Parliament, and in them to their religion, countrey, and
themſelves, I ſay ſo many of theſe as by Gods providence
this little Treatiſe ſhal com unto, are wiſhed out of due care &amp;
love to the Proteſtant Religion ſo deſperately undermined by Jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
plots, out of love to their poor countrey, laws and liberty, now at
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:112518:3"/>
the laſt gaſp as it were either to ſtand or fall, out of pitie to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
and their poſterity, deſigned even to Turkiſh ſlavery, they
would lay aſide all prejudicate thoughts, and ſeriouſly lay to heart the
evidences of truth, love, and labour to defend it whereſoever they find
it: and in hopes they will do this, I will proceed according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
propoſed, which was firſt to diſcover the deceit of that ſophiſtry
by which theſe truth-haters delude their followers &amp; to clear the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
of the Parliament from all aſperſions of wrong or injuſtice:
but becauſe their arts of deceiving are many, and it would require too
much time to anſwer particulars, therefore I ſhall endeavour to draw
them to ſome few generals. The firſt then we have to deal withall is
this, <hi>The ſoveraigne power claimed by the Lords and Commons in
Parliament to provide for the Kingdomes ſafety is an intrenching on
His Majeſties juſt Rights, and contrary to the knowne Lawes,</hi> ſay thoſe
deceivers. To anſwer this, and in this the whole bulk of their obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
againſt the Parliament, I ſhall firſt propoſe this to your conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration:
Whether if the King having his royall name and authority
abuſed by thoſe about him, or miſled by his own paſſion or miſtake, do
command and act things pernicious and deſtructive to the people, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
liberty and lawes, contrary to the end and truſt of the firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutors
of this Monarchy, and to the contract at his coronation, and
convert the power of the people it ſelf to back and carry on thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
refuſing to hearken to the petitions of his people, or Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances
of the great Councell of the Kingdome (if in this caſe the
people be remedileſſe) conſider whether the condition of a free nation
be not worſe then that of a moſt miſerable ſlave, and whether the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
of this Monarchy have not provided better for the means, then
for the end it ſelf, the peoples welfare, which is the end of all govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
For firſt, being before in a free and happy eſtate every way, it
muſt bring it ſelf into ſervitude, and each man make one another mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,
and thoſe he holds deareſt, and his Countrey it ſelf ſlaves, and
muſt expoſe his own life, that he may take the lives of whoſoever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeth
ſlavery. Secondly, beſides thus each man being one anothers
mutually, and all their countreys executioners, each muſt be bound to
expoſe all he hath, and his life as much as In him lieth, to procure or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the means of damnation of thoſe he holds deareſt, nay of innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable
others, and of himſelfe (Religion being part of the caſe.) Thus
whereas it ſeems ſufficient to the conſtitution of a ſlave, not to have
power to diſpoſe of himſelf, or of what he hath in a paſſive way one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in this caſe men muſt be poſitively active againſt themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:112518:3"/>
Thirdly and laſtly, a whole Nation cannot fly, or run away
from a condition ſo miſerable, and by any other meanes unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
as a particular ſlave may.</p>
            <p>More might be ſaid in this point, but what needed thus much, were
not their Judgements with whom we deale as turbu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
they have troubled; which ſort a poſſibilitie of deluſion, that
yet may partly hoodwinke them, muſt diſtinguiſh from the other
part among them, whom malice hath made utterly reaſon, and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
proofe; and therefore their ſenſes, whoſe ſoules ſeeme nothing
els, are to be dealt with in another method.</p>
            <p>But to the point; the premiſes and conſequence being utterly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd,
inconſiſtent, contradictory, againſt reaſon and nature, Princes
being inſtituted for the peoples happines, and ſo rather <hi>publici ſervi,</hi>
as <hi>regnum ſplendida ſervitus:</hi> and ſince there is proviſion againſt the
danger of the minoritie of a Prince, who can be onely poſitively ill,
it being <hi>à fortiori</hi> reaſonable, that it ſhould not be wanting againſt
the perill from ſuch a Prince, as we propound, who by meanes of a
greater maturitie and authoritie, may concurre more actively, and
conſequently more perniciouſly to the greateſt evill, the people in
our caſe, if or when the King makes ſuch attempts in reaſon cannot
be without meanes of remedy. It were perhaps ſo were a King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
in an immediate miraculous extraordinary manner by God
himſelfe, then a lower power could not diſanull the act of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
or perhaps there were colour, if the people it ſelfe had abſolutely
given or entruſted it ſelfe to the power or Proviſion of the Prince at
the firſt inſtitution, or framing of the Monarchy. But with us the
lawes, cuſtomes, priviledges, power, and uſe of Parliaments &amp;c.
argue, or rather are limitations, reſtrictions, conditions, or reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made upon the originall truſt, commiſſion, or delegation from
the people, or after upon occaſion, which it keeps in its owne power,
or reſerves to it ſelfe, as the ſupreame reſort for extraordinary emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.
Nor let any thinke that the King having taken his oath for
the keeping himſelfe within his bounds, or for the obſerving the
lawes, liberties, priviledges, or the like, that he is hereupon onely left
to God and his conſcience, and the people without humane remedy,
if he exorbitate; for they ought not to preſume, but to prove ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(if they could) this, which were for the diſadvantage of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſo mainely, for whoſe good all was intended at the firſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Monarchy; and the peoples happines ought to be rather
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:112518:4"/>
favoured and preferred in the interpretation of a doubtfull matter
(were this ſuch) as aſſuredly according with the firſt inſtitutors in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:
and I thinke it is not ſo apparent (if it be apparent at all)
that the King is ſo left to God onely, as it is that the ſafetie and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines
of the people is <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x ſuprema,</hi> and the end of all, which is out of
doubt; and therefore by this tye of an oath, and all other ſitting
ties, power, and meanes alſo intended to be procured, and ſecured;
and all oft little enough (though ſuch power is unleſſe upon neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
not onely not to be exerciſed, but alſo to be kept as ſecret, as may
be, that the Princes authoritie in as much as it may make for the
good of the people, may be kept up.) And perhaps the oath the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
hath taken to the King, eſpecially as the people is repreſented in
Parliament, may (reſpecting at this time this reaſon onely) inferre
as well on the peoples ſide, that it is left to God onely thereupon, and
ſo ſupreame in point of judgement and power: but allowing, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
underſtanding truly ſuch power to be in the people, and from it
in the Parliament (as hereafter may further appeare wee are to doe)
is not this way the peoples libertie, rights, happines, ſafer and better
aſſured, together with the Kings juſt power or prerogative, ſince the
Parliament is not capable (could it be willing) to uſurpe upon either
(as after may be ſhewed) then imagining ſuch ſupreame power to
be inveſted in the King, either the peoples right or the Kings juſt
power it ſelfe can be; ſeeing no man will deny but Kings are ſubjects
capable of arbitrary or tyrannicall power oft times willing and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the attempt, and ſometimes actually prevailing. So, if the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
of this Monarchy had intended ſuch paramount power ſhould
be ſtill in the King; and that in ſuch extraordinary emergents as now
appeare in <hi>England,</hi> they had been more ſolicitous of, and provided
better far for one meanes of diverſe ordeined to an end, then for the
very end it ſelfe, the peoples happines, which they had left ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
dangerouſly on one mans conſcience, or will, as it ſhould at
any time happen to change, when ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ure and ſafe a proviſion offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               </gap>y touched) and had prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the meanes before the end: and ſo doe all the deſperate malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
and the diſorderers of our times &amp; State, which is retrograde
to reaſon: others may better enforce this point touching the intent

bleſſing: but ſuch diffidence and ſuſpition in the Clergie (if it ſhould
not be preſent in Parliament) argues ill deſerving, ſince the juſtice
and wiſdom of the Parliament, as principles of this government
ought not to be queſtioned: but how much more is the Clergie to

ſymbolizing with it in temporall pride, riches and greatneſſe,
and even Antichriſtian domination through the breaches and ruins
of their Countrey, rather then even a Parliament ſhall queſtion it.
The Parliament then, and under this notion of the two Houſes in
theſe times underſtood, being our onely remedie, or rather Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
it follows it may and is to be Judge of the danger or diſeaſe,
and that of power which is to remedie if it be ſo, is to try whether
it be ſo; for without judgement or knowledge of the diſeaſe how
can there be remedie? or how ſhall the Phyſitian know, what, when
and how to apply? If it be the onely competent Judge of this our
dangerous diſeaſe, and of the meanes to meet with, or expell it (the
knowledge of the remedie depending eſſentially upon the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Maladie, and receiving thence its Judications) it hath
conſequently power to execute, or act, or cauſe to be executed or
acted, what it hath, or ſhall judge or ordain neceſſary for the cure,
elſe ſuch power to judge were vain, and it would ſtill return that the
people were remedileſſe. But WISDOM or Judgement and POWER,
as they are divine coincidents, and all one really and naturally where
they are ſupreme, and eſſentiall as in the Divine nature, it being but
our weakneſſe of underſtanding to conceive them disjoyned ſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:112518:6"/>
(for principles of one facultie queſtioned are to be enforced from an
higher facultie) even in this ſupreme power on earth (which as farre
as frail mortalitie can bear imitates, and repreſents that above) they
ought not to be by us apprehended ſeparate, but mutually preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
or inferring one the other. Let us adde to make up this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtiall
trinity; <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> which laſt may be underſtood in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
caſe, a doing no unjuſt, or diſhonourable thing, but wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the publick good, according to the peoples truſt. And it
were an arch hereſie in the policy of this Monarchy to disjoyn in
our beleef or opinion, the third from the two former. And the Law
ſaying, no diſhonourable thing is to be conceived of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it ſeems all one as to have ſaid in other termes, that it is the
ſupreme Judge of the laſt reſort (and that even without the king,
if he hath excluded himſelf as above, which is more then if he were
far perſonally abſent, or otherwiſe caſually diſenabled, and as much
as if no king at all were for the time) where all appeals are to reſt,
and determine, all men to <hi>acquieſſe,</hi> binding all from queſtioning
what is there done; and inferres the ſupreme power there to reſide,
as being the whole kingdome (in which it is radically and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally

when it judges neceſſarie, and that (if the nature of the occaſion ſo
requires) with the ſuſpenſion of the power of the ſupreame, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Delegate, or Magiſtrate, during that parentheſis of ſtate; for
the kingdome having entruſted the Parliament with all it holds
precious, the effect of the Commiſſion upon the matter being, that
it provide <hi>ne quid reſpublica detrimenti capiat,</hi> it hath conſequently
truſted it with its power, which is the ſupreme, that it may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to perform and execute the truſt, when it judgeth, this cannot
be made good, without uſing that power. But to return; the Law
ſaith alſo, <hi>That the King can do, or doth no wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but it denieth not,
but ill Counſell about him may: or perhaps the Law intends the
king as he is in his great Counſell, where he is as <hi>Sol in Leone,</hi> or any
Planet (as they ſay) in his proper houſe; of farre greater vertue and
power, then otherwiſe. But however, Reaſon tells us, that a Prince
or a few of his Cabinet counſell, may far more eaſily erre in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or poſſibly in point of will, then the multitude of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(ſo many whereof are ſelected out of the whole Kingdom by
the people) in point of Judgement, much more of will, or well
willing to the publique (whereof themſelves are ſo great a part):
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:112518:6"/>
and this much the rather, in that it is to be feared, that oftentimes,
thoſe privadoes of the Prince, finding out cunningly the Princes
will, inclination, or humour, before they adviſe, and, further to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate
themſelves, ſeconding it, much that there is agitated, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
to be upon the matter the judgement or will but of the
Prince alone.</p>
            <p>Well, I hope we are now come ſafe to this paſſe, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
may and ought in our caſe to defend the people, or kingdoms
rights, uſe the peoples power which is the ſupreame, (as others have
proved to cleare paſſionate men, rather then to ſatisfie any judicious
man, who will not require proofs in a point plain enough of it ſelf)
ever reſident in the people, and ſo in the Parliament, though dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mient,
till it be by the Parliament thought fit to be wakened, which
ſhould it not now be done, ſuch a ſeeming-ſecure, and ſupine ſleep
might have proved a mortall lethargy. But here theſe Sophiſters
think to enter upon us, and to take the benefit of their own wrong;
for ſeeing they have brought the Kingdom to this paſſe, that unleſſe
the Parliament take the power of the kingdom into the kingdoms
or its own hands, it cannot defend it ſelf, or the kingdoms rights,
or rather reſcue them; they would cunningly prepare thoſe, whom
they intend to make ſlaves, by firſt making them ſuch fools, as to
beleeve, that the Parliament intends a change of the Monarchicall
form of government, and to oppreſſe King and people by I know
not what new kind of Arbitrarie tyrannicall government. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the King and Parliament will ſoon be attoned, if any can ſhew
the Parliament by what other way it can diſcharge its truſt and
dutie in this conſtitution of the times, without the power it hath
aſſumed But what if it ſhall appear (I ſhould make ſcruple to uſe
the word ſhall, as if it did not appear alreadie without theſe weak
offers, had we not to do with ſuch as ſeem to have found out ſome
new kind of reaſon, or having antiquated the old, which differenced
man from irrationall creatures, to have ſubſtituted paſſion, or idle
phantaſie in the roome of it; the beſt method indeed for them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
on as good or the ſame proportion of reaſon, to advance
the power of the King into the place of the power of the whole
people or Kingdom; it is their own manner of ſpeech and practiſe
as ſound and good as their own Method, to make ſuch diſtinction
and difference betwixt King and kingdom) what if it ſhall appear,
time bringing every day truth to light, and perhaps even to there
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:112518:7"/>
men ſome <hi>dilucida intervalla,</hi> that there is not the leaſt probabilitie,
that the Parliament can have ſuch a thought of uſurpation, as theſe
men would impoſe or ſeem to ſuppoſe; much leſſe was it ever
heard that any free Parliament, actually made any the leaſt attempt
to that effect, ſo far is it, that ever it effected it: Whereas on the
other ſide, ill Counſell about Princes have attempted oft, and <hi>de
facto,</hi> ſometimes performed the turning of a well poyſed or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
Monarchy, into an arbitrarie tyrannicall power and publique
oppreſſion; by which change, ſuch ill inſtruments appear the onely
gainers; and the malignant ſpleen ſwels in a miſerable conſumed
bodie, the head not exempt, and yet the very ſwelling a dangerous
diſeaſe even to the ſpleen it ſelf at laſt. Unleſſe ſuch monſtrous
times did priviledge, it were high preſumption to think it were not
all ſufficient to ſtop ſuch mouthes to ſay it is a Parliament, and it
were diſhonourable for it to do as they calumniate, and therefore
not to be imagined. This maxime or ground being no more to be
denied, or queſtioned in this Monarchy, then that the earth is round
in naturall Philoſophy, as neer as morrall Philoſophy may arrive at
naturall in point of certitude: though ſhould we grant them that a
Parliament may erre, nay do wrong to Prince, people, or particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
yet that would not follow upon this which they would mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly
inferre, and ayme at; for none but it ſelf, or another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were to correct, or rectifie what a Parliament ſhould have
done amiſſe, and not the King or any other perſons any way what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
much leſſe by force or warre: for he that is allowed to
judge or correct, is allowed thereby at leaſt an equall (if equality for
ſuch an intent can be conceived ſufficient poſſibly): but ſuch equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of power in two diſtinct Magiſtrates (for ſo we muſt diſtinguiſh
King and Parliament here) of different natures, and touching one
and the ſame point or matter in controverſie, cannot be in one and
the ſame ſtate, then ſuch a corrector muſt be allowed ſuperiour and
the corrected ſubordinate, but ſuch the King cannot be in our caſe,
as above is partly ſhewed, and ſhall be further afterwards. How
then can force or warre on his ſide for this cauſe be rationall, and
juſt? nay though it ſhould be but defenſive, much leſſe if offenſive,
or inferred? Since even bare reſiſting the ordinances of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is or preſuppoſes an aſſuming of the ſupreme power to judge
and condemne, ſuch reſiſtance being the execution of the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>

But we ſhall not carry it away ſo eaſily that the Parliament will
not be unjuſt to any, holding ſuch power, ſtrong temptations of
profit corrupt: too oft, where one, or a few are ordinary Judges;
as a little water ſtanding ſooner is putrified, but multitude of theſe
Judges are like the Sea incorruptible: But moneys received, profits
and emoluments accrewing, (it were a ſhame not without a certain
mixture of preſumption to inſiſt on ſuch baſe imputations here,
had not frontleſſe and monſtrous malice been ſo incredibly auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
as actually to raiſe them) may make a dividend ſufficient to
draw to ſome uniuſt act each man or the maior part of ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
very likely; and to draw the more matter of profit, we ſee
how by frequent orders they invite private cauſes; and do they give
any publique account of the moneys they receive from the people,
more then the Malignants could have done for Ship-money? But
we erre; they give publique account: but it is to get credit onely
with the people, that they may be in their ſiniſter practiſes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations
the leſſe ſuſpected, and better ſerved: But ſtay; how
can they have ill ends at all on foot or in agitation, ſince of all their
particular actions and proceedings, of moſt moment, from time to
time, they by their Declarations, or the like, give no leſſe then of
the moneys an account to the world, except they be evident of
themſelves? Should they do that they cannot give reaſon for, but
ſuch malicious vigilance, as we deal with, when it might in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
charge them, and article againſt them upon truths, would
never be driven to the baſe and miſerable ſhifts of theſe generals, and
the like moſt ridiculous impudent tranſparent calumnies for want
of matter to work on; and did not the people ſee clearly, they have
reaſon, and that their ends are meerly the publique good, it would
deſert them; looſing patience upon the ſence of the preſent evils,
which (like the ſickneſſe, which, even the beſt phiſick, before it
can induce a finall ſetled ſtate of health, works in a patient, chiefly
if diſorders, during the cure, alſo foment the peccant humours)
through the malignant traverſes of our Calumniators, both people
and Parliament are of neceſſitie to paſſe through: and were it not
ſo, though the King cannot diſſolve the Parliament, yet the people
poſſibly might recall their elections in each County, ſince the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
doth but <hi>populo volenti imperare;</hi> which if then it doth not
do, what ever ſome few inconſiderable and inconſiderate particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
may have attempted here and there, it appears the major part
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:112518:8"/>
at leaſt approves what paſſeth, and that ſufficeth: but let us take
heed we traduce not theſe traducers; they have a more honourable
conceit of the Parliament: it is not baſe profit onely, but places of
honour, ſuch as are mentioned in their Propoſitions to the King,
or the like they look at, and travail for: but there may be hope,
that theſe that direct, correct the Parliament in all things, will here
tell them, that they are out of their way, and that their neareſt
way had been to have complied with the King, which ſeeing theſe
would ſeem to imagine the Parliament ſo unjuſt and diſhonourable
they need not doubt, they would follow: and by this courſe bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in an arbitrary government; in which caſe (as before is ſaid)
the ill Counſellors, eſpecially being authors or inſtruments of the

arbitrary on the oppreſſed people (we may inſtance in the Starre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber)
or more beneficiall, as leſſe obnoxious to ſtrict ſyndica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

and ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſtrangers to thoſe ſo choſen, leſſe ſubject to favour them,
if this were any thing to ſatisfie the inſatiate malice of thoſe who

would through the ſides of it, ſtrike at the heart and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
of all future Parliaments: ſo upon the matter, by this courſe
the Parliament now holds in ſuch their propoſitions, the people and
kingdom are like to be the onely gainers, as theſe publique miſchiefs
grew from ill Counſellours and Officers. But have not ſome of the
principall Worthies of this Parliament quitted or indangered

being good reaſon to be ſhort and ſlight in an argument or point

or fruition of uncontroulled diſſolute licentiouſneſſe or
pleaſures, by means of the capacitie they now ſtand in, or as they
are a Parliament can be a motive to them to continue the power,
or place they have, longer then the publique neceſſitie or good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires,

an higher kingdome that can indeed equall them and ſuch a change
of the kingdome, and no ſuch as our Malignants would have us

ayme at a tyranny for themſelves, what need they have laid ſuch

and publique proteſts to that purpoſe, which they deſiſt not
from upon all occaſions yet to do, when as, had not their reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
been thus fixed, divers free late declaring themſelves to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,

and the Parliament ſo ſtrong, and ſo many other circumſtances <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
might have been forborn. But to leap over all theſe barres in
imagination (for in Reaſon we never can) ſuppoſe the Parliament
may effect a change of the Monarchy, what form of government
could they bring in inſtead of it (for they will not ſay Anarchie nor
I deny a mixed government, for ſuch is our Monarchy reduced to
his right temper) <hi>Democracy?</hi> Then through perjury, great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and danger, they purſue their own ruine: For Democracy
where the people or multitude governs is enemy to the Nobilitie
and Gentrie, whereof chiefly or ſolely the Parliament conſiſts,
bringing all to a parity, and making all men alike in power, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
taking away eminent perſons quite, as envious or jealous of
them; whereas ſuch have priviledges over the vulgar in a juſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy:
What then doth the Parliament affect <hi>Ariſtocracy?</hi>
(where the Nobility, or chief govern) but the multitude or people
whom the Parliament hath been charged to court, in which multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
reſides or conſiſts the maine ſtrength, and who chooſe the
Commons Houſe, and muſt execute chiefly what the Parliament
orders, without which their orders are nothing, after Democracy
or Monarchy before Ariſtocracy: And doth not the Parliament
(as above is ſaid) from time to time give particular accounts of their
actions to the world? doth there appear any previous preparing
the way or diſpoſing the people for ſuch a change? which were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie,
were it intended? at leaſt after ſo long a time, they would
have begun to carry their deſigne outward, and the people having
found it, would more and more have fallen off: but we ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and the people every day more and more ſatisfied and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of the integritie of their intents. But were the two Houſes a
ſubject poſſibly capable of <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> would the Lords of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Houſe concurre to it, which would reduce each of them to a
parity in power with each Member of the Houſe of Commons, as
Democracy would equall them both with the multitude, for unleſſe
the Lords would looſe by granting this, ſhould the Commons get
any thing (if this yet be any thing) by this imaginary if poſſible
change?) yet how could they continue, or hold it without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:112518:9"/>
of the multitude or people? And ſhould the people unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concurre to the erecting of this or any other forme of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who ſhould oppoſe it? But how fooliſh were it for a people
to feare that which can never be unleſſe it ſelfe will? and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath found it a long time ſtrangely infatuated, inſenſible, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to ſtirre (till time and experience had given too good atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
to the Parliaments next to divine foreſight) even when it
hath made appeare to them their owne rights, liberties, and implo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
defence: and could the Parliament preſume to finde them to
concurre actively to an unjuſt and unreaſonable thing, the erecting
a new tyranny, not without great danger over themſelves, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the oaths and perpetuall Proteſtations of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Scots</hi> in the like occaſion we ſee did not bring in any of
theſe new governments: nay, were the Parliament poſſibly capable
of ſuch tyranny, yet it being in the hands of ſuch a multitude, and
that againſt the good will of the people, (for ſo we muſt here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe)
they were eaſily divided, and ſo the tyranny diſſolved, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
there never wanting a minor part contrary to the reſt, and
contrarietie being the cauſe of diſſolution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſo were not a tyranny
in the hands of one, and in him eſtabliſhed by the good will of a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
faction of malignants: unitie which chiefly makes a Monarchy,
duely tempered the beſt forme of government (as above was ſaid)
making the arbitrary or tyranny of one upon the ſame reaſon, as
the worſt of all, ſo moſt hardly diſſolvible.</p>
            <p>Wee may adde to all, that this Parliament having preſſed for, and
obtained trienniall Parliaments, whereby their actions, and demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
in this preſent Parliament, are ſubjected to frequent and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
examens, ſhould or could they give cauſe, and that perhaps by
Parliaments conſiſting of other members then theſe (not to ſpeake
of other accidents that may procure ſuch a change) ſhould the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
not be ſatisfied with what theſe doe in this preſent Parliament:
it plainely argues, that out of the cleareneſſe of their intentions, acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and conſciences, they are content, nay deſire to leave their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the cenſure of any: their perſons, as concerning future electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to the opinion of the people upon their demerits; if the King
pleaſe not to come among them, and looke to their doings, as they
deſire: If then upon theſe reaſons and much more that might be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
the Parliament cannot have any ſuch end of eſtabliſhing in
themſelves any arbitrary tyranny, or of their owne private emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:112518:10"/>
with the hurt of their Countreys; What can their ayme be
all this while but the publique good, the juſt defence and aſſerting
of their Countreys rights and honour, by the juſt regulating and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
the Monarchy to the due temper? which is all the change of
the government they ſeeme to affect (the ſame holds in all thoſe
that adhere to the Parliament, and in it deſert not themſelves) from
which it had eſpecially through want of due Parliaments exorbita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſo dangerouſly, that had not this like another <hi>Moſes</hi> beene ſent
by our gracious God to redeeme or reſcue us rather then to defend
us, and that with an out-ſtretched arme, forcing the malignants to
it, who as they ever ſhunned it by all meanes, now deadly hate it, as
fearing it, and in that feare confeſſing tacitly, that ſame politick om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence
of it, which is now aſſerted, a worſe then <hi>Aegyptian</hi> ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
in humane probabilitie had overwhelmed us, and conſequently
the true principle or end that moves the malignants, cannot be a true
feare of any arbitrary power to be eſtabliſhed in the Parliament,
though they ſo pretend, to divert us by fooliſhly fearing an imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
impoſſible danger, from looking to and timely oppoſing the true
reall danger imminent and evident, nay to draw us to concurre to
the bringing of it in with our own hands, which is an arbitrary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
at diſcretion, which the malignants themſelves would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh,
and that by a civill warre, to the ruine of all that is precious
with honeſt men, or men of honour: They have had ſuch power
in manner already in their hands; and that which the King is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by them to challenge at this preſent, amounts to no leſſe in effect
as ſhall appeare, the Parliament yet in vigour; what then may we
expect if they ſhould prevaile by force, which now their fallacies and
deluding reaſons are plainely diſcovered they flie unto: What but
that the Court and Paraſites of it, ſhould wallow and revell in all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe,

            <p>But let us end this patheticall flying out, though it be hard for the
inferiour faculties ſometimes not to ſtirre, when the underſtanding
ſomewhat inlightened hath inflamed the will.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, ſo divine a gift as this Parliament thankfully
recognized and made uſe of duely, and the juſt power and dignitie
of the Parliament, and therein all our happineſſe wiſely and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
now once aſſerted, moderation and mediocritie induced, the
Monarchy duely tempered, may be in humaine probabilitie perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
and all the ſurfet become Phyſicke. And this violent Feaver
of the State having amazed and drawne to an head all the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
humours before diſperſed all over the body, and lying dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
hidden, and ſet on fire, conſumed and expelled them (like the
filth of an houſe ſwept into an heape and burnt) the whole body
may be much clearer ſounder and better diſpoſed, then had not ſuch
a diſtemper ever beene.</p>
            <p>I hope it appeares already were there no more then theſe preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
weake reaſons to an ordinary rationall man (if far better from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
be too meane for his Majeſtie) what way he is to take that all
may be well; and ſeeing but one ſide can be truſted with the power
of the Kingdome, which of them is moſt unlikely to tyrannize, or
reduce all to arbitrary government, or which will moſt probably uſe
it to the publique good onely, or whether in ſuch extraordinary
times it doe not moſt ſafely repoſe where it is originally, naturally
inherent, <hi>viz.</hi> in the peoples owne hands, and ſo in the Parliaments:
Nay were the caſe hitherto dubious, yet ſince libertie firſt made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:112518:11"/>
limitted prerogative; for they confine together, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(in whom is the radicall, primary ſupreame power, and who
made Kings, not Kings people) thought beſt, when it firſt made
choice of, or inſtituted this one forme of government among divers
others, which we call Monarchy, and whereof there are ſundry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in ſundry States, ſome more ſome leſſe truſted, or limited, as
the firſt founders pleaſed, (els why are they not all equall ſince free
and voluntary agents worke or doe onely ſo much, or ſo far as they
pleaſe; and the various ſubordinate degrees or kinds of the creatures
prove the divine Majeſtie to be <hi>agens liberrimum,</hi> els the creatures
would be all equall: an involuntary or naturall agent (as Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
termes it) ever working as much as it can, or to the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
or ſphere of its power and activitie, and ſo an equalitie in the
effects) ſince I ſay, libertie or the people firſt created (as I may ſay)
Prerogative, and that ſo tempered, modified, or graduated, as it
thought moſt conducible to its owne happineſſe (for the ſupreame
power ever worketh for it ſelfe rather then for the ſubordinate or
inferiour, as being the end; the efficient and finall cauſes being here
co-incidents) it is juſt, that this, namely, libertie, judge and give law
to that; and that this, if an unnaturall jarre fall out, gaine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper
rather then the other; and ſince the people reſerved ever in its
owne hands, and ſaved to it ſelfe upon the truſt to the Monarchy,
what priviledges, right of Parliament, or liberties, &amp;c. (parcell of
the originall power naturally in the people, and which may draw
backe to the fountaine the derivative power, as the bloud and ſpirits
to the heart, when there is cauſe) it thought beſt, ſurely it muſt doe
this with purpoſe to ſee them conſerved as ſafely as may be, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occaſion to make uſe of them and enjoy them, which could not
be ſurely done without a power reſerved to judge of the ſtate of
them, and when they were to be uſed, and the like, (for if the Prince
be truſted touching the keeping himſelfe within his limits, he may
even as well be truſted abſolutely without limits:) nor ſuch power
to judge of them is to any purpoſe, as above-ſaid, without power to
execute what is judged hereupon fit. So the Parliament judgeth in
this caſe as the firſt authour, and ſuperintendent of the intent, and is
not as a partie to be judged.</p>
            <p>Further, were the matter yet dubious, yet ſeeing the Proteſtant
Religion, the power being in the Parliaments hand, is far more out
of the reach of danger then the other way, even without calling his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:112518:11"/>
Majeſties good meaning into queſtion therein, as I hope anon will
appeare it ought to put it out of all queſtion, how wee are to range
our ſelves in theſe times. The Parliament having (our caſe ſo ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
ſuch power as is deduced, whatſoever would ſeeme to oppoſe
that power and ſtand in their way, as they defend and aſſert the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
good ſo invaded, muſt be voidable: and uſuall ordinary known
lawes or cuſtomes made or in uſe ſuppoſing, or whileſt the Prince
kept duely within his bounds (which the King ſpeakes ſo much of,
ſaying, that he will ever governe by them, and hold all to them)
but ever intending the publique good, are no way to bound or tye up
the tranſcendent power of the Parliament, when it ſhall encounter
new and never before heard of exorbitances or invaſions of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
good, which the times that made thoſe knowne Lawes never
heard of, ſo never provided againſt. But by proportion of reaſon this
Parliament may and ought as well provide by new Ordinances or
orders for ſuch new evills as they encounter, as the former did for
what they then met with: for they had their originall alſo <hi>(ex ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
moribus b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nae leges)</hi> and had thoſe times had ſuch cauſes offered,
as theſe have, they would have provided remedies of a nature like
thoſe this Parliament hath done, the power and generall intentions
of all times, or the univerſall ground being ſtill the ſame, that is, to
defend and vindicate, or procure the publique good: and to tye them
to the knowne or old Lawes in this caſe, where the letter might kill,
were irrationall; for ſo the firſt breaker of the Lawes might take the
priviledge of the Lawes, and advantage of his owne wrong, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the colours of the Lawes fight againſt and overthrow them, or
the rule, reaſon, or intention that cauſed them at firſt.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, nothing was done by the King of publique conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
but by advice of the Judges, it may be anſwered, that the
Parliament is the onely competent Counſell &amp; Judge in caſes neere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerning the publique, and people in generall, which the King
is entruſted upon ſuch occaſions to call, that the whole people may
not but upon extraordinary cauſes be troubled to elect for Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and attend that ſervice: But in ſuch a caſe as ours by virtue
of the legiſlative power reſiding in the Parliament it may make new
Ordinances, at leaſt for the time, as it ſees occaſion and judges to be
in order to that ſupreame and immutable Law, or Law of Lawes,
and end of them all; <hi>Salus populi ſuprema lex,</hi> and that power even
of making new Lawes is ever upon the matter in both Houſes of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:112518:12"/>
Parliament, and that even when the King keepes himſelfe within
his due bounds, and is aſſiſtant in Parliament (how much more then,
as before is ſhewed, if he ſhall by exorbitating dangerouſly bring
himſelfe within the compaſſe of our caſe?) and that the Kings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to what the Parliament propounds to him, to be enacted for
Law, ought not to be denyed, may appeare by comparing this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
part of the Oath, which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> at their Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
take, or ought to take, cited in the Remonſtrance of the
26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May, in haec verba: Concedis juſtas leges, &amp; conſuetudines eſſe
tenendas, &amp; permittis per te eas eſſe protegendas, &amp; ad honorem Dei corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borandas
quas vulgus elegerit ſecundum vires tuas? Reſpondebit (Rex)
Permitto, &amp; concedo.</hi> Comparing this part of the Oath with the
clauſe of the preamble of a Statute there alſo cited, intimating that
the King is bound by his oath to remedy by Law ſuch inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as the Kingdome may ſuffer in the future, as well as to keepe
and protect Lawes already in being; for then either thoſe Latine
words here cited, or ſome part of them, and that the latter, namely,
<hi>Quas vulgus elegerit,</hi> are to be underſtood of Lawes futurely to be
made, or elſe it cannot be ſhewed by what part of the Oath, as the
ſaid preamble affirmes, the King is bound by Law to remedy the
miſchiefs that happen from time to time to his Realme. Nor will
the Lawes of Grammer, or uſe of ſpeech, or cuſtome of phraſe tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
that, <hi>Elegerit,</hi> without the conjunction, <hi>Si,</hi> or the like prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
or regulating it (though we paſſe not by unconſidered the rude
ſpeaking of thoſe times) can ever be taken for <hi>Elegit,</hi> the preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
tenſe: but as it ſtands in the fore-cited place, muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
participate a future nature, and ſignifie preciſely, <hi>ſhall have choſen;</hi>
that is, that the King aſſumeth to confirme ſuch Lawes, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſhall have choſen; it being to be conceived, that the people, or
Parliament firſt amongſt themſelves, muſt have debated of, choſen
and agreed upon them, before they preſent them to the King to be
confirmed. Beſides, if thoſe cited words, <hi>Et permittis per te eſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegendas,
&amp; ad honorem Dei corroborandas quas populus elegerit,</hi> ſhould
not referre to future elections, but to paſt onely, they were ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and vaine: the words precedent, <hi>Concedis juſtas leges &amp; conſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudines
eſſe tenendas</hi> (which preſuppoſe neceſſarily, and cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
without a precedent election and conſent of the people to
them) expreſſing ſufficiently Lawes and cuſtomes elected, already
confirmed and in uſe. And the Kings anſwer to theſe cited words,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:112518:12"/>
being <hi>bimembris,</hi> or two-fold, <hi>Concedo &amp; permitto</hi> (all the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
of the King to the other Queſtions in the Oath, cited in the
ſaid Remonſtrance, becauſe the queſtions are meerely ſimple and
ſingle, conteined in one word only, as to one queſtion onely; <hi>Servabo</hi>
to another onely; <hi>faciam</hi> being alſo ſingle, and in one word) argues
the queſtion to be double, as is ſaid. And that the King is not bound
onely in generall thus to remedy the particular wayes or meanes left
to his choice; ſee the ſaid Remonſtrance, <hi>folio</hi> 8. which ought to
have it ſelfe ſufficed without ſuch poore gleanings, as theſe, or the
like: If then by theſe and other better reaſons which others have
preſented, the Parliament hath ſuch a legiſlative power, even where
the King diſchargeth his office, as upon the matter to make ſuch
Lawes as it judgeth beſt for the publique good; where through the
prevalence of ill men about him, it is not done, but the contrary,
and ſo the danger is from him, ſhall not power be in them to make
new Ordinances, or proviſionall Lawes, for the timely remedying
ſuch publique miſchiefs, at leaſt for the time, and to ſuſpend ſome of
thoſe in being, if they judge fit? How much more then to judge of,
declare, or interpret thoſe that ſeeme dubious, ranging and making
all to be ſubſervient to the ſupreame Law <hi>Salus populi,</hi> the rule and
reaſon of all Lawes, as was ever intended at the making of all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Lawes. Hath not even the Lord Chancellour a little touch of
ſuch a power upon the Common Law? What then may we thinke
a Parliament hath, and that when the very publique is in danger?
And if the whole people unanimouſly conſenting, upon a Princes
not performing what he is bound unto, may poſſibly change the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
forme of that limitted government, which it firſt inſtituted, how
much more may it conſerve or defend that temper or kinde of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which it hath erected by regulating the enormities of
the Prince, by maintaining and holding what they have reſerved
out of that which was all theirs at the firſt, or their owne rights?
How many degrees then are they off from being bound to become
themſelves the inſtruments to overthrow them? how ſtrongly are
they bound to the contrary? And indeed were not the Parliament
the ſupreame Judge in all the ſaid queſtions, or of like nature, (if we
may call it a Parliament at all, not having this power) it could not
poſſibly ſave the people, when ill men prevailing upon the King
would oppreſſe it; for while they carry on by degrees, and mature
by little and little ſuch their myſticall and pernicious deſignes (which
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:112518:13"/>
muſt be met with betimes in ſuch tender and jealous matters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they advance and grow ſtrong, when caution comes too late,
and oppoſition out of ſeaſon doth but exaſperate and increaſe the
evill) they will cauſe the King by fit inſtruments for the purpoſe, to
pronounce, judge, or interpret each ſuch degree or gaining a new
and further point, ſtill lawfull, and not ſubject to queſtion, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
dangerous to the people in it ſelf, and of worſe conſequence, till
the myſterie at laſt unmask, and all be deſperate.</p>
            <p>It may be ſuperadded, that ſhould the Parliament be more jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of the Prince then there were reaſon, (which yet as I hope hath
appeared is not to be imagined of the wiſdom and Juſtice of the
Parliament) yet it were the farre leſſe evill, that the Prince, being
but for the people, ſhould ſomewhat ſuffer by ſuch the Parliaments
jealouſie (which were but <hi>peccare in meliorem, &amp; ſecuriorem partem)</hi>
then that by the Parliaments too much ſecurity and beleeving in the
Prince, the people or whole kingdome ſhould be endangered, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
for whoſe good they both are ordeined, as means for the
end: Beſides that the authority and politique infallibilitie of the
Parliament muſt be by all that love their Countrey, not blemiſhed
but held ſacred and inviolate, as ſupreame. The King indeed ſaith
he will defend and maintain, the Laws, Liberties, properties of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
juſt priviledges of Parliament, but even in ſaying this he ſeems
to violate them, if the thereby aſſume the ſupreame Judgement of
them to himſelf, which, as already partly hath appeared, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hereafter may do, cannot be; Admit this Trojan horſe into
your walls, allow this, all of them may eaſily reſolve into nothing.
Conſider well, what Judgement hath been made of the Laws, the
libertie, the property of the Subject, before this Parliament, whileſt
a future Parliament was doubted and feared, and therefore kept off
as long as theſe Malignants could, (but their fear and hate ſhews
what we ought ardently to deſire, and love) whileſt ſo many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies,
Loane, Conduct, Coat, Ship-money, and the like grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
were brought upon us (our perſons not going Scotfree) as
conſiſting well, and compatible with our laws, liberties, properties,
and adjudged lawfull, which yet what did they, or ere long going
on at leaſt would they have wanted of making them all meerly at
diſcretion, pleaſure, and will, the meer names of ſuch things remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

            <p>The Judgement made of priviledges of Parliament during this
Parliament ſeem to have come little ſhort of the Judgements made
of our liberties, properties, &amp;c. and if it be duely weighed. Firſt,
that they will have the King to be judge of them, then what Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath been lately made, both in fact and in words, or Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of them, a man meanly penetrant will find them reſolved by
the poſitions of theſe Malignants into next to nothing: and all this
while the Parliament was and is in vigour, vindicates, and aſſerts
them, and likely to call theſe men to account, what will they make
of them, ſhould they through the authority, and reputation of this
Parliament, which is the eſſence of it, peirce at once the heart of all
future: for a Parliament not free were no Parliament, and if the
King be allowed judge of priviledges of Parliament, where any new
caſe happens which may touch the very eſſence of it (if it be any
thing elſe then the priviledges) will it not come to this, that the
Judges he appoints, or rather ſuch inſtruments, as the Malignants
about him pleaſe to ſet over us, ſhall upon the matter judge the
Parliament, which is to Judge their Judges, making it and the Laws
what they pleaſe, and to reſtrain the power and freedome of it, as of
the Laws, as they think fit; whereupon would follow even the
ſame inconveniences, which were before mentioned, ſuppoſing the
King the ſupreame Judge of the Laws, namely, that the Parliament
ſhould be diſenabled to defend the people, or indeed it ſelf if incroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
on, or oppreſſed upon the ſame reaſons in that place expreſſed.
But it ſeems more rationall, that ſince the Parliament is to be Judge
of the Laws (as is above ſhewed) nay even may make them, at leaſt
in ſome caſes; it may judge as well of its own priviledges: neither
appears it in the Kings power to make them, what he pleaſes, ſave
onely thus: if he doth not exorbitate, nor innovate any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, neither can the Parliament deſire any alteration of
them in any point, betwixt it and the King, concerning them. But
in caſe of extraordinarie emergents of never-before-heard of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
on his part, whither by any verball declaration, or by fact,
whereby the priviledges, authority or very being (for it may trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a good School-man to diſtinguiſh clearly betwixt theſe three)
it ſelf of the Parliament is indangered, it is reaſon, that the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:112518:14"/>
now become any thing that the Parliament judges fit for the
conſervation of it ſelf. For the maine end and intent of the firſt,
ancient, ordinary, and uſuall priviledges of Parliament, being to
enable, and qualifie it for the due attending, defending or advancing
the publique good (for which purpoſe they were judged ſufficient
by the firſt Inſtitutors, not ſuſpecting ſuch new invaſions, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
on them, or on Parliaments as ſince have happened in more
corrupted times, but thinking them rather ſecure, as part of the
Laws, or cuſtomes which Kings are bound to keep inviolate) why
ſhould not the ſame end and intent, which ever remains in equall
force, immortall, and immovable, work and move, as well to the
inſtituting even of new ones, if new cauſes happen, and without
ſuch new ones the Parliament ſhall remain diſenabled to procure
the publique good, for which it was ordained? and if the Parliament
may in extraordinarie times as now make new Ordinances for the
conſervation of the people, it may make (if need require) new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
or Priviledges (which are but the private Laws of or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Parliament) for its own conſervation, without which
they cannot defend or conſerve the people; and in vain had it power
to make new Ordinances upon new occaſions for the publique
good, if it have no inherent power to make new priviledges or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
upon new emergent dangers to ſave it ſelf, <hi>Poſſe</hi> naturally
and neceſſarily preſuppoſing <hi>Eſſe,</hi> as grounded on it; <hi>Qui dat finem,
dat neceſſaria ad finem:</hi> the priviledges being to defend and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Parliament as the Laws the people, and as <hi>Salus populi</hi> is <hi>lex
ſuprema,</hi> as before, ſo it may as well be ſaid, <hi>Salus Parliamenti ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premum
privilegium.</hi> If it may work new, it may much more inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret,
declare, and judge of the old on occaſion; and are no more to
be held to the old, uſuall, known, priviledges, when new extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
attempts, or affronts happen, then to the old known Laws
onely in the caſe above ſpoken of, and upon the ſame ground and
analogy of reaſon. And here we are fallen unawares on the old Lord
Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> who we need not ſay was a great Stateſman,
who was wont to ſay, <hi>He knew not what a Parliament might not do:</hi>
not much unlike the Archbiſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> (a great Stateſman) who
would tremble (as is ſaid) at the mention of a Parliament, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or rather not knowing the power of it; and had not they both
taken the word <hi>Parliament</hi> in our acception, they had told us no
news. It is one effect of ill Counſell about a Prince (in the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:112518:14"/>
ſomtimes better then in their intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) to miniſter occaſions
to the people by invaſion of their rights, to look narrowly into the
nature of the Princes prerogative, when by the power of truth, it oft
looſeth of the former reputation (which liberty gains): a more dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
light ſetting it of better, and ignorance begetting here devotion,
and admiration, of what is unknown; &amp; hence it is perhaps, that in
theſe times as more polite and penetrant, then many former ages,
Prerogative is ſaid generally to looſe in Chriſtendome, the better
thus fortified againſt the ſo great, and growing danger from the
Common enemy the Turke, and other great <hi>Mahometan</hi> Princes
the great bulwark of Chriſtendome, <hi>Germany,</hi> now ſo torne the
more requiring it) by ſo maine a diſparity in matter of liberty (the
Mahometans uſing their Subjects, as their beaſts, or ſlaves) as well
as of Religion. But to our way from this Digreſſion. We may from
this place take a proſpect another way into the plot of theſe Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants;
being by a crew of our own Nation but unnaturalized, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
not penetrating their deluding pretences by reaſon, as naturally
ſimple, partly having their underſtandings debauched by a will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
ſolicited, or over-ruled by enormous affections, and paſſions:
which ſecond kind may conſtitute a middle degree between malice
and ſimple ignorance (might this ſimple tractate gain one of the
firſt ſort, the pains taken were a pleaſure, but ſhould it hope to win
one of the ſecond degree, this preſumption might make bare par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
too much for it.) There is a third ſort in whom their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
and conſciences though having perfect light and cleerly
diſcerning the truth, and right, yet are like ſlaves forced, and drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by a Diabolicall will (affections in this degree not mentioned,
as arguing groſſe carnality, or corporealneſſe: but theſe are <hi>ſpiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
nequitiae)</hi> by ſuch a ſociety, whileſt they ſpeciouſly pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
priviledges of Parliament, Laws of the Land, liberty, property
of the Subject, &amp;c. but whereof the King muſt be ſupreame Judge
(for in this point lyeth all the myſtery, and <hi>Cabala)</hi> through this
mortall wound of the authority and eſſence of the Parliament, the
true, and onely Judge, and conſequently defender of them all (as
above is ſhewed) to ſtrike the heart of them all, leaving us onely
<hi>tenues umbrae,</hi> or <hi>manes,</hi> or apparitions of them, to purſue, diſtract
and torment us, as acceſſaries to the murder, or rather principals
(ſince no acceſſary in Treaſon) if we paſſively concurre, much more
if we help to act it, thus the matter being diſpoſed they may intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:112518:15"/>
the form (the perfection of the work) and the ſtate at their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
and the way of the Lord Pope prepared, and his crooked
paths made ſtraight, they may eaſily bring him in, as after we may
endeavour to ſhew.</p>
            <p>But if the plot ſeem not deep enough laid, as ſuppoſing and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
at home ſo many monſters, and vipers (though the fewerneed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the ſound partie of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> already diſtracted by
the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion to that end if not at firſt raiſed, yet ſundrie waies
fomented by them) then perhaps to peice it from abroad; and by
cutting the banks of the kingdom to let in a deluge of forrein forces,
and ſo yet further ſubdiſtract the remnant; if we conceive the Fleet
of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſeen not long ſince at the Downs, carried any myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
or came not unſent for, or moved not to no end, or <hi>Hull</hi> ſo eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly

though intended to diſtract <hi>England,</hi> and ruine it, may rather (open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our eyes, and diſabuſing us) by Gods over-ruling unite it as in a
common cauſe againſt an univerſall and evident danger, not to
ſpeak now of other matters judicating the ſame. And they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>England</hi> a government at diſcretion, and all made in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie,
or after the <hi>French</hi> faſhion; if the middle ſort of people of
<hi>England,</hi> and Y comanry, of whom chiefly conſiſt the trained bands,
and wont to be a maine ſtrength of our victorious Armies, can by
no ſubtilties be drawn to their party, then by policy, or even plain
force to diſarme them, ſuſpecting as they have good cauſe that
theſe, if once they be unhoodwinkt, will eſpecially oppoſe the
change as whereby they from being in the happieſt condition of
any of their rank perhaps in <hi>Europe,</hi> nay in the world (who here live
like men, and are wont to fight, or die like men in honour or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of their Countrey) might well be reduced to the termes of the
Peaſants of <hi>France,</hi> of villenage, and ſlavery: a fit recompence for
their danger and pains ſhould they fight and labour to bring it in.
As for the ſcum of the people they judge it either ſenceleſſe, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
of the publique, and deſiring a change, or eaſily drawn, where
there is hope of greater ſpoil, and pillage. We may place ſo much
the more below this ſcum many of the greater ſort, that ſtand for
theſe Malignants againſt the truth and right (every day more and

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:112518:15"/>
as much or more then the Raſcality it ſelf.</p>
            <p>But thought it be ſo with the State, is our Religion in danger that
way alſo? why elſe are the Papiſts ſo active, ſo buſie? is it onely
that they may be ſlaves? but in a politick way onely uſe may be
made of them, and of their power, without any intent to ſymbolize
with them in their religion, as ſometimes hath been done in other
Countreys. Be it ſo (though it be not good to be prodigall and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
in our grants which our religion may pay for) yet taking it this
way, ſo great a ſervice ſo ſeaſonable at ſuch a pinch (when all good
Subjects, and judicious honeſt men fail them) received from the
Papiſt, muſt draw on in way of gratefull acknowledgement, ſome
favour at leaſt ſome advantage, which cannot be but at as much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and diſadvantage of the religion (not to inſiſt how hardly they
will lay down their Armes once taken up, and victorious, or the
King be able to make good his faith, or word). And are not they
the fitteſt and ſureſt meanes to conſerve a State, that have been
thought and found ſuch for the acquiring? But be this as it may it is
clear, that can the Papiſt bring the matter to an abſolute, and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
government, and render the prerogative immenſe and even
divine, they gaine a maine point on our religion, for then between
them and the heaven of their deſires, there were interpoſed but the
turning of one will, and that one alreadie prepared, diſpoſed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to them by ſuch meritorious ſupererogatory ſervice, and
further propitiated by the ſo ſtrong interceſſions (how ſtrong (to
ſpeak like thoſe we have to do with) when uſed by her that may in
ſomethings even command) our ſoveraigne Ladie <hi>Mary.</hi> (I had
rather ſeem to ſome a little too much tyed to ſence onely, and to
the preſent times we yet live in, when I preſumed to uſe that phraſe:
turn, or change of one will; then with others, by the abſtraction of
a potent imagination, found worthy to have been rapt into the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of thoſe times, in ſtead of change of will: to have uſed a phraſe
or ſence ſeeming to ſuch more orthodox, terming it rather an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
manifeſtation and declaration onely to us here below of that
which was ever from the beginning predeſtinated internally ſince
in Gods no reall change nor ſhadow of change) but the other way
a whole Parliament at leaſt muſt be firſt turned, and that in Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trall
oppoſition with the Papiſt, and ſhould forreign Force come in
by Portſmouth, Plymouth, or Falmouth (what if we adde <hi>Ireland?)</hi>
to induce Tyranny, Religion runs equall hazard with the State.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:112518:16"/>
And it may be, the Kings forces running lately with ſo ſtrong bias
ſo eagerly at <hi>Banbury, Warwicke, Coventry, &amp;c.</hi> eſteemed moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
indeed to the Papiſt, though perhaps not otherwiſe direct to
the firſt, or maine mark for the preſent, of theſe Malignants, may
judicate and argue, without any ſophiſtry, a preſent complication
of the diſeaſe, and the duplicity of the deſigne, and danger: or if
not a preſent eſſence of a double diſeaſe, yet a dangerous maladie
now in being alreadie, but breaking out into a ſymptome more to
be taken heed of then the very diſeaſe, and depending on it: But
they object, our Religion is on the other hand more indangered by
Browniſme, Anabaptiſme, &amp;c. ſuppoſe this true, and that theſe
ſhould get ſtrength, nay prevail with the Parliament (which it is
charged to promote upon as likely, as ſtrong, and even the ſame
grounds, as it is to affect the change of the Monarchy, yet as we
ſaid of we know not what new form of government, ſuppoſing ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſly
the Parliament did introduce it, it were eaſily diſſolvible;
ſo obſcure Browniſme or Anabaptiſme were much more eaſily
maſtered, and redreſſed, then moſt politick, potent, all over bearing
Papiſtry, likely to be backed with forreigne force, which I think
none will ſay is to be feared from thoſe other ſcarce known, weak,
poore Sects, whoſe obſcurity, and paucity, hides rather and exempts
from animadverſion, and would the Parliament attempt this
(though we might juſtly refuſe to diſpute with thoſe that denie
principles in this kingdoms policie, calling ſtill in queſtion the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Juſtice and honour of Parliaments) could it ever effect it
without the peoples concurring? Papiſtry ſo increaſed at home, ſo
countenanced might (if it doth not already with their good friends
help in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and elſewhere hope to force entrance). How fooliſh
then is it for the people to fear that, which can never take effect,
unleſſe it ſelf will have it ſo? (I fall unawares upon the ſame anſwer
here uſed before touching the ſuppoſed change of the State, becauſe
the falſe grounds they would ſeem to go on here, and there ſeeming
the ſame) and if the whole kingdom or people will have it ſo there
is no oppoſing. But hath not the Parliament taken a voluntarie
Oath (beſides ſo many publique Proteſtations, and other obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to us, the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the States of the Low Countreys) for the
maintenance of the Proteſtant Religion, which they are too wiſe,
and juſt needleſly to have done, and ſo ſhould they do otherwiſe to
incurre moſt juſtly univerſall falling of, or rather falling on them,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:112518:16"/>
had they had any intent ever to have done, as theſe would ſeeme
to fear, to direct us here alſo from looking at the true fear and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
nay to draw us with our own hands to pull it on us; we may ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradde,
that the voluntary oaths of ſuch a multitude as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on whom no ſuſpition at all can faſten, of inclining to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which takes upon it to diſpence with oaths and equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and thereby with the Law of God, Nature and Nations (which
intended to advance it, will by Gods juſtice advance the ruine of it)
are better ſecurity, then our Malignants have or can give us on the
other ſide, the Antitheſis in each part inquired into duely as the
ſubject well deſerves.</p>
            <p>But theſe men would here alſo take benefit of their own wrong,
according to their uſuall method (it may appear what correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or good intelligence the maine dangers of our Religion and
State ſtill hold mutually, or how they reſemble). Neceſſity of the
State, nay of the very preſervation of it ſelf (whereof theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors
are manifeſtly the authors) may juſtly and too evidently
doth compell the Parliament to the ſetling of Religion, (though
the end of policy and however firſt in eſteeme and intention, yet
not ſo in the time of execution alwayes) after the ordering of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
affairs; and in ſuch deſperate times as theſe, not to do this, were
but a ſacrifice without ſalt, a fooliſh ſuperſtition (like that of the
Jews, who would rather ſit ſtill, and ſo ſuffer themſelves to be cut
in pieces by the capitall enemies of their State and Religion, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to <hi>David</hi> who in neceſſitie ſpared not the very Shewbread)
who maliciouſly invaded them purpoſely at ſuch a time) then arme
or fight upon ſuch neceſſitie on their Sabbath; Which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the Parliament will not now do; which ſhould it now, one
ruine might involve both Church and State both at once: yet hath
it not altogether, even ſuch times notwithſtanding, left it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſome teſtimony of their good intentions herein, as particular
Acts or Orders of theirs do ſhew to the world; but the attempts,
and facts of the Malignants, evident to all men apologize too well
for the Parliament in this point without any words from any man,
if we weigh the deſperate eſtate of publicke affaires well in theſe
times, cauſed by the malice of theſe Monſters; which times forcing
us for a while to content our ſelves with an implicite, or generall
faith, as touching the ordering, reforming, or ſetling of other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
concerning Religion, which cannot for the ſaid neceſſarie

this alſo that of ſuch ordering and ſetling theſe matters, as is to be

from thoſe Divines, that preach and cry down the temporall
greatneſſe, pride, riches, avarice, &amp;c. of the Clergy, and ſo all their
own hopes and pretenſions that way, and conſequently from the
Parliament, which we ſee countenanceth ſuch men, then from the
contrary ſide: that profeſſing likewiſe in a ſpeciall manner and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
mortification, contempt and renouncing of the world, and of
the glory, greatneſſe, and pomp of it, humility and the like (as
minding heavenly matters, and things above) as principles of the
Doctrine and Religion they preſſe upon us, yet are not aſhamed to
appear to the world inveſted (through various myſteries of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)
with ſo great a ſhare of whatſoever the moſt worldly men
(whoſe higheſt contemplations aſcend not to the Moon) compoſe
their Trinity of, as may enable theſe men thus crucified, and dead
to the world by their own earthly power, greatneſſe, authoritie (not
to inſiſt on that kind which they have in our times, attempted to
render, in ſome points, or caſes at leaſt, independent of the crown
and abſolute; and which earthly greatneſſe, rather then the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

to the evident danger of a generall ruine, and abomination of deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

would ſeem to ſtand for) as may enable them, I ſay, by their own
temporall potency (which in the hand of ſuch men becomes more
dreadfull, then any ſpirituall power they exerciſe) ſufficiently to
keep in awfull ſilence, if not to bring into a kind of Inquiſtion,
ſuch as moſt heretically ſhall not captivate and ſubdue their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

chief ones (who ought to be moſt eminent of all in practiſing the

&amp;c. which they recommend, command, and enjoyn, as Leaders
and Captains for all that ſhould follow them on ſo difficult ſervices)
can yet practice and purſue, I ſay, ſo ardently, ſo deſperately the

nay, even conſuting their Doctrine, not be a maine cauſe of the
miſeries and calamities of the world, whileſt deluges of ſinne and
wickedneſſe, and pernicious conſequences breake in at this ſo great
an overture of the faith, thus diſcountenanced, and diſcredited, and
even called in queſtion; will not many incline rather to beleeve,
that this practice, this doctrine, ſo deſtructive one to the other, is
ſowing their feilds with mingled ſeed, wearing a garment mingled
with woollen and linnen, ſo for bidden in the Moſaike Law? That
ſuch a ridiculous unſuitablenes between ſuch profeſſion &amp; doctrine,
ſuch practiſe and deeds, is rather a mockery of the world. Will they
not like one <hi>Cicero</hi> ſpeaks of, wonder <hi>cur aruſpex videns riſum teneret?</hi>
Though the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> ſect be groſſe, and carnall, and the <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans</hi>
themſelves exceeding devout in their kinds, and ſuperſtitious,
having their Church-men in great reverence, diverſe of them rich
and proſuſe otherwiſe in works they conceive any way pious and
charitable, and though otherwiſe the Nation very covetous, yet I
thinke it will not be eaſie to ſhew that their chiefe Church-men in
generall, in any temporall greatneſſe or riches, doe not much rather
reſemble the mendicant Orders among the Papiſts (did they hold
themſelves to their Rules) then the Papiſticall or our Prelates and
chiefe Clergy-men, who yet profeſſe themſelves Leaders in ſo ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
ſo heavenly, and ſublime, ſo world-renouncing a way, faith
and doctrine. It is true the Turkiſh Muphty or chiefe Prieſt, is by
the grand Turke, partly to pleaſe the people, in ſhew and ſhadow
greatly honoured; not perhaps without a competency in revenue,
but I take it hereabouts their devotion of any note this way ends.
As for any temporall greatneſſe and riches the Meſaicall Clergie
might have, wee are taught, theſe were rather groſſe and ſenſible
Types, then any thing elſe, of the ſpirituall eminency, graces, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments,
and power, that ought to ſhine in the ſublime and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Antitype; whence their true authoritie with the people and
reverence, and even veneration to their doctrine, places and perſons
muſt ſlow, conſerved, encreaſed by ever conſtant and invincible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
of the leaſt not neceſſary temporall matter, if preſſed on
them, as an high diſhonour, or affront offered to diſcredit them,
a bribe to corrupt them in the execution of their Embaſſage, a baite
to entrap them and fruſtrate the ſervice they are ſent about, a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of pernicious conſequence, nay, of what the State may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
and aſſigne the Clergie as neceſſary (if it might be) a vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

and abſolute declining of part even of that (for I doubt not but
the State would appoint ſuch a proportion, as might to duely morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and ſpirituall men, afford matter for the honour of ſuch a refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall

them, and their doctrine, that men ſeeing they ſeek them not theirs,

for them, for the diſcharge of their places; you ſhall diſcover a new
world: Men by ſuch courſes which will bring on doctrine propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable,
will be ſo moved that cutting off each in his proportion
greatly, even their own ſuperfluous vanities, much more their ſins:
what our ſpirituall men may ſo have refuſed, with infinite more by
others thus cut off, may be diſtributed among the poore, (beſides

yet of proportion, leaving the leaſt in a tolerable mediocritie,
a golden age or primitive times may riſe againe in the world.</p>
            <p>But the way to this heaven is firſt to goe by the gates of hell, as
through the Parliament the Kingdome is made at by the true ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants,
ſo through or under colour of a pretended malignant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that ſeduceth or ruleth the Parliament, the Parliament or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
and dignitie thereof is attaqued, but ſure this is propounded as
an article of faith, and to weake reaſon paſt comprehenſion how it
can well be: but how ever they are misbeleevers and hereticks that
pertinaciouſly reject an article of faith, and with force to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
againſt; yet force being found oft none of the beſt wayes to
extinguiſh hereſie, but rather the canker ſpreaded and exaſperated
by rude handling, many have not and will not be deterred from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
ſuch as theſe, plaine or ſtronger oppoſitions, if any of this
malignant partie propound any thing (as in all great aſſemblies ſome
muſt breake the matter and begin) and the houſe conſent to the
propoſition; it is now the act of the whole houſe: if any propound
or ſpeake things that ſeeme to others offenſive, or to deſerve ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion,
and yet the houſe, or major part puniſh it not, they by
ſuch connivence (for theſe men may be allowed to queſtion ſtill
principles, that the Parliament would doe diſhonorably, and yet
come ſhort of their malicious intents) make it alſo this way their
owne; and ſo not theſe cenſors, or any els but the Parliament, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
appeared, is to judge of the Parliament; but ſuch cenſors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
are to be condemned by the Parliament, for thus preſuming
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:112518:18"/>
or aſſuming to themſelves the ſupreame power to judge; beſides par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
charges and articles againſt ſuch were to be offered to the
Houſe, the accuſers and witneſſes to be produced and forth-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
that if they make not good their charges, the parties unjuſtly
moleſted and accuſed, might have condigne reparations upon them;
and the Houſe it ſelfe ſatisfaction, the publique ſervice thus cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
interrupted, and the integritie of the Houſe called in queſtion,
and the like, appertaining to caſes of this nature. Such charges have
been promiſed long ſince ſhould ſuddenly appeare againſt the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Members of the Parliament, and by them as Juſtice earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
but appeare not all this while, not ſo much as to the people
abroad, (though this were not the right way) which they ſo ſtrive
to incenſe againſt the Parliament, but rather warre in ſtead of them;
and ſeeing ſo many of the very Members of the Houſes of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are their enemies, falling off from them unjuſtly (if none ſuch
ſtill remaine among them) were things appearing unjuſtifiable there
ſaid or done (if it might ſtand with the libertie and power of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
not to have libertie of ſpeech) it might eaſily be made appeare
in particular to the world, and ſo complaint be made to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thereof, if it were to any end to complaine there of that, which
hath already paſſed without puniſhment. But ſeeing the Parliament
hath power (the caſe ſtanding as before hath been ſhewed) to doe in
all things as they ſee cauſe; by good conſequence their ſpeeches ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
preparing, diſcuſſing, agitating, concluding what is ſo to be
done, cannot be ſubject to any limitting, queſtioning, or accompt
abroad, nor in reaſon therefore are to be divulged in that ſence; this
being incompatible with ſuch power. But then theſe haters of our
Law-makers and Lawes, ſay; Many of both Houſes are away, and
ſo the acts leſſe valid; but be the number remaining little, yet the
acts of the Major part of that number are ſtill good. For neither the
King that called them away, or countenanceth them that deſert
their ſtations, may ailedge this; nor the Members that voluntarily
(not upon truſt in thoſe that remaine, or leave obteined) abandon
their places there and duties, are to take the benefit, either of their
owne wrong, whether negligence in ſuch Members, or worſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
nor of their owne unworthineſſe, as Cowardiſe, to oppoſe
what they liked not: which feare (admitting ſuch could be) argues
ſtill that they that feared were the leſſer number; though what nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they feare to ſpeake freely, a diſſenting leſſer number being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
and ſometimes a very few, perhaps ſcarce enough to make a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:112518:19"/>
number, diſſenting openly from the reſt of the whole Houſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any inconvenience? It being allowed for any to ſpeake their
minds whilſt a matter is in agitation before it be ſettled. If they ſay,
they goe away that they may not ſeeme to allow what would paſſe
though they were preſent: then the Major part concurres to what
is done by their owne confeſſion, els why ſtay they not to oppoſe it?
If they ſay, ſo many are gone without leave of the Houſes, as put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
would make the Major part, ſuppoſing this were true, either
ſuch a Major part went away at once in a body, and then it was their
fault not to ſtay; for then they being the Major part had prevailed;
or they went by little and little, and then ſtill it was a Major part of
the remainder that concurred to what was done, els it had not paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed:
and ſo the acts ſtill good: If they fly to ſay that they who thus
deſerted the Houſe out of feare, did it not as fearing the Parliament,
but the people; granting theſe men this, which is not their due, that
ſuch had cauſe to feare the people, and that ſuch baſe feare, when as
they pretend, they were to ſtand for the King, Countrey, Lawes, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,
Religion, and did not render them utterly unworthy their
places: it may be anſwered briefly; they that remained and carried
matters, might feare the King as much or more: but their cauſe was
noble and good; but theſe or the like Cavils will no more hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winke
the people: their onely courſe were to produce ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
act of Parliament, that might certifie the world, that the King
and both houſes have long ſince unanimouſly concurred to diſſolve
this Parliament; elſe Sophiſtry will not carry it againſt the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
truth.</p>
            <p>By the premiſſes or rather by diverſe excellent Tractates publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
by others to the ſame, or the like effect, I hope it is even as cleare
that the Parliament is and ought to be the ſupreame Judge in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
matters now in queſtion in <hi>England,</hi> as what it is, it hath jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
and ordered touching theſe things, by ſo many publique orders,
declarations, and the like; and conſequently that reaſon wills that
they be ſacred in our eſteeme, and punctually obeyed and executed,
and ſo no need of warre: and whoſoever goeth againſt reaſon and
truth, goeth againſt God himſelfe, who is <hi>Prima, ſumma, pura ratio,</hi>
and it will concerne him nearely to looke to it, whether he be ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then God: goeth againſt himſelfe if he be a man, and ſhall firſt
finde a civill warre in himſelfe, before he can cauſe it in his Countrey
upon ſuch grounds, and for his Majeſtie he cannot as he is a King,
but judge that, that man thinks diſhonourably of him, who goeth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:112518:19"/>
about to perſwade him, that, that can be for his good that is not for
the good of his Kingdome, and ſo ſever what is ſo excellently joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
or that the great Counſell of the Kingdome is not the onely,
at leaſt the very beſt, and the onely ſure and ſecuring way without
all doubt, for that Prince to follow that intends the publique good:
and which will ever aſſuredly concurre with him to that end: nor
in oppoſing an arbitrary power, which ill men about him for their
owne private and wicked ends, would induce: Doth the Parliament
any thing but diſenable a Prince, or rather thoſe about him from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ill, or more properly from uſurping ſuch power; which to what
end is it in a good Prince, which he will or can never reduce to act
or uſe: but the falſe or pretended Mother of the childe, who would
have it divided, (whom the wiſdome of the King may diſcerne)
will whiſper, there is no thankes or glory to doe good, unleſſe he
might have done evill, and ſo did good freely; ſince free will onely
merits (I beleeve they hold merits) it ſeemes theſe malignants fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
not this Doctrine from heaven; for there we may finde that
confirmation in grace in the Angels and bleſſed ſpirits of juſt men,
whereby compleat free will, or the remaines of it (which free will
argues but imperfection and mutabilitie; power to ſinne being but
impotency, and the King of Kings, God himſelfe, who is perfection
it ſelfe, being above and without all power or poſſibilitie of doing
any evill, yet, (rather therefore I ſhould ſay) omnipotent in or for
good) that confirmation in grace, I ſay, by which free will is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured
and ſublimed into a ſtate divine; and <hi>Poſſe non peccare,</hi> into
<hi>non poſſe peccare,</hi> is a tranſcendent bleſſing, if not the very eſſence of
celeſtiall beatitude; where theſe ſuggeſt, ſuch a condition is to be
declined, though with ruine of all: But howſoever the Divines of
our times may not allow the explication or application of this point,
we may hope his Majeſtie out of his Princely care of the good of his
people, though both himſelfe and it may beleeve well of his good
intents to that purpoſe, will be far from judging ſuch a puntiglio of
arbitrary power (for however it may fill and tickle the phantaſie,
yet deeply and duely penetrated into by judgement, it appeares to
reſolve even into no more (if a puntiglio be any thing) or leaſt it
might poſſibly be thought, he would, or might have done evill, had
he not been reſtreined from it (when he cannot violate ſuch juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions,
without firſt doing the greateſt evill of all to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique)
from judging, I ſay, ſuch a puntiglio a juſt and ſufficient cauſe
to deſtroy the people by a civill warre; when were this power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:112518:20"/>
juſtly belonging to him, yet true love to his people might judge
it no other way uſefull, then to have the glory and thanks of relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing
it voluntarily, leaſt otherwiſe the peoples good and ſafetie
for a puntiglios ſake, or ſatisfying a phantaſie, or an humour of one
man, ſhould depend on the turne or change of one mans will, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it may happen, and more then this, great and noble minded
men, though no Chriſtians, have more then once done, when ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in their hands abſolute power over their Countrey (not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
gotten) they have freely and of their owne accord given it up
abſolutely, judging it ſo beſt for their Countreys good, leaving it
even in full libertie, and ſo living themſelves in, or rather under it,
but much higher in true glory and honour then ever. But though
ſuch power is not here in his Majeſtie, he is yet not without meanes
in his hands, and a faire opportunitie to lay a tye not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
on his people, and to exhibit freely great and publique munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
all at once, by a faire and voluntary relinquiſhing all conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
about it, whileſt yet a malignant faction, preferring their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
before reaſon, and conſcience, before his honour and ſafetie,
inſtigate and aſſiſt him as much as they can, or rather would make
him their inſtrument to compaſſe it by an unnaturall pernicious ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
warre, on whom the blame may juſtly be laid, as they alone
would have gone away with the benefit.</p>
            <p>By theſe and the like paſſages had beene, and even yet (ſo it be
betimes taken) may be the way to the true arbitrary power indeed;
the peoples hearts (where God begins with man, as at the right end;
this is the divine Method) which draw all the reſt ſweetly, which
the pretended falſe baſtard arbitrary power, could never by unjuſt
violence effect: and thus by fairely quitting the purſuite of the falſe,
the true may be gained: a magnanimous Prince, that confides in
his owne vertue, will put himſelfe boldly and ſecurely on the free
wills of his Subjects. It is in manner a divine Charecter; <hi>Scire, &amp;
velle liberis hominibus imperare;</hi> to know how to temper and governe
free men, Gentlemen, Princes; and in ſuch a condition God made
man, to ſerve his glory beſt: and is it not a more glorious thing
when a Prince ſhall by his great, proportionate, and heroike vertues,
render them at his devotion, and make them his voluntary ſlaves,
being otherwiſe free and noble, then if he found them made ſlaves
by the practiſe and vices of others, or ſo made them ſuch himſelfe.
Thus a free people is a ſtrong motive and occaſion to a Prince to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ender them wholly his by extraordinary vertue; the fall of this
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:112518:20"/>
emulous <hi>Carthage</hi> would ſhake <hi>Rome,</hi> though in oppoſition with it
and therefore the nobleſt of the <hi>Romans</hi> beſt and moſt wiſely loving
<hi>Rome,</hi> for <hi>Romes</hi> good adviſed <hi>Carthage</hi> ſhould ſtand. But reaſon
evinceth, that perſiſting as he doth, he remaines ſequeſtered from
all juſt power and authoritie, as touching the matters in queſtion
between him and his Parliament, on the juſtice and wiſdome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he may ſafely put himſelfe, ſecure, that they will not, nor can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
him of any thing, that juſtly belongs to him: onely reaſon and
right require, that it be left to the Parliament to be the Judge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
without which power, the people and Kingdome cannot be ſafe,
as ſtands deduced. Monarchy thus tempered by libertie and prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
as it is remote from intrinſicke cauſes of diſſolution, ſo from
externall. If a Prince governing at diſcretion invade it, the partie in
the goodly arbitrary government excluded by the diſtemper of ſuch
a State from the benefits of libertie (the partie, I ſay, for be a Prince
never ſo abſolute, yet his <hi>Mamaluks,</hi> his <hi>Militia,</hi> by whoſe conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
or tyranny he awes and enſlaves the reſt, not onely equall for
the moſt part in point of libertie, the Subjects of a free State, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
them far in all licentiouſnes and tyrannizing, and enſlaving
upon the matter the Prince himſelfe, as well as others, juſtly lay on
his owne ſhoulders by Gods judgement, that which he makes or u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
theſe as inſtruments to lay unjuſtly on the necks of his other.
Subjects, whom he ought to have protected: Inſtances are frequent
of the Pretorian Cohorts or Legions tyranny on the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
of the Janiſaries on the great Turke, of the <hi>Mamaluks</hi> on
the Aegyptian Soldans) and reaſon ſhews this danger is moſt to be
feared, where a Prince hath aſſumed the peoples libertie by publique
oppreſſion) I ſay, if the abſolute Monarch invade the juſtly tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the oppreſſed partie is not to be truſted, but to be kept under by
part of thoſe he will truſt, (he can truſt none ſafely) as certaine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
at home; ſo the power which he muſt truſt, doubly leſſened:
the partie uſed goeth faintly on the free Nation, for at beſt by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their free neighbours (whence was the chiefe hope of aſſiſtance
for the recovering their owne libertie) into ſervitude, they ſhould
but confirme and render remediles their owne ſlavery, encreaſing
the ſtrength of the oppreſſor, and likewiſe on the ſame reaſon reſiſt
leſſe, if invaded: Onely if the Prince will make accompt, or can be
content, or cannot avoid to be himſelfe an equall, a companion with
his Mamaluks <hi>(Facinus, quos in quinat, aequat)</hi> or rather to be tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
by them, and his honour, authoritie, name, perſon, to be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:112518:21"/>
made their inſtrument againſt his people, he may tranſlate the ſaid
faintnes from them on himſelfe; though when all is done, they are
unſafely truſted who have before broken the great tye, that to their
Countrey; elſe he muſt fly to forreigne helpe. But on the other ſide,
the free Subjects duely intereſſed in the State, loving it, living like
men, defend, invade the other, nobly, couragiouſly, as in heart, and
men of honour, and as oft for the good of the conquered; with
greater power, as univerſally to be truſted. Not to inſiſt on riches,
the nerves of Warre, infinitly increaſed by induſtry, ſo encouraged
by induſtry, loſt by ſervitude, but what needs more, or indeed ſo
much, if any thing in a matter ſo apparent? Wee now have beene
rapt ſufficiently into the goodly imaginary heaven, and the glory of
it, but with an hell of inextricable miſeries to the Prince and people,
which theſe Gods of the infinite prerogative pretended, are raiſing
for themſelves, through a government at will, but by ſuch meanes
and in ſuch manner, as ſhews they beleeve, or hope for no other
heaven hereafter.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being thus, it muſt follow, that thoſe that oppoſe the
Parliament, and in it the kingdom, in whom is the ſupreame power,
as reaſon hath evinced ſince conteſtation hapning as now between
King and people, the people muſt carry it, oppoſe their Countrey,
reaſon, right, and the truth, moved by defect of judgement, or worſe
principles; converting themſelves and their power received from
their Countrey to enable them to ſerve and defend it, to the ruine of
it, and of all that is precious to men of honour, and conſequently
that they are guiltie of their owne bloud, and of all the bloud and
miſeries which this unnaturall monſtrous warre may cauſe (a means
ſuitable indeed to the end they force themſelves to compaſſe:) nor
can unpartiall poſteritie judge of them otherwiſe, then as <hi>Parricidae
patriae,</hi> and <hi>damnatae memoriae,</hi> if all this be not of force with them to
deſcend deeply into themſelves, and to weigh whether they be in
ſtate fit for death every moment, at leaſt they may deigne this laſt
motive the honour of a deep and ſad thought, or two, whether thus
obſtinately perſiſting, they contract not before God another way a
guilt to contribute or be acceſſary to the endangering or perdition
of their owne, and innumerable ſoules in another kinde, and more
directly, and highly, there being <hi>aliquid ſacri in hoc morbo,</hi> and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
ſharing the hazard, as aboveſaid: but if the premiſſes have not
power to inferre thus much with them, yet I hope at leaſt they are
not ſo irrationall, ſo extravagant, as that theſe men can truely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:112518:21"/>
that they are onely to be confuted, and thoſe that maintaine
ſuch tenents to be inſtructed by a civill warre: but if folly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of that reaſon that ſhould governe men, or a violent forcing,
tyrannizing, and enſlaving their reaſon and conſcience by enormous
and monſtrous paſſions, and ſinnes, the two originall cauſes of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
be by no art to be ſevered from theſe men, but they muſt and
will by ſtill perſiſting apply theſe two ſaid generall cauſes of ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
particularly and expreſly, or in a ſpeciall manner now to draw
it upon them, it is not unlikely moſt of them, and their poſteritie and
friends may finde, and prove the effect as inſeperable from the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
thus redoubled and enforced, as the cauſes from themſelves,
ſhould they be ſo unhappy as to carry what they by ſuch meanes ſo
purſue: and however ſome dequoy indulgence may be uſed towards
them, to draw others, till all be in the power of the principall malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
(the like we may ſay of their cunning enforcing themſelves
not yet to declare all the depth of their malicious intentions towards
thoſe they diſarme, or any way get within their power, uſing them
as ſtaiking horſes, till by ſeeming for the preſent to leave theſe in a
tolerable condition, they may make others ſtand out leſſe reſolutely
or warily, and ſo drawing ſtill to them, make all ſure at laſt, and at
their diſcretion (though even whileſt matters are yet dubious, the
infernall are of malice, hate, crueltie, jealouſie, and the like, which
is in their hearts, ſometimes cannot but flaſh out in divers enormous
words, or acts) ſuch preſent indulgence, I ſay, notwithſtanding of
the malignant partie, let not theſe men thinke that it having all once
at its diſpoſe, and made ſure, will judge it may ſecurely repoſe on
ſuch of the Nation, as have violated wittingly &amp; willingly the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
tye on earth, by being traytors to their Countrey, or on thoſe
that loving their Countrey, have been violently or fraudulently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed,
or on them that not intending the diſſervice of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
but ſeduced by ſpecious pretences, have voluntarily aſſiſted the
malignant partie, when time and plaine experience ſhall have diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
theſe two ſorts, and afford meanes of redeeming their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
and themſelves, will not the malignants rather have recourſe to
forreigne protection, or forces (an uſuall refuge of an arbitrary, or
tyrannicall government, eſpecially ſucceeding and having uſurped
libertie of the Subject, as aboveſaid) under colour of being guards,
garriſons, auxiliary forces, joyned in league, or the like; as <hi>France</hi>
uſeth the <hi>Switzers,</hi> (the <hi>French</hi> Nation forſooth not populous or
warlike enough;) It is true, the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> though not governing at

diſcretion as the <hi>French</hi> uſeth the <hi>Switzers</hi> alſo, but not upon jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie
and diffidence of their own people (for ought I find) as <hi>France</hi>
doth, but for want of men or ſome other reaſon of State, and may
not many ſtrangers already here alſo be imployed; then may theſe
Zelots of the Malignants ſhare largely in contributing to the wages
of their forreigne Maſters, and be put to maintain their own ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
(as they ſtood to bring it in) with all their power. But God be
praiſed, theſe men unleſſe they ſpeedily come in and make their
peace, are on the point rather of falling under the ſword of Juſtice
in the hand of the Parliament: and it is not to be doubted, but God
himſelf whom they have by ſundrie paſſages too notorious (if we
may ſo ſpeak) made a party againſt themſelves, theſe Atheiſts
belike thinking he is grown old, and impotent, and cannot drown
theſe Egyptians in a red ſea of their own blood, if they with dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall
obſtinacie go on as <hi>Lucian</hi> that old Atheiſt ſaid of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan

will reſiſt, and defend himſelf, and his (were humane meanes
wanting) againſt theſe publique oppreſſors of the people in inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and endeavour, which they ought to expoſe their lives to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,
and protect.</p>
            <p>And for thoſe that ſtand alreadie for that Palladium of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Countrey, the Parliament, as they are herein duely ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of themſelves and honour, ſo out of the ſame feeling, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but ſo lively ardently and ſpeedily concurre with all their power
(if need require) when all their fortunes, and all that is dear to ſuch
men lie at ſtake (and which now nobly and bravely aſſerted and
vindicated, may for ever be ſecured, and the roots of dangers pluckt
up) that the <hi>Scots</hi> aſſiſtance be not the ſecond time needed (though
in all preſumption readie) it being the common cauſe) to our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
charge, nay diſhonour, as if others were more apprehenſive
of our honour then our ſelves, and we needed others to protect or
defend our Liberty, or take and manage our quarrels. And now
howſoever we may not ſhare in the putting a period to the diſorders
of the State, yet let us think of doing it to this diſordered diſcourſe,
wherein though there may not appeare manifeſtly one continued
beaten tracke of coherent paſſages, to bring you readily to the
truth: yet I hope you have incountred a few points here, and there,
not indirect, nor impertinent thereto; like Poſts of direction for

of old in direct oppoſition with it, on all which they are carried
with ſuch deſperate ardour and violent fury, as their utmoſt and laſt
attempt, that having firſt in a due method indeed uſed all machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to vilifie and difanull the authoritie and very eſſence of the
Parliament, the onely rampart of <hi>Englands</hi> happineſſe, and traverſe
to their deſignes, though God and good men have herein repulſt
them, yet they cannot temper themſelves, from breaking out into
ſuch effects as all the world ſees, nor brook any delay from ſeiſing
what part they can meet with of the deſigned prey, till they may
with leſſe danger of repriſall do it; but it is high time now to leave
words and writing: therefore let us endeavour to conclude this
Tractate, almoſt as indigeſted and troubled as the times (like that
offer of that poore Countrey man, that when the great King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi>
paſſed by, having nothing elſe to preſent him, before whom
none muſt appear emptie handed, ran to a little troubled water, and
thence offered the King what his hand onely could contain; but
the troubled preſent coming from a clear and good intention, and
native heartie ingenuitie, met with a ſerene, magnanimous, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
acceptance) but let us conclude with a point of Judgement not
altogether ſo weak as hitherto may have appeared; for I would end
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:112518:23"/>
at leaſt well and leave you with a good relliſh (though I appear to
begin this point alſo but ill) which is, that having above received it
as a ſacred truth and ground, that no reaſon ſhall ever ſhake, that
the wiſdom, and Juſtice of a Parliament freely, duely, and lawfully
elected is no way to be called in queſtion or doubt, but to be aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beleeved and confided in, ſecurely repoſed upon and held ſacred
and inviolable by all that heartily love <hi>Englands</hi> happineſſe: I will
take heed at laſt to be found not faſt and true to my grounds, and
ends, by preſuming (as ſome particular private men have done in
their we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l otherwiſe underſtood diſcourſes) to offer up any advice
(were I otherwiſe able) or counſell to the wiſdom, or exhortation
or perſwaſion to the Juſtice of it; and thus my beſt is but a negative,
a privative, or a nothing: but onely yet upon the whole, inferring
or enforcing juſtly by the power of truth; That it is the part of all
honeſt men, men of honour that love their Countrey to obey the
Parliament (taken in that notion our caſe preſents) punctually, to
ſerve it faithfully, and zealouſly; to love it with that kind of love,
which is <hi>morte fortior,</hi> to vindicate, aſſert, maintain, propugne, clear
the authority and ſafetie of it, as a true collection of all that is or
can be moſt deare, precious, and ſacred to, and with ſuch men, to
joyn unanimouſly in the clearing <hi>England</hi> once again of Wolves,
theſe man-wolves, if reducible by no reaſon, and not to looſe their
ſhare of contributing to ſuch a work; above all ardently to ſolicite
and preſſe the divine Majeſtie to inſpire, protect, bleſſe, this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
of Princes, this <hi>multitudinem Conſiliariorum in quibus eſt
ſalus,</hi> and in it our Countrey and all. I conclude this diſcourſe,
wherein I have ſpoken my heart, which nothing, but a lively and
deare apprehenſion of the imminent and extreame danger of my
Countrey, forced from ſo unfit a man; raiſing ſo violent but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
and juſt a paſſion, as brake the ſtrings of a tongue ever before
tyed (and perhaps ever fit to have been ſo you may ſay), like that
ſonne of <hi>Croeſus</hi> who before, or born dumbe, yet ſeeing his Father
in the very point of being ſlain, ſo naturall a paſſion ſupplying the
place and power of nature, or rather ſtronger then it, forcing and
clearing all impediments turning dumbneſſe it ſelf into a ſtrong
vociferation; he cried out aloud: Oh man kill not <hi>Croeſus,</hi> and ſo
notifying him ſaved him. I need not fear you think ſo well of me,
as that you would not remember that a ſimilitude doth not hold
throughout, and to the laſt, ſhould I not put you in mind ſolemnly
it doth not.</p>
