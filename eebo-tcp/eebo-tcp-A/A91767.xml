         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter written by maſter Symon Rodes, Miniſter in <hi>Yorke,</hi> To his Brother in <hi>London,</hi> With the ſubſtance of Sir THO: WIDRINGTONs (Deputy Recorders Speech of <hi>Yorke)</hi> to His Majeſtie, at his Entry into the Citie.</head>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Erhaps as the World is now come about, you may in ſome particulars be as glad of tydings from us, as we formerly have beene from you. His Majeſtie made his entrance into <hi>Yorke,</hi> on <hi>Fryday</hi> laſt in the afternoone, about foure of the Clock. The <hi>Mayor</hi> and Aldermen, with ſome others of the chiefeſt Citizens, meeting him a mile from the City; Where Sir <hi>Thomas Widrington,</hi> his Deputy Recorder of <hi>York,</hi> made a very worthy and ſolemne Speech unto him, and in ſome paſſages was ſeene to weepe.</p>
            <p>His Speech (by any expreſſion the King could be obſerved to ſhew) was not very well liked of him. The Speech, as neere as I could get a Copy of it, I have here ſent you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> tendred the Sword unto his Majeſtie upon his knee, and having kiſſed his Majeſties hand, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it of him againe, bearing it before him, through that part of the City, unto the Pallace.</p>
            <p>That night late the Earle of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> came in with ſome other Company; which Earle departed very early a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the next morning, ſome reported towards <hi>Hull;</hi> others, for the Biſhopricke of <hi>Durham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majeſtie had no extraordinary Attendance with him: What may follow, I know not. Here flie divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, ſuſpitious rumours, upon his Majeſties removeall ſo farre from His Parliament: That Diſcontent occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it, we all feare. God remove, in his good time, all Iealouſies from betweene the King and his people.</p>
            <p>There came on <hi>Thurſday</hi> night, a ſervant, or Meſſenger from Sir <hi>Iohn Haughtham,</hi> Governour of <hi>Hull,</hi> unto the Lord <hi>Mayor,</hi> being the night before His Majeſtie made his entrance. What the importance of that Meſſage did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne. I for my part am as yet wholly ignorant of: but it is given out to be ſomething that the ſaid Governour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the Lord Major to impart unto his Majeſtie, as touching ſome great charge he had lately received from both Houſes, as touching ſomething about giving entrance into the Towne; The reſt, Time muſt produce.</p>
            <p>Here are great feares about Strangers, <hi>Danes,</hi> and others, with a great Fleet that ſhould be upon the Coaſt, and to come for <hi>Hull,</hi> or <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> But I truſt in God, tis not ſo. Some Diſturbances, for certaine, are broke forth in the Biſhopricke of <hi>Durham,</hi> but whereupon, and what the true ground of it is, I dare not yet write, although it is heere in <hi>Yorke</hi> given out, that ſome of the Popiſh Partie there, doe not onely ſpeake, but begin to attempt ſtrange matters: One whereof is, That they will not part with their Armes, according unto the laſt Order of the Parliament.</p>
