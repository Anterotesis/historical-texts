            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN ſuch Aſſurance of the Fidelity of the Subjects to <hi>their Princes,</hi> as is a principal part of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>Monarchy,</hi> is, by the <hi>Gentleman</hi> whom I oppoſe, cenſured as new, needleſs, miſchievous, and impoſſible to be maintained; and for this an Appeal is made to the ſuppoſed ſenſe of the Repreſentatives of the Commons of <hi>England;</hi> equal Judges will think it but requiſite for one, from whom the greateſt Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have been, and are likely to be received, with Prejudice; to fly to the Protection of a Perſon, who, under <hi>their Majeſties,</hi> is at the Head of our Laws: Not for falſe and ſervile Gloſſes upon them, or a treacherous giving them up; but for reſtoring, explaining, and adorning them.</p>
            <p>Were it in my Nature to flatter, I am ſure here the Subject would free me from the Imputation; as my Incapacity to write upon it what I ought, may plead in excuſe of my offering at ſo little.</p>
            <p>This I may ſay, that ſince <hi>your Lordſhip</hi> is well known, not to have ſerved <hi>their Majeſties</hi> by halves, as if they had a <hi>Naked Poſſeſſion</hi> of the Throne <hi>without Right</hi>; no one Man's Diſability by an Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> can be lamented as a publick Loſs: Nor can any Example be more perſwaſive than <hi>your Lordſhips;</hi> whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:54552:3"/>
Judgment, and Integrity, no body is ſo ſingular as to call in queſtion.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly many, who would incline to think nothing of mine worth reading, may have the Curioſity to ſee, what it is that encourages my Preſumption in this Dedication; and the Hopes, that <hi>your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> who have ſo few Moments which are not taken up with the Affairs of the Publick, and doing good to Mankind; ſhould ſpare ſome time to look into what its Author muſt be ſuppos'd, to judge not unfit for <hi>your Lordſhip's</hi> View, and favourable Reception.</p>
            <p>And<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> indeed, my Lord! thoſe Memorials of paſs'd times which I here publiſh, and others which I refer to, have ſo long lain bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and unobſerved; and are of ſo great conſequence for vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>preſent Government,</hi> from thoſe Reproaches, which its Enemies pretend to found upon the Nature of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Monarchy;</hi> that I cannot but think, theſe <hi>Collections</hi> may be allowed the Honour of having a Patron, whoſe Approbation would effectually recommend them to the World.</p>
            <p>If <hi>your Lordſhip</hi> ſhall think well of what I here tender, in Proof, that the <hi>Right of their preſent Majeſties</hi> ought to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally acknowledged, and ſworn to, if required by Act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament; it will be a mighty Encouragement for me to publiſh at large thoſe Evidences, from the earlieſt times of this <hi>Monarchy</hi> downward, manifeſting <hi>their Right</hi> to be according to its <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Conſtitution.</hi> Which Province, tho many are more fit for it, has been aſſumed, and labour'd in, by</p>

anciently uſed; and, as I doubt not to prove, enjoyned by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of this Monarchy, and ſtill in force.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſiderer</hi> would be thought as true a Friend to the Engliſh Nation, and to our preſent Settlement, as any body; yet one may ſay, that the Cloven Foot appears, by the manifeſt end of his Book; and, particularly, by two Paſſages, when he was not upon his uſual Guard.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Theſe Notions are, like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Foxes, joyn'd Tail to Tail for the Deſtruction of the preſent Settlement.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Sure I am, our <hi>Conſiderer</hi> will have no reaſon to complain of any Injury, in being thought one of the ſame Principle, or rather Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, with a <note n="(d)" place="margin">

            <p>And yet, out of his great Concern for the Liberties of <hi>England,</hi> he would not have the Subjects <hi>Hurt by compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them</hi> to ſwear to an Authority, which,<note place="margin">

            <p>Tho' the Title of his Treatiſe relates only to an Oath of <hi>Abjurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which ſeems meant of an <hi>Expreſs Abjuration</hi>; His Arguments run againſt all <hi>implied Abjurations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vide <hi>Pag.</hi> 33.</note> which Oaths <hi>Declarative of Right</hi> plainly are.</p>
            <p>This might ſet aſide the Conſideration of the Head which he raiſes upon the ſuppoſed Impoſſibility of keeping ſuch an Oath: For, certainly, it is far from being more impoſſible to be true to Princes, whoſe Right we ſwear to, than to thoſe whoſe Right we refuſe to ſwear to.</p>
            <p>Tho' he will not allow of any manner of <hi>Abjuration</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 35. The other part of Abjuration is of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Government.</note> he ſeems particularly to reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome Form offered at ſome time or other; and yet is not ſo fair, or ſo diſtinct, as to give the Words at large, the rejection of which he would juſtifie.</p>
            <p>But, as he oppoſes all Oaths of Abjuration in general; his Arguments will appear to be of no Weight, unleſs they ſtrike at all ſuch Oaths, tho' relating only to the preſent time: As if we ſhould ſwear, which doubtleſs we may with a good Conſcience, when required, That <hi>James, lately King of England,</hi> has no manner of Right or Title to the Crown.</p>

            <p>What he ſays, therefore, in relation to future Contingencies, I might leave out of the Queſtion: As I might paſs by all his Pretences to skill in Hiſtory, upon the ſuppos'd Novelty of an Oath of <hi>Abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>: For if it be needful, it's being New, could be no Objection againſt it, with a Man, who, if he be what he pretends, has no manner of Scruple againſt Abjuring the <hi>late King's</hi> Title and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for the preſent.</p>
            <p>Beſides, if there never had been any Oath expreſly <hi>Abjuratory</hi>; if it ſhall appear that there have been Oaths <hi>Declaratory of Right</hi>; this would be enough to expoſe his vain ſhew of Reading.</p>
            <p>His chief Poſitions and Inſinuations are theſe:</p>

When that which ſecures all other Governments in the World beſides, and that which his ſecured our own as well as any other for ſo many Hundreds of Years, (<hi>viz.</hi>) An Oath of Allegiance to the Poſſeſſors of the Throne, will not ſecure, or be thought ſufficient to ſecure the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Government, on what Foundation will the World about us think we ſtand?</note> 
               <hi>all other Governments in the World:</hi> That is, never had been required here, or in any other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>For a ſeeming Proof of which Negative, in relation to <hi>England,</hi> it was but requiſite for him to make a great ſhew of being thoroughly read in our Hiſtories; ſuch an Undertaking becoming no Man who has not a comprehenſive Idea of the State of this Kingdom under all the Succeſſions of Kings. Nor, however, can he extend this Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation beyond his own Country, without aſſuming to himſelf the knowledge of the paſt and preſent Governments of all other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Tho', as I ſhall prove, he has been a very negligent or partial Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of the Hiſtory of this Kingdom; he would have it taken upon his Word, That no Oath of <hi>Fidelity</hi> was ever required of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>England,</hi> other than an Oath to <hi>the Poſſeſſors of the Throne,</hi> as Kings in Fact, without Declarations of Right: When yet, as he pretends to demonſtrate by an indigeſted heap of Quotations, there often has been as much occaſion for ſuch Oaths, as can be imagined now.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54552:5"/>II. He labours to impoſe the Belief, That an Oath of Abjuration, or barely <hi>declarative of Right,</hi> is needleſs; becauſe, as he will have it, there is as much Security to the Government from an Oath to a King, meerly as King <hi>de facto</hi>; and particularly in the Oath required by the Statute 1 <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> As from an Oath recognizing the Right of the Poſſeſſors, and abjuring the Pretences of others.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That an Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> or barely <hi>declarative of Right,</hi> would be very miſchievous: Becauſe, 1. It would be a means of deceiving the Government, and occaſioning the wilful Perjury of many; he uncharitably ſuggeſting, that thoſe his Friends, who take the Oath to their Majeſties, while they believe the Right to be in the <hi>late King,</hi> will as readily ſwallow <hi>Formal,</hi> as they do <hi>Material</hi> Perjury. 2. It will occaſion <hi>Diſtractions,</hi> and ſtrengthen the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> he unreaſonably ſuppoſing,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Page</hi> 31.</note> It will be the means of turning out a great number of good People, that ſerve their preſent Majeſties with Faithfulneſs, and Honeſty, and Diligence, and with Affection too.</p>
            <p>That is, who are in their Service, love their Perſons, and pay them all the Allegiance which they take to be due to a King and Queen in Fact: But if they ſhould be obliged to ſwear to their Right, muſt loſe the Opportunities they have of ſerving him, whom they contend to be their only <hi>rightful</hi> Prince; with much greater Advantage than they could without Power and Wealth from their <hi>Preſent Majeſties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. He maintains, that an Oath of <hi>Abjuration</hi> is impoſſible to be kept: Falſly ſuppoſing ſuch an Oath to imply a Fighting againſt God's Providence, and engaging never to obey the Perſon Abjured, tho' he ſhould be reſtored without their Aſſiſtance, or Connivance.</p>
            <p>In refutation of which his falſe Colours I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That an Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>Declarative of Right,</hi> is not <hi>New</hi> or <hi>Strange</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. That the Oath of <hi>Fidelity</hi> to our <hi>Princes,</hi> required by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of this <hi>Monarchy,</hi> is an Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> either expreſs or implied; and always as to a <hi>King of Right</hi>: And that the old Oath of <hi>Fidelity</hi> is more expreſſive of the Duty of the Subject, than the Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> required by the late Act; and that old Oath ſtill remains in force.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That in ſeveral Ages of this Monarchy other Oaths have been required, and taken by the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> beſides thoſe which were taken to the <hi>King for the time being:</hi> And that they are Oaths
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54552:6"/>
of the like Nature with thoſe which he will have to be <hi>altogether New and Strange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. That if there never had been an Oath of <hi>Abjuration</hi> before this time, however, this would be no colour of Objection againſt one now; for that it is more needful now, than it can be thought to have been in any of thoſe Reigns in which he inſtances: And that an Oath expreſly abjuring the late Kings Pretenſion, is now abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary: Nor is it to be thought that it would occaſion <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Perjury,</hi> but that it would prevent <hi>Material</hi> in many.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That it is likely to be of great Advantage, and Support, to the Government, and Nation.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That no Man ought to refuſe ſuch an Oath to their Preſent Majeſties, if required by Act of Parliament; and that it is not to be believed that the Refuſers would be conſiderable, in number, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Since he ſuggeſts, That the <hi>World about us</hi> would ſuſpect the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> on which we <hi>stand,</hi> if an Oath of Abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,<note place="margin">

            <p>Whereby, and by the declaring the Royal Dignity entirely and <hi>rightfully</hi> veſted in their <hi>Majeſties,</hi> it is manifeſt, that they not only recognized the Right of their Majeſties, but declared againſt, and renounced all manner of Pretences to <hi>Right</hi> in the <hi>late King.</hi> And they farther Promiſe to maintain and <hi>defend</hi> their Majeſties againſt hi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This, no doubt, is a good Foundation for an Oath of the like Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; nor can any man refuſe to ſwear to this Settlement, if required by Act of Parliament, but he muſt at the ſame time maintain the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54552:13"/>
Law, declaring the Right to be in <hi>their Majesties,</hi> to be no good and binding Law. And upon this Account, certainly, it was, that ſome have in a publick manner cenſured the declaring the Acts of <hi>their Majesties</hi> firſt Parliament to be good and binding Laws, as <hi>destructive of the Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Act of which I am ſpeaking, provides,
<q>That the Oaths hereafter mentioned, be taken, of all Perſons of whom the Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> gnd <hi>Supremacy</hi> might be required by Law, inſtead of them: And that the <hi>ſaid Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy</hi> be abrogated.</q>

            <p n="3">3. The Oath of Allegiance taken away by the Statute <hi>W.

And therefore, that Oath which was to be taken by them, who might not without a new Law be obliged to take the Oath of <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi> ſtill remains in force.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If it were not the meaning of the <hi>Law-makers</hi> 1 <hi>W. M.</hi> to leave the Common-Law Oath to the Crown, we muſt ſuppoſe, that they intended to ſet aſide the Security, which the Wiſdom of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers provided, in ſwearing all the Youth of the Kingdom to be true to the Government: For if the old Oath does not remain, no Oath of <hi>Fidelity,</hi> or <hi>Allegiance,</hi> can be required of any under the Age of 18. unleſs upon the account of ſome <hi>Office,</hi> or of <hi>Recuſancy</hi>;<note place="margin">3 <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 4.

But no man can reaſonably ſuppoſe it the meaning of the Parliament, that the generality of the Nation ſhall be exempted from giving that common Caution, or Security, to the Government, which had been required of every <hi>Freeman,</hi> or Youth, at the Age of 12, or elſe of 14.</p>
            <p>To proceed; inſtead of the Oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> firſt enjoyned by the Statute 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. The late Act requires only this Form:</p>

            <p n="1">1. As I before obſerved, <hi>Allegiance</hi> is only the cauſe or ground of Swearing to be <hi>faithful,</hi> not any farther Tie. And therefore they that think their <hi>Allegiance</hi> bound them only to ſwear to their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties as <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen, in fact,</hi> think themſelves not otherwiſe obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be <hi>faithful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is no Recognition of <hi>Right,</hi> which the Old Laws requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red fully enough, according to the ſimplicity of thoſe Times; and the <hi>Stat.</hi> 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1, required in expreſs Terms.</p>

            <p n="5">5. This ſeems to be of the nature of the Common-Law Oath of <hi>Fealty,</hi> by which Men ſwore to be <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and loyal</hi> to their Lords,<note place="margin">Vide <hi>the Oath of Fealty,</hi> Abr. of Statutes Ed Anno <hi>33.</hi> Hen. <hi>8. &amp;</hi> Littlelon.

               <hi>and Faith to them to bear.</hi> Where <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Loyalty,</hi> is plain <hi>Allegiance,</hi> or the Conſequence of it. Indeed it is not according to the <hi>Allegiance</hi> due to the <hi>King</hi>; and therefore the Law provided no <hi>Salvo</hi> to this Oath, for the Faith due to the <hi>King</hi>; as there was in <hi>Homage</hi>; that being of the nature of the Subjection due to the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England</hi>: Neither, as I ſhall afterwards ſhew, is the <hi>Allegiance,</hi> which many who take this Oath ſuppoſe to be all that is intended by it; the <hi>Allegiance</hi> due to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>Inſtead of the Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> we have this Form:</p>

               <hi>So help me God.</hi>

               </note> that neither this Government, nor any other in the <hi>World beſides,</hi> ever required more than ſuch an Oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> as he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to prove ſufficient.</p>
            <p>However, here are Four conſiderable Omiſſions out of the Oath of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> enjoyned 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which I leave to others to account for.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The former Oath requires Men <hi>utterly</hi> to <hi>teſtifie,</hi> and <hi>declare,</hi> in their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> that the <hi>Queens Highneſs is the only Supream Governour</hi> of this Realm, and of all other <hi>her Highneſſes Dominions</hi> and <hi>Countreys.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is nothing like this in the new Oath; which we can hardly call an Oath of <hi>Supremacy.</hi> I am ſure it is at moſt but a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Oath of <hi>Supremacy.</hi> But where the <hi>Supremacy</hi> reſts, is, to uſe a Law-term, left as it were in <hi>Abeyance,</hi> or in the Clouds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Oath contains an expreſs <hi>Abjuration</hi> of the pretended Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of every <hi>Foreign Perſon, Prelate,</hi> or <hi>Potentate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It requires Men to <hi>promiſe,</hi> that they <hi>ſhall bear Faith, and true Allegiance, to the Queens Highneſs, her Heirs, and lawful Succeſſors: and to their Powers ſhall aſſiſt, and defend, all Juriſdictions, Priviledges, Pre-eminencies, and Authorities, granted, or belonging to the Queen's High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, her Heirs, and Suceeſſors, or united, and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this <hi>Gentleman</hi> will ſhew me theſe Words in the new <hi>Negative Oath</hi>; or what import as much as they do, tho' ſworn to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties only as <hi>Poſſeſſors of the Throne,</hi> I ſhall be very thankful.</p>
            <p n="4">4.

               </note>Of the like nature with this, was the Oath of <hi>Obeyſance</hi> to <hi>King Henry</hi> the Sixth, the <hi>Queen, Prince Edward,</hi> and the <hi>Heirs</hi> of the <hi>King's</hi> Body.</p>
            <p>Tho' <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> Father of <hi>E.</hi> 4. had, according to the Modern Notion, the <hi>Divine Right</hi> of Succeſſion.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Nation did effectually <hi>Abjure Richard</hi>'s Pretences; he himſelf had done as much before, ſwearing in theſe Terms:</p>
            <p>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It appears farther in fact, that tho' <hi>Richard</hi> bore Arms againſt <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. he did it at firſt only out of pretence of redreſſing Grievances; but never laid Claim to the Crown as his Right, till he had <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. in his Power.

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:54552:16"/>But were there any queſtion, Whether the Oaths taken in former times for ſecuring the Succeſſions, agreed to by the <hi>States,</hi> or People of <hi>England,</hi> were in their nature <hi>Abjurutory</hi>; I think there is no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of doubt, but ſuch were Enacted more than once in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. when the Foundation of the <hi>Reformation</hi> was laid, and ſecured, by the Oaths of the Subject.</p>
            <p>And indeed, the Oaths of <hi>Supremacy</hi> are ſo plain <hi>Abjurations,</hi> and ſo great <hi>Securities</hi> to the Engliſh Government; that one would think, no body but one who <hi>cinſiders</hi> ſo little, or ſo much as on one ſide, as this Author, could maintain, <hi>That an Oath of Allegiance to the Poſſeſſors of the Throne,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Yet, ſince nothing but love to Popery, can be thought at the bottom of the Objections againſt our <hi>preſent Settlement</hi>; perhaps, this Gentleman may be one, who thinks no part of the <hi>Security</hi> of the Engliſh Government to lie, in maintaining the Supremacy of the Crown againſt the Uſurpations of the <hi>Pope.</hi> But for certain, <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments</hi> in the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> 8. judged it for the <hi>Security</hi> of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> that the Subjects ſhould be obliged to take ſuch Oaths, both in relation to the <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> and the Regal <hi>Supremacy,</hi> as this Author <hi>inconſiderately</hi> affirms,<note place="margin">Page 2.</note> to be <hi>altogether new, and ſtrange in</hi> England.</p>

            <p>It ſeems none of theſe Forms were found full enough to obviate the Evaſions of <hi>Subtile Swearers,</hi> and exclude the pretended <hi>Right</hi> of the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> And therefore 35<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
               <hi>H.</hi> 8. to the <hi>Renunciation</hi> of the Power of the <hi>See,</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Adjuration</hi> to the Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement made 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and then confirmed in the principal part, with ſome additional Proviſions; theſe words were added:</p>

               </q>

            <p>And it is obſervable, that tho' that Act continued, the Illegitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the Ladies <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> yet in caſe the King and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> ſhould die without Heirs of either of their Bodies, then the Crown was entailed ſucceſſively upon the two Ladies; but the Intereſt of either was to determine, if they did not perform ſuch Conditions as the King ſhould limit. And in caſe of failure of Iſſue, or in performance of Conditions, leſt the Realm <hi>ſhould be deſtitute of a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54552:18"/>
lawful Governour,</hi> the Crown was to go to ſuch Perſon or Perſons as the King ſhould appoint in the manner there directed.</p>
            <p>From which Statutes of the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. concerning Oaths to the Crown, and the Settlements of it, I may obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That when an Oath was appointed by due Authority, they who adminiſtred it were not always obliged to a ſet Form of Words, keeping to the Subſtance: as appears by comparing the Statutes, 25 and 26 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Oaths declarative of Right have been held uſeful and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, appears by the Statutes 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 7. and <hi>c.</hi> 10. By the firſt of which the Subjects were to ſwear the King to be <hi>Supream Head</hi> in Earth under God, of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And by the laſt they were to ſwear to <hi>accept, repute,</hi> and <hi>take</hi> the King <hi>ſo to be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That Parliaments have had the ſame Judgment of Oaths of <hi>Abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> is evident, by their ſometimes ſwearing to one Rule of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, then to another; contrary to that; and to defend that Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to which they ſwore, <hi>againſt</hi> all manner of Perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>And as theſe were implied Abjurations, they againſt the See of <hi>Rome</hi> were as expreſs as Words could make them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That, in the Judgment of thoſe times, implied <hi>Abjurations</hi> were as binding, as the Expreſs, is not to be doubted: Since it is certain, that it was the full intention of thoſe Parliaments to bind the Subjects to thoſe Settlements, without poſſibility of Evaſion.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That Acts of Settlement were thought to govern the Oath of Allegiance, and to make the <hi>Heirs</hi> to whom it was to be due, after the determination of the Intereſt of the then King.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That the Right to the Crown in Reverſion, or Remainder, was then held <hi>forfeitable</hi>; and determinable, even after Poſſeſſion, upon Non-performance of Conditions.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That if the Perſon, who, according to our <hi>de facto</hi> men, would have been King or Queen immediately upon the Death of <hi>H.</hi> 8. ſhould take Poſſeſſion of the Crown, contrary to an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſuch Perſon might be a <hi>Traytor</hi> to the Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="8">8. That ſuppoſed Baſtardy was held no Impediment to an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> or Settlement by Parliament, tho' it was to a Deſcent.</p>
            <p n="9">9. That it was not at that time thought, that any body in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, who could not claim under an Election, or Parliamentary Settlement, could be <hi>lawful King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. The Reaſon why the Authority of the See of <hi>Rome</hi> was <hi>Abjured</hi> expreſly, and that of the Perſon who ſtood next (according to what ſome think the ſetled Rule of Succeſſion) only by Implication, ſeems
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54552:18"/>
to be, that the Authority of the <hi>Pope</hi> was believed by many: But no one in particular was reputed to have a Right, contrary to what was ſetled in <hi>Parliament.</hi> And therefore there was no need to ſwear againſt it directly. And yet this was fully enough, in effect, when they ſwore a Marriage lawful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> while another to whom the King had been married, was alive, and had Iſſue to claim a Right of Succeſſion, contrary to the Settlement.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Tho' every Man was bound to defend the Settlements to the utte<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>moſt of his Power, it ſhould ſeem ſome Men thought themſelves <hi>exempted</hi> from defending with <hi>their Bodies,</hi> or fighting for either ſide: And therefore the Statute 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. adds the words, [<hi>with my Body.</hi>]</p>
            <p n="12">12. Notwithſtanding former Oaths, in ſome of which all manner of Attempts to alter the then Settlements of the Crown ſeem preclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; <hi>Parliaments</hi> judged thoſe Oaths to bind the Subjects only in their private, not in their Politick, and Legiſlative Capacity. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thought they might without ſin concur in the Repeal of thoſe Acts, againſt which they had ſworn never to attempt any thing.</p>
            <p n="13">13. If an Oath ſhould now be required, to maintain, and <hi>defend with their Bodies,</hi> the preſent Settlement of the Crown, againſt all perſons whatſoever; and to maintain the Incapacity of a <hi>Popiſh Prince,</hi> (who would promote the uſurped, and abrogated Authority of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>) to <hi>inherit, poſſeſs,</hi> or <hi>enjoy</hi> the Crown and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Realm; created, or declared, by the Statute 1 <hi>W.M</hi> who, but our <hi>Conſiderer,</hi> would ſay, That ſuch an Oath were <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Strange</hi>? when the Law 1 <hi>W.

            </p>
            <p>This hisbold Negative, I think I have ſufficiently diſproved: but would gladly know of him what he means by an <hi>Hereditary King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>

            <p>If he means, as without doubt he does, a Kingdom, where, of right, in all caſes, the Succeſſion ought to go to the next in the Line; and that every Interruption of ſuch Succeſſion, is contrary to the <hi>Conſtitution</hi>: Then I may ſay, and ſhall ſhew him in its place, that he knows nothing of the <hi>Constitution</hi> of <hi>this Monarchy</hi>: Which, as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Author long ſince obſerved of the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is in reſpect of <hi>Stock,</hi> or <hi>Family, Hereditary,</hi> as to Perſons, <hi>Elective.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if this has been the <hi>known Constitution</hi>; then Interruptions of the Line, provided the Family were kept to, could not require any other <hi>Abjuration,</hi> than what was contained in the common Law Oath.</p>

               <q>The Eſtates of the Realm, ſays he, <hi>Depoſed</hi> him very ſolemnly, (even without any notice taken of his Reſignation, tho' after he had made it) objecting ſuch and ſuch Crimes as <hi>deſerv'd it</hi>; which they might well have ſpar'd, and ſurely would have done it, even for pities ſake, if they had not intended thereby to exerciſe a Power they thought <hi>inherent in them,</hi> on ſuch extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here he not only owns, that the <hi>States</hi> at that time might judge ſuch a Power <hi>inherent</hi> in them; but that if <hi>R.</hi> 2. were guilty of the Crimes alledged, which is not now to be queſtion'd, his Depoſal

was juſt. And however <hi>R.</hi> 2. had reſign'd: And then, what need was there of <hi>Abjuring Richard?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he had withal remembred <note n="(a)" place="margin">The Statute which they referr'd to 11 <hi>R.</hi> 2. when they told him of an ancient Statute, by vertue of which they might abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate him, and chuſe anyone of kin of the <hi>Royal Stock Vide Knighton de R.</hi> 2.</note> that Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, with the execution of which they had ſome years before threatned <hi>R</hi> 2. he could not have queſtioned the Power of the States, but would have believ'd that they really had that Power by Law, which they thought <hi>inherent</hi> in them: And that <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. being of the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Stock,</hi> was duly and legally choſen in his ſtead.</p>

            <p>Where the only juſtifiable Reaſon for Poſſeſſors to deſire an Oath of Abjuration, with reſpect to any Competitor, which is the belief of their own Right, his Art would improve againſt one: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, no Man but this Author would think a Law for ſuch an Oath now, an Evidence that their Majeſties thought the right to be ſtill in King <hi>James</hi>; but directly the contrary.</p>
            <p>Yet, tho' his Premiſes ſpeak only of what the Poſſeſſors themſelves believed, his Concluſion is upon the general belief in thoſe Times: which will appear to run through all the Times in which he inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And then, according to his own Confeſſion, there was no need of an Oath of Abjuration in any of thoſe Reigns.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> having never been Crown'd, was never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>King</hi>: And himſelf had ſworn to <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. as the only <hi>Rightful King.</hi>

with his Arms; yet he was obliged to take up with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion after <hi>H.</hi> 6. as <hi>Hen.</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> did, after King <hi>Stephen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. When <hi>E.</hi> 4. afterwards claim'd the Crown, he did it not upon ſuppoſition that <hi>H.</hi> 6. had not been a true <hi>Legal King</hi>; but had broken the <hi>Contract</hi> eſtabliſhed in Parliament between his Father, himſelf, and <hi>H.</hi> 6. and was unfit to Reign: According to which the Eſtates adjudged the Poſſeſſion to <hi>E.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th's own Parliaments never held him to have been King, till the Eſtates had declared him King; notwithſtanding his Succeſs againſt <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.</p>

But he thought the Act of Parliament had ſecured him againſt the Family of <hi>Clarence</hi>; and therefore was regardleſs of them.

            <p>Is it not great Pity, that where he would be thought to write ſo wiſely, he wants not only certainty, but truth of Fact, and of reaſoning?</p>

            <p n="2">2. If one were King, how could both be ſaid to be <hi>depos'd,</hi> unleſs one lived ſome time after the other? Whereas they that ſuppoſe them murdered, will have both to have been murdered at the ſame time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He who reads <hi>Buck</hi>'s Hiſtory, would be modeſt in the Charge of Murder upon <hi>R.</hi> 3. and would impute the Death of one to ſome natural Cauſe, and might incline to think the other lived ſeveral years after <hi>R.</hi> 3<hi>d</hi>'s Death.</p>
            <p n="3">3. However, it is certain they were alive when <hi>R.</hi> 3. was Crown'd and yet his <hi>Parliament</hi> did not believe that they had any manner of Right.

            <p>That the Maxim here declared does not relate to the Right of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, but to the Act of aſſuming the Royal Dignity, with the Conſent of the People, is very plain. The Caſe of <hi>H.</hi> 6th's <hi>Readep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Power, after he had been diſpoſſeſſed by <hi>E.</hi> 4. and by his Parliament diſabled from holding the Crown, being brought as a Preſident for adjudging, that <hi>H.</hi> 7th's Aſſumption of the Royal Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity purged the Attainder he had lain under.</p>
            <p>What does this relate to the Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver King? Indeed it contains a great Truth, which was never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed in ancient Times; which is, That any deſerving Perſon of the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> was held a Perſon capable of being <hi>choſen</hi>; and from the time of his being <hi>choſen,</hi> and declared King, all Objections vaniſhed. That this could not relate to a Right of a Deſcent, but to a bare <hi>aſſuming</hi> the Crown, upon the <hi>Choice,</hi> or <hi>Submiſſion,</hi> of the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> or <hi>States,</hi> is evident by the Caſe then in queſtion; which was of a Prince, who was of a Baſtard Branch of the Younger Houſe. And tho' the Baſtardy had been removed by Act of Parliament, there was expreſs Proviſion, That the Capacities granted ſhould not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Inheritance of the Crown. Beſides his Mother, who if there were any Right of Deſcent, ſtood before him upon the Royal Line, was alive at his Acceſſion to the Crown: And if an Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had been no Objection againſt a Right of Deſcent the Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi>'s Children had that Right before him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:54552:25"/>And yet the Nation having generally declared for him, <hi>R.</hi> 3. was by Parliament adjudged to have acted <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rot. Parl. <hi>1</hi> H. <hi>7.</hi> n. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>traiterouſly</hi> againſt him, before he had been Crown'd.</p>
            <p>From all theſe Inſtances, theſe Three Concluſions are very obvious.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Oaths of Allegiance to all theſe Kings, were, as to the only <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>rightful Kings</hi>; and implied <hi>Abjurations</hi> of all others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there was no manner of occaſion for abjuring any one Perſon in particular; becauſe it was the ſetled Judgment of the Parliaments, and People of all thoſe Times, that no other Perſon beſides the <hi>King Regnant</hi> was King, or could be King, till he was admitted by the <hi>States,</hi> or <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That it was not bare Poſſeſſion, or want of Poſſeſſion, which made any Man more or leſs a King: For then <hi>H.</hi> 6. would have been the King after a <hi>Readeption</hi> of Power: And neither <hi>E.</hi> 4. nor <hi>C.</hi> 2. would have been the King, while either of them was out of the Kingdom: And every Prince would loſe his Authority, while Rebels are in poſſeſſion of the Power of a Nation.</p>
            <p>However, were it admitted that this <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s Account is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtably true, it would appear to any impartial <hi>Conſiderer,</hi> That he has left the Merits of the Caſe of an Oath of <hi>Abjuration</hi> untouch'd: for,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) His ſuppos'd Inſtances relate only to the Times when the Perſon, who, according to him, had the <hi>Legal Right</hi> of Succeſſion, prevail'd againſt the Competitor: But he offers not the leaſt Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Proof, nor indeed can he, That they who ſubmitted to the other, accounted him, even during that Submiſſion, not to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Legal,</hi> and <hi>Rightful King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As, therefore, it is to be preſumed (which alſo is true in fact) that they thought the Prince whom they obey'd the only <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Rightful</hi> Prince; if the Oath required to be taken to him were not thought ſufficiently to imply a <hi>Renunciation,</hi> or <hi>Abjuration,</hi> of the Pretences of every other Perſon whatſoever; they were not only guilty of an Error in Politicks, but of a great Sin, in not improving the Opportunity God had intruſted them with, for ſecuring the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) If the Oaths of Allegiance had this Defect; to this were to be imputed, the many violent Changes which have hapned in this Government: But,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:54552:26"/>(4.) Since the Oath was full enough for any honeſt Man; and, according to the Simplicity of thoſe Times: And yet the People ſometimes forſook the next of the Line, as well as the more remote; it is to be believed, that both the one and the other were deſerted by their former Friends, for ſome thing common to both.</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) It dos not appear in Fact, that ever any King of <hi>England</hi> loſt his Crown, meerly from a Perſwaſion generally obtaining, That the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> was no <hi>rightful</hi> King, as not being the <hi>Firſt</hi> upon the <hi>Royal Line</hi>; and that the <hi>Competitor</hi> had a Right to be the King, without any manner of <hi>Election.</hi> But the misfortunes of Princes have been imputable chiefly to ſuch Actions as amounted to a Breach of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi> between Prince, and People; or were taken ſo to be: Or to the belief of extraordinary Merits in the Rival, and proſpect of great benefit to the Publick by his Promotion. So that the Liberty which the People thought they had to cloſe with any opportunity of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting off the <hi>Poſſeſſor,</hi> has not been, becauſe the Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> did not ſufficiently bind them to defend the <hi>Poſſeſſor,</hi> while the Oath was in force; but that they thought themſelves really diſcharged from the Oath by the <hi>Poſſeſſor's</hi> Violation of the <hi>Contract</hi>; or the Superiour Law of the <hi>Publick Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">(6.) However it has been in former times, what the Act of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had made very plain, is ſo confounded by Men, who like the <hi>Pope, in order to Spiritual things,</hi> claim to themſelves a peculiar Right to interpret all manner of Oaths; that there is an abſolute Neceſſity not only for a Reinforcement of the Common-Law Oath of <hi>Fidelity,</hi> but for an Oath in expreſs Terms, declaring <hi>their Majeſties</hi> to be the only <hi>lawful,</hi> and <hi>rightful King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> of theſe Realms; abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the late King's Pretence of Right, and engaging Men to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> them to the utmoſt of the Parties Power, <hi>againſt the late King,</hi> and all other Perſons whatſoever. If any thing ſhort of this were ſufficient; yet if the Old Oath was <hi>Declarative of Right,</hi> and by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Implication engaged the Subjects to Fight for the <hi>Poſſeſſor,</hi> even <hi>againſt</hi> him who had been in Poſſeſſion, upon what, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our <hi>Conſiderer,</hi> muſt have been the only <hi>Legal</hi> Right; and if the preſent Oath mentions nothing of the Right of <hi>their Majeſties</hi>; and many who have taken that Oath, declare with this Author, that it is only as to <hi>Poſſeſſors</hi> of the <hi>Throne</hi>; This Omiſſion,<note place="margin">Page 30.</note> to ſay no more, gives too great Countenance to the Suppoſition, that they are not our <hi>Legal</hi> and <hi>Rightful</hi> Sovereign <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Lady.</hi> And it mightily concerns every one, who believes their Right, to vindicate <hi>their Majeſties,</hi> and the Settlement, from ſo foul an Imputation. Nor
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54552:26"/>
is it to be preſumed, that their <hi>Majeſties</hi> will reward Men for think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them <hi>Uſurpers.</hi> Here I ſhall ſhew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That they are thought by ſome only King and Queen in fact; that is, as thoſe very Men explain themſelves, meer Uſurpers upon the Right of a Prince, whoſe Right continues.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That both, according to the Men of that Notion, and to the Reaſon of the thing; no Man, while he believes them to be only <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>Queen in fact,</hi> can give any Security of being true to this Government.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he who ſhould refuſe to acknowledge the <hi>Right</hi> of their <hi>preſent Majeſties,</hi> and <hi>abjure</hi> the Pretenſion of the <hi>late King,</hi> if required by Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> ought to be accounted an <hi>Enemy</hi> to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That whoever will give this Security, ought to be reputed a Friend; till he ſhew the contrary, by holding or acting, as he had done before.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That even an Oath of <hi>Recognition,</hi> without an <hi>Abjuration,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought a ſufficient Security.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Preſent Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> who may be thought to trim the Notion of a King <hi>de facto,</hi> and dreſs ſuch an one up in the Cloathes and Figure of a <hi>King of Right,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. <hi>p.</hi> 14.</note> ſays,</p>
            <p>
               <q>In Hereditary Kingdoms, he is a <hi>Rightful King,</hi> who has <hi>by Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> a <hi>legal Right</hi> to the Crown: And he who has Poſſeſſion of the Crown <hi>without a legal Right,</hi> is a King <hi>de facto</hi>; that is, is a <hi>King,</hi> but <hi>not by Law.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To apply this, he ſays:</p>
            <p>
               <q>King <hi>James,</hi> more I hope, by following ill Counſels, than by his own Inclination,<note place="margin">Ibid. Page 48.</note> had effectually removed all Prejudices, and Objections againſt ſuch a Revolution; <hi>excepting the Obligations of Duty, and Conſcience.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So that according to him, notwithſtanding all that King <hi>James</hi> had done, in breach of the <hi>Contract</hi> between <hi>Prince,</hi> and People; as the Parliament plainly judg'd; Duty and Conſcience ſtill bind us to him. And he, as being the <hi>rightful</hi> Prince, ought ſtill to have continued the Poſſeſſion of the Throne.</p>
            <p>Then ſpeaking of Circumſtances making way for his <hi>preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>'s Acceſſion to the Throne.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Now, ſays he, not to diſpute the <hi>Legality</hi> of all this,<note place="margin">Page 49.</note> there was nothing ſo formidable as to prejudice an honeſt Man againſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54552:27"/>
and Compliance, as there was in the late Times of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion; nothing that could reaſonably hinder a Compliance, but an Opinion that we muſt never pay Allegiance to any but a <hi>Legal King.</hi>

            <p>
               <q>Before which he had laid it down as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule,<note place="margin">Page 26.</note> that <hi>a legal</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſive Right is the ordinary way, whereby</hi> the Providence of <hi>God</hi> advances Princes to any Hereditary Throne: And this bars all other Human Claims; but yet God may give the Throne to another if he pleaſes; and this does <hi>not destroy the legal Right of the diſpoſſeſſed Prince.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To me, I muſt needs ſay, here ſeems certainty enough to ground an Indictment againſt the <hi>Dean,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act 1 <hi>W.

            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Conſiderer</hi> knew too much Law to run this hazard; but we may conclude him to be of the ſame Opinion, not only from what he ſays of a <hi>legal</hi> and <hi>immediate Succeſſion</hi>; but from his Concern, that the Government ſhould look upon an Oath of Allegiance to <hi>their Majesties</hi> as <hi>Poſſeſſors</hi> of the Throne, while the <hi>Swearers</hi> hold ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have the Right; to be as great Security, as an Oath <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi> of their Majeſties <hi>Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That no Man, while he is of this Opinion, can give any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of being true to this Government, I ſhall make very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent:

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis a miſerable thing to conſider, how much men endued with Reaſon ſubject themſelves to others, who have nothing but Noiſe and Aſſurance to entitle them to a <hi>Dictatorſhip.</hi> But ſo it is, that when the Doctrine of our Church is to be learnt from its <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> and <hi>Homilies</hi>; the moſt forward of the Clergy uſurp an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Chair, and to diſſent from what they would impoſe, is enough to place a man among the <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Popiſh Doctrine of <hi>Probability</hi> ſeems improved by theſe men: And it is not only held ſafe to act as a few <hi>Great Doctors</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, but they who go upon other Grounds, muſt be thought not to <hi>hear the Church.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:54552:27"/>Wherefore, to ſhew how likely ſome men are to prevaricate, when they ſwear <hi>Allegiance</hi> to their <hi>preſent Majeſties,</hi> I ſhall fairly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent what Sacred Authority they would have, for impoſing upon the Government with an empty ſound of Words, which are made to ſignifie nothing, or very little.</p>
            <p>Yet I cannot but obſerve, that tho' the Notions are adopted by <hi>Church-men,</hi> they had a <hi>Lay</hi>-Father, which was that man of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal memory, Sir <hi>Robert Filmer</hi>;<note place="margin">Vide Heylin<hi>'s</hi> Certamen Epiſt. <hi>pag. 208.</hi>

Now here is a Queſtion which I am not Lawyer enough to decide, Whether a Commiſſion granted by a King out of Poſſeſſion, be a Legal Commiſſion? But be that how it will, I am ſure there is no Law which requires all Subjects to receive Commiſſions from the King, tho he be in Poſſeſſion.</note> he is ſo far from allowing it lawful to <hi>Defend</hi> the Kingdom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; that he too broadly inſinuates, That he may ſend Commiſſions, which ſhall oblige his Subjects to ſerve him, againſt the King in poſſeſſion; or at leaſt, which a man may lawfully act by.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The Judgment of <hi>J.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Page 7.</note> in his Apology for the Oath, that no more was intended by it, than bare Obedience; and that,<note place="margin">Page 13.</note> as he ſays in another place, <hi>no more than Paſſive.</hi>

            <p>Which being the avow'd and direct Conſequence of holding, that the Oath is taken to <hi>their Majeſties</hi> only as to <hi>Poſſeſſors</hi> of the Throne: The Inference is obvious, that when ſuch like Evaſions are found out, and ſpread; whereby Men think that they may ſwear <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> to <hi>their Majeſties,</hi> and yet retain <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the <hi>late King,</hi> as the only <hi>rightful</hi> King; it is neceſſary by a new Law to ſtop the Contagion.

               </gap>o man who holds <hi>their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties</hi> to have a Poſſeſſion, contrary to Right, remaining in King <hi>James,</hi> can give reaſonable Security of <hi>Fidelity</hi> to <hi>their Majeſties</hi>; eſpecially that the preſent Form of Words pronounced by them yields none, may very eaſily appear from the nature of the thing: For,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:54552:32"/>1. No man can be of the Opinion that they are only <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen in fact,</hi> but upon thoſe Grounds which carry ſome of our <hi>High Church men</hi> to ſwear <hi>Allegiance</hi> to <hi>their Majeſties,</hi> barely as Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of the Throne, and others of them not to Swear: but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Opinion of both Diviſions of that Party, they cannot be obliged to do any thing in the Service of <hi>their Majeſties,</hi> to the real Prejudice of their King of Right: Or if they have, they are bound to repent of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tho' ſome Perſons of Art and Abilities to delude, may have permiſſion to take the Oaths to <hi>their Majeſties</hi>; it is not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed that the <hi>late King</hi> would conſent that theſe Oaths ſhould be generally taken, leſt People who underſtand not Subtilties ſhould think themſelves obliged, by vertue of that Conſent, to ſerve their <hi>Majeſties,</hi> according to the true import of the Oath. And indeed the late King's Declarations take off all Colour from ſuch Preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: So that the <hi>Non-ſwearers</hi> have a great Advantage in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt the other <hi>de facto</hi>-men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Tho' Dean <hi>Sherlock</hi> in ſome places holds the <hi>rightful King</hi> out of Poſſeſſion not to be King, and ridicules Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi>'s Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his preſumed Conſent, for a ſort of ſubmiſſion to the Rival; yet he manifeſtly allows, at leaſt does not deny, ſuch an Authority to remain in the <hi>diſpoſſeſſed Prince,</hi> as he could not have otherwiſe than as King. For he not only affirms, that he has Right to make War, which he muſt not by his Principles yield to any Subject; but makes his Perſon irreſiſtible, and ſtrongly intimates his Opinion of the Legality of his Commiſſions, eſpecially when his Power is <hi>formidable.</hi> If therefore any Authority remain in the Diſpoſſeſſed King, either two <hi>Rival Kings</hi> may be inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted with Regal Authority,<note place="margin">Caſe of Alleg. <hi>pag.</hi> 14.</note> which he abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely denies: Or elſe, if there be any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Commands of the King <hi>de facto,</hi> it muſt lie in the <hi>preſumed Conſent</hi> of the other.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He muſt yield this at leaſt, in one Caſe of a <hi>Prince's</hi> being kept from the poſſeſſion of his Right; which is, when an Uſurper ſteps into the Throne before the Prince, who, according to Men of that Notion, is King before Poſſeſſion, could aſſume the Enſigns of Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, which, according to them, was the Caſe of <hi>Robert,</hi> the Eldeſt Son of <hi>W.</hi> 1. upon the Poſſeſſion of <hi>W.</hi> 2. and <hi>H.</hi> 1. Of <hi>Maud</hi> up on the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Stephen:</hi> Of Prince <hi>Arthur</hi> upon the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of King <hi>John,</hi> and ſo downwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:54552:33"/>This in direct Conſequence would extend to the preſent Caſe, when, according to him, a King <hi>de facto</hi> has, contrary to the Laws of this Realm, diſpoſſeſſed a King <hi>de jure,</hi> who, ſuitably to the <hi>Dean</hi>'s Expreſſions,<note place="margin">Page 49.</note> tho' he <hi>left the Crown and Kingdom in a fright,</hi> is not to be thought to have renounced all <hi>future Right and Claim to it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since, therefore, he is ſo far from giving colour to this Preſumption, that he publickly claims the Crown, and commands all the Subjects of this Monarchy to aſſiſt him againſt their <hi>preſent Majeſties</hi>; they who believe him to be <hi>King,</hi> and yet would ſwear <hi>Allegiance</hi> to <hi>their Majeſties</hi>; in whatever Form of Words they ſwear, as they believe the Regal Authority to be legally and rightfully veſted in the late King only, muſt be ſuppoſed to intend to do nothing in purſuance of that Oath, beyond what they can have <hi>King James</hi>'s Authority for.</p>
            <p>Nor muſt the <hi>Dean</hi> think to evade this Conſequence, when all that he retracts of his <hi>Caſe of Reſiſtance,</hi> is his former Aſſertion, that when St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>All Power is of God,</hi> he means only <hi>Legal Powers.</hi> But that, in an <hi>Hereditary Monarchy, where the right Heir is living, Uſurped Powers,</hi> are not of God.</p>
            <p>I am ſure he no where retracts another as poſitive Aſſertion, That <hi>the Sovereign Power which makes Repeals, and diſpenſes with Laws,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caſe of Reſiſtance, <hi>pag.</hi> 199. &amp; 200.</note> 
               <hi>is inſeparable from the Perſon of the Prince.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to which, 1. The late King could do no Act which amounted to the Breach of the <hi>Contract;</hi> and ſo bare <hi>Abdication,</hi> or <hi>running away in a fright,</hi> is all the Foundation which would remain for the preſent Settlement.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This <hi>inſeparable Sovereignty</hi> continuing in the Perſon of their <hi>Rightful Prince,</hi> their Majeſties muſt upon this Principle act under the late King's Authority, or without any at all.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This ſhews, beyond Contradiction, that they who would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to <hi>Recognize</hi> the <hi>Right</hi> of their <hi>preſent Majeſties,</hi> and to <hi>Abjure</hi> the late Kings Pretenſion, are to be accounted Enemies to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, notwithſtanding all that our <hi>Conſiderer</hi> offers to clear them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>A new Oath, he ſays, will only affect ſuch as have taken the Oath of Allegiance,<note place="margin">Page 28. &amp; 29.</note> 
                  <hi>bona fide,</hi> and kept it very honeſtly. And is it likely, that they who have done ſo, ſhould be Enemies to the Government?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:54552:33"/>Now this will not concern our preſent Queſtion; unleſs theſe are Men who would refuſe to take an Oath of <hi>Recognition</hi> and <hi>Abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> by reaſon of the Belief that <hi>King James</hi> remains the <hi>rightful King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore that Belief carries with it as great a Reflection upon the preſent Government as its greateſt Enemies can invent; and if farther, it diſables them from ſerving the Government, and paying that <hi>Allegiance</hi> which is due to it: They (upon the known Rule, when the Exigences of Affairs require Aſſiſtance and <hi>Defence</hi>) as they are not for the <hi>Government,</hi> muſt be reputed againſt it.</p>
            <p>I may add, as another Rule, that whoever denies to pay their Majeſties that Allegiance, which the Conſtitution of this Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy requires to be paid to the <hi>Sovereign Lord</hi> and <hi>Lady for the time being,</hi> muſt be <hi>Enemies</hi> in the Eye of the Law; unleſs, being Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, they are rather to be accounted Traitors. But no Man who ſwears Allegiance to them, while he believes the late King to be the <hi>Rightful Ring,</hi> can pay them the Allegiance due to them by the Conſtitution; that requiring Allegiance, upon the Account of a <hi>preſumed</hi> Right in the <hi>Poſſeſſor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which puts this matter beyond all Queſtion, is, that every Man is to be ſuppoſed to act according to his Principles; but no Man can be led by any Principle to believe the <hi>late King</hi> to have the Right, who will not by the ſame Principle be obliged to do him Service; that is, pay him Allegiance whenever it is in his Power: Tho' ſometimes, as Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi> has it, <hi>the Exerciſe of Allegiance</hi> may be <hi>ſuſpended</hi> by reaſon of a prevailing Force.</p>
            <p>How far ſoever theſe men may juſtifie their Swearing to their <hi>preſent Majeſties, bona fide,</hi> according to the perſwaſion of their own minds, they cannot be ſaid honeſtly to have kept the Oath: For if they have kept the Oath, they have acted contrary to their Belief: If they have acted according to their Belief, they have not kept the Oath.</p>
            <p>Oh! but ſays our <hi>Conſiderer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 29.</note>
               <q>The Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power impoſed the Oath of Allegiance on the Subject, and intended it for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and Eſtabliſhment of the Preſent Government: The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject takes the Oath, and keeps it faithfully; how is he then an Enemy?</q>
            </p>
            <p>If he who believes King <hi>James</hi> to have the Right, tho' the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment declared the Regal Power to be <hi>rightfully</hi> veſted in their preſent Majeſties, can be thought to have taken the Oath in that Sence in which the Parliament intended it for a Security, this were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54552:34"/>
And yet, if the Parliament might at that time think there was no need of having the Oath as expreſs as the Act of Settlement, or implying as much, and ſhould afterwards find a neceſſity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding againſt a ſpreading Evil, of which they were not then ſo ſenſible; they who have manifeſted their Oppoſition to the Grounds of the Settlement, if they ſhould refuſe to give that reaſonable Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, would be no leſs Enemies, for having before given what they cannot be thought ever to have intended for a real Security.</p>
            <p>Since he thinks himſelf very lucky in his Similies, I muſt not paſs by that which he brings upon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <q>My Friend, ſays he, deſires me to walk a Mile with him,<note place="margin">Page 29.</note> to conduct him through ſuch a thieving Lane, and I conſent; and when he comes to the Miles end, his Fears grow greater, and he deſires me to walk another Mile; but I tell him, It is late, and I can go no further without Inconveniency, and Danger to my ſelf; and for this he quarrels with me, and accounts me his Enemy. I leave you to judge with what reaſon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Apply but his own Inſtance to the preſent Caſe, and the Reaſon will appear undeniable: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He admits the Caſe to be of two Perſons, whoſe Ways and Intereſts are divided; that is, one for King <hi>James,</hi> while the other is for their <hi>preſent Majeſties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſuppoſes that the <hi>Jacobite</hi> went with the <hi>Williamite</hi> as far as he could, with his own <hi>Conveniency,</hi> and without <hi>Danger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That there is yet more Danger. This Danger he muſt not, by his Principles, ſhare with the other, eſpecially when it is ſo <hi>late,</hi> that the utmoſt time which has been allowed to keep along with the <hi>Williamite</hi> is expired.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is therefore natural to conclude, that this Man is one of that Party from whence the farther Danger is to be feared.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And upon that Account the <hi>Williamite</hi> ought in the firſt place to ſecure this Man from doing him any Miſchief; by his Oath, as full as Words can make it, if he is a Man thought to make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of an Oath; if not, by diſlabling him from adding to the Danger.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To apply this Inſtance to the preſent Caſe.</p>
            <p>If a Man ſlightly Arm'd, travelling upon a dangerous Road, ſhould meet with ſeveral Paſſengers who had been rob'd, and made ſuch a Deſcription of the Theives, that upon the firſt approach of ſome Men well mounted, every one of the Fellow-Travellers ſhould be ſatisfied that they were part of the Gang who committed the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54552:34"/>
Robberies: And yet, tho' the Travellers were ſuperiour in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and Courage, they ſhould be ſo generous as to truſt the others with their Arms, upon an Oath, that they would never ſet upon them till they were joyn'd by the reſt of their Party; Would not this argue a ſtrange ſort of Generoſity in them, who ſhould take ſuch a ſlight Security?</p>
            <p>It muſt not be ſaid that this is not the preſent Caſe, in relation to the Oath of Allegiance; ſince theſe men profeſs, that they intended to pay no other <hi>Allegiance,</hi> than what is due to a King ba<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely as <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor.</hi> Nor can the Import of the Word <hi>Allegiance</hi> ever convince them who are reſolved never to own, that <hi>Allegiance,</hi> according to the Conſtitution, implies an acknowledgment of the <hi>Right</hi> of the <hi>Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor,</hi> and a Renunciation of all Pretenders; as it engages the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the <hi>Defence</hi> of their Prince againſt all men whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. But whoever will take an Oath in ſuch a Form, as leaves no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for evading the Common Law-meaning of the Oath of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ought to be accounted a Friend till the contrary appear: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a common Preſumption, that Men will not <hi>wittingly, and willingly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Caſe, <hi>p.</hi> 28.</note> 
               <hi>and with an evil mind,</hi> forſwear themſelves.</p>
            <p>Tho' this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> to ſerve his purpoſe, takes a Liberty with his Friends; it is by no means to be ſuppoſed, that any Man who ſhould in expreſs Terms ſwear to the Right of <hi>their Majesties</hi>; that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the <hi>former King</hi> to have no Right; and that he will to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of his Power defend the Perſons and Right of <hi>their Majesties</hi> againſt him; ſhould, notwithſtanding this Oath, believe that <hi>their Majesties</hi> have no Right, but that the Right is in the <hi>late King,</hi> and that it were unlawful to defend <hi>their Majesties</hi> againſt him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is certain, the Conſent of the <hi>late King</hi> to ſuch an Oath is not to be preſumed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If it were actually given, the Oath could not but be thought to bind, according to the plain meaning of the Words: <hi>God</hi> being called as a Witneſs and Party to a Renunciation of that very Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Equivocation, with which, otherwiſe, Men would think to juggle.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Queſtion being of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> who take this Oath; the Doctrine of mental Reſervations, or the Diſpenſation of any other <hi>Superiour,</hi> beſides them who enacted the Oath, cannot be thought to take place here.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:54552:35"/>II. Tho' I will admit, that there are Exceptions to be made to the general Rule and Preſumption in this Caſe; becauſe thoſe <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</hi> who pretend to be the only Men fit for Employments, muſt not be thought ſo weak, as not to ſee through all the Evaſions which <hi>Clergy-men</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or others, have found out to elude the meaning of the preſent Oath; and therefore it muſt be yielded, that they break it <hi>wittingly and willingly</hi>: Yet the Rule holds good in the General; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe moſt Men are to be preſumed to have regard to their Oaths, when there can be no doubt of the meaning. Nay, even thoſe Men who cannot but know, that they break the Oath which they have taken to <hi>their Majeſties,</hi> would not be likely to break a plain Oath of Abjuration: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Tho' their Biaſs may lean to thoſe Interpretations of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Oath, which ſtifle their Convictions; no Evaſion for ſuch an Oath having yet been invented, their Conſciences would ſo ſtare them in their Faces upon the apparent Violations of ſo ſolemn a Tie, that it is not to be thought they durſt venture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Men who would venture Damnation to perjure themſelves, would not do it in ſuch a manner, that the World muſt pronounce them wilfully perjured. As Sir <hi>John Denham</hi> well obſerves,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vide</hi> his admirable Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em on <hi>Cooper</hi>'s Hill.</note>
               <q>
                  <l>Who fears not to do ill, yet fears the name;</l>
                  <l>And free from Conſcience, is a Slave to Fame.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Temptations for breaking ſuch an Oath would be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Neither could the <hi>late King</hi> truſt 'em after ſuch an Oath againſt him; nor if he did, could they have any Reputation or Party wherewith to ſerve him to any purpoſe, or render themſelves worth courting.</p>
            <p>No Man, whatever his Talents may be, can be a great Man as he ſtands alone.</p>
            <p>They who ſwear to <hi>their Majeſties</hi> as <hi>King and Queen in fact,</hi> have hitherto maintained their Reputations with a bigotted <hi>Party,</hi> upon that Doctrine of Probability before obſerv'd, which makes the Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with which the preſent Oath is taken, to paſs for the Church-ſence. But ſince there can be no Proteſtant Church-Cover for bare-fac'd Perjury; they who ſhould take a full Oath of <hi>Recognition</hi> and <hi>Abjuration,</hi> and yet act as if they believed <hi>the late King</hi> ſtill to have the Right, muſt no longer pretend to be <hi>Proteſtants</hi>; and by being
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:54552:35"/>
neceſſitated to pull off that Mask, under which they have ſerved Popery, will become uſeleſs, and deſpicable.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As ſuch an Oath as is propoſed would be an effectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of <hi>King James</hi> and his <hi>Party</hi>; Intereſt, which has ſo long had the Aſcendant over theſe Men, would be an Argument for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, who ſhould take ſuch an Oath, to ſtrengthen and ſupport himſelf among them, who receive him upon this Teſt.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) Tho' the Suppoſition, That the <hi>late King</hi> ſtill <hi>remains King,</hi> or has Right <hi>to be King,</hi> has no real Foundation in Law, Reaſon, or the Authentick Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England</hi>: Yet ſome Men are for maintaining, that he ſtill has the Right, meerly becauſe they have held ſo hitherto. But as in abjuring the ſuppoſed Right, they would own themſelves to have been in an Error; Since they could not have the Glory of Perſeverance, they would, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, be driven to the Honeſty of Repentance.</p>
            <p n="5">V. But it will be ſaid, What need would there be of an Oath of Abjuration, if there ſhould be an Oath recognizing the Right of <hi>their preſent Majeſties?</hi> Would not this ſufficiently imply, that the <hi>late King</hi> has no Right?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If it does, then, certainly, whoever would proffer to take an Oath of <hi>Recognition,</hi> and yet refuſe an Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> would make the laſt neceſſary by his Refuſal; as it would argue that he has ſome hidden Reaſon for his Refuſal; and therefore did not mean honeſtly when he proffer'd the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Refuſal of an Oath of Abjuration muſt be preſumed to be grounded upon a Perſwaſion, that the <hi>late King</hi> has Right: And therefore, whether this is really conſiſtent with the Belief, That <hi>their Majeſties</hi> have Right, or no, is not very material. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</p>

            </p>
            <p>Since when he had taken the utmoſt time to conſider of this Point of Law, he would not determine againſt the Legality of ſuch a Commiſſion, all the Implications in his Firſt Book, of his Opinion for the Legality of them, remain.</p>
            <p>And it muſt be remembred, that he had there aſſerted poſitively,<note place="margin">Caſe of Allegiance.</note> That <hi>Loyal Subjects ought chearfully</hi> to ſerve their <hi>Prince</hi> in an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> which he <hi>may</hi> raiſe for <hi>his Defence when he is out of Poſſeſſion.</hi> And then I think it can be no great Queſtion, whether they ought not to act under his <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> when required by him.</p>

A Legal Title to the Crown, and a Legal Authority, may be ſeparated; that he who has the Title, may not have the Legal Authority, nor be the Legal King.</note> 
               <hi>Legal Authority</hi> to adminiſter the Government, while he admits that the <hi>late King</hi> has a <hi>Legal Title,</hi> ſeparate from that <hi>Authority</hi>: But this Authority of the <hi>States</hi> he limits to a <note n="(b)" place="margin">Page 7.</note> 
               <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy</hi>; or, as he explains himſelf, where <note n="(c)" place="margin">Page 11.</note> 
               <hi>there is no Monarch actually in the Throne</hi>: and the Power of Judging or Declaring, he allows not to go farther than for the <note n="(d)" place="margin">Page 7.</note> 
               <hi>next Heir.</hi> He ſays farther, in a particular Caſe, by way of a General Rule, <hi>That where the undoubted Heirs to the Crown, by a Lineal Succeſſion, are unjuſtly kept from their Right, Subjects are bound to do them right, by placing them on the Throne.</hi> So that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Suppoſe the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> were wholly out of Queſtion; yet if his Majeſty has his Crown otherwiſe than in the Right of <hi>her Majeſty,</hi> he would not be a <hi>Legal King</hi> in this Author's Sence, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that he ſays to make us believe, that he thinks <hi>his Majeſties</hi> Authority <hi>Legal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. If the <hi>late King</hi> ſtill retains a Right; whatever Legal Authority <hi>their Majeſties</hi> may have, the People, according to him, are bound to do King <hi>James</hi> right, by placing him upon the Throne. And what he ſays of their having anſwered the Law of Succeſſion,<note place="margin">Page 7.</note> in placing him formerly upon the Throne, is a meer Evaſion; it not coming up to what is due to a continuing Right, whether of Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before Poſſeſſion, or of Reſtitution afterwards: And, certainly, it is Nonſence to ſuppoſe, that I am obliged to put a Prince into
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:54552:37"/>
Poſſeſſion, if an Uſurper got in before him; but not if the Uſurper came in upon the diſpoſſeſſing him.</p>
            <p>As he ſuppoſes the Throne to have been no otherwiſe vacant, than by an <hi>Abdication</hi>; this will plainly reſolve its ſelf into Dean <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Notion of <hi>Degrees of Settlement,</hi> according as the <hi>Abdicating Prince</hi> is more or leſs formidable, or intent upon purſuing his ſuppoſed Right. And thus he who is thought to have diveſted himſelf of his Sovereignty, when he left the Nation, without conſtituting any body to govern in his Abſence; may be ſaid to have reaſſumed his Royal Dignity, by granting Commiſſions to a ſtanding <hi>Council,</hi> or to any particular Perſons to manage his Intereſt. Which is the direct Conſequence of dividing the Breach of the Contract from the <hi>Abdication</hi>: For if no regard be had to the breach of that, <hi>J.</hi> 2. would continue as Legal a King as <hi>C.</hi> 2. was, during the late Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
            <p>And whatever Allegiance the <hi>de facto</hi>-men ſhould ſwear to <hi>their Majesties,</hi> and intend to pay while the Strength of the Nation were in other Hands; it is little leſs than Demonſtration, that unleſs they ſwear <hi>their Majeſties</hi> have the Right excluſive of King <hi>James</hi>; the preſent Government cannot be ſecured of their Allegiance: becauſe by their Principles, if they get into Power to turn the Scales, they are obliged to recall <hi>their King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I conceive, may be enough to ſhew the abſolute Neceſſity of an Oath, whereby Men may not only recognize the Right of <hi>their preſent Majesties,</hi> but abjure the pretended Right, or Title, of the <hi>late King</hi>; which no man can do, while he, with that ſubtile Author whom I laſt cited, ſeparates the <hi>Legal Authority</hi> from a <hi>Legal Title.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. That they who take the preſent Oath to their Majeſties, while they ſuppoſe the Right to be in the <hi>late King,</hi> are guilty of material Perjury, would be no Queſtion to any body, who does not take Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> and other Caſuiſts of that Stamp, for Oracles.</p>
            <p>The Biſhop all along ſuppoſes, that Allegiance was due to <hi>C.</hi> 2. during the late Times of Uſurpation; and yet, that men might promiſe to be <hi>true and faithful</hi> to the then Powers, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entring into any Obligation, <note n="(a)" place="margin">Caſe of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, p. 102.</note> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their Allegiance to <hi>C.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>His chief Reaſons are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <note n="(b)" place="margin">Page 110.</note> Abſenc of Words incapable of a Conſtruction binding to leſs than the Allegiance due to Governours <hi>de Jure.</hi>

               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:54552:38"/>2.
<q>That the Impoſers intending by the Engagement to ſecure themſelves, eſpecially, againſt the Deſigns and Attempts of thoſe men, who they knew well enough, held them for no other than Uſurpers; muſt be in Reaſon ſuppoſed to require no more Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them by the Engagement, than ſuch as may, and is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given to Uſurpers: Which, ſays he, is not an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Title, and a Promiſe of Allegiance, but meerly a Promiſe of living quietly <hi>ſo long as they are under their Power, and enjoy their Protection.</hi>
               </q>
Whereas,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Tho' he will not allow any Promiſe of Allegiance to be contained in the Engagement; there was not only a Promiſe to be <hi>true and faithful to the Commonwealth</hi>; but as <hi>then establiſhed, without King and Lords:</hi> Which was an expreſs owning it for an eſtabliſhed Government. And himſelf had before laid it down as a Rule, that <note n="(a)" place="margin">Page 90.</note> Allegiance is a Duty, which every Subject, under what Form of Government ſoever, by the Law of Nature, oweth to his Country; and conſequently, to the Soveraign Power thereof. So that here muſt have been an Eſtabliſhed Government without a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Power, which is abſurd; or elſe they who took the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with an honeſt Mind, could not but think that their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was transferred to Perſons inveſted with Sovereign Power.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) He very abſurdly ſuppoſes, that becauſe Governments, eſteemed Uſurpations by their Enemies, ſeek to ſecure themſelves; therefore they ſeek to be ſecured only as <hi>Uſurpers</hi>: that is, not believing that they are <hi>de jure,</hi> and that the Allegiance of the Subject is due to them, becauſe their Enemies deny they have any Right. Or elſe, that to oblige the Subjects to defend the Perſons of the Governours, is a neceſſary Security for <hi>Rightful Governours</hi>; but unneceſſary for Uſurpers: which is equally abſurd.</p>
            <p>But admit the <hi>Biſhops</hi> Evaſions would hold for the Engagement; it is evident, that there is no true ground for them in the preſent Oath of Allegiance: For he takes it for a clear Truth,<note place="margin">Caſe of Engagement, <hi>pag.</hi> 97.</note>
               <q>That all Promiſes and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, wherein Faith is required to be given to another, ought to be underſtood <hi>ad mentem imponentis,</hi> according to the mind and meaning of him to whom the Faith is to be given; ſo far forth, as the meaning may reaſonably appear by the nature of the matter about which it is converſant; and ſuch ſignification of the Words whereby it is expreſſed; as, according to the ordinary Uſe of Speech amongſt Men, agreeth beſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:54552:38"/>And tho' he allow the Promiſer of Faith in ſome caſes to take advantage of <hi>Ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity</hi> in the Words of the Promiſe,<note place="margin">Page 99.</note> and to make uſe of that <hi>Latitude of Sence</hi> which was left undetermined: Yet he does not permit Men to advantage themſelves of any <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, ſecret,</hi> and <hi>reſerved intent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our <hi>Law-makers</hi> have been ſo far from giving occaſion to ſuppoſe, that they had an hidden Intent to have this Government ſworn to, only as an Uſurpation; That,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They acknowledge <hi>their Majeſties</hi> to be <hi>rightfully invested</hi> with the Regal Dignity, and declare their Submiſſion to them upon the Account of Right: Which Submiſſion being not only for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but as the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of all <hi>England</hi> not perſonally preſent; the Subjects that ſwear to be true and faithful to <hi>their Majeſties,</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to anſwer the meaning of their Oath, if they pay not the Faith due to <hi>rightful Poſſeſſors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. They faithfully promiſe to <hi>defend</hi> the Perſons of their <hi>preſent Majeſties,</hi> and the Limitations ſetled by that Act, which requires the Oath, <hi>againſt</hi> all Men whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They uſe ſuch a Word to engage the Subjects to the Service of <hi>their Majeſties,</hi> as in common and legal Intendment, and by Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon</hi>'s own Confeſſion, implies Subjection to a Rightful Government. Every Man muſt take Allegiance to imply a Legal Tie; and the Law ſuppoſes this, to be only to a Legal and Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Government. Nay, the Biſhop himſelf holds, That it is due only to the Rightful Governour; and that the exerciſe of it is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended during an Uſurpation.</p>
            <p>Whoever therefore takes the preſent Oath with a Belief, That he ought to retain Allegiance to the late King; or that he is in any reſpect King of <hi>England,</hi> or ought ſo to be, muſt needs be guilty of <hi>material Perjury.</hi> And if he does it, after the Import of the Oath has been fairly repreſented, it will be very difficult to avoid <hi>Formal Perjury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will agree with Dean <hi>Sherlock,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vindic. <hi>p.</hi> 80.</note>
               <q>That a different Opinion may excuſe from <hi>formal Perjury</hi>: For no Man is formally perjured, who does not know it.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:54552:39"/>The evading therefore this Snare and hazard of Damnation, by an Oath which artful Men have made of doubtful Interpretation, were one benefit of an expreſs Oath of Abjuration, which the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderer</hi> ſeems never to have thought of.</p>
            <p>Nor, indeed, has he ſaid any thing materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al againſt thoſe Arguments for one,<note place="margin">Fift General Head.</note> which he has thought fit to mention; only has given occaſion for Men to take greater notice of the Advantages to the Government and Nation, which it would be likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
            <p>He aſſerts very Magiſterially, That an Oath of Abjuration <hi>will neither gain their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties any new Friends,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 26.</note> 
               <hi>nor fix the old ones faster: nor diſcover any old or new Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I think, whoever impartially conſiders, may ſoon be ſatisfied in the contrary to every one of theſe Aſſertions: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Since it is evident, that they who take the preſent Oath are really bound to the Import of an Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> and are guilty of <hi>material Perjury,</hi> if they take the Oath in a lower ſence; theſe Men, when they are under a neceſſity of bethinking themſelves of what they are already bound to, are likely to take the Oath in ſuch a Sence, as will make them Friends of Enemies: Or if they were not to be accounted other than Friends before, they will by an Oath of Abjuration be fixt faſter to their Duty.</p>
            <p>But if any, who have hitherto paſs'd for Friends to this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould refuſe an Oath of <hi>Abjuration</hi>; it appears by what has been above obſerved, that this Oath would make a Diſcovery of Enemies, not before truly known.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Many Men may be thought to have held off from this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe they thought it at leaſt doubtful, whether it aſſerted its own Right; but would readily ſubmit to that Authority, which ſhould put that out of queſtion: The chief Difficulty having been, to ſatisfie Men that they ought to ſwear Allegiance to any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, meerly upon the account of Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Several may have held off out of Worldly Policy, when they found ſo many ſeemingly come into the Government, tho' really a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, that they might think it in danger of over-ſetting by the number of Enemies within. But when theſe found, not only the Men in Offices, but the Generality of the Nation, engaged and united in the Defence of the Gouernment againſt all Enemies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; they would find no Temptation to be of a divided Party, or Intereſt.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:54552:39"/>4. Tho' thoſe Subjects who are Friends to this Government upon a Principle, cannot be fixt faſter to it by an Oath of <hi>Abjuration</hi>; ſince that can oblige them to no more than they already know to be their Duty, and Practiſe, as they have Opportunity; yet it may be thought an occaſion of fixing Friends abroad, and of gaining new ones; when the Honour of the Government is vindicated, and its Continuance and Strength ſecured, by an Oath, which will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve all men who ſhould break it, in formal, as well as material Perjury.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But as this Gentleman's Charity will not admit of a Diſtinction between <hi>Formal</hi> and <hi>Material</hi> Perjury; and therefore he could not think of any Benefit which might accrew by an Oath, which would free honeſt Men from the Danger of the Firſt; Neither do his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks reach to another Benefit of an Oath of <hi>Abjuration</hi>; which is the weakning Enemies, and ſtrengthning and ſupporting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the Friends to it: Which cannot properly fall within the only <note n="(a)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 26. An Oath of Abjuration will neither gain their Majeſties any new Friends, nor fix the old ones faſter to them; nor yet diſcover any old or new Enemies. And, what is an Oath good for, that will anſwer to none of theſe ends and purpoſes.</note> ends and purpoſes of an Oath, which he could think of.</p>
            <p>The Benefits likely to ariſe from ſuch an Oath might appear in many Inſtances; of which I ſhall name ſome:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whereas, according to the Doctrine too generally received, Men may ſwear to the Government, without giving any Security for the Support and Defence of it; all Men who ſhould take an Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> would proclaim their being engaged in its Defence; to the Horror of its Enemies, and Encouragement of Friends, both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether this ſtruck Terror into Enemies or no, the engaging Numbers to ſtick to the Government in all Events, when before they thought themſelves at liberty to chuſe their Side, could not but afford real Security and Strength.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such an Oath would vindicate the Honour of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which hath ſuffered moſt by the Reproaches of pretended Friends.</p>
            <p n="4">4. They who before thought themſelves as much engaged as they could be by this Oath, would be enabled to ſerve the Government with Courage, when they ſaw the Nation Sworn-Brethren for the Defence of it: Whereas, before, the Fears of Treachery might
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54552:40"/>
weaken and diſpirit too many in the Service, who might think that every Step they took, they trod upon a Mine ready to ſpring.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Effects of an Act of <hi>Abjuration</hi> would be very beneficial, if it were only upon the account of Offices.</p>
            <p>The Influence of the Offices of the Kingdom Eccleſiaſtical, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary, and Civil, is ſo very great, that the Conſtancy of the People of <hi>England</hi> to the National Intereſt, while all the Offices were in the Hands of that Party, who are now againſt the Right of <hi>their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties</hi>; as it is an Evidence, how deſpicable that Party muſt needs be without ſuch Supports; is an undeniable Argument for taking from them that wherein lies all their Strength and Power to do Miſchief.</p>
            <p>Here the Conſiderer Objects:</p>
            <p>Obj. 1. <hi>Will they not rather be enabled to do more miſchief, by being more truſted for ſuch an Oath?</hi> Which admits of ſeveral Anſwers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They cannot be more truſted than they have been, in confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, That they had taken the Oath without any mental Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If they ſhould take ſuch an Oath; the Preſumption, as I have before ſhewn, will be ſtrong for their keeping it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They could not, if they would, do as much miſchief as they have done; becauſe they could not have ſo many to joyn with them as they have hitherto miſled, with Pretences which would ſerve no longer.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Some at leaſt of the moſt dangerous, would be likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe it: Either, 1. To have the Reputation of Conſtancy: Or, 2. Of being true Sons of the Church; according to what has paſs'd for its Doctrine: Or, 3. Becauſe they are too far engaged in Plots againſt this Government, to dare to deſert their Party: Well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that of the Satyriſt,
<q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Carus erit Velli qui Vellem tempore quo vult</l>
                     <l>Accuſare poteſt—</l>
                  </lg>
                  <lg>
                     <l>He who has <hi>Vellie</hi>'s Secret has him faſt.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Admit they ſhould all take the Oath, and deſign to elude the plain meaning of it; this could not be without communicating and publiſhing their Evaſions: So that the Government would be ſufficiently alarm'd againſt truſting many of them; and however, it is likely would make a Diſtinction between them who have ſerved it out of Principle; and them who muſt renounce their Principles to come in to it.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:54552:40"/>6. As it is not to be ſuppos'd, that the Majority of thoſe who had declared the Right to be in the <hi>late King,</hi> would wilfully perjure themſelves to keep their Places; the Treachery of a few who had loſt that Credit with which they ſhould ſerve their Party, could not ballance againſt the advantage of having all of a piece, and united againſt the common Enemy; and the ſtrengthening the hands of Friends by the places of them who ſhould abſolutely refuſe to abjure the late King's Pretenſion; or however, ſhould be thought not to have deſerved ſo much for coming in at the Eleventh Hour, as they that came in at the Firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. But whereas to ſerve his purpoſe he had held, that all who take the preſent Oath, and yet retain an Allegiance to the late King, wilfully perjure themſelves; that therefore all theſe would take an Oath of Abjuration;<note place="margin">Page 27.</note> and that it is not <hi>in man to find out or aſſign one tolerable Reaſon why they ſhould not do it</hi>; he ſounds his main Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection upon the Suppoſition,<note place="margin">Page 31.</note> that <hi>all that take the Oath of Allegiance will not take the Oath of Abjuration; but a great number of good People, that ſerve their preſent Majeſties with Faithfulneſs, Honeſty and Diligence, and with Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection too,</hi> will by reaſon of that, be <hi>diſpoſſeſſed of their Employments, and incapacitated to ſerve them any longer: For to be ſure, no other but the honeſt, faithful, and the conſcientious, will be diſpoſſeſſed thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As has appeared above, how good foever ſuch Men may be; they cannot be good Subjects, but are to be accounted Enemies; becauſe the only poſſible ground for thhir Refuſal, muſt be the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that the <hi>late King</hi> ſtill retains a Right to diſpoſſeſs their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties; and, at the leaſt, is not to be oppoſed: And therefore, the more conſcientious they are with that Opinion, the more dangerous they are to the preſent Government.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Since he holds, That a great number of theſe Men will be diſpoſſeſſed, ſo much the greater will be the Benefit to the Publick by ſuch an Oath, as it diſarms the more Enemies, and ſupplies their Places with the more Friends; making Men to be uſeful, who had been loſs'd to the Publick.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we could ſuppoſe that theſe Conſcientious Men are truly Faithful to the Government; and yet their Faithfulneſs could not over-ballance the Prejudice of their Education, againſt the Right of them whom they ſerve, as having Right; the men muſt needs be ſo ſhallow in their Underſtandings, that no Government would have any loſs of them.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:54552:41"/>4. If theſe Men were as affectionate to their preſent <hi>Majeſties</hi> as our <hi>Conſiderer</hi> ſuppoſes, they ſhould be contented to have their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fill'd by Men, who would vindicate their Majeſties from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful Imputation of being Uſurpers; which the Principles of theſe Men ſix upon them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If great Numbers ſhould be diſpoſſeſſed, we muſt ſuppoſe, that at leaſt the Heads of the Party would go among the reſt: And then no man could be tempted to deny the Right of their Majeſties as a Recommendation to Places under them; but it would be as much a man's Intereſt to be for the Right, as it has been to be againſt it.</p>
            <p>When therefore Intereſt ſhould fall in with the univerſal Bent of the Nation; what would become of that Party which has been no way conſiderable, but by the Artifices and Encouragement of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Friends?</p>
            <p n="6">6. If all the <hi>de facto</hi>-men ſhould be diſpoſſeſſed, they who decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Regal Dignity to be <hi>rightfully invested</hi> in their Majeſties, and they who have from the beginning approved of that Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, will be enough to fill all the Offices of the Kingdom; and to ſupport the Government, which they ſo readily and thankfully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to, as a <hi>Deliverance</hi> not only from the <hi>late King,</hi> but from that Party which had much longer Tyraniz'd over them.</p>
            <p>But, ſurely, the <hi>Conſiderer</hi> cannot but be thought ſomething out of ſeaſon in his Argument, againſt diſpoſſeſſing them who will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>abjure</hi> the late King, nor Recognize the Right of their Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties; at a time when the Nation is ſo ſenſible, that there has been Treachery ſomewhere: And cannot but think it moſt probable, if not certain, that they who have a Sett of Principles for the purpoſe, ſhould be the men that ſhould act uniformly to them.</p>
            <p>Indeed, it is very difficult not to think, that how much ſoever a <hi>Prince</hi>'s innate Goodneſs and Clemency may put him upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Enemies by Kindneſs; that method is always dangerous, while there is any Competitor for the Crown. For if the Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition be weak, that is the moſt likely means of giving Strength to it: But when, by the Treachery of them who have been truſted, or any other means, the Competitor out of Poſſeſſion has an inviting Proſpect of Returning; every Act of Indulgence towards his Party (which they that believe him to have the Right muſt be) ſerves as a Step towards his re-mounting the Throne.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:54552:41"/>Some of theſe Enemies, perhaps, hardly know themſelves to be ſo: But if they will not come up to that Teſt, which the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Publick require, for the diſtinguiſhing them from Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſhould they be let in, the Crowd would follow.</p>
            <p>By what I have already repreſented, it may appear, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of procuring an Oath of Abjuration, is not to be accounted <hi>vile and ſelfiſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 31. &amp; 32.</note> as this Gentleman inſinuates: And that it is ſo far from tending to the Hazard of the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Welfare</hi> of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that it ſeems the only probable means of ſecuring it: I had almoſt ſaid muſt be judg'd ſo, by all who do not think the Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their King of Right, the only means to an end, which all would be thought to aim at; even they who would receive the <hi>late King</hi> with French Forces.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, that many who would think it an happy day for <hi>England,</hi> when an Oath of Abjuration ſhould be enacted, would be as well pleaſed with the Converſions, as with the Falls of the moſt of them, who, notwithſtanding the preſent Oath to their Majeſties, think or declare themſelves at Liberty to ſerve the <hi>late King</hi> upon all occaſions: Not but that they who wiſh well for <hi>England,</hi> muſt needs deſire to ſee ſome men made as exemplary in Puniſhments, as they have been in Treachery, and the Profeſſion of Principles fitted to juſtifie them.</p>
            <p>I think it has fully appeared, that an Oath of Abjuration is no new Project, or a <hi>freſh Spaniſh Wreck</hi>; to which he moſt wittily compares it. If it were a <hi>French</hi> Wreck, perhaps he might lay a Claim of merit to it.</p>
            <p>However, they are moſt likely to deſerve the Name of <hi>Projectors,</hi> who pretend to ſecure the Government by an Oath leſs explicit than was ever before uſed, and that at a time when new Arts had made it neceſſary to have one, more explicite than ever; who would find out <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n Invention to ſupport a Government without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending it; to make <hi>Paſſive Obedience</hi> ſupply the place of <hi>Active</hi>; to make two oppoſite Allegiances in force at the ſame time; and to carry on a War between two <hi>Rival Kings,</hi> without engaging the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in the Quarrel, till they ſhould ſee which ſide had the better; and, if they muſt fight againſt either, to ſecure the Poſſeſſor, by fighting for the other whenever he ſhould land, or ſend his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:54552:42"/>Tho' I muſt allow the <hi>Conſiderer</hi> to know the Sentiments and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Enemies to the preſent Government;
<q>I am ſure we are not to take it upon his Word, That the Managers of the <hi>Jacobite Party,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 30.</note> and more underſtanding People among them, do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand abett and favour an Oath of <hi>Abju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>;<note place="margin">Page 31.</note> well knowing they ſhall find their Account in it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If they did promote this, ſtill, according to himſelf, who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways free with his Friends; this would be no Objection againſt it; ſince, as he ſays, <hi>they have hitherto ſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> but <hi>Puny Politicians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 30.</note> 
               <hi>and have laid and managed their Deſigns with ſo much weakneſs and ſimplicity, that they ſeem to be infatuated very much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſure, if they ſhould deſire an Act of Parliament for an Oath Abjuring their King's Pretence of Right, it would be an undoubted Evidence of their Infatuation.</p>
            <p>Nor can it enter into my Imagination, that any <hi>Jacobite</hi> ſhould deſire this: For it muſt be either a <hi>Jacobite</hi> in Office, or a <hi>Jacobite</hi> out of Office: But who can think that a <hi>Jacobite</hi> in Office ſhould deſire an Oath, to turn himſelf out; when he may at his Pleaſure give King <hi>James</hi> the ſame, or a greater Proof of his Loyalty, by laying down before that Diſcovery of himſelf becomes a Forc'd-put?</p>
            <p>If it be one out of Office, nothing but Envy and Repining at the Advantages which others enjoy who deſerve no better than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, could make them wiſh their Friends removed: And all Men muſt judge, that in ſuch caſe Envy would be more prevalent than Zeal for their <hi>King's Service</hi>; which one Man in a conſiderable Poſt may promote more than Thouſands elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Oh! but they are likely to reap Advantage from the <hi>Diſtractions</hi> an Oath of Abjuration will undoubtedly produce among us:</p>
            <p>So far from that, that it will prevent Diſtractions and Diviſions of Duty: For Men who take an Oath of Abjuration, will no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be able to trim between <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Fact,</hi> till they are almoſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted to know which they ſhould adhere to; nor will there be drawing of different ways among Benches of <hi>Justices of the Peace,</hi> or other Officers; of which ſome notable Examples might be given.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Diſtractions</hi> are, by the turning men out of Offices, who can ſerve <hi>their Majeſties</hi> no otherwiſe than as Poſſeſſors of the Throne without Right; a very fair riddance of them! But, ſurely, theſe
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54552:42"/>
               <hi>Paſſive Men,</hi> who pretend that they will live quietly under a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which their Conſciences will not give them leave to <hi>defend,</hi> will not raiſe a Rebellion to recover their Places. And if they ſhould, perhaps it were no indeſirable effect of ſuch an Oath: For when the Body of this Nation, which is entirely for <hi>their Majeſties,</hi> had all the Men in Offices of their ſide, how eaſily, how happily, would ſuch a Rebellion be quell'd! If this were the effect of ſuch an Oath, I am ſure it would diſcover, or occaſion, the <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> of the <hi>Jacobite,</hi> or rather French Party here; and would in all likelyhood for ever free this Government from the Danger of Enemies, Foreign, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick.</p>
            <p>But ſhould there be hazard in this, it were certainly better to have the Enemies declared, than lurking under the Mask of Friend<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Yet in farther Diſproof of his Suggeſtions, I ſhall ſhew, not only that no one ought to refuſe an Oath of Abjuration, if required by Act of Parliament: But that the Refuſers cannot be conſiderable in Number or Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Here I may uſe, 1. Some Arguments <hi>ad hominem.</hi> 2. Others, ſuch as I take to be in their own nature convincing to Men capable of Conviction.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Conſiderer</hi> has no reaſon to ſuppoſe, that any man ought to refuſe an Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> if required by Act of Parliament: For not to repeat his Conceſſions before obſerved,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) He profeſſes, that he ſhall think he has <hi>repreſented matter but confuſedly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 25.</note> if his Friend do not ſee from his <hi>Collections,</hi>
               <q>That the Oaths of Fidelity and Allegiance have been conſtantly impoſed on, and taken by the Subjects of the Land, (concern'd to take them) to ſuch Perſons as were by the Conſent and Approbation of the <hi>Three Eſtates of the Kingdom</hi> inveſted with the Regal Power; although they could not lay Claim thereto by Lineal and Legal <hi>Succeſſion.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I think it is no great Queſtion, but he here admits Allegiance to be due in ſuch caſe. And if Allegiance be due, there is no doubt but it is due in that Sence in which it was <hi>conſtantly</hi> impoſed and <hi>taken</hi>; which as I have ſhewn, was always as to a King of Right, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with it an implied Recognition, and Abjuration.</p>
            <p>He, therefore, in owning Allegiance to be due to their Majeſties, does as much as confeſs, that they have the Right to the Crown, and that the late King has none: Nor is it to be thought that any but a Quaker that believes this, will refuſe to ſwear.</p>
            <p n="2">

               <note place="margin">Page 32.</note>(2.) He ſays,
<q>No one that in good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience took the Oath to <hi>their preſent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties,</hi> can find himſelf at liberty to ſerve by any ways or means one that would <hi>certainly dethrone them.</hi> This is undoubtedly the leaſt that an Oath of Allegiance can do, that it ties the Hands of all that take it from lending any manner of Aid or Aſſiſtance to the <hi>late King James.</hi> But if his Poſt be Active, he he is farther obliged thereby to be Active in their Defence. If a Privy Councellor, a Biſhop and a General, take the Oath of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> they are undoubtedly obliged thereby to adviſe faithfully; and keep their Secrets; to pray for their Proſperity, and fight the Battles of them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Where,</p>
            <p n="1">1. His <hi>Rightful King</hi> is ſuch an one, as has no Allegiance due to him. And if that which ties the Subjects to him is broken, he muſt confeſs that he is no longer their King, nor can have Right to be their King, while another has Right to their Allegiance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He having expreſly aſſerted, That no man who has ſworn to <hi>their Majeſties</hi> may aid or aſſiſt King <hi>James,</hi> what follows of Fighting the Battles of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> muſt be meant as well againſt King <hi>James</hi> as any other. But certainly, if the late King ſtill remains <hi>Rightful King,</hi> his Perſon is irreſiſtible by Officers as well as others, who, according to thoſe who are ſuppoſed likely to ſcruple an Oath of <hi>Abjuration,</hi> are, or ought to be his Subjects. If then his Irreſiſtibility is gone, his Royal Character is loſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the generality of the <hi>de facto-men</hi>; and particularly <note n="(a)" place="margin">

I ſhall not diſpute the lawfulneſs of reſiſting the Kings Authority; whether it were lawful for the Parliament to take Arms againſt the King to defend the Laws and Liberties of their Country.</note> Sermon before the Houſe of Commons he ſeems to mince the matter.</p>
            <p>Yet it muſt needs be ſaid, That a King, till he <hi>ceaſes to be a King,</hi> is not by the Law of <hi>England</hi> reſiſtible, nor ever was; but by a temporary Clauſe in King <hi>John</hi>'s Charter, left out in all ſubſequent Confirmations of the Engliſh Liberties.</p>
            <p>He, therefore, that admits the <hi>late King</hi> to be reſiſtible, therein, virtually pronounces him to have fallen from the Royal Dignity; and may very well ſwear the Right to be in their Majeſties, and abjure thoſe Pretences, againſt which the Biſhop invokes God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive Judgment, when he prays for the <hi>Proſperity</hi> of their Majeſties, while engaged in a War againſt him;</p>
            <p>

            <p n="3">3. No man who has taken the preſent Oath, is to be preſumed likely to refuſe an Oath of Abjuration; becauſe, tho' many are not ſenſible how far they are engaged by the Oath they are under; they, as has appeared above, have already virtually acknowledged the Right of their <hi>preſent Majeſties,</hi> and abjured the late Kings Pretenſion. But not to ſwear expreſly to what is ſworn by manifeſt Implication, is ſuch a Nicety, as one would think reaſonable men ſhould not be guilty of.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As 'tis under the Notion of keeping to the Doctrin of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that men think to juſtifie their evading the plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the preſent Oath, and their refuſing to take any Oath more expreſs; when the Church Authorities making for an Oath of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration</hi> come to be weighed with thoſe which are againſt it; the firſt muſt needs apparently turn the Scale, and induce men to take an Oath, clearly expreſſing what the preſent Oath implies.</p>

            <p>
               <q>I do not deny, that the chief Intention of thoſe who require Oaths of Allegiance to themſelves, is to bind men as faſt as may be to them: There is a Perſonal Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſequent upon it: But then I ſay, that the <hi>Rule and Meaſure</hi> of it is not to be taken from ſuch Intention of the Perſons, but from the <hi>General Good,</hi> which was chiefly intended in ſuch things. For there is a common Good of Humane Society, which Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have an Obligation to, antecedent to that Obligation they are under to particular Perſons. For as Magiſtrates were deſigned for a general Good, ſo the Obligation to them muſt be underſtood ſo, as to be <hi>ſtill in ſubordination to the main end.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And it is agreed on all hands, that an antecedent and ſuperiour Obligation doth void that which is ſubſequent and inferior, when they contradict each other. Elſe an Oath might bind a man to ſin: Which no man will aſſert.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Therefore whatever the Intention of the Perſon was, <hi>how ſtrict ſoever the Expreſſions may be,</hi> if the keeping the Oath be really and truly <hi>inconſiſtent with the welfare of a People,</hi> in <hi>ſubverting the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws</hi> which ſupport it, I do not ſee how ſuch an Oath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continues to oblige.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:54552:45"/>From all which theſe Inferences are natural:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Anoynted King</hi> upon the place, or for the time being, he who is the <hi>Liege Lord</hi> and <hi>King</hi>; is God's <hi>Vicegerent, placed</hi> over the Subjects by <hi>God</hi>'s Act, Appointment, or Providence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That tho' <hi>God</hi> may place two upon the Throne in a joint par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Sovereignty; he cannot otherwiſe be ſaid to have two <hi>Vicegerents</hi> in the ſame Dominion. And therefore the Prince, who is diſpoſſeſſed, cannot be God's <hi>Vicegerent,</hi> nor have Right ſo to be, while the <hi>Vicegerent</hi> of God's Placing keeps Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Allegiance of the Subject is due to the <hi>Leige Lord</hi> and <hi>Lady,</hi> or <hi>Vicegerents</hi> of God's placing; and to none elſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That as the Obedience to Princes is reſembled to the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to <hi>God the Father</hi>; and of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to the <hi>Son</hi>; the Allegiance due to our <hi>Princes,</hi> according to the Doctrine of our Church, is <hi>Active</hi> as well as <hi>Paſſive</hi> Obedience. And therefore we ought to obey their Commands, in fighting for them againſt the <hi>Diſpoſſeſſed Prince,</hi> as well as againſt any other Perſon.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That, therefore, agreeably to the Doctrine of <hi>our Church,</hi> the Right of the preſent <hi>Leige Lord</hi> and <hi>Lady</hi> ought, if required, to be ſworn to; and the Pretence of the <hi>late King</hi> to be <hi>Abjured.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. That there can be no Objection againſt this, from the Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that <hi>his Majeſty</hi> is not our <hi>Natural Lord,</hi> as not ſtanding firſt upon the Royal Line: For then, neither could King <hi>John</hi> have been a <hi>Natural Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) I might ſhew ſeveral Arguments, in their own nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing; of which I ſhall name ſome: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. No Temporal Peer can be ſuppos'd to ſcruple an Oath of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration,</hi> becauſe he either has, or is preſumed to have ſworn Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to their Majeſties; which is a devoting of Life and Fortune to their Service, againſt King <hi>James,</hi> as well as any other Enemy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. No <hi>Commoner</hi> is to be thought to decline this; becauſe it is to be preſumed, that he will be obedient to the Common Law; which, as I have ſhewn, obliges him to take the Common Law Oath of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,</hi> either in the Turne or Leet. And that Oath, according to the Simplicity of ancient Times, and the natural Import of the Words, carries with it both a <hi>Recognition,</hi> and <hi>Abjuration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. No Man can reaſonably ſcruple this, as contrary to the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing Obligation of a Former Oath of Allegiance: For,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:54552:46"/>1. How careful ſoever the Conſtitution has been to ſecure the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance of the Subject, by an Oath <hi>to the King for the time being</hi>; it has made equal Proviſion for the ſafety of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vide ſupra.</note> Tho' men have not lately been expreſly ſworn to the Defence of the Kingdom; the Conſtitution interprets the meaning and extent of the Word <hi>Allegiance.</hi> When, therefore, that which was ſworn to the <hi>late King</hi> came to interfere with the Publick Safety; either the equal Obligation to both left Men to their Choice, or, rather, the ſupream Law of the Publick Safety took place; and that the rather, becauſe Prince and People were jointly bound to the Defence of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the preſervation of the Rights of the Crown of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. As appears by the Explanation of the Coronation Oath,<note place="margin">Vide Infra.</note> received with the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor</hi>'s Laws.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the Engliſh Subjects are ſworn to their Princes, the Princes are reciprocally ſworn to their Subjects. Theſe Oaths make a <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Contract</hi>; the wilful Breach of which on either ſide, diſcharges the other.</p>

But the King ought of Right all Lands, and all Honours, Dignities, and Rights and Liberties of the <hi>Crown of this Kingdom,</hi> entirely, and without Diminution, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and defend; the diſperſed, ruinous, and loſt Rights of the Kingdom to the due ſtate, with all his Might, to reſtore.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:54552:48"/>
ought to do all things in his Kingdom according to Law, and by the Judgment of <hi>his Peers.</hi> For Right and Juſtice ought rather to Reign in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than a corrupt Will. Law is always that which makes Right; but Will, Violence and Force is not right.

So that God be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured above all things, and be always had before his Eyes. He ought alſo to raiſe up the good and approved Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms; but to aboliſh the bad, and drive them all from his Kingdom. He ought to give right Judgment in his Kingdom, and maintain Juſtice by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the <hi>Peers</hi> of his Kingdom. But all thoſe things the King ought in his proper Perſon, the Sacred Goſpel being look'd into, and touch'd, and upon the Sacred and Holy Reliques, to ſwear, before the People, the Prelates, and inferiour Clergy, before he be Crown'd by the <hi>Archbiſhops,</hi> and Biſhops of the Kingdom. For the King ought to have three Servants; to wit, Luxury, Avarice, and Concupiſcence; which if he keep Servants, he ſhall Reign well and illuſtriouſly. He ought to premeditate all things for the good of his Kingdom. And this is the part of a King.

That the <hi>French</hi> had till then ſhewn great Patience in ſupporting the Imbecility and unfitneſs of Kings: That they had had one after another, altho' they were not ſubjected nor bound to obey them, but <hi>on the Condition of which we have ſpoken above:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> the Oath cited <hi>ſupra.</hi>
                  </note> That Conditional Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ought not to be kept, if they are not <hi>reciprocally</hi> obſerv'd. But that <hi>Childerick</hi> had not done any thing of that which he was bound to by the <hi>Condition</hi>: Wherefore the <hi>French</hi> ought to be freed from their Oath. Beſides that, the Biſhop was to remonſtrate to the Pope, that doing <hi>Pepin</hi> this Favour, he ſhould have Succours againſt the <hi>Lombards,</hi> who made War againſt him. The Pope, therefore, being ſollicited, and moved by the Reaſons laid before him by the Biſhop; and building upon the hopes of receiving Succours from <hi>Pepin</hi> againſt the <hi>Lombards,</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> diſcharged the <hi>French</hi> from the Oath made to King <hi>Childerick.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This having a manifeſt Relation to the nature of the Oath, which appears to have been expreſly Conditional, yields a full Proof, That when the Law of <hi>England</hi> received the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Judgment upon <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric</hi>'s ſuppoſed Breach of his Coronation Oath, it, in effect, declar'd the Oath of the Subjects to a King of <hi>England</hi> to be of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with the Oath of the Subjects of <hi>France.</hi> And certain it is, that the Conſequence of the King's Breach of the Oath, is declared to be the ſame here as in <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>But if what I have ſhewed of the Confeſſor's Law, and the <hi>Ritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi> of the Coronations of our Princes, left it yet doubtful, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be ſuch a <hi>Contract</hi> between <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> that the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Breach of his Coronation Oath diſcharges the Subjects from the Oath of Allegiance; the Abſtract which I here offer, of what Records, Hiſtories and Law-Books will abundantly evince, may, as I conceive, ſilence this Controverſie; both as to the <hi>late King's ceaſing to be King,</hi> and the Legality of the Poſſeſſion of <hi>their preſent Majeſties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the time of the <hi>Heptarchy</hi> there was a Law in a <hi>General Council</hi> of all <hi>England,</hi> expreſly affirming,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Anno</hi> 789.</note> or providing for, the Liberty of the <hi>States</hi> to <hi>chuſe</hi> their King; which muſt relate to their reſpective Kingdoms: But this Law makes no Limitation, ſo much as to any Family: Yet from before that time, all the <hi>Anglo-Saxon</hi> Kings ſeem to have been of the Blood of <hi>Woden</hi>: And particularly <hi>Cerdic,</hi> the firſt of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi>: and <hi>Ina,</hi> who ſeems the firſt of that Kingdom, who was Monarch over all; was <hi>choſen,</hi> as being of the Blood of <hi>Cerdic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Ina</hi> we may lay the Foundation of the <hi>Monarchy</hi>; as he was the firſt Monarch of all <hi>England,</hi> after being King of that Kingdom, to which, as to the Head, all the reſt were ſince united. From <hi>Ina</hi> to <hi>Brictrick</hi> no Lineal Succeſſion was in the leaſt regarded. His Succeſſor <hi>Egbert,</hi> whom ſome make the firſt Monarch, becauſe they ſuppoſe that then the Lineal Succeſſion began, was <hi>choſen</hi> upon the account of his Merit, and being of the Blood of <hi>Ina.</hi> To <hi>Egbert</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Son <hi>Athelſtan,</hi> as is gathered from Charters, tho' not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as I remember, by any Hiſtorian which has occur'd to me.
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54552:55"/>
And this <hi>Athelſtan</hi> was a King of ſome Parts of <hi>England</hi> in the Life-time of his Father. To <hi>Athelſtan</hi> ſucceeded his Brother <hi>Ethelwolf,</hi> who had been bred a Clergy-man. His Son <hi>Ethelbald,</hi> was in the Father's Life-time King of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons.</hi> Tho, as it ſeems, he left Male Iſſue, his Brother <hi>Ethelbert</hi> ſucceeded him: Then another Brother <hi>Ethered,</hi> who, for certain, left Iſſue. Him the youngeſt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Alfred</hi> ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>All theſe Succeſſions of Brothers, as <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Will proves beyond Contradiction, were by vertue of Settlements, or <hi>Elections,</hi> in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Councils.</hi> His Will alſo ſhews, that one <hi>Ethelbald,</hi> then alive, was the Son of one of his Brothers; and that there was a Couſen <hi>Osferth,</hi> who might have been the Son of <hi>Athelſtan,</hi> Brother to <hi>Ethelwolf.</hi> To <hi>Alfred</hi> ſucceeded his Son <hi>Edward.</hi> But the <hi>Ethelbald</hi> laſt before mentioned, was <hi>choſen</hi> by part of the Kingdom, and made War againſt him: Wherein, tho' he loſt his Life, his Party had the better. To <hi>Edward</hi> ſucceeded his <hi>Bastard</hi> Son <hi>Ethelſtan</hi>; then the mulier <hi>Edmund</hi>: his Sons <hi>Edwi,</hi> and <hi>Edgar,</hi> were ſet aſide for their Uncle <hi>Edred. Edwi</hi> ſucceeding, was rejected by the <hi>Mercians</hi> and <hi>Northumbrians,</hi> who <hi>choſe</hi> his Brother <hi>Edgar,</hi> who afterwards was <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen</hi> to the whole. Upon his Death there was a Competition between <hi>Edward,</hi> who ſeems to have been <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Baſtard Son; and <hi>Ethelred,</hi> undoubtedly legitimate. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Party prevail'd for his being King: But his Murder ſoon made way for <hi>Ethelred.</hi> The <hi>Ritual,</hi> or <hi>Pontifical,</hi> us'd at his Coronation, which appears to have been a Standing Form, is preſerv'd to us in the <hi>Cotton Library</hi>; wherein, among other things, there is a Prayer to <hi>God</hi> to bleſs this Prince pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Elected.</hi> He being guilty of Miſgovernment, was rejected; and <hi>Swein</hi> the <hi>Dane</hi> received. Upon the Death of <hi>Swein, Ethelred</hi> was ſoon reſtored, upon promiſe to govern better than he had done. Soon after, <hi>Cnute</hi> the Son of <hi>Swein</hi> Lands, with a Claim, as it ſhould ſeem, of the <hi>Divine</hi> Right of Succeſſion, as the Son of <hi>Goldesburgh,</hi> Daughter of King <hi>Ethelbald,</hi> who either was the Son of an Elder Brother of King <hi>Alfred</hi>; or elſe, if it were another <hi>Ethelbald,</hi> the Claim from him as a King in <hi>England,</hi> ſhews, That a Qualification from the <hi>Saxon Blood</hi> Royal was accounted ſufficient for any one, of Merit, and Power, to make good his Claim.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding which Claim, part of the Kingdom kept to <hi>Ethelred</hi>; and upon his Death they choſe <hi>Edmund,</hi> who, as appears from undoubted Authorities, was a <hi>Baſtard.</hi>

               <hi>Hardicnute,</hi> the Legitimate Son, ſucceeded. Upon his Death Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> was <hi>choſen Adminiſtrator</hi> of the Affairs of the Kingdom, during a <hi>Vacancy</hi>: And, thro' his Influence, <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> Son of <hi>Ethelred</hi> by his Queen, was choſen; whoſe Parliament ſays, The <hi>Hereditary Succeſſion</hi> was endanger'd by the Interpoſition of the <hi>Danes.</hi> In that Body of our Laws, which moſt of our Kings to this very Day have expreſly ſworn to maintain, they are declared to be <hi>Constituted</hi> to do Juſtice, and to <hi>ceaſe to be Kings,</hi> if they Anſwer not the ends for which they are conſtituted. The <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> being jealous of the Power of Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> and his 7 Sons, all of them Earls; to ſecure himſelf againſt them, by the Power of the Earls <hi>Leofrick,</hi> and <hi>Siward,</hi> obtains a Settlement in <hi>Parliament</hi> upon his Coſen <hi>William,</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> Grand Nephew to the <hi>Confeſſor</hi>'s Mother <hi>Emma</hi>: Beſides that, <hi>William</hi>'s Wife <hi>Matilda,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Baldwin</hi> Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> came from a Daughter of King <hi>Alfred. W.</hi> 1. dying in <hi>Normandy,</hi> was upon his Death-bed preſs'd by ſome about him to appoint his Succeſſor; which he declared, That he had no Authority to do, but left it to God's Providence: plainly intimating, <hi>That</hi> as he could not appoint his Succeſſor, <hi>neither had any body a Right to ſucceed, till choſen or ſubmitted to, by the States, or People.</hi> He wiſh'd indeed, that his Second Son <hi>William</hi> might ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; which prevail'd as a Recommendation: And tho' the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> would have had <hi>England</hi> to go as an Acceſſion to <hi>Normandy,</hi> where <hi>Robert</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>William</hi> 1. was received, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made the Younger Son <hi>King</hi>: And after his Death, <hi>choſe</hi> a third Son <hi>Henry,</hi> tho' <hi>Robert</hi> was ſtill alive.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ritual</hi> of the Coronation of <hi>H.</hi> 1. to be ſeen in the <hi>Cotton Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,</hi> bound up together with that of <hi>Ethelred</hi>'s, agreeing with it in ſubſtance, inſtead of <hi>purely Elected,</hi> has <hi>pre-elected</hi>; plainly relating to the Choice before the <hi>Inveſtiture</hi>: Which, indeed, is ſuppos'd in both the <hi>Rituals,</hi> in that part which is intituled, <hi>The Deſignation of the Royal State</hi>; where the Kings are exhorted to <hi>retain</hi> the State, which they had to that time: He procured a Settlement of the Crown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Son <hi>William</hi>; and after the Death of him, and of another Son, upon his Daughter <hi>Maud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One <hi>Author</hi> indeed ſays, It was only, in caſe he died without Heir: Others ſay, without <hi>Heir Male.</hi> Certain it is, that <hi>Stephen,</hi> Siſters Son to <hi>H.</hi> 1. being with him in <hi>Normandy</hi> at his Death, made uſe of his Recommendation; which, together with his own Merit, and the Conſideration of his being of the <hi>Blood Royal,</hi> induced the <hi>States</hi> to chooſe him. Nor had he any diſturbance from <hi>Maud</hi>'s Pretence of Title, till he began to play the Tyrant. And tho' ſhe

was near being Crown'd, ſhe refuſing the main Preliminary, the Promiſe of maintaining the <hi>Confeſſor</hi>'s <hi>Laws,</hi> was rejected before ſhe had been fully received, and ran away in a Fright. Which made way for <hi>Stephen</hi>'s remounting the Throne.</p>
            <p>Then her Son <hi>Henry</hi> became an Adventurer for the Crown. But the Chief Forces on both ſides being <hi>Engliſh</hi>; and <hi>Stephen</hi>'s brave Son <hi>Euſtace</hi> his deſign'd Succeſſor, dying, both ſubmitted to the Umpirage of a <hi>Parliament,</hi> which decreed, That <hi>Stephen</hi> ſhould Reign as long as he liv'd, and <hi>Henry</hi> after him, as <hi>Lawful Heir</hi>; That is, as the Charter then paſs'd explains it, as Adopted Heir to <hi>Stephen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Death of <hi>Stephen, H.</hi> 2. was made K. who, to ſecure the Succeſſion to his Eldeſt Son, got him to be Crown'd King in his own life-time; which brought great Troubles upon the indulgent Father: Tho' in the Oath of Allegiance ſworn to the Son, there was an expreſs <hi>Salvo,</hi> not to prejudice what was due to the Father, as long as he liv'd, and would exerciſe his Right. This Son died in the Life-time of his Father; who was ſucceeded by another Son <hi>Richard,</hi> who was called no more than Duke of <hi>Normandy</hi> till Crown'd. After him, the <hi>States choſe</hi> King <hi>John,</hi> as the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> then expreſly declared.

               <hi>John</hi> having broken the Original Contract with a witneſs, the <hi>Barons</hi> invited over <hi>Lewis,</hi> the Dauphin of <hi>France,</hi> to be their King; whoſe Right to be <hi>choſen,</hi> the French King's Advocate aſſerted, in that the Throne was become <hi>Vacant</hi>; that upon that the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration fell upon the <hi>Barons</hi>; who <hi>choſe Lewis,</hi> upon the account of his Wife, whoſe Mother was the only Survivor of all the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Brothers, and Siſters. Upon <hi>Lewis</hi> his Landing, great part of the Nation joyn'd his Arms againſt <hi>John</hi>: And in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility <hi>Lewis</hi> had obtained quiet Poſſeſſion of the Throne, had he not diſcover'd an Intention to treat the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as Traytors againſt their Prince, in receiving him. This his Folly, and Ingratitude, made the <hi>Barons</hi> deſert him. And <hi>John</hi> dying in the Quarrel, they <hi>choſe Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Son of <hi>John</hi>; tho the Father's Violations of his Oath, and their Rights, were freſh in their Memories.

               <hi>Henry</hi> dying while his Son <hi>Edward</hi> was abſent in the Holy War, the <hi>States</hi> convened and choſe <hi>Edward</hi>; upon whom, as they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Government was devolved by <hi>Hereditary Succeſſion,</hi> and the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> or Submiſſion, of the Peers of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>E.</hi> 1. in the 25th of his Reign publickly begg'd Pardon of his People for his Miſgovernment; and being upon croſſing the Seas, entreated them to receive him again, if he ſhould return; if not, that they would make his Son King after him.</p>
            <p>He was ſucceeded by <hi>E.</hi> 2. who for his Miſgovernment was ſet aſide, and his Son <hi>E.</hi> 3. choſen in his ſtead. Upon whoſe Death <hi>R.</hi> 2. came in, by vertue of a Settlement upon him in Parliament, tho' the Right of <hi>Proximity</hi> was in <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> the eldeſt ſurviving Son of <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>R.</hi> 2. governing very arbitrarily, was, about the middle of his Reign, fairly admoniſhed by his Parliament, who told him, That they had an <hi>ancient Statute,</hi> according to which they might <hi>abrogate</hi> him, and ſet up <hi>ſome body near of kin,</hi> of the <hi>Royal Stock</hi>: But he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king no warning by that, and the Example of <hi>E.</hi> 2. was depoſed, and <hi>H.</hi> 4. Son of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> received: In whoſe time the Crown was entailed by Authority of Parliament. <hi>H.</hi> 5. came in under the Entail; yet it was thought a mighty Sign of the Confidence the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had in him, that the Lords ſwore Fidelity to him before he had taken his Coronation Oath.</p>
            <p>His Son <hi>H.</hi> 6. being a weak Prince, was prevailed upon to advance <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York,</hi> till he was raiſed to a Competition for the Crown, which he pretended to as Son to <hi>Ann,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> Son to <hi>Philippa,</hi> Daughter of <hi>Lionel</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> third Son of <hi>E.</hi> 3. and yet weighty Objections lay againſt that Claim: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Right of <hi>Proximity</hi> was in <hi>H.</hi> 6. as deſcended from the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſurviving Son of <hi>E.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are ancient Authorities which tell us, That the Crown had been entailed in the time of <hi>E.</hi> 3. upon Heirs Male.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The like Authorities ſay, That <hi>Philippa,</hi> under whom <hi>Richard Duke of York</hi> claimed, was a <hi>Baſtard.</hi>

            <p>However, notwithſtanding <hi>Richard</hi>'s Claim of Right, <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. was, by the <hi>States,</hi> adjudg'd to hold the Kingdom during Life. And <hi>Richard</hi> dying, his Son put in for the Crown, upon Suggeſtion, that <hi>Henry</hi> 6. had <hi>broken the Contract establiſhed in Parliament,</hi> and was unfit to Reign. But tho' <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. ran away from <hi>London,</hi> the chief Seat of Power, <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. was by his own Parliament accounted not to be King, till ſome time after, when the <hi>States</hi> had received and crown'd him: He leaving his eldeſt Son an Infant, <hi>Richard</hi> the Uncle aſſum'd

            </p>
            <p>The Power and Cunning of <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> who had many Blots in his Eſcutcheon, cauſed him to be received ſo generally, that <hi>Richard</hi> made Head againſt him with a very unequal Number: and dying in the Field of Battle, his Body and Memory were left to be trampled on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> 7. having firſt obtained a Settlement of the Crown, by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Parliament, upon himſelf and the Heirs of his Body, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Daughter and ſuppoſed only ſurviving Child of <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. from which Marriage came <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. who made ſeveral Settlements in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: In two of which he declared, That if the Limitations then made, ſhould fail, the Kingdom would be deſtitute of a Legal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour.

During whoſe Life, it was made Treaſon to deny the Parliaments Power to diſpoſe of the Crown, and Forfeiture of Goods and Chattels after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
            <p>Not to mention the frequent Sollicitations of Lords and Commons for her to name a Succeſſor for their Confirmation; becauſe the Law had not determined who ought to ſucceed.</p>
            <p>Tho' the Parliament 1 <hi>Jac.</hi> 1. ſeem firſt to have ſet up the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Right of Birth; by good Fortune they accounted it ſo Sacred, or would have the King believe ſo; that they made no Settlement, only offer'd their Recognition to him, as the firſt Fruit of their Loyalty and Faith to him, and his <hi>Royal Progeny,</hi> and <hi>Poſterity, for ever</hi>: which if it were a Settlement, would leave the <hi>States</hi> at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to chuſe any one of his Progeny and Poſterity. This is the laſt Colour of any Settlement of the Crown, before that which was made upon their Preſent Majeſties, directly agreeing with the Recognition, 1 <hi>J.</hi> 1.</p>

            <p n="1">1. If all the Biſhops, Abbots, and Priors, and all the Lay No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, who took the Oaths above, eſpecially the laſt; at the ſame time believed the Right of Succeſſion, or other Right to the Crown, to be in any other Perſon than <hi>H.</hi> 6. they were manifeſtly guilty of down-right Perjury.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:54552:60"/>2. As it is to be preſumed that they would not all forſwear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; it is to be concluded, that they believed <hi>H.</hi> 6. to have been <hi>rightfully by Succeſſion born to Reign</hi>; or, as is ſaid of his Son, <hi>natural born Soveraign</hi>; and by conſequence, that his Right was founded upon the Act of Settlement 7 &amp; 8 <hi>H.</hi> 4; or, at leaſt, ſome way dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from what our <hi>de facto</hi>-men go upon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is to be believed, either that the ſame Oaths were taken in the Houſe of Commons, tho' no Journals thereof are now to be found: Or elſe, that the Power and Influence of the Lords <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal,</hi> was then held ſo great, that no Attempt of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> to the contrary of what the <hi>Lords</hi> had ſworn to maintain, was in the leaſt to be feared.</p>
            <p>It muſt be confeſs'd, that theſe Oaths did not long ſecure that unfortunate Prince <hi>H.</hi> 6. But then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He was one of neither Spirit, nor Ability, to uſe the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which he had.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It cannot reaſonably be imagined, that if the laſt Oath had been taken throughout the Kingdom, <hi>E.</hi> 4. could have raiſed any Party to make Head againſt <hi>H.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. However, <hi>E.</hi> 4. claimed a Right to be received for King, upon pretence that <hi>H.</hi> 6. had broken the <hi>Contract eſtabliſhed in Parliament,</hi> and was <hi>unfit to Reign.</hi> Nor is it for me to hold, that any Oath can or ought to be a Security when ſuch a caſe happens.</p>
