         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Tract of warre cannot (I hope) be unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to your Hands, whose Bodies are daily imployed in Martiall affaires. Nor let it seeme strange that one of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession should produce a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this Nature; seeing there are seldome any Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers without men of our Quality: The Ministring Levites were not onely in the Campes of Israell, but
<pb facs="tcp:56719:6"/>
also had their speciall Offices and Charges allotted to them. Such grace the Helmet, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the Soldier, and fit him at all goings Out for his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier dissolution.</p>
            <p>When I was abroad with our Armies (I speake it to their honor) I found large maintenance, and faire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, though with a great deale of hazard both of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and life, in regard of the Enemies too great forces, and our long and hasty Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, together with tedious Beleaguerings: yet (by the
<pb facs="tcp:56719:7"/>
all-ruling Providence of God) I came off enriched with some knowledge, and Military experience; which I account a rich prize, though purchas'd at an high price.</p>
            <p>I will not relate unto you the fearefull and horrid issues and effects of warre; such as are <hi>poverty and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Trading, famine, violence, depredation, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of Justice and Civility, slighting of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy, firing and plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Countries, death of famous Commanders,

been of excellency and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse) yet in these latter of small or no consequence.

            <head>SECTION 1. Of the dignity, necessity, and law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of a Soldiers Calling.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no Calling under Heaven which hath not beene by slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Spirits traduced and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified: and amongst all, none hath been more disgrac'd with opprobrious language than this of a Soldier. For some have held it unlawfull; others have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56719:12"/>
imputed the Personall Crimes to the very Calling it self: some have held that all Soldiers are irreligious and perfidious, as that old verse hath it:
<q>
                  <l>Nulla sides, pietasque viris qui</l>
                  <l>Castra sequuntur.</l>
               </q>
So that there have been those who have condemn'd the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for the Persons, and the Persons in the Calling: Now, briefly in this first Section, the Calling shall be cleered from these foule and unjust Aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which Malice or Cowardise hath cast upon it.</p>
            <p>First, therefore if any will hold the Calling unlawfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of many grosse and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Abuses dayly committed by Soldiers; as suppose, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56719:12"/>
Swearing, Murthers, Rapes, Stealing, Pillaging, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of houses, Drunkennes, or the like; (though it is to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed that none of these were to be found in the Tents of Israel) yet, nor any, nor all these can prove the Calling to be unjust: for so it will follow, that the best and strictest Calling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men (even the very Calling of the upright Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, nay, even the sacred Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Ministry) shall be in this respect made void: for who knowes not, but that in some Age or other, some, or most of these Enormities have been found in some of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors. Now, how untrue and ridiculous such fond conceits
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56719:13"/>
are, any one may easily judge: it may as well be proved, that Wine is not to be used, because many men are drunke with it; gold &amp; siilver are to be rejected, because many are covetous for them; Good meats are disalow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, because many follow glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony and riot; and good cloaths are to be cast aside, because so many abuse them to pride and luxury: how soon should the best and most warrantable Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling be left off, if such absurd positions were once approved for Authenticall.</p>
            <p>Therefore men should not rashly accuse or condemn the Calling, because some or many of the followers doe abuse themselves in it. And let me
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56719:13"/>
speak truth, there neither is, nor hath been any Calling, which hath had stricter or severer Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline proclaimed and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it, than this of the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for most of the Transgressors of warlike Orders are punished with death, and torture of the Delinquents; the Sword-law rather inclines to justice than mercy; Peccants in Armies (without the speciall favour of the Prince interveening) are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually made exemplary by some fearefull execution or other, <hi>in terrorem,</hi> to daunt and terrifie others from running such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopefull hazards: A Court of warre sets forth the strictest or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and heaviest punishments, hence have they such variety of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56719:14"/>
tortures; seldome is there any connivence, if once they be put over into the hands of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner, for he rather addes some kinde of misery (being commonly such who hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to shew pitty or mercy) than lessens that which is enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to inflict; nor is it any safe course for him to use or shew favour, for that will be but a meanes to procure to himselfe the like punishment which he should have inflicted upon the condemned Malefactor.</p>
            <p>To come therefore to shew the dignity and excellency of this Calling: Appeares it not sufficiently, whereas the sacred Oracles give God himselfe these Attributes; <hi>The Lord of Hosts;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56719:14"/>
The Lord is a man of warre; The Lord walkes in the midst of thine Army; The Lord overthrew Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh; Oh thou sword of the Lord rest and be still:</hi> And is not the Eternall Sonne of God called <hi>the Captain of our Salvation,</hi> and <hi>He led Captivity captive</hi>; He it was that triumphed over the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall <hi>Goliah,</hi> and by his uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered power hath got himselfe the victory, and ransom'd us when we were Prisoners. To descend; Are not the glorious Angels termed by the warlike phrase of <hi>legions of Angells?</hi> two destroyed 5 Cities, one cut off 185000 of <hi>Senacheribs</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in one night. To come yet lower; Did not those radiant lampes of Heaven, the Stars in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56719:15"/>
their courses fight against <hi>Sise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra?</hi> What are all the creatures but <hi>Militia Caeli?</hi> Haile, Snow, Wind, Vapors, Stormes, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, are so called by holy <hi>Iob: Who</hi> (saith he) <hi>can number up his Armies?</hi> Now to speak of men (if I intended length of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) what might I say of great <hi>Abraham,</hi> valiant <hi>Moses,</hi> unconquered <hi>Ioshuah,</hi> mighty <hi>Sampson,</hi> stout <hi>Gideon,</hi> resolute <hi>Iephte,</hi> renowned <hi>Deborah</hi> &amp; <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach,</hi> experienc'd <hi>David,</hi> with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse others? Could I not speak of those <hi>Centurions,</hi> the one was commended by our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour for his faith; the other was said to be a worthy man, for he had built the people a Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue; and the third devout
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56719:15"/>
and charitable <hi>Cornelius,</hi> whose prayers were so forcible, and almes-deeds so manifold, that they came up before God for him; and who can but confesse these to be Commanders in warre? To shut up all, the Church by King <hi>Salomon</hi> is said to be <hi>terrible as an Army with Banners</hi>; and St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath sung it, <hi>The noble Army of Martyrs praise thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if any shall urge, that all these were excellent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for piety as well as valour; but what can be said for the common (but more properly) the private Soldier? they are known to be full of all impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; witnesse warlike Histories of all times, which largely shew
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56719:16"/>
the fearefull and horrible villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and abuses of them. It may be said first, 'tis not for want of good Examples, nor good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, nor is the Objection ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally true: For Examples, 'tis manifest their Generals have been good; and if that common Rule faile not, <hi>Magis ducimur Exemplis quÃ m Praeceptis,</hi> what hinders the Soldier from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing? <hi>Gideon</hi> said it to his Army, and it was performed; <hi>As ye have seen me doe, so doe ye:</hi> and before him <hi>Iosuah,</hi> when he put the people to declare in point of Religion; his pious and resolved example, <hi>That he and his House would serve the Lord,</hi> brought in all the Army to doe the same: and when that great
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56719:16"/>
Army which did surmount the number of 380000. men, were put to answer whose side they would take; when they heard that worthy speech of their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall King <hi>David,</hi> answered all with one heart, <hi>Thine we are Ã´ David, and for thee will we fight</hi>: So that 'tis plain if good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples have any force in them, the Soldier may be consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, just, and pious, as well as his Commander.</p>
            <p>Nor secondly, are they naught for want of good orders or Discipline; for an Army is but a well-govern'd Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth in Armes: Now 'tis held by all men, that where good Orders are, there usually are the fewest abuses, men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56719:17"/>
afraid to transgresse, <hi>formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine paenae,</hi> for feare of the lash; That <hi>Centurion</hi> which spake to our blessed Lord, mark his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: <hi>I am also a man under Authority, and have Soldiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me, and I say to one goe, and he goeth; to another come, and he commeth; and to a third, doe this, and he doth it.</hi> Of <hi>Cornelius</hi> 'tis said, <hi>That he feared God with all his House</hi>; and without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, those his servants which he sent to bring St. <hi>Peter</hi> to his house were Soldiers, and yet who can justly taxe their hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, fidelity, or piety? And who can accuse those Soldiers who came to St. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what they should doe? I should, and doe verily suppose
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56719:17"/>
them to have been good and vertuous men, for it seemes so by their comming, first to be instructed, then secondly for asking such a question which might informe them how they might be honest and religious; and thirdly, because St. <hi>Iohn</hi> did not any wayes increpate or chide them, as elsewhere he did the Scribes and Pharisees, (and I am sure he would not have spared to have told them their owne, had he known them to have been peccant.) Therfore 'tis plaine that good Discipline hath not onely been enjoyned unto, but also observed by the inferior Soldier.</p>
            <p>Then thirdly, what hinders Soldiers to be well governed,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56719:18"/>
and conscionable men? when they are alwayes next dore to death; now 'tis known, that the remembrance of the shortnesse of life, and the certainty of death, and Judgement to come, is and hath been a main incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to goodnesse, and hath wrought mainely upon mens hearts; witnesse that disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Temperance, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and of the Judgement to come, which that Divine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Gentiles had before the Governour <hi>Felix,</hi> who, though an Heathen, yet was so struck and convinced at the matter, that he trembled at the hearing of it, and dismissed the Orator till another time: So that I see not, but that the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56719:18"/>
as well as the Commander may be vertuous and religious.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as the Calling is worthy and excellent, so 'tis as necessary: For how should a Prince be able to defend his own Right, but by such instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? How should he offend him that hath wronged him, his Allies, or his Territories, but by the Soldiers valour? These are necessary in times of warre, for the punishment of Rebells, or other Enemies; necessary in times of Peace to be in readines upon all extremities: they are necessary by Sea, necessary by Land; for warre is not tyed or confined to one place alone, but sometimes on one, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the other, somtimes by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56719:19"/>
both: Necessary in Frontiers against Invaders; necessary in Field, to get victory to their Prince: 'Tis hard for a State to be long in safety, where the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met and musquet are cashierd: old <hi>Rome</hi> could never so long have triumphed over the world, had she not maintained her le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of old Soldiers? but when she slighted these, marke what one hath spoken of her:
<q>
                  <l>The Roman State did then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to shrinke,</l>
                  <l>When they began to Court, to Coach, and Drinke.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>How quickly will Effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Cowardize surprize a Nation, without exercises or imployments for warre? To preserve the power of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56719:19"/>
Empire, they alwaies make choyce of their Emperor who is naturally addicted to warres. <hi>Grave Maurice</hi> the Prince of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range had wont to say, that he was naked when he was not enquartered amongst the old English Regiments. As 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice without great cause to begin warre, so 'tis as little Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy to let the sword rust. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not see how long the plough could subsist in quietnesse, nor yet the Master reape his corne with joy, if he was not defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the sword: 'tis held wisedome to have the plough going within, and the Soldier marching without: a right Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier is the joy of the Farmer, the defence of the City, the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56719:20"/>
shield for Learning, the credit of his Nation, and the glory of his Prince. And what though the times be not alwaies for their present service and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment? A wise man (I hold) may lay up his sword, but I shall not count him so who breakes it: it is good alwayes to have (as in all other occasions) good store before-hand; so also in this: for Soldiers are not like Poets, who are so borne; but they are made by long and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous hazards and experience; it is not one Summers march, or twice or thrice drilling by his Corporall, nor yet his great oaths will qualifie him for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent service: they were the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terani milites</hi> that stood it out:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56719:20"/>
a winter leaguer, with hard du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will freeze the courage of such as are not experienced: Though their charge runs high for the Prince, yet when He pleaseth to use them, they will quickly bring in all costs and charges, or else dye for the cause. Who now would hold them unfitting or unnecessary to be imployed and maintained, who will willingly meet death i'th' face for the honour and profit of their Master.</p>
            <p>It was wittily jested by the Marquesse <hi>Spinola,</hi> concerning the old <hi>English</hi> in the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> when he heard one of his Lords term them old Dogs; <hi>'tis true (said he) they are so, and if it was not for such old bitten
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56719:21"/>
Curres, I would quickly worry the Vnited Provinces.</hi> 'Tis well when the Generall can say, he hath as many Soldiers as men: 'twas a sharpe one of him who told a Lord Generall who brought a great multitude of raw and unexpert Soldiers into the field; Sir, I see abundance of Serving-men, but no Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. I could (if I pleased) be large in this Theame, but I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend brevity: for Soldiers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light more in Actions than words.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that this Calling is warrantable, who can doubt it, seeing the God of Heaven ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves it? hath not He appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it for a punishment unto the Nations? He gave <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:56719:21"/>
hire and wages for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which he performed for him. St. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> did not disallow of the Soldlers Calling who came to him, but onely gave them cautious directions, as not to doe violence, and to be content with their wages Was it not lawfull; why then have Kings and Princes in all ages (who were wise and holy men) used it, and have prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
            <p>And if it shall be objected, that therefore K. <hi>David</hi> should not build the Temple, because he had shed blood, and had been a warriour: That's not principally meant of the blood of Gods enemies, or his owne; but spoken of the blood of <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riiah</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:56719:22"/>
which was kill'd with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more of his Seconds by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> councel and direction. If any shall say, that sucking chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Innocents of young yeares are murthered in warres, as well as others: What's that to the purpose? Is not the case of pestilence and warre in this point alike? Where God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the Rule to be generall, 'tis no safety to put in excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Saul</hi> smarted for his foolish and indirect mercy shewed to the <hi>Amalekites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, warre is lawfull in respect of the Cause, Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or Religions defence: 'tis warrantable in respect of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, working what Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed; and who dare question
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56719:22"/>
the Actions supreme? 'tis que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse good, because Heaven commands it; being good, why may it not be undertaken? It is justly allowable in respect of the end, being Gods glory, the Churches prosperity, the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes peace, the subjugating of Enemies, the establishment and confirmation of Right and Justice, with divers other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences needfull, just, and pious.</p>
            <p>Though there be an old law, <hi>Bellum quasi minime bellum</hi>: that's either the taunt of some Satyricall fancy, or beggerly Poet, or else spoken of that warre which is <hi>injustum (.i.)</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and unrighteous: So that, nor that, nor all the phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stique
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56719:23"/>
conceits of <hi>Anabaptists</hi> against warre under the Gospell can any wayes disparage that high, heroick, generous, noble and honorable Calling, allowed by God, and followed by the best of men in all Ages.</p>

            <head>SECT. II. What men are fittest to choose for Soldiers.</head>
            <p>THere hath been no small controversie and dispute about this Subject: And for certaine, the advantage or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of foiling the Enemy consists much in making choice of Soldiers; <hi>ex quolibet pigno
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56719:23"/>
non fit Mercurius.</hi> All Spirits are not borne under the Planet of <hi>Mars,</hi> nor all Conditions fit to follow Drums and Trumpets: Let not the Soldier be <hi>nomine infamis</hi>; for 'tis certain, <hi>frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea erit Executio, cum debilis fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erit Electio.</hi> Some (with <hi>Zerxes</hi>) care not what valour be in the men, so that they abound in numbers and multitudes: But is not this to set chaffe to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the winde; or as to appoint Hares against Lions? It is not the number but the vertue and valor that gaine Conquest; and who march to the field of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry through slaughtered carka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses? who knowes not how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten few numbers of the <hi>English</hi> Regiments have not onely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56719:24"/>
but also overthrowne great Armies of the <hi>French,</hi> and that even in the heart and bowells of all <hi>France,</hi> whenas the <hi>French</hi> have been as good as five for one (a mighty odds to all probability) had there not been great difference in the courage of the Combitants: and did not that noble and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be forgotten Christian Soldier, the renowned <hi>Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> with an handfull of his <hi>Epirots</hi> not onely defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Province from the insulting threats and mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the great <hi>Turke</hi>; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all affronts offered did also bravely revenge themselves by overthrowing those huge and vast Armies which were sent
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56719:24"/>
against them by the <hi>Turkish Sultan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it hath not onely been so by Land, but also by Sea: Have not great Navies been dispersed and scattered by small numbers? Witnesse that unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raleld Sea-fight betwixt the Christians and Turkes in the <hi>Levant</hi>; for though the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an General Don <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> with the <hi>Venetians</hi> and others were great in numbers, yet the Turke farre surmounted them; but in conclusion, what a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full slaughter did the Christians make of them? and what a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous victory was obtained o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them? And how often have great Navies of <hi>Spaniards</hi> been queld and conquered by a few
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56719:25"/>
               <hi>English</hi> little ships, by the valor of our Commanders, such as were <hi>Clifford, Frobisher, Caven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish, Haukins, Drake,</hi> who when they met, made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> know, that though they had gotten, yet they should not dare to keepe their <hi>Indian</hi> Gold, but yield themselves and it to their conquering swords: And is it not true, that 4 or 5 Merchant ships of <hi>London</hi> well appointed for Sea, dare not onely look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but also grapple with three times so many of the Turkes: and whence is this? (next to the providence of Almighty God, who can overthrow with few as well as with many, and who is the sole giver of all victory) it may be accounted that it is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56719:25"/>
the valour and expertnesse of the Soldiers: an ounce of Steele being worth a pound of Lead, and a few Lions better than a great company of Stagges. So, that certaine it is, that it much concernes a State to make choice (in times of need) of such Spirits as are naturally the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test for that great imployment of warre.</p>
            <p>The colder Climates have usually produced the terriblest Soldiers; and the Country hath commonly yielded hardier men for all hazards, than populous Cities, they being (for the most part) too tenderly and effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately bred.

rough and laborious Trades, especially such who use their limbes most forceably at worke. In Cities choice may be made of Car-men, Porters, Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Wine-Coopers, Roape-makers, Dyars, with Brewers servants and Attendants; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which many able, lusty, strong, and hardy men may be found fit for service. As for Shoo-makers, Tailors, Ostlers, Chamberlains, Tapsters, Coach men, Foot-men, Weavers, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shierd Serving-men; Fidlers, Vintners-Journy-men, &amp;c. though these may be better spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both for their great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and uselesnesse at home, than the former; yet they are held not so good to fight, or to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56719:27"/>
endure the hardnesse of the warres, as the former; yet from the mixture of both there may be a compleat Army gathered up.</p>
            <p>Amongst the Nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> 'tis held, that the <hi>French</hi> be too hasty to offer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, but too light to hold on against stout resistancies: most count the Cavallery of <hi>France</hi> better than the Infantry, they being for the most part well bred for the saddle. The <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> is much degenerate; and <hi>Rome</hi> in stead of sending forth Consuls, and Legions of stout Soldiers, sends out Friars, Monkes, and Jesuites. The High-Dutch (unlesse mixt with other Nations) are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56719:28"/>
too dull and slow. The Dane (much like the Low-Dutch) drowzy, and is so farre from being excellent by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that neither of them are good with others: hence is it that both of them in any occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are forced to be beholden to other Nations; as to the <hi>English, Scots, French, Wallons,</hi> and <hi>Switzers</hi>: nay, the Low-<hi>Dutch</hi> trust not any of their frontier Garrisons with compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their own Nation alone, as well knowing how easily they would yield upon furious as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults; they are so wary at Sea, that usually they man their ships with <hi>English, Scots</hi> and <hi>French</hi>; have they not maintained them selves at home by others valor
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56719:28"/>
for many yeares, and gain'd from their Enemy? In their We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Plantations, where they have effected any thing against the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or hold any thing safely now, is it not by other mens hearts more than their owne? The <hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>Pole</hi> are much alike, yet 'tis thought that the <hi>Pole</hi> is the better horse-man and the <hi>Swede</hi> the stouter foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; however the long warres in Germany have flesh'd them both. The Spaniard usually is held to schoole or Trades till 14 or 16 yeeres old, and ever after for the musquet: and to speake truth, he hath valour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make attempts, and to get ground, and he wants it not to hold it: he is fit for heat,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56719:29"/>
cold, hunger, or thirst; yet he is better for land then sea, and better to hold a Fort then to fight in field.</p>
            <p>Now for certaine (without any disparagement to other Nations) 'tis known that there is not a truer bred spirit for war by land or by sea, then the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi>: for who ever affronted them without sufficient proofe of their ability; especially if they pleased to call in their Seconds to accompany them? What Country of Christendome hath not felt the force of their steele? and the <hi>Turkes</hi> at sea confesse it, that they had rather deale with any Nation then the <hi>English.</hi> So that if they be well ordered, and kept in by the rules of good
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56719:29"/>
Discipline, they feare not the faces or forces of their stoutest foes: and have one singular vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue beyond any other Nation, for they are alwaies willing to goe on; and though at first stoutly resisted, yet will as reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely undertake the action the second time, though it be to meet death it selfe in the face.</p>
            <p>To be briefe; most men would have Soldiers to partake more of the Country then the City, to be sturdy and stiffe, rather then courteous and affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: I would have them stout, hardy, temperate, watchfull, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, faithfull, obedient, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; for an an Army of such persons is most likely to prove to the honour of their Prince,

            <head>SECT. III. What weapons are the fittest for Soldiers; and that the Pike is not of consequence in these times.</head>
            <p>WIse Commanders have alwaies had great care to have their forces, both Horse and Foot, to be well and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly furnished with the most serviceable Armes and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: for 'tis good Policy to take all advantages in field, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially against such Enemies who neither take nor give faire Quarter; such as are <hi>Dragoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56719:30"/>
Gravats,</hi> with some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees of <hi>Freebooers</hi> and <hi>Hanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>; against whom any sort of murthering weapons may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: However, for the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of weapons, most men will approve of them best, which have these five properties:</p>
            <p>First, they should be Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive against Assaults, fit and able to safeguard the persons of those Soldiers who beare them into the field: these make the Enemy loath to come on, and encourage our Soldiers to make attempt: by this course many great Armies have been discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited. In this regard the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> is much to be commended, for he still keeps himselfe in his Armes: but above all others, the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56719:31"/>
               <hi>Turkes</hi> are vigilant this way; for they in their march against Enemies, move like a compleat Armory for variety and choice of weapons: Our Nation of late hath been much to blame, who against all Orders have many times for the enjoying a little ease, cast away their Armes for the present, though after strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and severely punished by their Officers for their fault; and though they have been by this course unfit to have made Resistance (if any occasion should have been offered.)</p>
            <p>Secondly, 'tis not enough to have weapons for a Defence, unlesse also they can Offend: the former respecting the good of our owne persons, these ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56719:31"/>
at the annoying and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying our Enemies; 'tis the end of warre to weaken his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to subjugate his Armies by cutting off and lessening his numbers; and therefore those weapons must needs be counted excellent which are fit to bring to passe our intended desires: herein the <hi>Polish</hi> and <hi>Hungarian</hi> horsemen are commendable, &amp; it is to be supposed they have learn'd that Custome from their neighbouring Enemy the <hi>Turk.</hi> And indeed defensive weapons may be used in times of Peace, but offensive are the best for warre: why need men goe forth to kill their Enemies, except they be allowed such instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as can perform the deed?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:56719:32"/>Then thirdly, 'tis good, as to have weapons so qualified, so also is it as convenient to have them light and portable: 'tis not to be expected, that a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier can fight stoutly upon the suddaine, whenas by long mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and hot weather he is tired under his Armes: Soldiers should take a pleasure in beare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, but they should not be burthened under them: Hereupon 'tis thought that Buffe-coats came so much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, because they are so easie and comely, and (if good) as fit for defence as common Cors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets: The <hi>High-Dutch</hi> and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall forces are excellently well accommodated with nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Armes, being most of them
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56719:32"/>
proper able persons, and also furnished with very light Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, though these three things be fit to be in Soldiers weapons, yet they are then far better, when they come from the hands of the Artificer dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trously and sufficiently tempred and made; to effect which, there is no better inducement then to see that the Labourers be paid their wages, (good and certaine Pay being the spurre to Work-men to make their work compleat and serviceable:) and for certain, when they are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly payed, if they faile in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering in good Armes, they are then liable to severe punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the Magistrate, and are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56719:33"/>
fit to be made Examples, and discarded their places with Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominy and disgrace: Our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was ill provided for swords, those which were delivered to the Soldiers being so brittle, that with any blow almost they would breake to peeces: there is no Nation that may have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then our owne, if care be had; we having first, excellent matter; and secondly, as expert Artificers to give them forme as any Nation, nay, in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects farre better.</p>
            <p>Then lastly, weapons should be so made, that they may be with conveniency, and (as much as can be with advantage too) used in all places, and at all times: for their chiefest virtue
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56719:33"/>
is in their generality of use. Hereupon the short strong Sword is held better then the long Rapier, or (as the <hi>Switzer</hi> useth) two-handed swords: the Musquet and Fire-lock are held excellent, because seldome can an Army be so instraightned, but that Soldiers may use these with terror and advantage: these are good for all convoyes, marchings, intrenchings, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagings, onslaughts, neere or farre off; they are easie of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, terrible in their executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doing their message quickly and throughly, as after shall be proved.</p>
            <p>And though the Musquet be but of late Invention, yet none that ever went before it was
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56719:34"/>
more approved and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; nor was any weapon (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the sword onely) so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received of all Nations as the Musquet hath been. Now for certaine, the Pike hath been of great repute in former times also; yet in these latter losing much of it's antient authority, as being experimentally known for true, that it is not of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive virtue against professed Enemies: for it's antiquity is not a sufficient argument to tye our times to conformity to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the former; after-Ages having altered and changed, nay, quite left off many kindes of weapons that were antiently in use: Now it shall briefly appear to all, how un-usefull the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56719:34"/>
Pike is in Military occasions at this present, and that in many respects.</p>

         <div n="4" type="section">
            <head>SECT. IV. That the Pike cannot offend, or doe Execution.</head>
            <p>AS there is nothing doth more encourage the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to assault, so, nor is there any thing that doth more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten Soldiers to fight vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly, then the knowledge and certainty of a disproportionable disability of Armes: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath alwaies been coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the best Policy in warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst open Enemies, as to take
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56719:35"/>
the advantage of Time, Place, Numbers and Valour, so also of warlike Instruments: And they have been accounted ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Commanders, who have invented new Stratagems to foyle the Enemy; and hence those Armes have been accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted most admirable, which can most offend and annoy the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Party.</p>
            <p>Now it shall plainly appeare, that the Pike cannot effect, or doe execution; For whereas 'tis pretended that they alone keep off the Enemies Horse, nothing lesse, as shall after be proved: and admit they did, yet that service was to be accounted de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive onely. Now suppose the Enemy invading be either
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56719:35"/>
Horse or Foot, the former can kill at least 120 yards off, the latter at least 400 yards: now is the Pike able to kill at either of these distances, being 16 foot at most in length, and then push'd (perhaps) with armes of an impotent, sickly, weake-bodyed Soldier, or, which is as bad, by one that wants skill or courage, or both.</p>
            <p>And what more, there is not one private Soldier of twenty shall by his utmost strength and skill together runne through a common Corslet, nay, not through a Buffe-coat which is good, to wound mortally; and what wisedome or policy is it to have so many standing men in Armes, which are not able to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56719:36"/>
kill the Invaders: Further, hath it not been seene that three or foure good resolute Soldiers with their swords and Buffe-coats only have cut off ten or twelve Pike-heads, and come off safe without wounds, and purchased to themselves honor and reward?</p>
            <p>For an instance of this: The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his Leaguer lying before <hi>Scenke-Sconse,</hi> it so fell out, that there was a great uproare betwixt the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Switzers,</hi> they being enquar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd one next to the other; the occasion was small, being about a stiver or two lost at Cards; but the issue had likely to have produced wonder and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (if by faire perswasions
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56719:36"/>
and entreaties both parties had not been pacified) for the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult began to grow to an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine Mutiny (many men being wounded on both sides) so that the <hi>English</hi> first, and <hi>Switzers</hi> at last call'd to Armes: whenas there stood one of the Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Switzers</hi> pikes ready charg'd, did not then two Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of Collonell <hi>Burlacyes</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment with their swords only enter by force into that Body, and cut off divers Pike-heads, and came off againe with three or foure of them in their hands, which in fury and great derisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they flung againe amongst them, with this jeere to boote, <hi>Oh doe us no harme good men!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And because other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56719:37"/>
shall be used; Can there be any hopes of much slaughter of the Enemies by our Pike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, when not above three rankes at once can doe any hurt without prejudice and danger to their fellowes more then to their foes? which shall be thus proved:</p>
            <p>Admit the Pike be 16 foote long, the first Rank indeed have use and liberty of the whole length; but then the second Ranke loseth the benefit of three feet, and the third Ranke of sixe feet, if they stand charg'd at three foot distance: Or if upon close-charge at one foot and an halfe distance, (which though the stronger, yet disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, because the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56719:37"/>
bullets seldom misse) then the second Ranke loseth one foot and a halfe, and the third three foot at least; so that at the best, (the men being able and skilfull in Armes) yet what with the terror of the Alarme, the confusion of Rankes by the death of some, the time of night when the Enemy may fall on, the hazard of wounding in their thrust their own Commanders or Comrades (by their close standing) sufficiently shew that it is not the Pike that doth the feat.</p>
            <p>For, the liberty of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being horse-men, with speed and fury of charging, will, and doth so puzzell and non-plus the Pikemen, that in a Body of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56719:38"/>
Horse varying their motions, the Pike must play the Ape of force, and in case they faile in variety of Postures for defence, all is lost; which, in a Body so beset with furious Assailants, (conscious to themselves of their owne insufficiency of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance) easily yield to their Betters. And if the Enemy be Musquetiers, who knowes not but that a thousand expert, able Fire-men (using their utmost skill and advantage) are able to reduce two thousand Pikes to their own desired conformity? And all this is onely in regard that the Pike cannot answer like for like, but is forc'd to suffer the volleys of shot, and is no waies able for Replies. To proceed.</p>

            <p>ARmies are like great Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, must have all sorts of Provision; there's little, or no hopes of the long subsistence of that Body which wants In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse, Egresse, and Regresse: 'tis a dishonour to a Prince not to be able to come to his owne home; therefore 'tis, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies hath been the wisedome of Chiefes to sit downe and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarter in such places, to which there may be a confluence of Trading; so that the Campe and

            <p>Yet it often so falls out by the casualty of warres, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Enemies, that men cannot alwaies enjoy this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; For sometimes the Enemy or Neutrall friends blocke up passages, and then few men doe desire to goe to that Market where there is nothing to be bought but blowes. It hath been knowne that many good Spirits have paid deer for fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in others Provision; it shall appeare in one instance:</p>
            <p>Whenas foure <hi>English</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments lay in <hi>Bremeland,</hi> under the Command of that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd

and truly valiant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the <hi>English,</hi> the Lord <hi>Morgan,</hi> at the <hi>Long-Line</hi>; part of the Provision came up the River of <hi>Wesar,</hi> but that which came by Land was conducted by our Soldiers through our owne Horse-quarters; who, as they were many and neutrall, so they were as treacherous, for they would usually plunder and pillage our waggons, and kill our men if they resisted; and all under a pretext of want of pay, and that they hoped to requite us in another course: So that in plaine termes, the first warre in my apprehension was with our seeming friends, for our owne victualls too deerely bought.</p>

doe not hinder, yet distance of place, difficulty of way, time of yeare, Covenants of paying, want of ready monies, Remove of Armies, sudden alterations of Princes mindes may cause Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyes to be full of hazard: Else why is it called a Convoy, but because 'tis <hi>cum Via &amp; Vita,</hi> for way and life; and who are indeed more exposed to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers then Convoyers: being men whose lives hang upon Waggon wheeles, or, as I may say truly, Persons who alwaies carry their lives in their hands.</p>
            <p>Now, whosoever rightly conceives the necessity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyes in Armies, and what a great charge is laid upon the undertakers; For sometimes
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56719:41"/>
they bring along great treasure, as the pay for the whole Army; sometimes they undertake the protection of some great Prince or Commander: sometimes they bring Commissions, and letters of Intelligence, for the safety of the whole Body; may easily conclude, that seeing their way doth often lye through the Enemies Countries, they had need to pick men of singular valour, admirable courage, and choice dexterity for feates of Armes, and such as goe with Armes fitting to offend upon all assaults and occasions, such as shall any wayes, at any time dare to make approaches.</p>
            <p>Now it is plaine, that the Pike-men are altogether unfit
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56719:42"/>
for such high service as this is; not that any can question or disparage their valour or skill, but their unfitnesse for that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyment; which is thus proved to all:</p>
            <p>First, from the place where they may be set upon; if it should be in a Wood amongst trees, as such places are fittest for, and fullest of Pillagers and Freebooters for Ambush; I would faine know how the Pike could be in such places charg'd without a great deale of incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance in regard of the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of trees, which would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them to use their Postures? If, secondly, it should be upon the passage of some Bridge, were not 100 good fire-locks
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56719:42"/>
able to keepe that passage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst 500. Pikes, and pillage at their pleasure? If the place be a Narrow lane set with hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Bullets will force their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage through, whereas Pikes cannot. And if the ground be spacious and champaigne, gives it not the more compasse and liberty to the Enemy to come off or on, and to keep distance untill the Pikes be either most shot or kil'd; for in such places what are the Pike-men upon their charge, but even standing markes to be hit the sooner?</p>
            <p>Then secondly, from the time that the Enemy may fall on: If first, in the night, what a confusion will there be, for every man, first, to finde his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56719:43"/>
owne Armes? and then, what a deale of toyle to put them on? And if in the day time, are not the Pikes fit onely to take wounds, but not able to give any? Now, can they be held fit to safe-guard others, who cannot helpe or relieve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves?</p>
            <p>And thirdly, Is not the Pike-man as unfit for Convoyes, in respect of swift Marches: For Convoyes upon Intelligence of any Enemies approach, will haste away for safety and shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: now the Pike is not good for speed; and as they cannot goe apace from, so, nor can they pursue, with any speed, an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my when he hath affronted them; so that as they have been
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56719:43"/>
powerfull to purchase their booty, they have as large liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to goe off with their prizes, without feare of surprize or pursuit.</p>
            <p>And as the Pike is full of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage in respect of place, time, and marching; so, lastly, is it as insufficient in some cases to returne to their own leaguer againe: For if any Enemy hath heard of their marching by, may he not with a few Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers block up their passage for returne, so that their Generall had need to send out another Convoy of Fire-men to bring home his Pikes againe, or else he must give them for lost, or bee forc'd to ransome them, who, if they had been Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56719:44"/>
would have been able to have freed themselves.</p>
            <p>And to conclude: In an Army mix'd of Musquets and Pikes, why should not the one as well as the other performe services, and run equall hazards, seeing they are all alike ingag'd and interested in the same cause? which yet they cannot: For the Pike is so farre unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for any present service up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Enemy, that after ten a clock at night he is not reputed to be a sufficient Sentinell, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in any out-workes, as Halfe-moones, Horne-workes, &amp;c. For all the Alarum he can give, must be by word of mouth; which, at many times, especially if there be any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:56719:44"/>
betwixt his Centinels place, and the <hi>Corps-du-Guard</hi>; or else if the winde be high and blustring, or contrary (as many times it may be) cannot be well perform'd: And is not that a poore course to have 20000. men in field, and onely all, or at least the hardest service to be done by 10000. To what end need their persons be there, whenas they stand us in little, or no stead; for certaine, great are the inconveniences that have issued in publike services, by having either equall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, or such great store of Pikes with Musquets. But to goe on to other Arguments.</p>

            <head>SECT. VI. What a great disadvantage it is to have all the properest men to carry Pikes.</head>
            <p>BY Counsell (saith King <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>) make warre; 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Hinge of great servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: none are likely to be well manag'd without Policy and Advice. It hath been alwaies determin'd by able Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to have strong, hardy, lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, couragious, and active men to be set forth for Soldiers; and thereupon 'tis thought fit by Great States to give liberty to servants and Apprentices to use
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:56719:45"/>
publike exercises of Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Leaping, Running, Wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stling, Pitching the barre, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Swimming, Fencing, &amp;c. in the times of Peace, that in the times of warre they may choose men of lively and active spirits, to doe their King and Country service.</p>
            <p>Which course cannot be by discreet men reproved: But the mistake followes; that when such men are appointed for service, and chosen for war, then the Officers make choice of the tallest, and, to all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, of the strongest men to be for Pike-men. Now 'tis certaine, were the weapons as serviceable as the men, it might be good in consequence; but
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:56719:46"/>
here 'tis cleane otherwise: for the men, though apt and ready for service, are yet mainely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by the Armes they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to use: for to speake plainly, what reason is it, while that others can send the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Death to their Enemies at a large distance, Pikes onely cannot? and while others are discharging their Bullets, these may stand and looke on onely, not being able to doe any thing.</p>
            <p>Now it shall plainly appeare what a great disadvantage it is to an Army, to tye such able men to such a kinde of weapon which cannot affront an insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting foe: for, doth it not spurre on the Enemy to take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:56719:46"/>
whenas he knowes we cannot hurt him? and will he not have matter enough to laugh at, to see our Pikes stand charg'd, and to sinke down shot in their Rankes by their Pistols or Musquets, and no waies able to answer like for like; as is plaine in this Instance.</p>
            <p>Whenas the Town of <hi>Stoade</hi> was beleaguer'd by the forces of Count <hi>Tilly</hi> and others, and defended by the <hi>English</hi>; for a good while we kept many Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes and Scoutes without the walls: It so fell out, that many Musquetiers being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in other services, and being, by reason of the perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of the Citizens, forced at all times to leave a sufficient
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56719:47"/>
number within, lest they should have betrayed the Towne; that there were an 100. or an 150. Pike-men, able, stout, expert, and well arm'd, appointed (with some few Musquetiers) to keepe a Scout not farre from the Towne: whereas 'twas thought there was little or no danger to be feared, came it not to passe, that the Enemy (ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving about to spy all advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) march'd that very night against that Scoute which was mann'd chiefly with Pikes; the Alarme was taken first by one of our Pike-men, by the sight of a Dogge, which (as he sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and so all the rest) came not alone; which proved true: for presently the Enemy gave
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:56719:47"/>
fire, and hearing but one or two discharge from the Scout, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that we had either left the worke, or else were asleepe, and so unable to resist: 'twas true, that when the Enemy had twice or thrice furiously given fire, our men did retreate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the towne; but upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice given to our Generall, they were charg'd to maintaine and defend the worke, and to beat out the enemy againe: so they going on, did by their sudden returne, and the darknesse of the night, terrifie the Enemy so that they left their easie gotten purchase for a time (supposing that either we had increased our numbers, or else might have some plot to encompasse them
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:56719:48"/>
in:) but hearing no further pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit, made a stand; and upon advice set upon the Scoute the second time, wherein they made a fearefull slaughter, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting our men which were shot into the fire one upon another; kill'd and burn'd all that stood it out, shot divers of them who cast away their Armes to save themselves by swimming: so that we lost most, or almost all our men.</p>
            <p>Now was not this an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall fight, to set Pikes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Musquets? And had these men had Musquets, they would have defended that worke against double so many Musquetiers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming on. This was much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:56719:48"/>
but the losse was unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable.</p>
            <p>Nor yet will any impute any indiscretion to our Generall: for this Act could not at that time have been remedied, most of our Musquetiers doing daily service in all places, both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without the Towne, and halfe our forces almost (if not altogether) were Pikes; who, when they perceiv'd how that the heat of duties lay all upon the Musquet, did all of them very well like of their weapon, because it freed them from the most dangerous and forlorne places; which incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience as soone as it was so deerly understood, was reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died; and most of our Pike-men
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:56719:49"/>
were urg'd to use the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet; and such as did not, were adjudged to be Cowards, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they deserved.</p>
            <p>And it must needs be a great disadvantage to an Army to be so set forth: whenas, first, the Musquetiers cannot amount to those numbers that otherwaies they would; and so in case the Enemy outvy us in numbers (as usually they doe) how hard service must needs lie upon the small quantity of Musquetiers that we have: and if they be daily forc'd to fight, what help or assistance can they expect from their fellow Pikes, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that though they would, yet they could not relieve in respect of their Armes?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:56719:49"/>And it hath done, and will cause great complaints and murmurings dayly amongst Soldiers, whenas the Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers perceive that the Pikes u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually are like men priviledg'd or exempted from Sallies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyes, Skirmishes, Onslaughts, all dangerous and tedious En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes, especially to beat out an Enemy from a worke, or to gaine a passage and keep it; for in all these and many other the like services, the Pike may rest in his Quarters, and onely the MusqÃ¹et must out (if we meane to speed in what we undertake) may it not produce heart-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings amongst Soldiers, to see some in a manner doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, while the whole heat of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:56719:50"/>
the day lies upon, and is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone by others? Now seeing the service doth equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne all, why should not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>every sworne servant doe his taske.</p>
            <p>Brieflly, concluding that the highest and chiefest service for Honour is either going on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an Enemy, or lying downe before him, or else re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating from him; it shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to all, that in all these Considerations our great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Pikes is a gret disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us.</p>
            <p>For first, suppose that we are marching against the Enemy, any one of experience knowes that there will fall out sundry skirmishes and Salutes, much
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:56719:50"/>
playing by Partees as well of ours as of their men, before we can come to take a view of their Body in grosse, or they of ours. Now this cannot be done by Pike-men, for the fight is yet at distance, and so unfit for them: 'tis quickly and suddenly done, and usually in such places where the Pike-man will scarce have liberty to manage his arms: and to speake truth, what was it but to expose the lives of so many Pikes to the mercy of the Enemies shot, if they should be set out? and doth not the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by such discover that we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are but few Musquetiers, or else we would never have begun the fight with Pikes. And I may justly speake it, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:56719:51"/>
those who carry Pikes intend not to hurt the Enemy untill they have parlyed with him; for though they may be ready and resolv'd to fight a great way off, yet they cannot, untill they come close up to them; which priviledge (I believe) the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being Musquets, will not afford them.</p>
            <p>Then secondly, if it be to lie against an Enemy, in case we keepe any watch in Outworks, as (for the better safeguard of the Army) we usually doe; then if the watch be set with 200. men, halfe of them Musquetiers and halfe of them Pikes; if any service be perform'd, I doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that it must be all done by the Musquets; for to what
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:56719:51"/>
purpose should the Pikes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard themselves, whenas they are not within reach to offend: so that I suppose (excepting onely their doing service by standing Centinell) that there are but 100, in the place to beat the Enemy; and therefore it hath been seen in service (even in Trenches) when the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetier hath been giving fire furiously upon the Enemy, that the Pikes have sate safe in the Trenches, taking Tobacco, or telling tales, as though the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had not any wayes concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them.</p>
            <p>And lastly, if it be to make a Retreat from an Enemy (which includes a great deal of honor, valor, and skill;) for it must not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:56719:52"/>
be done dishonorably, confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly, or cowardly, (especially if the Enemy pursue,) but with good Intelligence, resolved Hearts and singular Policy: for Cowards run away, but valiant and wise Soldiers make retreats from a Foe. Is it not manifest that even at this time also the Pike proves disadvantageous? for 'tis to be concluded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, that the Enemy follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will not make assaults upon us with Pikes, but with Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, Carbines, and Pistols, and will any man of experience judge our Pikemen fit instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to beat off such fiery Blades? For if the Horse fall on (as usually they are the quickest for pursuit, and terriblest for
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56719:52"/>
charge) it cannot be held safe to put our Pikes in the Reare to keepe them off; for the Pikes must stand, they cannot well come off, or follow the other part of the Army, unlesse they intend to go backward charg'd, and how ridiculous would such a Posture prove? so that of force we must send able Fire-men to learne the horse to keep aloofe, or else we should seeme very unkinde to our fellowes, to leave them to such mortall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: And if so, then the old rule is true, <hi>Frustra fit per plura quod fieri potest per pauciora,</hi> Two are needlesse where one will serve the turne. But it is cleere that the Pikes cannot, and therefore the Musquer must.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:56719:53"/>Or if (as in <hi>Germany</hi> we had experience of it) the Enemy follow with Horse-men, and every Horse-man carrying a Musquetier behind him (which may be done to win ground of them whom they intend to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit, for foure legs will rid more ground then two) I desire to know what good our Pikes can doe, whenas our Enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to keepe out of the Pikes reach, and yet be within length to effect what they came for? So that we (if we intend to get off fairely) must doe it by pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing good stout Musquetiers in our Reare, who (like <hi>Parthians</hi>) can fight and fly, or (as we say) can give fire and retreat: thus had our Army faine to doe
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56719:53"/>
when we came off from the <hi>Long-live,</hi> being followed close by the <hi>Imperiall</hi> Horse, each of them bringing a Musquetier with him, untill we enquarter'd at the <hi>Berke</hi> not far from <hi>Breme:</hi> which could not have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, had we not maintain'd our Reere (not with Pikes) but with stout shot.</p>
            <p>And that was held the best Method in our marching from our Quarters at the <hi>Berke</hi> along to <hi>Stoad</hi>; for we left 150. or 200. resolute fire-men in a work to finde the Enemy play, whilst the maine of our Army gain'd almost a whole dayes journey; neither was it a slow March to shew State, or refresh the Soldier, (for our safety lay
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56719:54"/>
in our speed;) but it was quick and hasty, so that those which were left behind were of most reputed for lost men, and all supposed that had not Captain <hi>Hamonds</hi> Company received the Enemy comming after us, though to the losse almost of all his Soldiers lives, that our men had been served with the same sauce, (the Enemy intending us for slaughter as well as his men) yet those few men taking the best opportunity in such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate straight, and having a good guide, recover'd our Troopes againe. Now what service did our Pikes doe all this while? did they not cause our March to be the slower? and in case the Enemy had
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56719:54"/>
overtaken us (as it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally suspected he would) should not our. Musquetiers then have been the best defence for our Pike-men? and was it not the wish of all, that all our Pikes had been Fire-men<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and had not that Order been observ'd, we might have all been cut off before we could have entred into <hi>Stoad.</hi> So that it is evident enough what an hinderance it is to an Army to have the ablest men to be for Pike-men.</p>

            <p>WEapons should be to terrifie, not to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage an Enemy; to keep him off, not to allure him on: The very Ensignes and Colors have a Terror to amaze, (as King <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> hath it) <hi>Terrible as an Army with Banners.</hi> All war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Instruments are dreadfull; the Shield, the Sword, the Trumpet, the very Drums and

Fifes sound and beat feare and horror: for Soldiers are not for sport and jest, but for earnest: neither is Warre to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a May-game or Morrice-dance, but as a Plague and Scourge. Therefore in Warres Soldiers use offensive weapons to wound and destroy, such as can strike through the loines of all Opponents. And care is to be had, that as weapons should be made serviceable, so they should be made with all the Art that can be, to usher in death the speediest way.</p>
            <p>It was the saying of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> That <hi>she never fared better, then when she kept the</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard <hi>out at Daggers point:</hi> So it may be said in all warres, Tis
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56719:56"/>
never better with our Armies, then when we keep the Enemy at Distance; so that though he hath a desire to make attempts, yet knowing our Forces to be well arm'd, he shell nor dare to make approaches.</p>
            <p>The old <hi>Grecians</hi> had usually the advantage of their Enemies by virtue of their weapons: so 'tis knowne, that the <hi>Romans</hi> could not have subjugated so many Countries and Provinces had they not had great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of warlike Instruments more then of Numbers: And 'tis judg'd by able men, that the <hi>Norman</hi> Duke at <hi>Battle-Abbey</hi> won the day, and so the Crowne, by the excellency of his weapons; his Shields being
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56719:56"/>
made large for defence, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Pike of sharpened Iron without-side to wound and gore; so that they were his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes and Shields that made <hi>Harold</hi> and so many thousands of our Nation to fall slaine in that place. Invention herein is commendable: who knowes not how <hi>Archimides</hi> in <hi>Syra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuce</hi> by skilfull Engines by him made and invented, battered the <hi>Roman</hi> ships so, that <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus</hi> and all his stout <hi>Romans</hi> were strucke with amaze? And as worthy of perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is that of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight before the Maiden-town of <hi>Bulloigne,</hi> which device so daunted the Citizens, that at sight of his Engines they yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56719:57"/>
themselves and the Towne to the Kings mercy.</p>
            <p>Now let us examine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the Pike be a weapon of that worth and excellency, that it can keepe off the Enemy with any kinde of terror? or whether the multitude of them doth not rather hearten and hasten on the Enemy to assault? First, it is manifest that of it selfe it cannot keepe off neither Pistols nor Musquets: for, in case the Horse pretend an onset are not Commands given out presently to the Divisions of Musquets to draw out certaine files to beat off the horse which are fallen on the Pikes: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that should not the Pikes this way be speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56719:57"/>
what a fearefull slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would the Enemies Horse make, and what a speedy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock of our Pikes, without any prejudice to their owne Bodies or danger to their Horses: and cannot their Musquets doe as much? And certainely I should account it but folly in the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my (if he doth out-strip us in Horse, or in Foot-forces) not to set upon our Pikes: for who can hinder him from taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages? or why should not he make entrance at the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest place? But now marke the inconvenience that followes: If it be demanded, who beates off their Horse? you will say, our Musquets: then to what purpose serve the Pikes, but to
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56719:58"/>
cause many others to fall for comming in to helpe them? but that's not all neither; for, may not the sudden alteration of a form'd Battell cause an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the whole? for while there are Musquets drawn out of all Regiments to relieve the Pikes, doth not their drawing out weaken the strength of that Body out of which they came, which perhaps was before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermatch'd in numbers of the Enemies shot? and what is this but to draw out a great deale of good blood from a Body which may quickly perish for want of it?</p>
            <p>But yet further; if it be said our Pikes keepe off, or beat off the Enemies Horse, why then
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56719:58"/>
doe they retreat for our Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets? or why doe they not set upon our Musquetiers? or why need there be such sending for our Musquets to free the Pikes? for they were set upon, and were in danger, not the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets: and they were not able of themselves to spoile the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or safeguard themselves. Now I shall easily prove all this to be true, by this demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Admit we come 700. men into the field, thus ordered: 300. Pikes, 300. Musquetiers, and 100. Horse: The Enemy also comes with 700. but he hath no Pikes, but embattles with 500. shot, and 200. Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; will any now conclude,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:56719:59"/>
that because we are as many in Number as they, and as old, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd, resolute Soldiers as they, <hi>caeterisque paribus,</hi> that therefore thus ordered, we are able to maintaine fight with them? That we are not, I will prove.</p>
            <p>First, the Enemy hath 100. Horse to play with ours, and another 100. to play upon our Pikes, or to joyne with their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Troope to rout our Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which to all likelyhood they may being joyn'd in one, being 200. for 100. which if they doe, may they not then entertaine service against our Pikes, who at that pinch must be relieved, for they cannot helpe themselves against Pistol
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56719:59"/>
bullets, but must fall down shot in their Rankes and Files, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our ayd: Now the Enemy surmounts our numbers in shot when we are at most, being 500. to 300. Admit we send 100. from 300. Musquetiers, (which are as few as can be sent against such a power of Horse) but indeed too many to be sent from their fellowes; hath not the Enemy great advantage to be 500. Musquetiers against 200. or else may he not spare an 100. of his Musquets to play against ours who are sent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our Pike-men, and yet have the better against us, being still 400. against 200. and also be as able to foyle our Pikes as before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:56719:60"/>Or admit, secondly, that we have 400. Musquets, 200. Pikes and 100. Horse: and that the Enemy hath 600. Musquets, and 100. Horse: Are we in this state able to oppose them? It shall appeare briefly that we are not. Grant that our Horse answer theirs, yet may they not draw out 100. of their shot to foyle our Pikes, which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently be effected, and yet have (to all probability) the better of our Musquetiers, being 500. against 400.</p>
            <p>Now, in both these cases, if we be overcome and beaten, (as what hopes are there else, but that we shall?) I demand who were the cause? Let us sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose no defect in the Officers
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56719:60"/>
for matter of Direction or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; (nor any other advantage of Winde, or Sun, or Ground:) yet who may not easily perceive, that our great numbers of Pikes did procure our overthrow and ruine? For, what offence did our Pikes, or could they doe? none: Nay, they were not onely unable to offend, but as unfit to defend: so, that in plaine troth, they neither did hurt to the Enemy, nor good to themselves: this is as true in an Army consisting of many Thousands, as in one of certaine Hundreds. And certainly, our Forces may at all times defend themselves, and effect more against Enemies for the glory of our Nation, if they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:56719:61"/>
shall increase their Musquetiers, and lessen or take away their Pikes; for the Imperiall forces scarce have any: nor doe Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers desire to be troubled with that kinde of weapon; all are proud of their musquets, which yield more command to them than Pikes, and bring in more plenty of pillage.</p>
            <p>Now briefly, for the second, It may appeare to all, that our multitude of Pikes hearten the Enemy to charge: for, will it not be an incouragement, to fight against such who onely take, but cannot give wounds, whenas the Enemy perceives that he can come on, or goe off without danger of death to himselfe, and by discharging
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:56719:61"/>
at his pleasure sinke his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary even at his best posture for resistance: for, may it not be said of the Pike-man, that he would have kill'd his Enemy if his Pike would have reach'd him, or if he could have come at him? This was that that made the Imperiall forces so despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately often set upon our work because they knew it for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that wee usually man'd them with as many Pikes as Musquets. But I suppose I have spoken enough of this to satis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fie any judicious Soldier: And it is wished, that our Officers would augment their Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, they would finde that in any service they would be able to performe more than other
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:56719:62"/>
waies they can, or formerly have done: and it must needs give spirit to the Leaders, when they know that they have no cyphers, but all such Blades as thunder out death to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies at large distance: It would prove also to the Honor of their Prince, and Credit of themselves.</p>

         <div n="8" type="section">
            <head>SECT. VIII. To have equall numbers of Pikes to Musquets, or to have such great numbers of them, is a great Charge, and a Losse to the Prince that sets them forth.</head>
            <p>THough there be sundry Arguments to confirme
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:56719:62"/>
this subject, yet I hold this not to be the least: For, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the care that every one in particular ought to have to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the good of his Prince, it's held, that those which are intrusted in publike services of warre, are bound especially to study, and lay downe conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, how they may keep their Soveraigne freest from damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, seeing all the members strive and endeavour to defend their Head: and for certaine, such may be termed <hi>Cauponan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes Bellum,</hi> who ayme rather at their private gaines, than their Princes benefit. Now it shall plainely appear, that it is a great charge to a State to set forth as many Pikes as Musquets in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:56719:63"/>
publike services against an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
            <p>For first, the price of the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture for a Pike-man runnes higher then that of a Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier; the one is, and may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly now put in Armes fit for service for betwixt 22<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. or 24<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. at most; the other scarce under the rate of 35<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. even for the meanest and slightest sort of Armour. Now suppose the Army going out consists of 20000. men, halfe Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, and halfe Pikemen; the charge to the Prince for Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets will amount to, if valued at 22<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. the head, 11000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. or if at 24<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. the man, to 12000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. But the charge for Pikes at 25<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peece, will rise to the summe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:56719:63"/>
of 17500<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. at the lowest; so that had they all been Musquetiers, there had been 5500<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. saved to the Princes coffers: hence it is, evident, that there is a whole weekes pay reserved for the number of 20000. men, and 1500<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. overplus, at the rate of 5<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. the weeke for a Soldiers pay: and who can deny, but that this course is advantageous to a State?</p>
            <p>But now, if any shall say, But we will not have Pikes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall for number with Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, but let there be 15000. Musquets, and onely 5000. Pikes: yet who knowes not that the rate and charges still holds proportionably? For, 5000 Pike-mens furniture will
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:56719:64"/>
amount to as much as will set forth 8000. Musquetiers: the charge for the one (being after 35<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. the man) comming to 8750<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. And the cost for 8000. Musquetiers comming (after the rate of 22<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.) but to 8800<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. in all: So that there is in arming out 5000. Pikes, as much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burs'd as would have set out 8000. Musquetiers, within one 50<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. onely, which is nothing. Now were not the Musquetiers more necessary, it was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose; but if they be not, why should their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers be allowed for advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? Or if the Pikes be not so excellent, <hi>Parcatur sumptui,</hi> 'tis then good to save charges; or if not, yet to lay out monies
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:56719:64"/>
for those Arms which are most usefull.</p>
            <p>Then secondly, when both are ready furnish'd, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly arm'd; the maintaining the Pike with it's furniture, is a great deale more costly than that of the Musquet: And though care be had by the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier (which is rare) yet what by casualties and accidents, he can scarce ever be at all points rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and then if his furniture doe faile, it is harder and cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier to be repaired and mended then the Musquet: For proofe hereof, is it not manifest that Rainy weather rusts and spoiles a Corslet, but not a Musquet; or any little blow, or sudden touch many times breakes off a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:56719:65"/>
Pikes head, which makes it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unserviceable; as also the tases, with the hookes, buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, and other materialls, are quickly broke; and then the Corslet is unfitting for defence and unseemly to weare.</p>
            <p>Adde to these inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, That to be put upon long and quick Marches in hot Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer weather, with Armes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat as well for Pike as for Corslet, (and Soldiers are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and liable to such duties,) cannot but be wonderfull bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome, and the more by reason of the excessive heat which he is forc'd to suffer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as I may so say) imprison'd in his Armes; whereas the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetier marches with a great
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:56719:65"/>
deale of liberty, and is free and open to the aire, which is no small benefit and happinesse to him upon such occasions: And as these Armes are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome to the Soldier, so they are the more chargeable for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; for they take up, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy more waggons, waggo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers, and horses for draught, neither can they belayd up so closely or safely as Musquets may.</p>
            <p>And as the Pike out-vies the Musquet for charge and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersomnesse, so they cause more losse than Musquets; for though there goe as many out, yet there come fewer home: for, let the Officers lay ne're so strict a charge upon the Soldiers for
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:56719:66"/>
preservation of Armes, yet (upon advantages and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities offered) what by their running away, and what by their wearines upon long and hot marches, and so not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Army againe (being often cut off by the Boores, or Enemies parties that wait upon such occasions, or dying in the place there) many Pikes and Corslets are lost daily, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry; which casualties, as they are a weakening to an Army, so they prove a losse to the Prince: for, I suppose, the Captaines would be unwilling to answer the charges of all Armes that are lost these waies; neither indeed is it fitting that they should: for notwithstanding all their care
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:56719:66"/>
and vigilancy, yet these incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences doe, and will often happen in great Armies and long marches. The best course that I know how to remedy this losse and dammage, is, to furnish the Soldiers with Arms that are cheaper, lighter for carriage, and such as Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers will not be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily perswaded to part withall; and them (I hold) to be good Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, and half-pikes.</p>

            <head>SECT. IX. That if the Pike be still retained, yet to have all the Pike-men to be as well experienc'd in the use of the Musquet, as of the Pike.</head>
            <p>HAving sufficiently proved the Pike to be unusefull in military occasions in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Sections, I now come to shew one Particular, which is necessary to be put in practice, which is this; That in case for the present there shall not be a full discharge of the Pike, yet it is fit that all the Pike-men should be expert and able to use
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:56719:67"/>
the Musquet upon any need or occasion; which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed for these considerations following.</p>
            <p>First, that in case our Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers be too few in number for the Enemy, that then by this meanes they may have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies neere them to give them assistance; and 'tis but equity for one member to relieve an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and as much as it can to afford ease and supportment to it's fellow. Now, 'tis not fit that the Musquetier should per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme duty oftner, or harder then his Comrades; which yet he must needs do in marchings, Convoyings, Sallyings, &amp;c. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Pike-man upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion afford ease by exchanging
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:56719:68"/>
his Corslet for a Musquet.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Suppose we match and equalize the Enemy in Troopes of Horse, then for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there need not be any divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Pikes; for what shall they performe, when there are none to make opposition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them? And by this means we shall much increase our vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes of shot, which are indeed the glory and strength of our Army, and the onely instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to daunt the Enemy.</p>
            <p>Then thirdly, Is it not a great benefit to goe often out upon Convoyes, and Parties? And comes there not profit by freedome of pillaging, upon lawfull Command, in an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Country? And who acts
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:56719:68"/>
these services but the Fire-lock and Musquetier? For the Pike-man may play the part of a good huswife, stay at home up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on expectation what the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet will bring in; but cannot fetch in any thing of, or by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: so that unlesse (out of charity) the Musquetier be pleas'd to give him some part of his booty, he must either buy, or else want it; which he needed not have done, had he been furnish'd with the like weapons: this I have knowne to be true, in many places where our Leaguer hath been: And to speak truth, the Boores and Peasants of the Country are not terrified to yield their goods at the command of Pike-men;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:56719:69"/>
but will, and have made resistance (even to the losse of our mens lives) with their loap-staves, and other Country wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, because they have not seene Musquets to force their obedience and subjection.</p>
            <p>And to conclude; Doe not Pikemen, by being tyed onely to that sort of Armes, offer great injury to their Prince, to themselves, to their fellowes? For, is it not an injury to take pay, and yet doe not halfe so much labour and service as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? Why should they be maintain'd with equall pay to Musquetiers, whenas they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe not halfe such hazards? nor yet doe any notable exploit against the Enemy? For, let
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:56719:69"/>
any one by experience speak it; when any skirmish or set Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell hath, in these latter times, been ended, (upon the view of dead carcases) have there been found any quantity, or great numbers, who have received their deaths by the wounds gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Pikes? the slaughter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made, for the most, now with Musquets, Carbines, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stols and Swords. Now is it fit or just, that such chargeable Numbers should be kept on foot for doing nothing, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of others?</p>
            <p>And the injury is little lesse which they doe to themselves: for in any publike service they stand exposed to as much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nay many times to more
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:56719:70"/>
then divers others doe; for while they are not able to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, they are fit to be offended; and though they cannot send death to others, yet others can send it to them: Now is not this a wrong done to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that although they be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorous and able men, yet they willingly binde themselves to such Armes as are not offensive, and wil rather be killed in them then leave them for others which would much more beat off their foes, to the safety, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, of the whole Army, and to the greater security of their owne persons.</p>
            <p>Then lastly, The injury is great (if strictly considered) which they offer to others; for
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:56719:70"/>
whereas they put great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in them (as I believe they may for matter of courage and faithfulnesse;) yet they must needs faile their hopes upon necessity, in regard the Armes which they use, are not able to performe any great service: Now, their safety consists in the well comming off of the Musquetiers; for they failing, how long can these hope to stand sure? The Enemy will quickly command their throats at his mercy, if once the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet be foyled. And therefore to uphold the forces decaying and lessening, 'tis fit, that at least the Pike-men should have so much art, as to know how to handle the Musquet as well as
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:56719:71"/>
the Pike, skill and experience being no burthen to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; and the advantage and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which may come by thi<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">

Nature, at first, seemes like a project; every man will have an ill conceit of it, and as many as can will cry it downe, though they know not well what it is, or why they doe so. As first, I suppose,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> What's he that set it out to the world, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to prove it? or the like. To which I answer,</p>
            <p>First, That I am <hi>Iure Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, Accademico, Sacro, Bellico, Religioni, Principi, Patriae, Marti, Mercurio addictissimus:</hi> In plaine English, more I am not, lesse I am not.</p>
            <p>Now, why I had need to doe it, appeares, first, In that all the writers of Martiall affairs have kept silence in this one
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:56719:72"/>
particular; and is it not lawfull for me to make a discovery of what may in time conduce to the generall good of our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? A Mine of Gold is not therefore to be dislik'd, because 'twas no sooner found out: nor is any good thing therfore to be disparag'd, because it's lately disclosed.</p>
            <p>Then secondly, knowing by Experience, that in forraign services our Nation hath been disabled to performe such exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution as they might, in regard of the great multitude, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary number of Pikes which are put into our Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereas the Enemy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists most of Musquets, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually out-strips us in Numbers;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:56719:72"/>
and so hath perform'd more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, then we could against him.</p>
            <p>Now, that I am able to prove it, let but any Martialist read this Discourse, and lay aside all prejudicacy of Opinion; I doubt not, if he please to speak truth, (as a true-bred Soldier should doe) but that he will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my Positions to be just, and advantageous to publike servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. To come now to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments which seeme to plead for the necessity of Pikes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. Some argue the Pike to be full of Necessity, because of it's Antiquity; and 'tis pitty (say they) that a weapon which hath been so generally appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, and used with such ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:56719:73"/>
for so many hundreds of yeares should now be left off, seeing that it was used in Military oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions before the Musquet was ever thought upon. To which I thus reply:</p>
            <p>I will, and doe ingenuously confesse, that the Pike hath the priviledge of the Musquet in respect of it's Antiquity: But that's no safe conclusion, to say that all old things are the best, and that 'tis pitty to leave off an old Custome, meerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis so. Indeed, where Antiquity holds corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with present usefulnes, and when old things retaine their former necessity and benefit in after Ages, I hold they are not to be slighted, but honoured
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:56719:73"/>
and retained: But wherein 'tis found by experience, that the after-times have out-stript the former, and that the latter In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions are most excellent and usefull, then sure 'tis no Policy to be tied to the practice of our Fore-fathers. For example: Was not the Caliver &amp; Flasques all in use of late; but who knowes not that the Musquet and Bandileeres are now more easie, safe, and needfull. So, was not the Lance of prime ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence amongst Horse-men, yet now who will not preferre the Carbine and Pistolls? So Crosse-bowes were used in Sea-fights, but now the thundring bullets of Culvering and Demi-Canons gave discharg'd them.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:56719:74"/>
The Bow and Arrow, what a renowned weapon, and for long time how terrible, how victorious? yet not at all now used, but for recreation; though much more may be said for that then for the Pike. So that it is plaine, that the Pike is not therefore to be still used, only because it is so ancient a kinde of weapon: But that as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vary, so it may be either not us'd so much, or else not at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. There be divers that plead for the Pike, because it doth (say they) keepe off the Enemies Horse; and this they verily conclude is undeniable: nay, some are so confident of the truth of this, that they have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:56719:74"/>
disclosed to men of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and tryall, that they them selves never were in any reall service: hereupon they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Pike to be as good and necessary in earnest, as it seemes to be in jest. Well, I shall easily remove this strongly received Opinion.</p>
            <p>This is surely grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Tradition; and true it is, that in former times when the winged Cavalry were fenc'd with sword and lance onely, then the Pike had that virtue to keepe off their invading Horse, because the Lance was made 4. feet shorter then the Pike, the Pike being 16. and the Lance being but 12 foot long: So that of necessity, if the hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:56719:75"/>
intended execution upon them, they could not choose but hazard themselves, or hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, or both. But now the Horse having left off the Lance, and using their Pistols and Carbines in place of it, which can kill and sinke 120 yards off, and above; I would desire to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be any wisedome or safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to stand charg'd with Pikes onely against Pistoll bullets? for now the Horse having that advantage, need not approach so neere, as to endanger their owne bodies, or their Horses: And therefore it is high time for the Pike-men to looke after another weapon, which can and will better defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and offend their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:56719:75"/>
then their Pikes can doe. That's for the cleering that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. There be others that come in with another kind of Argument to supply (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they had need) the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Tenents: For they say, 'tis true indeed, that the Pikes alone of themselves cannot keep off the Horse; but being well lined and seconded with shot, then they can: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are very necessary in publike services.</p>
            <p>Now marke what the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of this will be: For if the Musquetiers beat off the Horse with their shot, what ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice do the Pikes all that while, hut onely stand for Cyphers?
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:56719:76"/>
and being unable to offend the Enemy, or by themselves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their owne, are faine to be succoured by the Musquet. Now can that be held an use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and necessary weapon, which of it selfe can neither of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Invader, nor yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Manager? I proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. Others maintaine, that the Pike is the most valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous kinde of fight, and the truest distinguisher of couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirits: for (say they) men are killed by the Musquet a great way off, and that now there is little or no man-hood tryed in the Warres, because any young stripling may with a Musquet kill the ablest and stoutest man in an Army; or
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:56719:76"/>
such who at handy-blowes (suppose with Browne-bills, Swords, or Pikes) would be able to beat downe three or foure such Punies: and therefore not the Musquet, but the Pike is the couragious manner of fight. I shall answer this briefly.</p>
            <p>Is the Pike therefore the more valorous kinde of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, because it playes closer and neerer then the Musquets usually doe? I trow not: for the close-fight may be performed by necessity; and for certaine, that man will never fight stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when the Enemy is neere, who dare not fight with him when he is at a good distance: and I shall ever approve him to be of spirit good enough, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:56719:77"/>
man able enough, who dare looke his Enemy in the face, notwithstanding the great and murthering volleyes of his shot. And it hath been seene, when young Striplinges have upon Commands gone resolutely forth by Sallies, in a dark, cold, blustring, rainy, tempestuous night, whenas a lusty, tall Pike-man hath been glad that he hath had such Armes allotted him, which kept him from such dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Onsets. Nay, upon sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine Alarmes in the Night, when the Serjeants have come to fetch men out of all Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to march out, with their usuall word, Up Musquetiers up; 10. or more out of every Company: At these times the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:56719:77"/>
lusty and able Pike-man hath said, Well, I would not be a Musquetier, I am glad of my Corslet, I had rather lye still in my Quarters, let the Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers get the honour, I desire it not at such times as this is: this hath been the language of the supposed valorous Pike-men, and I believe that they spake as they thought. Now what hinders, but that a young man may have as good a heart as a tall able man of person or limbs? Valour, as it is not tied or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the bulke, so neither to the age; little men and young men may be vigorous &amp; active, when great Bodies may be more dull and slow for action: the spirits in the one being (as
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:56719:78"/>
I may so say) imprisoned, desire alwaies to breake out into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances: but in the other they have such a spacious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty within, that they never urge to break forth: hence 'tis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly seene and allowed for truth, that little persons are the most nimble, fittest, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est for any waighty imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or hazards.</p>
            <p>And againe, what matters it whether a man kill or be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at a great distance, or hard by, so that he either gives satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to his Enemy, or else re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it from him. And I say further, that suppose the Sword and Pike be such a valorous kinde of fight as is pretended, yet before this can be perform'd
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:56719:78"/>
all parties must be first agreed; the Enemy must also be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to leave or lessen his Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, and come and fight with us neerer hand with Pikes; which will prove a difficult point to compasse: for, what have we to doe to tye or binde our Enemies to be conformable to our practice and customes? He, I doe verily believe, will in such cases be his owne Carver, and at his owne free choyce: so that if he findes that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailes most against us with Musquets, hee will not bee brought to use the Pike: So that <hi>AEnaeas</hi> speech to <hi>Turnus</hi> is out of date, â€”<hi>Pugnandum est comminus Armis.</hi> That's for satisfaction for that Argument.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:56719:79"/>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. But, say some, what that's strange, is the Pike un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usefull? Alas, who knowes not but that the Musquetiers may have spent all their powder and shot, and then woe unto us if it were not for our Pikes.</p>
            <p>This seemes to be an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolable Argument at the first view: but let it be well exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and it will prove other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. For certaine, wise Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls will not present themselves with their Armies for encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without sufficient furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and not one Musquetier of a hundred, who is not sped before he have emptied all his charges upon his Enemie. And in case all our powder and shot were spent, I desire to know
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:56719:79"/>
what great exploits our Pikes could performe, for they would be altogether unfitting to keep off the Enemies bullets? How long would they be able to stand it out, if once we had done? It is certaine that they would be reserved as a remnant for prisoners, or else for present slaughter, if the Enemy should deny them Quarter: for there would be little hopes to see the Enemies shot beaten out of the field by our Pike-men: 'twould prove a wonder to see or heare of such a kinde of victory pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by Pikes: this would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed make some plea for them. But when or where was ever that heard of? <hi>Dic quibus in terris?</hi> So that that Argument
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56719:80"/>
is no wayes valid and firme.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 6. There be yet others who are very stiffe to prove that the Pike is of singular vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and excellency in Trenches to keep the Enemy off, and to hinder him from entring for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably upon us in our workes.</p>
            <p>Now this was good if it could be made good<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices 'tis cleane otherwaies: for 'tis certaine if the Enemy have a minde to visit us in our Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, may he not the easlier enter by reason of our Pikes? for they stand in the place of a Musquetier, and fill up his room and yet cannot doe any thing against an Enemy, unlesse at a proportion'd distance onely: Now, if indeed the Enemies
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:56719:80"/>
Musquets had but power to kill at the like, then the Pike might effect his desire against him, but who knowes not but that the Enemy may stand off, and yet send death to the Pikes in case they shew their heads a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Trenches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 7. In the last place, there be many that hold that the Pikes are of singular use now, because there is much mention made of them in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ; for, say they, for certaine they would not have been used by such men, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in such a place, had they not had admirable virtue for management.</p>
            <p>This seemes to carry weight and force with it; and 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56719:81"/>
that often mention is made of the Pike or Speare, and Speare-men: <hi>Iob</hi> speaking of the great Leviathan, sayes that <hi>the Sword cannot touch him, nor will he rise for the speare nor Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergeon:</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> hath it, <hi>The multitude of the Speare-men, and such as delight in warre:</hi> And that Convoy which the chiefe Captaine sent along with St. <hi>Paul</hi> to bring him safe to <hi>Faelix,</hi> had 200 sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, 70 Horse-men, and 200 Speare-men: And our blessed Lords side was pierced with a Speare. All this is true; and yet it will not make for the Pike now.</p>
            <p>For though it was then u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, it may first be doubted
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:56719:81"/>
whether they were the same in forme as ours are, some reading Darts for Speares: But admit they were, yet 'tis unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable but that they were main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by others also; so that both parties used them in fight, and so there was no disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in them, but they might be serviceable, if they that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd them wanted neither skill nor courage: and in this respect there may be as much said for the use of great Shields and Bucklers; yet they are not used nor desired, unles by some persons of great eminency and quality, who have them carried by their Pages, more for state then use.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we see that the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:56719:82"/>
face of warre, and forme of weapons alter almost every day every Nation striving to out-strip each other in excellency of weapons: So that if it be found that other weapons are more forceable and prevalent in services then Pikes or Spears, 'tis not to be denyed but that they may be left, and others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained: So that as <hi>Horace</hi> said of old words, <hi>Quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula si volet usus,</hi> may be said of Pikes; After times having priviledge to use what weapons they finde most necessary for Defence and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; that being true, that if one kind of meat will not serve the stomach, any wise man will make choice of another; and if
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:56719:82"/>
one kinde of toole will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our worke, we may use and chuse that which will.</p>
            <p>So having answered all the Arguments that are urged for the defence of the Pike, I will shut up this Tract with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious discourse of the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet and halfe-Pike; wherein it shall appeare to all that please to read it, how usefull and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a weapon it is to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by one person, and that with great ease and safety, as shall appeare.</p>

            <head>SECT. XI. A compendious and briefe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the compleat and expert use of the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet and halfe-Pike.</head>
            <p>I Thought it not unfitting to end this Subject with adding some praise and commendation to that lately invented weapon of Musquet and halfe-Pike, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others that are yet extant: And I doe it the rather, because it may be as an incitement to our Nation to exercise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in this kinde of Armes. And though it cannot plead Antiquity, yet it may Safety
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:56719:83"/>
and Usefulnes: The latenes of it's invention being no disable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or disparagement for ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; being now with ease, and publike applause exercised by generous and heroick Martiall Spirits. There is not any that ever saw the management of it, but was ready to maintaine it, (if he had any skill in, or affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto Warlike exercises.)</p>
            <p>And I believe I may justly say it, that there can scarce be a fairer conjunction of Offensive and Defensive weapons to bee practis'd by one Soldier with such ease and pleasure, as the Musquet and halfe-Pike: For what could not (without a great deale of combersomnes) before be practis'd by Pikes and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:56719:84"/>
Musquets, may this way be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by one person, with more safety, and lesse danger and hazard to the Defendant. The benefit of it may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in these particulars fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It saves a great deale of charges laid out in Armes and Pikes; for a Soldier may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with these for as little as will buy a Pike: so that by this meanes all the charge for Cors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets and Head-pieces may bee saved, which in great Armies will amount to a mighty summe of money, and yet doe as much service for the Prince as they could before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Those weapons must needs be excellent which are so
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:56719:84"/>
advantageous to the Prince: for what need there be any Pike-men, whenas the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetier thus armed and accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, is able of himselfe to make good their roome: for he by this weapon is able at all times to keepe off the Horse if they should offer assaults, and yet give fire as well as otherwise, and be as ready for any sudden execution. Now, in the other, (though it should be said that to Pike-men keepe the Horse from running furiously upon our Rankes and Files,) yet it cannot be denyed, but their own persons are indanger'd by the Enemies volleyes of shot: In this the Horse are kept off, and the persons of the Soldiers
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56719:85"/>
secure, and able to revenge themselves freely upon their Adversaries. So that it is plaine that there may be as much ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice done by 1000. Soldiers thus accommodated, as there could before by so many more armed with Pikes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As 'tis advantageous in the two former respects, so is it as good for ease and safety to the Musquetier: for upon any occasion his halfe-pike may stand in stead for a Rest, and that used with comelinesse and decency, with gracefulnes and nimblenesse upon all postures as the Rest may, or can be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged: so that if a Rest be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted comely, decent, grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and nimble for a Musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:56719:85"/>
the same may the half-plke, because it hath all these qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations: but yet it is not onely serviceable as a Rest, but it is also full of safety to his person: for a Division of Musquetiers cannot be entred upon by any Horse-forces, because they stand barricadoed, as it were, within so many steel'd Palliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does: and may by a little retreat give fire to the utter destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such as shall dare to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front them: they being so made that they are fitting to fasten in any earth; and so light that they are carriagable in any place; and to any man of Armes usefull up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on almost all occasions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whereas most oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, stoutest resistances, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56719:86"/>
greatest hazards are made in entring breaches, (for usually most blood is spent there in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and offence, every one there ayming either to gaine or dye;) it is manifest that this weapon cannot choose but be of singular use: for (if managed with a stout heart, and a strong arme) it will force passage through the bodies of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; there being no resistance made against the Assailants, but with eminent danger of the Defendants lives.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Soldiers desire such wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons usually, which stand them in the most generall stead; and such as they can use in any place, or upon any service. Now 'tis certaine that the Musquet and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56719:86"/>
halfe-Pike are of that generall use, that they may be practis'd and managed upon all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyes, skirmishes, Retreats, Sallies, Onslaughts, &amp;c. For Convoyes, no safer posture for the Musquetier can be, then to be impaled within such fences and Barricadoes: and 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that any troopes of Horse can enter, before the Musquetiers can so fortifie themselves: for 'tis no great toyle or difficulty, but may quickly and speedily be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and can vary, alter, or change any way as the Enemy shall wheele about; so that the Reere may be as safe as the Front, and the Flanks as either.</p>
            <p>And as it is good for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyes,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:56719:87"/>
so 'tis excellent in skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes, for it fights with quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, advantage, and safety: and if they please to maintain their ground, who can force them to leave it? or if they be minded to retreat, who can gaine any thing by the pursuit? So that the Musquetiers thus armed, goe on with advantage, fight with terror, and retreat with honor. So for Sallies and Onslaughts, which are desperate kinde of services, none goe out with so much hopes to speed, as men so guarded; being (as I may ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie it) two Soldiers in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. And there is no such spur to make Soldiers valorous in Execution, as the the knowledg of the advantage they have of
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:56719:87"/>
their Enemies by the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their weapons.</p>
            <p>Briefly; for the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
               </gap> of this is better for Practice than Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: It cannot be denied, but that the Musquet and halfe-Pike is easily purchas'd, and as quickly for exercise to be learned: any Soldier may as soone be expert in the use of it, as he can of Musquet and Rest; nay sooner, if his Corporall or Commander have any skill to drill him to it. And (I say) let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one that either doubts of, or objects any thing against the excellency and benefit of this kinde of weapon, give but that Martiall Plot of ground, the <hi>Artillery Garden,</hi> a visit; and he shall and may receive ample sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56719:88"/>

               </gap> speake in praise of, and justifie the Invention as rare, and as yet I am sure by none paralelld: And 'tis to be wish'd that it was once general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne to our Nation; for the practice of it would prove wondrous advantageous. This I have spoken without flattery; for I would not doe so Noble and Heroick a Soldier as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor is, nor yet my selfe, that injury; Flattery being no waies compatible either to our, or their Profession. But I thought it an injury to so worthy a Member, if (notwithstanding all hit labour and ingenuity, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:56719:88"/>
with his charges) either He, or the Weapon should have been slighted or forgotten: It being a high degree of base In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, not to be thankfull for such generall benefits. But I have done; leaving both his dextrous Invention, and this Discourse to men of judgment in Armes.</p>

the weakest Armes in the field, how many soever they be; and much worse against the <hi>Turkes</hi> and other Nations, more powerfull in Horse (for which they are held to be good) which is not against Christians, and the reason is this. The pike offends not a far off, nor neere, except wee come to the incounter; it cannot make great way, nor pursue an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; when it retires cannot make you master of the field; they cannot be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from their squadrons, nor pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage with terror, they cannot force a street, guard a passage speedily, give a Camisado of a sudden, escarmouch or to make an assalt, and to use dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence on a March, with other feates of warre. <hi>And p.</hi> 106. <hi>he saith,</hi> That for these last 40 yeeres, the <hi>Turkes</hi> have gain'd upon the <hi>Hungarians</hi> &amp; other Christians (<hi>sempre in Ongaria</hi>) because they placed onely great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions of <hi>Switzish</hi> and <hi>High Dutch</hi>
