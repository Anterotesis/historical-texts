            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Complaints of want of Love and Vnity
among Christians, how to be mannaged,
and whence fruitless. Charge of Guilt
on some, why now remov'd, and for

Charge mentioned not agreed.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He great <hi>Differences</hi> that are
in the world amongst Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of the Gospel about things
relating to the Worship of
God, do exercise more or less
the minds of the Generality of men of all
sorts: For either in <hi>themselves,</hi> or their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents,</hi>
they are looked on to be of great
importance, Some herein regard principally
that disadvantageous influence which they
are supposed to have into mens <hi>spiritual and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57351:3"/>
Eternal</hi> Concernments: Others, that Aspect
which they fancy them to have upon the
<hi>Publick Peace</hi> and tranquility of this world.
Hence in all Ages such divisions have caused
<hi>great thoughts of heart;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judges 5. 15.</note> especially because it
is very difficult to make a right judgement
either of their Nature, or their Tendency.
But generally by all they are looked on as
<hi>evil;</hi> by some, for what they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
by others, from the disadvantage which
they bring (as they suppose) unto their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
interest. Hence there are amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great <hi>Complaints</hi> of them, and of that
want of <hi>Love</hi> which is looked on as their
cause. And indeed it seems not only to be
in the <hi>Liberty,</hi> but to be the <hi>Duty</hi> of every
man soberly to complain of the Evils which
he would, but cannot remedy. For such
complaints testifying a Sense of their <hi>Evil,</hi> and
a desire of their <hi>Cure,</hi> can be no more than
what Love unto the Publick Good requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
of us. And if in any case this may be
allowed, it must be so in that of <hi>Divisions</hi>
about sacred things, or the worship of God,
with their causes and manner of mannagement
amongst men. For it will be granted that
the Glory of God, the Honour of Christ,
the Progress of the Gospel, with the Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and peace of the Church, are deeply
<hi>concerned</hi> in them, and highly <hi>prejudiced</hi> by
them. And in these things all men have, if
not an <hi>equal,</hi> yet such a <hi>special</hi> interest, as
none can forbid them the due consideration
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57351:3"/>
of. No man therefore ought to be judged as
though he did <hi>transgress his Rule,</hi> or goe
beyond his Line, who soberly expresseth his
sense of their Evil, and of the Calamities
wherewith they are attended. Yet must it
not be denyed, but that much <hi>Prudence</hi> and
moderation is required unto the due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of such <hi>Complaints.</hi> For those
which either consist in, or are accompanyed
with <hi>Invectives</hi> against the Persons or ways
of others, instead of a Rational discourse of
the causes of such Divisions, and their Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
do not only open, enflame and irritate
former wounds, but prove matters of new
contention and strife, to their great increase.
Besides in the manifold Divisions and Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
of this nature amongst us, all men are
supposed to be under an adherence unto some
one <hi>Party</hi> or other. Herein every Man
stands at the same <hi>Distance</hi> from others, as
they do for him. Now all <hi>complaints</hi> of this
kind, carry along with them a tacit Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of those by whom they are made. For
no man can be so profligate as to judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
and the way of Religious worship where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he is ingaged, to be the cause of <hi>blaneable
Divisions</hi> amongst Christians, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
therein: Reflections therefore of <hi>Guilt</hi>
upon others, they are usually replenished
withall. But if those are not attended with
evident Light and unavoidable <hi>Conviction,</hi>
because they proceed from Persons, supposed
not indifferent, yea culpable in this very
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57351:4"/>
matter more of less themselves, by them
whom they reflect upon, they are generally
turned into Occasions of new exasperations
and contests. And hence it is come to pass,
that although all good men do on all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
bewail the <hi>want of Love,</hi> forbearance
and condescention, that is found among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of the Gospel, and the <hi>Divisions</hi> which
follow thereon, yet no comfortable nor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious
effects do thence ensue. Yea not
only is all Expectation of that blessed fruit,
which a general serious consent unto such
<hi>Complaints</hi> might produce, as yet utterly
frustrated; but the small remainders of Love
and Peace amongst us are hazzarded and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
by mutual charges of the want and
loss of them, on the Principles and Practices
of each other. We have therefore need of
no small <hi>Watchfulness</hi> and care, least in this
matter it fall out with us, as it did with the
<hi>Israelites</hi> of old,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 19. 41, 42, 43.</note> in another occasion. For
when they had by a sinful sedition cast out
<hi>David</hi> from amongst them, and from reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over them; after a little while, seeing their
folly and iniquity, they assembled together
with one consent to bring him home again.
But in the very beginning of their indeavours
to this purpose, falling into a dispute about
which of the <hi>Tribes</hi> had the <hi>greatest interest</hi>
in him, they not only desisted from their first
design, but fell into another distemper of no
less dangerous importance then what they
were newly delivered from. It must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57351:4"/>
that there hath been a <hi>sinful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of Love</hi> amongst Professors of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
in this Nation, if not a violent casting of
it out, by such prejudices and corrupt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
as wherewith it is wholly inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent.
And it would be a matter of no small
lamentation, if upon the blooming of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
for its Recovery and Reduction, with all
its trains, as <hi>forbearance, Condescention, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness</hi>
and <hi>Peace,</hi> if any such design there
be, by contests about the occasions and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of its Absence, with too much seriousness
in our own vindication, and pleas of a <hi>special
Interest in it</hi> above others, new distempers
should be raised, hazzarding its everlasting
exclusion.</p>
            <p>In this state of things we have hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
our selves with the <hi>Testimony of our
own hearts</hi> unto the sincerity of our desires,
as to walk in Love and Peace with all Men,
so to exercise the fruits of them on all occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
administred unto us. And as this alone
we have thus far opposed unto all those
Censures and Reproaches which we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
to the contrary; so therewithall
have we supported our selves under <hi>other
things,</hi> which we have also suffered. Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to declare our thoughts and Principles in
and about the worship of God, than they are
evidenced and testified unto, by our <hi>Practice,</hi>
we have hitherto forborne; least the most
moderate claims of an <hi>especial interest</hi> in the
common Faith and Love of Christians, should
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57351:5"/>
occasion new contests and troubles unto our
selves and others. And we have observed,
that sometimes an <hi>over-hasty indeavour</hi> to
extinguish flames of this nature, hath but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
and diffused them; when perhaps if
left alone, their <hi>fewel</hi> would have failed, and
themselves expired. Besides, a <hi>peaceable pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi>
especially if accompanyed with a quiet
baring of injuries, gives a greater conviction
to unprejudiced minds, of peaceable princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
and inclinations, than any <hi>verbal decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
whose sincerity is continually obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to the blast of evil Surmises. In a Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
therefore to the same purpose we had
still continued, had we not so openly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
been called on, either to vindicate
our <hi>Innocency,</hi> or to confess and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
our <hi>Evil.</hi> One of these we hope is the
aim and tendency of all those charges or
Accusations, for want of Love, peaceableness,
and due compliance with others, of being the
Authors and somentors of <hi>Schisms</hi> and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
that have been published against us,
on the account of our dissent from some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> For we
do not think that any good men, can please
themselves, in meerly <hi>accusing their Brethren,</hi>
whereby they add to the weight of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
troubles, and evidently expose them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
more. For every charge of <hi>Guilt</hi> on those
who are already under sufferings, gives new
incouragement and fierceness to the minds of
them from whom they suffer. And as no
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57351:5"/>
greater incouragement can be given unto
men to <hi>proceed</hi> in any way wherein they are
ingaged, then by their Justification in what
they have already done; so the only justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of those who have stirred up Persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against others, consists in charging <hi>Guilt</hi>
on them that are Persecuted. As therefore
we shall readily acknowledge any <hi>Evil</hi> in our
Persons, Principles or ways, which we are,
or may be convinced of; So the sober vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of Truth and Innocency, that none
of the ways of God be evil spoken of by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of us, is a Duty, in the care whereof
we are no less concerned. Yea did we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and directly indeavour our <hi>own Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
we should do no more than the prime
dictates of the Law of Nature, and the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of some of the best of Men, will give us
a sufficient warrant for. Besides the clearing
of <hi>Private Persons,</hi> especially if they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
from undue charges and false accusations,
belongs unto <hi>publick Good;</hi> that those who
have the Administration of it committed unto
them, may not be misled to make a wrong
Judgment concerning what they have to do;
as <hi>David</hi> was in the Case of <hi>Mephibosheth</hi>
upon the false suggestions of <hi>Ziba.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 4.</note> Neither
could we be justly blamed should we be more
than ordinarily <hi>urgent</hi> herein; considering
how prone the Ears of Men are to receive ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnious
Accusations concerning such as
from whom they expect neither Profit nor
Advantage; and how slow in giving admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57351:6"/>
to an address of the most modest defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sative.
But this is the least part of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Design. Our onely aim is to declare
those <hi>Principles</hi> concerning mutual <hi>Love</hi> and
Unity among Christians, and Practices in the
Worship of God, wherein our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
do find Rest and Peace, and others
have so much misjudged us about. This
therefore we shall briefly do; and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such Reflexions or <hi>Recriminations,</hi> as
may any way exasperate the Spirits of others,
or in the least impede that <hi>Reintroduction</hi> of
Love and Concord, which it is the Duty of
us all to labour in. Wherefore we shall
herein have <hi>no regard</hi> unto the Revilings,
Reproaches, and threatnings of them, who
seem to have had no regard to Truth, or
Modesty, or Sobriety, indeed to God or
Man, in the mannagement of them. With
such it is our Duty <hi>not to strive,</hi> but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
our cause to him that Judgeth Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
especially with respect unto those im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure
outrages <hi>which goe before unto Judgment.</hi>
Furious Persons, animated by their secular
Interests, or desire of Revenge, unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the Spirit of the Gospel, and the
true nature of the Religion revealed by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ incompassionate towards the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitics
of the minds of Men, whereof yet
none in the world give greater Instances than
<hi>themselves,</hi> who have no thoughts but to
trample under foot and destroy all that differ
from them, we shall rather pitty and pray for,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57351:6"/>
then either contend withal, or hope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
Such they are, as if outward preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
were added to their Principles and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
they would render all Christians like
the <hi>Moabites,</hi>

               <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and <hi>Edomites,</hi>
who came out to fight against <hi>Judah.</hi> The
two greater Parties upon some difference or
distaste, conspire at first to destroy the <hi>Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of Seir;</hi> not doubting but that when
they had dispatched them out of the way,
they should accord well enough among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
But the Event deceived their Expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
their <hi>Rage</hi> ceased not untill issued in
the mutual destruction of them all. No o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
would it be with those who want
nothing but <hi>force</hi> or opportunity to extermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
their next dissenters in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
For when they had accomplished
that design, the same Principle and <hi>Rage</hi>
would arm them to the wasting of the residue
of Christians, or their own. For a conceit
of the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> hereof, is raised from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of enlarging power and dominion, which
is boundless. Especially is it so, where an
Empire over the <hi>Reason,</hi> Faith and Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of men is affected; which first produced
the fatal Engine of <hi>Papal Infallibility;</hi> that
nothing also could have strained the wit of
man to invent, and nothing less can support.
Unto such as these we shall not so much as
tender satisfaction, untill they are capable of
receiving the advice of the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.
31. <hi>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57351:7"/>
and clamour, and Evil speaking, be put away
from you, with all Malice.</hi> For untill this be
done, men are to be esteemed but as <hi>raging
waves of the Sea, foaming out their own shame,</hi>
whom it is to no purpose to seek to pacifie,
much less to contend withall.</p>
            <p>It is for the Sake of them alone who really
value and esteem, <hi>Love,</hi> Peace, and Unity
among Christians for themselves, that we
here tender an account of our thoughts and
Principles concerning them. For even of
them there are some who <hi>unduely charge</hi> us
with owning of Principles, destructive unto
Christian <hi>Love</hi> and Condescention, and
suited to perpetuate the <hi>Schisms</hi> and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
that are amongst us. Whether this
hath been occasioned by an over-valuation
of their <hi>own Apprehensions,</hi> conceiting that
their judgments ought to give Rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to other mens; or whether they have
been, it may be insensibly unto themselves,
byassed by <hi>Provocations</hi> as they suppose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
given them, we are not out of hopes,
but that they may be convinced of their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes.
Upon their <hi>Indications</hi> we have sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
our <hi>Consciences,</hi> Principles, and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,
to find whether there be any such way
of perverseness in them, as we are charged
withall; and may with confidence say, that
we have a <hi>Discharge</hi> from thence, where we
are principally concerned. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
satisfied that Duty which on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
was in the first place incumbent on us,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57351:7"/>
we shall now for their <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and our
own <hi>Vindication</hi> with all impartial Men, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
what are our thoughts and Judgments,
what are our Principles, ways, and Pract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ices,
in and about the great concerns of
Christian Love, Unity, and Peace; referring
the final decision of all differences, unto
him, who <hi>hath appointed a day wherein he will
judge the World in Rightcousness, by the Man
whom he hath ordained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being our present Design, none may
expect, that we should attempt to justifie or
excuse, any of those <hi>miscarriages</hi> or failings
that are charged on <hi>some,</hi> or <hi>all</hi> of those
Professors of the Gospel, who at this Day
come not up unto full Communion with the
<hi>Church of England.</hi> For we know that <hi>no
man liveth and sinneth not;</hi> yea that in <hi>many
things we all offend.</hi> We all know but in
part, and are liable to manifold Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
even all such as are common unto Men.
Those only we have no esteem of, who
through the feaver of Pride have lost the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
of their own weak, frail, and
sinful condition. And we do acknowledge,
that there are amongst us, <hi>Sins against the
Lord our God,</hi> for which he might not only
give us up unto the Reproaches and Wrath
of Men in this World, but himself also cast
us off utterly and for ever. We shall not
therefore in the least <hi>complain</hi> of those who
have most industriously represented unto the
publick view of the world, the weakness
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57351:8"/>
               <hi>miscarriages,</hi> that have really fallen out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
some or more of them whose Cause
we plead, and discovered those <hi>corrupt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
from whence, helped on with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Temptations, they might probably
proceed; Nor shall we use any Reflections
on them who have severely, and we fear
<hi>Maliciously</hi> laid to their charge things which
they know not; as hoping that by the former
the Guilty may learn what to amend, now
they are taught with such thorns and briers as
are the scorns and reproaches of the World;
and by the latter the Innocent may know
what to avoid. Such charges and Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
therefore we shall wholly pass over,
with our hearty prayers that the same or
<hi>worse evils</hi> may never be found amongst them
by whom they are accused. Much less shall
we concern our selves in those Reflections on
them, which are raised from the <hi>Words, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions,</hi>
or Actions of particular Persons,
as they have been reported and tossed up and
down in the <hi>Lips of talkers.</hi> The debate of
such things tends only to mutual exasperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and endless strife. It may be also, that
for the most part, they are <hi>false,</hi> or misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
inviduously, or misapplyed; and
true or false, have been sufficiently avenged
by severe retortions. And in such <hi>Alterca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
few men understand the sharpness of
their own words. Their <hi>Edge</hi> is towards
them whom they oppose: But when a return
of the like Expressions is made unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57351:8"/>
they are sensible how they pierce.
So are provocations heightened, and the
first intendment of reducing <hi>Love,</hi> ends in
mutual defamatory contentions. All things
therefore of this nature, we shall pass over,
and help to bury by our Silence.</p>
            <p>The principal charge against us, and that
whereinto all other are resolved, is our <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformity
unto the present Constitutions of the
Church of England.</hi> For hence are we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
to be guilty of the want of Christian
Love and peaceableness, of <hi>Schism,</hi> and an
inclination to all sorts of Divisions, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Rules and Precepts of the Gospel.
Now we think it not unreasonable to desire,
that those who pass such censures on us,
would attend unto the <hi>common known Rule,</hi>
whereby alone a right Judgment in these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
may be made. For it is not equal that
we should be concluded by other Mens par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Measures,</hi> as though by them we
were to be regulated in the exercise of Love,
and observance of Peace. And as we doubt
not but that they fix those <hi>measures</hi> unto
themselves in sincerity, according unto their
own Light and Apprehension of things; so
we are sure it will be no impeachment of their
<hi>Wisdom</hi> or <hi>Holiness,</hi> to judge that others
who differ from them, do with an equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
indeavour the direction and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of their Consciences, in what they
believe and Practise. Yea, if they have not
pregnant evidence to the contrary, it is their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57351:9"/>
duty so to judge. A defect hereof is the
spring of all that want of Love, whereof so
great a <hi>Complaint</hi> is made. And rationally
they are to be thought most sincere and scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
herein, who take up with determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
that are greatly to their <hi>outward</hi>
disadvantage. For unless it be from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
of present Duty with respect unto
God, and their own <hi>eternal</hi> Good, men are
not easily induced to close with a judgment
about sacred things and religious Worship,
which will not only certainly prejudice them,
but endanger their ruine, in things <hi>Temporal.</hi>
It is <hi>ordinarily,</hi> outward secular Advantages
wherewith the Minds of Men are generally
too much affected, that give an easie admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
unto Perswasions and Practices in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
By these are Men turned and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
every day from what before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed;
when we hear of no turnings unto a
<hi>suffering profession,</hi> but what arise from strong
&amp; unavoidable convictions. Moreover should
we indeavour to accommodate our selves
to the <hi>Lines</hi> of other Men, it may make some
change of the Persons with whom we have to
doe, but would not in the least relieve us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the charges of <hi>guilt of Schism</hi> and want
of Love which we suffer under. Some would
prescribe this <hi>Measure</hi> unto us, that we should
<hi>occasionally joyn with Parish Assemblies</hi> as now
stated in all their worship and sacred Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations;
but will not require of us that
we should absolutely forbear all other ways
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57351:9"/>
and means of our own Edification. Will
this <hi>Measure</hi> satisfie all amongst us? will
it free us from the imputation we suffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?
shall we not be said any more to <hi>want
Christian Love,</hi> to be <hi>factious</hi> or guilty of
Schism? It is known unto all how little it
will conduce unto these Ends, and how little
the most will grant that <hi>Church Peace</hi> is
preserved thereby. Yea the <hi>Difficulty</hi> will
be increased upon us beyond what an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Ability can solve, though we doubt
not but that it may be done. For if we
can do <hi>so much,</hi> we may expect justly to be
pressed severely to answer, why we do <hi>no
more.</hi> For others say immediately, that our
Attendance on the publick Worship must be
<hi>constant,</hi> with a forbearance of all other ways
of Religious worship beyond that of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
yet this they would have us so to doe, as
in the mean time studiously to indeavour the
<hi>Reformation</hi> of what is judged amiss in the
Doctrine, Discipline, and Worship of the
Church. This is the <hi>measure</hi> which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
unto us by some; and we know not
how many censures are passed upon us for a
<hi>nonconformity</hi> thereunto. Will therefore a
complyance unto this length better our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition?
will it deliver us from the severest
<hi>Reflections</hi> of being Persons unpeaceable and
intolerable? shall we live in a perpetual <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulation</hi>
of our Judgments as to what need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Reformation? will that answer our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
or give us peace in our latter End?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57351:10"/>
Shall we <hi>profess</hi> the perswasions of our minds
in these things; and indeavour by all Lawful
means to accomplish what we desire? shall
we then escape the severest censures, as of
Persons <hi>inclined to Schisms</hi> and Divisions?
Yea many great and wise Men of the <hi>Church
of England</hi> doe look on this as the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Principle and Practice that any can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
themselves unto.<note place="margin">Heyl. Hist of Presb.</note> And in reporting the
<hi>Memorials</hi> of former times, some of them
have charged all the calamities and Miseries
that have befallen their Church, to have
proceeded from Men of this Principle, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
<hi>Reformation</hi> according unto Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
of their own, without <hi>Seperation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And could we conscientiously betake our
selves to the pursuit of the same Design, we
should not, especially under present jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and exasperations, escape the same <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi>
that others before us have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone.
And so it is fallen out with some, which
might teach them that their measures are not
<hi>authentick;</hi> and they might learn Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards them who cannot <hi>come up unto
them,</hi> by the security they meet withall, from
those that <hi>do out go them.</hi> Shall we therefore,
which alone seems to remain, proceed yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and making a Renunciation of all those
Principles concerning the Constitution, Rule,
and Discipline of the Church, with the ways
and manner of the Worship of God to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in the Assemblies of it, come over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>full Conformity</hi> unto the present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57351:10"/>
of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all
the proceedings of its Rulers thereon? Yea
this is that, say some, which is required of
you, and that which would put an End un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all our Differences and Divisions. We
know indeed that an <hi>Agreement</hi> in any thing
or way, right or wrong, true or false, will
promise so to do, and appear so to do, for
a season: But it is <hi>Truth</hi> alone that will make
such Agreements durable, or useful. And
we are not ingaged in an inquiry meerly
after <hi>Peace,</hi> but after <hi>Peace with Truth.</hi>
Yea to lay aside the Consideration of <hi>Truth,</hi>
in a disquisition after <hi>Peace</hi> and Agreement
in and about spiritual things, is to exclude
a regard unto God and his Authority, and
to provide only for our selves. And what
it is which at present lays a <hi>Prohibition</hi> on our
Consciences against the compliance propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
shall be afterwards declared; neither
will we here insist upon the discouragements
that are given us, from the present state of
the Church it self, which yet are not a few.
Only we must say, that there doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
unto us in many that steadiness in the
profession of the <hi>Truth</hi> owned amongst us
upon, and since the Reformation, nor that
consent upon the Grounds and Reasons of the
Government and Discipline in it, that we
are required to submit unto, which were
necessary to invite any dissentors to a through
Conformity unto it. That there are daily
inrodes made upon the <hi>ancient Doctrine</hi> of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57351:11"/>
this Church, and that without the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trole
from them who pretend to be the sole
Conservators of it, untill, if not the whole,
yet the principal parts of it are laid waste,
is sufficiently evident, and may be easily
proved. And we fear not to own, that we
cannot conform to <hi>Armianism, Socinianism,</hi>
on the one hand, or <hi>Popery</hi> on the other, with
what new or specious pretences soever they
may be blended. And for the <hi>Ecclesiastical
Government,</hi> as in the hands of <hi>meer ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Persons,</hi> when it is agreed among
themselves, whether it be <hi>from Heaven or
of Men,</hi> we shall know the better how to
judge of it. But suppose we should wave
all such considerations, and come up to a
<hi>full Conformity</hi> unto all that <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>shall,</hi> or
<hi>may</hi> be required of us; will this give us an
universally pleadable acquitment from the
charges of the Guilt of want of Love, Schism
and Divisions? We should indeed possibly
be delivered from the noyse and <hi>clamour</hi> of
a few, crying out <hi>Sectaries, Phanaticks,
Schismaticks, Church-Dividers;</hi> but withal
should continue under the censures of the
great, and at present thriving <hi>Church of Rome,</hi>
for the same supposed Crimes. And sure
enough we are, that a compliance with them
who have been the real causes and occasions
of all the <hi>Schisms</hi> and Divisions that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gst
Christians almost in the whole world,
would yield us no solid relief in the change
of our condition. Yet without this no Men
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57351:11"/>
can free themselves from the <hi>loudest outcries</hi>
against them on the account of <hi>Schism.</hi> And
this sufficiently manifests how little indeed
they are to be valued, seeing for the most
part, they are nothing but the <hi>steam</hi> of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
and Party. It is therefore apparent
that the Accommodations of our Judgments
and Practices to the <hi>measures</hi> of other men,
will afford us no real advantage, as to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
we suffer under; nor will give sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
unto all Professors of <hi>Christianity</hi>
that we pursue Love and Peace in a due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:
For what <hi>one sort</hi> requireth of us, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
will instantly disallow and condemn.
And it is well if the Judgment of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
Part</hi> of all sorts be not influenced by
Custome, prejudices, and secular Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
We have therefore no way left, but
that which indeed ought to be the <hi>only way</hi>
of Christians in these things; namely to seek
in sincerity the satisfaction of our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
and the approving of our hearts
unto the search of them, in a dilligent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
unto our own especial Duty, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that Rule which will neither, deceive
us, nor fail us. And an Account of what we
do herein, we shall now render unto them
that follow Truth with Peace.</p>

            <p>THe Foundation of our discourse might
be laid in the commendation of <hi>Christian
Love,</hi> and Unity; and thereon we might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
enlarge; as also abound in a collection
of <hi>Testimonies</hi> confirming our Assertions.
But the old reply in such a Case, <hi>by whom
ever were they discommended</hi> evidenceth a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
therein to be needless and superfluous.
We shall therefore only say, that they are
greatly mistaken, who from the <hi>Condition</hi>
whereunto at present we are <hi>driven</hi> and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated,
do suppose that we value not these
things at as high a Rate as themselves, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other Professors of Christian Religion in
the world. A greater <hi>noyse</hi> about them may
be made possibly by such as have accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their name and notion to their <hi>own Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sts,</hi>
and who point their Pleas about them,
and their pretences of them, to their own se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Advantage. But as for a real valuation
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57351:12"/>
of the <hi>things themselves,</hi> as they are required
of us, and prescribed unto us in the Gospel,
we shall not willingly be found, to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
any that own the name of Christ in the
world. We know that God hath stiled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
the <hi>God of Love, Peace and Order,</hi> in
the Church, because they are eminently from
him, and highly accepted with him. And
as <hi>Love</hi> is the <hi>new Commandment</hi> which <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ</hi> hath given unto his Disciples, so
he hath appointed it to be the <hi>bond of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
unto them; which nothing else will ever
be, however <hi>finely invented</hi> for them, or
<hi>forceably imposed</hi> on them. Without this
<hi>Love,</hi> in what relates to Church Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whatever else we are, we are but as <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
brass and tinkling Cymbals.</hi> And all
<hi>Vnity</hi> or Agreement in outward order not
proceeding from, and animated by this <hi>Love,</hi>
are things wherein neither Christ nor the
Gospel are much concerned.<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 2.</note> An indeavour

               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 10.</note> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
all Believers, for a help unto us, to
keep the <hi>Vnity of the spirit in the bond of
Peace,</hi> we acknowledge to be indispensably
required of us. And therefore where any
<hi>Opinion,</hi> or <hi>Practice,</hi> in or about Religion
or the worship of God, do apparently in
themselves impair the Gracious holy princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Love and Peace, or obstruct Men in
the Exercise of any Duties which those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
require or lead unto, it is a great and
weighty prejudice against their Truth, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57351:13"/>
Acceptation with God. As therefore we
shall not boast of the <hi>prevalency</hi> of these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
in our minds; seeing that though we
should <hi>know nothing</hi> to the contrary by <hi>our
selves, yet are we not therefore justified;</hi> so
we are assured that none can justly condemn
us, for the want of them, unless they can
make good their charge by Instances not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the peculiar Differences, between
them and us. For what <hi>doth so,</hi> will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
warrant any to make such a Judgment,
nor carry any <hi>Conviction</hi> in it towards them
that are judged. Upon the whole matter,
we shall not easily be diverted from pursuing
our claim unto an <hi>equal Interest</hi> in these things
with any other Professors of the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
although at present we do it not by
enlarged Commendations of them. Much
less are we in the least moved or shaken in our
Minds from the <hi>Accusations</hi> of them, who
having the Advantage of Force and Power,
do make a Compliance with themselves, in all
their <hi>impositions</hi> and self-interested Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the sole measure of other mens exercise
and actings of these Principles. We have a
much safer Rule whereby to make a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them, whereunto we know we <hi>shall
do well to attend, as unto a Light shining in
a dark Place.</hi> But now whereas all these
things, namely <hi>Love, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Vnity,</hi> are
equally dear unto us; yet there are different
Rules prescribed, for the Exercise and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of them. Our <hi>Love</hi> is to be <hi>Catholick,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:57351:13"/>
unconfined as the beams of the Sun, or as the
showrs of rain that fall on the whole Earth.
Nothing of Gods Rational Creation in this
world, is to be exempted from being the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
thereof. And where only any Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might seem to be warranted by some
Mens causeless hatred, with unjust and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
persecution of us, there the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of it is given us in <hi>especial and strictest
charge;</hi> which is one of the noble singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Christian Religion. But whereas men
are cast into various conditions on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Relation unto God, the actual
exercise of Love towards them is required of
us in a suitable variety. For it is God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in his Infinite Excellencies, who is the
first and <hi>adequate</hi> Object of our Love; which
descends unto others according to their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipations
from him, and the especial Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
created by his Appointment; whereof
we shall speak afterwards. Our Duty in
the Observance of <hi>Peace,</hi> is, as unto its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
equally extended. And the Rule or
<hi>Measure</hi> given us herein, is the utmost of our
indeavours in all ways of Truth and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
which are required, or may have a
tendency thereunto. For as we are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

               <hi>and as far as in us
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:57351:14"/>
lieth, to live peaceably with all Men.</hi> The
Rule for <hi>Vnity,</hi> as it is supposed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
all Church Communion, falls under
many Restrictions. For herein the especial
Commands of Christ, and <hi>Institutions</hi> of the
Gospel committed unto our Care and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance
falling under consideration, our
Practice is precisely limited unto those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and by the nature of those Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>These being the things we are to attend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and these being their general <hi>Rules</hi> and
measures, we shall with respect unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state of Religious Affairs in the world,
amongst those who make Profession of the
Christian Religion, plainly declare what are
our thoughts and Judgments, what we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be our <hi>Duty,</hi> and what is our Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
submitting them unto the present Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of unprejudiced Persons, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the <hi>final Sentence</hi> and determination
of our Cause to the Judgment-Seat of Jesus
Christ.</p>
            <p>Love toward all <hi>Mankind in general</hi> we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to be required of us; and we are
<hi>Debtors</hi> in the fruits of it to the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of God. For he hath not only implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>Principles</hi> of it in that nature whereof
we are in common Partakers with the
whole Race and Kind, whereunto all hatred
and its Effects were originally <hi>forreign</hi> and
introduced by the <hi>Devil;</hi> nor only given us
his <hi>Command</hi> for it, enlarging on its grounds
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57351:14"/>
and Reasons in the Gospel; but in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of recovering us out of our lapsed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
unto a Conformity with himself, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
in an especial manner the Example of
his <hi>own Love</hi> and Goodness, which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
unto all, for our imitation. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5,
44, 45. His <hi>Philanthropie</hi> and Communicative
Love, from his own infinite self-fulness, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
all Creatures in all Places, Times, and
Seasons, are filled and satisfied, as from an
immeasurable Ocean of Goodness, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto us to direct the exercise of that
drop from the <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> wherewith we
are intrusted. <hi>Love your Enemies,</hi> saith our
Saviour, <hi>bless them that curse you, do good to
them that hate you, and pray for them which
despightfully use you and persecute you; that
you may be the Children of your Father which
is in Heaven, who maketh his Sun to rise on the
Evil and the Good, and sendeth rain on the
Just, and on the Vnjust.</hi> Now all Mankind
may be cast into two Ranks or Orders. For
First, there are those who are yet without
Christ, being Aliens from the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of Israel,<note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 12,</note> and strangers from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
of Promise, having no hope, and
without God in the World; such we mean
as are either <hi>Negatively</hi> or <hi>Privatively</hi> Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
or Unbelievers; who have yet never
heard the Sound of the Gospel, or do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to refuse and reject it, where it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
and tendred unto them. And there are
those, Secondly, who have in one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57351:15"/>
received the Doctrine of the Gospel, and
do make profession thereof in the World. To
both these sorts we do acknowledge that we
owe the Duty of Love. Even towards the
<hi>Infidel, Pagan,</hi> and <hi>Mahumetan</hi> world, <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> we are Debtors in this Duty;
and we desire to be humbled for it as our Sin,
wherein we are wanting in the discharge of it,
or wherein the fruits of it do not abound in us
to the Praise of God. Now <hi>Love,</hi> in the first
notion of it, is the willing of a wanted Good
unto the Object of it, or those that are Loved,
producing an endeavour to effect it, unto the
utmost of the Ability of them in whom it is.
Where this absent Good is of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
the first natural and genuine Effect
of Love is <hi>Compassion.</hi> This <hi>Good,</hi> as unto all
<hi>Vnbelievers,</hi> is whatever should deliver them
from present or eternal misery; whatever
should lead, guide, or bring them unto Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness
in the Enjoyment of God. Besides
the <hi>absence</hi> hereof is accompanied even in
this world, with all that Blindness and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mind, all that slavery unto Sin and
the <hi>Devil,</hi> that can any way concur to make
a Rational Being truly miserable. If we have
not <hi>hearts</hi> like the flint or <hi>Adamant,</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be moved with <hi>Compassion</hi> towards so
many perishing Souls, originally made like
our selves in the Image of God, and from
whom that we differ in anything, is an Effect
of meer Soveraign Grace, and not the fruit of
our own Contrivance, nor the Reward of our
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57351:15"/>
worth or merit. And those who are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unconcerned in <hi>others,</hi> are not much
concerned in <hi>themselves;</hi> for the true Love
of our selves, is the Rule of our Love unto
other Men. Again, <hi>Compassion</hi> proceeding
from Love will work by <hi>Prayer</hi> for Relief:
For it is God alone who can supply their
wants; and our only way of treating with
him about it, is by our humble Supplications.
And if herein also we should be found <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi>
we should more judg our selves to be
defective in true Christian Love and Charity,
than we can for many of those mistakes which
are charged on us in other things, were we
convinced that such they are, which as yet
we are not. It is therefore our continual
Prayer, that God would <hi>send out his Light
and his Truth</hi> unto the utmost parts of the
Earth, to visit by them those dark places,
which are yet filled with habitations of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
that he would remove the vail of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which is yet on the Face of many great
and Populous Nations, that the whole Earth
may be filled with the <hi>knowledg of the Lord, as
the waters cover the Sea;</hi> even that according
to his Promise, <hi>he would turn to the People a
pure Language, that they may all call upon the
Name of the Lord, to serve him with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi>
And this we desire to be found doing,
not in a formal or Customary manner, but
out of a sincere <hi>Compassion</hi> for the Souls of
men, a deep sense of the Interest herein of the
Glory of God, and a desire after the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:57351:16"/>
of those Prophecies and Promises
in the Scripture, which speak comfortably
towards an Expectation of abundant Grace
to be manifested unto the residue of Sinners,
both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in the latter dayes.
Moreover, unto Compassion and Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Love requireth that we should add also
all other possible <hi>Endeavours for their Relief.</hi>
Herein consists that work and Labour of Love,
which are so much recommended unto us.
But the <hi>Actings of Love</hi> in these most useful
ways, are for the most part obstructed unto
us, by the want of opportunities, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Guidance of Divine Providence are
the Rule of our Call unto the Duties wherein
such endeavours consist, and whereby they
may be expressed. Only this at present we
have to rejoyce in, that through the unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Labours of some Holy and Worthy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
<hi>Sundry Churches of Indians</hi> are lately
called and gathered in <hi>America,</hi> wherein the
Natives of those parts of the World, who for
so many Generations <hi>sate in Darkness, and
in the shadow of death,</hi> do under the guidance
of Pastors and Elders of their own, walk in
the <hi>Fellowship of the Gospel,</hi> giving Glory to
God by <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> And let it not seem im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
that we have given this Account of
our Judgments concerning that Love which
we do and ought to bear unto <hi>all,</hi> even the
<hi>worst of men;</hi> seeing those by whom our Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
is received, will not, nay, cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
suppose that we would <hi>wilfully neglect</hi> the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57351:16"/>
exercise of the same Affections towards those,
concerning whom our Obligations thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
are unspeakably greater and more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>
            <p>There is indeed another kind of <hi>pretended
charity</hi> towards this sort of men, which we
profess we have not for them, although we
judge we do not want it. For there can be no
want unto any of an <hi>Errour</hi> or mistake,
wherein the charity intended doth consist.
And this is the judgment of some, that they
or <hi>some of</hi> them may attain salvation or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
blessedness in the condition wherein they
are, <hi>without the knowledge</hi> of Jesus Christ.
This we acknowledge we neither believe, nor
hope concerning them; nor, to speak plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
can <hi>desire it should be so,</hi> unless God had
otherwise revealed himself concerning <hi>Jesus
Christ</hi> and them, than yet he hath done. And
we are so far from supposing that there is in
us on this account any <hi>blameable defect of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
that we know our selves to be freed by
this perswasion from a dangerous errour,
which if admitted, would both weaken our
own faith, and impair all the due and proper
effects of charity towards others.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 5, 6.</note> For <hi>though
there be that are called gods, whether in Heaven
or in earth (as there be gods many, and lords
many) yet unto us there is but one God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
of whom are all things, and we in him;
and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all
things, and we by him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 12.</note> We know there is no
salvation in any other but by <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57351:17"/>
               <hi>that there is no other name under heaven given
among men whereby we must be saved.</hi> Nor is
this Name given any otherwise amongst men,
but by the Gospel: For it is not the giving
of the person of Christ absolutely to be a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,</hi>
but the declaration of his <hi>Name</hi> by
the Gospel, as the means of salvation, that is
intended. Hence our Lord Jesus Christ, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that Commission to his Apostles to preach
it, <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
to every Creature,</hi> he adds unto it that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory
sentence, concerning the everlasting
condition of all men with respect thereunto;
<hi>He that believeth and is baptized,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 16. 15. 16.</note> 
               <hi>shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
and he that believeth not, shall be damned.</hi>
As the <hi>Preaching of the Gospel,</hi> and the belief
on Jesus Christ thereon, are the only means
of obtaining salvation; so all those who are
not made partakers of them must perish eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.
So when the Apostle affirms that the
<hi>Jewes</hi> would have hindred them <hi>from preaching
to the Gentiles that they might be saved,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thess. 2. 16.</note> he
plainly declares that without it they could
not so be. Neither were any of them ever bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or in a better condition, than they are
described by the same Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 12.
And in sundry other places, wherein he allows
them no possibility of obtaining eternal bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness.
Neither do we in this matter consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what <hi>God can do,</hi> or what he hath done to
the communicating of grace and faith in Jesus
Christ unto any <hi>particular persons</hi> at any time,
or in any place, in an extraordinary manner.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:57351:17"/>
We are not called to make a judgment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
nor can any Rule be hence collected to
regulate the exercise of our love. <hi>Secret things
belong to the Lord our God, but revealed things
to us and our children, that we may do his will.</hi>
When and <hi>where</hi> such grace and faith do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
themselves by their effects, we ought
readily to own and embrace them. But the
only <hi>inquiry</hi> in this matter is, What those that
are utterly destitute of the Revelation of Jesus
Christ, either as made <hi>originally</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
or as <hi>explained</hi> in the Gospel, may under
the meer conduct of the Light of Nature, as
consisting in the innate principles of Reason,
with their improvement, or as increased by
the consideration of the effects of <hi>divine power</hi>
and Providence, by the strength and exercise
of their own moral principles attain unto, as
unto their present acceptance with God, and
future eternal salvation. That they may be <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in every Sect, who live exactly according to
the Light of Nature,</hi> is a Doctrine anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
by the Church of <hi>England, Artic.</hi> 8.
And the Reason given hereof is, because the
<hi>Scriptures propose the Name of Jesus Christ alone
whereby we may be saved.</hi> And if we do believe
that description which is given in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of men, their <hi>moral abilities,</hi> and their
works, as they lye in the common state of
Mankind, since the entrance of sin, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
unto God and salvation, we shall not be
able to be of another mind: For they are said
to be <hi>blind,</hi>

unto them;<note place="margin">Eph. 2. 1, 2, 3.</note> and their minds to be <hi>enmity against
God himself.</hi> That there may be any just ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
concerning such <hi>persons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 4. 18.</note> that they
will work out <hi>their salvation with fear and
trembling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 8.</note> we are not convinced: Neither do
we think that God will accept of a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
obedience in them that know not <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> than he requires of them who do
believe in him, for then should he prove a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
unto them. Beside, all their best
works are severely reflected on in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and represented as unprofitable: For
whereas in themselves they are compared to
<hi>evil Trees, Thorns,</hi> and <hi>Briars,</hi> we are assured
they neither do, nor can bring forth <hi>good
grapes or Figgs.</hi> Besides in the Scripture, the
whole business of salvation in the first place
turns upon the Hinge of Faith supernatural
and divine;<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 6.</note> 
               <hi>for without faith it is impossible to
please Gid;</hi> and, <hi>He that believeth not, shall be
damned;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3. 15 36.</note> 
               <hi>He that believeth not in the name of
the Son of God is condemned already;</hi> for <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Circumcision availeth any thing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> 
               <hi>nor uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
but faith that worketh by love:</hi> And
it is by faith <hi>that the just shall live.</hi> That this
Faith may be educed out of the obediential
Principle of Nature, 'twas indeed the opinion
of <hi>Pelagius</hi> of old; but 'twill not now, we
hope, be openly asserted by any. Moreover,
this Faith is in the Scripture, if not limited
and determined, yet directed unto Jesus Christ
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57351:18"/>
as its necessary peculiar Object: <hi>For this is
Life eternal, that we may know the only true
God, and Jesus Christ whom he hath sent.</hi> It
seems therefore that the knowledge of the
<hi>only true God,</hi> is not sufficient to attain <hi>eternal
life,</hi> unless the knowledge of Jesus Christ also
do accompany it: For <hi>this is</hi> the record of
Heaven, that <hi>God hath given unto us eternal
Life, and this life is in his Son:</hi> He <hi>that hath
the Son hath life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 5. 11, 12.</note> 
               <hi>and he that hath not the Son
of God hath not life.</hi> Which is enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the controversie. And those Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that there <hi>is no other Name given amongst
men, whereby they may be saved;</hi> and <hi>that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
foundation can no man lay, save what is
laid, that is,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 4. 12</note> 
               <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> are of the same im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 11.</note>
and it were needless to multiply
the Testimonies that are given us to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
elsewhere. Neither can it be made to
appear, that the concatenation of the saving
means, whereby men that are <hi>adult</hi> are
brought unto glory, is not absolutely univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal:
And amongst them there is <hi>Vocation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 29, 30.</note> or
an effectual Calling to the knowledg of Christ
by the Gospel. Neither will the same Apostle
allow a saving invocation of the Name of God
to any but those that are brought to believe
by <hi>hearing the Word preached.</hi> It is said, that
God may by wayes secret and unknown to us,<note place="margin">Rom. 10. 13, 14, 15</note>
reveal Jesus Christ to them, and so by faith in
him sanctifie their natures, and endow them
with his Spirit; which things, it is granted,
we suppose, are indispensibly necessary unto
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57351:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
salvation. Those whom God thus deals with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
are not <hi>Pagans,</hi> but Christians, concerning
whom none ever doubted, but they might be
sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed. It is also granted, that men may learn
much of the power, wisdome and goodness
of God, which both require and teach many
<hi>Duties</hi> to be performed towards him; but
withall we believe, that without <hi>the internal
sanctification of the Spirit,</hi> communicated by
and with the knowledg of Jesus Christ, no man
can be saved. But we intend not here to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
about these things. Instead of an effect
of Love and Charity, it is manifest that the
Opinion which grants <hi>salvation unto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi>
or any of them, upon the due improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Rational Faculties and moral
Principles, ariseth from a want of due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the true nature of Sin and Grace,
of the Fall of Man and his Recovery, of the
Law and Gospel, and of the Wisdome and
Love of God in sending Jesus Christ to make
attonement for sinners, and to bring in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Righteousness. And not only so, but
it evidently Prepares the way unto those <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious
Opinions</hi> which at this day among many
infest and corrupt Christian Religion, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
those Seeds of <hi>Atheism</hi> which spring up
so fast as to threaten the overspreading of the
whole Field of Christianity. For hence it will
follow by an easie deduction, that every <hi>one
may be saved,</hi> or attain unto his utmost happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in his own Religion, be it what it will,
whilst under any notion or conception he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57351:19"/>
a Divine Being, and his own
dependance thereon. And seeing that on this
supposition it must be confessed, that Religion
consists solely in <hi>moral Honesty,</hi> and a fancied
<hi>internal Piety</hi> of mind towards the Deity,
(for in nothing else can a centring of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions
in the world unto a certain end be
imagined) it follows, that there is <hi>no outward
Profession of it</hi> indispensibly necessary, but
that every one may take up, and make use of
that which is best suited unto his interest in his
present condition and circumstances. And as
this being once admitted, will give the minds of
men an <hi>Indifferency,</hi> as unto the several Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are in the world, so it will quickly
produce in them a <hi>Contempt</hi> of them all. And
from an entertainment of, or an indifferency
of mind about these and the like <hi>noysome opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>
it is come to pass, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
after a continued Triumph for <hi>sixteen
hundred years</hi> over Hell and the world, doth
at this day in the midst of <hi>Christendome</hi> hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with multitudes maintain the reputation of
its truth and Divinity; and is by <hi>many,</hi> living
in a kind of outward conformity unto the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
of Christian Religion, despised &amp; laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to scorn. But the proud and foolish <hi>Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Opiniators</hi> of our dayes, whose sole design is
to fortifie themselves by the darkness of their
minds, against the charges of their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
upon their wicked and debauched
conversations, do but expose themselves to
the scorn of all sober and rational Persons.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57351:20"/>
For what are a <hi>few obscure,</hi> and for the most
part <hi>vitious Renegadoes,</hi> in comparison of those
great, wise, numerous and sober persons,
whom the Gospel in its first setting forth in
the world, by the <hi>evidence</hi> of its <hi>truth,</hi> and
the <hi>efficacy</hi> of its <hi>Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> subdued and conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?
Are they as learned as the renowned
<hi>Philosophers</hi> of those dayes, who advantaged
by the endeavours and fruits of all the great
Wits of <hi>former Ages</hi> had advanced solid ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Literature to the <hi>greatest height</hi> that ever
it attained in this world; or possibly ever
will do so; the minds of men having now som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more excellent and noble to entertain
themselves-withall? Are they to be equalled
in <hi>wisdome</hi> and <hi>experience,</hi> with those glorious
Emperors, <hi>Senators</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> who then
swayed the Scepters and affairs of the world?
Can they produce any thing to <hi>oppose unto the
Gospel,</hi> that is likely to influence the minds of
men, in any degree comparably to the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these great, learned, wise and mighty
Personages, which having received by their
Fathers, from dayes immemorial, was visibly
attended with all <hi>Earthly Gloryes</hi> and <hi>Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities,</hi>
which were accounted as the reward of
their due observance of it? And yet whereas
there was a <hi>Conspiracy</hi> of all those persons, and
this influenced by the craft of <hi>infernal Powers,</hi>
and managed with all that wisdome, subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
power and cruelty, that the nature of man
is capable to exercise, on purpose to oppose
the Gospel, and keep it from taking Root in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57351:20"/>
the world; yet by the glorious <hi>evidence of its
divine extract</hi> and original wherewith it is
accompanied, by the efficacy and power which
God gave the Doctrine of it in and over the
minds of men, all mannaged by the spiritual
weapons of its Preachers, <hi>which were mighty

nothing more contemptible, than that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence

their lusts and vices, who are void of all <hi>those
excellencies</hi> in notion and practise, which have
already been triumphed over by the Gospel,
when set up in competition with it, or opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

it into question, or to cast any disreputation
upon it. But to treat of these things is not
our present design; we have only mentioned
them <hi>occasionally,</hi> in the account which it was

our <hi>Love</hi> ought to be intense and fervent, as
that which is the immediate Bond of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57351:21"/>
unto them, and Union with them. And
this Kingdome or Church of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the
earth, may be, and is generally by all consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
under a threefold notion. (1.) First,
as therein, and among the Members of it, is
comprized that <hi>real living and spiritual body
of his,</hi> which is firstly, peculiarly, and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> militant in this world.
These are his Elect, Redeemed, justified, and
sanctified ones, who are savingly united unto
their Head, by the same quickning and sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
Spirit, dwelling <hi>in him in all fulness,</hi> and
communicated <hi>unto them by him,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cording to
his Promise. This is that <hi>Catholick Church</hi>
which we profess to believe, which being hid
from the eyes of men, and absolutely invisible
in its <hi>Mystical Form,</hi> or spiritual saving Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto the Lord Christ, and its Unity with
him, is yet more or less alwayes visible, by
that <hi>Profession of Faith</hi> in him, and obedience
unto him, which it maketh in the world, and
is alwayes obliged so to do. For <hi>With the
Heart man believeth unto Righteousness,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 10, 10.</note> 
               <hi>and
with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.</hi>
And this Church we believe to be so disposed
over the whole world, that where-ever there
are any <hi>Societies</hi> or <hi>Numbers of men</hi> who or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
profess the Gospel, and subjection
to the Kingly Rule of Christ thereby, with an
hope of eternal blessedness by his Mediation;
we no way doubt but that there are among
them <hi>some</hi> who really belong thereunto. In
and by them doth the Lord Christ continually
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57351:22"/>
fulfil and accomplish the <hi>Promise of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi>
by his Spirit with them that believe in
his name; who are thereby Interested in all
the Priviledges of the Gospel, and <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>
unto the Administration and Participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the Holy Ordinances thereof. And
were it not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we ought not to <hi>boast our
selves against others,</hi> Especially such as have
not had the Spiritual Advantages that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
of these Nations have been intrusted
withal, and who have been exposed unto
<hi>more violent Temptations</hi> than they, we should
not fear to say, that among those of all sorts
who in these Nations hold the Head, there is
probably according unto a Judgment to be
made by the fruits of that Spirit which is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
communicated unto the Church in this
sense alone, a greater number of Persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
thereunto, than in any <hi>One Nation
or Church</hi> under Heaven. The charge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of some against us, that we <hi>Paganize the
Nation,</hi> by reason of some different Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
from others, concerning the regular
Constitution of <hi>particular Churches</hi> for the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration
of Gospel Worship, is wondrous
vain and ungrounded. But we know that
men use such severe Expressions and Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
out of a <hi>discomposed habit of Mind</hi> which
they have accustomed themselves unto, and
not from a sedate Judgment and considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the things themselves. And hence they
will labour to <hi>convince others</hi> of that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
if they would put it unto a serious Tryal,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57351:22"/>
they would never be able to convince them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
            <p>This then is that Church which on the
account of their <hi>Sincere faith and Obedience</hi>
shall be saved; and out of which, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their <hi>Profession,</hi> there is no salvation
to be obtained; which things are weakly and
arrogantly appropriated unto any <hi>Particular
Church</hi> or Churches in the World. For it is
possible that men may be Members of it, and
yet not belong or relate unto any particular
Church on the Earth; and so it often fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
out as we could manifest by instances, did
that work now lie before us. This is the
Church which the <hi>Lord Christ loved and
gave himself for it;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>that he might sanctifie and
cleanse it with the washing of water by the
Word; that he might present it unto himself a
Glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle or
any such thing, but that it should be holy and
without blemish.</hi> And we must acknowledge
that in all things <hi>this is the Church,</hi> unto
which we have our first and Principal regard,
as being the spring from which all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
of the Church do flow. Within
the virge and compass of it, do we indeavour
to be found, the End of the Dispensation of
the Gospel unto Men being that they should
do so. Neither would we to save our Lives,
(<hi>which for the Members of this Church</hi> and their
good,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3, 16.</note> we are bound to lay down, when
justly called thereunto) wilfully live in the
neglect of that Love towards them or any of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57351:23"/>
them, which we hope God hath planted in
our hearts, and made natural unto us, by
that <hi>one and self-same Spirit,</hi> by whom the
whole Mystical Body of Christ is animated.
We do confess, that because the best of Men
in this Life do <hi>know but in part,</hi> that all the
Members of this Church are in many things
liable to Error, mistakes, and Miscarriages:
And hence it is, that although they are all
<hi>internally acted and guided by the same Spirit,</hi>
in all things absolutely necessary to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
salvation, and do all attend unto the
same <hi>Rule of the Word,</hi> according as they
apprehend the mind of God in it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
it, have all for the Nature and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of it, the <hi>same Divine Faith</hi> and Love,
and are all equally <hi>united</hi> unto their Head;
yet in the Profession which they make of the
conceptions and perswasions of their minds,
about the things revealed in the Scripture,
there are, and always have been many Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
among them. Neither is it <hi>morally
possible</hi> it should be otherwise, whilst in their
Judgment and Profession they are left unto
the Ability of their own Minds, and Liberty
of their Wills, under that great variety of
the Means of Light and Truth, with other
Circumstances, whereinto they are disposed
by the Holy Wise Providence of God. Nor
hath the Lord Christ <hi>absolutely</hi> Promised that
it shall be otherwise with them; but secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them all by his Spirit in the <hi>foundations
of eternal Salvation,</hi> he leaves them in other
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57351:23"/>
things to the exercise of mutual Love and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance;
with a charge of Duty after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
endeavour to grow up unto a perfect
Union, by the improvement of the blessed
Aids and Assistances which he is pleased to
afford unto them. And those who by <hi>ways
of Force</hi> would drive them into any other
Union or Agreement, than their own Light
and Duty will lead them into, do what in
them lies to oppose the whole Design of the
Lord Christ towards them, and his Rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them. In the mean time it is granted,
that they may fall into Divisions and <hi>Schisms,</hi>
and mutual Exasperations among themselves,
through the Remainders of Darkness in their
minds, and the Infirmity of the flesh.<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 3.</note> And
in such Cases <hi>mutual judgings</hi> and despisings
are apt to ensue; and that to the Prejudice
and great Disadvantages of that <hi>Common faith</hi>
which they do profess. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all this (such cross intangled wheels
are there in the course of our Nature) they
all of them really value and esteem the <hi>things
wherein they agree</hi> incomparably above those
wherein they differ. But their valuation of
the <hi>matter</hi> of their Union and Agreement is
purely <hi>spiritual;</hi> whereas their Differences
are usually influenced by <hi>Carnal</hi> and
Secular Considerations, which have for
the most part a sensible Impression on the
Minds of poor Mortals. But so far as their
Divisions and Differences are unto them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable,
the <hi>Remedy</hi> of farther Evils pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57351:24"/>
from them, is plainly and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expressed in the Scripture. It is <hi>Love,
Meckness,</hi> forbearance, bowels of Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with those other Graces of the Spirit,
wherein our Conformity unto Christ doth
consist, with a true understanding and due
valuation of the <hi>Vnity of faith,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Hope of Believers, which are the ways
prescribed unto us, for the prevention of those
Evils which, without them, our unavoidable
Differences will occasion. And this <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
way</hi> of the Gospel, together with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of <hi>evil surmises,</hi> and a watchfulness
over our selves against <hi>irregular judging</hi> and
censuring of others, together with a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
walking in consent and Unity so far as
we have attained, is so fully and clearly
proposed unto us therein, that they must have
their <hi>Eyes blinded</hi> by Prejudices and Carnal
Interests, or some effectual working <hi>of the
God of this world on their minds,</hi> into whose
understandings the Light of it doth not shine
with uncontroulable Evidence and Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
That the <hi>Sons or Children of this</hi> Church
of <hi>Jerusalem which is above, and is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of us all,</hi> should on the account of their
various Apprehensions of some things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to Religion or the worship of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably
attending their frail and imperfect
condition in this world, yea or of any <hi>Schisms</hi>
or Divisions ensuing thereon; proceeding
from Corrupt and not throughly mortified
Affections, be warranted to hate, judge, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57351:24"/>
or contemn one another, much more to
strive by <hi>external force</hi> to coerce, punish or
destroy them that differ from them, is as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
to the Gospel, as that we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and not in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
Whatever share therefore we are <hi>forced</hi> to
bare in Differences with, or Divisions from
the Members of this Church, (that is, any who
declare and evidence themselves so to be, by
a <hi>visible and regular Profession of faith and
Obedience</hi>) as it is a continual sorrow and
trouble unto us; so we acknowledge it to
be our Duty (and shall be willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
any blame, where we are found defective
in the Discharge of it, unto the utmost of our
Power) to endeavour after the <hi>strictest Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
with them in all Spiritual things, that
the Gospel doth require, or whereof our
condition in this world is capable. In the
mean time, until this can be attained, it is our
desire to mannage the <hi>Profession of our own
Light</hi> and Apprehensions, without Anger,
Bitterness, Clamours, Evil speaking, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other thing that may be irregular in our
selves, or give just cause of <hi>offence</hi> unto others.
Our Prayers are also continually for the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Prosperity of this Church, for its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
in <hi>Faith and Holiness,</hi> and especially
for the healing of all breaches that are among
them that belong thereunto throughout the
World. And were we not satisfied that the
<hi>Principles</hi> which we own, about the right
<hi>Constitution of the Churches of Christ,</hi> and the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57351:25"/>
               <hi>Worship of God</hi> to be observed in them, are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
suited to the furtherance and Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of <hi>Vnion</hi> and due Order among all the
members of this Church, we should not need to
be excited by any unto their Renunciation.
But our main design in all these things is,
that both they, and we with them, may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
that peace which the Lord Christ hath <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed</hi>
unto us, and walk in the way which
he hath prescribed for us. And these things
we mention, neither to <hi>boast</hi> of, nor yet to
<hi>justifie</hi> our selves, but only to acknowledge
what is our conviction concerning our Duty
in this matter. And might there any sedate,
peaceable, <hi>unprejudicate endeavours</hi> be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
and encouraged, for the allaying of
all occasional distempers, and the composing
of all differences among them who belong to
this Church of Christ, so as that they might
all of them (at least in these Nations) not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>keep the unity of the Spirit in the Bond of
Peace,</hi> but also agree and consent in all wayes
and Acts of <hi>Religious Communion;</hi> we doubt
not but to manifest, that no rigid adherence
unto the practise of any conceptions of our
own, in things wherein the Gospel alloweth a
<hi>condescention</hi> and forbearance, no delight in
singularity, no prejudice against persons or
things, should obstruct us in the promotion
of it to the utmost of our power and ability.
Upon the whole matter we own it as our duty
to <hi>follow and seek after peace, unity, consent
and agreement in holy worship,</hi> with all the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57351:25"/>
members of this Church, or those who by a
regular profession manifest themselves so to
be; and will with all readiness and alacrity
<hi>renounce</hi> every principle or practise, that is
either inconsistent with such communion, or
directly or indirectly is in its self obstructive
of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Church of Christ may be
considered with respect unto its <hi>outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,</hi>
as constitutive of its <hi>Being,</hi> and the
formal Reason of its denomination. And
this is <hi>the Church Catholick visible,</hi> whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
they all universally belong, who profess
the invocation of the Name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, their Lord and ours, under the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
that shall be mentioned afterwards.
And this is the <hi>visible Kingdome of Christ,</hi>
which on the account of its profession, and
thereby, is distinguished from that <hi>world which
lyeth in evil,</hi> and is absolutely under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Satan: And so in common use, the <hi>Church</hi>
and the <hi>world</hi> are contradistinguished. Yet on
other accounts many who belong unto this
Church, by reason of <hi>some kind of profession</hi>
that they make, may justly be esteemed to be
the <hi>world,</hi> or of it. So our Lord Jesus Christ
called the generality of the <hi>professing Church</hi>
in his time:<note place="margin">John. 15. 18, 19, 25.</note> 
               <hi>The world,</hi> saith he, <hi>hateth me;</hi>
And that we may know that he thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the Church of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> besides that
the circumstances of the place evince it, he
puts it out of question by the Testimony
which he produceth in the confirmation of his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57351:26"/>
Assertion concerning their unjust and causless
hatred; namely, <hi>It is written in their Law,
they have hated me without a cause;</hi> which
being taken out of the <hi>Psalms,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 35. 19</note> was part of the
Law, or Rule of the <hi>Judaical Church</hi> only.
Now he thus terms them, because the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of them, especially their <hi>Rulers,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they professed to know God, and to
worship him according to his Word, and the
Tradition of their Fathers, yet were not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
corrupt and wicked in their Lives, but
also <hi>persecuted</hi> him and his Disciples, in whom
the Power and Truth of God were manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
beyond what they were able to bear. And
hence a General Rule is established, that what
<hi>Profession</hi> soever any men do make of the
Knowledge and Worship of God, to what
<hi>Church</hi> soever they do, or may be thought
to belong, yet if they are wicked or ungodly
in their Lives, and Persecuters of such as are
better than themselves, they are really of
the <hi>World,,</hi> and with it will perish, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Repentance. These are they, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
on them a <hi>Form</hi> or Delineation <hi>of
Godliness,</hi> do yet <hi>deny the Power</hi> of it;
from whom, we are commanded to <hi>turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:</hi>
But yet we acknowledge that there is
a real difference to be made between them,
who in any way or manner make <hi>profession</hi>
of the Name of Christ with subjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and that <hi>Infidel world,</hi> by whom
the Gospel is totally rejected, or to whom
it was never tendred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:57351:26"/>
In the <hi>Catholick visible Church,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
of all who throughout the
world outwardly own the Gospel, there is
an acknowledgment of <hi>one Lord, one Faith,
one Baptism,</hi> which are a sufficient Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Love, Union and Communion
among them, which they are capable of, or
are required of them. For in the <hi>joynt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
of the same Lord, Faith and Baptism,
consists the Union of the Church, under this
consideration, that is, as <hi>Catholick and visibly
professing,</hi> and in nothing else. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
also is required as the principle anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that Communion, and rendring it accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
<hi>mutual Love</hi> with its occasional Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise;
as a fruit of that Love which we have
unto Jesus Christ, who is the Object of
our Common Profession. And setting aside
the consideration of them who openly reject
the <hi>Principal Fundamentals of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
(as denying the Lord Christ to be the
Eternal Son of God, with the use and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of his death, as also the Personal subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
and Deity of the Holy Spirit,) and
there is no known Community of these Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
in the world, but they own so much
of the Truths, concerning <hi>one Lord, one Faith,
and one baptism,</hi> as are sufficient to guide them
unto Life and Salvation. And hereon we no
way doubt, but that among them all there
are some really belonging to the <hi>Purpose of
Gods Election,</hi> who by the means that they
do enjoy, shall at length be brought unto
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57351:27"/>
everlasting Glory. For we do not think
that God by his Providence would maintain
the <hi>Dispensation of the Gospel</hi> in any Place,
or among any People, among whom there
are none whom he hath designed to bring unto
the Enjoyment of Himself. For that is the
Rule of his sending and continuing of it;<note place="margin">Acts. 18. 9, 10, 11.</note>
whereon he enjoyned the <hi>Apostle Paul</hi> to stay
in such places where he <hi>had much People</hi> whom
he would have to be converted. He would
not continue from Generation to Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to scatter his <hi>Pearls</hi> where there were
none but <hi>rending Swine,</hi> nor send <hi>Fishers</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
waters wherein he knew there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but <hi>Serpents</hi> and <hi>Vipers.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 14.</note> It is true, the
Gospel as preached unto many is only a <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony</hi>
against them,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 16.</note> leaving them without
excuse; and proves unto them <hi>a Savour of
Death unto Death.</hi> But the first, direct, and
principal Design of the Dispensation of it,
being the Conversion of Souls, and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
salvation, it will not probably be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in any Place, nor is so, where this
<hi>Design</hi> is not pursued nor accomplished to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
any. Neither will God make use of
it any where meerly for the Aggravation of
Mens Sins and Condemnation; nor would his
so doing consist with the Honour of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
its self, or the Glory of that Love and
Grace which it professeth to declare. Where
it is indeed openly rejected, there that shall
be the <hi>Condemnation of Men;</hi> but where it
finds any admittance, there is hath somewhat
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57351:27"/>
of its genuine and proper work to effect.
And the Gospel is esteemed to be in all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
dispensed and <hi>admitted,</hi> where the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
being received as the word of God, Men
are from the Light, Truth, and Doctrine
contained therein, by any means so far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
as to take upon them the profession
of subjecting their Souls to Jesus Christ, and
of observing the Religious Duties by him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
in opposition to all false Religions
in the World. Amongst all these the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of saving Faith</hi> are at this day preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
For they universally receive the whole
<hi>Canonical Scripture,</hi> and acknowledge it to
be the word of God, on such motives as
prevail with them to do so sincerely. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they give a tacit consent unto the whole
Truth contained in it; for they receive it as
from God without exception or limitation.
And this they cannot do without a <hi>General
Renunciation</hi> of all the falsities and Evils that
it doth condemn. Where these things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,
men will not believe nor practise any thing
in Religion, but what they think <hi>God requires
of them,</hi> and will accept from them. And
we find it also in the Event, that all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
spoken of, where-ever they are, do uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally
profess, that they believe in the <hi>God
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> and in
his only and Eternal Son. They all look al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
for Salvation by him, and profess obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
unto him, believing that God raised him
from the Dead. They believe in like manner
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57351:28"/>
that the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is the Spirit of the Father
and the Son, with many other sacred Truths
of the same importance; as also, that <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Holiness no Man shall see God.</hi> However
therefore they are differenced and divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves, however they are mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
esteemed <hi>Hereticks</hi> and <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
through the Subtlety of Satan they are
excited and provoked to <hi>Curse</hi> and <hi>Persecute</hi>
one another, with wonderful Folly, and by
an open contradiction unto other Principles
which they profess; yet are they all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the Visible Kingdom of Christ, and
belong all of them to the <hi>Catholik Church,</hi>
making profession of the name of Christ in
the World, in which there is Salvation to be
obtained, and out of which there is none.</p>
            <p>We take not any consideration at present
of that absurd foolish and <hi>uncharitable Error,</hi>
which would confine the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> of
Christ unto a particular Church of one single
Denomination; or indeed rather unto a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
of some Persons, in an outward mode
of Religious Rule and Worship; where of the
Scripture is as silent, as of things that never
were, nor ever shall be. Yea we look upon
it as intollerable Presumption, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
height of <hi>Vncharitableness,</hi> for any to
judge, that the constant Profession of the name
of Christ, made by Multitudes of Christians,
with the lasting miseries and frequent <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdomes</hi>
which for his sake they undergo,
should turn unto no advantage either of the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57351:28"/>
Glory of God, or their own Eternal Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness,
because in some things they differ
from them. Yet such is the Judgment of
those of the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> and so are they
bound to judge by the fundamental Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Laws of their Church Communion.
But men ought to fear least they should <hi>meet
with Judgment without Mercy, who have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no Mercy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 2. 13.</note> Had we ever entertained a
thought uncharitable to such a Prodigie of
insolence, had we ever excluded any sort of
<hi>Christians</hi> absolutely from an interest in the
Love of God or Grace of Jesus Christ, or
hopes of Salvation, because they do not, or
will not comply with those ways and terms
of <hi>outward Church Communion</hi> which we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of, we should judg our selves as high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
criminal in want of Christian Love, as any
can desire to have us esteemed so to be.</p>
            <p>It is then the universal <hi>Collective Body</hi> of
them that profess the Gospel throughout the
world which we own as the Catholick Church
of Christ. How far the <hi>Errors</hi> in Judgment,
or miscarriages in sacred worship, which any
of them have superadded unto the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Truth which they do profess, may be
of so pernicious a nature as to hinder them
from an Interest in the Covenant of God, and
so prejudice their Eternal Salvation, God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knows. But those <hi>Notices</hi> which we have
concerning the Nature and will of God in the
Scripture, as also of the Love, Care and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
of Jesus Christ, with the Ends of his
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57351:29"/>
               <hi>Mediation,</hi> do perswade us to believe, that
where Men in sincerity do improve the Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and Means of the Knowledg of Divine
Truth where with they are intrusted, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
withall to answer their Light and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
with a suitable <hi>Obedience,</hi> there are
but few Errors of the Mind, of so malignant
a nature, as absolutely to exclude such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
from an Interest in Eternal Mercy. And
we doubt not, but that men out of a <hi>Zeal</hi> to
the Glory of God, real or pretended, have
imprisoned, banished, killed, burned others
for such <hi>Errors,</hi> as it hath been the Glory of
God to pardon in them, and which he hath
done accordingly. But this we must grant,
and do, that those whose <hi>Lives and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations</hi>
are no way influenced by the Power of
the Gospel, so as to be brought to some Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
thereunto; or who under the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
of a Christian Profession, do give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
up unto <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Persecution</hi> of the
true Worshipers of God; are no otherwise to
be esteemed but as Enemies to the Cross of
Christ.<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 14.</note> For as without <hi>Holiness no Man
shall see God,</hi> so no <hi>Idolater,</hi> or <hi>Murderer,
hath eternal Life abiding in him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 21. 8.</note>
            </p>
            <p>With respect unto these things we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 15.</note> or the Generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Nation professing Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
(measuring them by the Doctrine that
hath been preached unto them, and received
by them, since the Reformation,) to be as
sound and healthful a part of the Catholick
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57351:29"/>
Church as any in the world. For we know
no Place, nor Nation, where the <hi>Gospel</hi> for
so long a season hath been <hi>preached</hi> with more
Diligence, Power, and Evidence for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction;
nor where it hath obtained a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Success or Acceptation. Those there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
who <hi>perish amongst us,</hi> do not do so, for
want of Truth, and a right belief, or Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
in Sacred worship, but for their
own Personal Infidelity and Disobedience.
For according to the Rules before laid down,
we do not judge that there are any such <hi>Errors</hi>
publickly admitted among them, nor any
such Miscarriages in Sacred Administration,
as should directly or absolutely hinder their
eternal Salvation. That they be not any of
them, through the Ignorance or Negligence
of those who take upon them the conduct of
their Souls, encouraged in a <hi>State</hi> or <hi>way of
Sin,</hi> or deprived of due Advantages to farther
their spiritual Good, or are lead into Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in Religion neither acceptable unto God,
nor tending to their own Edification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they may be betrayed into Eternal Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
is greatly incumbent on themselves to
consider.</p>
            <p>Unto this <hi>Catholick Church</hi> we owe all
Christian <hi>Love,</hi> and are obliged to exercise
all the Effects of it, both towards the whole,
and every Particular Member, as we have
Advantage and Occasion. And not only so,
but it is our Duty to live in constant <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
with it. This we can no otherwise
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57351:30"/>
do, but by a Profession of <hi>that Faith,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it becomes the Church of Christ in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
under Consideration. For any <hi>failure
herein,</hi> we are not that we know of charged
by any Persons of Modesty or Sobriety. The
Reflections that have been made of late by
some on the <hi>Doctrines we teach or own,</hi> do
fall as severely on the Generality of the
<hi>Church of England,</hi> (at least until within a few
years last past) as they do on us. And we
shall not need to owne any <hi>especial Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in them, until they are publickly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced
by others. Such are the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
concerning Gods <hi>Eternal Decrees, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by Faith,</hi> the <hi>Loss of Original
Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Corruption of Nature,</hi> the
<hi>Nature of Regeneration,</hi> the <hi>Power and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of Grace</hi> in the Conversion of Sinners,
that we say not of the <hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>satisfaction
of Christ.</hi> But we do not think that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
publickly taught and owned among
us, ever since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> will receive
any great dammage by the impotent as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
of some few; especially considering
their mannagement of those assaults, by <hi>tales,
railing,</hi> and <hi>ralliery,</hi> to the lasting reproach
of the Religion which themselves profess, be
it what it will.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Church of Christ, or the <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Professors</hi> of the Gospel in the world, may
be considered as they are disposed of by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
or their own choyce, in <hi>Particular
Churches.</hi> These at present are of many sorts,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57351:30"/>
or are esteemed so to be. For whereas the
Lord Christ hath instituted sundry solemn
Ordinances of Divine Worship to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
joyntly by his Disciples, unto his honour
and their edification, this could not be done
but in such <hi>Societies,</hi> Communities, or As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
of them to that purpose. And as
none of them can be duly performed, but in
and by such <hi>Societies;</hi> so some of them do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
express the Union, Love, and common
Hope that is among them, or do consist in the
means of their preservation. Of this latter
sort are all the wayes whereby the <hi>Power of
Christ</hi> is acted in the Discipline of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
Wherefore we believe that our Lord
Jesus Christ, as the King, Ruler, and Lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of his Church, hath ordained that all his
Disciples, all persons belonging unto his
Church in the former notions of it, should be
<hi>gathered</hi> into distinct Societies, and become
as Flocks of Sheep in several Folds, under the
eye of their Great Shepherd, and the respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Conducts of those employed under him.
And this conjunction of Professors in and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>particular Churches,</hi> for the celebration of
the Ordinances of sacred Worship appointed
by Christ, and the participation of his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for their edification, is not a matter of
<hi>accident,</hi> or meerly under the disposal of
<hi>common Providence;</hi> but is to be an act in
them of choice, and voluntary obedience unto
the commands of Christ. By some <hi>this Duty</hi>
is more expresly attended unto than by others;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:57351:31"/>
and by some it is totally neglected. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
antecedently nor consequentially unto
such their <hi>Conjunction,</hi> do they consider what
is their duty unto the Lord Christ therein,
nor what is most meet for their own edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
They go in these things with <hi>others,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the custome of the Times and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
wherein they live, confounding their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and spiritual Relations. And these we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but judge to <hi>walk irregularly,</hi> through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
mistakes, or prejudices: Neither
will they in their least secular concernments,
behave themselves with so much regardlesness
ot negligence. For however their Lot previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
unto their own choyce, may be cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any place or <hi>Society,</hi> they will make an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-judgment
whether it be to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
according to the Rules of prudence, and
by that judgment either abide in their <hi>first
station,</hi> or otherwise dispose of themselves.
But a Liberty of this nature regulated by the
Gospel, to be exercised in and about the great
concernments of mens souls, is by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed,
and by most neglected. Hence it is
come to pass, that the <hi>Societies of Christians</hi>
are for the most part meer effects of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Distributions by Civil Lawes, aiming
principally at other ends and purposes. It is
not denyed but that <hi>Civil Distributions</hi> of
Professors of the Gospel, may be subservient
unto the ends of Religious Societies and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies:
But when they are made a means
to take off the minds of men from all regard
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57351:31"/>
to the Authority of the Lord Christ, institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and appointing such Societies, they are of
no small disadvantage unto true Church-Communion
and Love.</p>
            <p>The Institution of these Churches, and the
Rules for their disposal and Government
throughout the world, are the same, <hi>stable</hi>
and unalterable. And hence there was in the
first Churches, planted by the Apostles, and
those who next succeeded them in the care of
that work, great <hi>Peace, Vnion and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
For they were all gathered and planted
alike, according unto the Institution of Christ;
all <hi>regulated</hi> and ordered by the same common
Rule. Men had not yet found out those things
which were the <hi>Causes of Differences</hi> in after-Ages,
and which yet continue so to be.
Where there was any difference, it was for
the most part on the account of some noysom
foolish <hi>Phantastical Opinions,</hi> vented by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postors,
in direct opposition to the Scripture,
which the generality of Christians did with
one consent abhor. But on various occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and by sundry degrees, there came to be
great variety in the conceptions of men about
these <hi>Particular Churches</hi> appointed for the
Seat and Subject of all Gospel Ordinances,
and wherein they were authoritatively to be
administred in the Name of Jesus Christ: For
the Church in neither of the <hi>former notions</hi> is
capable of such administrations. Some there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rested in <hi>particular Assemblies,</hi> or such
Societies, who did or might meet together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57351:32"/>
the guidance and inspection of their own
Elders,<note place="margin">Act. 14, 23.</note> Overseers, Guides, or Bishops: And
hereunto they added the occasional meetings
of those <hi>Elders</hi> and others,<note place="margin">Chap. 20. 28.</note> to advise and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
in common about the especial necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of any particular Church,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3.</note> or the general
concernments of more of them,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 2</note> as the matter
might require.<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 1.</note> These in name, and some kind
of resemblance, are continued throughout
the World in <hi>Parochial</hi> Assemblies. Others
suppose a particular Church to be such a one
as is now called <hi>Diocesan;</hi> though that name
in its first use and application to Church Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
was of a larger extent, than what it is
now applyed unto, for it was of old the name
of a <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Church. And herein the sole
Rule, Guidance, and <hi>Authoritative inspection</hi>
of many, perhaps a multitude of particular
Churches, assembling for sacred Worship
and the Administration of Gospel Ordinances
distinctly, is committed unto <hi>one man,</hi> whom
in contradistinction from others they call the
<hi>Bishop.</hi> For the joyning of others with him,
or their subordination unto him in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Jurisdiction, hinders not, but that the
sole <hi>Ecclesiastical Power of the Diocess,</hi> may be
thought to reside in him alone: For those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
do either act in his name, or by power
derived from him, or have no pretence unto
any Authority <hi>meerly Ecclesiastical;</hi> howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in common use, what they exercised
may be so termed. But the nature of such
Churches, with the <hi>Rule and Discipline</hi> exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57351:32"/>
in them and over them, is too well
known to be here insisted on. Some rest not
here; but unto these <hi>Diocesan</hi> adde <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>political</hi>
Churches, which also are esteemed
particular Churches, though it be uncertain
by what warrant, or on what grounds. In
these <hi>one person</hi> hath in some kind of Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance,
a respect unto, and over the <hi>Diocesan
Bishops,</hi> like that which they have over the
Ministers of Particular Assemblies. But these
things being animated and regulated by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Arbitrary Rules and <hi>Canons,</hi> or Civil
Laws of the Nations, the due bounds and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of their power cannot be taken from any
<hi>Nature</hi> or Constitution peculiar unto them.
And therefore are there, where-ever they are
admitted, various <hi>Degrees</hi> in their Elevation.
But how much or little the Gospel is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in these things, is easie for any one to
judge. Neither is it by wise men pretended
to be so, any further, than that as they sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
it hath left such things to be ordered by
humane wisdome, for an expediency unto
some certain ends. One or more of these
<hi>Metropolitical Churches,</hi> have been required
in latter Ages, to constitute a <hi>Church Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi>
Though the truth is, that <hi>Apellation</hi> had
originally another occasion; whereunto the
invention of these <hi>Metropolitical Churches</hi>
was accommodated: For it arose not from
any respect unto Ecclesiastical Order or Rule,
but unto the supream <hi>Political Power,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
the Inhabitants of such a <hi>Nation</hi> as gives
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57351:33"/>
Denomination to the Church, are Civilly
subject. Hence that which was <hi>Provincial</hi> at
the first Erection of this Fabrick, which was
in the <hi>Romish Empire,</hi> whilst the whole was
under the power of one Monarch, became
<hi>National</hi> when the several Provinces were
turned into Kingdomes, with absolute Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
power among themselves, wholly inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
of any other. And he who in his own
Person and Authority, would erect an <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical
Image</hi> of that demolished Empire,
will allow of such <hi>Provincial Churches</hi> as have
a dependance upon himself; but cares not to
hear of such <hi>National Churches,</hi> as in their
first notion include a Soveraign Power unto
all intents and purposes within themselves.
So the <hi>Church of England</hi> became <hi>National</hi> in
the dayes of King <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> which
before was but <hi>Provincial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, the consent of many had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed,
that there should be <hi>Patriarchal Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
comprehending under their Inspection
and Jurisdiction many of these <hi>Metropolitical</hi>
and Provincial Churches. And these also
were looked on as Particular; for from their
first invention there having been <hi>four</hi> or <hi>five</hi>
of them, no one of them could be imagined to
comprize the Catholick Church; although
those who presided in them, according to the
pride and vanity of the declining Ages of the
Church, stiled themselves <hi>Oecumenical</hi> and
<hi>Catholick.</hi> Things being carried thus far, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Fifth and Sixth Century of years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57351:33"/>
Christ, <hi>One</hi> owned as Principal or chief of
this latter sort, set up for a Church denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
<hi>Papal,</hi> from a Title he had appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto himself. For by Artifices innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
he ceased not from endeavouring to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
all those other Churches and their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
unto himself: And by the advantage of
his <hi>Pre-eminence</hi> over the other <hi>Patriarks,</hi> as
theirs over <hi>Metropolitans,</hi> and so downwards,
whereby all Christians were imagined to be
comprized within the Precincts of some of
them, he fell into a claim of a Soveraignty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the whole Body of Christianity, and every
particular member thereunto belonging.
This he could have had no pretence for, but
that he thought them cast into such an <hi>Order,</hi>
as that he might possess them on the same
grounds, on which that Order it self was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
For had not <hi>Diocesan, Metropolitical,</hi>
and <hi>Patriarchal</hi> Churches made way for it,
the thought of a <hi>Church Papal,</hi> comprehensive
of all believers, had never befallen the minds
of mind. For it is known, that the prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Empire which the <hi>Pope</hi> claimed and had
obtained over Christianity, was an emergency
of the contests that fell out among the Leaders
of the greater sorts of Churches, about the
Rights, Titles, and Pre-eminences among
themselves, with some other occasional and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testine
Distempers. Only he had one singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
advantage for the promotion of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
and desire. For whereas this whole <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguation
of Churchts</hi> into all these Storyes, in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57351:34"/>
the top whereof he emerged and lifted up
himself, was nothing but an accommodation
of the Church and its Affairs unto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> or the setting
up of an <hi>Ecclesiastical Image</hi> and Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of its Secular Power and Rule, the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
therein of all subordinate Powers and
Orders in <hi>one Monarch,</hi> inclined the minds of
men to comply with his Design, as very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable.
Hence the principal Plea for that
Power <hi>over the whole Church</hi> which at present
he claims, lyes in this, that the Government
of it ought to be <hi>Monarchial.</hi> And therein
consists a chief part of the mystery of this
whole work; that whereas this Fabrick of
Church Rule was erected in imitation of, and
complyance with the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> that he
could never effect his Soveraignty whilst that
Empire stood in its strength and union, under
the command of one or more Emperours by
consent; yet when that Empire was destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Provinces thereof became parcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
out unto several Nations, who erected
absolute independent Soveraignties among
themselves, he was able by the Reputation he
had before obtained, so to improve all <hi>emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies</hi>
and advantages, as to gather all these
new Kingdomes into one <hi>Religious Empire</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
himself, by their common consent. In
the mean time, by the Original <hi>Divisions of
the Empire,</hi> and the Revolutions that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
afterwards amongst the Nations of the
World, the greatest number of Christians
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57351:34"/>
were wholly inconcerned in this new <hi>Church
Soveraignty</hi> which was erected in the Western
Provinces of that Empire. So was the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of Iniquity consummated; for whereas
the <hi>Pope,</hi> to secure his <hi>new Acquisitions,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to empale the Title and Priviledges
of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, unto those Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
which professed Obedience unto himself,
unto an exclusion of a greater number;
there ensued such a confusion of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
and a <hi>particular Church,</hi> as that both of
them were almost utterly lost.</p>
            <p>Concerning these several sorts of <hi>conceited
particular Churches,</hi> it is evident that some of
them, as to their nature and kind, have no
Institution in, nor warrant from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but were <hi>Prudential Contrivances</hi> of
the men of the Dayes wherein they were first
formed; which they effected by various de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
under the conduct of an Apprehension,
that they tended unto the increase of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and Order among Christians. Whether
really and effectually they have attained <hi>that
end,</hi> the event hath long since manifested.
And it will be one day acknowledged, that
no <hi>Religious Vnion or Order</hi> among Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
will be lasting, and of spiritual use or
advantage unto them, but what is appointed
and designed for them by Jesus Christ. The
truth is, the mutual intestine Differences
and Contests among them who first possessed
the <hi>Rule of such Churches,</hi> about their Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
Pre-eminences, Priviledges, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57351:35"/>
which first apparently let in
Pride, Ambition, Revenge, and Hatred,
into the Minds and Lives of Church-Guides,

            <p>How far any man may be obliged in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
unto <hi>communion</hi> with these Churches
in those things wherein they are such, and
as such behave themselves in all their Rule
and Administrations, may be enquired into
by them who are concerned. What respect
we have unto them, or what <hi>Duty</hi> we may
owe them, as they may in any place be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by the Civil Laws of the Supream
Magistrate, is not of our present considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But whereas in their <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Rise,</hi>
they have no other warrant, but the <hi>Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

out and mannagement of their Inventions;
what ground there is for holding a Religious
communion with them, and wherein such
communion may consist, is not easie to be
declared. For the notion that the Church-communion
of the generality of Christians
and Ministers, consists only in a <hi>quiet subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
unto them, who by any means may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be set over them, and claim a right to
rule them, is fond and impious. In the mean
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57351:35"/>
time, we wholly deny, that the Mistakes or
Disorders of Christians in complying with,
or joyning themselves unto such Churches
as have no warrantable institution, ought to
be any cause of the diminishing of our Love
towards them, or of withdrawing it from
them. For notwithstanding their <hi>Errors</hi> and
Wanderings from the Paths of Truth in this
Matter, they do, or may continue interested
in all that Love which is due from us unto the
Church of Christ, upon the double account
before insisted on: For they may be yet
persons <hi>born of God, united unto Christ,</hi> made
partakers of his Spirit, and so belong to the
<hi>Church Catholick, Mystical,</hi> which is the first
principal Object of all Christian Love and
Charity. The <hi>Errors</hi> wherewith they are
supposed to be overtaken, may befal any
persons under those Qualifications, the
admittance of them, though <hi>culpable,</hi> being
not inconsistent with a state of Grace and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
with God. And they may also by
a due profession of the fundamental Truths
of the Gospel, evince themselves to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Subjects of the visible Kingdom of
Christ in the world, and so belong to the
<hi>Church Catholick v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sibly professing;</hi> under
which notion, the Disciples of Christ are in
the next place commended unto our Love.
And it is the fondest imagination in the world,
that we must of necessity <hi>want Love</hi> towards
all those with whom we cannot join in all
acts of Religious Worship; or that there
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57351:36"/>
need be any <hi>Schisme</hi> between them and us,
on the sole account thereof, taking <hi>Schisme</hi> in
the common received notion of it. If we
bear unkindness towards them in our minds
and hearts, if we desire, or seek their hurt,
if we <hi>persecute</hi> them, or put them to trouble
in the world for their Profession, if we pray
not for them, if we pity them not in all their
Temptations, Errors, or Sufferings, if we
say unto any of them <hi>when naked, be thou
cloathed;</hi> and <hi>when hungry, be thou fed;</hi>
but relieve them not according unto our abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and opportunities; if we have an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
to their Persons, or judge them any
otherwise than as they cast themselves openly
and visibly under the sentence of Natural
Reason, or Scripture-Rule, we may be justly
thought to fail in our Love towards them.
But if our Hearts condemn us not in these
things, it is not the difference that is or may
be, between them and us, about <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Constitutions</hi>
or <hi>Order,</hi> that ought be a cause,
or can be an evidence of any want of Love on
our parts: There will indeed be a <hi>distinct
and separate</hi> practice in the things wherein
the difference lies, which in it self, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
other <hi>avoidable evils,</hi> need not on either
side to be <hi>Schismatical.</hi> If by censures or
any kind of power, such Churches or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
would force us to submit unto, or
comply with such things or ways in Religious
Worship, as are contrary unto our Light,
and which they have no <hi>Authority</hi> from the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57351:36"/>
Lord Christ to impose upon us, the whole
state of the Case is changed, as we shall see
afterwards.</p>
            <p>As for those <hi>Particular Churches,</hi> which
in any part of the world, consist of Persons
assembling together for the worship of God
in Christ, under the Guidance of their own
<hi>Lawful Pastors and Teachers,</hi> we have only
to say, that we are full well assured, that
where-ever <hi>two or three are gathered together
in the name of Christ,</hi> there he is present with
them; and farther than this, there are very
few concerning whom we are called to pass
any other Censure or Judgment. So we hope
it is with them, and so we pray that it may
be. And therefore we esteem it our <hi>Duty</hi> to
hold that Communion with all these Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
when called thereunto, which is required
of any Christians in the like cases and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.
Unless we are convinced that,
with respect unto <hi>such or such Instances,</hi> it is
the Mind of Christ that neither among our
selves, nor in Conjunction with others, nor
for the sake of present Communion with them,
we should observe them in his worship, we
judge our selves under an Obligation to make
use of their Assemblies in all Acts of Religion,
unto our Edification, as occasion shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.
But where the <hi>Authority of Christ</hi>
in the things of sacred worship doth intervene,
all other considerations must be discarded;
and a compliance therewith will secure us
from all irregular Events.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:57351:37"/>
It must be acknowledged that many of
these Churches have wofully <hi>degenerated,</hi> and
that any of them may so do, both from their
Primitive Institution, and also the sole Rule
of their worship. And this they may do,
and have done, in such <hi>various Degrees</hi> and
ways, as necessarily requires a great <hi>variety</hi>
in our Judgments concerning them, and our
Communion with them. The whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world gives us Instances hereof at this
Day; yea, we have it confirmed unto us in
what is recorded concerning sundry Churches
mentioned in the <hi>Scripture</hi> its self. They
were newly planted by the <hi>Apostles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and had Rules given by them, to
attend unto, for their Direction. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
they were obliged in all Emergencies to
enquire after and receive those <hi>Command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and
Directions, which they were inabled infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to give unto them. And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
these great Advantages, we f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd that
sundry of them were suddenly fallen into <hi>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
neglects,</hi> disorders, and miscarriages, both
in Doctrine, Discipline, and worship. Some
of these were reproved and reformed by the
<hi>Great</hi> Apostle,<note place="margin">Rev. 2. 3.</note> in his Epistles written unto
them for that End: And some of them were
rebuked and threatned by the Lord Christ
himself immediately from Heaven. That in
process of Time they have increased in their
<hi>Degeneracy,</hi> waxing worse and worse, their
present state and Condition in the world, or
the Remembrance of them which are now not
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57351:37"/>
at all, with the severe dealings of God with
them in his Holy wise Providence, do suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
manifest. Yea some of them, though
yet continuing under other Forms and shapes,
have by their Superstition, false worship, and
<hi>Express Idolatry,</hi> joyned with wickedness
of Life, and Persecution of the true worshi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of Christ, as also by casting themselves
into a new worldly Constitution, utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
unto what is appointed in the Gospel,
abandoned their Interest in the State and
Rights of Churches of Christ. So are sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<hi>faithful Citties become Harlots;</hi> and where
<hi>Righteousness inhabited, there dwells Pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Murderers.</hi> Such Churches were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of Christ <hi>wholly noble vines,</hi> but are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
<hi>into those that are bitter</hi> and wild.
Whatever our Judgment may be concerning
the Personal condition of the Members of
such <hi>apostatized Churches,</hi> or of any of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
all Communion with them, as they would
be esteemed the Seat of Gospel Ordinances,
and in their pretended Administrations of
them, is unlawful for us; and it is our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensible
Duty to separate from them. For
whatever <hi>Indifferency</hi> many may be growing
into, in matter of outward worship, which
ariseth from ignorance of the Respect that is
between the Grace and Institutions of Christ,
as that, from an Apprehension that all <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Religion</hi> consists in <hi>Moral Honesty</hi> only;
yet we know not any other way whereby
we may approve our selves faithful in our
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57351:38"/>
Profession,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 20.</note> but in the Observance <hi>of all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Christ hath commanded,</hi> and to abstain
from what he condemns. For both our Faith
and Love,<note place="margin">John 15. 10, 14.</note> whatever we pretend, will be
found vain, if we endeavour <hi>not to keep his
Commandments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the state of things in the Church
of <hi>Israel</hi> of old, after the Defection u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>der
<hi>Jeroboam.</hi> It was no more a true Church,
nor <hi>any</hi> Church at all, by vertue of positive
Institution: For they had neither <hi>Priests,</hi>
nor <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> nor any Ordinances of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k
worship, that God approved of. Hence
it was the Duty of all that feared God in the
<hi>Ten Tribes,</hi> not to joyn with the Leaders and
Body of the People in their worship; as also
to observe those Sacred Institutions of the
Law, which were forbidden by them, in the
Order that they should not go up to <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 11.</note>
but attend unto all their <hi>Sacred Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
in the Places where the <hi>Calves</hi> were set up.<note place="margin">Chap. 13.</note>
Accordingly many of the most Zealous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
among them,<note place="margin">1 Kings 12.</note> with the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 13.</note>
and with a great Multitude of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
openly seperated from the Rest, and
joyned themselves unto <hi>Judah</hi> in the worship
of God, continued therein. Others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them secretly in the worst of times pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
themselves from the <hi>Abominations</hi> of
the whole People. In like manner under the
new Testament,<note place="margin">Rev. 18. 4.</note> when some have deserved the
Title of <hi>Babylon,</hi> because of their Idolatry,
false worship and Persecution, we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:57351:38"/>
               <hi>to come out from among them,</hi> in an
open visible professed Seperation, that we be
not Partakers of their Sins, and Plagues.
But this Judgment we are not to make, nor
do make concerning any, but such as among
whom <hi>Idolatry</hi> spreads its self over the Face
of all their Solemn Assemblies, and who joyn
thereunto the <hi>Persecution</hi> of them who desire
to worship God in Spirit and in Truth. The
Constitution of such Churches, as to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
acceptable Assemblies of worshipers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, is lost and dissolved: Neither is
it Lawful for any <hi>Disciple of Christ</hi> to partake
with them in their Sacred Administrations;
For so to do, is plainly to disowne the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of Christ, or to set up that of wicked
and Corrupt men above it.</p>
            <p>Yet all this hinders not but that there may
in such <hi>Apostatical Churches</hi> remain a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the fundamental Truths of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.
And by vertue hereof, as they maintain
the interest of <hi>Christ's visible Kingdome</hi> in the
world; so we no way doubt but that there
may be many amongst them, who by a saving
faith in the Truths they do profess, do really
belong to the <hi>Mistical Church</hi> of Christ.</p>
            <p>An instituted Church therefore may by
the <hi>Crimes</hi> and wickedness of its Rulers, and
the generality of its Members, and their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Administrations in holy things, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
destroy their <hi>Instituted Estate,</hi> and yet not
presently all of them cease to belong unto the
Kingdome of Christ. For we cannot say, that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57351:39"/>
those things which will certainly <hi>annul Church
Administrations,</hi> and render them abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
will absolutely destroy the salvation of
all <hi>individual persons</hi> who partake in them;
and many may secretly preserve themselves
from being defiled with such abominations.
So in the height of the Degeneracy and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy
of the <hi>Israelitish Church,</hi> there were seven
thousand who kept themselves pure from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alish
Idolatry,</hi> of whom none were known to
<hi>Elijah.</hi> And therefore did God still continue
a respect unto them as his people, because of
those <hi>secret ones,</hi> and because the Token of his
Covenant was yet in their flesh; affording
unto them an extraordinary Ministry by his
Prophets, when the ordinary by Priests and
Levites was utterly ceased. This we are to
hope concerning every place where there is
any Profession made of the Name of Christ;
seeing it was the Passion of <hi>Elijah</hi> which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him to oversee so great a <hi>Remnant</hi> as God
had left unto himself in the Kingdome of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
And from his example we may learn,
that good men may somtimes be more <hi>severe
in their censures for God,</hi> than he will be for
himself.</p>
            <p>Moreover, such as were <hi>baptized</hi> in those
Churches, were not baptized into them as
particular Churches, nor <hi>initiated</hi> into them
thereby: But the Relation which ensued un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them thereon, was unto the <hi>Catholick
Church visible,</hi> together with a seperation
from the <hi>Infidel world,</hi> lying wholly in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57351:39"/>
and evil, by a dedication unto the Name
of Christ. Upon a personal avowment of that
Faith whereinto they were baptized, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
compleat Members of that Church.
Whatever state they are hereby admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
whatever benefit or priviledge they are
personally interested in, they lose them not
by the miscarriage of that particular Church
whereunto they do relate: Yea, losing the
whole advantage of an <hi>Instituted Church-state,</hi>
they may still retain whatever belongs unto
their Faith and Profession. Were <hi>Baptisme</hi>
only an Initiation into a Particular Church,
upon the failure of that Church, Baptism as to
all its benefits and Priviledges, must cease also.
We do therefore own, that amongst those
whose Assemblies are rejected by Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of their false <hi>worship and wickedness,</hi>
there may be persons truly belonging to the
Mystical Church of God, and that also by
their Profession are a portion of his Visible
Kingdome in the World. How far they do
consent unto the <hi>Abominations</hi> of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
whereunto they do belong, how far they
have Light against them, how far they do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
them, how far they repent of them,
what God will bear withall in them, we know
not, nor are called to judge. Our <hi>Love</hi> is to
be towards them as persons relating unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ in the capacity mentioned; but all
<hi>Communion</hi> with them in the Acts of false
Worship is forbidden unto us. By vertue also
of that <hi>Relation</hi> which they still continue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57351:40"/>
Christ and his Church as believers, they
have Power, and are warranted, (as it is their
Duty) to <hi>reform themselves,</hi> and to joyn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
anew in Church Order, for the due
celebration of Gospel Ordinances, unto the
Glory of Christ, and their own edification.
For it is fond to imagine, that by the sins of
others, any Disciples of Christ in any place
of the world, should be deprived of a <hi>Right</hi> to
perform their Duty towards him, when it is
discovered unto them. And these are our
thoughts concerning such Churches, as are
openly and visibly <hi>Apostatical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, There are <hi>Corruptions</hi> that may
befall or enter into Churches that are not of
so heinous a nature, as those before insisted
on: Especially if, as it often falls out, the
whole <hi>Lump be not leavened;</hi> if the whole
Body be not infected, but only some Part or
Parts of it, which others more sound do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
and give their Testimony against: And
these may have none of the pernicious conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
before mentioned. Thus many <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi>
in Doctrines, <hi>Disorders</hi> and Miscarriages
in sacred Administrations, irregular walking
in conversation, with neglect or abuse of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
in Rulers, may fall out in some Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
which yet may be so far from <hi>evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Church state,</hi> as that they give no
sufficient Warrant unto any person, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to leave their Communion, or to sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
from them. The Instances that may be
given of the failings of some of the <hi>Primitive
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57351:40"/>
Churches,</hi> in all these things, with the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the <hi>Apostolical Directions</hi> given unto
them on such Occasions, render this Assertion
evident and incontroulable. Nor do we in
the least approve of their practise (if any
such there be, that are considerable) who
upon every failing in these things in any
Church, think themselves sufficiently war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted,
immediately of their own minds, to
depart from its Communion. Much more do
we <hi>condemn them</hi> who suffer themselves in
these things to be guided by their own sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
and misapprehensions. For such there
may be, as make their own hasty conceptions
to be the Rule of all Church Administrations,
and Communion; who unless they are in all
things pleased, can be <hi>quiet</hi> no where. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when any Church, whereof a man is by
<hi>his own consent</hi> antecedently a Member, doth
fall in part or in whole from any of those
Truths which it hath professed, or when it is
overtaken with a neglect of Discipline, or
irregularities in its administration, such a one
is to consider, that he is placed in his present
state by divine Providence, that he may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
therein endeavour to put a stop unto
such Defections, and to exercise his <hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
Love and Forbearance towards the
persons of them whose Miscarriages
at present he cannot Remedy. In
such cases there is a large and spacious
Field, for <hi>Wisdom, Patience, Love</hi> and <hi>pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Zeal</hi> to exercise themselves. And it is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57351:41"/>
a most perverse Imagination, that <hi>Separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
is the only cure for Church-disorders.
All the <hi>Gifts and Graces</hi> of the Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
on Church-Members, to be exercised
in their several stations at such a season, all
<hi>Instructions</hi> given for their due improvement
unto the good of the whole; the Nature,
Rules and Laws of all Societies, declare
that all other <hi>Remedies</hi> possible and lawful,
are to be attempted, before a Church be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
deserted. But these Rules are to be
observed, provided alwayes, that it be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unlawful for <hi>any Persons,</hi> either for the
sake of Peace, or Order, or Concord, or
on any other consideration, to join actually
in any thing that is <hi>sinful,</hi> or to profess any
Opinion which is contrary to <hi>Sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
or the form of wholesome words,
which we are bound to hold fast on all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergencies.
And farther, if we may suppose,
as sure enough we may, that such a Church
so corrupted shall <hi>obstinately persist</hi> in its Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
Miscarriages, Neglects, and Mal-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations;
that it shall refuse to be warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or admonished, or being so by any means,
shall wilfully reject and despise all Intructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that it will not bear with them that are
yet sound in it, whether Elders or Members,
in peaceable Endeavors to reduce it unto the
order of the Gospel, but shall rather hurt,
persecute and seek their trouble for so doing,
whereby their <hi>Edification</hi> comes continually
to be obstructed, and their Souls to be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57351:41"/>
through the loss of Truth and
Peace; we no way doubt but that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for such persons to withdraw themselves
from the Communion of such Churches, and
that without any apprehension that they have
absolutely <hi>lost their Church-state,</hi> or are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
rejected by Jesus Christ. For the <hi>means</hi>
appointed unto any end, are to be measured
and regulated according unto their usefulness
unto that end. Aud let mens present Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
be what they will, it will one day
appear, that the end of all Church-Order,
Rule, Communion and Administrations, is
not the <hi>Grandeur</hi> or secular Advantages of
some few, not <hi>outward Peace</hi> and Quietness,
unto whose preservation the <hi>Civil Power</hi> is
ordained; but the Edification of the Souls of
men in Faith, Love, and Gospel-Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Where therefore these things are so
disposed of and mannaged, as that they do not
regularly further and promote that <hi>End,</hi> but
rather obstruct it, if they will not be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
unto their due Order and Tendency, they
may be laid aside, and made use of in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way. Much more may any refuse the
communion of such Churches, if they <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
on them</hi> their Corruptions, Errors, Fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Mistakes, as the coudition of their
Communion: For hereby they directly
make themselves <hi>Lords</hi> over the Faith and
Worship of the Disciples of Christ, and are
void of all Authority from him in what they
so do or impose. And it is so far, that any

mens <hi>withdrawing of themselves</hi> from the
communion of such Churches, and entring
into a way of Reformation for their own
good, in obedience to the Laws of Christ,
should infer in them a want of Love and
Peaceableness, or a Spirit of Division, that
to do otherwise, were to divide from Christ,
and to cast out all true Christian Love, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
a Cloud of slothful negligence and
carelesness in the great concernments of the
Glory of God, and their own Souls, in
the room thereof. We are neither the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
nor the Guides of our own Love: He
who implants and worketh it in us, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us Rules how it must be exercised, and
that on all emergencies. It may work as
regularly by sharp <hi>cutting Rebukes,</hi> as by the
most silken and compliant expressions; by
manifesting an aversation from all that is <hi>evil,</hi>
as by embracing and approving of what is
<hi>good.</hi> In all things and cases it is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by the Word: And when under the
pretence of it we leave that Rule, and go off
from any Duty which we owe immediately
unto God, it is <hi>Will, Pride,</hi> and <hi>Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi>
in us, and not Love. And among all
the Exhortations that are given us in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
unto Unity, and Concord, as the
Fruits of Love, there is not <hi>one</hi> that we
should agree or comply with any in their
sins or evil practices. But as we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in our selves to obtain <hi>from all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of evil,</hi> so are we forbidden a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57351:42"/>
in the sins of other men, and all
<hi>fellowship with unfruitful works of darkness:</hi>
Our Love towards such Churches is to work
by Pity, Compassion, Prayer, Instructions,
which are due means for their healing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery;
not by <hi>consent</hi> unto them, or <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
with them, whereby they may be
hardned in the Error of their way, and our
own Souls be subverted: For if we have
not a due respect unto the Lord Christ, and his
Authority, all that we have, or may pretend
to have unto any Church, is of no value.
Neither ought we to take into consideration
any terms of Communion, whose foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not laid in a regard thereunto.</p>
            <p>Moreover, (as hath been declared) there is
no such society of Christians in the world,
whose Assemblies, as to <hi>Instituted Worship,</hi> are
rejected by Christ, so that they have a Bill
of <hi>Divorce</hi> given unto them by the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Will of the Lord Jesus to that
purpose in the Scripture; but that until they
are utterly also as it were extirpate by the
Providence of God (as are many of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Plantations) we are perswaded of
them, that there are yet some <hi>secret hidden
ones</hi> among them, that belong unto the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of Gods Grace. For we do judge that
where-ever the Name of Jesus Christ is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon, there is salvation to be obtained;
however the wayes of it may be obstructed
unto the most<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by their own Sins and Errors.
They may also retain that Profession which
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57351:43"/>
distinguisheth them from the <hi>Infidel</hi> world.
In these things we are still to hold communion
with them; and on these accounts is our Love
to be continued unto them. Some kind of
communion we may hold with them, that
that are of <hi>no Instituted or Particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
or whose Church-State is rejected, even
as a person excommunicated is to be <hi>admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a Brother.</hi> And some kind of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
we may lawfully refuse with some true
Churches; Instances whereof shall be given
afterwards.</p>
            <p>There is therefore no necessity that any
should deny all them to be <hi>true Churches,</hi> from
whom they may have just reason to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
their communion. For such as are so,
may require such things thereunto, as it is
not lawful for them to accept of, or submit
unto. What Assemblies of Christians we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
visibly worshiping God in Christ, we
take for granted to be <hi>true visible Churches.</hi>
And when we judge of our own communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with them, it is not upon this Question,
whether they are <hi>true Churches or no,</hi> as
though the determination of our practice did
depend solely thereon: For as we are not
called to judge of the <hi>being of their Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as to the substance of it, unless they are
openly judged in the Scripture, as in the
case of Idolatry and Persecution persisted in,
so a determination of the Truth of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
or that they are true Churches,
will not presently resolve us in our Duty as
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57351:43"/>
to communion with them, for the Reasons
before given. But in such a càse, two
things are by us principally to be considered.
1. That nothing <hi>sinful</hi> in it self, or unto us,
be required of us as the condition of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
2. That we may in such Churches
obtain the immediate end of their <hi>Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and our Conjunction with them, which is
our <hi>Edification</hi> in Faith, Love and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>And the things whereof we have discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
comprize our. Thoughts concerning
<hi>those Societies</hi> of Christians, whose degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
from their primitive Rule and Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is most manifest and notorious. Whilst
there is any <hi>Profession of the Gospel,</hi> any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of Souls unto Jesus Christ avowed, or
any expectation of help from him continued
among them, we cannot but hope that there
are in all of them, at least <hi>some few Names</hi>
that are written in the <hi>Lambs Book of Life,</hi>
and which shall be saved eternally: For as
a <hi>Relation unto a particular visible Church</hi>
walking according to the Order and Rule of
the Gospel, is the Duty of every Believer
to give himself up unto; as that which is
a means appointed and sanctified to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance
of his Edification and Salvation;
so where it cannot be obtained through invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
outward <hi>Impediments,</hi> or is omitted
through ignorance of Duty, or is on just
Causes refused where opportunities make a
tender of it; or where the being and benefit
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57351:44"/>
of it is lost through the Apostasie of those
Churches whereunto any persons did belong,
the <hi>utter want</hi> of it, and that <hi>alwayes,</hi> is
not such as necessarily infers the eternal loss
of their Souls who suffer under it.</p>
            <p>Other Churches there are in the world,
which are not evidently guilty of the <hi>Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi>
in Doctrine, Worship and Discipline,
before discoursed of. These all we judge to
be <hi>true Churches</hi> of Christ; and do hope
that his promised presence is with them in
their Assemblies. Answerable hereunto is
our Judgment concerning their <hi>Officers</hi> or
Rulers, and all their Sacred Administrations.
It becomes us to think and believe, that the
<hi>one</hi> have Authority from Christ; and that
the <hi>other</hi> are accepted with him: For it is
most unwarrantable rashness and presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yea an evident fruit of Ignorance, or
want of Love, or secular private Interest,
when, upon lesser Differences men judge
<hi>Churches</hi> to be no <hi>true Churches,</hi> and their
Ministers to be no <hi>true Ministers,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
all their Administrations to be inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid.
So do some judge of Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Bishops;</hi> and so do more
of others, because they have none. But the
<hi>Validity</hi> or <hi>Invalidity</hi> of the Ordinances of
Christ, which are the Means of Union and
Communion with him unto all his Disciples,
depend not on the determination of things
highly disputable in their Notion, and not
inconsistent with true Gospel-Obedience in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57351:44"/>
their Practice. And we are unduly charged
with other Apprehensions. God forbid that
any such thought should ever enter into our
heorts, as though the Churches <hi>constituted in
all things</hi> according unto our Light, and the
Rules we apprehend appointed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for that purpose, should be the only
true Churches in the world. They do but
out of design, endeavour to expose us to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
envy and hatred, who invent and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
such things concerning us, or any of us:
But whatever be the Judgment of others <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
us,</hi> we intend not to take from thence
any such provocation as might corrupt our
Judgments <hi>concerning them;</hi> nor to relieve
our selves by returning the like censures unto
them, as we receive from them: Scripture
<hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> must in these matters regulate
our thoughts on all occasions. And whilst we
judge others to be true Churches, we shall
not be much moved with their judgment that
we are none, because we differ from them:
We stand to the judgment of Christ and his
Word. We cannot but judge indeed that
<hi>many Churches</hi> have missed, and do miss in
some things the <hi>precise Rules</hi> of their due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
and walking; that many of them have
added useless, <hi>superfluous Rites</hi> to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God among them; that there is in
many of them a sinful neglect of Evangelical
Discipline, or a carnal Rule erected in the
stead of it; that Errors in Doctrines of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
and danger, are prevalent in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57351:45"/>
of them; that their Rulers are much in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fluenced
by a spirit of bitterness and envy
against such as plead for Reformation beyond
their measure or interest; yet that hereupon
they should all or any of them immediately
<hi>forfeit their Church-State,</hi> so as to have no
lawful Ministers, nor acceptable sacred Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrations,
is in it self a false Imagination,
and such as was never by us entertained.</p>
            <p>In particular, as to those Churches in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
which are commonly called <hi>Reformed;</hi>
we have the same thoughts of them, the same
Love towards them, the same readiness for
communion with them, as we would desire
any Disciples of Christ in the world to have,
bear, or exercise towards our selves. If we
are found negligent in any <hi>Office of Love</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, or any of their Members, in
compassion, help or assistance, or such sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
in outward or inward things, as we
have opportunity or ability for, we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to bear the guilt of it as our Sin, and
the <hi>reproach</hi> of it as our shame. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we desire to <hi>fulfil the Royal Law, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Scripture, thou shalt love thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as thy self.</hi> The same we say concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all the Churches in <hi>England</hi> of the same
mould and constitution with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if it be true which some say, that <hi>Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Churches</hi> are under a force and power,
whereby they are enjoyned the practice of
sundry things, and forbidden the performance
of others, wherein the compliance of some
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57351:45"/>
is not over-voluntary, nor pleasing to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Neither is there a <hi>Nullity</hi> or <hi>Invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi>
in the Ordinances administred in them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
otherwise, than as some render them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
unto themselves by their unbelief.
And this is the <hi>Paganizing</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> which
some of us are traduced for. We believe,
that among the visible professors in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
there is as great a number of sincere
Believers as in any Nation under Heaven; so
that in it are treasured up a considerable por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>invisible Mystical Church</hi> of
Christ. We believe, that the Generality of
the Inhabitants of this Nation, are by their
Profession constituted an eminent part of the
<hi>Kingdome of Christ in this world.</hi> And we
judge not, we condemn not those, who walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to their Light and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in <hi>Particularities,</hi> do practise such things
in the Worship of God, as we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
withal. For we do not think that the
things wherein they fail, wherein they miss,
or <hi>out go the Rule,</hi> are in their own nature abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
destructive of their particular Church-state.
And what more can reasonably be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of us, or expected from us in this matter,
we know not. The causes of the <hi>Distance</hi> that
doth remain between us &amp; them, shall be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
enquired into. For our Duty in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
presential communion, at the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the same <hi>individual Ordinances,</hi> with
such Churches as are remote from us in <hi>Asia</hi>
or <hi>Africa;</hi> we shall we hope be directed to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57351:46"/>
determine aright concerning it, when we are
called thereunto. In the mean time, what
are our Thoughts concerning them, hath
been before declared: To love them as <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ</hi> in the
world, to pray for them, that they may
have all needful supplies of Grace, and the
Holy Spirit, from above, that God would <hi>send
out his Light and Truth</hi> to guide them in their
Worship and Obedience, and to help them
in things spiritual and temporal, as we have
opportunity, is the Sum of the Duty which
is required in us towards them. Those we
are more concerned in, who are within the
Lines of our ordinary Communication, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom we walk and converse in the
world: Unto any of these it is in the <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and power</hi> of every Believer to join himself
by his own consent: And no more is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
hereunto, in the present constitution of
Churches among our selves, but that a man
<hi>remove his habitation,</hi> to comply with his own
desires herein: And this choice is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated
by a judgment, how a man may best
improve and promote his own Edification.
We see not therefore how any man with the
least pretence of <hi>Sobriety or Modesty,</hi> can
charge us with the want of an esteem and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luation
of <hi>Evangelical Vnity:</hi> For we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it on all the Grounds, that it is in
the Gospel recommended unto us. And we
do know within what narrow bounds the
<hi>Charity and Vnity</hi> of some are confined, who
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57351:46"/>
yet advantage themselves by a noise of their
pretence. But that we do not in the least
disturb, break, or dissent from the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> either as it is <hi>invisible,</hi> in its inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
form, by Faith and the Renovation of
the Holy Ghost; or as <hi>visibly professing</hi> neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Fundamental Truths of the Gospel, we
have sufficiently evinced. And the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
laid down concerning particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
Congregations, Assemblies or <hi>Parishes,</hi>
have not as yet been detected by any to spring
from want of Love, or to be obstructive of
the exercise of it. Having therefore thus
briefly given some account of what we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be our duty in relation unto the
<hi>whole Church</hi> of God, we can with confidence
and much assurance of mind, own as dear a
valuation of Love, Unity and Peaceableness
in the Profession of the Gospel, as any sort
of Professors whatever. And we are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that <hi>our Principles</hi> do as much tend and
and conduce unto the improvement of them,
as any that are, or can be proposed unto that
end. For we either do, or are in a readiness
to embrace every thing or way, that the
Lord Christ hath appointed, or doth bless
thereunto.</p>
            <p>We doubt not, as hath been before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
but that there have been many
<hi>failings</hi> and <hi>sinful miscarriages</hi> among all sorts
of Professors, who <hi>separate,</hi> or are rather dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from the present Publick worship. There
is no question but that in them all, there are
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57351:47"/>
some remainders of the <hi>bitter Root</hi> of corrupt
affections, which under the various temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and provocations they have been exposed
unto, hath brought forth fruit of an unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
relish. It is no new thing that <hi>irregular
prejudices</hi> should be found acting themselves
in Professors of the Gospel: It hath been so
among them from the Beginning. And we
hope that where there is, or hath been any
guilt of this nature, that the Reproofs which
have been publickly given unto it (with what
Spirit or Intention soever mannaged) may
be useful to the amendment of them who
have offended. But for our own Parts, we
must bear this Testimony unto our sincerity,
that we not only condemn, but abhor all <hi>evil
surmises</hi> among Professors, all rash and <hi>uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
censures,</hi> all causless aversations of
Mind and Affections, all <hi>strife, wrath, anger,</hi>
and <hi>debate,</hi> upon the account of different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
and practises in and about the
concerns of Religious worship. Much more do
we cast out all thoughts of <hi>judging mens eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
state</hi> and condition, with respect unto such
differences; nor do we, nor dare we, give
countenance unto any thing that is in the
least really opposite to love, Peace, Unity, or
Concord, amongst the Disciples of Christ.
And as we shall not excuse any of those <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies</hi>
and intemperate Heats, in words
or otherwise, which some it may be have
been guilty of, who until their Repentance
must bear their own Judgment; so we will
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57351:47"/>
not make a recharge on others who differ in
Perswasion from us, of the same or the like
crimes; nor indeed need we so to do, their
<hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practises,</hi> contrary unto all
Christian Love and Charity, being written as
with the beams of the Sun. And we do not
complain of our Lot in the world, that the
<hi>appearance</hi> of such things iu any of us would
be esteemed a scandalous crime, which others
that condemn them in us, indulg in themselves
without the least check or controul. The <hi>Law</hi>
of this condition is put upon us by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
which we do avow. Only we are not
willing that any should make advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us by their Pleas, for Love, Unity, and
Concord, as if indeed <hi>they were for Peace,</hi> but
that we <hi>make our selves ready for warr.</hi> Could
they convince us that we come behind them
in the <hi>valuation</hi> and <hi>secking after</hi> these things
by all ways and means blessed by Christ to
that purpose, we should judge our selves with
a severity at least commensurate to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
they are able to exercise against us,
whilst free from malice and evil designs. Only
we must adde, that there is no true <hi>measure</hi> of
Love, to be taken by the Accessions that men
can make towards them who depart from
Truth. If it were so, those must be judged to
abound most with it, who can most comply
with the practises of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> But
we are perswaded that such <hi>Discourses,</hi> with
the application of them unto those who differ
from their Authors, do proceed from <hi>sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:57351:48"/>
in them; only, as we fear, somwhat leaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with an apprehension that their Judgments
and Practices being according unto truth,
ought to be the <hi>Standard and Measure</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens; perhaps no less sincere and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the Truth than themselves, though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from them. And hence it is unhappily
fallen out, that in the Reproofs which some do
mannage on the foundations mentioned, and
in the way of their mannagement, many do
suppose that there is as great an appearance,
if not evidence of <hi>evil surmises,</hi> ungrounded
temerarious censures, of self-conceit and ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mind, of hard thoughts of, undue
charges on, and the contempt of others, and
in all of a want of real love, condescention, and
compassion, as in any things that are true, and
to be really found among Professors blamed
by them. For these things, both as charged
and recharged, have a double appearance.
Those from whom they proceed look on them
in the <hi>light of that sincerity and integrity</hi> which
they are conscious of to themselves, wherein
they seem amiable, useful, and free from all
offence; whereas others that are concerned
viewing of them in the <hi>disordered Reflections</hi>
of their opposition unto them, and the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
which they undergo by them,
do apprehend them quite of another nature.
And it is a matter of trouble unto us, to find
that when some are <hi>severely handled</hi> for those
Principles and ways wherein they can, and
do commend their Consciences unto God, and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57351:48"/>
thereby apprehending that their Intentions,
Purposes, Principles and Affections, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juriously
traduced and perverted, they fall
with an <hi>equal severity</hi> on them by whom they
are reproved, though their Reproofs proceed
from an <hi>equal Sincerity</hi> unto what themselves
profess, and expect to be believed in. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
are such <hi>mutual Reflections</hi> grievous
and irksome unto Men, when they apprehend
that in them, or by them, Professed Friends
do industriously expose them to the contempt
and wrath of Professed Adversaries.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>UPon the whole matter, it is generally
acknowledged that there is a great <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
of Love,</hi> a great want of Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
among Professors of the Gospel in the
world. And it is no less evident, nor less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57351:49"/>
that these things are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
commanded and enjoyned unto them in
the Scripture. Might they be obtained it
would greatly further the <hi>Ends of the Gospel,</hi>
and answer the mind of Christ: And their
<hi>Loss</hi> is obstructive unto the one, and no less
dishonourable unto that Profession which is
made of the Name of the other. For the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions</hi>
of Christians (occasioned chiefly by
false notions of Unity, and undue means of
attaining it) are the chief cause of Offences
unto them who are yet strangers from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.
The <hi>Jews</hi> object unto us the <hi>Wars</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Christians, which they suppose shall have
no place under the Kingdom and Reign of the
<hi>true Messiah.</hi> And we have been reproached
with our intestine Differences by <hi>Gentiles</hi> and
<hi>Mahumetans.</hi> For those who never had either
Peace or Love, or Unity among themselves,
do yet think meet to revile us with the want
of them; because they know how highly we
are obliged unto them. But any Men may be
justly charged with the neglect <hi>of that Duty</hi>
which they profess, if they be found defective
therein. Under the sad Effects of the want of
these things we may labour long enough, if
we endeavour not to take away ihe <hi>Causes</hi> of
it. And yet in the entrance of our Disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
after them we are again entangled. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
cannot come to an Agreement about
these Causes, and so live under the severity
of their Effects, as not being able to conclude
on a Remedy. The multitude of them is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57351:50"/>
here divided, and <hi>one cryeth one thing, another
another:</hi> Most place the Cause of all our Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
in a <hi>dissent from themselves,</hi> and their
Judgments: Yea they do so apparently,
who yet disavow their so doing. And it may
be here expected that we should give some ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of our thoughts as to the <hi>Causes</hi> of these
Differences whereof we also have <hi>now</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
so far as they are contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or Obstructive of the Ends of the Gospel.
We shall therefore briefly endeavour the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
of such as may have those Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Particular Evils which contribute much
unto our <hi>Divisions,</hi> we shall not insist upon;
much less shall we reflect upon, and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
the failings of others, whether Persons or
Societies. Some of the Principal and more
General Reasons, and <hi>Causes</hi> of them, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
amongst <hi>Protestants,</hi> it shall suffice us
to enumerate.</p>
            <p>The Principal <hi>Cause</hi> of our Divisions and
<hi>Schisms</hi> is no other than the Ignorance or
Misapprehension that is among Christians, of
the <hi>true nature of that Evangelical Vnity,</hi>
which they ought to follow after, with the
ways and means whereby it may be attained
and preserved. Hence it is come to pass, that
in the greatest Pleas for <hi>Vnity,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
after it, most men have pursued a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and <hi>fought uncertainly, as those that beat
the Air.</hi> For having lost the very <hi>notion of
Gospel Vnity,</hi> and not loving the thing its self,
under what terms soever proposed unto them,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57351:50"/>
they consigned the Name of it unto, and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with its ornaments and Priviledges a vain
<hi>Figment</hi> of their own, which the Lord Christ
never required, nor ever blessed any in their
Endeavours to attain. And when they had
changed the <hi>End,</hi> it was needful for them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to change the <hi>Means</hi> of attaining it; and
to substitute those in their Room which were
suited to the new Mark and Aim they had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
Farther to evidence these things we
shall give some account of the <hi>Nature of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical
Vnity,</hi> the means of attaining it;
with the false notion of it that some have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,
and the corrupt means which they
have used for the compassing of the same.</p>
            <p>First, that Unity which is recommended
unto us in the Gospel is <hi>spiritual;</hi> and in that
which is purely so, lies the Foundation of the
whole.<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 3, 4.</note> Hence it is called the <hi>Vnity of the
Spirit,</hi> which is to be <hi>kept in the bond of Peace;</hi>
because <hi>there is one Body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 17. 21, 22.</note> 
               <hi>and one Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
that Body is animated.</hi> Thus all true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
become <hi>one in the Father and the Son;</hi>
or <hi>perfect in one.</hi> It is their Participation of,
and quickening by the same Spirit that is in
Christ Jesus, whereby they become his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or Members of it,<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 30</note> 
               <hi>even of his flesh and of his
bones;</hi> that is, no less really Partakers of the
<hi>same Divine</hi> Spiritual <hi>Nature</hi> with him,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4</note> than
<hi>Eve</hi> was of the Nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> when she
was made <hi>of his fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sh and his bones.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 5 2. 3</note> The real
Union of all true Believers unto the Lord
Christ as their Head, wrought by his Spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:57351:51"/>
which dwelleth in them, and communicates
of his Grace unto them, is that which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend.
For as hereby they become one with,
and <hi>in</hi> him, so they come to be one among
themselves, as his <hi>Body;</hi> and all the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Body</hi> being many are yet but one
Body, wherein their oneness among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
doth consist. The <hi>Members of the Body</hi>
have divers forms or shapes, divers uses and
Operations, much more may be <hi>diversly cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed</hi>
and adorned; yet are they one Body
still, wherein this Unity doth consist. And
it were a ridiculous thing to attempt the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of a dead useless Unity among the
Members of the Body, by <hi>cloathing</hi> of them all
in the same kind of Garments or Covering.
But granting them their <hi>Vnity</hi> by their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
unto the Head, and thence to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
unto the Constitution of the whole; and
their different Forms, shapes, Uses, Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ornaments, all tend to make them ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable
in their Unity unto their proper
Ends. And saith the Apostle, <hi>as the Body is
one, and hath many Members, and all the
Members of that one Body being many are one
body,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12 12, 13.</note> 
               <hi>so also is Christ. For by one Spirit we
are all baptized into one Body, whether we be
Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free,
and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</hi>
And he doth elsewhere so describe this Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Unity of Believers in one Body, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and in dependance on the <hi>same Head,</hi>
as to make it the only means of the usefulness
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57351:51"/>
and Preservation of the whole.<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>They grow up
into him in all things which is the Head even
Christ: From whom the whole Body fitly joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together and compacted by that which every
joynt supplyeth, according to the effectual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the measure of every part, maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the Body unto the Edifying of its self in
Love.</hi> The conjunction of all the Members
into one Body, their mutual usefulness unto
one another, the Edification of the whole,
with its <hi>increase,</hi> the due exercise of Love,
(which things contain the whole nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
the utmost Ends of all <hi>Church-Communion</hi>)
do depend meerly and solely upon, and flow
from, the Relation that the <hi>Members</hi> have
to the <hi>Head,</hi> and their Union with him. He
speaketh again to the same purpose in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
of them who <hi>hold not the Head,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 2. 19</note> 
               <hi>from
which all the Body by joynts and bands having
nourishment ministred and knit together, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
with the increase of God.</hi> This is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all <hi>Gospel Vnity</hi> among Believers,
whereunto all other things which are required
unto the compleating of it, are but accessory;
nor are they without <hi>this,</hi> of any value or
acceptation in the sight of God. Whatever
Order, Peace, Concord, <hi>Vnion</hi> in the Church,
any one may hold or keep, who is not inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested
herein, he is but like a <hi>Stone in a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
laid it may be in a comely order, but
not <hi>cemented</hi> and fixed unto the whole, which
renders its station <hi>useless</hi> to the building, and
unsafe unto its self: or like a dead, mortifyed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57351:52"/>
part of the Body, which neither receives any
<hi>vital Influence</hi> from the Head, nor administers
nourishment unto any other part. Now it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denyed but that in the Contests that
are in the world about <hi>Church Vnion and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,</hi>
with what is pleaded about their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Causes, there is little or no consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
had thereof. Yea those things are
principally insisted on, for the constituting of
the <hi>One,</hi> atd the according of the <hi>Other,</hi>
which cast a neglect, yea a contempt upon it.
It is the <hi>Romanists</hi> who make the greatest out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryes
about Church Union, and who make
the greatest <hi>Advantage</hi> by what they pretend
so to be. But hereunto they contend ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
on the one side, that it is indispensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
necessary that all Christians should be
<hi>subject to the Pope of Rome,</hi> and united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; and on the other, that it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
at all that any of them be <hi>spiritually</hi>
and <hi>savingly united unto Christ.</hi> Others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
place it in various Instances of Conformity
unto, and Complyance with the Commands
of Men, which if they are observed, they
are wondrous cold in their enquiries after this
<hi>Relation unto the Head.</hi> But the truth is,
that where any one is interested in this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all Gospel Unity, he may <hi>demand
Communion</hi> with any Church in the world,
and ought not to be refused, unless in Case of
some present <hi>Offence</hi> or scandal. And those
by whom such Persons are <hi>rejected from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi>
to be held on Gospel terms, on the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57351:52"/>
account of some Differences not entrenching
on this Foundation, do exercise a kind of
<hi>Church Tyranny,</hi> and are guilty of the <hi>Schism</hi>
which may ensue thereon. So on the other
side, where this is <hi>wanting,</hi> mens complyance
with any other terms or conditions that may
be proposed unto them, and their obtaining
of Church-Communion thereon, will be of
little Advantage unto their Souls.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Unto this <hi>Foundation of Gospel</hi>
Unity among Believers, for and unto the due
improvement of it, there is required an <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Faith;</hi> or of the belief and Profession
of the same Divine Truth. For as there is
<hi>one Lord,</hi> so also <hi>one Faith</hi> and <hi>one Baptism</hi>
unto Believers. And this ariseth from, and
followeth the other. For those who are so
united unto Christ, are <hi>all taught of God</hi> to
believe the Truths which are necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
thereunto. And however by the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Temptation they may fall in it, or from
it for a season, as did <hi>Peter,</hi> yet through the
Love and care of Jesus Christ, they are again
recovered. Now unto this <hi>Vnity of Faith</hi>
two things are required. First, a precise and
express Professio 1 of the <hi>Fundamental Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>
of Christian Religion. For we outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>hold the Head</hi> by a consent unto the <hi>form
of wholsome words</hi> wherein the Doctrine of it
is contained. Of the Number and Nature of
such <hi>Fundamental Truths,</hi> whose express Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
belongs unto the Unity of
Faith, so much hath been discoursed by others,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57351:53"/>
as that we need not add any thing thereunto.
The sum is, that they are but <hi>few, plainly</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in the Scripture; <hi>evidencing</hi> their
own necessity; all conducing to the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and increase of that Spiritual Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we live unto God. Secondly, It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
hereunto, that in other things and
Duties,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 5.</note> every man <hi>be fully perswaded in his own
mind,</hi> and walking according to what he hath
attained,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15</note> do follow Peace and Love, with
those who are otherwise perswaded than he is.
For the <hi>Vnity of Faith</hi> did never consist in the
same precise Conceptions of all revealed Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:
Neither the nature of Man, nor the
means of Revelation, will allow such a Unity
to be morally Possible. And the figment of
supplying this variety by an <hi>implicit Faith,</hi> is
ridiculous. For herein Faith is considered as
<hi>professed;</hi> and no man can <hi>make profession</hi> of
what he knoweth not. It is therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention
and <hi>mutual forbearance</hi> whereby
the <hi>Vnity of Faith</hi> consisting in the joynt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of necessary Truths, is to be preserved
with respect unto other things about which
Differences may arise.</p>
            <p>Yet is not this so to be understood, as
though Christians, especially <hi>Ministers of the
Gospel,</hi> should content themselves with the
knowledge of such <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> or confine
their Scripture inquiries unto them. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is written in the Scripture<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 12.</note> is <hi>written for
our instruction;</hi> and it is our duty to search
diligently into the whole Counsel of God
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57351:53"/>
therein revealed:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 13, 14, 15, 16.</note> Yea to inquire with <hi>all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,</hi>
in the use of all means, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of all advantages, with fervent
supplications for light and aid from above,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15, 16, 17.</note>
into the whole <hi>Mistery of the will of God,</hi> as
revealed in the Scripture, and all the Parts of
it<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 10, 11.</note>, is the principal duty that is incumbent on
us in this world. Aud those who take upon
them to be <hi>Ministers</hi> and Instructors of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
by whom this is neglected, who take up
with a superficiary knowledg of general
Principles, and those such for the most part
as have a coincidence with the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
do but betray the souls of those over
whom they usurp a charge, and are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Title and Office which they bear.
Neither is there any thing implyed in the
means of preserving the <hi>Vnity of Faith,</hi> that
should hinder us from explaining, confirming
and vindicating, <hi>any Truth</hi> that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
wherein others differ from us; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
that what we do, be done with a spirit
of meekness and love: Yea, our so doing is
one principal means of <hi>ministring nourishment</hi>
unto the Body, whereby the whole is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
as with the increase of God.</p>
            <p>But in the Room of all this, what contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
fightings, destructions of men, body and
soul, upon variety of Judgments about sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
things, have been introduced by the
<hi>Craft of Satan,</hi> and the carnal interest of men
of corrupt minds, is known to all the world.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, There is an <hi>Vnity of Love,</hi> that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57351:54"/>
belongs unto the Evangelical Unity which
we are in the description of. For <hi>Love is the
bond of perfection;</hi> that whereby all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Body of Christ are knit together
among themselves, and which renders all the
other ingredients of this Unity useful unto
them. And as we have discoursed of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of this <hi>Love</hi> before, so the exercise of it,
as it hath an actual influence into <hi>Gospel Vnity</hi>
among Christians, may be reduced unto two
Heads. For, First, it worketh effectually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the measure of them in whom it is,
in the <hi>Contribution of supplyes of Grace and
Light,</hi> and helps of obedience, unto other
Members of the body. Every one in whom
this Love dwelleth, according to his Ability,
Call, and Opportunities, which make up his
<hi>measure,</hi> will communicate the spiritual sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
which he receiveth from the Head Christ
Jesus unto others, by Instructions, Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Consolations and Example, unto their
Edification. This he will do in <hi>Love,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ends of Love; namely, to testifie a joynt
Relation unto Christ the Head of all, and the
increase of the whole by supplyes of life from
him. Instead hereof, some have invented <hi>bonds
of Ecclesiastical Vnity,</hi> which may outwardly
bind men together in some appearance of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whilst in the mean time they live in <hi>envy,
wrath,</hi> and <hi>malice,</hi> biting and devouring one
another; or if there be <hi>any thing of Love</hi>
among them; it is that which is meerly <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi>
or carnal and sensual, working by a joynt
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57351:54"/>
consent in delights and pleasure, or at best in
<hi>Civil things,</hi> belonging unto their conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in this world. The love that is among
such persons <hi>in</hi> this world, is <hi>of</hi> the world, and
will perish with the world, But it is a far ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier
thing to satisfie Conscience with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>preserving Church Unity,</hi> by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiescency
in some outward Rules and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
wherein mens minds are little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
than to attend diligently unto the
due exercise of this <hi>Grace of Love,</hi> against all
Oppositions and Temptations unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
For indeed the exercise of this Love
requires a sedulous and painful labour, <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 10. But yet this is that alone which is the
<hi>Bond of Perfection</hi> unto the Disciples of
Christ, and without which, all other preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or appearances of Unity, are of no value
with him. Secondly, This Love acts it self
by <hi>forbearance</hi> and <hi>condescention</hi> towards the
Infirmities, mistakes, and faults of others;
wherein, of what singular use it is for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Church Peace, and Order, the
Apostle at large declares, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19, 20.</note> The Lord Christ by his Kingly
Authority hath instituted <hi>Orders for Rule,</hi> and
<hi>Ordinances for Worship,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</note> to be observed in all
his Churches. That they be attended unto,
and celebrated in a due manner, belongs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>unity</hi> which he requires among his
Disciples. To this end he communicates sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes
of spiritual ability and wisdome, or the
Gifts of his Spirit, unto the Guides and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57351:55"/>
of his Churches, for their administration
unto edification. And hereon, if a submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto his Authority be accompanyed with
a due attendance unto the Rule of the Word,
no such <hi>variety</hi> or difference will ensue, as
shall impeach that Unity which is the Duty of
them all to attend unto.</p>
            <p>In these things doth consist that <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Church Vnity</hi> which the Gospel recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
unto us,<note place="margin">John 17. 20, 21, 22.</note> and which the Lord Christ
prayed for with respect unto all <hi>that should
believe on his Name.</hi> One Spirit, one Faith,
one Love, one Lord, there ought to be in
and unto them all. In the possession of <hi>this
Vnity,</hi> and no other, were the first Churches
left by the <hi>Apostle:</hi> And had they in succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Generations continued according to their
Duty, in the preservation and liberty of it,
all those <hi>scandalous Divisions</hi> which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
fell out among them on the account of
<hi>Pre-eminences,</hi> Jurisdictions, Liturgies, Rites,
Ceremonies, violently or fraudulently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
on their Communion, had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ways</hi> and <hi>means</hi> whereby this <hi>Vnity</hi>
may be obtained and preserved amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10 4, 5.</note>
are evident from the Nature of it:
For whereas it is <hi>Spiritual,</hi> none other are
suited thereunto; nor hath the Lord Christ
appointed any other,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 20.</note> but his Spirit and his
Word. For to this end doth he promise the
presence of his Spirit among them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 16.</note>
unto the consummation of all things.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57351:55"/>
And this he doth, both as to <hi>lead</hi> and <hi>guide
them into all Truth</hi> necessary unto the Ends
mentioned; so to assist and help them in the
orderly performances of their Duties in and
about them. His <hi>Word</hi> also, as the Rule which
they are to attend unto, he hath committed
unto them; and other ways and means for
the compassing of this end, besides the due
improvement of spiritual Assistances, in a
compliance with the holy Rule, he hath not
designed or appointed.</p>
            <p>This is that <hi>Gospel-Vnity</hi> which we are to
labour after; and these are the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
we may do so. But now through the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
of the minds of men, with the strong
influence which carnal and corrupt Interests
have upon them, we know how it hath been
despised, and what hath been set up in the
room thereof; and what have been the <hi>means</hi>
whereby it hath been pursued and promoted.
We may take an Instance in those of the
<hi>Church of Rome.</hi> No sort of Christians in
the world (as we have already observed) do
at this day more <hi>pretend unto Vnity,</hi> or more
press the necessity of it, or more fiercely
judge, oppose and destroy others for the
breach of it, which they charge upon them;
nor more prevail or advantage themselves by
the pretence of it, than do they: But yet
notwithstanding all their Preten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, it will
not be denied, but that the <hi>Vnity</hi> which they
so make their boast of, and press upon others,
is a thing utterly <hi>forreign to the Gospel,</hi> and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57351:56"/>
destructive of that Peace, Union and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
among Christians, which it doth require.
They know how highly Unity is <hi>commended
in the Scripture,</hi> how much it is to be prized
and valued by all true Believers, how accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
it is to Jesus Christ, and how severely
they are condemned who break it, or despise
it: These things they press, and plead, and
make their advantage by. But when we come
to enquire what it is that they intend by
<hi>Church-Vnity,</hi> they tell us long Stories of
<hi>Subjection unto the Pope,</hi> to the Church in
its Dictates and Resolutions, without farther
examination, meerly because they are theirs.
Now these things are not only of <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
nature</hi> and kind than the Unity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
commended unto us by Jesus Christ, but
perfectly inconsistent with them, and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
of them. And as they would impose
upon us a <hi>corrupt confederacy</hi> for their own
secular Advantage, in the room of the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Unity of the Gospel; so it was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that they should find out means sutable
unto its Accomplishment and Preservation;
as distant from the means appointed by Christ,
for the attaining of <hi>Gospel-Vnion,</hi> as their
carnal Confederacy is from the thing its self.
And they have done accordingly: For the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing</hi>
men by all wayes of deceit and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
violence, unto a compliance with, and
submission unto their Orders, is the great
Expedient for the establishment and preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their perverse Union, that they have
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57351:56"/>
fixed on. Now that this <hi>Fictitious Vnity,</hi>
and corrupt carnal pursuit of it, have been
the greatest occasion and causes of begetting,
fomenting and continuing the <hi>Divisions</hi> that
are among Christians in the world, hath been
indeniably proved by Learned men of all
sorts. And so it will fall out, where-ever
any reject the Union of Christs Institutions,
and substitute in the room thereof, an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their own Invention; as his will be
utterly <hi>lost,</hi> so they will not be able to <hi>retain</hi>
their own.</p>
            <p>Thus others also not content with those
bounds and measures which the Gospel hath
fixed unto the <hi>Vnity of Christians</hi> and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
will have it to consist almost wholly in
an <hi>outward Conformity</hi> unto certain Rites,
Orders, Ceremonies, and Modes of Sacred
Administrations, which themselves have ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
invented and found out, or do observe
and approve. Whoever dissents from them
in these things, must immediately be brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> a Divider of the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
Vnity,</hi> and an enemy unto the Peace and
Order of it. Howbeit, of <hi>Conformity</hi> unto
such Institutions and Orders of men, of <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity</hi>
in the observation of such external
Rites in the worship of the Church, there is
not one word spoken, nor any thing of that
nature intimated, in all the <hi>Commands for V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
which are given unto us, nor in the
Directions that are sanctified unto the due
preservation of it. Yet such an <hi>Vniformity,</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:57351:57"/>
being set up in the room of Evangelical Unity
and Order; Means suited unto the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it, but really destructive of that
whose name it beareth, and whose Place it
possesseth, have not been wanting. And
it is not unworthy consideration, how men
endeavour to deceive others, and are deceived
themselves, by manifold <hi>Equivocations</hi> in
their arguings about this Matter. For first,
they lay down the <hi>necessity of Vnity</hi> among
Christians, with the evil that is in Breaches,
Divisions and Schismes; which they prove
from the Commands of the one, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
of the other, that abound in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
Then, with an easie deduction, they
prove that it is a Duty incumbent on all
Christians in their several Capacities to <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
keep, further,</hi> and <hi>promote this Vnity,</hi>
and to prevent, oppose, resist and avoid all
Divisions that are contrary thereunto. If
so, the <hi>Magistrate</hi> must do the same in his
place and capacity. Now seeing it is his <hi>Office,</hi>
and unto him of God it is committed, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
his power, in Laws and Penalties, for
the promoting of what is good, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
of what is contrary thereunto, it is
his <hi>Duty to coerce, restrain and punish all those
who oppose,</hi> despise, or any way break or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb
the Unity of the Church. And this
Ratiocination would seem <hi>reasonable,</hi> were it
not doubly defective: For first, the <hi>Vnity</hi>
intended in the first Proposition, whose neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
is confirmed by Scripture-Testimonies, is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57351:57"/>
               <hi>utterly lost</hi> before we come to the Conclusion;
and the <hi>outward Vniformity</hi> mentioned, is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
in the room thereof. And hereby, in
the second place, are they deceived to believe,
that <hi>external force and penalties</hi> are a means
to be used by any for the attaining or preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of <hi>Gospel-Vnity.</hi> It is not improbable
indeed, but that it may be suited to give
countenance unto that <hi>external Vniformity</hi>
which is intended; but that it should be so
unto the promotion of <hi>Gospel-Vnion</hi> among
Believers, is a weak imagination. Let such
persons keep themselves and their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto <hi>that Vnion</hi> which the Scripture
commends amongst the Disciples of Christ,
and his Churches, with the means fitted and
appointed unto the preservation of it, and
they shall have our compliance with any
Conclusion that will thence ensue.</p>
            <p>Herein therefore lies the <hi>Fundamental Cause
of our Divisions,</hi> which will not be healed,
until it be removed and taken out of the way.
Leave Believers or Professors of the Gospel
unto their Duty in seeking after <hi>Evangelical
Vnity</hi> in the use of other <hi>Means</hi> instituted
and blessed unto that End; impose nothing
on their Consciences or Practice under that
<hi>Name</hi> which indeed belongs not thereunto;
and although upon the Reasons and Causes
afterwards to be mentioned, there may <hi>for
a season</hi> remain some Divisions among them,
yet there will be a <hi>way of healing</hi> continually
ready for them, and agreed upon by them
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57351:58"/>
as such. Where indeed men propose unto
themselves <hi>different Ends,</hi> though under the
<hi>same Name,</hi> the use of the <hi>same Means</hi> for
the compassing of them, will but encrease their
variance. As where some aim at <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Vnion,</hi> and others at an <hi>External Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi>
both under the name of <hi>Vnity</hi> and
Peace. in the use of the same Means, for
these Ends, they will be more divided among
themselves. But where the <hi>same End</hi> is aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at, even the <hi>debate of the Means</hi> for the
attaining of it, will insensibly bring the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
at difference into a Coalition, and work
out in the issue a compleat Reconciliation.
In the mean time, were Christians duly instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
how, many <hi>lesser Differences</hi> in Mind,
Judgment and Practice, are really consistent
with the Nature, Ends, and genuine Fruit
of the <hi>Vnity</hi> that Christ requires among them,
it would undoubtedly prevail with them so
to mannage themselves in their Differences
by mutual forbearance and condescention in
Love, as not to contract the guilt of being
Disturbers or Breakers of it. For suppose
the Minds of any of them to be invincibly
prepossessed with the <hi>Principles</hi> wherein they
differ from others; yet all who are <hi>sincere</hi> in
their Profession, cannot but rejoyce to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
unto such a <hi>Mannagery</hi> of them, as
to be preserved from the guilt of dissolving
the Unity appointed by Christ to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.
And to speak plainly, among all the
Churches in the world which are free from I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57351:58"/>
and Persecution, it is not <hi>different
Opinions,</hi> or a difference in Judgment about
revealed Truths, nor a different practice in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Administrations, but <hi>Pride, Self-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
Love of Honour,</hi> Reputation, and
Dominion, with the influence of Civil or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
Intrigues and Considerations, that are
the true cause of that defect of <hi>Evangelical
Vnity</hi> that is at this day amongst them. For
set them aside, and the real differences which
would remain, may be so mannaged in <hi>Love,
Gentleness</hi> and <hi>Meekness,</hi> as not to interfere
with that <hi>Vnity</hi> which Christ requireth them
to preserve: Nothing will from thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
which shall impeach their common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in <hi>one Lord, one Faith, one Love, one
Spirit,</hi> and the Administration of the same
Ordinances according to their Light and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.
But if we shall cast away this <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Vnion</hi> among the Disciples and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of Christ, if we shall break up the
Bounds and Limits fixed unto it, and set up in
its place a compliance with, or an agreement
in the Commands and Appointments of men,
making their Observations the Rule and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of our <hi>Ecclesiastical Concord,</hi> it cannot
be, but that innumerable and endless Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will ensue thereon. If we will not be
contented with the Union that Christ hath
appointed, it is certain we shall have none in
this world. For concerning that which is
of <hi>mens finding out,</hi> there have been and will
be Contentions and Divisions, whilst there
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57351:59"/>
are any on the one side who will endeavour its
imposition; and on the other, who desire to
preserve their Consciences entire unto the
Authority of Christ in his Laws and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>There is none who can be such a <hi>Stranger
in our Israel,</hi> as not to know that these things
have been the great Occasion and Cause of
of the Divisions and Contentions that have
been among us, near an hundred years, and
which at this day make our Breaches wide
like the Sea; that they cannot be healed. Let
therefore those who have <hi>Power and Ability,</hi>
be instrumental to restore to the minds of
men the true <hi>Notion and Knowledge</hi> of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
which the Lord Christ requireth among
his Churches and Disciples; and let <hi>them</hi> be
left unto that Liberty which he hath purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
for them, in the pursuit of that <hi>Vnity</hi>
which he hath prescribed unto them; and let
us all labour to stir up those Gracious
Principles of Love and Peace, which
ought to guide us in the use of our Liberty,
and will enable us to preserve Gospel-Unity,
and there will be a greater Progress made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Peace, Reconciliation and Concord,
amongst all sorts of Christians, than the <hi>spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Goods,</hi> or imprisoning of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Dissenters, will ever effect. But it
may be such things are required here unto, as
the world is yet scarce able to comply with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.
For whilst men do <hi>hardly believe</hi> that
there is an efficacy and power accompanying
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57351:59"/>
the Institutions of Christ, for the compassing of
that whole end which he aimeth at and intendeth;
whilst they are <hi>unwilling</hi> to be brought unto the
constant exercise of that spiritual Diligence, Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Meekness, Condescention, Self-Denial, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation
of the world, and Conformity thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
which are indispensibly necessary in Church-Guides,
and Church-Members, according to their
measure, unto the attaining and preservation of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Unity;
but do satisfie themselves in the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of an <hi>Ecclesiastical Vnion,</hi> into a subordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto their own secular Interests, by external
force and power; we have very <hi>small expectation
of success</hi> in the way proposed. In the mean time
we are herewith satisfied. Take the Churches of
Christ in the world that are not infected with <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
or <hi>Persecution,</hi> and restore their <hi>Vnity</hi> unto the
Terms and Conditions left unto them by Christ
and his Apostles; and if in any thing we are found
uncompliant therewithal, we shall without repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
bear the reproach of it, and hasten an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Another Cause of the evil Effects and Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
mentioned, is the great <hi>neglect that hath
been in Churches, and Church-Rulers, in the pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the open direct Ends of the Gospel,</hi> both as
to the Doctrine and Discipline of it. This hath
been such, and so evident in the world, that it is
altogether in vain for any to deny it, or to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
an Excuse of it. And men have no reason
to flatter themselves, that whilst they live in an <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
neglect</hi> of their own Duty, others will always,
according to their wills or Desires, attend with
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57351:60"/>
diligence unto what they prescribe unto them. If
<hi>Churches</hi> or their <hi>Rulers</hi> would excuse or justifie
their Members, in all the evils that may befal
them through their Miscarriages and Mal-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
it might justly be expected that they
should go along with them, under their conduct,
whither-ever they should lead them. But if it can
never be obliterated out of the Minds and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of men, that they must <hi>every one live by his
own Faith,</hi> and every one give an <hi>account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto God,</hi> and that every one, notwithstanding
the interposition of the help of Churches and their
Rulers, is obliged immediately in his own person,
to take care of his whole Duty towards God; it
cannot be, but that in such cases, they will <hi>judge
for themselves,</hi> and what is meet for them to do. In
case therefore that they find the Churches where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they do relate under the guilt of the <hi>neglect</hi>
mentioned, it is probable that they will provide for
themselves and their own safety. In this state of
things it is morally impossible, but that <hi>Differences</hi>
and <hi>Divisions</hi> will fall out, which might all of them
have been prevented, had there been a due atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
unto the Work, Doctrine, Order and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of the Gospel, in the Churches that were
in possession of the Care and Administration of
them. For it is hard for men to believe, that by
the Will and Command of Christ they are inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
shut up under spiritual disadvantages; seeing
it is certain that he hath ordered all things in the
Church for their Edification. But the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some particular Instances, will render this
<hi>Cause of our Divisions</hi> more evident and manifest.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:57351:60"/>
The first End of Preaching the Gospel is the
<hi>Conversion of the Souls of men unto God,</hi> Acts 26.
17, 18. This we suppose will not be questioned, nor
denied. That the work hereof in all Churches
ought to be attended and pursued with <hi>Zeal,</hi> Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
Labour and Care, all accompanied with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and fervent Prayers for success in and by the
<hi>Ministers and Rulers of them,</hi> (1 Tim. 5. 17. 2 Tim.
4. 1, 2.) is a Truth also that will not admit of any
Controversie among them that believe the Gospel.
Herein principally do men in Office in the Church,
exercise and manifest their <hi>Zeal</hi> for the Glory of
God, their compassion towards the Souls of men,
and acquit themselves faithfully in the Trust com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto them by the <hi>great Shepherd of the Sheep,</hi>
Christ Jesus. If now in any Assembly, or other
Societies professing themselves to be <hi>Churches of
Christ,</hi> and claiming the Right and Power of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
towards all persons living within the bounds or
limits which they have prescribed unto themselves,
<hi>this work</hi> be either totally neglected, or carelesly &amp;
perfunctorily attended unto; if those on whom it
is <hi>immediately incumbent,</hi> do either suppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
free from any Obligation thereunto, upon the
pretence of other Engagements; or do so dispose
of themselves in their <hi>relation unto many Charges</hi> or
Employments, as that it is impossible they should
duly attend unto it, or are <hi>unable and insufficient</hi> for
it; so that indeed there is not in such Churches a
due representation of the Love, Care and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Lord Jesus Christ towards the Souls of
men, which he hath ordained the Administrations
of his Gospel to testifie; it cannot be, but that great
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57351:61"/>
thoughts of heart, and no small disorder of mind,
will be occasioned in them, who understand aright
how much the principal end of constituting Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in this world is neglected among them. And
although it is their duty, for a season patiently <hi>to
bear</hi> with, and quietly seek the Reformation of this
Evil in the Churches whereunto they do belong; yet
when they find themselves <hi>excluded,</hi> it may be by
the very Constitution of the Church its self, it may
be by the iniquity of them that prevail therein, from
the performance of any thing that tends thereunto,
it will increase their disquietment. And whereas
men do not joyn themselves; nor are by any other
ways joyned unto Churches, for any <hi>Civil or Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Ends</hi> or Purposes, but meerly for the promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods Glory, and the Edification of their
own Souls in Faith and Gospel-Obedience; it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
vain for any to endeavour a satisfaction of
their Consciences, that it is sin to <hi>withdraw from such
Churches,</hi> wherein these ends are not pursued nor
attainable. And yet a confidence hereof is that
which hath countenanced sundry <hi>Church-Guides</hi>
into that neglect of Duty, which many complain
of, and groan under at this day.</p>
            <p>The second end of the Dispensation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
in the Assemblies of the Churches of Christ by
the Ministers of them, is the <hi>Edification of them that
are converted</hi> unto God, and do believe. Herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
that <hi>feeding of his Sheep and Lambs</hi> that the
Lord Christ hath committed unto them: And it is
mentioned as the principal end for which the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
was ordained; or for which <hi>Pastors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's</hi>
are granted unto the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10, 11,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57351:61"/>
12. And the Scripture abounds in the Declaration
of what skill and knowledge in the <hi>Mystery of the
Gospel,</hi> what Attendance unto the Word and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
what Care, watchfulness and diligent Labour in
the Word and Doctaine, are required unto a due
discharge of the Ministerial Duty. Where it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
or neglected, where it is carelessly attended
unto, where those on whom it is incumbent, to act
more like <hi>Hirelings</hi> than true Shepherds, where
they want skill to <hi>divide the Word aright,</hi> or wisdom
and knowledge to declare from it the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
of God, or diligence to be urgent continually
in the Application of it; there the <hi>principal end</hi> of
all Church-Communion is ruined and utterly lost.
And where it so falls out, let any man judge what
thoughts they are like to be exercised withal, who
make Conscience of the performance of their own
Duty, and understand the necessity of enjoying the
Means that Christ hath appointed for their edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And it is certain, that such Churches will in <hi>vain,</hi>
or at least <hi>unjustly</hi> expect that Professors of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
should abide in their particular communion,
when they cannot or do not provide <hi>food</hi> for their
Souls, whereby they may live to God. Unless all
the Members of such Churches are equally asleep in
security, <hi>Divisions</hi> among them will in this case en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue.
Will any Disciple of Christ esteem himself
obliged to <hi>starve his own Soul,</hi> for the sake of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with them who have sinfully destroyed the
principal end of all Church-communion? Is there
any Law of Christ, or any Rule of the Gospel, or
any Duty of Love, that require them so to do? The
sole immediate end of mens joyning in Churches,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57351:62"/>
being <hi>their own edification,</hi> and usefulness unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
can they be bound in Conscience alwayes to
abide there, or in the communion of those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
where it is not to be attained, where the means
of it are utterly cast aside? This may become such
as know not their duty, nor care to be instructed,
in it, and are <hi>willing to perish</hi> in, and for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of others. But for them which in such Cases
shall provide according to the Rules of the Gospel
for themselves, and their own safety, they may be
censured, judged and severely treated by them
whose Interest and Advantage it is so to do; they
may be despised by <hi>Riotous Persons</hi> who <hi>sport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>
with their own Deceivings; but with the Lord
Christ, the Judge of all, they will be accepted.
And they do but encrease the dread of their own
Account, who under pretence of Church-Power
and Order, would <hi>forcibly shut up Christians</hi> in
such a condition, as wherein they are kept short
of all the true ends of the Institution of Churches.
To suppose therefore that every <hi>voluntary departure</hi>
from the <hi>constant Communion</hi> of such Churches,
made with a design of joyning unto those, where the
Word is dispensed with more diligence and Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
is a <hi>Schisme</hi> from the Church of Christ, is to
suppose that which neither the Scripture, nor Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
will give the least Countenance unto. And it
would better become such Churches to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustriously
unto a faithful <hi>Discharge of their Duty,</hi>
whereby this occasion of Divisions may be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
out of the way, than to attempt their own Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
by the severe prosecution of such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:57351:62"/>
Thirdly, In pursuit of the Doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
so improved and applyed, it is the known and
open Duty of Churches in their Guides or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
by all means to countenance and promote the
<hi>Growth of Light, Knowledge, Godliness, strictness</hi>
and <hi>fruitfulness of Conversation,</hi> in those Members
of them, in whom they may be found, or do appear
in an especial manner: Such are they to own, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage,
and make their companions, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that others may become like unto them. For
unless men in their ordinary and common conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in their affections, and the interest which they
have in the Administration of Discipline, do uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
answer the Doctrine of Truth which they
preach, it cannot be avoided but that it will be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>offence</hi> upto others, and of <hi>Reproach</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Much more will it be so, if instead of these
things, those who <hi>Preside in the Churches,</hi> shall <hi>beat
their fellow servants, and eat and drink with the
drunken.</hi> But by all wayes it is their duty to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the <hi>precious from the vile,</hi> if they intend to be as
the Mouth of the Lord, even in their Judgments,
Affections, and Conversations: And herein what
Wisdome, Patience, Diligence, Love, Condescenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Forbearance are required, they alone know,
and they full well know, who for any season have in
their places conscientiously endeavoured the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of their Duty. But whatever be the <hi>Labour</hi>
which is to be undergone therein, and the trouble
wherewith it is attended, it is that which by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of Christ all Ministers of the Gospel are
obliged to attend unto. They are not by contrary
actings to make <hi>sad the hearts</hi> of them whom God
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57351:63"/>
would not have made sad, nor to <hi>strengthen the
hands</hi> of them whom God would not have encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,
as they will answer it at their peril. The hearts
of <hi>Church Guides,</hi> and of those who in an especial
manner fear God, thriving in Knowledge and
Grace under the Dispensation of the Word, ought
to be <hi>knit together in all holy affections,</hi> that they may
together grow up into him who is the Head. For
where there is the greatest evidence &amp; manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the power and presence of Christ in any, there
ought their Affections to be most intense. For as
such persons are <hi>the Crown,</hi> the Joy and rejoycing
of their Guides, and will appear to be so in the Day
of the Lord; so they do know, or may easily do
so, what Obligations are on them, to honour and
pay all due respects unto their Teachers, how much
on all accounts they owe unto them, whereby their
mutual Love may be confirmed. And where there
is this <hi>Vniformity</hi> between the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
as Preached, and the <hi>Duties</hi> of it as practised,
then are they both beautiful in the eyes of all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and effectual unto their proper ends. But
where things in Churches, through their negligence
or corruption, or that of their <hi>Guides,</hi> are quite
otherwise, it is easie to conjecture what will ensue
thereon. If those who are forwardest in Profession,
who give the greatest evidence that they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the power of that Religion which is taught and
owned among them, who have apparently attained
a <hi>growth</hi> in spirituol Light and Knowledge above
others, shall be so far from being peculiarly cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
and regarded, from being loved, liked, or
associated withal, as that on the other side they shall
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57351:63"/>
be marked, observed, reproached, and it may be
on every slight provocation put even to outward
trouble; whilst men of worldly and prophane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations,
ignorant, perhaps riotous and debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
shall be the delight and companions of Church
<hi>Guides and Rulers,</hi> it cannot be that such Churches
should long continue in peace; nor is that peace
wherein they continue much to be valued. An
Agreement in such wayes and practises, is rather to
be esteemed a <hi>Conspiracy</hi> against Christ and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
than Church Order or Concord. And when
men once find themselves hated, and it may be <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted,</hi>
for no other cause, as they believe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they labour in their Lives and Professions to
express the power of that Truth wherein they have
been instructed, they can hardly avoyd the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of severe thoughts concerning them, from
whom they had just reason to expect other usage;
as also to provide for their own more peaceable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
and edification.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Hereunto also belongeth the due exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of <hi>Gospel Discipline,</hi> according to the mind of
Christ. It is indeed by some called into question,
whether there be any Rule or <hi>Discipline</hi> appointed
by Christ to be exercised in his Churches. But this
doubt must respect, such outward forms and modes
of the Administration of these things, which are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
but not proved necessary. For whether the
Lord Christ hath appointed some to <hi>Rule,</hi> and some
to be <hi>ruled;</hi> whether he hath prescribed <hi>Lawes</hi> or
<hi>Rules,</hi> whereby the One should govern, and the
other obey; whether he hath determined the
<hi>Matter, Manner,</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of this Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57351:64"/>
cannot well be called into Controversie
by such as profess to believe the Gospel. Of what
<hi>nature</hi> or kind these Governours or Rulers are to
be, what is their <hi>Office,</hi> how they are to be invested
therewith, and by what Authority, how they are
to behave themselves in the Administration of the
Laws of the Church, are things determined by him
in the Word. And for the <hi>Matters</hi> about which
they are to be conversant, it is evidently declared
of what nature they are, how they are to be manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
and to what end. The <hi>Qualifications</hi> and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of those who are to be admitted into the
Church, their deportment in it, their removal
from it, are all expressed in the Lawes and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
given unto the same end. In particular it is
ordained, That those who are unruly or disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who walk contrary unto the Rules and wayes
of holiness prescribed unto the Church, shall be
<hi>rebuked, admonished, instructed;</hi> and if after all
means used for their amendment they abide in
impenitency, that they be ejected out of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
For the Church, as visible, is a Society gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and erected to express and declare the <hi>Holiness
of Christ,</hi> and the power of his Grace, in his Person
and Doctrine: And where this is not done, no
Church is of any advantage unto the interests of his
Glory in this World. The Preservation therefore
of <hi>Holiness</hi> in them, whereof the Discipline menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
is an effectual means, is as necessary, and of
the same importance with the preservation of their
Being. The Lord Christ hath also expressly ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
That in case <hi>Offences</hi> should arise in and among
his Churches, that in and by them they should be
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57351:64"/>
composed, according to the Rules of the Word, and
his own Lawes; and in particular, that in sinful
miscarriages causing <hi>offence</hi> or <hi>scandal,</hi> there be a
regular proceeding, according unto an <hi>especial Law</hi>
and Constitution of his, for the removal of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and recovery of the offendor; as also that
those who in other cases have fallen by the power of
temptation, should be restored by a spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and, not to instance in more Particulars, that
the <hi>whole Flock</hi> be continually watched over, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
warned, instructed, comforted, as the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or occasions of the whole, or the several Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it, do require. Now supposing these, and the
like Laws, Rules, and Directions, to be given and
enjoyned by the Authority of Christ (which gives
Warranty for their Execution, unto men prudent
for the ordering of affairs according to their neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
circumstances, and Believers of the Gospel,
doing all things in obedience unto him) we judg
that a compleat <hi>Rule or Government</hi> is erected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
in the Church. However we know that the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of Discipline</hi> in every Church, so far as the Laws
and Rules of it are expressed in the Scripture, and
the Ends of it directed unto, is as necessary as any
Duty enjoyned unto us in the whole course of our
Gospel Obedience. And where this is neglected,
it is in vain for any Churches to expect <hi>Peace and
Vnity</hi> in their Communion, seeing it self neglecteth
the principal means of them. It is pleaded, that the
<hi>mixture of those that are wicked and ungodly</hi> in the
sacred Administrations of the Church, doth neither
defile the Administrations themselves, nor render
them unuseful unto those who are rightly interested
in them, and duly prepared for the participation of
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57351:65"/>
them: Hence that no Church ought to be forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
nor its Communion withdrawn from meerly on
that account, many of <hi>old</hi> and of <hi>late</hi> have pleaded.
Nor do we say, that this solely of its self, is sufficient
to justifie a separation from any Church. But when
a Church shall tolerate in its Communion, not only
<hi>evil men,</hi> but their <hi>evils,</hi> and absolutely refuse to
use the Discipline of Christ for the Reformation of
the One, and the taking away of the other, there is
great danger least the <hi>whole Lump be leavened,</hi> and
the edification of particular persons be obstructed,
beyond what the Lord Christ requires of them to
submit unto, and to acquiesce in.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither will things have any better success where
the</hi> Discipline degenerates into an outward forcible
Jurisdiction and Power. <hi>The things of Christ are to
be administred with the Spirit of Christ. Such a
frame of heart and mind as was in him, is required
of all that</hi> act under him, <hi>and in his Name. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Charity, Pity, Compassion, Condescention,
Meekness and Forbearance, with those other Graces,
which were so glorious and conspicuous in him, and
in all that he did, are to bear sway in the minds of
them who exercise this Care and Duty for him in the
Church. To set up such a</hi> Form of the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Discipline; <hi>or to commit the exercise of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such persons, as whereby, or by whom, the
Lord Christ in his Rule of the Church, would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
as</hi> furious, captious, proud, covetous, <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive,
is not the way to honour him in the
world, nor to preserve the peace of the Churches.
And indeed some while they boast of the Imitation
of Christ and his Example in opposition to his
Grace, do in their Lives and Practises make unco
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57351:65"/>
the world a Representation of the Devil. But an
account of this Degeneracy is given so distinctly by</hi>
Peitro Suave, <hi>the Author of the</hi> History of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of Trent, lib. 4: ad Ann. 1551. that we think it
not unmeet to express it in his own words. He saith
therefore, that, Christ having commanded his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
to preach the Gospel and administer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he left also unto them, in the person of all the
faithful, this principal precept, to love one another,
charging them to make peace between those that dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and for the last Remedy giving the care thereof to
the Body of the Church; promising it should be bound
and loosed in Heaven, whatever they did bind and loose
on earth; and that whatever they did ask with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
consent, should be granted by the Father. In this
charitable office, to give satisfaction to the offended, and
pardon to the offendor, the Primitive Church was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
exercised. And in conformity to this, St. <hi>Paul</hi>
ordained, that brethren having Civil Suits one against
another, should not go to the Tribunals of Infidels; but
that wise men should be appointed to judg the Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
and this was a kind of Civil Judgment, as the other
had the similitude of a Criminal; but were both so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from the Judgments of the world, that as these
are executed by the Power of the Judg who enforceth
submission, so those only by the will of the guilty to
receive them; who refusing of them, the Ecclesiastical
Judge remaineth without execution, and hath no power
but to foreshew the Judgment of God, which according
unto his omnipotent good pleasure will follow in this life
or the next. And indeed the Ecclesiastical Judgment
did deserve the name of Charity, in regard that it did
only induee the guilty to submit, and the Church to judg
with such sincerity, that neither in the one any bad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57351:66"/>
could have place, nor just complaint in the other;
and the excess of charity in correcting, did make the
Corrector to feel greater pain than the corrected; so
that in the Church no punishment was imposed, without
lamentation of the multitude, and greater of the better
sort. And this was the cause why to <hi>correct</hi> was called
to <hi>Lament.</hi> So St. <hi>Paul</hi> rebuking of the <hi>Corinchians,</hi>
for not chastising the incestuous, said, you have not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
to separate such a Transgressor from you. And
in another Epistle, <hi>I fear that when I come unto you,
I shall not find you such as I desire, but in contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and tumults, and that at my coming I shall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
many of those who have sinned before.</hi> The
Judgment of the Church (as it is necessary in every
multitude) was fit that it should be conducted by one,
who should preside and guide the action, propose the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and collect the poynts to be consulted on. This care
due to the most principal and worthy psrson, was alwayes
committed to the Bishop: And when the Churches were
many, the propositions and deliberations were made by
the <hi>Bishop,</hi> first in the Colledge of the Priests and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,
which they called the Presbitery, and there were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
to receive afterwards the last resolution in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Congregation of the Church. This form was still
on foot in the year 250, and is plainly seen by the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who in the matter concerning those who
did eat of meats offered to Idols, and subscribe to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of the Gentiles, writeth to the Presbitery, that he
doth not think to do any thing without their counsel, &amp;
consent of the people, &amp; writeth to the people, that at his
return he will examine the causes and merits thereof in
their presence, and under their judgment; and he wrote
to those Priests, who of their own brain had reconciled
some, that they should give an account to the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:57351:66"/>
The Goodness and Charity of the Bishops
made their Opinion for the most part to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and by little and little, was cause, that
the Church, Charity waxing cold, not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Charge laid upon them by Christ, did
lean the ear to the Bishop; and Ambition, a
witty Passion, which doth insinuate it self in
the shew of Virtue, did cause it to be readily
embraced. But the principal cause of the change
was the ceasing of the Persecutions: For
then the Bishops did erect, as it were a Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
which was much frequented; because as
Temporal Commodities, so Suits did encrease.
This Judgment, though it were not as the former,
in regard of the Form, to determine all by the
Opinion of the Church, yet it was of the same
Sincerity. Whereupon <hi>Constantine</hi> seeing
how profitable it was to determine Causes, and
that by the Authority of Religion, captious
actions were discovered, which the Jadges could
not penetrate, made a Law that there should
lie no Appeal from the Sentences of Bishops,
which should be executed by the Secular Judge.
And if, in a Cause depending before a Secular
Tribunal, in any state thereof, either of the
Parties, though the other contradict, shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the Episcopal Judgment, the Cause shall
be immediately remitted to him. Here the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal
of the Bishop began to be a common
Pleading Place, having Execution by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
of the Magistrate, and to gain the
name of Episcopal Jurisdiction, Episcopal
Audience, and such like. The Emperor <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:57351:67"/>
did enlarge it; who, in the Year 365.
gave the Bishop the care over all the Prizes of
vendible things: This Judicial Negotiation
pleased not the good Bishops. <hi>Possidonius</hi>
doth recount, that <hi>Austin,</hi> being employed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
sometimes until Dinner-time, sometimes
longer, was wont to say, that it was a trouble,
and did divert him from doing things proper
unto him; and himself writeth, that it was to
leave things profitable, and to attend things
tumultuous and perplexed. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> did
not take it unto himself, as being not fit for a
Preacher; but would have it given to others.
Afterwards, some Bishops beginning to abuse
the Authority given them by the Law of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
that was seventy years after, revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
by <hi>Horcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius;</hi> and an
Ordination made, that they should judge Causes
of Religion, and not Civil, except both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
did consent, and declared that they should
not be thought to have a Court: Which Law
being not much observed in <hi>Rome,</hi> in regard of
the great power of the Bishops, <hi>Valentinian</hi>
being in the City in the year 452. did renew
it, and made it to be put in execution. But a
little after, some part of the Power taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
was restored by the Princes that followed;
so that <hi>Justinian</hi> did establish unto them a
Court and Audience, and assigned unto them
the Causes of Religion, the Ecclesiastical
Faults of the Clergy, and divers voluntary
Jurisdictions also over the Laity. By these
Degrees, the charitable correction of Christ,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57351:67"/>
did degenerate into Domination, and made
Christians lose their ancient Reverence and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
It is denied in words, That Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Jurisdiction is Dominion; as is the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;
yet one knoweth not how to put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between them. But <hi>St. Paul</hi> did put it,
when he wrote to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and repeated it to
<hi>Titus,</hi> that a Bishop should not be greedy of
gain, nor a Striker. Now on the contrary, they
made men pay for Processes, and imprison the
Parties, as is done in the Secular Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Degeneracy of Discipline</hi> was long
since esteemed burdensome, and looked on
as the cause of innumerable troubles and
grievances unto all sorts of people: Yea, it
hath had no <hi>better esteem</hi> among them who
had little or no acquaintance with what is
taught concerning these things in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
Only they found an <hi>Inconsistency in it</hi>
with those Laws and Priviledges of their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Countries, whereby their <hi>Civil Liberties</hi>
and Advantages were confirmed unto them.
And if at any time it take place or prevail
amongst Persons of more Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
who are able to compare it, or the
practice of it, with the <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>stitutions of Christ
in the Gospel,</hi> and the manner of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
therein also directed, it greatly ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enates
the minds of men from the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of such Churches. Especially it doth so,
if set up unto an <hi>exclusion</hi> of that <hi>benigne,</hi>
kind, spiritual, and every way useful Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
that Christ hath appointed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57351:68"/>
in his Church. When Corruptions
and Abuses were come to the height in the
<hi>Papacy</hi> in this matter, we know what ensued
thereon. <hi>Divines indeed,</hi> and sundry other
Persons Learned and Godly, did principally
insist on the Errors and <hi>Heresies</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
in the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome, with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements
and Abominations of their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
But that which alienated the minds of
<hi>Princes, Magistrates,</hi> and whole Nations
from them, was the <hi>Ecclesiastical Domination</hi>
which they had craftily erectsd, and cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mannaged unto the ends of their own Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
Power and Avarice, under the name
of Church-Rule and Discipline. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
any thing of the <hi>same kind</hi> is continued,
that a Rule under the same Pretence is erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and exercised in any Church, after the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Secular Courts,</hi> by force and power,
put forth in <hi>Legal Citations,</hi> Penalties, Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary
Mulcts, without an open evidence of
mens being acted in what they do herein, by
<hi>Love,</hi> Charity, Compassion towards the
Souls of men, <hi>Zeel</hi> for the Glory of God,
and Honour of Christ, with a Design for
the Purity, Holiness and Reformation of the
Members of it, that Church may not expect
Unity and Peace any longer than the terrour
of its Proceedings doth over-ballance other
Thoughts and Desires proceeding from a
sense of Duty in all that belong unto it. Yea,
whatever is, or is to be the manner of the
<hi>Administration of Discipline</hi> in the Church,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57351:68"/>
about which there may be doubtful Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which men of an ordinary capacity
may not be able clearly to determine; yet if
the <hi>avowed end</hi> of it be not the Purity and
Holiness of the Church, and if the <hi>Effects</hi>
of it in a tendency unto that End be not
manifest, it is hard to find out whence our
Obligation to a compliance with it, should
arise. And where an outward Conformity
unto some Church-Order is aimed at alone,
in the room of all other things, it will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prove it self to be nothing, or of no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
in the sight of Christ. And these things
do <hi>alienate</hi> the minds of many from an acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>escencie
in their Stations, or Relations to
such Churches. For the principal Enforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of mens Obedience and Reverence un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Rulers of the Church, is because they
<hi>watch diligently for the good of their Souls,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 27.</note> 
               <hi>as
those that must give an Account.</hi> And if they
see such set over them as give no evidence of
any such <hi>watchful Care</hi> acting its self accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to those Scripture-Directions which are
continually read unto them; but rather rule
them with force and rigour, <hi>seeking theirs,
not them,</hi> they grow weary of the Yoke, and
sometimes regularly, sometimes irregularly,
contrive their own Freedom and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>It may not here be amiss to enquire into
the <hi>Reasons and Occasions</hi> that have seduced
Churches and their Rulers into the Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
insisted on. Now these are chiefly some
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57351:69"/>
               <hi>Principles</hi> with their Application that they
have trusted unto; but which indeed have
really deceived them, and will yet continue
so to do. And the first of these is, that
whereas <hi>they are true Churches, and thereon
intrusted with all Church-Power and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
they need not further concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to seek, for Grounds or Warranty to keep
up all their Members unto their Communion.</hi>
For be they otherwise what they will, so
long as they are <hi>True Churches,</hi> it is their
duty to abide in their Peace and Order. If
any call their <hi>Church-state</hi> into question,
they take no consideration of them, but how
they may be <hi>punished;</hi> it may be, destroyed,
as perverse <hi>Schismaticks.</hi> And they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to suppose that upon an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that they are <hi>True Churches,</hi> every dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from them in any thing, must needs be
criminal: As if it were all one to be a <hi>True
Church,</hi> and to be in the <hi>Truth and Right</hi> in
all things; a supposition whereof, includes
a <hi>Nullity</hi> in the state of those Churches
which in the least differ from them; than
which, there is no more uncharitable, nor
<hi>Schismatical</hi> Principle in the world: But in
the common Definition of Schism, that it is
a <hi>causeless Separation from a true Church;</hi>
that term of <hi>causless,</hi> is very little consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or weighed, by them whose Interest it is,
to lay the Charge of it on others. And
hence it is come to pass, that where-ever
there have been complaints of Faults, Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57351:69"/>
Errors, Defections of Churches,
in late Ages their <hi>Counsels</hi> have only been
how to <hi>destroy the Complainers,</hi> not in the
least how they should reform themselves; as
though in Church-Affairs, Truth, Right and
Equity, were entailed on Power and Posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
How the Complaints concerning the
<hi>Church of Rome,</hi> quickned by the Outcries
of so many <hi>Provinces of</hi> Europe, and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in matter of Fact, were eluded and
frustrated in the <hi>Councel of</hi> Trent, leaving all
tfiings to be tried out by Interest and force,
is full well known. For they know that no
<hi>Reformation</hi> can be attempted and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished,
but it will be a business of great
Labour, Care and Trouble, things not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
unto the minds of men at ease. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
as it may possibly ruffle or discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
some of the <hi>Chiefs</hi> in their present
ways or enjoyments; so it will as they fear,
tend to their Disreputation; as though they
had formerly been out of the way, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective
of their Duty: And this, as they
suppose, would draw after it another <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,</hi>
by reflecting on them and their
Practices, as the Occasions of former Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
and Divisions, They chuse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
generally to flatter themselves under the
Name and Authority of the Church, and
lay up their Defence and Security against
an humble painful <hi>Reformation,</hi> in a Plea
that they need it not. So was it with the
Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> of old, who in the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57351:70"/>
height of her decaying condition,<note place="margin">Rev. 3. 17.</note> flattered
her self, <hi>That she was rich, and encreased in
Goods, and had need of nothing; and knew not,</hi>
or would not acknowledge, <hi>that she was wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and miserable, and poor, and blind, and
naked.</hi> Now it cannot but seem exceeding
strange unto men who wisely consider these
things, that whereas the Churches which
were <hi>planted and watered by the Apostles</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and enjoyed for some good season the
presence and advantage of their infallible
Guidance to preserve them in their original
purity and order, did within a few years,
many of them, so degenerate, and stand in
need of Reformation, that our Lord Jesus
Christ threatned from Heaven to cast them
off and destroy them, unless they did spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
reform themselves according to his
mind; that those now in the world, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at first by persons fallible, and who in
many things were actually deceived, should
so continue in their purity and holiness,
from Age to Age, as to stand in need of no
Reformation or Amendment. Well will it
be, if it prove so at the great Day of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitation.
In the mean time it becomes the
Guides of all the Churches in the world,
to take care that there do not such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays
of Truth, Holiness and Purity in
Worship, fall out <hi>under their hand</hi> in the
Churches wherein they preside, as that for
them they should be rejected by our Lord
Jesus Christ; as he threatens to deal with
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57351:70"/>
those who are guilty of such defections. For
the state of the <hi>Generality of Churches</hi> is such
at this day in the world, as he who thinks
them not to stand in need of any <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
may justly be looked on as a part of
their sinful Degeneracy. We are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
what is usually pleaded in Barr un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all endeavours after Church-Reformation:
For, they say, if upon the Clamours of a
<hi>few humorous, discontented Persons,</hi> whom
nothing will please, and who, perhaps are
not agreed among themselves, a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
must instantly be made or attempted,
there will be nothing stable, firm or sacred
left in the Church. Things <hi>once well esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished,</hi>
are not to be called into question
upon every ones Exceptions. And these
things are vehemently pleaded, and urged
to the exclusion of all thoughts of changing
any thing, though evidently for the better.
But <hi>long continued complaints,</hi> and Petitions
of Multitudes, whose Sincerity hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as great an attestation as Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or Christian Religion can give, it may
be deserve not to be so despised: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the <hi>Jealousie</hi> which Churches and their
Rulers ought to have over themselves, their
state and condition, and the presence of
the Glory of Christ amongst them, or its
departure from them, especially consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fearful example of the Defection
and Apostacy of many Churches, which is
continually before their Eyes, seems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57351:71"/>
a readiness in them on every Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Remembrance, to search into their
state and condition, and to redress what they
find amiss: For suppose they should be in
the <hi>Right,</hi> and blameless as to those Orders
and Constitutions, wherein others dissent from
them; yet there may be such Defects and
Declensions, in Doctrine, Holiness, and
the Fruits of them in the world, as the
most strict observation of outward Order
will neither countenance, nor compensate:
For to think to preserve a Church by
<hi>Outward Order,</hi> when its internal Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of Faith and Holiness are decayed, is
but to do like him, who endeavouring to
set a <hi>Dead Body upright,</hi> but failing in his
Attempt, concluded, that there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
wanting within.</p>
            <p>Another Principle of the same importance,
and applied unto the same purpose, is, that
the <hi>people are neither able, nor fit to judge for
themselves,</hi> but ought in all things to give
themselves up unto the conduct of their
Guides, and to rest satisfied in what they
purpose and prescribe unto them. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibing
of this <hi>Apprehension,</hi> which is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
well suited to be made a Covering to
the Pride and Ignorance of those unto whose
Interests it is accommodated, makes them
impatient of hearing any thing, concerning
the Liberty of Christians in common, to
judge of what is their Duty, what they
are to do, and what they are not to do in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57351:71"/>
things Sacred and Religious. Only it is
acknowledged, there is so much <hi>Ingenuity</hi>
in the management of this Principle and its
Application, that it is seldom extended by
any beyond their own Concernments: For
whereas the <hi>Church of</hi> Rome hath no way
to maintain its self in its <hi>Doctrine</hi> and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Parts of its Constitution, but by an
implicit Faith and Obedience in its <hi>Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ects:</hi>
seeing the animating Principles of its Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
will endure no kind of impartial Test
or Trial, they extend it unto <hi>all things</hi> as
well in Matters of Faith, as of Worship
and Discipline. But those who are secure,
that the <hi>Faith</hi> which they profess will endure
an examination by the Scripture, as being
founded therein, and thence educed, they
will allow unto the people, at least a <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of discerning Truth</hi> from Falshood, to
be exercised about the Doctrines which they
teach: But as for the things which concern
the <hi>Worship of God,</hi> and Rule of the Church,
wherein they have an especial Interest and
Concern, there they betake themselves for
relief unto this Principle. Now as there
is more <hi>Honesty</hi> and Safety in this latter way
than in the former; so it cannot be denied,
but that there is less of <hi>ingenuity</hi> and self-consistency:
For if you will allow the
people to make a judgment in and about <hi>any
thing</hi> that is Sacred or Religious, you will never
know how to hit a Joint aright, to make a
separation among such things; so as to say
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57351:72"/>
with any pretence of Reason, about these
things they may judge for themselves, but
not about those. And it is a little too <hi>open</hi>
to say, that they may exercise a Judgment
about what God hath appointed, but none
about what we appoint our selves. But
without offence be it spoken, this <hi>Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
in its whole Latitude, and under its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strictions,
is so weak and ridiculous, that it
must be thought to proceed from an excess of
prejudice, if any man of Learning should
undertake to patronize it. Those who speak
in these things out of <hi>Custom and Interest,</hi>
without a due examination of the Grounds
and Reasons of what they affirm or deny, as
many do, are of no consideration: And it
is not amiss for them to <hi>keep their distance,</hi>
and stand upon their Guard, lest many of
those whom they exclude from judging for
themselves, should be found more compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ent
Judges in those Matters than themselves.
And let Churches and Church-Rulers do
what they please, every man at last will be
<hi>determined</hi> in what is meet for him to do,
by his own Reason and Judgment. Churches
may inform the minds of men, they cannot
enforce them. And if those that adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any Church, do not do so, because they
judge that it is their duty, and best for
them so to do, they therein differ not much
from an Herd of Creatures, that are called
by another name. And yet a secret Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
in some, that the <hi>Disposal</hi> of the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57351:72"/>
Concernments of the Worship of God, is so
left and confined unto themselves, as that
nothing is left unto the people but the Glory
of Obedience, without any sedulous enquiry
after what is their own duty, with respect
unto that account which every one must give
of himself unto God, doth greatly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
them into the neglects insisted on. And
when any of the people come to know their
own <hi>Liberty and Duty</hi> in these things, as
they cannot but know it, if at all they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
their minds unto the consideration of
them, they are ready to be alienated from
those who will neither permit them to judge
for themselves, nor are able to answer for
them, if they should be misled. For if the
<hi>blind lead the blind,</hi> as well he <hi>that is led, as
he that leads, will into the Ditch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Add hereunto the thoughts of some,
that <hi>Secular Grandeur,</hi> and outward Pomp,
with a Distance and Reservedness from the
Conversation of ordinary men, are necessary
in <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi> to raise and preserve that
popular veneration, which they suppose to
be their due. Without this it is thought
<hi>Government</hi> will not be carried on, nor the
minds of men awed unto Obedience. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is that this was not the Judgment of
the <hi>Apostles</hi> of old, nor of the Bishops or
Pastors of the Primitive Churches. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
also, that no <hi>Direction</hi> is given for it,
in any of the Sacred, or ancient Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Writings. And yet they all of them
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57351:73"/>
abound with Instructions how the <hi>Guides</hi> of
the Church should preserve that respect
which is their due. The sum of what they
teach us to this purpose is,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3.</note> Readiness to take
up the Cross,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 18, 19, 20, 21, 31.</note> in Labours, Kindness, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
and Zeal in the exercise of all the
Gifts and Graces of the Holy Spirit, they
should excel and go before the Flock as their
Example. This way of procuring venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto Church Guides by <hi>worldly State,</hi>
Greatness, seeming Domination or Power,
was, as far as we can find, an utter stranger
unto the primitive times: Yea, not only so,
but it seems to be expressly prohibited,<note place="margin">Lnk. 22. 24, 25. 26.</note> in
that Direction of our Saviour unto them,
for avoiding Conformity in these things unto
the Rulers of the world. But those times
they say are past and gone: There remains
not that piety and <hi>Devotion</hi> in Christians, as
to reverence their Pastors, for their Humility,
Graces, Labours and Gifts. The good
things of this world are now given them to
be used; and it is but a <hi>Popular Levelling
Spirit</hi> that envies the Dignities and Exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Clergy. Be it so therefore, that
in any place they are justly and usefully, at
least as unto themselves, possessed of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and Revenues; and far be it from us, or
any of us to <hi>envy</hi> them their Enjoyments;
or to endeavour their deprivation of them:
But we must crave leave to say, that the use
of them to the <hi>End</hi> mentioned is vain; and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57351:73"/>
wholly frustrate. And if it be so indeed,
that Christians, or professors of the Gospel,
will not pay the <hi>Respect and Duty</hi> which
they owe unto their Pastors and Guides upon
the account of their Office, with their work
and labour therein, it is an open evidence
how great a necessity there is for all men to
endeavour the reduction of primitive Light,
Truth, Holiness and Obedience into Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
For this is that which hath endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
their Ruine, and will effect it, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued;
namely, an <hi>Accommodation</hi> of Church-Order
and Discipline, with the State and
Deportment of Rulers, unto the Decayes
and Irreligion of the people, which should
have been corrected and removed by their
Reformation: But we hope better things of
many Christians, whose Faith and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
are rather to be imitated, than the <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
Degeneracy</hi> of others to be complied
with, or provided for. However, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that this corrupt perswasion hath in most
Ages, since the days of <hi>Paulus Samosatenus,</hi>
let out and given countenance unto the
Pride, Covetousness, Ambition and Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory
of several <hi>Ecclesiasticks.</hi> For how can
it be otherwise with them, who being pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
of the <hi>Secular Advantages</hi> which
some Churches have obtained in the world,
are otherwise utterly destitute of those Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications,
which tue Names of the places
they possess, do require. And yet all this
while it will be impossible to give <hi>one single
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57351:74"/>
Instance,</hi> where that Respect and Estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the Scripture tequires in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
towards their Spiritual Guides, were
ever ingenerated or improved by that world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Grandeur,</hi> Pomp and Domination, which
some pretend to be so useful unto that end
and purpose: For that <hi>Awe</hi> which is put
thereby on the Spirits of the common fort
of men; that <hi>Terror</hi> which these things
strike into the minds of any who may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
unto Trouble and Disadvantage from
them; that <hi>outward Observance</hi> which is by
some done unto persons vested with them,
with the <hi>Admission</hi> which they have thereby
into an equality of Society with great men
in the world, are things quite of another
Nature. And those who satisfie and please
themselves herewith, instead of that <hi>Regard</hi>
which is due unto the Officers or Guides
of the Churches of Christ, from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that belong unto them, do but help on
their <hi>Defection</hi> from their Duty incumbent
on them. Neither were it difficult to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
what innumerable scandalous offences,
proceeding from the <hi>Pride</hi> and Elation of
Mind that is found among many, who being
perhaps <hi>Young</hi> and <hi>Ignorant,</hi> it may be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
in their Conversations, having nothing
to bear up themselves withal, but an Interest
in <hi>Dignities</hi> and worldly Riches, have been
occasioned by this corrupt Perswasion. And
it is not hard to judge how much is lost here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
from the true <hi>Glory</hi> and Beauty of the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57351:74"/>
Church. The people are quietly suffered to
decay in that Love and Respect towards their
Pastors, which is their Grace and Duty,
whilst they will pay that outward Veneration
which worldly Grandeur doth acquire; and
Pastors satisfying themselves therewith, grow
neglective of that exemplary Humility and
Holiness, of that Laborious Diligence in the
dispensation of the Word, and care for the
Soules of the Flock, which should procure
them that <hi>Holy Respect</hi> which is due unto
their Office by the Appointment of Jesus
Christ. But these things are here mention'd
only on the occasion of what was before
discoursed of.</p>
            <p>Another great Occasion of <hi>Schismes and
Divisions</hi> among Christians, ariseth from the
Remainders of that Confusion which was
brought upon the Churches of <hi>Europe,</hi> by
that general <hi>Apostacy</hi> from Gospel-Truth,
Purity, and Order, whereiu they were for
sundry Ages involved: Few Churches in
the world have yet totally freed themselves
from being influenced by the <hi>Relicks</hi> of its
Disorders: That such an <hi>Apostacy</hi> did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
these Churches, we shall not need to prove.
A supposition of it, is the foundation of the
present Church-state of <hi>England.</hi> That
things should so fall out among them, was
of old foretold by the Holy Ghost.<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2.</note> That
many Churches have received a signal Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from the principal <hi>Evils</hi> of that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasie</hi>
in the Reformation, we all acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57351:75"/>
For therein by several ways, and in
several degrees of success, a return unto
their pristine Faith and Order was sincerely
endeavoured. And so far was there a Blessing
accompanying of their endeavours, as that
they were all of them delivered from things
in themselves <hi>pernitious</hi> and destructive to the
Souls of men. Nevertheless it cannot be
denied, but that there do yet continue among
them sundry <hi>Remainders</hi> of those Disorders,
which under their fatal Declension they were
cast into. Nor doth there need any further
proof hereof, than the <hi>incurable Differences</hi>
and Divisions that are found among them:
For had they all attained their primitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
such Divisions with all their Causes
had been prevented. And the Papists, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding
Protestants with their intestine Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
and Schismes, do but reproach them
that they have not been able in an <hi>hundred
years</hi> to rectifie all those Abuses, and remove
all those Disorders, which they were invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and did introduce in a thousand. There
is one thing only of this Nature, or that
owes it self unto this Original, which we
shall instance in, as an occasion of much Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
in the present Churches, and of great
Divisions that ensue thereon. It is known,
none were admitted unto the fellowship of
the Church in the Dayes of the Apostles,
but upon their Repentance, Faith, and
turning unto God. The plain Story of their
Preaching, the Success which they had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57351:75"/>
and their Proceedings to gather and plant
Churches thereon, puts this out of the reach
of all sober Contradiction. None will say,
that they gathered Churches of <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> that is, whilst they continued such,
nor of <hi>open Sinners,</hi> continuing to live in
their sins. An evidence therefore, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
of Conversion to God, was unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
necessary to the Admission of Members
in the first Churches. Neither will we ever
contend with such importune Prejudices, as,
under any pretences capable of a wrangling
Countenance, shall set up against this evidence.
Hence, in the <hi>judgment of Charity,</hi> all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of those Churches, were looked on as
persons <hi>really justified</hi> and sanctified, as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
converted unto God; and as such,
were they saluted and treated by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles:
As such, we say they were looked
on and owned; and as such, upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
it was the duty of all men, even of
the Apostles themselves, to look on them,
and own them; though absolutely in the
sight of God, who alone is the <hi>Searcher of
the hearts of men,</hi> some among them were
<hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and some proved Apostates. But
this Profession of Conversion unto God, by
the Ministry of the Word, and the mutual
acknowledgment of each other as so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
unto God in a way of Duty, was the
foundation of holy <hi>spiritual Love</hi> and U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
among them. And although this did
not, nor could preserve all the first Churches
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57351:76" rendition="simple:additions"/>
absolutely free from <hi>Schismes and Divisions,</hi>
yet was it the most Soveraign Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that Infection, and the most effectual
means for the reduction of Unity, after that
by the violent interposition of mens Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Temptations, it had been lost for a
season. Afterwards in the <hi>Primitive times,</hi>
when many more took on them the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christian Religion, who had not such
eminent and visible Conversions unto God,
as most of those had who were changed by
the Ministry of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
and unqualified for that state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of being Members of Churches, might
not be admitted into them, unto the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of their Order, and disreputation of
their Holy Conversation, they were for some
good season kept in the condition of <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctants,</hi>
and called <hi>Catechumens,</hi> or persons
that attended the Church for Instruction. In
this state they were taught the Mysteries of
Religion, and trial was made of their <hi>Faith,
Holiness,</hi> and Constancy, before their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission:
And by this means was the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of the Churches in Purity, Peace, and
Order, provided for: Especially were they
so in conjunction with that <hi>severe Discipline</hi>
which was then exercised towards all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of them. But after that the Multitudes
of the <hi>Gentile world,</hi> in the times of the first
Christian Emperors, pressed into the Church,
and were admitted on much easier terms than
those before mentioned, whole Nations came
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57351:76"/>
to claim successively the priviledge of <hi>Church-Membership,</hi>
without any personal duty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
or profession made unto that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
on their part. And so do they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
to do in many places to this day. Men
generally trouble themselves no farther about
a <hi>Title</hi> to Church-Membership and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
but rest in the prepossession of their
Ancestors, and their own Nativity in such or
such places: For whatever may be owned or
acknowledged concerning the necessity of a
<hi>visible Profession</hi> of Faith and Repentance,
and that <hi>credible</hi> as to the sincerity of it in the
judgment of Charity, it is certain for the
most part, no such thing is required of any,
nor performed by them. And they do but ill
consult for the edification of the Church, or
the good of the Souls of men, who would teach
them to rest in an <hi>outward formal Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of things, instead of the reality of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the power of Internal Grace. And
no small part of the present ruine of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Religion owes it self unto this <hi>corrupt
Principle.</hi> For whereas the things of it
which consist in <hi>Powers Internal,</hi> and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Operations of Grace, have out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Representations of them, which
from their Relation unto what they repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
are called by the same names with
them, many take up with, and rest in
these external things, as though Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
consisted in them; although they are
but a <hi>dead Carcass,</hi> where the quickning life
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57351:77" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Soul of internal Grace is wanting. Thus
it is in this matter, where there is a shadow
and appearance of <hi>Church-Order,</hi> when the
truth and substance of it is far away. Men
come together unto all the Ends of Church-Assemblies
where unto they are admitted, but
on no other grounds, with no other hearts,
nor designes, but on and with what they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in any <hi>Civil Society,</hi> or joyntly engage
in any other worldly Concern. And this
Fundamental Errour in the Constitution of
many Churches, is the occasion as of other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
so in particular of <hi>Divisions</hi> among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
Christians. Hence originally was the
<hi>Discipline of the Church</hi> accommodated by
various degrees to the Rule and Government
of such persons, as understood little, or
were little sensible of the Nature, Power,
and Efficacy of that spiritual Discipline
which is instituted in the Gospel, which
thereby at last degenerated into the outward
way of Force and Power before described:
For the Churches began to be composed of
such as could no otherwise be ruled. And
instead of reducing them to their <hi>Primitive
Temper</hi> and Condition where unto the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
Rule was suited, there was invented a
way of Government accommodate unto that
state whereinto they were lapsed, which
those concerned found to be the far <hi>easier work</hi>
of the two. Hence did sincere <hi>mutual Love</hi>
with all the fruits of it begin to decay among
Church-Members; seeing they could not
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57351:77"/>
have that tollerable perswasion of that Truth
of Profession in each other which is necessary
to preserve it <hi>without Dissimulation,</hi> and to
provoke it unto a due Exercise. Hence did
<hi>private spiritual Communion</hi> fail amongst
them, the most being strangers unto all the
ways and means of it; yea despising and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
it in all the instances of its exercise;
which will yet be found to be as the Life and
Soul of all useful Church-communion. And
where publick Communion is only attended
unto with a neglect hereof, it will quickly
wither and come to nothing: For on this
occasion do all duties of <hi>Watchfulness, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations</hi>
and <hi>Admonitions,</hi> proceeding from
mutual Love and Care of each others condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
so frequently recommended unto us in
the Scripture, utterly cease and become dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used.
Hence Members of the same Church
began to converse together as men only, or
at the best <hi>Civil Neighbours;</hi> and if at all as
Christians, yet not with respect unto that
especial relation unto a particular Church,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</note> wherein their usefulness as <hi>Members</hi> of the
same <hi>Organical Body</hi> is required. Hence
some persons looking on these things as <hi>intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable,</hi>
and not only obstructive of their Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
but destructive unto all really useful
Church-Communion, we ought not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
if they have thought meet to provide
otherwise for themselves. Not that we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of <hi>every departure</hi> or withdrawing
from the Communion of Churches, where
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57351:78"/>
things continue under such disorders, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
shew what it is that occasioneth many so
to do. For as there may sometimes be <hi>just
cause</hi> hereof, and persons in so doing may
mannage what they do according unto
Scripture-Rule; so we doubt not but that
some may <hi>rashly and precipitately,</hi> without
due attendance unto all the Duties which in
such Undertakings are required of them,
without that Charity and Forbearance which
no Circumstances can absolve them from,
make themselves guilty of a blameable sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
And these are some of those things
which we look upon as the <hi>General Causes</hi> or
Occasions of all the <hi>Schismes and Divisions</hi>
that are at this day found among Professors
of the Gospel. Whether the guilt of them
will not much cleave unto them by whom
they are kept on foot and maintained, is worth
your enquiry, For so doth it befall our <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature,</hi> apt to be deceived and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on by various Pretences and Prejudices,
that those are oftentimes highly <hi>guilty them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>
of those miscarriages, whose chiefest
satisfaction and glory consists in charging
them on others. However if these things
do not absolutely justifie any in a <hi>Secession</hi>
from the Churches where unto they did relate;
yet they render the matter so highly questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable,
and the things themselves are so bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome
unto the minds of many, as that
<hi>Divisions</hi> will thereon undoubtedly ensue.
And when it is so fallen out, to design and
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57351:78" rendition="simple:additions"/>
contrive the reduction of all unto <hi>outward
Vnity and Concord,</hi> by forcing them, who on
such occasions have dissented and withdrawn
themselves from the Communion of any
Church, without endeavouring the <hi>removal</hi>
of these Occasions of their so doing, and
the <hi>Reformation</hi> of those abuses which have
given cause thereunto, is severe, if not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just.
But when the Lord Jesus Christ in his
Care towards his Churches, and watchfulness
over them, shall be pleased to <hi>remove</hi> these
and the like stumbling-Blocks out of the way,
there will, we hope, be a full return unto
Gospel-Unity and Peace among them that
serve and worship him on the Earth.</p>
            <p>In this state of things, where-ever it be
found, it is no wonder if the <hi>Weaknesses, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
Prejudices</hi> and Temptations of men do
interpose themselves unto the encrease and
heightning of those Divisions, whose Springs
and Occasions lye elswhere. When none of
these <hi>Provocations</hi> were given them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 11.</note> yet we
know there was enough in Professors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to bring forth the bitter fruit of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
and <hi>Schisms,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 3. 3.</note> even in the dayes of the
Apostles. How much more may we fear the
like fruits and effects from the like <hi>Principles</hi>
and corrupt affections? Now the Occasions of
drawing them forth are more, Temptations
unto them greater, Directions against them
less evident and powerful; and all sense of
<hi>Ecclesiastical Authority,</hi> through its abuse and
male-administration, is, if not lost and ruined,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57351:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yet much weakned and impaired. But from
the darkness of the minds of men, and their
<hi>unmortified affections,</hi> (as the best know but
in part, nor are they perfectly sanctified) it
is, that they are apt to <hi>take offence</hi> one at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and thereon to judge and censure each
other temerariously; and which is worst of
all, every one to make his own understanding
and perswasion thereon, the Rule of Truth
and Worship unto others. All such wayes
and courses are <hi>against us</hi> in the matter of
Love and Union, all tending to make and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
Divisions among us. And the <hi>Evil</hi> that
is in them, we might here declare, but that it
falls frequently under the chastisement of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hands: Neither indeed can it well meet
with too much severity of reproof. Only it
were desireable that those by whom such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs
are mannaged, would take care not to
give <hi>advantages of Retortion</hi> or self-justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto them that are reproved by them:
But this they do unavoydably, whilst they
seem to make their own Judgments and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
the sole Rule and measure of what they
approve or disallow. In what <hi>complyes with
them</hi> there is nothing perverse, and in what
differs from them there is nothing sincere.
And on this foundation whilst they reprove,
<hi>censuring,</hi> rash-judging and reproaching of
others, with pride, self-conceitedness, false O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
irregular practices in Church wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
or any other concerns of Religion, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting,
easiness in taking up false reports
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57351:79"/>
with the like <hi>evils,</hi> as they deserve severely to
be rebuked, those reproved by them are apt
to think, that they see the guilt of many of the
crimes charged on themselves, in them by
whom they are reproved. So on all hands
things <hi>gendor unto farther strife;</hi> whilst every
Party being conscious unto their own <hi>sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
according unto the Rule of their present
Light, which is the only measure they can
take of it, are ready to impeach the sincerity
of them by whom they suppose themselves
causlesly traduced and condemned. This evil
therefore is to be diligently watched against
by all that love Unity, Truth, Holiness, or
Peace. And seeing there are Rules and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
given us in the Scripture to this purpose,
it may not be unmeet to call over some of
them. One Rule of this nature and import, is
that <hi>we should all of us study to be quiet, and to
do our own business,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 11.</note> in things Civil and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred.
Who will harm men, who will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with them, whilst they are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
busied in the world? And if any attempt
to do them evil, what need have they to be
troubled thereat? <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Innocency</hi> will
give peace to a worthy soul in the midst of all
storms, and whatever may befall it. Now will
any one deny, or can they, but that it is the
duty, and ought to be the business of every
man to seek his own <hi>edification,</hi> and the saving
of his soul? Deny this unto any man, and you
put your self in the place of God to him, and
make him more miserable than a Beast. And
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57351:80"/>
this, which no man can forbid, no man can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
do, than according to that <hi>Light</hi> and
<hi>knowledg of the will of God</hi> which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived:
If this therefore be so attended to, as
that we do not thereby break in upon the
concerns of others, nor disturb them in what
is theirs, but be carryed on <hi>quietly</hi> and <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably</hi>
with an evidence in what we do, that it
is meerly our own personal duty, that we are
in the pursuance of; all cause of offence will
be taken away. For if any will yet be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with men, because they peaceably seek
the <hi>savation of their own souls,</hi> or do that in
order thereunto, which they cannot but do,
unless they will cast off all sense of Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over them, it is to seek occasion of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against them, where none are given.
But when any persons are acted by a <hi>Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Curiosity</hi> to interpose themselves in the
Wayes, Affairs, and Concerns of other men,
beyond what the Laws of Love, usefulness, and
mutual Christian aid, do require, tumults, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders,
vexations, strife, emulations, with a
world of evils, will ensue thereon; especially
will they do so, when men are prone to dwell
on the <hi>reall</hi> or <hi>supposed faults</hi> of others, which
on various pretences of <hi>pity</hi> for their persons,
or a <hi>detestation</hi> of their evils, or <hi>publick reproof</hi>
of them, they will aggravate, and so on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
expose them to publick censures, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
as they think, out of zeal to Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and a desire for the Churches good: For
the passions and interests of such persons, are
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57351:80"/>
ready to swell over the bounds of modesty, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and peace, though through the blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which all self-love is accompanied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
they seldome see clearly what they do.
Would we therefore labour to see a beauty,
desireableness and Honour in the greatest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement
of our thoughts, words and actions,
<hi>unto our selves and our own occasions,</hi> that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Duty will admit of, it might tend very
much to the preservation of Love and Peace
among Professors, for unto this end it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
unto us.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is strictly commanded us <hi>that
we should not judge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 1. 2.</note> 
               <hi>that we be not judged.</hi>
There is no Rule for mutual Conversation and
Communion,<note place="margin">Luke 6. 37.</note> in the Scripture, that is oftner
repeated, or more earnestly inculcated: Nor
is there any of more <hi>Vse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 3. 4. 10.</note> nor whose Grounds
and Reasons, are more <hi>evident</hi> or more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.
Judging and determining in our selves,<note place="margin">Jam. 4. 12.</note>
or divulging Censures concerning others,
their <hi>Persons, States,</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> towards
God, their Principles as to truth and sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
their ways as to Righteousness and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
whether past or present, any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than by the perfect Law of Liberty, and
that only when we are called thereunto in a
way of Duty, is the Poyson of <hi>common Love</hi>
and Peace, and the ruine of all Communion
and Society, be it of what Nature it will.
For us to judge and determine whether these
or those Churches are <hi>true Churches</hi> or no,
whether such Persons are <hi>Godly</hi> or no, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57351:81"/>
such of their Principles and actions are
regular or no, and so condemn them in our
Minds, (unless where open wickedness will
justifie the severest Reflections) is to <hi>speak
Evil of the Law,</hi> and to make our selves
Judges of it, as well as of them who toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with our selves are to be judged by it.
Nor is a judgment of that Nature necessary
unto our Advantage in the <hi>Discharge of any
Duty</hi> required at our hands. We may or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all our Concernments towards Churches
and Persons without making any <hi>such Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
concerning them. But so strong is the
Inclination of some Persons unto an <hi>Excess</hi>
in this kind, that no consideration can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with them to cast it out according to its
desert. Whether they do it as approving
and justifying themselves in what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
in others, or as a thing conducing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Interest, or out of <hi>Faction</hi> and an
especial Love to some one Party of Men, or
some secret Animosities and hatred against o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
it is a matter they seldome well quit
themselves of, whilst they are in this world.
Yea so far do some suffer themselves to be
transported, as that they cannot restrain
from charging of others with the Guilt of
such things as they know to be <hi>charged on
themselves,</hi> by them who pretend to be the
only competent Judges in such Cases. And
so will they also reflect upon, and complain
of other men for Miscarriages by <hi>severities,</hi>
in Instances exceedingly inferior, as by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57351:81"/>
represented, unto what it is known
they were ingaged in. But men are apt to
think well of all they do themselves, or those
whom they peculiarly regard, and to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
whatever they conceive amiss in such
as they dislike. Were it not better by Love
to <hi>cover a multitude of faults,</hi> and to leave
the Judgment of Persons and things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we are not concerned, unto him who judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Righteously, and will render unto every
Man according to his works? However cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it is, that untill the Evil Fountain of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
waters be stopped, untill we cease to
<hi>bless God even the Father,</hi> and at the same
time to <hi>curse Men made after the Similitude
of God,</hi> the wounds that have been given to
the Love and Peace of Professors will not be
healed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, unto the same End are all Men
forbidden to think that they have a <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
over the Faith of others, or that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
and disposal of it is committed unto
them. It is Christ alone who is the <hi>Lord of
the Consciences</hi> of his Disciples. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the best and greatest of the Sons of Men,
who have been appointed by him to deal with
others in his Name,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1. 24.</note> have constantly disclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
all thoughts of Power or Rule,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 3.</note> over the
Consciences or Faith of the meanest of his
Subjects. How many ways this may be done,
we are filled with <hi>Experiences;</hi> for no way
whereby it may be so, hath been left unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted.
And the Evil of it hath invaded
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57351:82"/>
both <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Particular Persons:</hi> Some
whereof who have been active in casting of
the <hi>Dominion</hi> of others, seem to have design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Possession of it in themselves. And it is
well, if where one <hi>Pope</hi> is rejected, many do
not rise in his Place, who want nothing but
his Power and Interest, to do his work. The
Indignation of some, that others <hi>do not in all
things comply</hi> with their Sentiments, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
themselves unto their Apprehensions and
Dictates, ariseth from this Presumption: And
the <hi>Persecutions</hi> wherein others ingage, do
all grow out of the same bitter Root. For
men can no otherwise satisfie their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
herein, but by a supposition that they are
warranted to <hi>give measures</hi> unto the Minds
and Practices of others, that is, their Faith and
Consciences, in Sacred things. And whilst
this <hi>Presumptious Supposition</hi> under any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
or colour possesseth the Minds of Men, it
will variously act its self unto the Destruction
of that Gospel Unity, which it is our Duty to
preserve. For when they are perswaded that
others ought to give up themselves absolutely
to their Guidance in the things of Religion,
either because of their <hi>Office</hi> and Dignity, or
because they are <hi>Wiser</hi> than they, or it may
be are only able to <hi>dispute</hi> more then they, if
they do not immediately so do, especially
seeing they cannot but judg themselves in the
Right in all things, they are ready to charge
their Refusal on all the <hi>Corrupt Affections,</hi>
Principles and Practices, which they can sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57351:82"/>
or, their supposed just indignation
suggest unto them. That they are <hi>proud, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,</hi>
self-conceited, wilful, factious, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
concluded; and a semblance unto
such Charges shall be diligently sought out,
and improved. Nothing but a deceiving Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
that they are some way or other
meet to have a <hi>Dominion</hi> over the Faith of
their Brethren and Fellow-Servants, would
prevail with men, otherwise Sober and Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
so to deal with all that dissent from them,
as they are pleased to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> All these Evils mentioned are
much increased in the minds of men,<note place="margin">Rom. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3.</note> when
they are <hi>puffed up</hi> with a conceit of their <hi>own
Knowledge</hi> and Wisdom:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 1.</note> This therefore <hi>we
are warned to avoid,</hi> that the Edification of
the Church may be promoted, and Love
preserved: For hence are very many
apt to take <hi>false measures</hi> of things,
especially of themselves, and thereon
to cast themselves into many mischievous
Mistakes.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12.</note> And this is apt to befal them, who
for ends best known unto themselves, have
with any ordinary diligence attended to the
study of Learning. For upon a supposal of
some competent furniture with <hi>Natural Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi>
they cannot but attain some skill and
knowledge that the common sort of unstudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
persons are unacquainted withal. Oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
indeed, their <hi>Pre-eminence</hi> in this kind,
consists in matters of very small consequence
or importance. But whatever it be, it is
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57351:83"/>
ready to make them think strange of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
advice,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 18.</note> 
               <hi>If any man seemeth to be wise
in this world, let him become a Fool, that he
may be wise;</hi> apt it is to <hi>puffe them up,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
their minds with a good conceit of
themselves, and a contempt of others. Hence
may we see some, when they have gotten a
little skill in <hi>Languages,</hi> and through custome
advantaged by the reading of some Books,
are able readily to express some thoughts, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
not <hi>originally</hi> their own, presently
conceit themselves to be so much wiser than
the multitude of unlettered persons, that
they are altogether impatient, that in any
thing they should dissent from them: And
this is a common frame with them whose
<hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>Wit</hi> being their All, do yet
reach but <hi>half way</hi> towards the useful ends
of such things. Others also there are, and
of them, not a few, who having been in the
ways wherein the Skill and Knowledge men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
are usually attained, yet through
their <hi>Incapacity</hi> or Negligence, or some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
Habit of Mind, or course of Life,
have not really at all improved in them. And
yet these also, having once attained the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of <hi>Ecclesiastical Offices</hi> or Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are as forward as any, to declaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
and pretend a contempt of that Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
in others, which they are not so stupid,
as not to know that the guilt of it may be
reflected on themselves. However these
things, at best, and in their highest improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57351:83"/>
are far enough from <hi>solid Wisdom;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
that which is from above, and
which alone will promote the Peace and Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Church. Some have no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
by them, but that they can declare and
speak out their own weakness; others that
they can <hi>rail,</hi> and <hi>lie,</hi> and <hi>falsly accuse,</hi> in
Words and Language wherewith they hope
to please the vilest of men. And certain it
is, that <hi>Science,</hi> which whatever it be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Grace of God, <hi>is but falsly so called,</hi>
and oftentimes falsly pretended unto, for this
evil end of it alone is apt to lift up the minds
of men above others, who perhaps come not
behind them in any useful understanding. Yea,
suppose men to have really attained a <hi>singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
degree</hi> in useful knowledge and wisdom,
and that either in things spiritual and divine,
or in Learning and Sciences, or in Political
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udence; yet Experience shews us, that
an hurtful elation of mind is apt to arise from
them, if the Souls of men be not well bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced
with Humility, and this evil particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
watched against. Hence ariseth that
Impatience of <hi>Contradiction,</hi> that Jealousie
and tenderness of mens own Names and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,
those sharp revenges they are
ready to take of any supposed Inroads upon
them, or disrespects towards them, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
&amp; undervaluation of other mens Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
those <hi>Magisterial Impositions</hi> and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
which proceed from men under a Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of these Endowments. The Cautions
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57351:84"/>
given us in the Scripture against this frame
of Spirit, the Examples that are proposed
unto us to the contrary, even that of <hi>Christ
himself,</hi> the Commands that are multiplied
for Lowliness of mind, Jealousie over our
selves, the Soveraignty of God in chusing
whom he pleaseth to reveal his Mind and
Truth unto and by, may in the consideration
of them be useful to prevent such Surprizals
with <hi>Pride,</hi> Self-conceit, and contempt of
others, as supposed or abused knowledge are
apt to cast men into, whereby Divisions are
greatly fomented and increased among us.
But it may be these things will not much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
with them, who pretending a Zeal and
Principle above others in Preaching, and ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the <hi>Examples of Christ,</hi> do in most of
their ways and actings, and in some of their
Writings, give us an unparallel'd Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Devil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> It is confessed by all, that <hi>False
Teachers,</hi> Seducers, Broachers of Novel
Corrupt and <hi>Heretical</hi> Doctrines, have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
many Breaches and Divisions among such
as once agreed in the Profession of the same
Truths and Points of Faith: By means of
such persons, whether within the present
<hi>Church-State,</hi> or without, there is scarce
<hi>any Sacred Truth,</hi> which had formerly secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
its station and possession in the minds of
the generality of Christians in this Nation,
but what hath been solicited, or opposed.
Some make their Errors the principal Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57351:84"/>
Rule and Measure in Communion:
Whoever complies with them therein, is <hi>of
them;</hi> and whoso doth not, they avoid; so
at once they shut up themselves from having
any thing to do with them that <hi>love Truth</hi>
and <hi>Peace.</hi> And where these consequents
do not ensue, mens Zeal for their Errors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overballanced by their love of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
in their secular interest, and their minds
influenced by the novel prevailing Opinion
of a <hi>great Indifferency</hi> in all things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
unto Outward Worship; yet the
advancing and fomenting of Opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto that <hi>Sound Doctrine</hi> which hath
been generally owned and taught by the
Learned and Godly Pastors, and received by
the People themselves, cannot but occasion
Strife, Contentions, and Divisions among
Professors. And it may be, there are very
few of those <hi>Articles</hi> or Heads of Religion,
which in the beginning of the Reformation,
and a long time after, were looked on as the
most <hi>useful,</hi> important and necessary parts
of our Profession, that have not been among
us variously opposed and corrupted. And in
these <hi>Differences about Doctrine,</hi> lie the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Causes of the Animosities whereby
<hi>those about Worship</hi> and Discipline are manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
For those who have the advantage of
Law and Power on their side in these lesser
things, are not so <hi>unwise</hi> as to deal openly
with their Adversaries about those things,
wherein the Reputation of established and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57351:85"/>
commonly received Doctrines lie against
them. But under the pretence and shelter
of contending for Legal Appointments, not
a few do exercise an Enmity against those who
<hi>profess the Truth,</hi> which they think it not
meet as yet openly to oppose.</p>
            <p>Such are the <hi>Causes,</hi> and such are the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions</hi>
of the Differences and Divisions in
and about Religious Concerns, that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us; by such means have they been fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
and encreased: Heightned they have
been by the personal faults and miscarriages
of many of all sorts and parties. And as
the reproof of their sinful failings is in its
proper season a necessary duty; so no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
or Amendment of persons will
give a full relief, nor free us from the evil
of our Divisions, until the <hi>Principles</hi> and
<hi>ways</hi> which occasion them, be taken out of
the way.</p>

the general <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi>
of our Differences, and that present
want of Christian Love which is complained
of by many; we shall now return to give
some more particular account concerning our
<hi>Inconformity</hi> unto, and Non-compliance with
the Observances and Constitutions of the
Church of <hi>England.</hi> It is acknowledged,
that we do in sundry things dissent from them;
that we do not, that we cannot come up unto
a <hi>joint Practice</hi> with others in them. It is
also confessed, that hereon there doth ensue
an appearance of <hi>Schisme</hi> between them and
us, according as the common notion of it
is received in the world. And because in this
distance and difference, the <hi>Dissent</hi> unto
Compliance is on our parts; there is a sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of a voluntary relinquishment of your
Communion: And this we know exposeth
us, in <hi>Vulgar Judgments</hi> and Apprehensions,
unto the Charge of <hi>Schisme,</hi> and necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
us unto self-defence; as though the only
matter in question were, whether we are
guilty of this evil or no. For that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
have all Churches which have had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57351:86"/>
to <hi>fix terms of Communion,</hi> right
or wrong, just or unequal; the Differences
which ensue thereon, they will try out on
no other terms, but only whether those that
dissent from them, are <hi>Schismaticks</hi> or not.
Thus they make themselves <hi>Actors</hi> oft-times
in this Cause, who ought in the first place
to be charged with <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

made meerly at the hazard of the Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of those, who are causelesly put upon
their Purgation and Defence. Yea with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
a kind of <hi>Possession</hi> and <hi>Multitude,</hi> do
render Dissenters unquestionably <hi>Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal;</hi>
so that it is esteemed an unreasonable
Confidence in them, to deny themselves so
to be. So deals the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with
those that are Reformed. An <hi>open Schisme</hi>
there is between them; and if they cannot
sufficiently fix the Guilt of it on the <hi>Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
by confidence and clamours, with the
advantage of Prepossession; yet, as if they
they were perfectly innocent themselves, they
will allow of no other Enquiry in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but what consists in calling the <hi>Truth</hi> and
<hi>Reputation</hi> of the other Party, into question.
It being our present condition to lie under
this Charge from many, whose Interest it is
to have us thought guilty thereof, we do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that there is any <hi>culpable secession made by
us,</hi> from the Communion of any that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the Gospel in these Nations, or that the
blame of the <hi>appearing Schisme</hi> that is among
us, can duly or justly be reflected on us;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57351:86"/>
which in the Remainder of our Discourse,
we shall make to appear.</p>
            <p>What are our Thoughts and Judgments,
concerning the <hi>Church-state</hi> and <hi>Interest</hi> of
the Professors of the Gospel in this Nation,
we have before declared. And we hope they
are such, that in the Judgment of persons
sober and impartial, we shall be relieved
from those clamorous Accusations, which
are without number or measure, by some
cast upon us. Our Prayers are also conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
unto the <hi>God of Love and Peace</hi> for
the taking away of all Divisions and their
Causes from among us. Nor is the satisfaction
which ariseth from our <hi>sincerity</hi> herein, in
the least taken off, or rent from us, by the
uncharitable Endeavours of some, to rake
up pretences to the contrary. And should
those, in whose <hi>power</hi> it is, think meet to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate
the <hi>Pastors and Guides</hi> of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
of old, and to follow them in any of
the wayes which they used for the Restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Vnity</hi> and Agreement unto Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
when lost or endangered, we should not
decline the contribution of any assistance, by
Counsel or Fraternal Compliance, which
God should be pleased to supply us withal.
But whilst some whose advantages render
them considerable in these matters, seem to
entertain no other Thoughts concerning us,
but what issue in <hi>Violence</hi> and Oppression,
the principal duty incumbent on us is, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
to approve our Consciences unto God,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57351:87"/>
that in <hi>sincerity of heart</hi> we desire in all things
to please him, and to conform our Lives,
Principles and Practises to his Will, so far as
he is graciously pleased to make it known
unto us. And as for men, we hope so to
discharge the Duty required of us, as that
none may justly charge us with any Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<hi>Vnpeaceableness,</hi> or other evils: For
we do not apprehend that we are either the
cause or culpable occasion of those Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
and Troubles which some have <hi>put
themselves unto</hi> by their endeavours for our
disturbance, impoverishing and ruine. Let
none imagine, but that we have considered
the Evils, and evil Consequents of the
<hi>Schismes</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> that are among us;
and those who do so, do it upon the forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of their Charity. We know how much
the great work of <hi>Preaching the Gospel</hi> unto
the Conversion of the Souls of men is impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
thereby; as also what prejudice ariseth
thence against the Truth, wherein we are all
agreed; with what Temptations, and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
exasperations, to the loss of Love, and the
occasioning of many sinful Miscarriages in
persons of all sorts, do hereon ensue: But
we deny that it is in <hi>our power</hi> to remove
them, or take them out of the way, nor are
we conscious unto our selves of any <hi>Sin</hi> or
<hi>Evil,</hi> in what we do, or in what we do not
do, by our not doing of it in the Worship of
God. It is <hi>Duty alone</hi> unto Jesus Christ,
whereunto in these things we attend, and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57351:87"/>
wherein we ought so to do. And where
Matters of this nature are so circumstanced,
as that <hi>Duty</hi> will contribute nothing towards
Unity, we are at a loss for any progress to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it. The Sum of what is objected
unto us, (as hath been observed) is our
<hi>Non-Conformity,</hi> or our forbearance of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
personal Communion with the present
Church-Constitutions, in the Modes, Rites,
and Ceremonies of its Worship: Hence the
<hi>Schisme</hi> complained of, doth ensue. Unless
this Communion be <hi>total,</hi> constant, without
endeavour of any Alteration or Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we cannot in the judgment of some, be
freed from the guilt hereof. This we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and are perswaded that it is to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
elsewhere: For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> All the Conditions of absolute and
compleat Communion with the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> which are proposed unto us, and
indispensibly required of us, especially as we
are Ministers, are <hi>Vnscriptural;</hi> such as the
Word of God doth neither warrant, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor intimate, especially not under any
such consideration, as <hi>necessary Conditions</hi> of
Communion in or among the Churches of
Christ. We dispute not now about the
<hi>Lawfulness</hi> or <hi>Vnlawfulness</hi> or things in
themselves; nor whether they may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
or no, by such as have no conviction
of any Sin or Evil in them. Neither do we
judge or censure them, by whom they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served:
Our Enquiry is solely about our
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57351:88"/>
own Liberty and Duty. And what concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them, is resolved into this <hi>one Question,</hi>
as to the Argument in hand: <hi>Whether such
Things or Observances in the Worship of God,
as are wholly unscriptural, may be so made the
indispensible Condition of Communion with
any particular Church, as that they by whom
they are so made and imposed on others, should
be justified in their so doing; and that if any
Differences, Divisions or Schismes, do ensue
thereon, the guilt and blame of them must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
fall on those who refuse submission
to them, or to admit of them as such?</hi> That
the Conditions proposed unto us, and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
on us indispensibly, if we intend to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the Communion of this Church, are of
this nature, we shall afterwards prove by an
induction of Instances. Nor is it of any
concernment in this matter, what place the
things enquired after do hold, or are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to hold in the Worship of God; our
present Enquiry is about their warranty to
be made <hi>conditions</hi> of <hi>Church-Communion.</hi>
Now we are perswaded that the Lord Christ
hath set his Disciples at liberty from accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of such terms of Communion from any
Churches in the world: And on the same
Grounds we deny, that he hath given or
granted unto them Authority, to constitute
such Terms and Conditions of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and indispensibly to impose them
upon all that enjoy it, according to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
capacities and concerns therein: For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:57351:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> The <hi>Rule of Communion</hi> among the
Disciples of Christ in all his Churches, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably
established and fixed by himself. His
Commission, Direction and Command, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out unto the first Planters and Founders
of them, containing an obliging Rule unto
all that should succeed them throughout all
Generations, hath so established the Bounds,
Limits and Conditions of Church-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as that it is not lawful for any to attempt
their Removal or Alteration.<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>Go ye,</hi> saith he
to them, <hi>and teach all Nations, Baptizing
them in the Name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them
to observe all things whatever I have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you, and lo I am with you alwayes, even unto
the end of the world.</hi> All the Benefits and
Blessings, all the Comfort and use of Church-Assemblies
and Communion, depends alone
on the promise of the <hi>Presence of Christ</hi>
with them. Thence doth all the Authority
that may be exercised in them proceed; and
thence doth the efficacy of what they do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the edification of the Souls of men, arise
and flow. Now that any one may thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the <hi>Presence of Christ</hi> in any Church, with
the Fruits and Benefits of it, no more can
be required of him, but that through the
Preaching of the Gospel, and Baptism, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made a professed Disciple, he do, or be
ready to do and observe all whatsoever
Christ hath commanded. This hath he
established as the <hi>Rule of Communion</hi> among
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57351:89"/>
his Disciples and Churches in all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
In all other things which do relate unto
the Worship of God, he hath set them, and
left them at liberty,<note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1.</note> which so far as it is a
<hi>Grant</hi> and <hi>Priviledge</hi> purchased for them,
they are obliged to make good and maintain.
We know it will be here replied, that among
the Commands of Christ, it is, that we
should <hi>hear the Church,</hi> and <hi>obey the Guides
and Rulers thereof:</hi> Whatever therefore is
appointed by them, we are to submit unto,
and observe, even by virtue of the Command
of Christ. And indeed it is certainly true,
that it is the Will and Command of the
Lord Jesus, that we should both hear the
Church, and obey the Guides of it: But
by virtue of this Rule, neither the Church
nor its Guides can make any thing necessary
to the Disciples of Christ, as a condition
of Communion with them, but only what he
hath commanded. For the Rule here laid
down is given unto those <hi>Guides or Rulers;</hi>
who are thereby bound up, in the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of what the Disciples are to observe,
unto the Commands of Christ. And were
a Command included herein, of obeying
the Commands or Appointments of Church-Guides,
and the promise of the <hi>Presence of
Christ</hi> annexed thereunto; as he had given
them all his own Power, and placed them in
his Throne, so we had been all obliged to
follow them whither ever they had carried
or led us, although it were to <hi>Hell it self,</hi>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:57351:89"/>
as some of the <hi>Canonists;</hi> on this Principle,
have spoken concerning the <hi>Pope.</hi> Here
therefore is a Rule of Communion fixed,
both unto them that are to rule in the
Church, and them that are to obey. And
whereas, perhaps it may be said, that if
the Rulers of the Church may <hi>appoint no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
in and unto the Communion of the
Church, but what Christ hath himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
then indeed is their Authority lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
worth, yea, upon the matter none at all:
For the Commands of Christ are sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirmed and fixed by his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and to what end then serves that of
the Rulers of the Church? We must say,
that their <hi>whole Authority</hi> is limited in the
Text, unto <hi>Teaching of men to observe what
Christ hath commanded.</hi> And this they are
to do with Authority; but under him, and
in his Name; and according to the Rules
that he hath given them. And those who
think not this Power sufficient for them,
must seek it elsewhere; for the Lord Christ
will allow no more in his Churches.</p>
            <p>To make this yet more evident, we may
consider that particular <hi>Instance,</hi> wherein
the Primitive Christians had a Trial, in the
Case as now stated before us: And this was
in the Matter of <hi>Mosaical Ceremonies and
Institutions,</hi> which some would have imposed
on them, as a condition of their Communion
in the Profession of the Gospel: In the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
hereof, was their Liberty assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57351:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by the Apostles, and their Duty declared
to abide therein. And this was the most
specious Pretence of imposing on the <hi>Liberty
of Christians,</hi> that ever they were exercised
withal. For the Observation of these things
had countenance given unto it, from their
<hi>Divine Original,</hi> and the condescending
Practice of the Apostles for a good season.
That other Instances of the like nature should
be condemned in the Scripture is impossible,
seeing none had then endeavoured the Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of any of that Nature. But a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Rule</hi> may be established in the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of one Case, as well as in that of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
provided it be not extended beyond
what is eminently included in that case. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
therefore was there a Direction given
for the Duty and Practise of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in following Ages; and that in pursuit
of the Law and Constitution of the Lord
Christ before-mentioned. Neither is there
any force in the Exception, that these
things were imposed under a pretence of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>commanded by God</hi> himself: For they
say, to require any thing under that Notion,
which indeed he hath not commanded, is an
<hi>Adding</hi> to his Command, which ought not
to be admitted: But to require things <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi>
without that pretence, may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
But as in the former way, men adde
unto the Commands of God <hi>Formally,</hi> so in
this latter, they do it <hi>Materially,</hi> which also
is prohibited: For in his Worship, we
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57351:90"/>
are forbidden to adde to the things that he
hath appointed, no less than to pretend com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
from him which he hath not given.
He therefore who professeth and pleadeth his
willingness to <hi>observe and do</hi> in Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
whatever Christ hath instituted and
commanded, cannot regularly be refused the
Communion of any Church, under any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of his refusal to do other things, which
confessedly are not so required.</p>
            <p>It is pleaded indeed, that no other things,
as to the <hi>Substance</hi> of the Worship of God,
can or ought to be appointed, besides what
is instituted by Jesus Christ: But as to the
<hi>Manner</hi> or <hi>Modes</hi> of the Performance of
what he doth command, with other <hi>Rites</hi>
and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> to be observed for <hi>Order</hi> and
<hi>Decency,</hi> they may lawfully be instituted by
by the Rulers of the Church. Let it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
at present be granted, that so they may
be by them who are perswaded of the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of those <hi>Modes,</hi> and of the things
wherein they consist; seeing that is not the
question at present under agitation. Neither
will this Concession help us in our present
Enquiry, unless it be also granted, that
whatever may be <hi>lawfully practised</hi> in the
worship of God, may be lawfully made a
<hi>necessary Condition</hi> of Communion in that
Worship: But this will not be granted, nor
can it ever be proved. Besides, in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Difference, this is only the Judgment of
<hi>one Party,</hi> that the things mentioned may be
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57351:91"/>
Lawfully observed in and among Sacred Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations:
And thereon the Conclusion
must be, that whatever <hi>some</hi> think may be
lawfully practised in Divine Worship, may
lawfully be made an indispensible condition
of Communion unto the <hi>whole.</hi> Nor will it
give force unto this Inference, that those who
judge them lawful are the <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>Guides</hi>
of the Church, unto whose determination
the Judgment of private persons is not to be
opposed: For we have shewed before, that
a Judgment concerning what any one is to
do or practise in the worship of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
unto <hi>every man</hi> who is to do or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
ought therein; and he who makes it not,
is brutish. And the Judgment which the
Rulers of the Church are to make for the
whole, or to go before it, is, in what is
c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mmanded, or not so, by Jesus Christ, not
in what is fit to be added <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hereunto by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Besides if it must be allowed that
such things may be made the <hi>conditions</hi> of
<hi>Church-Communion,</hi> then any who are in
place of Authority, may multiply such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
according unto the utmost extent of
their Judgments, until they become burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
and intolerable unto all, or really ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
in themselves, as it is fallen out in the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome:</hi> But this would prove ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
destructive unto that certain and <hi>unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable
Rule of Church-communion,</hi> which the
Lord Christ hath fixed and established; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we shall speak again afterward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:57351:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Neither will that Plea, which is by some
insisted on in this case, yield any solid or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
relief. It is said, that <hi>some may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantably
and duly observe in the Worship of
God,</hi> what is <hi>unduly and unwarrantably</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
on them by others. And indeed all
Controversies about Church-Constitution,
Discipline, and external Worship, are by
<hi>some</hi> reduced unto these two Heads; that the
<hi>Magistrate</hi> may appoint what he pleaseth,
and the <hi>People</hi> may observe whatever he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points:
For as there is no Government of
the Church determined in the Scripture, it
is meet it should be erected and disposed by
the supreme <hi>Magistrate,</hi> who, no doubt, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that supposition, is only fit and qualified
so to do: And for <hi>outward worship,</hi> and the
Rites thereof, both it and they are so far <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,</hi>
as that we may comply with whatever
is imposed on us; whether they be good, or
useful, or evil, lies at the doors of others to
answer about. But this seems to rise up in
express <hi>contradiction</hi> unto those Commands
which are given us, to <hi>stand fast in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
wherewith Christ hath made us free;</hi> and
in these things, not <hi>to be servants of men,</hi>
For what do we do less, than renounce
the Priviledge of our Liberty purchased
for us at an high rate and Price, or
what are we less than <hi>Servants of Men,</hi>
whilst we bring our selves in bondage unto
the observation of such things in the worship
of God, as we judge neither commanded
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57351:92"/>
by him, nor tending unto our own Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but meerly because by them ordained?
Moreover, suppose it be the Judgment of
some, as it is of many, that the things
mentioned, though in their own nature indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
do become <hi>unlawful</hi> unto them to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
when imposed as necessary conditions of
all Church-Communion, contrary to the
command and appointment of Christ? We
know this is exceedingly <hi>declaimed against</hi> as
that which is perverse and froward. For what,
say many, can be more unreasonable, than that
things in <hi>their own nature indifferent</hi> should
become <hi>unlawful</hi> because they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?
But it is at least no less unreasonable,
that things <hi>confessedly indifferent</hi> should not
be left so, but be rendred necessary unto pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
though useless in it, by arbitrary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
But the opinion traduced, is also
much mistaken. For although it be granted
that the things themselves are <hi>indifferent</hi> in
their own nature, not capable, but as deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by circumstances, of either moral good
or evil; yet it is not granted that the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of them, even as <hi>uncommanded,</hi> is indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in the Worship of God. And although
the command doth not alter the Nature, and
make that which was indifferent become <hi>evil,</hi>
yet that command of its self being contrary to
many divine commands and instructions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us in the Scripture, a complyance with
the things commanded therein may become
unlawful to us. And what shall they do whose
judgment this is? shall they admit of them
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57351:92"/>
as <hi>lawful,</hi> upon the consideration of that
change about them, which renders them <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful?</hi>
This they will not easily be induced
to give their assent unto.</p>
            <p>Let therefore the Rule of Church Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
be observed which our Lord Jesus Christ
hath fixed; and no small occasion of our
strifes and divisions will be removed out of
the way. But whilst there is this contest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, If one pleads his readiness <hi>to do and
observe whatever the Lord Christ hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi>
and cannot be convinced of insincerity in
his profession, or of want of understanding in
any known Institution of his, and thereon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
the Communion of any Church; but
others say nay, you shall observe and do sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
other things that <hi>we our selves have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted,</hi>
or you shall have no communion
with us: as it cannot be but that Divisions
and <hi>Schisms</hi> will ensue thereon; so it will
not be difficult for an indifferent by-stander,
to judge on whether side the occasion and
guilt of them doth remain.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have the <hi>Practise</hi> of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
in the pursuance of the Direction and
Command of their Lord and ours, for our
Guide in this Case. And it may be well and
safely thought, that this should give a certain
Rule unto the proceedings and actings of all
Church-Guides in future Ages. Now they did
never make any thing <hi>unscriptural,</hi> or what
they had not received by <hi>divine Revelation,</hi> to
be a condition of Communion in Religious
Worship &amp; Church Order among Christians.

edification in faith and holiness; but as for
the <hi>Institution of Festivals</hi> or <hi>Fasts,</hi> of <hi>Rites</hi> or
<hi>Ceremonies</hi> to be observed in the Worship of
the Churches, they intermedled with no such
things. And thence it came to pass, that in
the first entrance and admission of <hi>Observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
about such things, there was a great and
endless variety in them, both as to the things
themselves observed, and as to the manner of
their observation. And this was gradually
increased unto such an height and excess, as
that the <hi>burden</hi> of them became intolerable
unto Christendome. Nor indeed could any
better success be expected in a relinquishment
and departure from the Pattern of Church
Order, given us in their example and practise.
Neither is the Plea from hence built meerly
on this consideration, that no man alive, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
from their Writings, or the approved
Records of those Times, can manifest that they
ever prescribed unto the Churches, or impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

of their Communion; but also it so fell out
in the good providence of God, that the <hi>Case</hi>
under debate, was proposed unto them, and
joyntly determined by them. For being cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
unto advice and counsel, in the case of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57351:93"/>
difference that was between the <hi>Jewish</hi> and
<hi>Gentile</hi> Converts, and Professors, wherein the
former laboured to impose on the latter the
observation of <hi>Moses Institutions,</hi> as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of their joynt Communion, as was
mentioned even now, they not only determine
against any such <hi>Imposition,</hi> but also expresly
declare that nothing but necessary things
(that is, such as are so from other Reasons
antecedently unto their Prescriptions and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments)
ought to be required of any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
in the Communion or Worship of the
Church.<note place="margin">Acts 15.</note> And as they neither did nor would
on that great occasion, in that <hi>Solemn Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi>
appoynt any <hi>one thing</hi> to be observed by
the Disciples and Churches which the Lord
Christ had not commanded; so in their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
given unto the <hi>Gentile</hi> Believers for a
temporary abstinence from the use of their
Liberty in one or two Instances whereunto it
did extend, they plainly <hi>intimate,</hi> that it was
the avoydance of a <hi>present Scandal,</hi> which
might have greatly retarded the progress of
the Gospel, that was the reason of that Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And in such Cases it is granted, that
we may in many things for a season forgo the
use of our Liberty. This was their way and
Practise, this the <hi>Example</hi> which they left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all that should follow them in the Rule and
Guidance of the Church. Whence it is come
to pass in After-Ages, that men should think
themselves <hi>wiser</hi> than they, or more careful to
provide for the peace and unity of the Church,
we know not. But let the bounds and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57351:94"/>
of Church Communion fixed in and by
their <hi>Example,</hi> stand unmoved, and many
causes of our <hi>present Divisions</hi> will be taken
away. But it may be it will be offered, that
the <hi>Present state of things</hi> in the World, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
some alteration in, or variation from
the precise <hi>Example</hi> of the Apostles in this
matter. The due observation of the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Christ in such manner as the nature of
of them required, was then sufficient unto the
Peace and Unity of the Churches. But <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Simplicity</hi> is now decayed amongst the
most; so that a multiplication of Rules and
Observances is needful for the same ends.
But we have shewed before, that the <hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation</hi>
of Church Rule and Communion to
the <hi>Degeneracy of Christians</hi> or Churches, or
their Secular Engagements, is no way advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
unto Religion. Let them whose Duty
it is, endeavour to reduce Professors and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
to the <hi>Primitive Standard</hi> of Light,
Humility, and Holiness, and they may be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
in all Church concerns, according to
the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Pattern. Wherefore when
Christians unto the former Plea of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness
to <hi>observe, and do,</hi> whatsoever Christ
hath commanded them, do also adde their
willingness to comply with whatever the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi>
of Christ have either by <hi>Precept,</hi> or
<hi>Example</hi> in their own practise, commended
unto them, or did do or require in the first
Churches, and cannot be convinced of failing
to make good their Profession; we do not
know whence any can derive a Warranty
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57351:94"/>
enabling them to impose any other <hi>conditions
of communion</hi> on them. The <hi>Institution</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the Lord Christ, and the <hi>Practise</hi> of
the Apostles, lye directly against the imposing
of the conditions enquired about. And first
to <hi>invent</hi> them, then to <hi>impose</hi> them, making
them necessary to be observed, and then to
judg and censure them as <hi>Schismaticks,</hi> as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to Love and Peace, who do not submit
unto them, looks not unlike the exercise of an
unwarrantable <hi>Dominion</hi> over the Faith and
Consciences of the Disciples of Christ.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, not only by their Example and
Practice, but they have also <hi>Doctrinally</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
what is the Duty of Churches, and
what is the Liberty of Christians in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> discourseth at large
hereon; <hi>Rom. 14. 15. Chap.</hi> The attentive
Reading of those <hi>two Chapters,</hi> is sufficient to
determine this Cause among all uninterested
and unprejudiced Persons. He supposeth in
them, and it is the Case which he exemplifies
in sundry Instances, that there were among
Christians and Churches at that time, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<hi>Apprehensions</hi> and <hi>Observances</hi> about
some things appertaining unto the worship of
God: And these things were such, as had
some seeming Countenance of a Sacred and
<hi>Divine Authority,</hi> for such was their Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Institution. Some in the consideration
hereof, judged that they were still to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served;
and their <hi>Consciences</hi> had been long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in an holy subjection unto the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of God in the Observance of them. Nor
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57351:95"/>
was there <hi>yet</hi> any express and Positive Law e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
for their Abrogation; but the cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of any Obligation unto their Observance
from their <hi>Primitive Institution,</hi> was to be
gathered from the nature of Gods <hi>Oeconomy</hi>
towards his Church. Many therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to observe them, esteeming it their
Duty so to do. Others were perswaded and
satisfied that they were freed from any Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
unto the owning and observance of
them. And whereas this <hi>Liberty</hi> was given
them by Jesus Christ in the Gospel, they
were resolved to make use of it, and not to
comply with the other sort, who pressed
<hi>Conformity</hi> upon them in their Ceremonies
and Modes of Divine worship. So it may
fall out in other Instances. Some may be
perswaded, that such or such things may
be <hi>Lawful</hi> for them to observe in the worship
of God; they may be so unto them, and, as is
supposed, in their own Nature. On the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of some Circumstances they may
judg that it is <hi>convenient</hi> or expedient to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto their Observance; Lastly, all <hi>Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidencies</hi>
weighed, that it is <hi>necessary</hi> that so
they should do; and that others also that
walk with them in the Profession of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
should conform themselves unto their
Order and Practice. On the other hand some
there are, who because the things of the joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practice
required, are not <hi>appointed by Jesus
Christ,</hi> nor doth it appear unto them, that
he hath given Power unto any others to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57351:95"/>
them, do not judg it <hi>expedient,</hi> nor yet,
all Circumstances considered, <hi>Lawful</hi> to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
them. Now whereas this <hi>Case</hi> answers
unto that before proposed, the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof given by the Apostle, may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be applyed unto this also. What Rule
therefore doth he give therein, which he
would have attended unto, as the means for
the Preservation of Love, Peace, and Unity
among them? Is it that the former sort of
Persons, provided they be the most, or have
the most Power, ought to impose the Practice
of those things which they esteem <hi>Lawful</hi> and
<hi>Convenient,</hi> on those who <hi>judg them not so;</hi>
when it is out of Question, that they are not
appointed by Christ; only it is pretended
that they are not forbidden by him? Where
indeed the <hi>Question</hi> was about the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Christ, he binds up the Churches pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
unto what <hi>he had received</hi> from him.
But in cases of this nature,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23.</note> wherein a direct
command of Christ cannot be pleaded nor
is pretended, he absolutely rejects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
all thoughts of such a procedure. But
supposing, that Differences in Judgment and
Practice were and would be among Christians,
the Sum of his Advice is, that all Offences
and <hi>Scandals</hi> ought to be diligently avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
that <hi>censuring, judging,</hi> and despisings
on the account of such Differences, be cast out;
that <hi>tenderness</hi> be used towards them that are
weak, and nothing severely prest on them
that <hi>Doubt;</hi> and for their different Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57351:96"/>
and Ways, they should all walk in
Peace, condescending unto, and bearing with
one another. Nothing can more evidently
determine the <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of imposing on
Christians unscriptural Conditions of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
than do the Discourses of that Great
Apostle to this Purpose. Yea better it is, and
more agreeable unto the mind of Christ, that
Persons and particular Churches, should be
left unto different Observations in sundry
things relating unto Sacred worship, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they cannot joyn with each other, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
together, endeavouring in the mean
time to <hi>keep the Vnity of the spirit in the bond
of Peace;</hi> than that they should be inforced
unto an <hi>Vniformity</hi> in the Practice of things
that have not the immediate Authority of
Christ enstamped on them. Accordingly it
so fell out among them unto whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
gave these Directions, and that suitably
unto his Intention in them. For the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Parties,</hi> agreeing in the common
Faith and Profession of the Gospel, did yet
constantly meet in <hi>distinct Assemblies or
Churches,</hi> for the Celebration of Holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
because of the different Rites wherein
they did not agree. And in this <hi>Posture</hi> were
Peace and Love continued among them, untill
in process of Time, their Differences through
mutual forbearance being extinguished, they
Coalesced into one Church state and Order:
And the former <hi>Peace</hi> which they had in their
Distances, was deemed sufficient, whilst things
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57351:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were not measured nor regulated by secular
Interest or Advantages. But it is a part of
our present unhappiness, that <hi>such a Peace</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Christians and particular Churches, is
mistaken to have an ill Aspect upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
of some belonging unto the Church in
Power, Honour, and Revenue. But as we
apprehend there is, as things are now stated
among us, a plain <hi>mistake</hi> in this surmize,
so if the <hi>Glory</hi> of God, and the <hi>Honour</hi> of the
Gospel were chief in our Consultations about
Church Affairs, it would be with us of no
such consideration, as to hinder us from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
quietly the success and events of duty
unto the Providence of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There was also a signal Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Truth pleaded for, in an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Fact</hi> among the Primitive Churches.
There was an opinion which prevailed very
early among them, about the necessary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of <hi>Easter,</hi> in the room of the <hi>Jewish
Passeover;</hi> for the solemn commemoration
of the Death and Resurrection of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:
And it was taken for granted by most
of them, that the observance hereof was
countenanced, if not rendred <hi>necessary</hi> unto
them, by the example of the Apostles: For
they generally believed that by them it was
observed, and that it was their Duty to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
themselves unto their practise;
only there was a difference about the <hi>precise
Time</hi> or Day, which they were to solemnize,
as the Head and Rule of their Festival; as
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57351:97"/>
every undue presumption hath one <hi>Lameness</hi>
or other accompanying it: It is Truth alone
which is square and steady. Some therefore
pleaded the example of <hi>John</hi> the Apostle and
Evangelist, who as it was strongly asserted
and testified by multitudes, kept his <hi>Easter</hi> at
such a time, and by such a Rule, whom they
thought meet to follow and imitate. Others,
not inferiour unto them in number or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
opposed unto their Time the example of
<hi>Peter,</hi> whom they affirmed (on what grounds
and Reasons they know best, for they are now
lost) to have observed his <hi>Easter</hi> at another
Time, and according unto a different Rule.
And it is scarcely imaginable how the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tests
hereabouts troubled the Churches both
of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia;</hi> who certainly had things
more material to have exercised themselves
about. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> embraced that
Opinion, which at length prevailed over the
other, and obtained a kind of <hi>Catholicisme</hi>
against that which was countenanced only by
the Authority of St. <hi>John;</hi> as that Church
was alwayes wondrous happy in reducing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Churches unto an acquiescency in its sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
as seldom wanting <hi>desire</hi> or <hi>skill</hi> dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terously
to improve its manifold advantages.
Now this was that <hi>Easter</hi> to be celebrated on
the <hi>Lords Day</hi> only, and not by the Rule of
the <hi>Jewish Passover,</hi> on the 14 day of the first
month, what day of the week soever it fell out
upon. Hereon <hi>Victor</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> of that Church,
being confident that the Truth was on his
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57351:97"/>
side, namely that <hi>Easter</hi> was to be observed
on the <hi>Lords Day,</hi> resolved to make it a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Communion</hi> unto all the Churches;
for otherwise he saw not how there could be
either Union, Peace, or Uniformity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them. He did not question but
that he had a good Foundation to build
upon: For that <hi>Easter</hi> was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
byvertue of <hi>Apostolical Tradition,</hi> was
generally granted by all. And he took it as
unquestionable upon a current and prevalent
<hi>Rumor,</hi> that the observation of it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to the <hi>Lords day</hi> by the example of St.
<hi>Peter.</hi> Hereupon he refused the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all that would not conform unto his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
for the observation of <hi>Easter</hi> on the
Lords day; and cast out of Communion all
those Persons and Churches, who would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
any other day; which proved to be the
condition of the principal Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi>
amongst whom the Apostle <hi>John</hi> did longest
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erse. Here was our present case direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exemplified, or represented so long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hand; the <hi>Success</hi> onely of this fact of
his, remaineth to be enquired into. Now it
is known unto all what entertainment this his
<hi>new Rule of Communion</hi> found among the
Churches of Christ. The Reproof of his
Precipitancy, and irregular fixing <hi>new bounds</hi>
unto Church Communion, was famous in
those days: Especially the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>buke</hi> given
unto him, and his practise, by one of
the most Holy and Learned Persons
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57351:98"/>
then living, is eminently celebrated, as
consonant to Truth and Peace, by those who
have transmitted unto us the <hi>Reports</hi> of those
Times. He who himself first condemned
others rashly, was for his so doing generally
condemned by all. Suppose now that any
Persons living at <hi>Rome,</hi> and there called into
Communion with the Church, should have
had the condition thereof proposed unto
them, namely that they should <hi>assent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that the observation of Easter by Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Tradition was to be on the Lords day only;</hi>
and upon their refusal so to do, should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
from Communion, or on their own
accords should refrain from it; where should
the Guilt of this Disorder and <hi>Schism</hi> be
charged? And thus it fell out, not only with
those who came out of <hi>Asia</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> who
were not received by that <hi>Diotrephes;</hi> but
also with sundry in that Church its self, as
<hi>Blastus</hi> and others; as what great Divisions
were occasioned hereby between the <hi>Saxons</hi>
and <hi>Brittains,</hi> hath been by many declared.
But in the Judgment of the primitive Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
the Guilt of these <hi>Schisms,</hi> was to be
charged on them that coyned and imposed
these <hi>new Rules</hi> and <hi>Conditions</hi> of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And had they not been judged by any,
the pernicious consequences of this temerari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Attempt are sufficient to reflect no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
Guilt upon it. Neither could
the whole <hi>Observance</hi> its self, from first to last,
ever compensate that loss of Love and Peace
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:57351:98"/>
among Christians, and Churches, which was
occasioned thereby; Nor hath the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of such things ever obtained any better
success in the Church of God. How free the
Churches were untill that time, after they
were once delivered from the Attempt of the
<hi>Circumcised Professors</hi> to impose upon them
the Ceremonies of <hi>Moses;</hi> from any appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of unwritten Conditions of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is manifest unto all, who have looked into
the Monuments which remain of those times.
It is very true, that sundry Christians took
upon them very early, the Observation of
<hi>sundry Rites</hi> and Usages in Religion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
they had no Guidance or Direction by
the word of God. For as the corrupted Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man, is prone to the Invention and
use of sensible present things in Religion, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
where Persons are not able to find sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in those that are <hi>purely spiritual,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
great intention of mind and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in their Exercise; so were they many of
them easily infected by that Tincture which
remained in them from the <hi>Judaisme</hi> or <hi>Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lism</hi>
from which they were converted. But
these observances were <hi>free,</hi> and taken up by
Men of their own <hi>accord;</hi> not only every
Church, but every Person, in the most of
them, as far as it appears, being left unto
their own Liberty. Some <hi>Ages</hi> it was before
such things were turned into Laws and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons;</hi>
and that perhaps first by <hi>Hereticks,</hi> or
at least under such a Degeneracy, as our
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:57351:99"/>
minds and Consciences cannot be regulated
by. The Judgment therefore and Practice
of the <hi>first Churches</hi> are manifest against such
Impositions.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, upon a supposition that it should
be Lawful for any Persons or Churches to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
<hi>unscriptural Conditions</hi> of their Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it will follow, that there is no <hi>certain Rule
of Communion</hi> amongst Christians fixed and
determined by Christ. That this is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
we have before declared, and shall now
only manifest the evil Consequences of such a
Supposition. For if it be so, no Man can
claim an <hi>Admission</hi> into the Society or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of any Church, or a Participation in
the Ordinances of the Gospel with them, by
vertue of the <hi>Authority</hi> of Jesus Christ. For
notwithstanding all his Pleas, of submission
to his Institutions, and the <hi>Observation of his
Commands,</hi> every Church may propose some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
yea many things unto him, that he
hath not appointed, without an admission
whereof, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d subjection thereunto, he may
be <hi>justly excluded</hi> from all Church Priviledges
among them. Now this seems not consonant
unto the Authority that Christ hath over the
Church, nor that Honour which ought to be
given unto him therein. Nor on the same
supposition are his Laws sufficient to rule and
quiet the <hi>Consciences,</hi> or to provide for the
Edification of his Disciples. Now if <hi>Diotre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes</hi>
is blamed, for not receiving the <hi>Brethren,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Joh. 9, 10.</note>
who were <hi>recommended</hi> unto the Church by
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:57351:99"/>
the Apostle, probably because they would not
submit to that <hi>pre-eminence</hi> which he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
among them; they will scarcely escape
without reproof, who refuse those whom the
Lord Christ commends unto them by the
<hi>Rules of the Gospel,</hi> because they will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
unto such new Impositions as by vertue of
their <hi>Pre-eminence</hi> they would put upon them.
And what endless Perplexities they must be
cast into, who have learned in these things to
call him <hi>only Lord and Master,</hi> is apparent
unto all. Baptism, with a voluntary credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>Profession</hi> of Faith, Repentance and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
unto the Lord Christ in his Commands
and Institutions, is all the warranty which
he hath given unto any of his Disciples, to
claim their Admission into his Churches,
which are instituted and appointed to receive
them, and to build them up in their Faith.
And if any Person who produceth this <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty,</hi>
and thereon desireth, according to
order, the Communion of any Church; if
he may be excluded from it, or forbidden an
entrance into it, unless it be on grounds suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
in the Judgment of Charity to evince
the falseness and hypocrisie of his Profession,
little regard is had to the Authority of Christ,
and too much unto Mens own. Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
may more or less insist upon the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citness
of this <hi>Profession,</hi> and the Evidences
of its sincerity, as they find it tend to their
Peace and Edification, with a due Attendance
unto the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> left unto them in
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57351:100"/>
this matter, in the Gospel. And that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of this Power in any Churches may not
turn to the <hi>Prejudice</hi> of any, every Professor
is allowed, with reference unto particular As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
to make his choice of the <hi>Measure</hi>
he will comply withal; at least if he will
make the choice of his habitation subservient
unto his Edification. Hereby the Peace and
Duty, both of Churches and private Persons
are secured. And this Rule of Church Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
and Communion, furnished Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
with Peace, Love and Unity for <hi>many
Ages,</hi> setting aside the <hi>Ruffle</hi> given them in
the rashness of <hi>Victor</hi> before mentioned. It
was also rendred <hi>practicable</hi> and easie, by
vertue of their Communion as Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselves: For from thence, <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory
Letters,</hi> supplyed the Room of
actual Profession in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m who having been
admitted into one Church, did desire the
same Priviledge in any other. And on this
Rule were Persons to be received, though
<hi>weak in the Faith,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ro. 14. 1.</note> thought it may be in some
things <hi>otherwise minded</hi> than the generality of
the Church,<note place="margin">Phil. 3. 15.</note> though <hi>babes, and unskilful,</hi> as
to degrees,<note place="margin">He. 5. 12 13, 14.</note> in the word of Truth. But this
Rule was alwayes attended with a Proviso,
that men did not contradict, or destroy their
own Profession by an unholy Conversation:
For such Persons never were, nor ever are to
be admitted unto the especial Ordinances of
the Church; and a neglect of due Attendance
hereunto, is that which principally hath cast
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:57351:100"/>
us into all our Confusions, and rendred the
Institutions of Christ ineffectual. And if this
<hi>warranty</hi> which the Lord Christ hath given
unto his Disciples, of claiming a Participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in all the Priviledges of his Churches, and
an Admission unto a joynt-performance of all
the Duties required in them, may, upon the
supposition of a Power left to <hi>impose other
Conditions</hi> of Communion on them, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
and rendred useless, all Church Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
is absolutely resolved into the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
wills of Men. The Church no doubt may
judge and determine upon the <hi>Laws of Christ,</hi>
and their due Application unto particular
Occasions; as whether such Persons may
according to them be admitted into their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship.
To deprive Churches of this Litber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is to take away their Principal Use and
service. But to <hi>make Laws of their own,</hi> the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
matter whereof shall be things not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Christ, &amp; to make them the <hi>Rule</hi>
of admitting professed Christians unto their
Communion, is an Assumption that cannot be
justified. And it is certain, that the assuming of
an Authority by some Churches for such like
Impositions, is that which hath principally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned
many to deny them <hi>so to be;</hi> so at
once to overthrow the foundation of all that
Authority, which in so many Instances they
find to be abused. And although the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> may prevail on weak and credulous
Persons, by proposing unto them an absolute
Acquiescency in their Dictates and Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:57351:101"/>
as the best, readiest and most facile
means of satisfaction; yet there is nothing
that doth more alienate wise and conscientious
persons from them, than doth that unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Proposal, Moreover, it is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that <hi>endless Disputes</hi> will arise on this
supposition, about what is <hi>meet and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi>
and what not, to be added unto the
Scripture-Rules of Communion. They have
done so in the Ages past, and continue yet so
to do. Nor can any man on this Principle
know, or probably conjecture, when he hath
a <hi>firm station</hi> in the Church, or an indefensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
interest in the Priviledges thereof. For
supposing that he hath concocted the <hi>Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of one Church,</hi> on the first removal of his
habitation, he may have new conditions of
communion prescribed unto him. And from
this perplexity nothing can relieve him, but a
resolution to do in every place whereunto he
may come, according to the <hi>manner of the
place,</hi> beit good or bad, right or wrong. But
neither hath the Lord Christ left his Disciples
at this <hi>Vncertainty</hi> which the Case supposeth;
nor will accept of that <hi>Indifferency</hi> which is
in the Remedy suggested. They therefore
who regulate their Communion with any
Churches, by the firm stated Law of their
Right and Priviledge, if they are not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thereon, do not by their <hi>abstinence</hi> from
it, contract the Guilt of Schisme or any bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meable
Division.</p>
            <p>Moreover, upon a supposition of such a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:57351:101" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Power to prescribe and impose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written
conditions of Church-communion
on Christians, who, or what Law doth, or
shall prescribe <hi>bounds</hi> unto men, that they
do not proceed in their Prescriptions, beyond
what is useful unto edification, or unto what
will be really burdensome and intolerable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Churches. To say that those who claim
this <hi>Power</hi> may be securely trusted with it,
for they will be sure not to fall into any such
Excesses, will scarcely give satisfaction: For
besides that such a kind of Power is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
apt to swell and extend it self <hi>unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surably,</hi>
the common Experience of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
lies against this Suggestion. Was not an
Excess of this kind complained of by <hi>Austin</hi>
of old, when yet the observation of <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Customes</hi> was much more voluntary
than in after Ages; neither were they made
absolutely conditions of communion, unless
among a very few? Do not all <hi>Protestants</hi>
grant and plead that the <hi>Papal Church</hi> hath
exceeded all bounds of moderation and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
herein; so that from thence they take
the principal warranty of their secession
from it? Do not other Churches mutually
charge one another on the same account?
Hath not a charge of this <hi>Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ss</hi> been the
Ball of Contention in this Nation ever since
the Reformation? If then there be such a
Power in any, either the exercise of it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
unto certain Instances by some power
<hi>superior</hi> unto them. or it is left absolutely, as
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:57351:102"/>
unto all Particulars whereunto it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
unto their own Prudence and Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The first will not be asserted, nor can
be so, unless the Instances intended can be
recounted, and the <hi>confirming power</hi> be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
If the latter be affirmed, then let them
run into what <hi>Excesses</hi> they please, unless
they judge themselves that so they do, which
is morally impossible that they should, none
ought ever to complain of what they do: For
there is no failure in them who attend unto
<hi>their Rule;</hi> which in this case is supposed to
be mens own Prudence and Discretion. And
this was directly the state of things in the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> whence they thought it
alwayes exceedingly unequal that any of their
<hi>Ecclesiastical Laws</hi> should be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion;
since they made them according to
their own Judgment, the sole Rule of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
their Authority in such things. Where
is the certainty and stability of this Rule?
Is it probable that the communion and peace
of all Churches, and all Christians, are left
to be regulated by it? And who will give
assurance, that no <hi>one Condition</hi> directly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
in it self shall be prescribed and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by persons enjoying this pretended pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
Or who can undertake that the number of
such Conditions as may be countenanced by
a Plea of being things in their own nature <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi>
shall not be increased until they come
to be such a burden and yoke, as are too heavy
for the Disciples of Christ to bear, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
for them to submit themselves unto?
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:57351:102"/>
May any make a Judgment but themselves,
who impose them, when the number of such
things grows to a blameable excess? If others
may judge, at least for themselves, &amp; their own
practice, and so of what is lawful or not, it
is all that is desired. If themselves are the
the <hi>only Judges,</hi> the case seems very hard,
and our secession from the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>
scarcely warrantable. And who sees not
what endless Contests and Differences will
ensue on these Suppositions, if the whole
Liberty of mens Judgments, and all appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of Duty in Professors, be not swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up in the Gulph of <hi>Atheistical Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,</hi>
as to all the Concerns of outward
worship.</p>
            <p>The whole of what hath been pleaded on
this Head, might be confirmed with the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of many of the Learned writers of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the defence of our
Secession from that of <hi>Rome.</hi> But we shall
not here produce them in particular. The sum
of what is pleaded by them, is, <hi>That the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Catholick Church lies in Essentials;
that for a particular Church to disagree from
all other particular Churches in some extrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
and accidental things, is not to separate
from the Catholick Church, so as to cease to be
a Church; but still whatever Church makes
such extrinsecal things the necessary conditions
of Communion, so as to cast men out of the
Church, who yield not to them, is Schismatical
in its so doing, and the Separation from it is so
far from being Schisme, that being cast out of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:57351:103"/>
that Church on those terms only, returns them
unto the Communion of the Catholick Church.
And nothing can be more unreasonable, than
that the Society imposing such conditions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
should be Judge whether those conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
be just and equitable or no.</hi> To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
do they generally plead our common
Cause. Wherefore, from what hath been
discoursed, we doubt not but to affirm, that
where <hi>unscriptural conditions</hi> of communion,
indispensibly to be submitted unto and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
are by any Church imposed on those
whom they expect or require to joyn in their
Fellowship, Communion and Order; if they
on whom they are so imposed, do thereon
with-hold or withdraw themselves from the
<hi>communion of that Church,</hi> especially in the
Acts, Duties and Parts of Worship, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a submission unto these conditions is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed
either <hi>verbally</hi> or <hi>virtually,</hi> they are
not thereon to be esteemed guilty of <hi>Schisme;</hi>
but the whole fault of the Divisions which
ensue thereon, is to be charged on them who
insist on the necessity of their Imposition.</p>
            <p>That this is the condition of things with us
at present, especially such as are <hi>Ministers of
the Gospel,</hi> with reference unto the <hi>Church of
England,</hi> as it is known in its self, so it may
be evidenced unto all, by an enumeration of
the <hi>Particulars</hi> that are required of us, if we
will be comprehended in the Communion and
Fellowship thereof.</p>
            <p>For 1. It is indispensibly enjoyned that we
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:57351:103"/>
give <hi>a solemn Attestation unto the Liturgy, and
all contained in it, by the subscription or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of our Assent and Consent thereunto;</hi>
which must be accompanied with the constant
use of it in the whole Worship of God. As
was before observed, we dispute not now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of the use of <hi>Liturgies,</hi>
in the publick Service of the Church; nor
of that in particular which is established a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us by the Laws of the Land. Were it
only proposed, or recommended unto Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
for the use of it in whole or in part, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as it should be found needful unto the
edification of their people, there would be a
great <hi>Alteration</hi> in the case under considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And if it be pretended, that such a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
would produce great diversity, yea and
confusion in the Worship of God, we can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
say, that it did not so of old, when the
Pastors of Churches were left wholly to the
exercise of their own <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Abilities</hi> in all
Sacred Administrations. But it is the making
of an Assent and Consent unto it, with the
constant use of it, or attendance unto it, a
<hi>necessary condition</hi> of all Communion with the
Church, which at present is called into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.
It will not, we suppose, be denied, but
that it is so made unto us all, both Ministers and
People; and that by such Laws both <hi>Civil</hi>
and <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> as are sufficiently severe in
their Penalties. For we have Rules and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of Church-communion assigned unto
us, by <hi>Laws</hi> meerly <hi>Civil.</hi> Were there any
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57351:104"/>
colour or pretence of denying this to be so,
we should proceed no farther in this Instance;
but things are evidently and openly with us
as here laid down. Now this <hi>condition of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi>
is <hi>unscriptural;</hi> and the making of it
to be such a condition, is without warranty
or countenance from the word of God, or
the practice of the Apostolical and Primitive
Churches. That there are no footsteps of
any <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or prescribed Forms for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of all Church-Ordinances to be
imposed on the the Disciples of Christ in their
Assemblies, to be found in the Scripture, no
intimation of any such thing, no direction
about it, no command for it, will, we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
be acknowledged.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 1.</note> Commanded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we are to <hi>make Prayers</hi> and supplications
for all sorts of men in our Assemblies, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 28.</note>
lead, guide, and feed the Flock of
Christ, to administer the holy Ordinances
instituted by him,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 2.</note> and to do all these things
<hi>decently and in order.</hi> The Apostles also descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
the work of the Ministry in their own
attendance unto it, affirm that they would
<hi>give themselves continually unto Prayer and the
Ministry of the Word.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 6. 4.</note> But that all these
things should be done (the Preaching of the
word only excepted) in and by the use or
reading of a Liturgy, and the prescribed
Forms of it, without variation or receding
from the Words and Syllables of it in any
thing, that the Scripture is utterly silent of.
If any one be otherwise minded, it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:57351:104"/>
on him to produce Instances unto his
purpose. But withall he must remember,
that in this case it is required not only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a <hi>warranty</hi> from the Scripture for the
use of such Forms or <hi>Liturgies,</hi> but also that
Rules are given therein, enabling Churches
to make the constant attendance unto them, to
be a necessary condition of their communion.
If this be not done, nothing is offered unto
the Case as at present stated. And whatever
confidence may be made use of herein, we
know that nothing unto this purpose can be
thence produced. It is pleaded indeed that
our Saviour himself composed a <hi>Form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
and prescribed it unto his Disciples: But
it is not proved that he enjoyned them the
<hi>constant use</hi> of it in their <hi>Assemblies,</hi> nor that
they did so use it, nor that the repetition of
it should be a <hi>condition of communion</hi> in them,
though the owning of it as by him proposed,
and for the Ends by him designed, may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be made so; least of all is it, or can it be
proved, that any Rule or just encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can hence be taken for other men, who
are neither <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> nor his <hi>Apostles,</hi> but
weak and fallible as our selves, to compose
entire <hi>Liturgies,</hi> and impose the necessary
use of them in all the worship of the
Church.</p>
            <p>Neither is there the least countenance to be
obtained unto such Impositions, from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise
or example of the <hi>first Churches.</hi> Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
themselves were an Invention of after-Ages,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:57351:105"/>
and the <hi>use</hi> of them now enquired after
of a much later date. For those which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto <hi>Apostolical antiquity,</hi> have long since
been convicted to be spurious and feigned:
Nor is there scarce any Learned man who
hath the confidence to assert them to be genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine.
And on a supposition that <hi>so they are,</hi> no
tollerable reason can be given why the use of
them should be neglected, and such others
taken up as are of a most uncertain Original.
The first condition therefore of communion
proposed unto us, is not only <hi>unscriptural,</hi>
which is sufficient unto our present Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but also destitute of any ancient Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
or Usuage among the Churches of
Christ, to give countenance unto it. This if
we admit not of, if we attend not unto,
we are not only <hi>refused communion</hi> in
other things, but also <hi>excommunicated,</hi>
or cast out of the whole communion of
the Church, as many are at this day; yea
some are so, not only for refusing compliance
with the whole of it in general; but for not
observing every particular Direction belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto it (as might be manifested in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances)
of no great importance. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any Divisions or <hi>Schismes</hi> do ensue among
us on this account; that some indispensibly
require an <hi>Assent</hi> and <hi>Consent</hi> unto the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy,</hi>
and all things contained in it, as the
condition of compleat Church-communion,
or a necessary <hi>attendance</hi> on the whole Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
worship thereby performed, and therein
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:57351:105"/>
prescribed, which others refuse to admit of
as such, and thereon <hi>forbear the communion</hi>
proposed unto them, it is evident from the
Rules laid down, where the guilt of them is
to be charged. And we do not discourse of
what any may do among themselves, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it meet for their <hi>edification,</hi> nor of what
a <hi>Civil Law</hi> may constitute with respect unto
publick places, Employments and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but only where lies the lin, and evil,
that attends <hi>Divisions</hi> arising on these Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
and which, by their removal, would
be taken away. And there seems to be an
aggravation of this <hi>Disorder,</hi> in that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
all men are refused <hi>communion,</hi> who will not
submit unto these Terms of it; but also they
are <hi>sought out</hi> and exposed unto severe Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
if they will not admit of them, though
expresly contrary to their Consciences and
Perswasions.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Canonical Submission</hi> unto the present
Ecclesiastical Government of the Church,
and the Administration of the Discipline
thereof, in their hands by whom the Power
of it is possessed, with an Acquiescency
therein, are to the same purpose required of
us, and expected from us. Who these are,
and what are the Wayes and Means of their
Administrations, we shall not repeat, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to give offence unto any. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but know <hi>how,</hi> and in <hi>what sense</hi> these
things are proposed unto us, and what
is expected from us thereon. Neither dare
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:57351:106"/>
we give <hi>another sense</hi> of them in our minds,
than what we judge to be the sense and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them who require our submission and
obedience unto them. It is not certainly
their design nor mind, that we should look on
the <hi>Offices</hi> of the Church as <hi>unwarrantable,</hi>
and on their Rule as inconvenient, so as to
endeavour a <hi>Reformation</hi> in the one, and of
the other. It is such a conformity they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
as whereby we do, <hi>virtually</hi> at least, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
our approbation of all these things in
the Church, and our acquiescency in them.
Neither can we be admitted to put in any <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi>
nor discharge our Consciences by a
plain Declaration of what we dislike or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
from, or in what sense we can submit
unto any of these things. We take it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
for granted, that in the conformity
required of us, we must cordially and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
approve the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>esent Ecclesiastical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and the Administration of
Church-Discipline thereby. For it is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our <hi>Acceptance</hi> of it, as proposed
unto us; and if we acquiesce not therein,
but express an uneasiness under it, we do it
at the hazard of the Reputation of our Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
and Honesty in conforming. Now
this condition of communion with the <hi>Church
of England,</hi> is also <hi>unscriptural;</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
unlawful to be made so. This is by
many now plainly acknowledged: For
they say there is <hi>no Government</hi> determined
in the Scripture. But this now in force
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57351:106"/>
amongst us, is erected by the Authority of
the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> who hath <hi>supream power</hi> in
things Ecclesiastical: And on that ground a
<hi>lawful Government</hi> they plead it to be, and
lawful to be exercised, and so also by others
to be submitted to. But we have now sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
times declared that this is not our present
Question. We enquire not whether it be
<hi>Lawful</hi> or no, or on what account it may be
so esteemed, or how far it may be submitted
unto, or wherein: But we say the professed
acknowledging of it with submission unto it,
as the <hi>Government of the Church,</hi> is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of us as a necessary condition of our
communion. If they are not so give us liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to declare our sense concerning it, without
prejudice. And if it be so, then may we
refuse this condition, as <hi>unscrptural.</hi> For
in the case of Conformity, there is not only a
submission to the Government required, but
expresly (as was said) an approbation of it,
that it is such as it ought to be. For in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
things our <hi>practise</hi> declares a cordial
approbation; as being a part of our Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
wherein we ought to be sincere. Some
again make some Pleas, that <hi>Bishops,</hi> and
some Government by them, are appointed
by the Apostles; and therefore a submission
unto them may be justly required as a <hi>conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of communion.</hi> For we will not now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute,
but that whatever is so <hi>appointed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> may
be so <hi>required;</hi> although we believe that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular Instance of this nature, is not
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57351:107"/>
rigidly to be insisted on, if it belong not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Essentials of the Church, and it be
<hi>dubious</hi> to some whether it be so appointed or
no. But yet neither doth an admittance of
this <hi>Plea,</hi> give us any relief in this matter.
For suppose it should or might be proved,
that there ought to be, according to the mind
of Christ in all Churches, <hi>Bishops</hi> with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence
above <hi>Presbyters</hi> in Order or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
and that the Rule of the Church doth
principally belong unto them that are so; yet
will not this Concession bear an application
to the present Question, so as to afford us
any Relief. For the granting of things so <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious</hi>
and <hi>questionable,</hi> can never give them
such an evidence of Truth and firmitude in
the Church, as to warrant the making of
them <hi>necessary conditions</hi> of communion unto
all Christians. Neither doth it follow from
any thing that pretendeth to fall under Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-proof,
that such Bishops should be <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan;</hi>
that they should depend on <hi>Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>
over them; that they should assume the
whole power of Church-Rule and Discipline
into their hands; that they should admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
it by <hi>Chancellors, Archdeacons, Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
and the like; that this should be done
by Presentments, or <hi>Indictments,</hi> Citations,
Processes, Litigious Pleadings, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Secular or Civil Courts,</hi> to the Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of that Rule and Discipline which the
Gospel directs unto, with the management
of it in Love and Brotherly compassion in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57351:107"/>
the Name and by the Spirit of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ. But these things we shall not in
particular insist upon, for the Reason before
given. This we must say, that take the
<hi>whole of the Government,</hi> and the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof together, which by the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
required of us we must testifie our <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation</hi>
of, and Acquiescence in, or we deal
hypocritically with them that require it of
us; and we know it to be so far <hi>unscriptural,</hi>
as that an acknowledgment of it, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
unto it, cannot duly and justly be
made a <hi>necessary condition</hi> of communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us. It may be it will be said, that <hi>submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
unto the Government of the Church,</hi> is not
so much a condition of communion with it,
as it is that wherein our <hi>communion it self</hi> with
it, doth consist; and it is but a Fancy to think
of communion with a Church without it.
But this is otherwise; as appears in those
Churches where all Rule and Government
being left in the hand of the <hi>Civil Magistrate,</hi>
there communion is meerly spiritual in the
Administration of Evangelical Ordinances.
And might but that be admitted, which, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Reason, the Law of the Christian
Faith, and Gospel-Obedience, do require,
namely, that Church-fellowship and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
be built upon mens <hi>own Judgment and
Choyce;</hi> and this would go a great way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the pacification of our Differences.
But if this be so, and that all Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
consists in <hi>submission to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:57351:108"/>
of it, or at least that it doth so princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally,
it becomes them by whom it is owned
and avowed so to do, to take care, that, that
<hi>Government</hi> be derived from the Authority
of Christ, and administred according to his
Mind, or all <hi>Church Communion,</hi> properly so
called, will be overthrown.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, We are required to use and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in Worship which the
present Church hath appointed, or doth use
and observe. This also is made a <hi>necessary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi>
of Communion unto us. For many are
at this day actually cast out of all Communion
for not observing of them. Some are so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
against for not observing of <hi>Holy dayes;</hi>
some for not <hi>Kneeling at the Sacrament</hi> of the
Lords Supper<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some for not using the <hi>Sign of
the Cross</hi> in Baptism; and what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of Ministers that should neglect or omit
to wear the <hi>Surplice</hi> in Sacred Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
is easie to conjecture. But these things
are all of them unwritten and <hi>unscriptural.</hi>
Great and many indeed have been the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
of learned men, to prove that although
they have no Divine Institution, nor yet exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of Apostolical or Primitive practise, yet
that they may be <hi>Lawfully used</hi> for <hi>Decency
and Order</hi> in the Worship of God. Whether
they have evinced what they aimed at, is as yet
undetermined. But supposing in this Case all
to be as they would pretend, and plead that it
should be, yet because they are all granted to
be <hi>Arbitrary inventions of men,</hi> and very few
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57351:108"/>
of those who make use of them are agreed
what is their proper use and signification, or
whether they have any or no, they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
unmeet to be made a <hi>necessary condition</hi> of
Communion. For enquiry may be made, on
what Warranty, or by what Rule they may
be appointed so to be? Those who preside in,
and over the Churches of Christ, do so in his
Name, and by his Authority. And therefore
they can <hi>impose nothing</hi> on them as a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Communion together, but what his
Name is upon, or what they have his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
for: And it will be dangerous to set his
<hi>Seal</hi> unto our own Appointments. For what
men think meet to do <hi>themselves</hi> in the matters
of the House of God and his Worship, it may
be measured and accepted with him according
to their Light and Design. But for what they
<hi>impose on others,</hi> and that under no less penalty
than the deprivation of the outward Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of all the Priviledges procured for
them by Jesus Christ, they ought to have his
Warrant and Authority for. And their Zeal
is to be <hi>bewailed,</hi> who not only cast men out
of all Church Communion, so far as in them
lyeth, for a refusal to observe those <hi>voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imposed Ceremonies</hi> in sacred Worship, but
also prosecute them with outward force to
the Ruine of them and their Families; and
we cannot but wonder that any should as yet
think meet to make use of <hi>Prisons,</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of men thereby, as an <hi>Appendix</hi> of
their Ecclesiastical Discipline, exercised in
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57351:109"/>
the highest severity, on no greater Occasions
than the omission of the observance of these
Ceremonies. Whether such proceedings are
measured by <hi>present Inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>est,</hi> or the due consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of what will be pleasing to the Lord
Jesus Christ at the last day, is not difficult to
determine.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, As we are <hi>Ministers</hi> there is in
some cases required of us under the same pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
an <hi>Oath of Canonical obedience.</hi> We
need not labour to prove this to be <hi>unscriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral;</hi>
nor, to avoid provocations, shall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
declare the Rise, Nature and Use of it,
with the fierce Digladiations that have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been about it. We can look upon it no
otherwise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as that which is contrary to
the Liberty, and unworthy of the Office of a
Minister of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>We know not any thing else which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us unto the end mentioned, unless it
be of some a <hi>Subscription unto the Articles of
Religion.</hi> And this, because the Scripture en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
unto all a <hi>Consent</hi> unto sound Doctrine,
and a <hi>Form of wholsome words,</hi> may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
so far as those Articles concern only
Points of Faith; But whereas there is annexed
unto them, and enjoyned with other things,
an <hi>Approbation</hi> of all those Instances of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Communion, before insisted on, a
<hi>Subscription</hi> unto the whole becomes of the
same Nature with the things themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
approved of.</p>
            <p>These are the <hi>Conditions of Communion</hi> with
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:57351:109"/>
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which are proposed
unto us, and which we are indispensibly to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we intend to be partakers thereof;
and these are all which we know, of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
That any of these are in particular <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in the Word of God,</hi> much less that they
can derive any Warranty from thence to be
made <hi>necessary conditions of Church-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
will not we suppose be pretended by any.
If therefore any <hi>Divisions</hi> do ensue on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusal
of some to admit of these Conditions, the
<hi>Guilt</hi> of them cannot by any Rule of Scripture,
or from any example of the first Churches, be
charged on them who make that refusal. Other
groundless Accusations and Charges we value
not; for this is but <hi>Mans Day,</hi> the Judgment
whereof we neither stand nor fall unto. Yea,
we esteem our selves obliged, in all peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and sobriety to <hi>bear witness</hi> against such
impositions, and unto that Liberty wherewith
the Lord Christ hath made his Churches and
Disciples free. And if once things were come
unto that state, that men would assign no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Terms of Church Communion,</hi> than what
Christ hath appointed, it would quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
where the guilt of our Divisions would
remain, if any such Divisions would yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.
But so long as there is a desire to make
the Wills and Wisdomes of some men, fallible
even as others, the <hi>Rule</hi> and measure of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
in spiritual things, an end of strife and
contention among Christians, will be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in vain. And this we say, with hearts in
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57351:110"/>
some measure sensible, and pained, to see the
<hi>Body of Christ</hi> torn in pieces by the lusts, passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and carnal interests of men. Could we
contribute any thing to the healing of the
Wounds and Ruptures that are amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
provided it may have a <hi>consistency</hi> with
the mind of Christ, aud the Duty we owe unto
him, (as indeed nothing else will really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
any thing thereunto) we should with
all readiness and faithfulness give up our best
endeavours therein. And where we can do
nothing else, we hope we shall bear with <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience</hi>
those disdainful Reproaches which the
<hi>Pride of men</hi> blown up by a confluence of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
perishing advantages, prompts them to
pour out upon us, for our non-compliance
with their Impositions.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By the <hi>Conformity</hi> required of
us, we must consent unto the <hi>Omission of sundry
Duties,</hi> which are made so unto us by the
Command and Appointment of Jesus Christ.
If we are at any time <hi>hindred</hi> in the discharge
of any necessary Duty by others, we have
somwhat to plead in our own excuse: But if
we our selves <hi>voluntarily</hi> consent to the neglect
or omission of them, we cannot avoyd the guilt
of sin. And the worst way whereby such a
consent may be expressed, is by <hi>compact</hi> and
agreement with others; as though it were in
our Power to <hi>bargain</hi> with other men, what
Duties we will observe, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d what we will omit
in the Worship of God. Now in the <hi>Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
required of us, we are to give this consent,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57351:110"/>
and that as it were by Compact and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which deprives us of all pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
in our omissions. It is no time afterward
to plead that we <hi>would discharge such Duties,</hi>
were we not hindred or forbidden. We have
our selves antecedently and <hi>voluntarily</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
a concern in such forbidden Duties.
For no man can <hi>honestly conform,</hi> but it is with
a declared Resolution to accept of all the
Terms and Consequents of it, with an Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
of them. Under this Notion it is, that
we look on Conformity; and what others ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
thereby, or understand therein, who
seem to press men to <hi>conform</hi> unto what they
do not <hi>approve,</hi> we know not. If then there be
any omission of known Duties inseparably
accompanying our <hi>Conformity,</hi> that thereby
we solemnly consent unto.</p>
            <p>This therefore we are obliged to <hi>refuse,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
without sin in the <hi>voluntary</hi> neglect and
omission of Duty, we cannot comply with it;
which therefore can be no <hi>Schism</hi> in us, nor
what might in any way render us blameable.
The Lord Christ hath prescribed no such Law
of <hi>Vnity and Peace</hi> unto his Churches, as that
his Disciples should be bound constantly to
neglect any <hi>known</hi> Duty, which they owe to
himself for their sakes. Nor do his Institutions
interfere, that the observance of any one,
should exclude a due attendance unto another.
Neither doth he by his commands, bring any
one into a necessity of doing that which is
evil, or of <hi>omitting</hi> any thing that is required
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57351:111"/>
of him in the way of Duty. However there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we value Church-Peace and Union, we
dare not purchase it, by an <hi>Abrenunciation</hi>
of any Duty we owe to Jesus Christ, nor
would an Agreement procured on such
Terms be of any use unto us, or of advantage
to the Church its self. Wherefore that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance
in Church communion which would
be obstructive of any <hi>necessary Dutyes,</hi> is not by
the Lord Christ enjoyned us, and therefore its
omission cannot be culpable in us, but it would
its self be our sin: Especially would it be
thus, where the Duties so to be omitted, are
such as are incumbent on us, by virtue of <hi>espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Office,</hi> wherein we are peculiarly required
to be faithful. It remaineth therefore only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that we declare wherein we should by <hi>confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>
engage unto the omission of such Duties
as are indispensibly required of us. And this
we shall do in some few Instances.</p>
            <p>(1) Every Minister of the Gospel hath by
the Appointment of Jesus Christ, the <hi>whole
immediate Care</hi> of the Flock, whereof he is
<hi>Overseer,</hi> committed unto him. That no part
hereof which belongs unto their Edification
is exempted from him,<note place="margin">Acts 20. 17. 28.</note> the <hi>Charge</hi> that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
unto him, and the <hi>Account</hi> which will
be expected from him,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 5.</note> do sufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
For as Ministers are called <hi>Overseers,
Rulers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>Guides, Pastors,</hi> and the like; so are
they commanded to <hi>feed the Flock,</hi> to <hi>take the
Oversight of it,</hi> and to <hi>Rule the House of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 17.</note>
a discharge of all which must come into their
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:57351:111"/>
Account. Nor is there any word spoken in
the whole Scripture, relating to the Rule and
Government of the Church, which is not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
principally with respect unto them. Nor
is there the least Intimation of an <hi>Exemption</hi>
of any <hi>Part</hi> of the Discipline of the Gospel,
from their Office or Care. If it be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that there is, let the Places be produced
wherein such an Exemption is made, or any
Instances of it among the first Churches, and
they shall be considered; for hitherto no such
thing hath been attempted, that we know of.
Nor is it at all concluded, from the Plea, that
some are appointed unto a <hi>Superior Degree</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
others in the Rule of the Church. For a
man may have the <hi>whole Rule</hi> of his Flock
committed unto him, although he should be
obliged to give an Account unto others of his
Discharge thereof. It is therefore the Duty
of all Ministers of the Gospel, not only to
to Teach, Instruct and Preach to their Flocks,
but to go before them also in <hi>Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
and in the Exercise of the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Discipline appointed in the Gospel, in
the Order wherein it is appointed for their
Edification. The <hi>keys of the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
are committed unto them, or they are not:
If they are not, by what Authority do they
take upon them to <hi>open and shut</hi> in the House
of God, in Ministerial teaching, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative
Administration of sacred Ordinances?
For these things belong unto the Authority
which is given by Christ under the <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical</hi>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:57351:112"/>
Expression of the <hi>Keys of the Kingdom
of Heaven;</hi> the Reason of the Allusion and
its Application, being obvious. And if these
are not received by any, they are Usurpers,
if they undertake to administer unto the
Church <hi>authoritatively</hi> in the Name of Jesus
Christ. If they are given or granted unto
them, how may it be made to appear that
they are so, for the <hi>Ends mentioned only,</hi> but
not for the Rule and Government of the
Church, which also belongs unto them?
where is the Exception in the grant made to
them? where are the Limits assigned unto
their <hi>Power,</hi> that they shall exercise it in
some concerns of the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> but
not in others? And whereas the greatest and
most necessary Parts of this Power, such as
are Ministerial Teaching, and the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the Sacraments, are confessedly
committed unto them, how comes it to pass
that the <hi>less</hi> should be reserved from them?
For whereas the former are necessary to the
very <hi>Being</hi> of the Church, the latter are estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by some scarcely to belong unto it. To
say that <hi>Bishops</hi> only receive these <hi>Keys,</hi> and
commit or lend the Use of them to others, for
such Ends and Purposes as they are pleased
to Limit, is both forreign to the Scripture, and
destructive of all <hi>Ministerial</hi> Power. And if
Ministers are not the Ministers of Christ, but
of Men; if they have not their Authority
from him, but from others; if that may be
<hi>parcelled</hi> out unto them which they have from
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57351:112"/>
him, at the Pleasure of any over them, there
needs not much contending about them or
their Office.</p>
            <p>Besides, the <hi>Relation</hi> of these things one
to another is such, as that if they are abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
separated, their Efficacy unto Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will be exceedingly impaired, if not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.
If those who have the Dispensation
of the word committed unto them, have not
Liberty and Authority; if it be not part of
their <hi>Office,</hi> Duty, to <hi>watch over them</hi> unto
whom it is dispensed, and that accompanyed
with Spiritual weapons, <hi>Mighty through God,</hi>
towards the fulfilling of the Obedience of
some, and the <hi>revenging of Disobedience</hi> in
others; if they have no Power to Judge, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish
or Censure them that walk unanswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
to the Doctrine of the Gospel preached
unto them, and whose Profession they have
taken upon them; they will be discouraged
in the pursuit of their work, and the Word it
self be deprived of an helpful Means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
by Christ himself to farther its Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.
And those who shall content themselves
with the <hi>Preaching of the Word only,</hi> without
an Enquiry after its Success in the Minds and
Lives of them that are committed to their
Charge, by virtue of that Care and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative
Inspection which indeed belongs to
their Office, will find that as they do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
but <hi>one Part</hi> of their Duty, so they
will grow cold and Languid therein also. And
when there hath been better Success, as there
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57351:113"/>
hath, where some against their wills have been
hindred by Power from the Exercise of the
<hi>Charge</hi> laid on them by Christ in this matter,
making up as they were able by <hi>private Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude</hi>
and Perswasion, what they were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from attending unto in publick Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
Acts, it hath been an Effect of especial
favour from God, not to be ordinarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
on the account of any Rule. And
thence it is, that for the most part things open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and visibly do fall out otherwise; the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
being little reformed in their Lives, and
<hi>Preachers</hi> waxing cold and formal in their
work. And if the <hi>Censures</hi> of the Church,
are administred by them who preach not the
Word unto the People, they will be weak and
enervous as unto any Influence on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of Men. Their minds indeed may be
affected by them, so far as they are attended
with <hi>outward Penalties;</hi> but how little this
tends unto the Promotion of Holiness, or the
Reformation of Mens Lives, Experience doth
abundantly testifie. Church Discipline and
Censures are appointed merely and solely, to
<hi>second, confirm,</hi> and establish the word, and
to vindicate it from abuse and contempt, as
expressing the sense that Jesus Christ hath of
<hi>them</hi> by whom it is received, and of <hi>them</hi> by
whom it is despised. And it is the word alone
which gives Authority unto <hi>Discipline</hi> and
Censures. Where therefore they are so <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated,</hi>
as that those by whom the Word is
administred, are excluded from an Interest in
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57351:113"/>
the Exercise of Discipline; and those unto
whom the Administration of Discipline is
committed, are such as neither do, nor for
the most part ought to preach the word, it
cannot be, but that the Efficacy and success
of them both will be impeded.</p>
            <p>It is so also as to the Administration of the
<hi>Sacraments,</hi> especially that of the <hi>Supper of
the Lord.</hi> These are the principal Mysteries
of our Religion, as to its external Form and
Administration; the Sacred <hi>Rites</hi> whereby
all the Grace, Mercy, and Priviledges of the
Gospel are sealed and confirmed unto them
who are in a due manner made partakers of
them. About them therefore, and their
orderly Administration, did the <hi>Primitive
Church</hi> alwayes use their utmost care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence:
And these in an especial manner did
they make use of, with respect unto <hi>them,</hi> to
whom they were to be communicated. For
they feared, partly, lest men should be made
<hi>partakers of them</hi> to their disadvantage, being
not so qualified, as to receive them to their
benefit; as knowing, that where persons
through their own defaults, obtain not <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
profit</hi> by them, they are in no small
danger of having them turned into a Snare;
and partly, that these holy and sacred Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
themselves might neither be prophaned,
contaminated, nor exposed unto contempt.
Hence, of those who <hi>gave up their Names</hi>
unto the Church, and took upon them the
Profession of the Gospel, the greatest part
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57351:114"/>
were continued for a long season under their
<hi>Care and Inspection,</hi> but were not admitted
into the Society of the Church in those Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
until upon good trial they were
approved. And if any one after his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance,</hi>
was found to walk unanswerably
unto his Profession, or to fall into any <hi>known
Sin,</hi> whence Offence did ensue among the
<hi>Faithful,</hi> he was immediately dealt withal in
the Discipline of the Church; and in case
of Impenitency, separated from the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.
Nor did the <hi>Guides</hi> or <hi>Pastors</hi> of
the Churches think they had any greater
Trust committed unto them, than in this,
that they should use their utmost <hi>Care and
Diligence,</hi> that persons unmeet and unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
might not be admitted into that Church-Relation,
wherein they should have a right to
approach unto the Table of the Lord; and
to remove from thence, such as had demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
themselves unworthy of that communion.
This they looked on as belonging unto their
<hi>Ministerial Office,</hi> and as a Duty required
of them in the discharge thereof, by Jesus
Christ. And herein they had sufficient Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
both in the <hi>Rule of the Word,</hi> as also
in the <hi>Nature of the Office</hi> committed unto
them, and of the work wherewith they were
intrusted, For all Ministers are <hi>Stewards of
the Mysteries of Christ,</hi> of whom it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that they should be faithful. Now as it
belongs unto a <hi>faithful Steward</hi> to distribute
unto the Houshold of his Lord the provision
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57351:114"/>
which he hath made for them, and allows unto
them, in due season; so also to keep off those
from partaking in them, who without his
<hi>Masters</hi> Order and Warrant, would intrude
themselves into his Family, and unjustly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
themselves of the Priviledges of it. In
these things doth the Faithfulness of a
<hi>Steward</hi> consist. And the same is required
in <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel, with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Houshold of their Lord and Master,
and the Provision that he hath made for it.
These therefore being undeniably parts of
of the duty of faithful Pastors or Ministers,
it is evident how many of them we must so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
<hi>renounce</hi> a concernment in, upon a
compliance with the conformity, in matter
and manner, required of us. Neither are
these Duties such as are of light importance;
or such as may be <hi>omitted</hi> without any detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto the Souls of men. The Glory of
Christ, the Honour of the Gospel, the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church, and its Edification, are
greatly concerned in them. And they in
whose minds a neglect of these things is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
by their attendance unto some <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Forms</hi> and Appearances of Order, have
scarcely considered him aright, with whom
they have to do. Some therefore of these
Duties we shall instance in. First, It is the
Duty of all faithful Ministers of the Gospel,
to consider aright who are so <hi>admitted</hi> into
the Church, as to obtain a <hi>Right</hi> thereby
unto a Participation of all its Holy Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57351:115"/>
Take care they must, that none who
have that Right granted them by the Law of
Christ, be discouraged or excluded; nor
any <hi>altogether unworthy</hi> admitted. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
as it is generally acknowledged, a <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
Profession</hi> of Repentance, Faith and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
that is of those which are sincere
and saving, is required. To neglect an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
after these things, in those that are to
be admitted unto the <hi>Table of the Lord,</hi> is to
prostitute the Holy Ordinances of the Gospel
unto contempt and abuse; and to run cross
to the constant practice of the Church in all
<hi>Ages,</hi> even under its greatest degeneracy.
And the <hi>Right Discharge</hi> of this Duty, if
we may be allowed to be in earnest in spiritual
things; if it be believed, that it is internal
Grace and Holiness, for the sake whereof,
all outward Administrations are instituted,
and celebrated; is of great weight and
importance to the Souls of men. For on the
part of persons to be admitted, if they are
<hi>openly</hi> and <hi>visibly</hi> unworthy, what do we
thereby, but what lies in us, to destroy their
Souls? It cannot be, but that their hardning
and impenitency in sin, will be hazarded
thereby. For whereas they have granted
unto them the most <hi>Solemn Pledge</hi> of the Lord
Christ's Acceptance of them, and of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of their state towards God, that
the Church is authorized to give; what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
have they to think that their condition is
not <hi>secure,</hi> or to attend unto the Doctrine of

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ressing them to look after a
change and relinquishment of it? For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the administration of the <hi>Sealing Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi>
doth not absolutely set the Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christ unto every individual person
made partaker of them; yet it doth abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
do so to the <hi>Profession</hi> which they make.
They witness in the Name of Christ, his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation</hi>
of it, and therewithal of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
according to their real Interest in it, and
answering of it. But those who in no consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Instances do answer this Profession,
can obtain nothing unto themselves but an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of <hi>hardning,</hi> and rendring them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
in a state of Impenitency. For tell men
whilst you please of the necessity of <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to God,</hi> of Reformation and a holy Life,
yet if in the course of their <hi>Vnholiness,</hi>
you confirm unto them the <hi>Love of Christ,</hi>
and give them Pledges of their salvation by
him, they will not much regard your other
Exhortations. And thence it is come to pass
in the world, that the <hi>conformity</hi> (worth
that we contend about ten thousand times o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver)
which ought to be between the <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word,</hi> the <hi>Adninistration</hi> of the
Sacraments, and the <hi>Lives</hi> of them who are
Partakers of them, is for the most part lost.
The Word still declares, that without <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation,</hi>
without <hi>saving Faith,</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Obedience, none can enter into the
Kingdom of God. In the <hi>Adninistration</hi> of
the Other Ordinances, there is an abatement
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57351:116"/>
made of this rigorous determination, and
men have their salvation assured unto them
without a <hi>credible profession,</hi> yea, or a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of these Qualifications: And the <hi>Lives</hi>
of the most who live in the enjoyment of
these things, seem to declare, that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
believe the one, nor much regard the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Church it self, as to
its <hi>Purity,</hi> and the holiness of its commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
is dammaged by the neglect of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
inspection into this Duty: For it cannot
be, but that Ignorance, Worldliness, and
Prophaneness will spread themselves as a
<hi>Leprosie</hi> over such a Church; whence their
communion will be of very little use and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
unto Believers. And hereby do
Churches, which should be the <hi>Glory of
Christ,</hi> by their expression of the Purity,
Holiness and excellency of his Person and
Doctrine, become the principal Means and
Occasions of his <hi>Dishonour</hi> in the world;<note place="margin">Eph. 5. 25, 26, 27.</note>
and he that shall read that Christ <hi>loved his
Church, and gave himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it, that he
might sanctifie and cleanse it with the washing
of water by the Word; that he might present
it unto him self a glorious Church, not having
spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it
should be holy and without blemish;</hi> will be
much to seek after the Effects of this Design
of Christ in his Love and Death, if he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
them by what appears in <hi>Churches</hi> under
the power and influence of this neglect. Nor
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57351:116"/>
do those who plead for the continuance of
things in such a state without <hi>Reformation,</hi>
sufficiently consider the Representation that
the Lord Christ made of himself, when he
was about to deal with his Churches, some
of which were overtaken with carelesness
and negligence in this matter: And yet hath
he therein laid down a <hi>Rule,</hi> as to what kind
of proceedings <hi>Particular Churches</hi> are to
expect from him in all Generations. And it
is a matter of no small <hi>Amazement,</hi> that any
Churches dare approve and applaud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in such a state of impurity and defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as is evidently condemned by him, in
those primitive patterns. Do men think he
is <hi>changed,</hi> or that he will approve in them,
what he judged and condemned in others?
Or do they suppose he minds these things no
more; and because he is <hi>unseen,</hi> that he <hi>seeth
not;</hi> But we shall all find at length that he
is the same <hi>yesterday, to day, and for ever;</hi>
and that as the Judge of all, he stands at the
door.</p>
            <p>Now this Duty, by <hi>conformity</hi> we renounce
a concernment in, so as to attend unto it, by
virtue of <hi>Ministerial Authority;</hi> whence the
guilt of all the evil consequents thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
mentioned, must fall on us. For it is
known, that a meer shadow of the work of
this Duty, and not so much as a shadow of
<hi>Authority</hi> for it, would be left unto us: For
what is allowed in case of a sudden <hi>emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
upon an Offence taken by the <hi>whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation</hi>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:57351:117"/>
at the wickedness of any, (which
is instructed beforehand, that this ought to
be no matter of offence unto them) as it may
be it cannot be proved ever to have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in any one Instance, so the allowed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of it would yield no relief in this case.
And if any one should extend the <hi>Rule</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the interpretation that is put upon it by
the present <hi>current administration</hi> of Church-Discipline,
there is no great question to be
made what entertainment he would meet
withal for his so doing. And it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to come into the Church, as it were on
purpose to go out again. And if instead of
dealing with the Souls and Consciences of
men, in the Name and Authority of Christ,
as <hi>Stewards of his Mysteries,</hi> any can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themselves, to be <hi>Informers</hi> of Crimes
unto others, we desire their pardon, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comply with them therein. And this is the
Sum of what at present we are pleading a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.
It is the duty of <hi>Ministers</hi> of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Churches, to judge and take care con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the fitness of them, according unto the
Rules of the Gospel, and the Nature of the
Duty required of them, who are to be <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi>
into the Fellowship of the Church, and
thereby unto a participation of all the holy
Ordinances thereof. This Charge the Lord
Christ hath committed unto them, and hereof
will require an Account from them. Upon
the neglect, or right discharge of this Duty,
<hi>Consequents</hi> of great moment do depend;
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57351:117"/>
yea the due attendance unto it, hath a great
Influence into the Preservation of the <hi>Being</hi>
of the Church, and is the Hinge whereon the
well-being of it doth turn. But the power
of exercising <hi>Ministerial Authority</hi> in a just
attendance unto this Duty, we must renounce
in our conformity, if we should submit
thereunto. For we have shewed before, that
after we have <hi>conformed,</hi> we can pretend no
excuse from what is enjoyned us, or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
unto us by virtue thereof, all being found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in our own voluntary act and consent.
Hence the guilt of this <hi>Omission</hi> must wholly
fall on us, which we are not willing to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo.</p>
            <p>There are we know many <hi>Objections</hi> raised
against the committing of this Power and
Trust unto the Ministers of particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.
Great <hi>Inconveniences</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
as the consequents of it. The Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Unfitness of most Ministers for the
discharge <hi>of such a Trust,</hi> if it should be
committed unto them, the <hi>Arbitrariness</hi> and
partiality which probably others will exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
therein, the <hi>Yoke</hi> that will be brought
on the people thereby, and disorder in the
whole, are usually pleaded to this purpose,
and insisted on.</p>
            <p>But 1. This <hi>Trust</hi> is committed unto some
or other by Christ himself, and it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that so it should be. Never did he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point,
nor is it meet, nor was it ever practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Primitive Church, that <hi>every one</hi>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:57351:118"/>
should at his pleasure, on his own presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
intrude himself into a participation of
the holy things of the House of God. The
consideration of <hi>Mens Habitations,</hi> with
their Age, and the like, are of <hi>no considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
with respect unto any Rule of the Gospel.
Either therefore it must be left unto the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and will of every man, be he never so
ignorant, wicked or profligate, to impose
himself on the <hi>communion of any Church</hi> of
Christ, or there must be a Judgment in the
Church, concerning them who are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto their communion.</p>
            <p>2. From the first planting of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
those who <hi>preached the Gospel</hi> unto
the conversion of the Souls of men; were
principally intrusted with this Power, and it
was their duty to <hi>gather</hi> them who were so
converted, into that Church-Order and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
wherein they might partake of the
Sacred Mysteries, or solemn Ordinances of
the Christian Worship. And this course of
proceeding continued uninterrupted, with
some little variation in the manner of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of this Power and Duty, until <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
had spread it self over the face of the
whole professing Church in the world: But
still a shadow and resemblance of it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and in the <hi>Papal Church</hi> it self to
this day, particular <hi>Confessors</hi> are esteemed
competent Judges of the meetness of their
<hi>Penitents</hi> for an admission unto the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their Church. And who shall now
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:57351:118"/>
be esteemed more meet for the discharge of
this duty, than those who succeed in the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and Work of <hi>Preaching the Word,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
men are prepared for Church-Society?
And as it is a thing utterly unheard of in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
that those who <hi>dispensed the Word</hi>
unto the Illumination and Conversion of men,
should not have the power of their disposal
as to their being <hi>added to the Church,</hi> or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
for a time, as there was occasion; so
it is as uncouth, that those who now sustain
the same Place and Office unto the several
Congregations attending on their Ministry,
should be deprived of it.</p>
            <p>3. If there be that <hi>Ignorance</hi> and Disabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in Ministers, as is pretended, the blame of
it reflects on them by whom they are made.
And we are not obliged to accommodate any
of the Wayes or Truths of Christ unto the
<hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> of men. And if they
are insufficient for this work, how come they
to be so sufficient for that which is greater,
namely to <hi>divide the Word aright</hi> unto all their
Hearers? But we speak of such Ministers as
are <hi>competently qualified</hi> according to the Rule
of the Gospel, for the discharge of their
Office; and no other ought there to be.
And such there are, blessed be God, through
the watchful care of our Lord Jesus Christ
over his Church, and his Supplies of the Gifts
of his Spirit unto them. And such as these
know it is their <hi>Duty</hi> to study, meditate,
pray, <hi>ask Counsel</hi> and advice of others, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:57351:119"/>
of more Wisdom and Experience than
themselves, that they may know how in all
things to <hi>behave themselves in the House of God.</hi>
Nor will God be wanting unto them who in
sincerity seek direction from him, for the
discharge of any Duty which he calls them
unto. Other security of regular, orderly,
and useful proceedings in this matter, Christ
hath not given us; nor do we need: For
the due Observance of <hi>his</hi> Appointments, will
not fail the attaining of <hi>his</hi> Ends; which
ought to be ours also.</p>
            <p>4. The Judgment and acting of the Church-Officers
in the <hi>Admission</hi> of persons into the
compleat Society of the Faithful, is not <hi>arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi>
as is pretended. They have the <hi>Rule</hi>
of the Scripture, which they are diligently to
attend unto. This is the entire Rule which
the Lord Christ hath left unto his Church,
both for their Doctrine and Discipline: What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is beyond this, or beside it, is not his,
nor owned by him. What is not done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this Rule, is of no force in the
<hi>Consciences of men,</hi> though it may stand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
lawfully recalled, for the preservation of
outward Order. And whatever <hi>Arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
may be supposed, in making a judgment
upon the Rule of the Word, or in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of its rule unto the present Case, it
must abide in some or other. And who shall
be thought more meet, or able to make a right
determination thereon, than those whose
<hi>Duty</hi> it is, and who have the advantage to
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:57351:119"/>
be acquainted with all Circumstances belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Case proposed. Besides, there is
the Judgment of the <hi>Church,</hi> or the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>
it self, which is greatly to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Even in the <hi>Church of England</hi> a sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension
of any from the Lords Supper, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
unto the <hi>Curate,</hi> upon the Offence of
the <hi>Congregation;</hi> which is a sufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that a Judgment in this Case is own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be their due: For none can take <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi>
but upon a Judgment of the Matter
at which he is offended; nor in this case, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a right to determine that <hi>some Offences</hi>
ought to debar Persons from a participation
of the holy Ordinances; as also what those
Offences are. This therefore is to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as an Aid and Assistance unto <hi>Ministers</hi>
in the discharge of their Duty. It is the
Church into whose communion persons are
to be admitted. And although it be no way
necessary, that determinations in this Case
should be always made by <hi>Suffrage,</hi> or a <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
of Votes</hi> in the Body of the Church;
yet if the Sense or Mind of the <hi>Congregation</hi>
may be known, or is so, (upon the Enquiry
that ought to be made unto that purpose)
that any persons are unmeet for their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
it is not convenient they should be
received; nor will their <hi>Admission</hi> in this
case be of any advantage to themselves or the
Church. The Light of Reason, and the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
constitutive Principles of all <hi>Free
Societies,</hi> such as the Church is, ascribe this
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:57351:120"/>
Liberty unto it;<note place="margin">Acts 9. 26, 27, 28.</note> and the Primitive Church
practised accordingly: So also is the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Desire of the <hi>Congregation</hi> to be
considered in the admission of any,<note place="margin">Ro. 14. 1.</note> if they
are made known to the Guides of it. For
it is expected from them, they should <hi>confirm
their Love</hi> unto them without dissimulation,
as Members of the same Body; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in their approbation of what is done,
their Rulers have Light and Encouragement
in their own Duty. Besides, there is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
and ought to be preserved a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
among Churches themselves:</hi> By vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
hereof, they are not only to make use of
<hi>mutual Aid,</hi> Advice and Counsel, antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
unto a actings of Importance; but each
<hi>particular</hi> Church is upon just demand to give
an account unto other Churches of what they
do in the Administration of the Ordinances
of the Gospel among them; and if in any
thing it hath mistaken or miscarried, to <hi>recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie</hi>
them upon their Advice and Judgment.
And it were easie to manifest how through
these Means and Advantages, the <hi>Edification</hi>
of the Church, and the <hi>Liberty</hi> of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
is sufficiently secured, in that <hi>discharge
of Duty</hi> which is required in the Pastors of
the Churches, about the <hi>Admission</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
unto a Participation of holy ordinances
in them.</p>
            <p>5. This Duty therefore, must either be
<hi>wholly neglected,</hi> which will unavoidably tend
to the corrupting and debauching of all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:57351:120"/>
and in the end unto their Ruine; or it
must be attended unto by each <hi>particular
Church</hi> under the conduct of their Guides
and Rulers; or some others must take it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
themselves. What hath been the issue of
a Supposal, that it may be discharged in the
<hi>latter way,</hi> is too well known, to be insisted
on: For whilst those who undertake the
<hi>Exercise</hi> of Church-Power, are such as do
not dispense <hi>the Word,</hi> or preach it unto
them, towards whom it is to be exercised, but
are strangers unto their spiritual state, and
all the Circumstances of it; whilst they have
no way to <hi>act</hi> or <hi>exercise</hi> their presumed Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
but by <hi>Citations, Processes, Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi>
and <hi>Penalties,</hi> according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Secular Courts of Judicature in Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Civil and Criminal; and whilst the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of it is committed unto men, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unacquainted with, and inconcerned in the
<hi>Discipline</hi> of the Gospel, or the preservation
of the Church of Christ in Purity and Order;
and whilst herein, many, the most, or all of
them who are so employed, have thereby out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Emoluments</hi> and Advantages, which
they do principally regard; the due and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
care of the right Order of the Churches,
unto the Glory of Christ, and their own
Edification, is utterly omitted and
lost. It is true, many think this the only
<hi>decent, useful</hi> and expedient <hi>way</hi> for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church, and think it won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
unreasonable that others will not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:57351:121"/>
thereunto, and acquiesce therein. But
what would they have us do? or what is it
that they would perswade us unto? Is it that
this <hi>kind of Rule</hi> in and over the Church, hath
Institution given it in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
from <hi>Apostolieal</hi> Practice? Both
they and we know, that no pretence of any
such Plea can be made: Is it, that the first
Churches after the Apostles, or the Primitive
Church, did find such a <hi>kind of Rule</hi> to be
necessary, and therefore erected it among
themselves? There is nothing more remote
from Truth. Would they perswade us, that
as <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Gospel, and such as have,
or may have the care of particular Churches
committed unto us, that we have no such
concernment in these things, but what we
may solemnly renounce, and leave them
wholly to the mannagement of others? We
are not able to believe them. The Charge
that is given unto us, the Account that will
be required of us, the nature of the Office we
are called unto, continually <hi>testifie</hi> other
things unto us. Wherefore we dare not <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily</hi>
engage into the neglect or omission
of this Duty, which Christ requireth at our
hands, and of whose neglect we see so many
sad Consequents and Effects. The Lord
Christ, we know hath the same <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and
makes the same Judgment of his Churches, as
he did of old, when he made a solemn <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
and Declaration of them: And then
we find that he charged the <hi>Failings,</hi> Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:57351:121"/>
and Miscarriages of the Churches prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
upon the <hi>Angels</hi> or Ministers of them.
And we would not willingly by our neglect,
render our selves obnoxious unto his Displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
nor betray the Churches whereunto we
do relate, unto his just indignation, for
their declension from the Purity of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,
and the vigour of that Faith
and Love, which they had professed.
We should moreover by the <hi>Conformity</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of us, and according to the Terms on which
it is proposed, engage our selves against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of our <hi>Ministerial Office</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> with
respect unto them who are already Members
of Particular Churches. For this we carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with us, that by <hi>Conforming</hi> we volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
consent unto the whole <hi>state of Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and unto all that we are to do, or not to do,
by the Law thereof. Now it is not to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
that all who are duly <hi>initiated</hi> or joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto any Church, shall always walk blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
according unto the <hi>Evangelical Rule</hi> of
obedience, without giving offence unto others.
The state of the Church, is not like to be so
<hi>blessed</hi> in this World, that all who belong unto
it should be constantly and perpetually inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.
This indeed is the <hi>Duty</hi> of all, but it will
fall out otherwise. It did so amongst the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Churches</hi> of old, and is not therefore
otherwise to be expected amongst us, on
whom the ends of the world are come, and
who are even pressed with the Decayes and
Ruines of it. Many <hi>Hypocrites</hi> may obtain an
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:57351:122"/>
               <hi>admission</hi> into Church Societies, by the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Rules that any can proceed upon therein:
And these after they have <hi>known</hi> and professed
the wayes of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> may, and often do
turn <hi>aside from the holy Commandment delivered
unto them,</hi> and fall again into the Polutions of
the world. Many <hi>good men,</hi> and really sincere
Believers, may through the power of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
be surprized into <hi>faults</hi> and sins, scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to the Gospel, and offensive to the whole
Congregation, whereof they are Members.
Hath the Lord Christ appointed no <hi>Relief</hi> in
and for his Churches in such Cases;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 1, 6, 7.</note> no <hi>way</hi>
whereby they may <hi>clear</hi> themselves from a
participation in such impieties,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 6.</note> or deliver
themselves from being looked on as those who
give countenance unto them,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 11.</note> as they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in this Communion may and ought to
be;<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note> no <hi>Power</hi> whereby they may put forth
from among them, the <hi>old Leaven</hi> which
would otherwise infect the whole;<note place="margin">Mat. 18. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, Rev. 2 2.</note> no way
to discharge themselves and their <hi>Societies</hi> of
such Persons as are impenitent in their Sins?
No <hi>Means</hi> for the awakening, conviction,
Humiliation, and Recovery of them that have
offended; no <hi>way</hi> to declare his Mind and
Judgment in such Cases, with the Sentence
that he denounceth in Heaven against them
that are impenitent? If he hath done none
of these things, it is evident, that no <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
in this world can possibly be preserved
from disorder and Confusion. Nor can they
by Love and the Fruits of an holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niou,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:57351:122"/>
be kept in such a condition, as wherein
he can be pleased with them, or continue to
<hi>walk amongst them:</hi> For let men please them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
whilst they will, with the <hi>Name of the
Church,</hi> it is no otherwise with them, where
Persons <hi>Obstinately and impenitently wicked,</hi>
and whose Lives are wholly discrepant from
the Rule of the Gospel, are suffered to abide
without controll. But if he hath made the
Provision enquired after in this Case, as it is
evident that he hath; both the <hi>Authority</hi> he
hath granted unto his Church for these Ends,
his Commands to exercise it with Care and
Watchfulness, with the Rules given them to
proceed by, with the known End of all Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
Churches for the Promotion of Holiness,
being all open and plain in the Scripture; it
must then be enquired, unto whom this Trust
is <hi>firstly committed,</hi> and of whom these Duties
are principally required.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Private Members</hi> of the Church, what
is their Duty, and the way how they may
regularly attend unto the Discharge of it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Mind of Christ, in case of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
Sins and Offences among them, they
are so plainly and particularly laid down and
directed, as that setting aside the Difficulties
that are cast on the Rule herein, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<hi>forced</hi> and <hi>unproveable exceptions</hi> of
some interested Persons; that none can be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of what is required of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.
<hi>v.</hi> 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. And a Liberty
to discharge their <hi>Duty</hi> herein, they are bound
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:57351:123"/>
by the Law of Christ in due Order to provide
for. If they are abridged hereof, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
thereby of so great a Means of their
<hi>own Edification,</hi> as also of the usefulness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in them towards the <hi>Church,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
they are Members, it is a spiritual Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
that they suffer under. And where
it is voluntarily neglected by them,<note place="margin">Lev. 19. 17.</note> not only
the Guilt of their own, but of <hi>other Mens sins</hi>
also lies upon them.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2. 9, 10. &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 15.</note> Neither is their own
Guilt small herein; For <hi>suffering sin to abide
on a Brother</hi> without reproof, is a fruit of <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi>
in the Interpretation of the <hi>Law;</hi> and
this hatred is a sin of an heynous Nature, in
the sense of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> The Duty also of
the <hi>whole Church</hi> in such Cases is no less evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
declared. For from such Persons as
walk disorderly, and refuse to reform, on
due Admonition, they are to <hi>withdraw,</hi> and
to <hi>put from amongst them</hi> such obstinate Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
as also previously thereunto, to <hi>watch</hi>
diligently least any root of <hi>bitterness spring up
among</hi> them, whereby they might be defiled.
And hereunto also are subservient all the
Commands that are given them to <hi>exhort</hi> and
<hi>admonish</hi> one another, that the whole Church
may be preserved in Purity, Order, Holiness
and Faithfulness. But the chief enquiry is,
with whom rests the <hi>Principal Care</hi> and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
according to the Mind of Christ, to see the
<hi>Discipline</hi> of the Church in Particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations
exercised, and to exercise it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.
If this should be found to be in the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:57351:123"/>
               <hi>Ministers,</hi> and through their neglect in the
Administration of it, Offenders be left in their
sins and Impenitency, without a due Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the means for their <hi>Healing</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery;
if the Church its self come to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
thereby, and to fall under the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
of Jesus Christ;</hi> as these things, in one
Degree or other, more or less will ensue on
that neglect, it will not turn unto their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Account</hi> at the great Day. That this
is their Duty, that this <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
is committed unto them, the Reasons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
insisted on, in the Case of <hi>Admission,</hi> do
undeniably evince. And if those Ministers
who do <hi>Conscientiously</hi> attend unto the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of their Ministerial Office towards
particular Flocks, would but examine their
<hi>own hearts</hi> by the Light of open and plain
Scripture Testimonies, with the Nature of
their <hi>Office,</hi> and of the work they are ingaged
in, there would need little arguing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
them, of what Trust is committed unto
them, or what is required from them. If the
Consciences of others are not concerned in
these things, if they have no Light into the
Duty which seems to be incumbent on them,
their Principles and Practices, or as we think
mistakes and neglects, can be no Rule unto
us. What we may be <hi>forbidden,</hi> what we may
be hindred in, is of another Consideration.
But for us <hi>voluntarily</hi> to ingage unto the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of that Duty, which we cannot but
believe that it will be required of us, is an
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:57351:124"/>
Evil which we are every way obliged to
avoid.</p>
            <p>There are also sundry <hi>Particular Duties,</hi>
relating unto these that are more general,
which in like manner, on the Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
proposed unto us, must be foregone
and omitted. And where by these means or
neglects some of the Principal ways of Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
<hi>Church Communion</hi> are cast out of the
Church, some of the means of the Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of its Members are wholly lost, and sundry
Duties incumbent on them are virtually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
unto them, untill they are utterly
grown into disuse, it is no wonder if in such
Churches where these Evils are inveterate and
Remediless, <hi>Particular Persons</hi> do peaceably
provide for their own Edification by joyning
themselves unto such Societies as wherein the
Rule of the Gospel is more practically atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unto. It is taken for granted that the
Church is not corrupted by the <hi>wicked
Persons</hi> that are of its Communion; nor its
Administrations defiled by their Presence and
Communication in them; nor the Edification
of others prejudiced thereby, because it hath
been so said by some of the <hi>Ancients;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 6, 9, 10.</note> though
whether suitably unto the Doctrine of the
<hi>Apostles</hi> or no,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 6.</note> is very questionable. But
suppose this should be so; yet where <hi>wicked
Persons</hi> are admitted, without Distinction or
Discrimination, unto the Communion of the
Church where they are <hi>tollerated</hi> therein,
without any procedure with them, or against
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:57351:124"/>
them, contrary to express Rules of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
given to that purpose; so that those
who are really <hi>Pious</hi> among them can by no
means prevail for the Reformation of the
whole, they may, not only without breach
of Charity, impairing of Faith or Love, or
without the least suspition of the Guilt of
<hi>Schism,</hi> forsake the Communion of such a
Congregation, to joyn unto another, where
there is more Care of Piety, Purity, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
but if they have <hi>any Care</hi> of their own
Edification, and a <hi>due Care</hi> of their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they will understand it to be their Duty
so to do.</p>
            <p>And we may a little touch hereon once for
all. The General End of the Institution of
Churches, as such, is the visible mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Enmity</hi> on the part of the <hi>seed of
the Woman,</hi> Christ the Head, and the Members
of his Body mystical, against the <hi>Serpent</hi> and
his Seed. In the pursuit of this End, God ever
had a Church in the world, <hi>separate</hi> from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
openly profane, doing the work of the
Devil their Father. And there is nothing in
any Church Constitution, which tends unto,
or is compliant with, the <hi>mixing</hi> and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling
these distinct seeds, whilst they are such,
and visibly appear so to be. And therefore
as the <hi>Types, Prophecies</hi> and Promises of the
Old Testament, did declare that when all
things were actually <hi>brought unto an Head</hi> in
Christ Jesus, the Churches and all things that
belong unto it should be <hi>Holy;</hi> that is, visibly
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:57351:125"/>
so;<note place="margin">Isa. 26. 2.</note> so the Description generally, and unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
given us of the Churches of the <hi>New
Testament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 43. 12.</note> when actually called and erected,
is,<note place="margin">Chap. 44. 9.</note> that they consisted of Persons <hi>called, sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
justified, ingrafted into Christ;</hi> or Saints,
Believers,<note place="margin">Levit. 11. 44.</note> faithful ones, purified and separate
unto God. Such they professed themselves to
be,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 6.</note> such they were judged to be by them that
were concerned in their Communion;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 1, 2.</note> and as
such they ingage themselves to walk in their
Conversation.<note place="margin">Chap. 12. 13.</note> By what Authority so great a
<hi>Change</hi> should be now wrought in the Nature
and Constitution of Churches,<note place="margin">Phil 1. 4</note> that it should
be altogether indifferent of what sort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
they do consist,<note place="margin">Col. 2. 11.</note> we know not. Yea, to
speak plainly, we greatly fear that both the
Worship and Worshipers are defiled,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 22.</note> where
open impenitent sinners are freely admitted
unto all sacred Administrations, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul.
And we are sure, that as God complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that his <hi>Sanctuary is polluted,</hi> when there
are brought into it,<note place="margin">Ezek 44. 1.</note> 
               <hi>strangers uncircumcised in
heart, and uncircumcised in flesh;</hi> so the true
Members of the Church are warned of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and dangers of such defiling mixtures,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 6.</note> and
charged to watch against them.</p>
            <p>We might yet further insist on the great
evil it would be in us,<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 15, 16.</note> if we should give a <hi>seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
outward Approbation</hi> unto those things,
and their use, which we cannot but condemn,
and desire to have removed out of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God. And moreover, there is, as we
believe, an Obligation upon us, to give a
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:57351:125"/>
               <hi>Testimony</hi> unto the Truth about the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, in his Church, and not absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to hide the Light we have received therein
<hi>under a Bushel.</hi> Nor would we render the
Reformation of the Church absolutely hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
by our professed compliance with the
Things that ought to be reform'd. But what
hath been pleaded already is sufficient to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
that there neither is, nor can be a <hi>Guilt
of Schism</hi> charged either on Ministers or People
who with-hold themselves from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of that Church, or those Churches,
whereof the things mentioned are made <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi>
necessary and indispensible; and
wherein they must be denyed the Liberty of
performing many Duties made necessary unto
them by the Command of Jesus Christ. And
as the rigid Imposition of <hi>unscriptural Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
of Communion, is the principal Cause of
all the <hi>Schisms</hi> and Divisions that are among
us; so let them be removed and taken out of
the way, and we doubt not, but that among
all that sincerely profess the Gospel, there may
be that peace, and such an Agreement ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
as in observance whereof, they may all
exercise those Duties of <hi>Love,</hi> which the strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Union doth require. These we profess our
selves <hi>ready for,</hi> so far as God shall be pleased
to help us in the Discharge of our Duty; as
also to renounce every Principle or Opinion
whereof we may be convinced that they are
in the least opposite unto, or inconsistent with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
the <hi>Royal Law of Love,</hi> and the due exercise
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:57351:126"/>
thereof. If men will continue to charge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
or revile us, either out of a causeless dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tast
against our persons, or <hi>Misunderstanding
of our Principles</hi> and wayes, or upon uncertain
<hi>Reports,</hi> or meerly prompted thereunto,
through a vain elation of mind arising from
the Distance wherein, through their Secular
Advantages, they look upon us to stand from
them; as we cannot help it, so we shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
not to be greatly moved at it: For it
is known, that this hath been the Lot and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those who have gone before us, in the
Profession of the Gospel, and <hi>sincere endeavors</hi>
to vindicate the Worship of God from the
Disorders and Abuses that have been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
into it; and probably will be theirs
who shall come after us. But the whole of our
care is, that <hi>in godly simplicity and sincerity we
may have our conversation in the World,</hi> not
<hi>corrupting the Word of God,</hi> nor <hi>using our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
as a cloak of maliciousness, but as becomes
the Servants of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps it will yet be pleaded, that this
is not the whole which we are charged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
For it is said that we do not <hi>only withdraw
our selves from the communion of the Church of
of</hi> England, <hi>but also that we assemble in separate
Congregations for the Celebration of the whole
Worship of God;</hi> whereby we evidently make
a Division in the Church, and contract unto
our selves the guilt of Schism; For what can
there be more required thereunto. But what
would those who make use of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this Objection
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:57351:126"/>
have us to do? would they have us <hi>starve</hi> our
souls, by a wilful neglect of the means appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for their nourishment? Or would they
have us live in a constant omission of all the
Commands of Christ? By them, or those
whose Cause they plead, we are <hi>cast out</hi> and
excluded from Church Communion with
them, by the <hi>unscriptural Conditions</hi> of it
which they would force upon us. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
between us that ensues hereon, they are
the <hi>Causes</hi> of, not we; for we are ready to
joyn with them, or any others, upon the
Terms of Christ and the Gospel. And do they
think it meet that we should revenge <hi>their
fault</hi> upon our selves, by a voluntary absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from all the wayes and means of our
edification? Doth any man think that Jesus
Christ leaves any of his Disciples unto such a
condition, as wherein it is impossible they
should <hi>observe his Commands</hi> and Institutions
without sin? That we should joyn in some
Societies, that in them we should assemble
together for the worship of God in him, and
that we should in them <hi>do and observe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he hath appointed,</hi> we look upon as our
indispensible Duty, made so unto us by his
Commands. These things, say some, you
shall not do with us, if you will do no more;
and if you do them among your selves, you
are <hi>Schismaticks.</hi> But this is a severity, which
we know we shall not meet with at the last
Day. <hi>We stand at the Judgment Seat of Jesus
Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:57351:127"/>
It will, it may be, be demanded, by what
<hi>Warrant or Authority</hi> we do assemble our
selves in Church Societies for the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gospel Ordinances; and who gave us
this Authority? VVe answer, That it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
there is a <hi>Difference</hi> between them
and us, so that with them we cannot enjoy the
VVorship of God. But of this Difference we
are not the <hi>Cause,</hi> nor do give occasion to any
blameable Divisions, by our Principles or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises.
VVhere the Cause is found, there the
guilt remains. This being the state of things
with us, it is fond to imagine that any Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of the Gospel do absolutely want a <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty
or Authority</hi> to obey Jesus Christ, to
observe his Commands, and to serve him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his revealed VVill. His <hi>Command
in his Word,</hi> his Promise of the acceptance of
them, and of his presence among them, in all
the Acts of their holy obedience; the assistance
and guidance of his holy Spirit, which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
graciously unto them; are a sufficient
<hi>Warranty and Authority</hi> for what they do in
express complyance with his Commands, and
more they will not plead a power for. VVhere
the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of Christ are, there is his
Authority. And this is no otherwise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto men, but to enable them to act
<hi>obedientially</hi> towards him, and <hi>Ministerially</hi>
towards others. And were Church Actings
considered more with respect unto the <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi>
that in them is performed unto Christ,
which is their first and principal Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:57351:127"/>
it would quickly be evident whence men
might have <hi>Authority</hi> for their performance.
And by the same means are we directed in
their Order and Manner. Besides the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
who go before the people in their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
are all of them (so far as we know) so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
set apart unto their Office and VVork,
according unto what Christ hath appointed;
and their Duty it is, to teach unto all men the
good wayes of Christ, and to go before them
who are convinced and perswaded by them,
in their practise. These things hath their
<hi>Lord and Master</hi> required of them, and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
concerning them will he call them unto
at the last Day. <hi>A Dispensation is committed
unto them,</hi> and a necessity is thence incumbent
on them to preach the Gospel; and who shall
excuse them if they neglect so to do? For
that all those who are Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
are called to preach the Gospel, and that
diligently; every one, according as he hath
received the <hi>Gift of the Grace of God;</hi> is out
of question with them that do believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel:
And of the <hi>Stewardship</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
unto them herein, are they to give an
<hi>Account.</hi> And we do know that it is a <hi>fearful
thing</hi> for sinners, that is, wilful neglecters of
his Commands, to <hi>fall into the hands of the
living God.</hi> Our Lord Jesus Christ also hath
testified beforehand, that he who <hi>setteth his
hand to this Plough, and looks back again,</hi> is not
fit for the Kingdome of God. He alone who
calls them to this work, can discharge them of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:57351:128"/>
it; and that either by the Rule of his Word,
or his Providence. And when men are invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly
hindred, as many are at this day, it is
their suffering, but not their sin. Otherwise
none can <hi>absolve them</hi> from the Duty they owe
to Jesus Christ in this matter; and that <hi>Debt</hi>
which they owe to the Souls of men, in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
the work of the Ministry. Some indeed
suppose, or pretend to suppose, that a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
given them by <hi>Superiors,</hi> forbidding
them to preach, though not by, nor according
unto any Rule of the Gospel, doth discharge
them from any Obligation so to do, that it
shall be no more their Duty. It would do so
no doubt, had they received no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to preach the Gospel, nor from any
other Authority, than that of and from those
<hi>Superiors</hi> by whom they are forbidden.
But being perswaded that they have so from
him who is <hi>higher than the highest,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
acquiesce in this Discharge, nor being
<hi>bought with a price,</hi> can they now <hi>be Servants
of men.</hi> But by whom are they thus forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to preach? It will be supposed, that
the Church which differs from them, and
which originally makes it self a <hi>part</hi> in these
Differences, by the conditions of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which it would impose upon them, is no
competent Judge in this case: Nor will their
Prohibitions, who apparently thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
their own Quarrel, influence the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of them that dissent from them.
For we speak not of what <hi>will</hi> or may take
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:57351:128"/>
place; but what the <hi>Consciences of men</hi> will
or may be concerned in. By the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
they are not forbidden to preach, that
we know of: It is true, they are prohibited
to preach in the <hi>Legal Publick Meeting Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
or Churches; and these places being in
the power and care of the Magistrate, it is
meet his <hi>Terms and conditions</hi> of their use
should be accepted of, or his Prohibition
observed, or his Penalty quietly undergone,
where a peaceable occasion is made use of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
unto it. As to other places, Ministers
are not <hi>absolutely forbid to preach</hi> in them; no
such power is as yet assumed or exercised:
Only the <hi>Manner of Assemblies</hi> for Sacred
Worship, and the <hi>Number</hi> of them that may
assemble, are regulated by Laws for Secular
Ends, or Civil Security; and that under ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Penalties incurred on a contrary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
But the Consciences of <hi>Ministers</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be concerned in such Laws, so far as to
be exempted by them from the Obligation
that lies upon them from the <hi>command of
Christ</hi> to preach the Gospel. This they are
commanded by him to do, and others know
the <hi>penalties</hi> from men, under the danger
whereof they must attend unto them. Besides
the reason of these <hi>Legal Prohibitions,</hi> so far
as they do extend, are taken, from Civil
considerations alone; namely, of the Peace
and quiet of the Nation; and not from any
Scripture or Religious Rules. And were these
Prohibitions only <hi>temporary,</hi> or occasional,
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:57351:129"/>
suited unto such Emergencies as may give
countenance unto their necessity, there might
be a proportionable compliance with them.
But whereas they respect <hi>all times alike,</hi> it is no
doubt incumbent on them, who act any thing
contrary unto such <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> to secure
their own Consciences, that they no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere
with the Intention and End of the
Law, by giving the least countenance or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
unto <hi>civil disturbances;</hi> and others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
by their peaceable deportment in all they
do. But whereas they have received a <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi>
from the Lord Christ to <hi>trade</hi> withal, have
accepted of his Terms, and engaged into his
Service, without any condition of exception
in case of such Prohibitions, it is not possible
they should satisfie their Consciences in desist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from their work on such Occurrences,
any farther than in what they must yield unto
outward force and necessity. It is pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by some, that if such a <hi>Legal Prohibition</hi>
were given unto all the Ministers of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
it would not be obligatory unto them:
For if it should be so esteemed, it were in the
power of any <hi>Supream Magistrate lawfully</hi>
to forbid the whole work of Preaching the
Gospel unto his Subjects; which is contrary
to the Grant made by God the Father, unto
Jesus Christ, that <hi>all Nations should be his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance;</hi>
and the Commission he gave thereon
unto his Apostles to <hi>teach all Nations,</hi> and to
<hi>preach the Gospel to every creature</hi> under heaven.
But it being <hi>some</hi> only that are concerned in
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:57351:129"/>
this Prohibition, it is their duty for Peace
sake, to acquiesce in the will of their <hi>Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi>
therein, whilst there are others sufficient
to carry on the same work. That Peace is or
may be secur'd on other Terms, hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
declared: But that <hi>one mans Liberty</hi>
to attend unto his Duty, and his doing it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
should excuse another from that
which is <hi>personally</hi> incumbent on himself, is a
matter not easily apprehended, nor can be
readily digested. Besides, what is pretended
of the <hi>sufficient number of Preachers</hi> without
any contribution of aid from the <hi>Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,</hi>
is indeed but pretended: For if all
that are found in the Faith, gifted, and called
to the work of the <hi>Ministry</hi> in these Nations,
were equally encouraged unto, and in their
work, yet would they not be able to answer
the necessities of the Souls of men, requiring
an attendance unto it, in a due measure and
manner; And those who have exercised
themselves unto <hi>compassionate thoughts</hi> towards
the multitudes of poor Sinners in these Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
will not be otherwise minded. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
these things being premised, we shall shut
up these Discourses, with a brief Answer unto
the foregoing Objection which was the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of them. And we say;</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Schism</hi> being the Name of a Sin,
or somewhat that is evil; it can in no Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
be any maes Duty, But we have
manifested, as satisfactorily unto our own
Consciences, so we hope unto the minds of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:57351:130"/>
persons, that in our <hi>present condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
our Assemblies for the Worship of God,
are our express Duty, and so can have no
Affinity with any sin or evil. And those
who intend to charge us with <hi>Schisme,</hi> in or
for our Assemblies, must first prove them not
to be our Duty.</p>
            <p>2. Notwithstanding them, or any thing by
us performed in them, we do preserve our
communion entire with the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
(that is, all the visible Professors of the
Gospel in this Nation) as it is a part of the
<hi>Catholick Church,</hi> in the Unity of the Faith
owned therein, provided it be not measured
by the present<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Opinions of some, who have
evidently departed from it. Our <hi>Non-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance</hi>
of the present Government and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
of the Church, as apprehended Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal,
and as it is in the hands of meerly <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
persons,</hi> or such as are pretended
so to be, we have accounted for before. But
we are <hi>One</hi> with the whole Body of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of the Protestant Religion, in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
avowment of the same Faith.</p>
            <p>3. Into <hi>Particular Churches</hi> we neither
are, nor can be admitted, but on those terms
and conditions, which not only we may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but which we are bound in a way of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to refuse. And this also hath been plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before. Besides, no man is so obliged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
communion with any <hi>Particular or Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
Church</hi> in this Nation, but that it is in
his own power at any time to relinquish it,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:57351:130"/>
and to secure himself also from all Laws which
may respect that communion, by the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of his Habitation. It is therefore evident
that we never had any relation unto any <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial
Church,</hi> but what is Civil and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
a relinquishment whereof is practised
at pleasure every day, by all sorts of men.
Continuing therefore in the constant Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the same Faith, with all other <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
in the Nation,</hi> and the whole Body
thereof, as united in the Profession of it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one Civil or Political Head; and having
antecedently no <hi>Evangelical Obligation</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us unto Local communion in the same Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of Worship <hi>numerically</hi> with any
particular or <hi>Parochial Church;</hi> and being
prohibited from any such communion by the
Terms, Conditions and Customes indispensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
annexed unto it, by the Laws of the Land,
and the Church, which are not lawful <hi>for us
to observe,</hi> being Christs Freemen: It being
moreover our duty to assemble our selves in
Societies for the Celebration of the Worship
of God in Christ, as that which is expresly
commanded; we are abundantly satisfied,
that however we may be <hi>censured,</hi> judged, or
condemned by men, in and for what we do;
yet that he doth both <hi>accept</hi> us here, and
will acquit us hereafter, whom we serve and
seek in all things to obey. Wherefore we
are not convinced that any <hi>Principle</hi> or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
which we own or allow, is in any thing
contrary to that <hi>Love,</hi> Peace, and Unity,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:57351:131"/>
which the Lord Christ requireth to be kept
and preserved among his Disciples, or those
that profess Faith in him, and Obedience
unto him according to the Gospel.
We know not any thing in them but what is
consistent and compliant with that <hi>Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Vnion,</hi> which ought to be in, and among
the Churches of Christ, the terms whereof we
are ready to hold and observe, even with them
that in sundry things differ from us; as we
shall endeavour also to exercise all Duties of
the same Love, Peaceableness, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
towards them by whom we are hated
and reviled.</p>
