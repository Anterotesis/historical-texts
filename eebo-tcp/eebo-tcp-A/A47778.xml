         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of <hi>Aberdene,</hi> and the People called
<hi>Quakers,</hi> as a fulfilling of any Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge

with particular condition of
having the Publick places to dispute
in, before the Auditories, before whom
they conceive they have been misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented.</p>
                  <p>2. It is provided that when any of
either Party is speaking, if any of their
company offer to speak, he that is
speaking is to be silent; but if two of a
Party speak at once, he that is seen to
obtrude himself, shall be judged im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,



<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46415:4"/>
and excluded thereby from
farther access.</p>
                  <p>3. That each speaker on any of the
sides have full liberty, and time to
speak, without interruption of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Party; and that he that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts
shall be debarred from farther

School-terms and distinctions (as

that they may be opened to the People

into the Respondent.</p>

of Divinity came to us; and signified
that they looked upon themselves as
concerned; because mention is made
of such in the beginning of that Paper.
To whom we answered, that they
were not the Persons challenged by Us;
as not being the Publick Preachers that
had misrepresented Us: But seeing
they were desirous to debate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we were not unwilling to render
to any, a reason of the hope that is in
us; and therefore should not decline
it. And forasmuch as some did object,
that we were at a loss, as engaging
with them; because there would be
little advantage in case we had any
victory and a greater reflection, should
we appear to be at any loss. To such
we had, and have this to say; that as
we are not afraid to meet with the
greatest and ablest of the Preachers
themselves: so the Truth leads us not
to despise any. As <hi>R. B.</hi> was going
on, he was interrupted.</p>

though <hi>R. B.</hi> pretends in his Preface
to be against School Divinity; yet his
Theses are full of it: and there are
many other contradictions, which I
will not now take notice of, The
Preachers and Ministers of the Word,
not finding themselves concerned; we
Young-men, and but Students, have
offered to dispute: in the Articles the
<hi>Quakers</hi> have been very unreasonable;
and particularly, <hi>G. K.</hi> did refuse any
Article should be put in, against railing;
because he said, that might be railing
in me, which was not in him; because
he (to wit, <hi>G. K.</hi> was immediately
led by the Spirit. We have concluded,
that being Young men, in case the
<hi>Quakers</hi> should have any advantage,
it will not be of great consequence,
and if we have advantage, we hope it
may be useful; because these are the
great Prophets and Preachers, of the
<hi>Quakers.</hi>

I never said any such thing as is by that

the revelation of the Son is in, and by
the Spirit; therefore the Testimony of the
Spirit, is that alone by which the true
knowledge of God hath been, is and can
be only revealed; who as by the moving
of his own Spirit converted the Chaos of
this World, into that wonderful order,
wherein it was in the beginning; and
Created Man a living Soul to rule and
govern it: so by the revelation of the same
spirit, he hath made manifest himself all
along unto the Sons of Men, both Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs,
Prophets, and Apostles; which
Revelations of God, by the spirit, whether
by outward voices, and appearances,
Dreams, or inward objective manifestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Object of their Faith, and remaineth yet
so to be, since the Object of the Saints
Faith is the same in all Ages, though set

moreover these Divine inward Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

urged, that Hereticks could, and
did pretend unto the Scriptures. Now
what evidence can ye give from the

                     <p>I offer to answer directly
to his Argument without Retortion,
though I pass not from the Retortion;
for it stands over your heads, which ye
will never get over. Then I say, we
have a two-fold evidence, which no
Heretick can justly lay claim to. The
one is the inward evidence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, by its own immediate Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
in our hearts. The other is the
Testimony of the Scriptures, which I
affirm in the Name of the People called
<hi>Quakers,</hi> is the best external and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
evidence, and rule that can be
given: And my reason why we have
the Testimony of the Scriptures, as an
evidence that we have the Inspiration
of the Spirit, is this. All Men have a



<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46415:9"/>
measure of the Inspiration of the Spirit of
God according to the Scriptures testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
That Christ the true Light inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth
every man that cometh into the
world; and that a manifestation of the
Spirit is given to every man to profit
withal: But this universal Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or manifestation is inspired; and if
all men be in measure inspired, then
consequently we who are men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired.</p>

                     <p>I prove yee have not the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Scriptures for a sufficient
evidence. That which is fallacious is
not a sufficient evidence. But the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
testimony according to the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi>
without the indwelling of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

therefore I desire to be heard,
that I may open it more sufficiently, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as is provided in the Articles of

                     <p>Objective Revelation, or the object
of our faith is twofold, to wit, first, the
material object; secondly the formal
object.</p>

                     <p>I shall explain it to them, for
it is necessary to the matter in hand.
The material object is that which is to
be believed; the formal object is that
for which principally we are to believe,
or the principal motive of credibility.
Now to apply, I say, the Scriptures are
the material object, or a part of the
ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>erial object of our faith; but not
the formal object of our faith.</p>

                     <speaker>Al. Shir.</speaker>
                     <p>I prosecute my Argument

                     <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
                     <p>We confess the Scriptures are
sufficient to move us to an Historical
faith, and that to a more excellent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Historical faith, than any other
Histories in the world; because it hath



<pb n="23" facs="tcp:46415:12"/>
more excellent outward motives of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility,
as the consent of all ages since
they were written, and of all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
however differing among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they are not sufficient

                     <speaker>Al. Shir.</speaker>
                     <p>I prove such inward ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective
Revelations are not necessary to
beget saving faith, by this Argument:
If there be no such Seed in man as the
<hi>Quakers</hi> maintain, then there are no
such Revelations as the <hi>Quakers</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
But there is no such Seed in men
as the <hi>Quakers</hi> maintain: Therefore
there are no such Revelations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <speaker>A. Shir.</speaker>
                     <p>I prove it. If there be no

in men as the <hi>Quakers</hi> maintain: But
the first is true, therefore the last. And
then the said <hi>Alexander Shirreffe</hi> read a

I am necessitated to put my hand

a substantial Principle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I say, that
is altogether extrinsick to the subject of
the debate; and besides it will engage
us into the greatest nicities and obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Philosophy and School-divinity,
that is not proper for this Auditory.
But if by such thou meanest, An Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Principle of Gods saving Grace
in men, whereby they are capacitated
both to know and do the will of God;
I affirm and am ready to maintain there
is such a Principle in all men.</p>

                     <p>But I prove that that Seed

in men is not of a substance, or substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Principle.</p>

                     <p>I am ready to defend, that it
is a substantial Principle. But that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the second Proposition, we
ought not to come to it before the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of the first Proposition be
discussed. Here the Students made a
great noise. And <hi>G. K.</hi> appealed to the

that <hi>G. K.</hi> did not refuse to
defend that the Seed of God was a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial

<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and I offer to prove, that
there is not a Seed of God in men, as
the <hi>Quakers</hi> affirm, if there be such a
Seed, it is either created, or uncreated:

                     <p>After he repeated the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:

                     <p>I hope ye understand it, and I
shall explain it to them, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
it not. A Concrete Term com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth
two things; the one in <hi>recto</hi>
(as they say) the other in <hi>obliquo,</hi> that
is to say, the one hath the other belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to it, as merciful is a Concrete
Term, which is as much as to say, one
that hath mercifulness in him, and so
mercifulness is the Abstract, which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
that one thing belonging to the
Concrete. Now to apply: If we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
<hi>Seed</hi> as the Concrete, it is both
uncreated and created; for it is God
himself discovering himself to the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
capacity, in his work of manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station,
which work is created; but he
who doth manifest himself in that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
is uncreated. And because
he manifests himself at first in a low

respect of his <hi>manifestatione quoad nos</hi>
(or as to us) that is to say, as he comes
forth as to us, discovering himself, he or
his Spirit may be said to have measures.
And this I shew from Scripture: As
where it is said in <hi>Iohn</hi> concerning
Christ, God gave not the Spirit by



<pb n="29" facs="tcp:46415:15"/>
measure unto him; implying he gave
it forth in measures unto others; and

                     <p>He doth come forth into the

he is in all Creatures, and in himself al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so;

that he leaveth his own Being; but it is

                     <p>We will go from this to the eleventh
<hi>Thesis,</hi> which <hi>R. B.</hi> read out, and is as
followeth.</p>
                     <p>All true and acceptable worship to God
is offered in the inward and immediate
moving and drwaing of his own spirit,
which is neither limited to places, times, or
persons; for, though we be to worship him
always, in that we are to fear before him;
yet as to the outward signification thereof in
Prayer, Praises or Preachings, we ought
not to do it where and when we will, but
where, and when we are moved thereunto
by the secret Inspirations of his Spirit in
our hearts, which God heareth &amp; accepteth
of, and is never wanting to move us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
when need is, of which he himself
is the alone proper Iudge. All other worship
then, both Praises, Prayers, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
which man sets about in his own will,
and at his own appointment, which he can
both begin and end at his pleasure, do or
leave undone as himself sees meet, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be a prescribed Form, as a Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,



<pb n="32" facs="tcp:46415:17"/>
or Prayers conceived <hi>ex tempore,</hi> by
the natural strength and faculty of the
mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are all but Superstition, will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship,
and abominable Idolatry in the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ight of God, which are to be denied re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
and separated form in this day of
his spiritual arising. However it might
have pleased him who winked at the times
of ignorance, with a respect to the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and integrity of some, and his own
innocent Seed, which lay as it were buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the hearts of men, under that mass
of superstition to blow upon the dead and
dry bones, and to raise some breathings, and
answer them, and that until the day
should more clearly dawn and break
forth.</p>

                     <p>Impulse is not a word used by

                     <p>This contradicts <hi>G. K.</hi> who
in his Book of immediate Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>elation,
saith, That in all things whatsomever,
we ought to have an inspiration of the
Spirit for the doing of the same; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
we cannot do in faith.</p>

                     <speaker>R. B.</speaker>
                     <p>This is another digression and
going from the purpose; for the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
is not how far I contradict ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but what in Reason ye can say
against what I have here affirmed: for
when I shew you before how ye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
your Master, <hi>viz. Iohn Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zies</hi>
in another matter, ye would not
admit it as relevant, though the Case
be alike, alledging it was a Retortion,
ye undertook to dispute against the
Theses; but it seems you find not room
enough there, but ye must run to <hi>G. K.</hi>
his Book for further matter.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
                     <p>I see it is more against <hi>G. K.</hi>
than <hi>R. B.</hi> his Theses that you set
your selves. And therefore <hi>G. K.</hi>
must defend <hi>G. K.</hi> But I say, in this
there is no contradiction between <hi>R. B.</hi>
and me, for there is a two-fold sort of



<pb n="34" facs="tcp:46415:18"/>
Inspirations or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences,
the one
General,<note place="margin">N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>te, divers of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors were displeased with their going from the Theses.</note> the other
Special. The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Influences
are given in general, or common for
the doing of all common or ordinary
Actions, and by the special influences
of the Spirit we are enabled to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
those special duties, as of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
Thanksgiving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now of these
special inspirations or influences <hi>R. B.</hi>
in his Theses is to be understood; and
thus there is no contradiction betwixt
him and me.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>R. B.</speaker>
                     <p>To which I have this to add,
there is a difference betwixt the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the Spirit, as we are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
acted by them in singular and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Acts of Worship, and as we are
generally influenced by the Spirit, in
so far as we come habitually to live and
walk in the Spirit, for in that respect
we may be said to do every thing in the
Spirit, as we grow up into that state,
though there be more particular influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
requisit in matters of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>

                     <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
                     <p>I say further, particular Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
or inspirations of the Spirit are
of several sorts, which are analogous or
proportional to the several sorts of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as Preaching, and Praying are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
sorts of duties. Now the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
influence to Pray, is not to Preach,
and so on the contrary. Also the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
which serve to duties only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as to wait, fear, and love God,
do not serve without a superadded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
to the performance of outward
duties. Therefore every influence is
to respect the duty that it is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>

                     <speaker>A. Shir.</speaker>
                     <p>I prove that such particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
influences are not needful to acts of
worship; thus: If such particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
influences of the Spirit were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
unto outward acts of Worship, then
they were also needful unto inward du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as to waiting, desiring, loving, and
feeling God: but the last is absurd,
therefore the first.</p>

                     <p>Having repeated the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I deny that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
                     <p>Come on with that Argument:
confess, it hath some <hi>Acumen</hi> or

sharpness in it; but <hi>ex tua pharetra nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam

                     <speaker>Alex. Shir.</speaker>
                     <p>I prove the last is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd:
If the inspirations of the Spirit
be necessary to inward duties, as to wait,
desire, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then we must not wait with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
them; but this is absurd, therefore
is the other.</p>

                     <p>Having repeated the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
I deny that this is absurd; for
we cannot suppose, that ever at any
time an influence or inspiration can be
wanting to wait upon God, to desire,
and fear, and love him; and the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
influences to particular duties, such
as Praying, Preaching, Thanksgiving is
not wanting, whenever the season com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to go about them.</p>

                     <speaker>Al. Shir.</speaker>
                     <p>If ye have these particular
influences, why do ye not make use of
them? Why do ye not say the

                     <speaker>R. B.</speaker>
                     <p>It will not follow that we do
not pray, nor make use of those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
influences, because at sometimes we



<pb n="37" facs="tcp:46415:19"/>
do not take off our Hats, or speak
words, which are not essential to true
Prayer.</p>

                     <p>I prove that that distinction

is not sufficient, That which may
be a ground for a Heretick to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
Prayer for a whole year is not a
sufficient distinction; but this may be a

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
                     <p>He doth not command us in
all things in which we are inspired; for
some Inspirations are Mandatory, and
commanding, some Permissory, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting;
and some forbidding; so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
commanding and forbidding, the

                     <speaker>I. L.</speaker>
                     <p>But a Permission cannot be an

                     <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
                     <p>I deny the Consequence; for
I offer to shew from Scripture, that <hi>Paul</hi>
when he did a thing by permission was
inspired, as when he said, <hi>I speak this
by permission and not by Commandment.</hi>
Here he was writing
Scripture by inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the very time.<note place="margin">See 1 Cor. 7. 6. &amp; compared with 40. verse.</note>
And again,<note place="margin">See Acts 16. 7.</note> where he
said, I assayed to go
to such a place, but the Spirit permitted
not.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>A. Shir.</speaker>
                     <p>This was not a permission,
but a hindering, or not a permitting
him.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
                     <p>But I gather out of these
words by the Rules of Contraries, that
if the Spirit did not permit <hi>Paul</hi> at
sometimes, it did permit him at other
times, and this permission was by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration,
and I hope it is lawful for me
to make this observation or note upon
this Scripture; seeing your Masters will



<pb n="40" facs="tcp:46415:21"/>
make half a dozen not so much to the
purpose. But for the further opening
of this matter, I distinguish of permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
thus: There is a negative permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and a positive permission: A ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
permission is a simple forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
or not medling in any case; and
such a negative permission is no suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
warrant to us to do any thing. The
positive permission is when God by
some inward evidence or signification
of his Spirit by words or otherwise, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
us know that he alloweth us to do
such a thing, although he command it
not. As for Example, if a Scholar
should go forth out of the School with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
getting of his Masters leave, this
is a negative permission, and is not a
sufficient ground for the Scholar to go
forth: but when the Scholar cometh, and
saith. Let me go forth; and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
answereth, thou mayest go, this is
a positive permission, and not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>

                     <p>That is but a Grammaticism,
for the Imperative Mood doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

to command, and sometimes to
permit; which I refer to the judgment

                     <p>Then let me read the Thesis,
which was read, and is as followeth:</p>
                     <p>As there is one Lord and one faith, so
there is one Baptism, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 5. which
is not the putting away of the filth of the
flesh, but the answer of a good Conscience
before God by the Resurrection of Iesus
Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. and this Baptism is
a holy and spiritual thing (to wit) the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of the Spirit and fire, by which we
are buried with him, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
washed and purged from our sins we
may walk in newness of life, Rom. 6. 4.
of which the Baptism of <hi>John</hi> was a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure,
which was commanded for a time, and
not to continue for ever: As to the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
of Infants is a meer humane Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for which neither precept nor practice
is to be found in all the Scripture.</p>

                     <p>It is true, and therein we agree,

that sprinkling of

                     <speaker>R. B.</speaker>
                     <p>Come on, we mean it is cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>

                     <speaker>P. G.</speaker>
                     <p>I prove it is not ceased thus:
If the presence of Christ is to continue
with his Church for ever, then Water-baptism
is to continue for ever, But the
first is true. Therefore the second.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
                     <p>People take notice, he saith,
Water-baptism is to continue for ever;
if so, then we must be baptized in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
after this life with Water-baptism.</p>

                     <p>Having repeated the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P. G.</speaker>
                     <p>I prove it from <hi>Matth. 28. Go
teach and baptize all Nations,</hi> &amp;c. Here
Christ commanding them to baptize,
sheweth he will be with them to the end
of the world; therefore as long as he
was to be with them, that Baptism
was to continue.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>R. B.</speaker>
                     <p>I grant the whole: but the
Question is, if that Baptism be by Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which I deny.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P. G.</speaker>
                     <p>I prove it was by water, If the
Apostles baptized with water, then they
were commanded to baptize with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
but the Apostles baptized with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
Therefore they were commanded
to baptize with water.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>R. B.</speaker>
                     <p>(having repeated the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P. G.</speaker>
                     <p>I prove it thus, Either the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
did baptize with water by the
Command of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. or they
were ignorant of the meaning of that
Command, chuse you whether.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:46415:23"/>
                     <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
                     <p>It is not a sufficient enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for they might have known the
meaning of the Command, and yet bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
with water, not from that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
but in condescention to the
weaknesses of the Jews.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>P. G.</speaker>
                     <p>If they condescended to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
with water for the weakness of the
Jews though without a Command, then
ye ought to baptize now with water to
condescend to peoples weakness now,
seeing ye confess that there are who
are weak both among us and your
selves.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>G. K.</speaker>
                     <p>That will not follow, more
than in the Case of Circumcision, for
the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did Circumcise without
a Command in condescention to the
Jews, yet it followeth not that any now
should Circumcise to condescend to the
people who should require it.</p>

                     <speaker>Stud.</speaker>
                     <p>The parity is not alike, because
Baptism with water was Commanded
to the Apostles, so not Circumcision; for
<hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was sent to baptize with
water.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was not an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,



<pb n="46" facs="tcp:46415:24"/>
and so not concerned in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. And his Baptism
was to decrease, that the Baptism of

the least violence to our opposers on

had been disputing in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
instead of interposing themselves
to prevent, stood divers of them laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

to be according to their best memory a

will we hope serve to appease
these empty clamours which the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
vain ostentation, and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and prejudice of others might
have raised, some of whom did so little
or at least will needs appear so little to
understand the matter, as to affirm the
Quakers were all routed, for they could
prove nothing, whereas we were by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
agreement to be meer Defendents,
&amp; not to be admitted at all to prove, but
only to answer, and whether we answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not all was urged, will by this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
appear, where none of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
are omitted, nor any whit of
the strength of them concealed; as for
what was or may be accounted reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we have not put them in the body
of the dispute, because we remember not



<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46415:28"/>
particularly at what time they were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
But that we may not seem design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
to conceal any as tending to our
disadvantage, so far as we remember
they were as followeth. That <hi>G. K.</hi> said
to <hi>I. L.</hi> he spoke more with his fingers
than his tongue, after, what need he
make such a work with his finger, and
affect a canting tone like his Master
<hi>I. M.</hi> that his head was too full of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,
and his heart in his tongue, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
as a wise mans tongue is in his heart.
Now whether <hi>I. L.</hi>'s. extravagant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
did not deserve such checks
while he oftentimes would be speaking
when his companions were, and put
them by with both his elbows, that he
alone might be heard, to which add his
forwardness in his blasphemous asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
above observed, let the discreet and
judicious hearers judge. <hi>A. Shir.</hi> said
he would overturn Quakerisme and he
hoped in so doing to have his end. <hi>I. L.</hi>
that he might not miss to hit as he
thought. <hi>G. K.</hi> said it seemed, he was
an <hi>Aberdeens</hi> man and would take his
word again, which was noted by <hi>G. K.</hi>
as being a reflection upon the City



<pb n="53" facs="tcp:46415:28"/>
where <hi>I. L.</hi> himself was born, which
<hi>G. K.</hi> was not, also <hi>A. Shir.</hi> laughing
and raising lightness called upon <hi>G. K.</hi>
speaking some words if there was a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar
that he might take Instrument.</p>
                  <p>To which <hi>R. B.</hi> answered, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
the Notar might take Instrument,
how Divinity Students and Masters, of

in Religious matters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But however
if they have gotten such a Victory as
they boast of, how is that consistent
with what we are informed of, and is
noised up and down in the City, that
<hi>Io. Menzies</hi> their Master went within a
day or two to desire the Bishop to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain

and procure us to be punished for hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Dispute; &amp; an Order that none
such further be admitted; and indeed
if the Scholars have proved so good Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putants,

                  <p>AS in this late Rencountre it was
specially provided, that it shall
be abstract from the Challenge made to
you, and so no fulfilling of it; so now
this being past, of which you have here
presented to you a good and faithful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
which we hope being seriously
weighed by your more mature Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
may allay any hasty joy that
might have proceeded from the windy
Triumphs the Students might have pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
you with a belief they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
who at every turn to the nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seating
of the more serious and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Auditors, were proclaiming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Victors, we think you more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned;
and indeed we are the more
desirous to meet and debate it with your
selves; for either this is all ye have to
say, which ye have put in their mouths,



<pb n="55" facs="tcp:46415:29"/>
or ye have more to say; if this be all,
then indeed it may be your wisdom not
to accept this offer; but if ye have
more, we shall be willing to hear it, and
endeavour to answer it; and as your
appearing your selves would be more
satisfactory to the people, and is most
desired by them as well as us; so divers
inconveniencies that hath in this, or may
fall in the like would be avoided; for
first, it being in your publike houses,
there would be less occasion of tumult,
because the house is capable to hold di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
thousands. Secondly, as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
ye would not so readily be put to
a stand as they, if it should happen ye
were: we are hopeful ye would not by
raising a laughter and clamour amongst
the people, and crying out three or four
at once, seek to cover it, or boast of
Victory, and cry out your Argument
is pungent before we have time allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
us to answer it. Thirdly, you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
we are hopeful to procure dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet,
Learned, and persons every way
considerable to be Judges consultative
upon our part, though not professing
our way, to help to moderate and keep



<pb n="56" facs="tcp:46415:30"/>
good order. Fourthly, it is probable;
that by the solemnity of such an action
and the influence of your presence, as
well as other persons of condition being
there, might secure us from the hazard
of clods, and stones; for I do truly assure
you, I conceive my self more able to
answer the most pungent of your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
than defending my self from the
stones and blows of your unreasonable
and brutish Church-Members. It is by
some of your people objected to us
(whether it come from you or not I
will not affirm) that it is below you to
engage with us; but as this is altogether
unsutable to Christian Ministers, whose
Mr. disdained not daily to debate, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Questions of such as opposed
themselves unto him, and taught his
Disciples to leave the ninety and nine,
and go seek after the odd one. Next it
is most unreasonable, for since ye take
liberty to speak against us in your Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits,
and particularly to designe us, yea
&amp; sometimes to speak untruths of us. I
desire then to know whether it be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Rules of Christianity, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of common honesty, to take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty



<pb n="97" facs="tcp:46415:30"/>
to speak ill of men behind their
backs, abuse their Principles and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and yet say it is below them to
prove these Charges to the mens own
faces. Secondly, it is objected, that it
is against the Laws to call the faith e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
by Law into question; but
may not the same be said against Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
in those Nations where Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
and Mahomitism are established by
Law; yea, is not this the very pretence
and put off which the Papists both in
<hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>France</hi> gave the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Protestants, when they desired pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
conferences with them? And was not
both the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and
his Brother <hi>Ferdinando</hi> sorely checkt by
divers Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> for granting
these Conferences? and the Queen-Mother
of <hi>France</hi> openly reproved and
cried out against by Cardinal <hi>Turnon</hi>
and other Clergy-men, sor giving way
to that of <hi>Poysy,</hi> as suffering the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
faith of the Church to be called in
quest on, which had been established by
many Laws, &amp; for afar longer time than
the Profession we oppose. It seems ye
defend your selves chiefly by Popish



<pb n="58" facs="tcp:46415:31"/>
Weapone, as will anon further appear:
in order whereunto I shall speak a word
or two to <hi>Iohn Menzies,</hi> and so make
an end. The greatest and frequentest
Argument that both thy Scholars and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
make against us, is, that we have
no certain evidence by which we can
make known that we are led by the
Spirit that Hereticks and others cannot
pretend to. Now if this may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
as relevant or strong against us,
I desire thou wouldst be pleased to shew
me how thou canst extricate thy self out
of the same difficulty, when urged by
the Jesuit <hi>Dempster,</hi> that the Scripture
which thou assigned as the ground of
the Protestant Religion is an evidence
for you, seeing all Hereticks also pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to it? Let me see what difficulties
occur in our Case as to the Spirit, which
likewise occurs not the same very
way in yours, as to the Scripture. For
(besides that we have as good ground to
lay claim to the Scriptures as your
selves, and are ready, and I hope able
to prove our Principles from them as
well as your selves. If ye say men may
be deceived by a seducing Spirit, What



<pb n="59" facs="tcp:46415:31"/>
then? will it therefore follow that the
Spirit of God will deceive any, or that
men ought not to be guided by it, more
than because many men have been and
are deceived by a misunderstanding and
wrong use of the Scripture, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Scripture doth deceive people,
or ought not to be the Rule? If it be
said divers men pretending to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
contradict one another, doth not the
same recur as to the Scriptures? What
greater contradictions can there be than
there is betwixt certain Churches both
acknowledging the Scriptures to be the
Rule? Hast thou forgotten (<hi>Iohn</hi>) how
thou and thy Elder Brother <hi>Andr. Cant,</hi>
who both affirmed the Scripture to be the
only certain Rule, &amp; yet oftentimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the same Auditory in the same Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit
did from the very same <hi>ver.</hi> of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Ps 93. 5. Holiness becometh thy house
O Lord, for over,</hi> draw different and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory
Doctrines, Uses and Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations?
If that then will not infer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to you the Scriptures to be an
uncertain Rule; neither will the other
as to the Spirit. If it be said that the
same man pretending to be guided by



<pb n="60" facs="tcp:46415:32"/>
the Spirit, hath been of different Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
doth not the same also recur as
to the Scriptures? Or need we go fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Iohn,</hi> than thy self to prove this,
who hath all along acknowledged the
Scripture to be the Rule, and yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
judged the Congregational way to
be preferable to the Presbyterian, &amp; then
the Presbyterian better then Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and now the Episcopal preferable
to both? Or tell me, <hi>Iohn,</hi> honestly, did
the Scripture deceive thee when thou
preached upon that Text, <hi>Why mournest
thou for Saul?</hi> If thou say thou only
here misunderstood the place, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied
it; yet is the Scripture for-all
that true and certain; may not the same
be said, if one pretending the Spirit to
be the Rule, should fall in the like error
that the Spirit were not to be blamed,
or thence termed uncertain: but the
man that mistook the voice thereof, or
took his own imaginations instead
of it, as thou didst thy misapprehensions
for the sense of that Scripture. If thou
canst extricate thy self out of these diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
so as to satisfie me, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rational and indifferent person, I



<pb n="61" facs="tcp:46415:32"/>
may seriously say to thee according to
the Proverb, <hi>Eris mihi magnus Apollo.</hi>

appear to all judicious and unprejudicate
persons that <hi>Iohn Menzies</hi>'s Arguments
against the <hi>Quakers</hi> are no other than
the Jesuits against him; and whatever
way he can defend himself against the
Jesuites, so the <hi>Quakers</hi> can do against
him, and impugn and straiten him the
same way, so that his Argument is like
the Vipers brood, that destroys him that
brings it forth. I say, if this appear,
what may candid persons judge of <hi>Iohn
Menzies</hi> honesty that has asserted in
Print, that Quakerism is Popery un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a disguise; and the Papists and <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>

                  <p>The state of the Controversie in the

yours is in <hi>Thesis</hi> and not in <hi>hypothesi,</hi> that
is not whether or not we be truly ruled
by the Spirit, or can give an evidence of
it, more than whether ye be truly led by

                     <head>A Postscript.</head>
                     <p>AS the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> said concerning
the Spirit of God, that <hi>there are
diversity of operations, but one Spirit, and
one body of Christ, which is his Church;</hi>
so I may say concerning Antichrist, and
his spirit and body. The body of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
is but one, having many members;
and the spirit of Antichrist is but one in
the root, though in different operations, &amp;
appearances. And what is this body of
Antichrist, but all these (whether <hi>Papists</hi>
or others, though pretending to Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
under what soever designation, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal,
Presbyterian, Independent, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi>
or any else) who oppose the Spirit
of Christ in his spiritual appearances
and operations in the body of Christ,
which is his Church. A manifest instance
of the truth of this, I my self of late
have been an ear and eye witness of.
For not many months ago I'had occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at <hi>London,</hi> both to see with my eyes,



<pb n="64" facs="tcp:46415:34"/>
and hear with my ears, how the people
called <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> some of their chief
Teachers, opposed, denied, slighted, and
(by all means their earthly and devilish
wisdom could invent) laboured to make
of none effect the inward evidence of
the Spirit of God in his people, alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
openly in the faces of thousands, That
whoever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ould not give an evidence to
their Adversaries, that they were inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with the Spirit of God such as no
hereticks could pretend to, were no
Christians but deceivers. So these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists
lately argued against us at
<hi>London</hi> in an open Assembly. And so
now since in my own native Country
within these few days, I have seen the
same Spirit to appear in men professedly
very much differing from Anabaptists,
and slighting them as a sort of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
yet one with them in the ground;
and in this particular work and service
also, to carry on the great designe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist.
These are some Masters of
Arts, Students of Divinity, as they call
themselves, in the University of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene,</hi>
who openly in the hearing of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
hundreds of people, some whereof



<pb n="65" facs="tcp:46415:34"/>
were sober and judicious, did oppose
the inward evidence of the Spirit of
God in his people, as not being a sufficient
evidence unto them, unless they could
give an evidence of it unto others, even
their very Adversaries, that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired;
and so if we the people called
<hi>Quakers</hi> could not give an evidence of
this unto these our opposes, we were but
deceivers. After it had been shewn them,
that Papists &amp; Jesuits used the same Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
against all the Protestants, that
indeed did more militat against them, out
of the Papists Quiver, than out of these
our Adversaries Quiver against us. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the Testimony of the Scripture, as
the best and most convincing outward
evidence that could be given, as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to the Doctrine and Principle of
Immediate Revelation and Inspiration
of the Spirit of God, owned by us, as
being in all men in some measure, and
consequently in us. This is, I say, not
the the best and most principal evidence,
nor the greatest, that we have unto out
selves, or unto one another, who are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
into the same Faith, Spirit, and
Power, for that is the immediate evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence



<pb n="66" facs="tcp:46415:35"/>
of the Spirit in our hearts, which
witnesseth both to our selves and to one
another, that we are the Children of
God; but it is (I mean the Scripture)
the greatest outward and visible evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that can be given unto our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries,
who in words own the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as their only Rule, and chiefest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences.
And in doing so, I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the example of our Lord and
Saviour Jesus Christ, who while he
reasoned against the Jews, who profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to own the Scriptures, but denied
him; he brought a testimony for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
out of the Scriptures, which they in
words owned as their Rule; <hi>Search</hi> (said
he) or ye <hi>search the Scriptures, for in them
ye think ye have eternal life, and these are
they, which testifie of me.</hi> Now though
Christ his own immediate Testimony
should have been received as greater
than any of his Servants, such as <hi>Moses,</hi>
and the Prophets were, yet he used this,
as an Argument against them, as bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to their own Rule; and said he,
<hi>had ye believed Moses, ye would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
me, for Moses wrote of me.</hi> And he
said again, <hi>I have a greater testomony than



<pb n="67" facs="tcp:46415:35"/>
that of Iohn:</hi> and yet <hi>Iohn</hi> was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
of all the Prophets. So in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
we say, We have a greater testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to Christ Jesus by his Spirit, and
Power revealed in us, than the testimony
of <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, even than
<hi>Ioh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>,</hi> who was the greatest. But when we
produce the Testimony of <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; the
Prophets and Apostles as an evidence to
the truth of what we affirm, I say it
should be received by our Adversaries
who own the Scriptures as their chief
and only Rule. For either they should
receive it, or not receive it; if they
should receive it then they are faulty,
who in the late Dispute at <hi>Aberdene</hi> did
refuse to receive the evidence of the
Scriptures, as from us, only because we
say we have a greater, to wit, that of
the Spirit within us, although we own
the Scripture as the greatest visible and
outward evidence that we can give to
our Adversaries. If they should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Scripture-evidence and testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
as from us, because we say we
have a greater, to wit, that of Christ
himself immediately in us by his Spirit,
then they must needs also say, for the



<pb n="68" facs="tcp:46415:36"/>
same reason, that the Jews ought not to
receive the testimony of the Scriptures
as an evidence for Christ, because he
said he had a greater; and certainly he
had a greater, though they would not
receive it, nor could not, as they stood
in their prejudice and malice, werewith
they were filled against him, who did not
receive him.</p>
                     <p>Now this I say with freedom and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Spirit to all those whether Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
Anabaptists, Prelatical or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian
Professors, who with one mouth
require of us an evidence that we are
infpired, or have a measure of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
of the Spirit of God and
Christ in us; I offer unto all of you <hi>the
Scriptures</hi> for an evidence of this truth,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Quakers</hi> so called have a
measure of the Inspiration of the Spirit
of God and Christ in them; for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Scriptures testimony, Christ
the true Light enlighteneth every man
that cometh into the world; and his il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination
is his inspiration; I profess
sincerely in Gods fear, that the Scriptures
Testimony is to meas full and plain, and
convincing to prove this Truth, <hi>viz.</hi> that



<pb n="69" facs="tcp:46415:36"/>
an Illumination, Manifestation, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration
of the Spirit of God is given
to every man, is in every man; as to
prove this truth, that Christ, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the flesh, was born of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> was the promised <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah;</hi>
now if we can prove from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that all men have in them a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of this Divine Illumination and
Inspiration by the Spirit of Christ, we
have gained our point, which is, that we
have also a measure of the same in us;
for <hi>ALL MEN</hi> doth comprehend us
called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as well as other men:
I see not what our Adversaries can with
any colour object against this evidence
from Scripture, but this, that they will
deny that the Scripture bears testimony
to this Universal Illumination or Inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Spirit of God in men. But this
brings the matter of the debate from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
personal to be doctrinal, &amp; so puts us
upon equal terms at least, with all our
Adversaries, especially Prelatical, Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptistist,
and Presbyterian, &amp; Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
opposers whatsoever, who say, the
Scriptures are their chief and only Rule.



<pb n="70" facs="tcp:46415:37"/>
And though our Adversaries say,
the Scripture doth not testifie to that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Inspiration of the Spirit of
Christ in men, that moveth us not more
then when the Jews denied that the
Scriptures bore testimony to him, that
was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be the
Christ. We are able by the help of
God to prove from Scripture the truth
of this Doctrine of Divine Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
and Inspiration in all men,
and consequently in the <hi>Quakers</hi> as
much as they, or any professing Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
upon earth, can prove any Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
or Doctrine of their Faith. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
we are able, and do offer by
the Grace of God against all our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
whatsoever, to prove from the
Scriptures Testimony, that this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Inspiration and Illumination of
Christ by his Spirit in men is a sufficient
evidence of Truth, and Rule of Faith
and Life in all men, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
in us called <hi>Quakers.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that this Divine Inspiration
and Illumination, where it is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
resisted and rejected, but regarded
and attended, is a greater evidence



<pb n="71" facs="tcp:46415:37"/>
than the Scripture is, and witnessed by
the Scriptures. Fourthly, and yet the
Scripture is the greatest visible and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
evidence that either we or they
can give of their Rule.</p>
                     <p>I shall conclude with a reasonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
to these Young men, Masters of

is this, Whether they own these Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
