         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>then: Marke</hi>
saith, chap. 1. 9. <hi>in those dayes,</hi>
inferring it (as <hi>Mathew</hi>) vpon
<hi>Iohns</hi> ministerie: when <hi>Iohn</hi> had
enflamed the people with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
affection and desire to see
Christ, whom he had so highly
preferred aboue himselfe; when
the mindes of men were so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient
of delay in this expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Messiah, as they
would haue giuen this honour
to <hi>Iohn</hi> himselfe, <hi>then</hi> came Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus.
2. Then when <hi>Iohn</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
the people with the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:2377:4"/>
of repentance, had smoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
the way to Christ, had cast
downe high mountaines of
pride, and had humbled men,
<hi>then</hi> most fitly commeth Christ:
so Luk. 3. 21. when as all the
people were baptized, then
Christ was baptized. 3. <hi>Then</hi>
when Iesus began to be about
thirty yeeres of age, (saith <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.
23.) at which age the Leuiticall
Priests were admitted to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
ministry, and not before:
for <hi>Iohn</hi> began in the fifteenth of
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> and all consent that he
was borne in the fifteenth of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus.</hi>
1. Note hence the truth
of Scripture,<note place="margin">Consent of Scripture.</note> and consent with it
selfe; this circumstance letteth
vs see the accomplishment of
two prophesies, the <hi>former</hi> in
Malach. 4. 5. that <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi>
must goe before Christ in the
spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> that preaching
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:2377:4"/>
that saluation which Christ now
brought after him, men might
better both take notice, and giue
better entertainement to him,
whom now all expected: the
<hi>latter</hi> in Malach. 3. 2. that after
this Messenger is sent, the Lord
must speedily come to his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
this <hi>Marke</hi> expresseth plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
chap. 1. 19. that when <hi>Iohn</hi> was
committed to prison, then came
Christ into Galile preaching;
and Math. 4. 12. when Iesus
heard, that <hi>Iohn</hi> was deliuered
vp, he returned into Galile: see
Act. 1. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>Whence learne, that the wise
prouidence of God guideth not
only al actions,<note place="margin">Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence guideth all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances as well as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> but all the circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of them also. Eccles. 3. 1.
To euery thing there is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
time; whatsoeuer is
done, suffered, enioyed, whether
naturall, voluntary, or inuolun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:2377:5"/>
it hath a set time wherein
it is beautifull and comely. But
especially euery vision and word
of God is for an appointed time,
Habak. 2. 3. and though long,
yet at length euery promise, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
threat, euery prediction shall
come to his iust period and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance.
There was a due and
appointed time, when Christ
was to be incarnate, that is, the
fulnesse of time, Gal. 4. 4. and
<hi>then</hi> God sent his Son made of
a woman: There was an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
time to vndertake his
ministry, when way was made
for him by <hi>Iohns</hi> ministry: There
was an appointed time to finish
his worke in, an houre for the
power of darknesse to worke in,
before which time, though they
could take vp stones against
him, they could not throw them
at him, but, when his houre
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:2377:5"/>
was come, he went out to meete
them. There was an appointed
time, in which he was to be laid
in the house of death, after
which three dayes he could not
be held. And as it was with
him, so is it with the children of
God by adoption, no thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls
them but in Gods time,
which they must waite and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
not prescribe. Wantest
thou any good thing? waite
Gods leasure as <hi>Abraham</hi> did:
Art thou in misery vnder any
euill present, or in feare of euill
to come? patiently expect the
Lords set time; sowe prayers,
sowe teares, thou shalt reape in
due time if thou faint not; only
make not haste. <hi>Lazarus</hi> must
not be raised till the fourth day,
nor Christ himselfe til the third.
Times and seasons are in his
hands, for the Father hath put
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:2377:6"/>
them in his owne power.</p>
            <p>Againe, let vs be wise in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
and entertaining his sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
hee hath appointed vs a
time of mercy, a day of visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a time when he is neere and
may be found, a time when with
the wise virgins we may enter, a
time when the blessing may be
obtained: and there is another
time when if wee seeke with
teares we shall not obtaine it, as
<hi>Esau.</hi> This present day is our
day; now know God, enter fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with him, beleeue his
word, obey his voice, and in this
thy day follow the things of thy
peace.</p>

the necessary conditions is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy:
But yet sometimes there
may be a change of one calling
into another, as in these cases:
1. For priuate necessity; as when
a man is disabled from his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
as suppose, not suffered to
execute it; or else hindred by
sicknesse, age, or any incurable
disease; or when one calling is
not sufficient for his honest
maintenance; or when a calling
is out of request; or the worke
of it is hindred: now a man may
lawfully cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge his calling, good
aduice and prayer going before.
2. For the publique good, as
when a priuate man is called to
be a Magistrate in a society; and
thus Christ changed his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and of a priuate man is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by his Father to be a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
person, euen the Mediator
betweene God and man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:2377:8"/>
But why is the Euangelist so<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
diligent in the accurate descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
of the places where these
things were done?</p>
            <p>For these reasons.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> 1. For the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> trueth of the History. 2. Christ
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were by Gods proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
brought vp in seuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
so distant, as one knew not
the other, till Christ came to his
baptisme. This was so by Gods
appointment, lest the Pharises
should slander them, as if there
were a collusion or plot between
them: and therefore, Ioh. 1. 32.
<hi>Iohn</hi> professed he knew him not,
otherwise than by the signe
which God gaue him, <hi>On whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
thou shalt see the Spirit des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
and abide, that is he,</hi> ver. 33. it
had not been fit for <hi>Iohn</hi> to haue
spoke so much as he did of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
and knowne friend: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
Christ sent Disciples to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2377:8"/>
               <hi>Iohn,</hi> to shew him what was
done: The blinde see, the deafe
heare, and the poore receiue
the Gospell, &amp;c. 3. Nazareth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
was an obscure village, not fitted
for this worke which Christ
would haue to be done, not in a
secret or remote place out of
mens eyes, but in publique and
in sight of all the people; for so
<hi>Luke</hi> saith, that when all the
people were baptized, Christ
was baptized; hee would not
creepe into his office, but would
be solemnly and openly inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
that men and Angels
might take notice of him.
4. The Lord must come to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
temple, as <hi>Malachi</hi> prophesied,<note place="margin">Malac. 3. 1.</note>
and <hi>to his owne,</hi> Ioh. 1. 11. Now
the place where <hi>Iohn</hi> preached,
was in Iudea: for Palestina was
diuided into three parts, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lile,
Samaria, and Iudea; now
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2377:9"/>
Iudea was the place, wherein
Christ was especially to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse,
and therefore it was meete
he should be there called and set
out: that was the place fittest
for <hi>Iohn</hi> to performe his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
towards him, whom he must
make knowne to <hi>Israel,</hi> &amp; point
at as the Lamb of God, Ioh. 1. 31.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. Christ made choise of Iordan,
a famous riuer where <hi>Naaman</hi>
was clensed from his leprosie,
2. Kings 5. 14. and which riuer
those famous Prophets <hi>Eliah</hi>
and <hi>Elisha</hi> had deuided with
their cloke,<note place="margin">Congruè Iordane: quia sicut per illud flumen silij Israel tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sierunt ad terram pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missam, sic per baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum fideles transeunt ad terram viuentium.</note> 2. King. 2. 8, 13. For
speciall reason, 1. for whereas
the Israelites about 1500. yeeres
before passed ouer on dry land,
vnder the conduct of <hi>Ioshua,</hi>
vnto the land of Canaan: about
the very same place did the true
<hi>Ioshua,</hi> our Iesus, fulfill that type:
for at Bethabara (signifying the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2377:9"/>
house of passage ouer, in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of that famous passage:) did
<hi>Iohn</hi> baptize Christ; secondly,
there were the waters diuided
againe; that way might be made
for our passage into our hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

aboue, Heb. 10. 20. Thirdly, there
the Arke of God stood in Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
Iosh. 3. 17. Now our Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory
descends into Iordan.
Fourthly, there God magnified
<hi>Ioshua</hi> that day before all Israel:
here God magnifies our Iesus
to all the Israel of God, giuing
such testimony vnto him as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
was giuen to any creature.
Fiftly, Iordan was but simple,
pure and common water, fittest
for baptisme, not mixt or distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
and Christ will be baptized
with no better, to shew that the
words of Institution leaue no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
holinesse in the water af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2377:10"/>
the vse; Iordan after this was
a common floud &amp; vsed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
vses, and so any thing may
bee done with the water after a
child is baptized. Neither find
we to this Iordan-water, added
eyther oyle, or salt, or creame, or
spittle, or any such other deuice.</p>
            <p>But why doeth Christ come
to <hi>Iohn?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Quest.</note> the Lord to the seruant?<note place="margin">Dommus ad seruum, lux ad lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernam, sol ad Lucife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note>
why rather did not Iohn goe to
him? or Christ might haue sent
for him, and commaunded him
to come to him; but he takes a
wearisome iourney vnto him:
for from Nazaret to Bethabara
was about 14. myles.</p>
            <p>Thus carnall reason iudgeth,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
that it had been fittest for <hi>Iohn</hi>
to haue gone into Galile, and
there haue preached and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
if it had bin only for Christs
cause and ease; but Christ in
great wisedome would haue it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:2377:10"/>
otherwise. 1.<note place="margin">Why Christ commeth to Iohn, not Iohn to Christ.</note> In respect of Iohn:
for it was prophecyed before of
him, that hee must be the voice
of a cryer in the wildernes of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,
and he must keepe his place
assigned. 2. That which the first
<hi>Adam</hi> lost from vs by pride, the
second <hi>Adam</hi> would restore to
vs by humility; &amp; in euery thing
debaseth himselfe, and stoopeth
to helpe vs vp being falne: and
therefore hee that was borne in
so meane a condition, &amp; brought
vp in a poore village, out of
which it was a maruell that any
good could come, he sorts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
among the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
commeth to <hi>Iohn</hi> his seruant
like a common man; as before
he was circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cised with the same
knife with others, so now he will
be washed with the same waters,
in a common riuer with others;
he would not be singular, but,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:2377:11"/>
being clothed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same flesh,
would be like other men, except
in sinne, laying aside his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for the time of dispensation.
3. He would hereby honor the
ministry of man, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he submits
himselfe vnto it, and seeketh to
it with much paines and labour.
Whence learne 1.<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 5.</note> To put on
the same minde with our Lord,
who for our good refused the
glory of heauen, and laying dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
aside, would liue a temporal
life among sinners, eate, wash,
<hi>suffer</hi> and dye, and lye in the
graue with and for sinners: Thus
for our owne and others true
good, wee should lay aside our
reputation,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 24</note> as <hi>Moses</hi> refused to
be called the sonne of <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
daughter, to suffer with Gods
people: a strange choyse, yet
when he was of age, stayednesse
and discretion, he made it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:2377:11"/>
2. As he was baptized, not
by an Angell or Prince, but by
an homely man that liued like
an Eremite in an austere man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of life for dyet and clothing,
so must not we account baser of
the sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts for the meannesse
of the man, if a lawfull minister,
seeing Christ refused not the
sacrament at <hi>Iohns</hi> hand; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
must wee from the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
minister, seeing the least in
the Kingdom of God is greater
then <hi>Iohn:</hi> nay, not the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
only, but euen the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of a minister doth not pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
the sacrament to a worthy
receiuer; why? 1. A good mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
doth not make it the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to a bad man: therefore not
a bad minister the worse to a
good man. 2. The efficacy of a
sacrament depends on Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,
on the truth and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:2377:12"/>
of Christ, not on mans good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or badnesse. A message may
bee as truely deliuered by a
bad man, as a good: and good
wax will receiue an impression
as wel by a brazen seale as a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
one. But of this point (God
willing) wee are to deale more
fully elsewhere.</p>
            <p>3. Christ was content to wash
in a common water, in the floud
Iordan; he feared no infection
from it, though <hi>Naaman</hi> the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
were washed there; though
the Pharises &amp; hypocrites wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
there, yet he takes no excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Obesse mali bonis non debent, sed magis mali à bonis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuuari, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian. Epist. synod. 54.</note>
contracts no vncleannesse:
so the wickednesse of another
Communicant doth not preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
him that is rightly prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
though hee communicate
with him in the Sacrament, yet
not in his sinne.</p>
            <p>It maketh indeed for our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2377:12"/>
when we doe receiue with
such as of whose godly life and
conuersation we are perswaded,
because in it wee professe our
selues members &amp; fellow Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
with them, and desire to
be confirmed in that communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Besides, our loue and zeale
may be better stirred vp by the
prayers and example of such, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then by wicked ones: But
notwithstanding, 1. no mans
sin can defile another, or make
Gods promise in vaine, nor the
seale of it, to him that is no way
accessary to it; neither hath
power to hinder him from the
Sacrament. Eze. 18. 20. The same
soule that sinneth, shall dye: &amp;
Gal. 6. 5. Euery man shall beare
his owne burden. 2. Christ not
onely communicated heere in
the seruice of God with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
men, but elsewhere with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2377:13"/>
those assemblies in which were
many notoriously wicked,<note place="margin">Nec propter zizania se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getem Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti, nec prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paleas aream Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti, nec prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vasa in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorata domum magnam Christi, nec propter pis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces malos retia Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti derelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quunt, Aug. cont.

and when he went vp yeerely

Vers. 14. Besides, the Apostles
were continually in the temple,
notwithstanding all grosse cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
in it, Luk. 24. 53. Act.
21. 26. And lastly, we should o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
bee bound not to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
our selues onely, but al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
with whome we commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate:
but the Apostle saith, Let
a man therefore examine <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,</hi>
and so let him eate and
drinke; and, Hee that eateth &amp;
drinketh vnvvorthily,<note place="margin">Non dicit, alijs. sed si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi, Calu.</note> eateth &amp;
drinketh <hi>his owne</hi> damnation,
1. Cor. 11. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>4. Seeing Christ so honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the ministerie of man, who
dare disdaine the holy ministry,
and societie of the Church,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:2377:13"/>
which the Sonne of God sought
vnto? Where be they that think
it too base for them to goe to
Church, to seek the Sacrament?
Oh it is more state to haue Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
come to them into their
houses. Nay, but the Church is
now our Iordan; hither come, or
else thou art more stately than
Christ. How dare great men so
despise our ministerie, which
Christ in his owne person hath
graced, that it is not worthie
their presence?</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> point is, the end of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>

reasons it was fit he should:
for (to omit that giuen here by

becomes vs to fulfill all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes:)
1, as the high Priest
when he was inaugurated, had
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his whole body washed with
water, so would our High Priest
entring, be commended to his
Fathers loue, and care, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
in his office, by the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ministerie of the Church,
that the Truth might be answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to the type. 2. Although
hee vndertooke not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as a Sacrament of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
or as a symbole of new
life, yet hee did, 1. as it was a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2377:14"/>
of Christian societie,
1. Cor. 12. 13. for, as by it the
faithfull are set into his body, so
would hee by it be set into the
body of the Saints, and take on
him the common marke and
priuiledge of his members: euen
as we see Kings and Princes, by
whom all hold their freedome,
will sometimes bee made free,
and so receiue a publike testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of association from their
people: and loe here our Prince
in the colours of a common
souldier. 2. As Baptisme is a
symbole of affliction, so hee
would vndertake it: so Mar. 10.
38. Christ calles his crosse and
death by the name of Baptisme.
3. Christ would bee baptized,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
not to wash himselfe, but vs;<note place="margin">Vnus mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit, sed lauit omnes: Theoph.</note>
not to put off sinne as we, but to

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:2377:15"/>
that hee might sanctifie this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament

also to put an end to legall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and to testifie that we must

he sets seale first in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
4. That in nothing hee
might be vnlike vs, sinne onely
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> excepted, Hebr. 4. 15.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme<note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
of repentance, which
Christ needed not.</p>
            <p>Being sent in the similitude<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
of sinfull flesh, Rom. 8. 3. hee
would not disdaine the marke

might be a most familiar and

among the wicked, yea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
behinde <hi>Barrabas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how could he, no sinner,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
take vpon him the Sacrament,
which is a symbole of remission
of sins, of purification, of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off the old man, and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
on the new?</p>
            <p>1. Hee was content to be as
like sinners as might be,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ no sinner, tooke on him the symbole of remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins</note> and not

tooke the curse of sinne vpon
him in his execrable death, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
not to take a badge of
sinne vpon him in his holy bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.
Admire the Lords humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
who knew no sinne, yet stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
among sinners to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
            <p>2. Of the couenant of grace,
whereof Baptisme is a seale, be
two parts: 1. <hi>On Gods part,</hi> the
promises of grace and remission
of sinnes to beleeuers, with reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2377:16"/>
of nature, &amp;c. and thus
Christ receiued it not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.
2. <hi>On mans,</hi> that is, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
of his seale or badge;
the obligation of our selues to
resigne vp our selues wholly to
him, and his seruice, and become
his: and thus it was meete that
Christ should accept the seale
of the Couenant, that he might
be bound in our name as our
head to fulfill that, which we had
promised, and God required at
our hands by vertue of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant,
<hi>I will be thy God, and thou
shalt be my people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence al the significatiue
actions of Baptisme,<note place="margin">The signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatiue action in Christs baptisme what they betokened</note> applied to
Christ, imply nothing else, but
how hee was resigned vp whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to his Father for vs and in our
stead: as for example: 1. When
Christ descended into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
was signified his descending
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2377:16"/>
from heauen, and humbling of
himselfe, to take flesh, suffer,
and dye in it, chusing rather
to lose his life, than his Father
should lose the obedience of his
Law.</p>
            <p>2. The dipping, sprinkling,
or his abode vnder the water, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
his death and buriall, by
whose power and vertue our old
man is dead and buried, that
is, our corruption of nature is
slaughtered and consumed.</p>
            <p>3. His ascending out from
the water, betokeneth his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
for our iustification, by
the power of which we are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated
and rise to life eternall:
So as it appeares, that what wee
were bound to, Christ hath first
in himselfe performed; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableth
vs also in some measure
here below, but at last by his
grace shall perfectly performe it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:2377:17"/>
in our full holinesse aboue with
himselfe.</p>
            <p>But seeing Christ had been
circumcised,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> his baptisme see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
needlesse.</p>
            <p>Indeed if hee had been a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
man,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> and his baptisme only
personall, this obiection might
seeme the stronger, (although
the Iewes, conuerted by <hi>Peters</hi>
sermon, and already circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
were baptized:) But Christ
as a publike person,<note place="margin">Why Christ was both cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised and bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</note> and head of
the Church, in other respects
was to vndertake both Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
1. To shew himselfe the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> author of all Sacraments, both

the law, which himselfe gaue to

himselfe true man, now of thirty

our brother in the couenant, and

knitting both into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and spirituall house, which is
his Church: And all this is for
vs, that wee might haue sweete

Therefore if Satan or the

            <p>Againe, this is for our instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
to note the excellencie
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2377:19"/>
and dignitie of this Sacrament,
and what esteeme wee ought to
haue it in: the Lord comes to
the seruant a tedious iourney to
seeke it; yet many of vs, when it
is brought to vs, turne our
backes vpon it. What price set
they vpon it, who flye foorth of
the Church, when this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>This I will adde to what I
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2377:19"/>
haue elsewhere largely deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that whosoeuer doe not
present themselues with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence
and meditations, but
runne out carelesly and profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
when Baptisme is admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred,
they be farre from Christs
example, and little comfort can
they haue of their baptisme, but
may well feare, lest those myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and benefits, offred and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to a member of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
belong not to them: for
if they did, they would owne
them, and not runne contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously
from them: as good ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

no good by the Sacrament, in
calling to minde thine owne co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant
made in baptisme, with
the fruite in thy selfe, yet good
order requires thy presence:
1. Because the ordinance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2377:20"/>
not onely to the infants,
parents, and sureties, but to the
whole Congregation, as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring

lookes it should be graced, and
not scorned by turning thy back
vpon it. Were it not a most ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuerent

from the Word? and is it not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
to runne from the Seale? espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the blessed Trinitie being
met to such a purpose, to seale
such benefits to a member of
that Congregation? 3. Thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
is requisite to helpe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant

Congregation in prayer, and in

               <p>Why did he so?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, in respect of Christ.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Hee considered his Maiesty
and greatnesse aboue himselfe,
the Lambe of God, the Sonne
of God, into whose name and
faith all others are baptized.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2377:21"/>
2. Hee considered the purity of
Christ, who had no need of the
Baptisme of repentance; he not
onely had no sinne to be washed
away, but also was the Lambe
that tooke away the sinnes of
the world: where there is no
sinne (thought <hi>Iohn</hi>) there is no
need of repentance, nor remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
nor the sacrament of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, in respect of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
1. He considered his owne
basenesse, <hi>I am not worthy to loose</hi>
his shooe. 2. His own vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and that hee was a sinner,
and <hi>needed to be baptized</hi> of him;
and thought it vnmeet, that a
sinner should wash him that was
no sinner, and more fit, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
should be washed by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in respect of the
people, lest (seeing him bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed)
they should mis-conceiue
of him: as, to be a sinner, and as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2377:21"/>
one of the multitude, needing
the Baptisme of repentance, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
seeing before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were baptized, they came
confessing their sinnes: for this
(in <hi>Iohns</hi> conceit) might both
wrong Christ, and the people,
and weaken the testimony that
himselfe had giuen of him.</p>
               <p>Whether did <hi>Iohn</hi> erre in<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
prohibiting Christ, or no?</p>
               <p>He did:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> for 1. well might he
know, that Christ would not
haue offered, or attempted, or
made so tedious a iourney for
any thing, either vnlawfull or
inconuenient, but what was
most holy, most necessary, both
in respect of his owne calling,
as also others saluation. 2. Our
Sauiour in his answere impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that <hi>Iohn</hi> knew not all that
belonged to his owne vocation.
3. In suffering Christ, hee reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2377:22"/>
his errour.</p>
               <p>Whence we see,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> that men of
great vertues and excellency
may erre, and be good men for
all that. <hi>Iohn</hi> was an excellent
Baptist, of admirable holinesse;
of whom Christ gaue testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
that he was not a reed sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but more than a Prophet;
than whom a greater was not
borne of women; and yet he er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in that, which was neerly
ioyned with his calling. This
we see in <hi>Moses,</hi> the seruant and
friend of God, Exod. 4. 13. who
being called by God, at first (in
humility) disabled himselfe; and
not that onely, but after God
had giuen him satisfaction to all
his doubts, vpon his foure refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals:
1. His owne insufficiency,
and the greatnesse of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
chap. 3. 11. 2. Because they
might enquire after Gods name,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2377:22"/>
ver. 14. 3. The incredulity of the
people, who would not beleeue
him. 4. His owne imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of speech: yet after all this
he refused, and shewed so much
infirmity, as God was very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
euen so angry as a father
could with a child. How did
the Apostles at the Ascension
of Christ still dreame of an
earthly kingdome, Act. 1. 6. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
wilt thou restore the kingdome to
Israel?</hi> And <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 10. 14.
being bid to rise and eate of
things ceremoniall forbidden,
said, <hi>Not so, Lord; for no vncleane
thing hath entred into my lips.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Because God reueales not
all at first to his children,<note place="margin">Reason 1</note> who
must of weake ones grow stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
wee know but in part till
that perfect come; God wil haue
his strength knowne in weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:2377:23"/>
2. That being stil in combat,
they might watch so much the
more, awake out of drowsinesse,
shake off security, not triumph
before victory, nor suffer their
weapons to rust, as fearelesse of
the enemy, but still be in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing
naturall corruption. <hi>Paul</hi>
himselfe needed a prick in the
flesh. This is the reason why all
the Canaanites were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
subdued, Deut. 7. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. To humble vs, and keepe
vs lowe in our owne eyes, when
we see what a gulfe of iniquitie
we are wholy drowned in by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that euen the best by the
best meanes and watch cannot
be free; and consequently, seeing
herein the greatnesse and foule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of sin, we might also behold
the infinite grace of God for his,
Christ remitting it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. That neither themselues
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2377:23"/>
should be puffed vp with their
owne great gifts, nor that others
should entertaine too great an
opinion of the best, as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
the nature of man: nor yet
bee discouraged too much by
indwelling corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, seeing the
best are in the same conflict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it as we are: nor lastly to
feare the preuailing of it, or our
finall falling away by it, seeing
the best haue been preserued by
the power of God to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
notwithstanding their owne
weakenesse.</p>
               <p>5. That it might make for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
Gods greater glory, and Satans
greater confusion, by reseruing
some enemies against the day of
triumph.</p>
               <p>But seeing the best &amp; dearest<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
Saints haue erred, how may we
trust their writings? &amp;, doth not
this call the truth of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2377:24"/>
into question?</p>
               <p>No:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> for the Penmen of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
while they were in their
worke, were directed by infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
assistance of the Spirit both
in speaking and writing. 2. Pet.
1. 21. The holy men of God
spake, as they vvere moued by the
Holy Ghost: though the same
men as men, &amp; out of that vvork,
did faile in iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; practice.
<hi>Ionas</hi> in his prophecy could not
erre, but as a man vvas impote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
in anger, vvhen he savv Niniue
vvas not destroyed. <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2.
Sam. 7. as a priuate man vvas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
in giuing <hi>Dauid</hi> aduice
touching the building of the
Temple. <hi>Peter</hi> erred as a man,
and went not with a right foote,
and vvas vvorthy to be blamed,
Gal. 2. 11.</p>
               <p>First then,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> seeing in the best,
who vvere mirrors in the world,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2377:24"/>
we haue a mirrour of our frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
let vs denie our own strength
as being priuie to our owne
weaknesse, and acknowledge
that as farre as we be exempted
in any thing from errour, it is by
the grace of God, by which wee
stand: and hence will follow,
that wee must apply God by
prayer, that he would not leade
vs into tentation.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> beware of abusing
this doctrine, which wicked men
peruert to their owne destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Oh (say they) the best man
aliue may erre:<note place="margin">Prou. 24. 16.</note> The iust ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
seuen times a day. And so
they make light account of
foule sinnes: but 1. the place in
the Prouerbs is abused: The iust
falles seuen times a day, namely,
into affliction, as the other part
of the opposition sheweth.
2. The godly indeed doe fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2377:25"/>
sinne, but keepe not a course
in it, they goe not on as profane
ones doe. 3. Wee must looke
both at their falles and rising,
as they doe not: <hi>Iohn</hi> continued
not in this errour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> wee see that there is
no iust cause to refuse the word,
because man shewes weaknesse
in any thing; for then Christ
might haue refused the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and we the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
because of our Ministers
frailties: but wee must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that many good Ministers
know not all poynts, and none
haue all perfections: what <hi>Iohn</hi>

and so may they.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I haue need to bee baptized of

                     <hi>Iohn</hi> knew Christ, whom he had neuer seene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> Some haue thought, that
<hi>Iohn</hi> did not know Christ to bee
the Sonne of God, and the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias;
but onely by his speech,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2377:25"/>
gate, and habite, tooke him to
bee some worthy and excellent
man. But 1. it is vnprobable,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
that this worthy Witnesse of
him, who in the wombe sprang
at his presence, as if then he had
knowne him, who had immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly
before preached him to be
so farre aboue himselfe, as that
hee was not worthy to vnloose
his shooe, that hee should not
now know him to be him whom
he preached. 2. If he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
him to haue been onely
some worthy man, hee would
haue thought him fitter to haue
been numbred among Gods
people in their Baptisme, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than haue forbidden him.
3. He must needs know him in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
his greatnes of Deity: for none
could bee greater than not to
need Baptisme, except the Son
of God. 4. He confesseth that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:2377:26"/>
he knew him to bee more, and
greater than a meere man, euen
the Sonne of God, the King and
Sauiour of his people, who only
washeth them with the holy
Ghost, and giueth them life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall,
<hi>I haue need to be baptized
of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How is it then,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> that <hi>Iohn</hi> saith,
chap. 1. 31, 33. that he knew him
not, but by that signe giuen him
by him that sent him, <hi>Vpon who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
thou shalt see the Spirit rest, that is
he:</hi> the which signe was not yet
accomplished, vntill after the
Baptisme of Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> was filled with the holy
Ghost,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> and by the same Spirit
which caused him to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
him in the wombe, before
he had seene his face, was admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
that this was hee whom
he preached. But in that he said,
hee knew him not but by that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:2377:26"/>
signe, hee must bee thus vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood:
1. He knew him not by
face before; for hee had neuer
seene him, for the reason before
alleaged. 2. Though hee had
in some sort knowne him when
hee came to Baptisme, yet hee
knew him not so fully and cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as hee did afterward by that
signe: yea, that former know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
compared with the latter,
is scarce worthy the name of
knowledge, but of ignorance:
for as it was with the fathers and
beleeuers of the old Testament,
so is it heere; Christ was after a
sort known to that ancient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but yet so obscurely, as
compared to that knowledge in
his appearing, it still carryeth
the name of ignorance, Ephes.
3. 9. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of Christs
manifestation in the flesh, saith,
that now that mysterie was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:2377:27"/>
brought to light, which was hid
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the beginning of the world.
The former was a darke know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as in a glasse or picture,
this is face to face, at lest a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
by present. 3. Though
<hi>Iohn</hi> knew him before the signe
by a speciall reuelation, whereby
he was after a sort manifested vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
himselfe, yet was he not so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
confirmed, as that hee
durst preach him to be the man,
though he had preached much
of such a one; and therefore,
Ioh. 1. 34. As soone as hee had
seene the Spirit rest on him, hee
saith, I saw and bare record, that
this is the Sonne of God, &amp; ver.
36. pointed at him with his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
the next day, saying, <hi>Behold
the Lambe of God:</hi> for now hee
was openly manifested by this
signe &amp; others at his baptisme,
not to <hi>Iohn</hi> only, but to all Israel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:2377:27"/>
Out of this knowledge of
Christ and himselfe, hee giueth
this worthy testimony of him, I
haue neede to be baptized of
thee: I came of <hi>Adam,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
pollution: thou didst
not, but wast sanctified of the
holy Ghost to be a sanctifier of
all; Thou art Spirit, I am flesh:
can flesh wash the Spirit? I am a

hee giues testimony to

perfection of all vertues,
namely, whatsoeuer the Law of

rule of all righteousnesse. The
<hi>fulfilling of all righteousnesse</hi> is
perfect and absolute obedience
vnto all Gods holy constitutions

righteousnesse the Law looking

because of the flesh, Rom. 8. 3
God sent his owne Sonne in the

the righteousnesse of the Law
might bee fulfilled in vs, not by

serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, &amp; our sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he was voluntarily subiected

for that <hi>Moses</hi> his law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired:

he came vp to Ierusalem after

He was after this subiect to his

parents, vers. 51. for so the Law
required: and hee that hitherto
had fulfilled all legall rights and
obseruances, now at this time
must vndertake another, which
was yet wanting.</p>
               <p>But what law or ordinance was
there for baptisme,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> to which

               <p>It was decreed by the whole<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
Trinity, 1. That Christ should
bee initiated by this ceremony;
wherein also hee must manifest
himselfe the author of all purity

3. Hee would not onely subiect

vvhereof one branch is the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

               <p>In the righteousnesse,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we stand righteous before
God, are two things: 1. The
merit of it, and whole perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance;
and thus by his satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and obedience, he alone
procureth perfect righteousnes
to his people: he trod the wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
alone, Isa. 63. 3. He looked
for an helper, &amp; there was none.
2. The application of it in the
meanes: and thus he takes in hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that is, the ministery of the
Word &amp; Sacraments, whose la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
he vseth in the worke of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation:
and in this second
consideration he takes <hi>Iohn</hi> in

speakes in the plurall number.</p>
               <p>Our Sauiour seeth <hi>Iohn</hi> in an

by the spirit of meeknesse, Gal.
6. 1. for 1. hereby we testifie our
hatred of the euill, which wee
seeke to suppresse. 2. It is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of true Christian loue to
helpe our brethren out of sinne,
whereas to let them runne on in
error, not seeking to reclaime
them, or restraine them, is a part
of hatred and crueltie. Leuit. 19.
17. Thou shalt not hate thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:2377:38"/>
nor suffer sinne vpon him:
as wee would not suffer our

harmes. 3. It is the right vse
and dispensing of our gifts, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we lay them out to the profit of
our brethren.</p>
               <p>2. Christ leads <hi>Iohn</hi> into his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
dutie most gently, which was to
looke to his calling, and not
pretend modestie, or reuerence
to hinder him in the same. This
was <hi>Peters</hi> error, Ioh. 13. 8. hee
would not in modestie haue
Christ wash his feete, till Christ
tolde him that then hee must
haue no part in him. Oh then
(said <hi>Peter</hi>) not my feete onely,
but my head and hands and all.
God had called <hi>Abraham</hi> to
kill his sonne: he must not now
pretend nature or pitie, or the
promise, &amp;c. to hinder him;
Gods will and calling must bee
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:2377:39"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his square: Teaching 1. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to haue respect more to
their calling, than to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of any mans person: for 1.
God sends them equally to all.
2. In the ministrie all are one. In
the kingdome of God there is
no difference: herein <hi>Moses</hi> fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
Exod. 3. 11. saying, Who am
I, that I should goe to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
&amp;c? his calling should haue bin
in his eye, not <hi>Pharaohs</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Again it teacheth, that
whatsoeuer God commandeth,
no respect of man must hinder
vs from it. Gal. 1. 16. When God
called <hi>Paul</hi> to reueale his Sonne
among the Gentiles, immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he communicated not with
flesh and bloud: So in our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
we may not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune with

religion for holding or not hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it, we may not eye man or
the lawes of man, or goe by the
perswasioe of man, but tread all
that vnder our feet, as the three
Children and all the Martyrs
haue done. 4. In our common <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
courses of administring iustice
and equitie we must not respect
persons, fauour or disfauour, but
what Gods word and a good
conscience informed thence tels
vs is our dutie, especially if a
man haue taken an oath to a
corporation so to doe.</p>
               <p>3. Our Sauiour in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
of his speech with <hi>Iohn</hi> leads
vs into our dutie, namely,<note place="margin">Meeknesse necessary in infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and reforming</note> when
we are to deale with persons of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending

informing and reforming them:
wherein,</p>
               <p>1. Wee frame our selues to

Restore such as are falne, <hi>by the

25. <hi>Instructing with meeknesse</hi> the
contrary-minded, waiting if at

of the snare of the diuell.</p>
               <p>2. We tread in the steps of
our Sauiour Christ, of whom it
was prophecied, that he should
not crie, nor cause his voyce to
be heard in the streets; a bruised
reed he should not breake, Isai.
42. 2. &amp; 53. 7. When he was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
and afflicted, he opened
not his mouth. How meekely
answered hee him, that smote
him vniustly, Iohn 18. 23. If I
haue euill spoken, beare witnesse
of the euil? and how meekly did
he call <hi>Iudas</hi> friend, comming to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:2377:40"/>
apprehend and betray him?</p>
               <p>3. Wee manifest a notable
fruit of the spirit, called the <hi>Spirit
of meeknesse,</hi> &amp; hath in it the pith
of loue, which when it acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
a reproofe, it is that oyle,
euen the precious oyle which
breaks not the head, Psal. 141. 5.</p>
               <p>4. We take the course to doe
good by reproofe; whereas to
reprooue with rancor and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
seeking rather to disgrace,
than to reforme the party, hath
no promise, no good effect, Pro.
15. 1. <hi>A soft answere puts away
wrath,</hi> but grieuous words stirre
vp anger: and 25. 15. <hi>A soft
tongue breaketh the bones:</hi> and
Rom. 12. 20. A <hi>meeke</hi> and gentle
behauiour heapes coles on the
enemies head. See the example
of <hi>Gideon</hi> appeasing the men of
Ephraim, Iudg. 8. 1, 2, 3. and
<hi>Abigail Dauid,</hi> 1. Sam. 25.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2377:41"/>
But if <hi>Iohn</hi> had sinned of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
or wilfulnesse, Christ
would haue been plainer and
rougher with him, as Matth. 23.
hee denounced many woes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Scribes and Pharisies.
For this is a rule of all reproofes,
They must bee so tempered, as
that the party reproued may be
brought to a true sight of his
sinne, and to be pricked in hart,
if it bee possible: God himselfe
doth so reproue, as he sets mens
sinnes in order before them,
Psalm. 50. 21. If a man will still
winke and shut his eyes, or goe
on in contempt of God and his
ordinances, hee must bee dealt
plainly withall: a cold and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functory
reproofe, such as <hi>Eli</hi>
vsed, will doe no good; yet in
this plaine reproofe there must
bee such carriage, as the party
may see himselfe rather repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2377:41"/>
by God, than by vs: See
2. Cor. 13. 2.</p>
               <p>Againe, in that Christ affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note>
that he was to fulfil all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
learne, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> required
to perfect righteousnesse,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 17.</note> that
Christ fufilled in most absolute

the Law, but to <hi>fulfill it.</hi>
Rom. 10. 4. Christ is <hi>the end of
the Law,</hi> for righteousnesse to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

               <p>How did Christ fulfill y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Law?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He fulfilled,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> 1. the <hi>ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi>
Law by his one oblation of
himselfe vpon the Crosse: for
then all of it had his end; then
the vale was rent. 2. The <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi>
two waies: First, in his owne
person; <hi>partly</hi> by his doctrine, in
deliuering the perfect doctrine
of the Law, and clearing it from
corruption: <hi>partly</hi> by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:2377:42"/>
both <hi>actiue,</hi> performing
the whole, and euery duty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the loue of God, or our
neighbour; and also <hi>passiue,</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
the curse due to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression;
and <hi>partly</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of his nature with the
Law, which onely hee (since the
fall) hath, or can haue. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
in the persons of others he fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the morall Law:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Of the <hi>godly,</hi> 1. by <hi>imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
Rom. 5. 19. By the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of one, many are made iust:
and this is by giuing faith to the
Elect. 2. By <hi>inchoation,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation
of their nature by the
Spirit, writing the Law in their
hearts, Ier. 31. 33. and making
them to walke in his waies, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zech.
36. 27. But this fulfilling is
weake, and onely begun in this
life, wherein the best (in their
minds) serue the Law of God,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:2377:42"/>
but in their flesh, the Law of sin,
Rom. 7. 22.</p>
               <p>2. Of the <hi>wicked,</hi> by execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
the curse vpon them, and so
they fulfill it in the condition of
it, because they doe not in their
conformity yeeld vnto it.</p>
               <p>But by what bond was Christ
tyed to fulfill the righteousnesse<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
of the Law?</p>
               <p>Galath. 4.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> 4. When the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of time was come, God
sent his Sonne made of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and made vnder the Law:
<hi>made of a woman:</hi> that is, not
begotten; and <hi>made vnder the
Law,</hi> not borne vnder the Law.
For Christ was, and is, the Lord
of the Law, as the Sonne of
man is the Lord of the Sabbath,
and by his nature (as Lord of
the Law) is not subiected vnto
it, but by meere and voluntary
condition of will, abased him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:2377:43"/>
and subiected himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it; and not as a priuate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but as a pledge and surety,
and that in our stead represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the persons of all the Elect:
Thus saith the Apostle,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 7.</note> he <hi>made</hi>
himselfe of no reputation, and
was <hi>made sin</hi> for vs, and a curse,
&amp;c. All which shewes, that it
was a voluntary subiection, and
a free-will offering of himselfe;
for else could it not haue been
acceptable.</p>
               <p>Neither may any man stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at that common obiection,
wherby they would make Christ
merit for himselfe, and all this
fulfilling of righteousnesse to be
necessary for himselfe; because
his flesh and man-hood was a
creature, and ought homage to
God as Creator. I answere, The
man-hood of Christ is conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
two wayes: 1. as seuered
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2377:43"/>
from the Deity, and in it selfe;
and thus it owes all obedience
to God: but 2. as from the very
first conception, it was receiued
into the vnity of the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and became a part thereof;
and thus it hath an eternall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
from the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and is exempted from the
common condition and obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all other men, and freed
from the common bond of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.
Thus our comfort is
euery way enlarged, in that
Christ did all for vs; not by any
such necessity of nature as wee,
but by free choyce and election
of will, by which his whole o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
was a free-will offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Heereby Christ is concluded
to bee perfect God:<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> for hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a naked man, that can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
fulfill all righteousnesse;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2377:44"/>
and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> not for himselfe directly,
but for all the Elect: he is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
iust, but a iustifier, Isa. 53. 11.
by his knowledge. Who could
obserue all the precepts of the
Law? Who could vndertake
vpon himselfe, and foile and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome
all the curses of the
Law, due to the sinnes of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect?
Who could merit all the
promises of the Law, that they
should be yea and Amen to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers;
but this second <hi>Adam,</hi>
our <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> God with vs, and
in our nature, as well as in our
stead? Ier. 23. 6. The name wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they shall call him, is, <hi>The
Lord our righteousnesse:</hi> and 35.
16. He that shall call her, is <hi>The
Lord our righteousnesse.</hi> And hee
that can thus iustifie beleeuers,
is God; because hee can both
merit, and impute a perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,
and by renewing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:2377:44"/>
their nature, and donation of
the Spirit, begin, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish
the same in themselues.</p>
               <p>Secondly, obserue the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
perfection,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> perpetuity, and
strength of the Law, seeing
Christ must come from heauen
to fulfill it; not a iot of the Law
shall passe away, when heauen
and earth passe away. How lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
doe men thinke heereof, that
let passe the precepts, promises,
and threats, as if they were
things not at all concerning
them? Whereas, if a man could
ouerthrow heauen and earth, he
could not diminish one tittle
of the Law. The wickedest
wretch that liues, and sets his
face against heauen, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
in his defiance of the Law,
shall fulfill it in the curse and
plagues of it; as hee that will
transgresse the Lawes of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:2377:45"/>
King by felony, shall fulfill the
law in the penalty of death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> if Christ haue fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
all righteousnesse, and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Gods iustice, then haue wee
found comfort: 1. Our whole
debt is paid, hee hath payed the
vttermost farthing for euery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer:
here is a stay to him that
sees his insufficiencie &amp; banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
estate. 2. If Satan set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the beleeuer, and come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him for the breach of the law,
which God will stand so strict
for, here is a full answere, Christ
<hi>hath fulfilled all righteousnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Vse 4.</note> heere is a Cannon
and battry: 1. Against all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
merit, and humane righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
and satisfaction; it must
be Christs righteousnesse that
must be meritorious and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie;
his, who can fulfill all
righteousnesse, which we cannot
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:2377:45"/>
doe, neither neede to doe after
him. 2. Against all workes of
hypocrites and vnregenerate
ones, who being without faith in
Christ, all they doe is sinne, no
fulfilling of righteousnesse. 3. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
loose Christians, who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Christ hath fulfilled all,
will doe nothing: for, to whom
Christ fulfilleth all righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for iustification, he renueth
their hearts, and giueth them
his Spirit, that they shall ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
to fulfill the Law; not to
satisfie for, or to iustifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
but to testifie their thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
for such a free and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
grace.</p>
               <p>Further,<note place="margin">Doct. 3. Christians must aime at vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> as Christ our Lord
had respect to fulfill euery duty
that God had commanded him

to do all the things that

God hath enioyned him by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his calling, generall or
particular. Deut. 5. 29. Oh that
there were such an hart in them,
to feare me, &amp; <hi>keepe all my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements!</hi>
and ver. 32, 33. You shal

Phi. 4. 8. <hi>Whatsoeuer things are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,</hi>
iust, true, of good report,
thinke on these things, and doe
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. The whole Word of God
calls for it:<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> the Law, whereof
euery iot must be fulfilled, and
the fragments of it gathered vp,
curseth euery one that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not in <hi>all</hi> things; and the
Gospell teacheth to obserue <hi>all</hi>
things, Math. 28. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. The worke of grace dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the heart and soule equally
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:2377:46"/>
to one good thing as well as to
another: the sound grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
changeth the whole
man, and reneweth the whole
nature with all the powers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
And indeede heere lyeth a
maine difference betweene a

one will seeme to doe many
things with <hi>Saul,</hi> but <hi>Agag</hi> shall

and hateth <hi>all</hi> the wayes
of falshood. Giue thy selfe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in some things, and in the
end thou wilt take liberty in all.</p>
               <p>3. The eye of the Lord is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
euery man, to watch him
how farre hee is wanting in any
good work, which he hath giuen
him calling &amp; meanes vnto, and
as he is ready to commend the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2377:47"/>
presence of any true grace, to
encourage it: so taketh he notice
of that which is wanting, partly
to reprooue the want, and partly
to prouoke vs to the purchase of
it. Thus he testifieth of many of
the Kings of Iudah, who were
highly commended in some
things, but failed in others; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the high places were not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away wholy, or some league
was made with Gods enemies,
or some forgetfulnesse ouertook
them: So the Spirit in the new
Testament, writing to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,<note place="margin">Reu. 2. &amp; 3. Chap.</note>
speaketh plainely, I know
thy workes, &amp;c. but this I haue
against thee, This thou hast, and
this thou hast not.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. As it yeelds thee comfort
of soundnesse here, so it aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
and furthereth thy recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and prepareth a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
account for hereafter. How
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:2377:47"/>
rich might a man be in good
workes? what an Haruest might
hee make account of? what a
crowne of righteousnesse might
he expect, that were carefull in
this endeuour to looke to doe
one duty as well as another?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. This was the commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of sound Christians in time
past: <hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
walked in <hi>all</hi> the ordinances of
God without reproofe; first, they
framed their liues to all Gods
commandements, and then they
are said to keep them, or to walk
in them. 1. Because Christs kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of them was imputed to
them. 2. Because themselues
were renued by the Spirit to
keepe all, not legally in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
act, but euangelically in the
endeuour to keepe them, and
griefe in failing. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth
and commendeth the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2377:48"/>
Romanes, chap. 15. 4. that they
were <hi>full of goodnesse;</hi> and <hi>Dorcas,</hi>
Act. 9. 36. that she was <hi>full of good

               </p>
               <p>Wee must therefore account
the whole word of God our rule
of life,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> as well as the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
and so respect
greater duties in the first place,
as we neglect not the least: for,
is not euery word of God a bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of conscience to obedience
or to punishment? No man can
be an imitator of Christ herein,
that is not diligent to know the
whole will of God in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and conscionable to subiect
himselfe as well to one precept
as to another: the Word bids
thee, Thou shalt not kill, steale,
commit adultery; the same word
bindes thee to all particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of mercy, of iustice, of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety;
the same Word bindes
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:2377:48"/>
thy eyes from vnlawfull lookes,
thy tongue from guilefull or
corrupt speech; yea thy thoughts
are not free, but ought to bee
kept in full conformity with the
will of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> this serues to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue
lame and cripple Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
hauing at most, but one
leg to walke vpon, and that very
impotent. Some content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with opinion of religion,
and hope they walke with God,
in publike and priuate duties,
which care they are to be set for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in; but in dealing with
men iustly, discreetly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionably,
heere they faile: they
separate those things which God
hath ioyned. Others, so they
walke ciuilly and honestly, so as
man cannot reprooue them, are
safe enough; the care of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is wholly cast off, as if the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:2377:49"/>
of religion and ciuility were
at warres, and could not both
lodge in one house, or heart. But
this lesson binds on thee a care
of all duties, both as a man, and
as a Christian. The Magistrate
must be both a good Magistrate,
and a good man: if hee admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
iustice, and neglect religion,
he may bee a tolerable Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
but a vile man: if he shall
thinke that he is onely a patron
of equity, and not set out as a
pattern of piety, and a fore-man
in all good exercises, hee hath
not yet learned to tread in the
steppes of godly Magistrates,
whose chiefe care was to leade
others the way to the Temple:
If he shall thinke, that the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Church, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing
of sinne, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of the godly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
onely to the Minister, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:2377:49"/>
he will haue no hand in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse;
we may with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
conclude him to be neither
a good Magistrate, nor a good
man. The Minister must not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be a good Preacher and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
but a good man, mercifull,
sober, watchfull, heauenly-min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
humble: for, hee that teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
another, should not hee
teach himselfe? And as his gifts
are aboue ordinary mens, so his
care must bee in them all, to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
himselfe both a good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister,
and a good man. Priuate
men, who professe the teaching
of grace,<note place="margin">Tit. 2. 12.</note> must learne to liue so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
iustly, and godly in this
present world.</p>
               <p>It were infinite to shew the
particular duties in their seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
rankes, all which must haue
place in Christian life: onely
consider, that there is no man,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:2377:50"/>
which is not bound, 1. to all
duties of religion and godly life.
2. To all duties concerning
outward righteousnesse, which
all men claime. 3. To all spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
duties charged vpon him
by vertue of that society, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
hee is a member, whether
Church, Common-wealth, or
family. And for the better per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of them all, obserue
these rules:</p>
               <p>1. Make conscience of this
duty, as knowing that omission
of duties, and failing in them,
shall receiue sentence against
them, as well as commissions:
Depart from mee,<note place="margin">Mat 25. 42</note> for yee haue
not done these and these
things.</p>
               <p>2. Looke what thou art cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
vnto; and in thy calling, what
is most needfull and necessary,
and that doe; wisely preferring
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:2377:50"/>
the generall calling, before the
speciall, and heauenly things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
earthly: as for other mens
matters, meddle not vncalled;
and for things lawfull, if not so
necessary, bee not so conuersant
in them.</p>
               <p>3. Keepe thy selfe in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to euery good worke, both
in respect of thy selfe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
Know that thou hast al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
one iron in the fire, a soule
to saue,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 10.</note> an <hi>Election to make sure,</hi>
which requireth <hi>all diligence:</hi>
and now is thy day, thy tide, thy
tearme-time; thou maist not
slacke thy opportunity: And
for thy brethren, if thou canst
doe them good to day in soule
or body, delay not till to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
Say not vnto thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
Goe, and come againe,
and to morrow I will giue, when
thou hast it by thee, Prou. 3. 28.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:2377:51"/>
This may be the last day of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thy selfe, or others good, and
therefore accept it.</p>
               <p>4. Hee that would fulfill all,
must not onely take occasions
offered, but euen seeke them,
and watch them, as being glad
to obtaine them. So did the
Patriarkes, they watched at their
gates, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they might shew
mercy, and ran a farre off to
force them to accept it: so
should the sonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi>
seeke out to relieue Christ in his
members, those that are truly
poore indeed: heere is a note of
a cheerfull Christian, when loue
and mercy flow from him, and
are not forced.</p>
               <p>5. So contriue thy course
and businesse, that neither du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of piety hinder the duty of
thy calling, nor these stand in
the others way. God is a God
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:2377:51"/>
of order, and hath not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
one duty to destroy and eate
vp another, but to feed and
strengthen one another. Eccl. 8.
5. The heart of the wise knowes
time and iudgement; knowes
how to subordinate duties, and
not make them opposite: the
heart of the wise will forecast
for the Sabbath afore-hand, and
so order the weekes businesse, as
the Lords Sabbath bee not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croched
vpon. The heart of the
wise will so husband opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and manage the affaires of
his calling, that the priuate ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of God in the family shall
not be interrupted: as prayer,
reading, &amp;c. which is often o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
through want of proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
which would haue allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
time for it, which some do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall
distraction hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured.
The heart of the wise
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2377:52"/>
will order times and seasons, as
there shall bee place for euery
good worke in the weeke day,
and especially for the best
workes; as if there bee a publike
exercise of religion, it were hard
if a good heart could not gaine
one houre in the weeke-day to
watch with Christ; if it were
any thing else, which went with
the streame of corruption, as to
any gaming, sporting, or some
vnwonted occasion, twice as
much time would either bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed,
or insensibly lost. Doc
as you doe in your trades, in this
trade of godlinesse: many seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
businesses belong to euery
trade, yet a wise man so casts
them, as one crosseth not, but
helpeth forward another.</p>
               <p>6. See that no time passe thee,
of which thou canst not make a
good account: hast thou so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2377:52"/>
things to doe, and lettest
precious time slip and doe none
of them? 1. Pet. 1. 17. Passe the
whole time of your dwelling
heere in feare, and, Redeeme the
time, because the dayes are euill.
There is no time, wherein God
and thy neighbour, or thy selfe,
the Church or Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth,
or thy family, or the Saints a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
call not for some dutie
from thee; and canst thou stand
idle in the vineyard, hauing so
much worke before thee? Hast
thou all righteousnesse to fulfill
in endeuour? and canst thou
finde an idle time to intend no
whit at all? Oh lay vp these rules,
and they will be excellent helpes
to set thee forward after Christ,
till in the way that himselfe hath
appointed, thou commest vnto
him to receiue the fruit of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</p>

of it. <hi>Iob</hi> was so desirous to see

31. 13. And seeing his error,
chap. 39. 38. He professed thus
of himselfe: Once <hi>haue I spoken,

twice, but I will proceed no further.</hi>
The like we see in <hi>Dauid,</hi> when

Sam. 25. 32. Blessed be the Lord
that sent thee, and blessed bee
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:2377:54"/>
thy counsell, and blessed bee
thou that hast kept mee from
bloud. Thus did the Israelites at

concerning the spoiles and
captiues, 2. Chron. 28. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">Reason 1</note> This is a signe of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. It is a note of the loue of

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Continuance in a knowne

and when men see and wil
not see, God giues them vp to
hardnes of heart, Isa. 6. 9, 10. and
to strong delusion, 2. Thess. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. The Lord noteth it for the
way of the foole,<note place="margin">Pro. 26. 16.</note> to bee wise in
his owne eyes, and that there is
more hope of a foole then of him
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2377:54"/>
that will leane to his owne

               <p>First then,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> in hearing the
Word, bring teachable hearts,
which is the way to profit in
Gods wisedome: for, hee teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the humble in his way, Psal.
25. 9. and the wise in heart will
receiue commandements, Prou.
10. 8. and he that heareth coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
is wise. Consider how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerously
<hi>Moses</hi> replied vpon
God againe and againe, till the
Lord was very angry: and so did
<hi>Peter</hi> once and againe, Ioh. 13.
6, 8. till Christ told him in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest,
that if he washed him not,
he should haue no part in him.
Therefore let all flesh stoope to
the wisedome of GOD in his
Word.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> this conuinceth
the obstinacie of men, who hold
it a poynt of wit and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2377:55"/>
to defend euery nouell opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
they take vp, and not yeeld
an inch to any man what euer
bee brought to the contrary.
And indeed if a man bee resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
to hold and maintaine an
error, hee will be hardly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come:
for the diuell and his own
wicked heart will suggest words
and colour; as for substance and
soundnesse they care not, the
contention is for victory, not for
truth: but all this is the way of
one wise in his owne eyes: a
proud folly, an ignorant lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
leading into strength of
delusion. This folly is now set
on horsebacke, as the numbers
of strange questions (not in cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
or circumstance) but in
the substance of religion, daily
forged out of conceited braines,
doe witnesse: and it is the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happinesse
of many a man; that
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:2377:55"/>
he cannot rise into request, but
by the fall or foyling of some

               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> priuate persons espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

of the heauens: secondly,
the desce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the holy Ghost
in a visible shape vpon him:
thirdly, his Fathers voyce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him.</p>
               <p>But first it is said, that Christ,
so soone as hee was baptized,
came straight out of the water,
and this not without iust rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
for 1. whereas <hi>Iohn</hi> in his
baptisme of others preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:2377:56"/>
them, and admonished them
to looke to their faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
and before they came
out of the water, instructed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in the doctrine of Baptisme, and
exhorted to bring forth fruites
worthy repentance, vers. 8. so as
they were stayed awhile (as it
seemeth) after their baptisme,
Christ presently asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded; where
<hi>Iohns</hi> wisedome is commended
in putting difference betweene
the person of Christ and others:
he knew, that though Christ
must be baptized with his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
yet he needed not his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction:
and teacheth Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
wisely to see into the estate
of their people, that they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
duties to them according
to their seuerall necessities.</p>
               <p>2. It sheweth the willingnes
of Christ to vndertake his office;
he staied no longer than he must
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:2377:57"/>
needs: and indeed all his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
was most voluntarie,
teaching vs also to make haste,
&amp; not delay in doing the worke
which God hath committed to
vs. Psal. 119. 60. and ver. 32. I will
runne the way of thy comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
when thou shalt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
my heart: we loue quicke
seruants, and so doth God.</p>
               <p>3. Christ stayed not in the
water, but hasted to receiue the
Spirit promised in his baptism,
and teacheth vs not to stay in
outward washings, but hasten
our selues to the Spirit, without
which, all externall washings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
nothing: it is meet to vse
the outward meanes as Christ
did, but not to stay in them: for,
further than the Spirit accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
them, they are but dead
and powerlesse.</p>
               <p>4. This speedie comming
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:2377:57"/>
out of the water, was a type of
his rising from vnder our sinne,
which his baptisme washed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and of ours in him. Againe,
the Euangelist <hi>Luke</hi> hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
circumstance, chap. 3. 21.
That Christ as he was baptized,
did pray. It is vndoubted,<note place="margin">Why Christ prayed at his bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</note> that
Christ both before, and in the
time of baptisme, did lift vp his
heart in requests vnto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
but now the Euangelist
recordeth, that so soone as hee
was baptized, hee composeth
himselfe vpon the banke of Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,
to solemne and humble
prayer, both in respect of that
which he had done, and that hee
was further to doe.</p>
               <p>For the first, he was now bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and in regard of that hee
prayed, and teacheth vs, 1. in
that hee first was baptized, and
then prayed, that wee must be
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:2377:58"/>
first cleansed and sanctified, and
then pray: men must lift pure
hands with pure hearts in euery
place, God will not heare sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
hands full of blood, and an
heart full of hypocrisie, make
prayer abominable: therefore
wash you and make you cleane,
and then come, and we will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
together, saith the Lord,
Isa. 1. 16. 2. In receiuing the
Sacrament, a holy heart knowes
that hee hath to doe with God,
and lifteth it selfe aboue sensible
elements; it labours to approue
it selfe to God, and lookes not
at men, but at God and his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and renewes it selfe with
faith, repentance, &amp; inuocation.
3. In that Christ goeth to God
for a blessing vpon the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
receiued, we learne that all
the grace, holinesse, and efficacie
of any Sacrament is to be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:2377:58"/>
continued and encreased
by the meanes of prayer.</p>
               <p>For the second, Christ pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
in respect of that hee was to
doe.</p>
               <p>1. Hee was now to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
that great Prophet of his
Church, Deut. 18. 18. And the
whole ministry of the new testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was now to be deliuered
and consecrated in him, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
vndertaking this great
worke, he goeth to his Father for
blessing and successe in it.</p>
               <p>2. He was now in a solemne
manner by sundry testimonies
from heauen, to be set apart for
the worke of Redemption, and
the saluation of man being lost,
a ministry which men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
were all too weake for: and
no maruaile if he pray to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for sufficient strength and
grace to vndergoe the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:2377:59"/>
3. He knew that the heauens
were to be opened, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he will be in prayer, to shew
the power of prayer, that it pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
the heauens, and entreth the
presence of God, and preuaileth
for blessing.</p>
               <p>4. The Spirit was to descend
vpon him, and therefore hee
would be in prayer, to teach vs,
that the prayers of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are of that force, that they
bring downe the holy Ghost
with all graces vpon earth; as
else-where it is said,<note place="margin">Luk. 11. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> If you that
are euill, can giue your children
good things, how much more
will your heauenly. Father giue
the holy Ghost to them that ask
him?</p>
               <p>5. God the Father was to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
of him as hee neuer did of
any: Christ would be apart at
prayer, not only that the people
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2377:59"/>
should not mistake the person,
on whom the Spirit descended,
and the voice was vttered, but
also that wee might note, that
faithfull prayer doth cause God
to giue some euident testimony
or other vpon those, with whom
hee is well-pleased: for prayer
from time to time hath procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Gods louing fauour to his
children, and the fruites of it in
all necessary blessings, spirituall
and temporall.</p>
               <p>Now, in that Christ here vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh
his office, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
with prayer, we learne,
that</p>
               <p>Whatsoeuer we take in hand,<note place="margin">Doct.</note>
wee must reuerently and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
vndertake it with prayer,
but especially two things aboue
other: 1. The parts of Gods
holy worship. 2. The duties of
our callings: in both which our
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2377:60"/>
Lord goeth here before vs in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.
Shall Christ doe this,
and haue not we more need?</p>
               <p>First, the parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1.<note place="margin">Parts of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to be entred with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> We are to come into
the glorious presence of God,
who is of pure eyes, and cannot
behold wickednes, Habak. 1. 13.
but requires holinesse and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in the worshippers of him:
for, what hast thou to doe with
my law and ordinances, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
to be reformed? he will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
himselfe in all that come
neere him; and therefore wee
ought not to come without
leaue, reuerence, preparation,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and prayer. 2. If wee consider
the vanity and profanenesse of
our nature, the wandring of our
hearts, and thereby our vnfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and disability in Gods ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,
we shall plainly see, that we
haue neede to looke to our feet,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2377:60"/>
and to get grace by prayer, that
we may be pleasing in his sight.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">So are the seuerall duties of our special callings.</note> the duties of our
callings. Col. 3. 17. <hi>Whatsoeuer yee
shall doe in word or deede, doe all in
the name of the Lord Iesus, giuing
thankes to God:</hi> a generall rule
for all the actions of thy calling,
yea, of thy life, and for all the
words of thy mouth, is this: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with Christ, and end with
him, that it may be to his glory.
This prayer hath two parts:
1. Petition before, whereby espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the beginning of the
day, &amp; the work of it, a Christian
craues Gods assistance, blessing,
&amp; acceptance. 2. Thankesgiuing
at the end of the day, &amp; of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
for his calling, for the free
vse of it, and Gods blessing in the
successe: Both are necessary;</p>
               <p>1. Because euery creature of
God,<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> and euery ordinance, is
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:2377:61"/>
sanctified by the word &amp; prayer,
1. Tim. 4. 4. the <hi>word</hi> sheweth
the lawfulnesse of the duty to be
done, and directeth vs in the
right manner, meanes, and ends
in performance: <hi>Prayer</hi> serueth
to obtaine blessing and successe;
for nothing can further be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
vnto vs, then we receiue the
blessing thereof from GOD;
and wee can looke for no bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
which wee pray not for.
Consider well, and you shall see
all Gods promises runne with
this condition: Whatsoeuer we
would haue God to doe vnto vs,
our Sauiour tels vs we must aske
it in his name; <hi>Whatsoeuer yee
shall aske in my name,</hi> it shall be
done vnto you: Whatsoeuer we
would haue God to giue vs, wee
must not expect it out of the
same condition,<note place="margin">Math. 7. 7.</note> Aske and it
shall be giuen you. Psal. 50. 15.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2377:61"/>
Call vpon me: there is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement:
and I will heare
thee: there is the promise.</p>
               <p>2. Such is our weakenesse, as
when we doe any thing the best
we can, we had need to pray to
doe it better, and for pardon
that we haue done it no better:
which if it bee true in externall
things and duties, wherein we
are better acquainted, much
more in spirituall, wherein our
ability is much lesse.</p>
               <p>3. We neuer receiue so much
fauour from God, but we still
stand in need to craue more, nor
neuer so little, but that we haue
much to be thankefull for.</p>
               <p>This doctrine serues to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note>
such as content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
with the worke of Gods
worship, that come to the word
and Sacraments, but beg not a
blessing of God before-hand,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:2377:62"/>
whereas Christ himself conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not himselfe with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
meanes, but prayed for a
blessing: And this is the very
cause why men find so litle taste,
strength, and power in these or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
because Gods blessing
goes not with the meanes; and
therefore it is sundred from his
own ordinances, because it is not
asked. Is it any maruell, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> come carelesly, carnally, and
profanely, without reuerence &amp;
religion to the exercises of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that they goe away as bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishly
as they come, and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
they thus profane Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things, the more senslesse and
incurable they grow by them,
more hardned and hopelesse?
What good hath many a man
gotten by customable comming
to the Word and Sacraments
many yeeres together? for their
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:2377:62"/>
knowledge, babes may pose
them in principles; for their
conscience, we may as soone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile
with children of three
yeeres old, to sit reuerently and
attentiuely, as some of three or
foure score, who in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
are so sleepy, as it were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were at home in their
beds, or take order to bring
their beds with them; and for
their profitablenesse in their
places, or reformation of any
thing in publike, or in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
families or their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
God nor man can see no
such thing. Now would I aske
these men as old as they be, how
often they can remember they
haue humbled themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, that he would blesse
the Word vnto them, and them
to vnderstand it, and make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of it, to reforme their
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2377:63"/>
wayes, to comfort their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.
Alas dead men! this is a
strange motion to them, and
now wee conclude, No bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
asked, none obtained, but a
curse accompanied them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to harden them: whereas
humble &amp; feeling prayer would
haue opened the heauens, and
fetched downe the Spirit to
haue accompanied the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
and so some testimony
would haue bin seene, that God
had been better pleased with
them and their worke.</p>
               <p>They may likewise see their
errour and reforme it,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
the ordinary duties of
their calling, without calling
vpon God for a blessing; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it is prayer whereby all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
things are obtained, both
publike and priuate, for our
selues and for others, belonging
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2377:63"/>
to this life, and the life to come;
and the neglect hereof is the
cause why many men thriue not,
but rise early, goe late to bed,
and eate the bread of careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
either in vaine, or else get
money and put it in a broken
bagge: and all is, because
they humble not themselues
morning &amp; euening with their
family, for a blessing on their
labours, and neuer pray but
coldly, and for custome, and that
in the Church onely. If some
mans conscience now tell him,
that although hee hath neuer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
this course of prayer with
his family, and yet hee thriues,
and prospers, and his worke go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
well enough forward: to
him, I say, 1. That he holdeth
nothing that he hath, by any
speciall fauour of God, but by
the generall prouidence where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2377:64"/>
he feeds the bruit creatures;
and all this while God hath no
more respect of him than of
them. 2. He holds nothing by
vertue of any promise, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Christ: for whatsoeuer
God hath promised, he applieth
it in this meanes of prayer, and
not otherwise. 3. Wealth and
prosperity beeing not had, or
held by vertue of any promise
of God, nor yet in the meanes
of God, is so farre from being a
blessing vnto him, that the curse
of God abides him and it; hee
by it corrupts himselfe, hardens
his heart, withdrawes it from
God, drownes it in the things of
this life, and is to be drawne to
a reckoning for his vniust vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let this example of
Christ,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> vndertaking all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with prayer, somtime pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2377:64"/>
sometime priuately; yea
his whole Passion, as in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
often and feruently, mooue
vs to accustome our selues to
this duty: for,</p>
               <p>1. Heerein lies a difference
betweene the child of God,<note place="margin">Motiues to feruent prayer.</note> and
a worldling, betweene a sound
Christian, and an hollow hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite:
the one <hi>walketh with God,</hi>
lifting vp his heart to God in
holy meditations and prayers
continually, as iust occasion is
offered; and therefore by this
title the Scripture describeth
true Christians, Act. 2. 41. And
<hi>Paul</hi> saluteth all the faithfull that
call vpon the name of the Lord,
1. Cor. 1. 2. The other are noted,
Psal. 14. 4. by this marke, They
call not vpon God. Prayer is as
the breath, whereby wee know
whether a man liue the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
life or no: a child that cries
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2377:65"/>
not, is dead and still-borne, as
we say; no prayer, no breath of
the Spirit, &amp; no breath, no life.</p>
               <p>2. Our owne benefit calleth
for this duty; all good comes
vnto vs by reason of the great
power of prayer, which auaileth
to set heauen open, to bring
down the Spirit, to pacific God,
and appease him being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
We see what great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
things the Saints
haue obtained by prayer; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Elias, &amp;c.</hi> And lest we should
thinke that these examples ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaine
not to vs weake and
silly men, the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
this as an argument to
force vs to prayer, by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of <hi>Eliah,</hi> who prayed that
it might not raine,<note place="margin">Iam. 5. 17.</note> and it rained
not in three yeeres, &amp;c. Not
that we should pray so, that it
may not raine for so many yeres
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2377:65"/>
together; but, if the power of
prayer bee so preuailing with
God, that therefore wee should
be much and often in this duty:
and surely he that can pray well,
can want no good thing, needs
feare none euill.</p>
               <p>3. It is a notable fence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sinne: for, as the more sin
preuailes, the lesse can a man
pray; so, the more he prayes, the
lesse is he ouertaken with sinne.
When the true man is assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
if he cry for helpe, the theefe
runnes away; and so doth sinne,
(a theefe which euer doggeth
and besetteth vs to rob vs, and
steale away grace) if we can cry
mightily to God.</p>
               <p>4. Acquaint thy selfe with
God; for the times come when
nothing will stand by thee but
his helpe; and therefore vse
prayer, to be familiarly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2377:66"/>
with him: know him now
in the time of thy prayer, that
he may know thee in the day of
thy distresse.</p>

               <p>NOw it followeth, that wee
speake of those three admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
euents, which followed the
Prayer<note place="margin">The open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heauens vpon him in his prayer.</note> of Christ: 1. The sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
opening of the heauens.
2. The visible descending of
the holy Ghost. 3. The audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
voice of God the Father,
witnessing to many, both eye
and eare-witnesses, the solemne
instalment and induction of
Christ into his office and worke
of mediation and ministery:
Wherein wee must know, that
as there neuer was in all the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2377:66"/>
world so high and excellent an
office as Christs was: (for, the
greatest of Kings, and the high
Priest, who yet were with great
state and obseruation anoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and deputed to their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
were but shadowes of this:)
euen so God would haue Christ
entred into it with such magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
and glory as neuer man
was, nor creature is capable of.
As the Coronation of a Prince,
with what glory, pompe, and
sumptuousnesse, euen to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
is hee brought foorth
with his Nobles and subiects?
But all this is but earthly glory,
from earthly men, to an earthly
King: But now at the Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Prince of peace, God
sets himselfe from heauen to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
it; and for this purpose he
doth more familiarly, and yet
more gloriously reueale him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:2377:67"/>
vnto all mankind, then he
had euer before done from the
creation of the world; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
was any ceremony in all the
world so honoured, as this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of Christ was. The ancient
sacrifices of Gods institution
were honoured by manifest
signes of his gracious presence,
as by the fire which came from
heauen continually to consume
them: the Arke was honoured
with speciall signes of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
presence, sitting betweene
the Cherubims, answering by
Oracle and voice, vnto cases
propounded: the Temple it
selfe at Ierusalem, at <hi>Salomons</hi>
prayer and dedication, was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the glory of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
in that cloud that filled
the House of the Lord, 1. Kin. 8.
10. and this cloud still watched
ouer the Tabernacle, Exod. 40.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:2377:67"/>
34. But these were all but sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
to this, wherein the Lord
did not cloud and vaile his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
or reueale his presence in
some signe, but the Diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty
manifested it selfe distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as we may say, in person, yea
in the distinction of all the three
Persons, the <hi>Father</hi> testifying his
delight in his deare Sonne, the
<hi>Sonne</hi> standing in Iordan, and
receiuing his Fathers testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
and the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in the visible shape of a
Doue.</p>
               <p>From whence is notably
grounded the doctrine of the
blessed Trinity of persons,<note place="margin">Obser.</note> in the
Vnity of diuine essence, because
they be so really distinguished,
although they cannot bee sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
               <p>But the word Trinity,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> is not
to be found in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:2377:68"/>
Yet the doctrine is,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> if not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the letter, yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the sense. Mat. 17. 5. In
the transfiguration of Christ,
the Sonne standeth, the Father
by his voice witnesseth, and
the holy Ghost ouershadowes
him in a cloud, as heere by a
Doue. So Matth. 28. 19. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
them in the name (not
names, to note the vnity) of the
Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost.
And 2. Cor. 13. 14. The grace of
our Lord Iesus Christ, and the
loue of God, and the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the holy Ghost bee with
you all. Besides, there is expresly
the word <hi>three,</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
comes, 1. Ioh. 5. 7. There be
three that beare witnesse in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
the Father, the Word, and
the holy Ghost, and these <hi>three</hi>
are one. So also Gal. 4. 6. <hi>God</hi>
sent the <hi>Spirit</hi> of his <hi>Sonne</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2377:68"/>
your hearts.</p>
               <p>Which is worthy to be by the
way obserued,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> as against sundry
other damnable Heretikes, so
especially against the Iewes at
this day, who hold an indistinct
essence in the Deity, without
distinction of persons: and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
against the wicked Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
who deny the Sonne of
God to bee begotten of the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of the Father, and to bee
coeternall and coequall with
him; they hold him to be meere
man, onely borne without sin,
and receiuing the Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
measure; and in all those
places, where he is called God,
they vnderstand it God by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
not by nature, as the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
is called God; and by this
equiuocation they can deceiue
the Magistrate, and professe
(namely in this their sense) that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2377:69"/>
they verily beleeue him to bee
God, and yet meere man. But
this place, and many other as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
him into equall digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with the Father and holie
Ghost, as wee shall further see
in the Fathers testimonie of
him.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>opening of the heauens</hi>
consider 1. how they were ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
2. why they were opened.
For the former; not the whole
heauens, but a part, and that part
ouer the earth where Christ
prayed in the banke of Iordan,
and not to all the people of the
earth, but to those onely that
were present with Christ, were
the heauens opened: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is said, The heauen was
opened vnto him, not (as some
say) to <hi>Iohn,</hi> but to Christ: for so
the phrase is vsed, Act. 2. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<hi>visae eis linguae, i. su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:2377:69"/>
eos.</hi> The difficultie is in the
manner.</p>
               <p>Some think it was but an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition
in the aire,<note place="margin">How the heauens were ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> because the
densitie of the heauens (as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie
teacheth) cannot admit
of any diuision in the same. But
this is vnlikely: for in appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
the eye is easily deceiued by
thinnesse or thicknesse, neerenes
or remotenes, light or darknesse
of the parts of the heauens and
clouds: now God would not
haue so notable a confirmation
of Christs calling stand vpon the
credit of a thing so liable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
as apparitions be. Againe,
this was a miracle, by which
Christs office was exalted, and
therefore goes beyond nature,
and it is absurd to limit so tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent
a power within the
rules and hedge of nature.</p>
               <p>Others of the Fathers, whom
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:2377:70"/>
some Schoolemen follow, think
that there was no alteration in
the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the bodily eye, but
it was a meer vision, which none
but Christ saw, and that not
with the eyes of his body, but of
his minde, such a vision as <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi>
and <hi>Steuen</hi> saw. But this is
not so: for first, to the eyes of
Christs minde heauen was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
shut. Secondly, Mark. 1. 10.
hee saw the heauens <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
a word vsed in things real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done, and vsed of the rent gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Luk. 5. 36. and of the vaile
of the Temple, which was rent
in twaine. Thirdly, the other
signes were really and sensibly
done, the Spirits descending vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
and the Fathers voyce au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
and sensible, which are
things of greater difficultie to
conceiue as wee shall see: and,
visible and sensible were they
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:2377:70"/>
not so much for Christs, as for
<hi>Iohns</hi> and the peoples confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that stood there.</p>
               <p>It seemeth therefore to bee
true, that the heauen was sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
diuided and rent in twaine,
euen as the earth was when <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>
and his company were swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
vp. This is not vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
to conceiue, if wee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the Lord might well
doe as much for his Sonne, as he
had formerly done for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.
<hi>Henoch,</hi> in his body as wel
as in his soule, was taken vp into
heauen: here either the heauens
must diuide themselues, or one
body must pearce and penetrate
another, which euen glorified
bodies cannot doe. <hi>Eliah,</hi> when
<hi>Elisha</hi> prayed him that his spirit
might be doubled on him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
thus, Thou askest an hard
thing, yet if thou see me when I
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:2377:71"/>
am taken from thee, thou shalt
haue it so, 2. King. 2. 11, 12. and
<hi>Elisha</hi> saw him when he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vp into heauen by a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde,
and consequently saw the
heauens diuided to receiue his
body now glorified in the act of
translation.</p>
               <p>When Christ had accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
his whole ministery, Act. 1.
9. while his Disciples beheld, he
was taken vp into heauen; they
did see the heauens opening
themselues to receiue his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
body: and shall we think
it absurd, that according to the
letter of the Scripture, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should enter him into that
ministery by a sensible opening
of the heauens? As easie it must
bee for God to doe this, as to
make the Sunne stand still, the
Sea runne backe, yea the Sea to
diuide it selfe and stand like a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:2377:71"/>
wall for the defence of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
And, that he thus did, it is
plaine, because this serueth for
the greater confirmation, and
glorie of the businesse in hand,
which aboue all other the Lord
set himselfe to aduance &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to the world.</p>
               <p>Now in the second place,<note place="margin">Why were the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s opened.</note> the
reasons why the heauens were
opened, were sundry.</p>
               <p>1. To manifest the truth and
certaintie of the other signes
which followed, that seeing the
heauens opened, they might not
conceiue, that either the Doue
or the voyce came from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place.</p>
               <p>2. To shew that howsoeuer
Christ stood there as a weake
man, and in similitude of sinfull
flesh, yet he was the Lord from
heauen heauenly, of whom was
verified, Ioh. 3. 31. Hee that is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:2377:72"/>
come from heauen, is aboue
all.</p>
               <p>3. That as his person, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
his doctrine was diuine and
heauenly, ver. 34. He whom God
hath sent, speaketh the words of
God: and this was the speciall
worke of his doctorall office, to
reueale the will of his Father.
And Io. 1. 18. No man hath seen
God at any time, the onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Sonne, which is in the
bosome of the Father, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
him. The power also and
grace, whereby he wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
was not from Beel-zebub,
but from heauen.</p>
               <p>4. To shew that his office,
into which he was now entred,
was and is to open heauen again
for vs, who by sinne had shut it
against our selues; he hath made
our way vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> throne of grace.
And thus this second <hi>Adam</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:2377:72"/>
standeth in opposition with the
first; he shut vs out of Paradise:
a token that we were shut out of
heauen: but this lets vs into the
Paradise of God againe.</p>
               <p>The heauens are opened by<note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
his passion, not by his baptisme,
Heb. 10. 19.</p>
               <p>They are opened by his death<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
as by a common cause, which
must be specially and singularly
applied, and that is by baptisme:
therefore it is said, Rom. 6. 3, 4.
We are baptized into his death;
that is, to haue benefit by his
death.</p>
               <p>1. Note hence, that Christ
by fulfilling all righteousnesse,
hath set heauen open vnto vs,
and consequently, the iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a sinner, is not onely by
the obedience of his passion, but
also by his actiue obedience in
fulfilling the Law: for, 1. the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2377:73"/>
whole summe of the Law, is, to
loue God with all the heart, &amp;c.
which if we performe not in our
selues, or in Christ, then the
whole Law is abolished, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
euery iot must be accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
Math. 5. and Christ came
not to destroy the Law, but to
fulfill it. 2. The sanction of the
Law (Cursed is euery one that
abideth not in all things) cannot
be auoided, if all those things be
not done in our selues or our
surety. 3. There are two parts
of iustification: 1. Remission of
sinne, which is by the blood of
Christ, which takes away all sin.
2. Imputation of Christs righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse:
neither can the one
stand without the other, as 1.
Cor. 5. 21. Hee hath made Him
sinne that knew no sinne, that we
should be made the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of God in Him. And this
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:2377:73"/>
meetes with their maine obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that when sin is taken away,<note place="margin">Christ hath fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led actiue righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for vs as well as passiue.</note>
the Law is fulfilled, and the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
acquitted and iustified: for
that is not true; for a sinner is
not iustified when sinne is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,
vnlesse iustice be added.
Sinne must be couered indeed,
but that is but fulfilling of halfe
righteousnesse, vnlesse righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
be imputed, Rom. 4. 25.
He was deliuered for our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and was raised againe for
our iustification: where iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is farre more then remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sinnes. 4. The words of
Scripture are plaine, Rom. 5. 18.
By the obedience of Christ ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are made righteous: and 10.
4. Christ is the end of the Law
for righteousnesse; and not only
to remoue vnrighteousnesse. As
for all those places, wherein it is
said, that Christ hath purged all
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:2377:74"/>
sinne with his blood, &amp;c. they
are to be meant exclusiuely, in
respect of the blood of beasts or
any meritorious workes of men
out of Christ, but not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the meritorious actiue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of the Sonne of God.
5. Hee that is circumcised, is
bound to keepe the whole Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> That was to make him
a fit Sauiour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No, but <hi>that hee might
redeeme them</hi> that were subiect
to the Law, and that they might
receiue the adoption of sonnes,
vers. 5. Hee speakes plainely of
Christs actiue obedience. We
will conclude with <hi>Bernard, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
mihi datus, totus in meos vsus
expensus est.</hi> When I can haue
too much of Christ, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
his actiue obedience;
but if by fulfilling all righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
he hath opened heauen, I
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2377:74"/>
will lay fast hold vpon all his
righteousnesse to bring mee
thither.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hence wee note
what we are to thinke of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of Christ, who came from
heauen, and spake from heauen.
Heb. 1. 1. In these last dayes God
hath spoken to vs by his Sonne,
and therefore our meanes of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
are great and glorious;
the onely begotten Son, which
is in the bosome of his Father,
hath reuealed the Fathers will
vnto vs. Naturall light hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
much of God to many
men; supernaturall light hath
made him more manifest, both
by the deliuery of the Law, and
the promises of the Gospell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Christ to come, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Iewes saw God after a
sort through the vaile of types
and shadowes, but did not see
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:2377:75"/>
him clearely and perspicuously,
till Christ was manifested in the
flesh, who was in his person the
brightnes of his Fathers image,
and in his office the chiefe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
and Teacher of his Church.</p>
               <p>Whence it followes, Heb. 12.
25. That if they escaped not, who
refused him vvhich spake on
earth, much lesse shall we, if we
turne from him that speaketh
from heauen: and 2. 2. If the
vvord spoken by Angels was
stedfast, &amp;c. how shal we escape,
if wee neglect so great saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was first begun to be
preached by the Lord, and is
confirmed to vs by them that
heard him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> Oh, if we should heare<note place="margin">Heauen opened it selfe, to confirme our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to be from heauen.</note>
Christ speake from heauen, wee
would obey.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The doctrine that we
bring, is from heauen, heauen
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2377:75"/>
opened it selfe to giue confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to it, the same it is which
Christ taught, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
receiued from him, and we
from them; and of vs, holding
our selues to the Apostles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
our Sauiour saith, Hee
that heareth you, heareth mee.
With how great danger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doe men refuse and turne
away from our doctrine? how
shall they escape, that refuse do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
from heauen? A iust thing
it is, that they be giuen ouer to
Satanicall and hellish delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
who refuse doctrine from
heauen.</p>
               <p>3. This opening of heauen
being a signe of that which
Christ had done, affoordeth spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
comfort to all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ, in that heauen
being shut against vs by our sin
(for into it shall no vncleane
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:2377:76"/>
thing enter:) Christ hath set the
gate of it open vnto vs againe;
hee hath made a way, and as it
were a thorow-fare betweene
heauen and earth.</p>
               <p>By him (saith the Apostle) all
things in heauen and earth are
gathered into one, Ephes. 1. 10.
and Col. 1. 20. He hath reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to himselfe through him all
things, which are in earth and in
heauen; that is, all elect and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing
men on earth, and the
blessed Saints and Angels in
heauen: and this followes, that
in the former verse, where Christ
is called the head of all things;
being the head of his body, hee
hath made a passage both for
himselfe and his members.</p>
               <p>How doth Christ open hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
for vs? oh that we could see
such a sight!</p>
               <p>Christ openeth heauen: 1. by<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:2377:76"/>
the merit of his obedience vnto
the death; so saith S <hi>Paul,</hi> Col. 1.
20. By the bloud of his crosse he hath set at peace all things.<note place="margin">Christ o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth heauen for vs 3. wayes.</note> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
on his death. 2. By the
donation of his Spirit, who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
faith in the heart of Gods
child; which is as an hand wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Christ with all his benefits is
receiued, and a mouth whereby
he is eaten; so is it an eye clee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to see thorow the clouds
God sitting in his glory, vpon
the Propitiatorie and Mercy-seate,
and sometimes vpon the
throne of his iustice. Heb. 11. 27.
By faith <hi>Moses</hi> departed Egypt,
and feared not the fiercenesse of
the King, but endured as one
that sawe him that was inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
By faith <hi>Henoch</hi> walked
with God, hee had him euer in
his eye, heauen was euer open
and vndrawne vnto him. <hi>Iose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:2377:77"/>
saw on the throne of his iustice,
and said, Can I sinne and doe
this great wickednesse against
God? Thus the godly in this life
haue heauen after a sort opened,
so as they haue God euer present
with them. <hi>Steuen</hi> being full of
the holy Ghost, saw heauen o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen;
get faith, and thou shalt
see it open too. 3. By the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of his intercession, Ioh. 17.
Father, I will, that where I am,
they also be to behold my glory.
Now he was heard in all that he
prayed for, so as by vertue of the
merit of his intercession, all the
elect shall be gathered in soule
and body into heauen after this
life. This same key openeth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to our prayers, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>
               <p>Heere is the comfort of the
godly, that whereas the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
hath shut heauen on them,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:2377:77"/>
and set hell wide open, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
all the creatures against
them: this second <hi>Adam</hi> hath
opened heauen againe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
all things; there is now
passage from man to God, from
earth to heauen, by the prayer
of faith: and betweene God and
man, while hee heareth prayer
and bestowes heauenly blessings:
a passage for the Spirit, and for
Gods helping hand in trouble;
there is a beaten way betweene
heauen &amp; earth, in which Gods
Angels are continually mouing
as dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ministers to the heires
of saluation. Here ye may see <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi>
ladder, which reacheth
from earth to heauen, on which
the Angels are continually as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 1.</note>
and descending: this
ladder is Christ himselfe, who
by his humanity toucheth earth,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 51.</note>
and by his diuinity reacheth vp
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:2377:78"/>
to the heauens, and so hath made
heauen &amp; earth meete together.</p>
               <p>And as this comforteth vs
through our whole life, so espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in the houre of our death
it is of exceeding vse; then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
is he that can see the heauens
opened by Christ for him, as
<hi>Steuen</hi> did; he shall lay himselfe
downe in rest and assurance, that
though his body shall be inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the earth for a time, yet
his soule shall ascend to God,
and both soule and body in the
Iudgement day shall partake of
the glory, vnto which Christ the
Head is already ascended; and
the same power, which made the
heauens themselues now at his
baptisme set themselues open to
strengthen &amp; encrease the grace
of his Saints, shall then set them
wide open to confirme them for
euer in glory.</p>

with the gifts of the holy

the God-head, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

gifts, by a Metonymie of

the third Person in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as 1. Ioh. 5. 6. and <hi>that Spirit is

               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> True it is, that this
descending of the Spirit, was a
locall motion from heauen,
where it was opened, vnto earth
to the very head of Christ, and
yet wee may not conceiue any
locall motion in God or any of
the persons: but in one word,
The signe or siymbol wherein
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:2377:80"/>
the holy Ghost pleased to testify
a speciall presence or efficacy,
doth take the name of the thing
signifiyed; the Doue, a signe of
the Spirit is called by the thing
signified, the Spirit it selfe; not
that the blessed Spirit was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
into a Doue or any simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
(whose nature were it not
immutable, he could not bee
God:) but because it pleased
him, retaining his owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable
nature, to appeare
vnder this forme and likenes:
and thus <hi>Iohn</hi> also, seeing this
shape and appearance descend
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen, is said <hi>to see the Spirit</hi>
which is inuisible; the Doue sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying,
called y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spirit, signified
by a figuratiue kinde of speech,
common in the Scriptures. The
Ark was called <hi>The Glory of God,</hi>
because it was a speciall signe of
it.<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 3.</note> Three Angels came to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:2377:80"/>
one of them, seeming to be
more glorious then the other,
is called by the name Iehoua;
a name proper to God, and not
agreeable to any Angel, further
then he representeth the Sonne
of God as that did.</p>
               <p>The right interpretation and
vnderstanding of such phrases,
would cut off infinite quarrels
about the reall presence, which
is onely held vp, because by this
same figure the bread signifying
is called the body signifyed;
which if it necessarily imply a
change of the bread into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Body of Christ, then because
the Spirit of God is called a
Doue, hee must necessarily bee
turned into a Doue, &amp; of a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
God become a creature;
which is high blasphemy.</p>
               <p>3. The manner or forme of
the Spirits descending, was in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2377:81"/>
the shape of a Doue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether was this a
true materiall Doue, or an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of a Doue only?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It is enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the presence of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost vnder the forme of a
Doue, and it is no article of
faith whether it was or no: But
yet I thinke it was a true reall
body and corporal Doue; 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>Luke</hi> addeth (in a bodily
shape) implying that there was
a body. 2. Because none of the
other signes were imaginary or
appearances, but reall things:
whence some of the Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that it was as true a Doue,
as the Spirit was a true Spirit.</p>

which when it was accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,

it was with those bodies in

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is not to
be referred to the Doue, but to
the Spirit, who manifested his
presence in this likenesse. 2. The
phrase doth not alwayes note
likenesse and similitude onely,
but verity and identity, as Ioh.
1. 14. Wee saw his glory, <hi>as</hi> the
glory of the only Sonne of God;
and Phil. 2. 7. Christ was in the
shape of man, and like man: shal
we thence conclude, that he was
not a true man, but one in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:2377:82"/>
onely?</p>
               <p>Why did the holy Ghost ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
in this shape? For some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
hee appeared in mighty
winds, as to the Apostles; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in burning fire, wherein
he seemes to be contrary to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p>These diuers symbols and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
of the presence of the
Spirit, argue diuers, but not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
effects; all of them his
wisedome made choyce of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the occasion and
present vse. There was great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene the ministery
of Christ, and <hi>Moses;</hi> betweene
the Law, and the Gospell, and
accordingly the Spirit manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
himselfe. The Law was
confirmed with terrour &amp; feare;
but to ratifie the Gospel, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
appeares in the shape of a
Doue. Act. 2. 2. Hee is noted to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:2377:82"/>
come like a mighty rushing
winde, to shew the mighty po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of the Gospell in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of the Apostles, who were
now to bee sent out: so in the
shape of tongues, to shew the
vtterance giuen by the Spirit to
the Apostles: in the shape of
clouen tongues, to note the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of tongues and languages,
wherewith they were indued:
in the shape of fiery tongues, to
shew the fruit and efficacie of
their ministery and doctrine,
which should bee as fire to seuer
betweene drosse and pure me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.
So heere the Spirit would
appeare in the shape of a Doue,<note place="margin">Why the Spirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a Doue.</note>
to note, 1. what kind of Spirit
Christs was: 2. what kind of gifts
they were, which were collated
and bestowed vpon him: and
3. what was the fruit of those
gifts.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:2377:83"/>
For the first, in the Doue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
two things: 1. Of all fowles
it is the most mild, without gall.
2. It is most innocent and harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
not rauening and hurtfull.
Which signifieth, that Christ
should be indued with a mild,
meeke, and gentle spirit: so it
was prophesied of him, Isa. 42. 2.
That he should not cry nor lift
vp his voice in the streets, a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
reed hee should not breake;
and how it was accomplished,
the whole story of the Gospell
witnesseth, Math. 12. 19. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
that he should be most inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
blamelesse, of a most pure
spirit: In him was no guile, no
deceit in his lips. Who could
accuse him of sin, being the spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
Lambe of God?</p>
               <p>2. As the Doue hath many
excellent properties; patience,
simplicity, sincerity, tendernesse
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:2377:83"/>
to her young, faithfulnes to her
mate, &amp;c. Euen so God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath fitted Christ with all
profitable and necessary gifts;
humility and patience, holinesse
and integrity, loue and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
constancy and diligence
in working out the good of his
members.</p>
               <p>3. The fruit of these gifts is
the appeasing of his Fathers dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
conceiued against the
sinne of man: for looke as the
Doue which <hi>Noah</hi> sent forth out
of the Arke, returning with an
Oliue branch, which argued the
ceasing of the deluge, brought
newes that Gods wrath was now
asswaged and decreased with
the waters: so the Spirit of the
Lord is vpon Christ in the form
of a Doue, sending him out to
preach the acceptable yeere of
the Lord, and good tidings of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:2377:84"/>
liberty to captiues, &amp; the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the prison to them that
are bound, forgiuenesse of sin,
and conferring of grace, &amp; life,
&amp;c. Isa. 61. 1. Now this being
the end of the Spirits appearing
in this shape, separating and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Christ to his ministery, &amp;
that onely for this time, and not
reserued out of this time and
vse, it is not now lawfull for any
man to represent the holy Ghost
by this shape, or make an image
thereof: for this is to make an
Idoll, as the Papists doe, not
onely in this, but in painting
God the Father like an old man,
because he is called the Ancient
of dayes, Dan. 7. 22. Both of
them flat Idolatry. God is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
his Law, if he make shapes,
Cherubs, or bodies, it is iust be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee doth it: but wee are
borne vnder the Law, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2377:84"/>
forbids the making or
hauing of any Image of God in
any vse, or any at all in religious
vse, and enioynes vs to worship
God in spirit and truth, onely in
the Image of his Sonne.</p>
               <p>And it will strongly follow,
that if wee may not reserue the
shapes which God himselfe hath
vsed to manifest his presence,
much lesse vpon any colour, any
Images or Idols deuised and
beautified by Idolaters, abused
in times past, and in present,
and for time to come, subiect to
be abused to the maintenance
of Idolatry. Heere come all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
pictures to bee defaced,
whose Idolatry is as grosse as
euer the Heathens was: a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
thing, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> any Christian

               </p>
               <p>The 4. point is the Spirits
descending vpon Christ, for
these reasons: 1. To shew that
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Christ was set apart to his great
work, not onely by the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of man, but by the holy
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Ghost. 2. That hee was now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with gifts fit for such a
worke: for this was the vnction
or anoynting of Christ to bee
the King, Priest, and Prophet of
his Church, as Isa. 61. 1. <hi>The
Spirit of the Lord is vpon mee, hee
hath anoynted mee</hi> to preach.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But Christ was filled
with the holy Ghost from his
infancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer.</hi> He was endued with
such a measure of the Spirit, as
was fit for his priuate estate; yet
now entring vpon a publique
office, and a worke after a sort
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:2377:85"/>
infinite, he needeth more grace,
and receiueth according as his
calling required.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But then Christ had
imperfection in him, if hee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
some grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It implies a degree,
but not imperfection: hee was
perfectly graced so farre, as his
youth and priuate estate requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
yea, as much as that was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of; it being with him as
with the Saints in heauen, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
whom are degrees of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
but not want nor imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And 3. to shew that the Spirit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
did perpetually rest with Christ,
therefore Ioh. 1. 32. the Spirit
<hi>abode</hi> vpon him. This was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied,
Isa. 11. 2. The Spirit of
the Lord <hi>shall rest vpon</hi> him, the
Spirit of counsel and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
of wisedome and strength,
the Spirit of knowledge, and the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2377:86"/>
feare of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But the Spirit of God
dwels in the Elect, therefore this
was no priuiledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Neuer did or can the spirit
rest with Saint or Angel, as hee
did with Christ. 1. In respect of
his humanity, the Spirit is euer
with that, working in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> nature
all diuine vertues, graces, &amp; glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
both in nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber &amp; degree per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
as fitting the Head; wheras
the members haue some, not all,
and in some small degree, not in
all perfection of degrees, as hee
was, being anointed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> oyle
of gladnes aboue al his fellowes.
2. In respect of his Deity, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
the third person, is perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
present with the Son, as ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnto him in the admirable
vnity of one &amp; the same nature;
yea, so ioyned, as he proceedeth
from the Son as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Father,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:2377:86"/>
and hath his subsistence from the
Son, as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Father, by the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication of one
and the selfe-same nature. In
which respects, the Spirit neuer
lighted, nor did rest with any but
with Iesus Christ alone. 4. Some
adde a fourth reason of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
lighting on Christ: not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to designe Christ, but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
him by an apparent
signe from <hi>Iohn,</hi> lest any should
thinke that the voyce following,
<hi>This is my well-beloued Sonne,</hi> was
vttered of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and not of Christ
himselfe.</p>
               <p>The fifth point is, Why it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/>
said that <hi>Iohn</hi> saw all this: this
was, 1. that the Word of the
Lord might be accomplished,
who had promised <hi>Iohn,</hi> that he
should certainely know Christ
by this signe, Ioh. 1. 33. 2. That
<hi>Iohn</hi> might beare record of the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2377:87"/>
trueth heereof, not onely in his
age, but to all succeeding ages:
so it is said, Ioh. 1. 32. <hi>Iohn</hi> bare
record, saying, I saw the Spirit,
&amp;c. Hence was it, that it did so
openly appeare, because it was
not onely for Christ, who as hee
was man, and had taken vpon
him our infirmities, had need of
assistance, but for <hi>Iohn</hi> also, and
the people of God: see Iohn
12. 30.</p>
               <p>1. Note, that the Spirit of
God is no quality or created
motion in the minde of man:
for then hee should not exist
without the mindes of men, (for
the accident cannot be without
the subiect, to which it clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth:)
and much lesse could the
Spirit appeare in a visible and
distinct forme, as he did heere,
and in the feast of Pentecost.
2. Hee is here a distinct person
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:2377:87"/>
from the Father and the Sonne,
and yet ioyned with the Father
and the Sonne. 3. He is called
God. Act. 5. 3, 4. To lye to the
holy Ghost, is to lye vnto God:
and 1. Cor. 12. 11. Hee giueth
gifts to euery one according to
his will, as heere hee anointeth
Christ the head, &amp; consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
is the Author of all good gifts
with the Father of lights, and
not the gifts themselues.</p>
               <p>2. Note, as Christ was set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
both by the ministry of
man, and by the Spirit, by the
visible appearance of which,
God would manifest, that hee
was fitted thereunto: so in all
those that are set apart by man
to the ministry, must be an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant
descending of the Spirit,
though not in visible shape, yet
in euident gifts and graces. The
reason is sound: if Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:2377:88"/>
must not take this honour
vpon himself, but the spirit of the
Lord must be vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him to preach,
much more must it be so with
those that come in his name.
Adde hereunto these arguments:</p>
               <p>1. If God, when hee had set
down the frame &amp; parcels of the
materiall Tabernacle, did set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
a <hi>Bezaleel,</hi> and fill him with
the Spirit of God, in wisedome
&amp; vnderstanding, in knowledge
and all curious workmanship,
and ioyned an <hi>Aholiah</hi> vnto him,
into whom he put wisedome, to
make al after his draught, Exod.
31. 3, 6. And, if when <hi>Salomon</hi> is
to build the material Temple, he
must haue his <hi>Hiram</hi> sent for, a
man full of wisedom, vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and knowledge to work all
manner of worke in brasse, 1.
King. 7. 14. much more the true
<hi>Salomon,</hi> in building his spiritual
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2377:88"/>
Temple, makes choice of men
filled with the spirit, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. If the Prophets &amp; Apostles
performed euery thing by vertue
of their extraordinary calling by
God, then must Pastors &amp; Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
also, by vertue of their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
calling by God: They
spake &amp; wrote, as they were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
by the holy Ghost, 2. Pet. 1.
<hi>vlt.</hi> they reuealed and fore-told
things by the Spirit, 1. Pet. 1. 10,
11. The Spirit of Christ in the
Prophets, searched and signified
the time, and passion, &amp; glory of
Christ: the Spirit was promised
to teach the Apostles what to
speake, and to leade them in all
trueth, Ioh. 14. Yea, the Spirit
shall teach you in that houre,
Luk. 12. so must we be furnished
by the Spirit to our duties. 1.
Cor. 17. 7. The manifestation of
the Spirit is giuen to euery one
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2377:89"/>
to profit withall, to one a word
of wisedome, to another a word
of knowledge. Whence the
Spirit is said to send Pastors,
Act. 20. 28. Pastors at Ephesus
were made ouer-seers by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost; because he fitteth them
to the Church, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them by gracing them to
the vse of it.</p>
               <p>3. This sitting of the Spirit,
giueth a mans selfe much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:
1. That hee is lawfully cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
of God, who sendeth not his
message by the hand of a foole,
(for this is as he that cutteth off
the feet:) but he sendeth a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
tongue, an <hi>Ezra,</hi> an <hi>Apollos,</hi>
mighty in the Scriptures. This
was signified by the consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes, who
must be, 1. washed, purged from
whatsoeuer might blemish their
calling. 2. Arrayed with new
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:2377:89"/>
garments, signifying their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
and instructing with
graces, of wisedom, knowledge,
&amp;c. 3. Perfumed with a sweet
smell of the holy oyle, noting the
sweetnesse, the sweet sauour by
holy doctrine and life, which
they were to diffuse into the
Church. This when it was done,
then were they set apart by the
Lord, and not before, Leu. 8. 3.
2. That God, who hath graced
him, will protect him, and carrie
him thorow the troubles of his
calling, which Satan and the
wicked of the world (whom hee
is to encounter with) will raise
against him: which promise of
speciall protection, while the
sonnes of <hi>Sceua</hi> wanted, Satan
(who easily spied their want of
commission) mightily preuailed
against them, Act. 19.</p>
               <p>3. That God will blesse his
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2377:90"/>
labour, and the workes of his
calling, and make it powerfull
and fruitfull, because it is his
owne worke; whereas such as
haue not their commission sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from the Lord, finde not
their sacrifices burnt by God,
but often labour all day and
night, and catch nothing.</p>
               <p>A caueat not to runne vpon<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note>
mans calling without Gods, as
the false apostles did, against
whom the Apostles opposed
themselues: see that the chiefe
Bishop of soules send thee, that
he hath laid his hands vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee,
that hee hath bid thee receiue
the holy Ghost; as for the order
and ordination of the Church,
it is onely a manifestation and
declaration of him, whom God
hath fitted. Let euery Minister
be able to say as Christ himselfe
did, Isa. 48. 16. The Lord God
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2377:90"/>
himselfe, and his spirit hath sent
me, namely, to declare what <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
in his time was to performe
to the Church.</p>
               <p>And here he that would haue
good and assured comfort of his
commission, must examine what
kinde of gifts they be which he
hath receiued of the Spirit: for
they be of two sorts: 1. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to good and bad, as those
of knowledge, tongues, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
eloquence, to which
if working of miracles (if a man
haue no more) were added,
while he might much benefit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
himselfe might remaine a
reprobate. For, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi>
had the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>2. Proper and peculiar to
the elect, as iustifying faith, true
loue, inuocation, repentance,
vnspeakable groanes, and mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Doue, innocencie,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2377:91"/>
meeknesse, sinceritie, and such
like testimonies, that God hath
sent the Spirit of his Sonne into
the heart, purifying it, making it
cry Abba Father. These are gifts
worth hauing, making all the
former not onely profitable to
others, but truly comfortable to
himself, and acceptable to God.
Now shall a man speake power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
feelingly, and consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and resemble those holie
men of God, who wrote the
Scriptures, in interpreting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;
they shall speake and do as they
are moued by the holy Ghost;
men shall perceiue, and after a
sort see a fiery tongue vpon their
heads; such shall be the efficacie
and power of their ministerie in
separating the precious from
the vile.</p>
               <p>3. Note, wheresoeuer the
Spirit descendeth on any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2377:91"/>
it descendeth like a Doue,
that is, maketh a Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
the Doue. Whence it is,
that the holy Church or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of beleeuers is called by
Christ, his Doue, Cant. 2. 14.
1. Because the same sweet oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(as that of <hi>Aaron</hi>) runnes
downe from the head to all the
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers: the same graces, which
this Spirit in the shape of a
Doue did fill Christ withall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
measure, hee doth also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
in measure vpon Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
Thus are we said to receiue
of his fulnesse. A fountaine
sends the same water into the
streames that it self hath. 2. The
Spirit of God is euery-where
like to himself, both in the head
and members, as the same iuyce
is in the roote and branches, in
the tree and fruites: looke what
were the fruites of the Spirit in
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2377:92"/>
Christ, the same also are in the
members, Gal. 5. 23.</p>
               <p>To examine whether we haue<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
receiued this Spirit or no, by the
properties of a Doue.<note place="margin">Foure properties of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Doues of Christ.</note> 1. Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
is an essentiall mark of one

fierce or reuengefull thought.
2. In word, being reuiled, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiled

hee was led as a sheepe to the
slaughter, and was dumbe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the shearer, 1. Pet. 2. 23.
<hi>Moses</hi> was the meekest man on
earth, but not like him. If any be
a rough <hi>Esau,</hi> of a froward and
peruerse disposition, the Spirit
of Christ hath not sate and ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vpon him: for, in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Christ, the lyon and the

vs therefore put on, and decke
our selues with meeknesse, Col.
3. 12. A most beautifull grace,
much set by of God. How glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
a sight was it, and how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
to God his Father (as
the voyce witnesseth) when the
Doue sate vpon Christ? and
euen so the Apostle commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
this grace to women, as a
most precious garment to set
them out to God, and make him
set by them, as their most costly
garments doe set them out to
men: neither is it a garment
proper to the women, as distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
the sexe (which the
cloathing of our bodies doe or
ought to doe:) but the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between a naturall and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
man, an old and new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
for this makes difference
before God, when none is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:2377:93"/>
male and female. And
though we take little notice of a
meeke-hearted Christian, yet
God doth so account of it, as he
doth denominate the righteous
by it, and maketh it a speciall ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of the iust, Zeph. 2. 3. Seeke
the Lord, <hi>ye meeke of</hi> the earth: as
though none were fit to seeke
him, and he would be found of
none else.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> A second qualitie of those, on
whom the Spirit is lighted like
a Doue, is simplicitie, innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
commended to vs also by
Christ, Be wise as serpents, but
<hi>innocent as Doues;</hi> enforcing it
plainly to be a qualitie of those
who are baptized with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Christ: To which purpose
he knitteth these two together,
Cant. 5. 12. and 6. 8. My <hi>Doue,
my vndefiled.</hi> Elsewhere he calls
the Church faire as the Sunne,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:2377:93"/>
pure as the Moone, the Lords
holy ones, vndefiled in their
wayes, Saints, pure; not only in
regard of their iustification by
the bloud of Christ clensing
them from all sinne, but also of
their endeuour in sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>These Doues of the Lords
Culuer-house are cleane fowles,
not of the vncleane birds, Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
Crowes, and Hawkes that
can smell a carrion a farre off, to
flye to it, and feede vpon it: the
Spirit neuer tooke such a shape.
Let vs be carefull of our wayes,
not to foule our selues with sin,
which is the most filthy vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes:
but rather when the Spirit
sate vpon Christs head, make
knowne that it sate like a Doue
on our head, by purging our
selues, euen as he is pure, 1. Ioh.
3. 3. as it is a marke of our adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2377:94"/>
in that place. He is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of any grace, that ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth
not in this: wil the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God dwell in a stye? or
will hee powre his gracious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
into fustie and filthie ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels?
What may wee thinke the
hire of those that moyle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
in all filthie lusts, and
tumble like swine in their sinnes,
and in the meane time scorne at
those who desire to bee more
free and innocent from the riots
of the world; seeing GOD is
good to none but the pure of
heart, heareth none pray but
such as lift vp pure hands, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
no seruice but a cleane offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and from a cleane offerer,
admitteth none to the blessed
vision of God, but the pure of
heart, and much lesse to stand in
his Holy place, but hee that is
of innocent hands, and a pure
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:2377:94"/>
heart? Psalme 24. 3.</p>
               <p>What other spirit hath ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vpon them, then the spirit
that beareth rule in the world?
The spirit of lying, railing, swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
slandering, hath light vpon
their tongues: the spirit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
wrong, and wickednesse
vpon their heads: the spirit of
fornication, vncleannesse, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse
vpon all their parts
and members: and the spirit of
errour, delusion, &amp; desperate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency
hath settled vpon
their hearts: all this, because
they haue grieued this holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and made this Doue betake
himselfe to his wings, and left
them to bee haunted with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
spirit, as <hi>Saul</hi> was, when God
had forsaken him.</p>
               <p>A third quality of such on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
whom this Spirit of Christ hath
lighted, is chastity, sincerity
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2377:95"/>
and singlenesse in heart and life,
in body and soule: the Doue is
a most chast bird, truly keeping
her to her mate; and this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in all the members of the
Church, Cant. 4. 1. Thine eyes
are like the Doues, that is, single,
chast, beautifull. This eye of
faith beholds Christ and him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
acknowledging all perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of beauty and sufficiency
in him: it keepes the heart into
him alone in the purity of his
worship; it keepes the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
vnto him as the chiefe of
ten thousand: it watcheth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all vnchast lusts, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoneth
all vnlawful, strange,
and stolne pleasures, called in
1. Cor. 7. 34. The holines of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and spirit. Of <hi>spirit,</hi> when it
is not tempted to vncleannesse;
or being tempted, yeeldeth not;
or hauing yeelded, reneweth it
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:2377:95"/>
selfe to repentance. Of <hi>body,</hi>
when, as a fit instrument to a
chast soule, it neuer exciteth, nor
being excited, executeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse.
Whence it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that those that goe a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from God, as all Idolaters
that seek to many louers; or are
bawds to their owne lusts and
sinfull pleasures of any kind, or
prostitute their bodies to any
vncleannesse; or their members
as seruants of vnrighteousnesse,
are not possessed with the Spirit
of Christ. Idolatrous eyes, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
eyes, couetous eyes, euill
or enuious eyes, blind eyes, or
wanton eyes, are not the eyes of
Doues.</p>
               <p>A fourth quality in Isa. 60. 8.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
is this, They al fly to the Church
of God, and ioyne together in
his pure worship. Who are
these that <hi>fly like the Doues to the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:2377:96"/>
windowes?</hi> A prophesie of the
Gentiles conuerted, that shall
in such flockes come into the
Church, as if a whole flight of
Doues driuen by some Hawke
or tempest, should scoure to the
columbary, and rush into the
windowes. The Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to Gods culuer-house; thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Doues fly together, feed
together, roost together: which
signifies the Communion of
Saints, who are of one heart and
soule, and which worship God
purely with one shoulder: It is
no receptacle of Eagles and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenous
birds, which deuoure
one another: and the reason is,
because the Spirit lighting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Christians, tyes them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with fast bands of peace,
called The bond of the Spirit.
And hence it followeth, that
whosoeuer neglecteth the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:2377:96"/>
which is the chariot of
the Spirit, the Spirit lights not
vpon him: whosoeuer ioyneth
not in this society of Saints, and
carryeth not himselfe as one li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
with other the children of
God, vnder the same roofe of
one Father, he hath not the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God, and consequently is
none of his. What may wee
thinke of him that is an enemie
to the Church, that malignes
the members of it, that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the pure worship and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers,
that flies from the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-house,
but to be an vncleane
bird, no Doue?</p>
               <p>This is one speciall note of
the presence of the Spirit, which
I would not omit, because many
may come to see themselues bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

setting into his office, and
that from heauen also, as the
other were, and that by an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
voice: wherein are two
things;</p>
               <p>1. The circumstances, three:
1. Whose voice it was, The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
2. The place whence it
<hi>came, From heauen.</hi> 3. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
It was a sensible and audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
voice.</p>
               <p>II. The substance, in which
are three particulars: 1. That
Christ <hi>is the Sonne</hi> of God: to
note the relation between God
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:2377:97"/>
and Christ. 2. That hee is his
<hi>beloued Sonne;</hi> to note the neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of that relation. 3. The
fruit of it, <hi>in whom I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The Person whose voice
it was, is God the Father: for he
saith, <hi>Thou art my beloued Sonne.</hi>
Euery testimony receiues vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
and authority from the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stator,
therefore this must needs
be sound and good. God had
giuen testimony to Christ by
many famous men, euen all the
Prophets, and now lately by
<hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> who was greater
than a Prophet, that Christ was
greater than he; yea more, had
giuen testimony of him by a
multitude of heauenly Angels,
Luk. 1. 30. and 13. But not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with all this, he giues from
heauen his owne testimony of
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:2377:98"/>
1. To strike vs with reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence<note place="margin">Why God the Father giues te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to his Sonne 4. <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
                  </note>
in receiuing this testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
which hath this priuiledge
aboue other parts of Scriptures,
that it was vttered by Gods
owne mouth, not by men or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <p>2. To confirme vs in the truth
of the testimony, proceeding
from him who is <hi>prima veritas,</hi>
Truth it selfe (not onely true) in
his Essence, and much more in
his words and workes, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee deceiued, nor deceiue
vs.</p>
               <p>3. To shew the necessity of
beleeuing this testimony, being
the first and onely principle in
Christian Religion, without
which foundation laid, can bee
no religion, nor saluation, as we
see in the Iewes and Turkes:
That we might more firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
in the Sonne of God for
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:2377:98"/>
life, Gods owne mouth testifieth
so honourably of him. 4. That
such a glorious commendation
of this testimony might stir vp
our best attention and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in the vnfolding of it, wee
haue heere the word of a King,
which was neuer stained, and
that not vttered by any Herald,
or a Lord Chancellor, but from
his owne mouth, which carryeth
more waight with it: if God
speake, woe to him that heares
not.</p>
               <p>2. The place whence, <hi>from</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Christ was from heauen. 4. <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>heauen:</hi> for these reasons:</p>
               <p>1. For more authority to the
Person of Christ, whom God
from heauen doth honour: and
if God thus honour him, how
ought we to honour him? 2. Pet.
1. 17. Hee receiued of God the
Father honour and glory; when
there came such a voice to him
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:2377:99"/>
from the excellent glory, <hi>This is
my beloued Sonne:</hi> which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
not onely in the time of
his transfiguration, but here also.</p>
               <p>2. Because the testimony
containes the summe of the
whole Gospell, to declare that
the doctrine of the Gospell,
which Christ deliuered to the
world, was from heauen, because
God from heauen so testifieth it
to bee: wherein it differs from
the doctrine of the Law, which
although God renewed from
heauen in the Tables of stone,
yet was it written in the heart of
man by nature; so was not the
Gospell: but as after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fall it was
immediately deliuerd by God to
<hi>Adam</hi> in the promise: so here, by
the same voice from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
to be diuine &amp; heauenly.</p>
               <p>3. In respect of vs, that wee
should more carefully attend to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:2377:99"/>
the testimony it selfe, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the excellent glory,
and that from the mouth of the
God of glory, sitting in his
chaire of Estate, seeing the word
of a King in that place is more
regarded. The contempt of the
Law, giuen vpon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
in the hand of Angels, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
at their hands: how shall
they then escape, that despise
him that speaketh from heauen?
Hebr. 2. 2, 3. The Law being
transgressed, the Gospell from
heauen moderateth and pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
a man: but the Gospell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
heauen being despised, what can
pleade for him?</p>
               <p>4. To shew the extent of the
Gospell, that it is to bee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
and binds to the faith of it
all the people vnder heauen:
and herein it was not to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to the Law, which God
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:2377:100"/>
would haue acknowledged his
owne by vttering it from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
and that not before he had
sent <hi>Moses</hi> downe, lest it should
haue been thought to be his, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was so loud and pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
as it could not possible bee
but diuine, not humane.</p>
               <p>3. The manner of the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
by an audible and sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
voice: How the Father vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
this voice, is needlesse to
enquire, seeing we know, that he
who made the tongue, can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
speake without a tongue,
or by secret inspiration and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation,
as to <hi>Isaiah,</hi> 2. King. 20.
4. or frame a tongue and organs
of voice at his pleasure, to vtter
and make knowne his will and
good pleasure to his creatures:
or speake by creatures, as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
in humane shape, or other
creatures, sensible as <hi>Baalams</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:2377:100"/>
Asse; or insensible, as the bush
of fire. It is much more material
to enquire into the end and vse
of it, which was, to make the
Sonne of God knowne vnto the
world, that the faith of men
might be fixed on him for salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Hence note, in that the Lord<note place="margin">Obser. 1.</note>
from heauen teacheth by voice,
his wonderfull care, that will
not suffer vs to want any means
to helpe vs in the knowledge of
the meanes of saluation: he had
taught them and vs before, by
the sense of sight, seeing the
heauens opened, and the Spirit
visibly descending; and now hee
teacheth the eare by a voice: for,
he knowes our dulnesse, securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
slownesse of heart to beleeue,
and applies himselfe euery way
to helpe vs: hee setteth out his
glory by his workes and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2377:101"/>
he addeth his Word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by many powerfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles;
to his audible word he
hath annexed his visible word
the Sacraments; hee hath set vp
a constant ministery in his
Church, and euery way fitted
it to the edification of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
so as he may now say, What
could I doe more for thee, O
Israel?</p>
               <p>Is God thus carefull of our
profiting euery way?<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> then how
damnable and excuslesse shall
the carelesnes of the most bee in
the matter of their saluation? in
which regard it had beene good
for many a man, that God had
neuer made his will knowne to
him, that he neuer had heard
the word, or receiued the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
for, all tends but to his
deeper condemnation, because
of his neglect and formall vse.

but an opinion of the
Church, whether any pictures
of the Trinity be to be made:
And further, that those images
must not be multiplied, because
they giue occasion of blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
Besides, these pictures
are as senslesse as wicked: 1. To
picture the Father, as a man
with the whole world in his
hand, to note his creation and
prouidence (which the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists,
in Act. 17. 5. commend so
highly, as whence the people
may take much good:) is a
teacher of lyes, because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straines
creation and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Father. 2. To pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
the Father as an old man,
and the Sonne (who is as old as
he) like a child, is a lye, and not
footed, in the 7. of Daniel, where
the ancient of dayes is the whole
Deity. 3. To adde to these two
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:2377:105"/>
the image of a Doue for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, is (as it is said, Rom. 1.
23. 25.) to turne the whole glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God into a lye, and to
transforme most heathenishly
the glory of the immortall God,
into the similitude of a mortall
man, <hi>or feathered fowle.</hi> 4. If the
Diuinity can be pictured, then
may the three Persons: but hee
that will say he can conceiue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Trinity, or expresse the
Diuinity, hee is a lyar; much
lesse carue or paint any thing
like them.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> For the picture of Christ:
though I know sundry of the
learned are of another minde,
yet I thinke it neither can nor
may be pictured, and the reasons
to the contrary are none, or
weake: And I haue thought of
these grounds, which sway with
me till I heare or see stronger:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:2377:105"/>
1. Christs Diuinity cannot
be expressed in an image, and it
is dangerous in a picture to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
them which God neuer
disioyned: to diuide his natures,
sauoureth of the Nestorian he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie;
to offer to paint the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
of Christ, as they haue,
who to expresse it, haue made a
Rainebow, &amp;c. This is to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the heresie of <hi>Eutyches,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding
the natures, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribing
the Godhead; both
wayes it must be a lying image,
no way speaking trueth.</p>
               <p>2. Make an image of Christ,
as man, it is but of his bodily
shape; and as (D. <hi>Fulke</hi> saith) an
image of his bodily shape, is no
more his shape then another
mans: make such an image, and
what difference betweene his &amp;
the thiefes that was crucified
with him?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:2377:106"/>
3. The Scriptures, which
speake so much of his doctrine,
workes, and all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
speake not a word of any
lineament and portrayture of his
body, wherein Gods wisedome
preuented the true painting of
his body, which if any goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to doe, it must be a lying
image.</p>
               <p>4. Hee neede not be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

in euery Christian thou hast an
image of Christ: looke vpon him
and loue him, for the image hee
beares of Christ.</p>
               <p>5. Such a picture or image
cannot safely be made, in respect
of the dignity of the Person,
whose very humanity in <hi>composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:2377:106"/>

destroyed, and that wee should
haue nothing to doe with them;

               <p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. In respect of what it hath
beene: it hath beene an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and an obiect of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
a signe of God despised, a
conuicted instrument of Gods

that hath drawne the glory of

that man be thought chaste, that
cannot forbeare the picture and
iewels of an harlot? for a subiect
to keepe a monument of the
enemies conquest, argues a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous

               <p>2. In respect of what images
are, mens deuices, not named

in despight and detestation of

teachers of lyes, <hi>dung</hi> to God,
and so called, such things as
ought not to be named among
Christians. Now if an idoll be
as dung to God, ought it not to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:2377:108"/>
be so to vs? If God haue pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, shall wee count them
cleane? and do we account them
dung, when we garnish our best
roomes with them?</p>
               <p>Againe, they be Idolothytes,
things sacrificed to deuils; and
no Corinthian, no Christian
may eate an Idolothyte, for any
ciuill vse or commodity: Say
not then, The creature is good,
and beautifull, and vtterly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the vse: this plea will not
preserue it by the Papists do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
it selfe: for thus the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists
(in Reu. 2. Sect. 8.) describe
an Idolothyte; Though the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be good by creation, it doth
become an Idolothyte, and is
made execrable by the prophane
blessings of heretiques and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.
Shall not wee yeeld as
much? nay, the image is no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God (though the matter
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:2377:109"/>
be) nor good, and therefore by
Popish doctrine it selfe, we may
not reserue it: for <hi>Aquinas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
saith, <hi>In rebus infructuosis</hi> we
may not communicate with
Gentiles, though in <hi>fructuosis</hi>
we may.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. In respect of what these
images may be: they are snares,
and may be the occasions of
grosse idolatry to posterity: it is
as a iewell borrowed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Egypt,
and may in time prooue matter
to make a Calfe of. It is a ruled
case, Hee that doth not hinder

partakes in idolatry, that rootes
not out, where hee may, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
&amp; monuments of it. Nay,
suppose a superstitious person
come into thy house so swept
and garnished for him, and fall
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:2377:109"/>
downe, or vncouer his head, or
make secret prayers (as they must

to the images thou hast

wast not thou the bawd to his

oughtest to haue remoued this
stumbling blocke, and gotten

tempteth to spirituall fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as the scandalous presence
of a woman doth a light minde

a curse on him that layes a

can account it a ciuill vse of an

be taken away, or rather
a secret kinde of worship, at least
too much reuerence &amp; respect,
to set them vp, to cloath or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

to praise the curious workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of them, and commend
them to others so to bee. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
whatsoeuer a man may
doe with the gold in other vses,
sure I am, the gold of an image
is abominable, euen in priuate
vse, when the idoll is countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and not disfigured. Deut.

the Iewes might not vse them in

taking away the names of

               <p>If any say (which is the last

But the Papists giue diuine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to such creatures: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
&amp;c. For the assumption, the
scope of D. <hi>Reynolds</hi> his second
booke, <hi>De idololat. Rom. eccles.</hi> is
to proue that they giue diuine
worship to fiue such things, as
1. Saints, dead men. 2. Relikes,
rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bones. 3. Images, painted
blockes. 4. Consecrate things,
oyle, salt, spittle, waxe, creame.
5. Breaden hosts. And in the
same booke he affirmes, that to
worship a woodden crosse and a
piece of bread, is as grosse idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
as euer was.</p>

               <p>II. <hi>Pezelius,</hi> answering the

places, proues at large, that there
is no difference between Popish
and Heathenish idolatrie, <hi>nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus

changed. Pag. 225. <hi>Eadem est ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio

And Master <hi>White</hi> in his
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:2377:113"/>
booke forenamed, sect. 5. parag.

worship stocks and stones as the
Gentiles did.</p>
               <p>III. Master <hi>Perkins,</hi> in a book
of his owne setting forth, not in
few places, hath the very words,
Refor. Cath. 9. point: Papists vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
new termes maintaine the
idolatrie of the Heathen. Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
idolatrie is a grosse as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
any was among the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.
In the practice of a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Catholike, Popish idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
exceeds the idolatrie of the
Heathen, In his Aduertisement
to Romane Catholikes. And,
the Popish Host is as abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
an idoll as euer was. To
whom <hi>Bucer</hi> in Psal. 115. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
saying thus of the Popish
Church in worshipping of the
Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and the Saints, <hi>En
omnia facit, quae olim idolis suis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sana
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:2377:114"/>
gentilitas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IV. Adde one thing out of
the Scriptures: If Rome be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Egypt, Sodom, and Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
then the idolatry of all these
Heathenish places runs into it:
But the first is true, therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
the second. Againe, If it be a
cage of vncleane birds, and an
habitation of diuels, if any worse
can be said of any Heathens, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
idolatrie shall not be the
worst.</p>
               <p>3. Note,<note place="margin">Obser. 3.</note> that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
vttering so audible a voyce
concerning his Sonne, he will
be knowne of vs, not so much in
his owne substance, as in his
Sonne; nor by curious prying
into the excellencie of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie,
as by sober attending to
his voyce and Word. And the
many manners of Gods spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vnto men, all confirme the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:2377:114"/>
same: sometimes hee is said to
speake out of fire that none dare
approach; sometimes out of a
darke cloud (a cloud, because
out of mans reach; and darke,
because if it were not so, none
might satisfie their curiositie in
seeing any thing:) sometimes
out of a whirlewinde, a fierce
creature which men are afraid
of; and sometimes out of the
light, but such as is inaccessible.
And good reason, that such
high and diuine knowledge
should bee thus deliuered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
being matters of faith,
they must be insensible, and hee
that commeth to God, must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue,
not see; neither is the eye
of the body of such capacitie
and piercing brightnes, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
things of infinite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible
nature. God, in giuing
the Law, made a law against
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2377:115"/>
pryers and gazers, and seuerely
punished those that pryed into
the Arke.</p>
               <p>Those that despise the still
voyce of God in the ministery,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note>
shall neuer see God in Christ;
see him and feele him they shall
in his power and iustice, neuer

               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> no maruell if igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Egyptiacall darknesse
raigne in Popish countreyes,
where the voyce and Word of

and that the strength of his
kingdome of darknesse standeth

is, that relation which the
Father acknowledgeth between
himselfe and his Sonne. And
first, whereas there seemes to be
some difference in the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,
(for <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> chap.
3. 22. reade it in the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
Thou art my Sonne:) to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
other answeres, for recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
it is most probable, that
this voice was twice vttered:
first, for Christs confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to his office, in the second
person, which <hi>Marke</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi>
record; and after for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and the faith of
beleeuers, in the third person,
This is he, Take notice of him.
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:2377:116"/>
And this answere not onely sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies
the Text, but the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
formerly wherein this voice
was foretold, which runne in
both persons. Psal. 2. 7. Thou art
my Sonne: and Isa. 42. 1. Hee is
my Elect, in whom my soule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth.
By the Sonne of God
is meant, 1. Sonnes by <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
framed &amp; made after Gods
Image, in perfect holinesse and
righteousnesse. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> was
the sonne of God, Luk. 3. <hi>vlt.</hi> and
the Angels, Iob 1. and Psal. 89. 6.
2. Sons by <hi>Profession</hi> only, who
outwardly worship y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true God,
but not in truth: as Gen. 6. 1. <hi>The
sons of God saw the daughters of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
&amp;c.</hi> 3. Sons by <hi>Adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the children of wrath by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
are by grace &amp; fauour take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in to be the sons of God: thus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
true beleeuer, led by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
is the Son of God. Ro. 8. 14.
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:2377:116"/>
As many as beleeue, to them hee
gaue power to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sons of God.
Christ is none of these waies the
son of God: for although Christ,
as the fountaine and head of our
adoption, is called the chiefe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
many brethren, yet is hee
not adopted as we be. But he is
the Son of God two wayes:</p>
               <p>1. By nature, as God, begotten
from all eternity of the substance
of God, by an vnspeakable gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
(for who can tel his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
Isa. 53. 8.) whereby God
the Father communicated his
whole Essence vnto him: &amp; thus
hee alone is the Son of God, the
onely begotten Son, Ioh. 1. 14.
We may adore this Son-ship,
wee cannot search it out.</p>
               <p>2. By grace of personall V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:
and thus the man-hood of
Christ, or Christ as man, is after
a speciall manner the Sonne of
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:2377:117"/>
God, because his man-hood was
inseparably vnited to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the Sonne of God. Luk.
1. 32. That holy thing which is
borne of thee, shall bee called
the Sonne of God. Neither had
Christ (as man) any man to his
Father; but the humane nature
being framed of the holy Ghost,
subsifted in the Deity, and so
makes but one Person. And thus
Christ both in respect of both
his natures, and the Vnion of
them, is the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>How is he begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>
               </p>
               <p>After an vnspeakable manner,<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
much differing from humane
generation, wee may conceiue
no humane thing in it: 1. It
was without any alteration of
the Father, or passion in the
Sonne. 2. Without any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of any part of the God-head,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:2377:117"/>
but by communication of
the whole God-head of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Sonne. No naturall
father communicates his whole
Essence. 3. The Father begets
the Sonne in himselfe, not forth
of himselfe, as earthly Parents
doe. 4. Naturall fathers are
before their children in time;
but the Father so begets the
Sonne, as hee is not before in
time, but in order, both being
eternall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> Psalm. 2. 7. <hi>This day
begot I thee;</hi> therefore in time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In the Sonnes beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
are two things to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered:
1. The generation it
selfe, which is eternall. 2. The
manifestation of it, and this is in
time, at his Incarnation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.
Of this the place is
to be vnderstood, not of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:2377:118"/>
But Christ is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> God of
himselfe, and therefore not by
generation.</p>
               <p>Consider him in respect of
his God-head,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> and he is God of
himselfe as the Father and holy
Ghost: but consider him in his
Person, and so hee is the Sonne
begotten of the Father, and not
of himselfe: for the Father is a
beginning to the rest of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
And whereas the <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian
Creed</hi> confesseth him God
of very God; and the <hi>Nicen,</hi>
Light of light, and very God of
very God: the word (<hi>God</hi>) in
both places must bee taken not
essentially, but personally, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the Sonne of God begotten
of the Father.</p>
               <p>But the God-head of the Son
is from the Father,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> because the
Sonne is God?</p>
               <p>The God-head of the Sonne<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:2377:118"/>
is not begotten of the Father,
but the Person of the Sonne is
begotten: for the God-head of
the Sonne is without beginning
as the Father is; but the Person
of the Sonne is of the Father.</p>
               <p>But the Son hauing the same
Essence with the Father,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> then the
Father begetting the Sonne, the
Sonne begets himselfe also.</p>
               <p>Person begets Person,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Essence begets diuine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:
the Person of the Father
begets the Person of the Sonne,
but not the God-head of the
Sonne.</p>
               <p>If the Father and Sonne be
one in Essence,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> then the Sonne
being incarnate, so is the Father
also.</p>
               <p>It is a weake argument,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Incarnation belongs not
properly to the Essence, but to
the person; or the diuine Essence
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:2377:119"/>
of the Person of the Sonne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
incarnate and tooke flesh,
or if to the Essence, yet not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,
but limited.</p>
               <p>The whole diuine Essence is<note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
the Father: the Sonne is the
whole diuine Essence; therefore
the Sonne is the Father, not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
or begotten.</p>
               <p>There is an Homonymie in<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
the word (<hi>whole diuine Essence</hi>)
which is taken either essentially
and absolutely, as in the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition;
or personally, limited to
the second Person, as in the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption:
and therefore the
reason is faulty, because of foure
tearmes in it.</p>
               <p>But if the Father beget the<note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
Sonne, then hee communicates
either a part of his Essence, or
the whole: but hee can doe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
not a part, because it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuisible;
not whole, for then he
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:2377:119"/>
leaues none for himselfe.</p>
               <p>The Father begetting,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates
his whole Essence,
and yet retaines it wholly; as a
candle giuing light to another,
retaineth it wholly to it selfe.</p>
               <p>If the Father begot the Son,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
then either when the Son sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted,
or when he did not: if he
did subsist, how could hee beget
him? if he did not subsist, then
he had a beginning.</p>
               <p>The Father begot the Sonne<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
subsisting: for generation and
subsisting are in time together,
or rather both from eternity;
and in the Trinity there is <hi>nihil
prius,</hi> or <hi>posterius</hi> in time. And
thus also that obiection is stopt,
that the Father begetting, must
be before the Sonne begotten:
for the Father is not in time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Sonne, but in order.</p>
               <p>But Christ is the first begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:2377:120"/>
and the first borne of many
brethren, Rom. 8. 29. and Col. 1.
15. therefore he is not the onely
Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> The word (<hi>Primogenitura</hi>)
is sometimes a word of dignity,
and not of order.</p>
               <p>2. Christ is called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The first
borne of euery creature, because
hee was begotten eternally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any creature.</p>
               <p>3. He is called First borne,
by a Metaphor and resemblance,
being shadowed by the first
borne in the old Testament,
who were Heires and Priests in
the family, and had double por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
&amp;c. All which types were
verified in Christ, who was first
borne not of a few brethren in
one family as they, but of many
brethren in all Tribes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
               <p>Christ was the Sonne of the<note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:2377:120"/>
holy Ghost, because he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued

not of the substance, but po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of the holy Ghost. Againe,
consider him either according
to the flesh, so he was of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> not
of the holy Ghost: or according
to his Deity, and so hee was of
the substance of his Father, not
of the holy Ghost. But the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
(he is <hi>that</hi> my Sonne) is not
to be omitted, namely, <hi>that</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
seed &amp; Messias, on whom
all the fathers eyes haue been
fixed, whose day <hi>Abraham</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to see, on whom all the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes
cast their hopes, whom
all the Prophets with one
mouth haue declared and poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at, as with one finger: This
is that my Son, whom ye haue

Isa. 7. 14. Come out of Bethleem.

Hos. 11. 1. Out of Egypt haue I
called my Sonne. This is he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom <hi>Eliah</hi> hath prepared
the way, Mal. 3. 1. that is, <hi>Iohn</hi>

And as ye haue seen these things
already, so expect the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment
of all other predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
concerning him, till he hath
finished his course, &amp; the whole
worke of mans Redemption.</p>
               <p>Is Christ thus peculiarly the
Sonne of God?<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> then note the
wonderfull loue of God and of
Christ: God the Father setting
his onely Sonne separated from
sinners, and higher then the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens,
among sinners, to receiue
among them not only the badge
of sin, but the curse of sin, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hee was cast lower then earth,
and hell it selfe; that we might
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:2377:121"/>
by him become the adopted
sons of God: for this was the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
end, that we might be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his naturall Son, and so
to himselfe by him, and receiue
our title of Son-ship. And what
father that loued his son, would
so debase him, that hee might
take in some stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, yea an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to be heire with him? And
yet the loue of God hath done
thus for vs.</p>
               <p>Againe, the loue of Christ is
surpassing, and appeareth in his
voluntary and extreme abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that he would be pleased
from the height of his Glory,
being Gods naturall Son, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
not onely like, but lower
then all other men in his life
and death.</p>
               <p>No man liuing euer was or
can be so abased: for hee that is
lowest of all, can fall but from
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:2377:122"/>
one degree in earth to another:
but Christ falls from the highest
degree of the glory of heauen, to
the very bottome of hell. What
doth this infinite loue call for at
our hands, but returne of loue
for loue? Shall we thinke any of
his Commandements grieuous?
shall we think much of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
which God seeth fit for vs,
and Christ hath sanctifyed, be it
neuer so base? shall we refuse the
lowest abasement for his sake,
seeing we cannot bee brought
so low for him, as hee for vs?
Who art thou that professest
loue to Christ, and wilt not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
a word, a frowne of a supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,
a checke and rebuke for
his sake and good conscience?
Was Christs loue such to thee?
or, if it had, where had thy hopes
and saluation been? Had he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned
the frownes of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:2377:122"/>
for thee, the rebukes and
shame of the world, the cursed
death to which hee voluntarily
subiected himselfe, thou hadst
bin layd for euer vnder the
frownes of God the Father, and
the curse of thy sin: and though
thou seest that all the good of
his abasement came to thee,
thou wilt endure nothing for
him: Ah, conforme henceforth
thy loue to his.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> heere is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ground of comfort, that
we haue a most perfect and all-sufficient
Sauiour, not onely the
son of man, but the Son of God
almighty. Ioh. 3. 16. God so lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the world, that he gaue his

should beleeue in him,
should not perish, but haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting
life. All other sauiours
were meere sonnes of men, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua,</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:2377:123"/>
the Iudges, <hi>Iephte, Samson,</hi>
&amp;c. And their deliuerances but
temporall from the sonnes of
men: but heere is an eternall
Sonne of God, an heauenly Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,
and Saluation from all
spirituall enmities, worthy the
Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, namely, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
and dignity of his Person,
ariseth the excellency, price,
and merit of his obedience, both
actiue in fulfilling the law, and
passiue, in satisfying the breach.
For, being the naturall Sonne of
God, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not but be very God,
of the same substance and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
with the Father; vnto
which Diuine nature the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
being vnited, it receiueth
an excellency and dignity aboue
all created natures of men and
Angels: for, to which of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
did he at any time say, Thou
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:2377:123"/>
art my Sonne, Heb. 1. 5? And
hence all his obedience must
needs bee of infinite merit, the
Person being so infinite: else
could he not haue sustained the
infinite burden of mans sin, nor
appeased the wrath of his Father
infinitly offended, nor in so short
time haue made so full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
satisfaction, which must be
of infinite worth and desert, nor
haue vanquished so infinite ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
as sin, death, hell, and the
deuill, nor haue purchased for
vs that infinite and eternall
Crowne of righteousnes, vnlesse
he had been <hi>Immanuel,</hi> God
with vs, and for vs, blessed for
euer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Vse 3.</note> If Christ be that
true Sonne of God so declared
by the Prophets, then wee are
instructed,</p>
               <p>1. To beleeue in him: for
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:2377:124"/>
this is the Commaundement
of GOD,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3. 13. &amp; Ioh. 14. 1.</note> that we doe beleeue
in the Name of his Sonne.
Ye beleeue in God, beleeue also
in me. And the reason is, because
the Father and the Son are one.
Besides, no creature can be the
obiect of faith, which fixeth it
selfe vpon God, as Mar. 11. 22.
Haue faith in God: which word
(God) in the Creed is but once
named, to note the vnity of es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
yet in vnderstanding is to
be referred to all the three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
in whome we beleeue, and
in nothing else. And because we
must beleeue in him, wee must
pray not onely by him as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator,
but vnto him as God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
with the Father, into whose
name we are baptized. Thus the
Apostles prayed to him, Lord,
increase our faith: and a Leper
came and worshipped him, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:2377:124"/>
Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst
make me cleane, Math. 8. 2. And
often it is made a marke or note
whereby all Christians are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed,
that they are such as call
vpon the name of the Lord Iesus
Christ, Act. 9. 14. 1. Cor. 1. 2. In
one word, whatsoeuer diuine
worship is due to the Father, is
due to this Sonne of God: Rom.
15. 12. In him the Gentiles shall
trust, euery knee shall bowe vnto
him: and Ioh. 5. 23. That all men
might honour the Son, as they
honour the Father.</p>
               <p>2. We must esteeme and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
him as the Sonne of God,
accounting him the chiefe of
10000. as the Church doth, to
loue and reuerence him aboue
all other,<note place="margin">Psal. 45. 2.</note> saying, Thou art fayrer
then the sonnes of men: If any
man loue not the Lord Iesus, let
him be accursed, 1. Cor. 16. 22.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:2377:125"/>
Yea, account all things as losse
and dung in comparison of him,
hate father and mother, if need
so require, in respect of him, and
be so farre from being ashamed
of him and his profession, as to
acknowledge it the greatest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to suffer in his cause, 1. Pet.
4. 13.</p>
               <p>3. If Christ be the onely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
Sonne, then kisse the Son
of God, Psal. 2. 12. 1. In token
of subiection, as a kisse is if it be
of an inferiour to a superiour: so
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> said to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> All my
people shall kisse thee, Gen. 41.
namely, in token of subiection:
so Idolaters are said to kisse their
Idols, that is, to be subiect and
deuoted vnto them, 1. King. 19.
18. 2. In token of loue &amp; good
will, if from a superiour or equal:
thus the Saints must kisse one
another with an holy kisse. And
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:2377:125"/>
thus must euery Christian kisse
the Sonne of God, both in token
of their homage and subiection,
as also as a sure pledge of their
loue and faithfull affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him; especially wee must
take his yoke vpon vs, stoope
vnder his Scepter, and obserue
whatsoeuer hee hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vs. Doe as the people pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<hi>Ioshua,</hi> chap. 1. 16. All that
thou commandest vs, wee will
doe; whither thou sendest vs,
we will goe; whosoeuer rebell
and will not obey thy words, let
him die the death: and as <hi>Mary</hi>
his mother said to the seruants,
Whatsoeuer hee shall bid you
doe, that doe.</p>

               <p>The English is too short for
the Greeke, where we finde two

                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:2377:126"/>

                  </gap>) thy onely Sonne,
thy beloued Sonne.</p>
               <p>Christ is the proper obiect<note place="margin">Doct.</note>
of Gods loue, on whom all his
loue is cast, figured not onely in
<hi>Isaac,</hi> but in <hi>Salomon,</hi> 2. Sam.
12. 25. The Lord also loued him,
and called his name <hi>Iedidiah,</hi>
that is, the beloued of the Lord:
Christ is the true <hi>Iedidiah,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied
of Isa. 42. 1. Behold my
Elect, in whom my soule deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.
The Apostles expresse this
loue in sundry phrases: Ioh. 1. 18.
<hi>The onely begotten Sonne which is
in the bosome of the Father,</hi> hath
declared him; that is, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
and inwardly loued with
such affection, as is due onely to
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:2377:126"/>
her who is to be layd in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
who is thy best-beloued,
thy heart, thy selfe. And hee is
called Gods deare Sonne, Col.
1. 13.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> God loues him as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
as being one with him: The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
Father &amp; I are one, saith Christ;
in nature, in essence, in will, in
operation: looke with what
loue he loues himselfe, with the
same he loues his Sonne, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
begotten of the Father, full of
grace and trueth.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Christ is capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
and infinite loue, as no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is, and therefore is perfectly
and infinitely loued of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
hence is it that the Father
giueth him all that euer he hath,
Mat. 28. 18. All power in heauen
and in earth: hence he reuealeth
and declareth his whole counsell
to him, who from eternity hath
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:2377:127"/>
coexisted and layd in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
of his Father, whereas all
creatures are not capable of this
knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Christ as Mediator, is
most deare to his Father, and
beloued as a sea or fountaine,
from whose fulnesse loue must
be deriued to all other. Eph. 1. 6.
He hath made vs accepted in his
Beloued: the head of the body
must be filled with sense, and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and life, because it must send
these into all the members; so
the Head of the Church. As the
Apostle therefore saith, In him
are the treasures of wisedome, so
he is Gods store-house of loue,
whence all our supplies must be
fetched.</p>
               <p>Of consolation,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> 1. In respect
of Gods affection. 2. Of Christs
intercession. 3. Of our owne
acceptation. The <hi>first,</hi> if God
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:2377:127"/>
thus dearely loue Christ the
Head, he must needes dearely
loue the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers: whence Christ
prayeth thus, Ioh. 17. 23. That
the world may know, that thou
louest them, as thou hast loued
me, namely, with a fatherly and
free loue. What then if the child
of God be in want, distresse, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
death it selfe? God looking
on him in Christ, cannot but
pitty him: the wife and children
cannot so pitty and helpe vs,
when they can weepe about vs.
Psal. 103. 13. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Christs
intercession for vs, must needes
be powerfull and preuailing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he therefore euer liueth to
make requests for vs: and being
also euer loued, it must needes
be fruitfull for vs: he was heard
in all things in the dayes of his
flesh, and much more now in his
glory. We see what great suits
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:2377:128"/>
a Kings fauorite can carry away,
as <hi>Ahashuerosh,</hi> because <hi>Hester</hi>
found grace in his sight, would
not deny her to the halfe of his
Kingdome, and shee easily got
her suit for her selfe, and all her
people: But Christ shall not be
denied the whole Kingdome, if
he aske it for his Elect. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
hence comes in our boldnesse to
come to God, in the name, and
for the sake of Christ, in whom
our persons and prayers finde
acceptance: we in our selues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
enemies to God, strangers
from God and his couenant, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
forfaited all, are by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
receiued into such fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour,
as,<note place="margin">Ioh. 16 23, 24, 26.</note> Aske what wee will in
his name, in faith and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
and wee shall be spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>Of instruction,<note place="margin">Vers. 2.</note> in two things:
1. If God thought not his
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2377:128"/>
deare Sonne too deare for vs,<note place="margin">We must thinke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too deare for God, who thought not his Sonne too deare for vs.</note>
but, although his whole loue
was cast on him, would not spare
him, shall wee thinke any thing
too deare for him? If benefits
will binde, search heauen and
earth, you shall not finde such a
loue, which is left with an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
Ioh. 3. 16. God so loued
the world, &amp;c. And oughtest not
thou to giue vp thy soule, body,
and life it selfe as a reasonable
sacrifice for him? Oh the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of men, that are so farre
from this, as that they will not
part with a grain of their wealth,
with a dram of their credit, nor
with their base lusts! The proud
will not depart from his pride,
nor the drunkard with his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse,
nor the froward with
his malice and reuenge, for
Christ, and much lesse from li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
life, &amp;c. And what is the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:2377:129"/>
reason? Men loue their liues,
their lusts, &amp;c. and did not God
loue his Sonne more than thou
canst loue these? he set his whole
loue, euen an infinite loue vpon
him, and yet hee gaue him to
death for thee; and wilt thou
doe nothing, suffer nothing for
him? Wilt thou loue hatefull
things better than God, who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
not his dearest Sonne too
well for thee?</p>
               <p>2. If God so dearely loued
Christ his Sonne,<note place="margin">Motiues to stirre vp our loue to Christ.</note> so must we; we
want no reasons or motiues
thereunto: for first, hee loued vs
first not existing, yea resisting.
Secondly, he hath declared his
loue by innumerable gifts of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and soule, yea by that inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
gift of his owne bodie
and soule. Thirdly, hee hath
more to declare to vs hereafter
in greater things, which eye hath
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:2377:129"/>
not seene, eare hath not heard:
for hee will not be in heauen
without vs. Fourthly, God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
loue vs, if wee loue not his
beloued Sonne. Can a father,
who hath cast his whole affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on his childe, and worthily,
endure that hee should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuously
entreated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised?
The sentence is passed, If
any loue not the Lord Iesus, let
him bee accursed. Fifthly, the
greatest reason of all, is the strait
vnion and band between Christ
and the Christian; he the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
wee the building cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled;
he the roote, we the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ingrafted; he the Head, we
the body vnited; he the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
we the wife married: and
hence is the communication
betweene vs in natures, goods,
estates: he puts on our nature, to
cloath vs with his diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:2377:130"/>
he put vs in state of all his
goods, wisedome, righteousnes,
sanctification, and Redemption,
yea giues vs right to heauen, to
earth, and the creatures; he takes
on him our low estate, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
vs to his glory; yea our
troubles are his; in our wrongs
he is wronged, and whatsoeuer
is done to vs of well or woe, hee
takes it as done to himselfe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to recompence or reuenge
it. Now what an vnseemly and
confused sight were it to behold
the building falling off of the
foundation, the branches seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from the roote, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
cutting themselues from
the head, and the wife suing for
a diuorce, or at daggers with her
husband?</p>
               <p>Notes of our loue to Christ
are these:<note place="margin">5. Notes of the loue of Christ.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1. Often to thinke of him,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:2377:130"/>
and these thoughts bee deepe,
large, frequent, which argues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
affection in the soule:
Often out of that abundance
to speake of him, and neuer
but to his glory: for, where
we heartily loue, we can willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
praise. Thus the loue of God
in <hi>Dauids</hi> heart filled his mouth
and pen with often praises, Psal.
119. 164. Seuen times a day doe
I praise thee. Thus the Spouse
in the Canticles loued much,
and praised much; My beloued
is white, and ruddy, the fairest
of ten thousand, chap. 5. 10. Yea,
by this meanes bring others to
be in loue with him, as wee doe
with our deare friends. Psal. 31.
23. O loue the Lord; all ye his
Saints. Cant. 5. 16. His mouth is
as sweet things, he is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable:
this is my welbeloued,
and this is my louer, O daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:2377:131"/>
of Ierusalem.</p>
               <p>2. To bee carefull to please
and content him in all things:
the man I loue I will doe any
thing wherby I may please him,
I will abstain from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which will
offend and incense him. 2. Cor.
5. 9. We couet both at home
and from home to be acceptable
vnto him. I will not forget his
desire, his word, I will thinke the
time short and well spent to do
his requests. I will not impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
his loue in my heart or
mouth, but expresse it in my
whole course and calling, as
<hi>Peter</hi> was thrice enioyned to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
his loue to Christ in fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
his sheepe and lambes,
Ioh. 21. 16.</p>
               <p>3. Loue is bountifull: I will
spare nothing for my friend; all
I haue, is his to command and
vse, because my selfe am: sincere
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:2377:131"/>
loue is communicatiue, and will
be at cost for Christ: those that
loue Christ, first giue themselues
to Christ, and then their gifts,
their graces, their goods to the
vse of Christ and of his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
sincere loue is diligent,
and will refuse no paines to
please or pleasure the partie lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
what infinite paines will
men (that loue the world) take
for an handfull of it? and such as
loue Christ, will refuse no paines
to enioy, to glorifie him, as the
Apostles and Martyrs, in whom
we see how loue ouercommeth
all things, and the hardest paines
is pleasure to it.</p>
               <p>4. This Christian and holie
loue is ready to defend Christ:
no man can endure to heare or
see his friend abused; loue car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
a sympathy with it, that is,
a fellow-feeling, causing ioy or
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:2377:132"/>
griefe, to see his glory, Word, or
Kingdom aduanced or hindred:
it carries a godly zeale to Gods
house, which consumed <hi>Dauid,</hi>
Psalm. 69. 9. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi>
when GOD was dishonoured,
were mooued, and rent their
cloathes; and loue to Christ
makes a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take to heart things
against his name and honour:
nay, it makes the Christian rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to suffer with Christ and for
Christ, and accept of neuer so
hard a conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with him. Much
water cannot quench loue, nor
the flouds drowne it, Cant. 8. 6.
Yea if all the world should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
Christ, and sincere profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of him, sincere loue would
loue the more, and die with him
rather than deny him.</p>
               <p>5. Now in his absence to loue
him in his image, in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
because they loue him; in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:2377:132"/>
his Word &amp; Sacraments, which
are his letters and pledges; in
his gifts and graces, which are
his loue-tokens, and long to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his presence: for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
saith, Come: and the Bride
saith, Come, yea euen to be sick
of loue after him, Cantic. 5. 8.
Thus may wee trie our loue of
Christ, and shame our selues for
want of it, and stirre vp our
selues to grow vp in the image
of God, who hath set his whole
loue vpon him, and long after
the day when wee also shall set
our whole loue vpon him as he
vpon. vs.</p>

tincture of his bloud and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
and so are iustified and
accounted innocent and pure.
And thus, as it is said of the
Church, Ezek. 16. 14. we recouer
our former beautie, which is
made perfect through his beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. This was shadowed in the
old Testament, Ge. 8. 21. When
the earth was destroyed, and
<hi>Noah</hi> came out of the Arke, hee
offered burnt-offerings to the
Lord, and the Lord smelled a
sauour of rest, and said, I will no
more curse the earth, &amp;c. A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
type of Christ, the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
and maker of atonement
betweene God and man, from
whose meritorious sacrifice God
only smelleth a sauour of rest. So
likewise in <hi>Aaron</hi> the high
Priest, Exod. 28. 38. <hi>Aaron</hi> must
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:2377:134"/>
beare the iniquitie of the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
of the children of Israel,
and [Holinesse to the Lord] shall
be alwaies vpon his forehead, to
make them acceptable to the
Lord: here (saith <hi>Caluine</hi>) must
all our senses bee fixed vpon the
forehead of the only high Priest,
from whom all holinesse floweth
foorth to his Church: neither
could the Priest make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
acceptable in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but as hee stood a type of
Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Consider Christ 1. in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
God was so pleased in him,
as hee was neuer displeased, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was euer found in him
displeasing, no guile in his lips,
no spot in his person, but was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
a beloued Sonne: it is not so
with vs, who were before, the
sonnes of wrath, and <hi>Lo-ammi,
Lo-ruhamah.</hi> 2. Consider him
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:2377:135"/>
as Head of the Church and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour,
his obedience was so
voluntary, and satisfactory, so
full and meritorious, as must
needs appease his fathers wrath;
in him the Father hath his Law
wholly fulfilled, euen <hi>all righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes;</hi>
in him he hath the curse
borne &amp; carried away; in him he
hath a new righteousnes of faith
restored to beleeuers, and a new
image repaired vpon them: so as
now beholding them, not in the
first <hi>Adam,</hi> but in the second;
not in the old roote, but in the
new plantation; he loueth the
members, because he loueth the
Head, &amp; accepteth them as sons
through his beloued Sonne.</p>
               <p>To note the miserable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note>
of all them that are without
Christ, because they are as the
Gentiles, without God in the
world, without hope: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:2377:135"/>
else in the world can put
backe the wrath of God, there is
no name else vnder heauen in
which a man can be saued. How
fearefully is the wrath of God
come vpon the Iewes to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost,
who reiect this Corner
stone, and yet expect a Messiah
of their owne making? Neither
the cleere testimonies of the
Prophets, nor of <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor Heare
this voyce of the Father, nor his
own mighty works, haue moued
them, because hardnesse is come
vpon them till this day, and the
vaile is vpon their hearts, which
wee must pray that God would
in his time remooue. Those
mightie kingdomes of Turkes
and Heathens, who refuse the
Sonne of God, and will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him more than a
man, lye vnder Gods wrath, and
in the power of the diuell, and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:2377:136"/>
reiect the onely meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they should come into fauor
with God: which when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
as we are to pitie and pray
for them, so with praise and
gladnesse wee are to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
Gods goodnesse, whose
prouidence watched ouer vs to
be borne in the places and times
wherein Christ rideth most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
in the chariot of his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
that vnlesse we will wilfully
shut our eyes, and make our
condemnation heauyer than
theirs that neuer heard of him,
we must needs see the light shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
so brightly.</p>
               <p>The like may bee said of all
those damnable heretikes, who
haue denied Christ either in his
natures or offices: and here wee
must for euer renounce the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
heresie of the Church of
Rome, who, though in word
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:2377:136"/>
they hold the doctrine of faith,
yet in deed and by expresse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
deny both the natures
and all the offices of Christ, and
so professe a false christ, in
whom they cannot meete with
saluation. The case of worldly
and carnall gospellers is no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
who professe Christ their Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
not their Lord, denying him
their hearts and liues, and yet
with their mouthes say, Lord,
Lord.</p>
               <p>Againe,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> seeing God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed,
that Christ is that his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued
in whom he is onely well
pleased, away with other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atours,
other intercessors, none
can be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> but he, He onely
was found worthy to open the
booke, Reuel. 5. 5. God neuer
professed himselfe well pleased
in any but he, though with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hee hath been. Away with
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:2377:137"/>
those fond deuices of merits,
and workes of supererogation;
away with Popes pardons, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
wee can bring such a voyce
from heauen for any other man:
away with foreseene faith and
foreseene workes, with which
some men say God was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and so moued to elect his
people. No, no, onely Christ
is the delight of God, hee is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
in nothing but him, and
that which he sees through him:
giue him the honour of a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Sauiour, able to appease
and please his Father, able to
tread the Wine-presse alone; or
else giue Gods testimonie the
lye, as all they doe, that dote
vpon any other meanes of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and appeasing God than
Christ alone.</p>
               <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Vers. 3.</note> seeing our selues out
of him can finde no acceptance,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:2377:137"/>
let vs labour to be found in him,

for vs; if wee can say Christ is

we are in Christ?<note place="margin">Quest.</note>

               <p>The generall vse of this whole

17. 5. <hi>Heare him:</hi> for by this voice
Christ is now appointed both,
1. The Doctor and chiefe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:2377:138"/>
of the Church, more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
then <hi>Moses;</hi> for He is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
as the <hi>Sonne</hi> in all the house
of God. 2. The high Priest of
our profession, whose lips must
preserue knowledge, infinitely
aboue <hi>Aaron,</hi> a most mercifull
high Priest, able to saue them
that come vnto God by him, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he liueth for euer to make
intercession for vs. 3. The only
King of his Church, a greater
than <hi>Salomon,</hi> of whom all the
Kings of Israel were but sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes;
who only maketh Lawes
for his Church, and of such po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
as they binde conscience,
which no King nor Lawes can
doe.</p>
               <p>1.<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> Hee is the Angell of the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> great counsell, the chiefe Doctor
and Interpreter of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the Iudge of all controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and interpretations, and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:2377:138"/>
therefore onely to be heard.
What? is not the Church to be
heard? the Preachers of the
Word to be heard? yea, the one
as the Spouse of Christ, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as Ministers of Christ: only
Christ himselfe as receiuing this
dignity,<note place="margin">Mat. 23. 8.</note> to be the <hi>onely Master</hi>
of his Church; they had streams,
but hee the fountaine of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
hee had treasures of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
hid in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. This is a note of the true
Church, both of Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.
Ioh. 8. 47. He that is of God,
heareth the words of God: my
sheepe heare my voyce: and
Ioh. 10. 16. Other sheepe I haue,
which are not of this fold, that
is, the Gentiles not yet called;
these must be brought vnto me,
for they shall heare my voyce.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Christ the Lord of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Prophets, hath put an end to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:2377:139"/>
all prophecies, ceremonies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelations,
and dreames, &amp; these
many, extraordinary meanes
whereby he taught his Church
of olde: and now God hath spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vnto vs by his Son, to whom
all they made way, Heb. 1. 1. He
is that Messiah of whom the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan
woman said, Ioh. 4. 25.
I know that the Messiah will
come, and when he shall come,
he will declare all things. They
that liued before him, made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to heare him, because hee
was expected from the bosome
of the Father, to reueale all the
will of God, and all necessary
trueth concerning saluation;
how much more should we, who
haue heard all things, all his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and seene his miracles, as
the Samaritans did, Ioh. 4. 42.
We haue heard him speake our
selues?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:2377:139"/>
4. If wee consider our owne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
naturall blindnesse, and grosse
ignorance in the things of God,
how apt wee be to seduction,
schisme, heresie, delusion, wee
shall see how necessary it is to
heare him: nay, seeing God hath
of mercy set him out to preserue
vs from these euils, great and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testable
shall our vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
be, to turne away from
him.</p>
               <p>Now if it be asked how wee
must heare Christ, the answere
is this:</p>
               <p>1. Hee must now be heard in
the voyce of his Ministers, to
whom he gaue gifts at his ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and of whom he said, <hi>Hee
that heareth you, heareth mee:</hi> so
farre as they can prooue that
which they teach, to be his voice,
they must be heard, and further
we must not heare Fathers, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:2377:140"/>
Councels, nor the Pope
of Rome: for himselfe is still the
chiefe Doctor, and chiefe Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter
of the Scriptures, and
Iudge of all controuersies in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>2. To heare him, is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to lend him our eares in the
ministry, (for many Iewes, Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises,
wicked Romans, &amp;c. heard
his owne gracious words, and
yet heard him not:) but, to <hi>heare
him,</hi> is, 1. to repent and beleeue
the Gospell: for this was the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
and summe of Christs
preaching, Math. 4. 17. and Ioh.
12. 36. Beleeue in the Light, that
yee may be the sonnes of the
Light. 2. To loue one another.
This is the new Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That we loue one another,
Ioh. 15. 12. and is most expresse,
1. Ioh. 3. 23. This is the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That wee beleeue in the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:2377:140"/>
name of his Sonne Iesus Christ,
and loue one another. 3. To
obey him in whatsoeuer he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth:<note place="margin">Ioh. 10. 27.</note>
His sheepe <hi>heare his
voyce, and follow him:</hi> and, Math.
28. 20. Teach them to obserue,
and to doe all things that I haue
commanded you.</p>
               <p>Heereby many sorts of men<note place="margin">Vse</note>
are reproued, that heare not the
voyce of Christ: Papists heare
the voyce of the Church, and of
traditions, reuelations, false mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,
yea the voyce of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ:
the Atheist heares the
voyce of reason, Lawes of men,
and perswasions of fleshly wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
but the Apostles thought
it fitter <hi>to obey God then man,</hi> Act.
5. 29. The naturall man heares
the voyce of the serpent, as <hi>Adam</hi>
did, though Christs voyce be
neuer so loud against the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the forbidden fruit: Yea,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:2377:141"/>
men that professe better things,
may heare the voyce of wiues,
children, parents, yea, the voyce
of profit and vnlawful pleasure,
before and aboue Christs voice;
<hi>Salomon</hi> himselfe heard the
voyce of his idolatrous wiues,
till GOD rent the Kingdome
from him: so as the best of vs
had neede be stirred vp by
this voyce from heauen,
<hi>Heare him.</hi>
