         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But in case any inordinate liuer shall be brought to a sight and sense of his sin, while hee is yet meat-whole, as we say: here he may, by Gods grace, find comfort. And as for that other taske to teach men the way to repentance, others haue bestowed profitable pains therein; and especially of late a learned and reuerend Predecessour of mine, M. <hi>Mason,</hi> in his <hi>Tribunall of Conscience.</hi> Wherein for the point of moralitie, in the examination of a mans

life, he hath taken worthy paynes. Onely I could wish, if his leasure did serue, that hee would bee pleased to add thereunto a Rule how to examine a mans Errours in point of Faith, and of the sound knowledge of the Mystery of Christ. For where this foundation of sound and sauing knowledge is not rightly layd in the heart, as the foundation, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer repentance a man goes about to frame or erect, it either falleth, as built on the Sand, or vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth away in an ayerie imagination. For the purpose: How can a man,


<pb facs="tcp:25199:19"/>
that either is ignorant of the grace of Christ, of the Gospell of God, and of the nature of sauing Faith, or else is arrogant in the singularitie of his owne opinion, wherein he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneth the whole foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Grace, euer come to true repentance for his sinne? For true repentance is a speciall gift of Grace: It is an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate fruit of sauing Faith illuminating and sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart, and whole man: and God giues this grace to no malicious ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie of Grace, but to such as hauing receiued it, are thankefull for it, as a gift


<pb facs="tcp:25199:20"/>
of Gods free grace in Christ, flowing from the Fountaine of Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall loue in electing vs in Christ, before the World was.

               <p>True: Notwithstanding such is the malignant poyson of sin euen in the regenerate, that though the dominion thereof be taken away, so as it cannot lead the faithfull away captiue to death eternall: yet the guilt of it may so sease vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Conscience, the thicke cloud of his sin may so eclipse Gods louing countenance from him, as that hee may for the time seeme in his owne apprehension, to bee a very

Euen as a father, when his sonne hath offended, yea hath beene hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for it, confessed it, intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted pardon of his Father; though his father cannot put off the bowels of naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, nor ceases to loue his sonne still, but purposeth to bestow the inheritance vpon him, yet shewes him nothing but an angry countenance, layes the rod vpon him, threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to disinherit him, and all this but in loue &amp; wisedome, disciplining his sonne, both for the sounder reformation of what is past, and securer preuention of further offences which otherwise hee might fall into. It is the Apostles comparison, <hi>Whom the Lord

loueth, he chastiseth, and scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth euery sonne whom he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.

               <p>The second pillar and prop of Faith in the Soules faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is experience of former fruition of mercie. This was <hi>Dauids</hi> practise, <note place="margin">Ps. 77.</note>

               <p>One ingredience more would here be added, as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to cause our godly sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to worke the more kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually, to recouer sound health to the soule. For it may so come to passe, that the offence, which the world hath taken at a mans sinne, may affect a mans heart so much the more with sorrow, because it hath brought a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputation vpon his person, and a staine vpon his good name; whereas otherwise


<pb n="63" facs="tcp:25199:54"/>
perhaps hee would haue made light of that sinne, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the world, and so haue still continued in it. And againe it oftentimes, yea too vsually comes to passe, that for want of sound and solid repentance for former sinnes, God suffers his child euen to fall into some scandalous sin with the world, that so at length hee may bee throughly cast downe for all, and come to a perfect hatred of all sinne. And surely one sinne soundly and thorowly repented of, doth mightily and maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously arme a man against the tempters assaults for the time to come, if it be but attended with a small guard of a wary watchfulnesse: Whereas on on the contrary, repentance slubbered ouer, and dallied

Or as phisicke, not working kindly, doth but fit the body for more diseases. For this cause then, that we leaue no one corner of our deceitfull hearts vnswept and vnransackt, it is behouefull for vs to call our selues to a strict and seuere account for all our former old sinnes, and vpon a <hi>melius inquirendum</hi> to enter into iudgement with our selues a fresh for them, as


<pb n="65" facs="tcp:25199:55"/>
finding them now guilty of Treason, which before happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we condemned but of petty Larceny; when as now wee may iustly deeme, that for want of due humiliation and sorrow for them, they (as a theefe saued from the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that should haue beene put to death) haue beene rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to cut our throate, by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vs on to the more bold committing of sinne. For as we prophecy in part, so wee practise repentance, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties in part. And the more imperfect our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is for sinne past, wee are not onely the more weake to stand out and resist temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to subdue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of our corruptions, but the further short we come of the inioying of those solid


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:25199:56"/>
comforts of Gods Spirit, which it poureth in greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance into the most peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent soule: So that for the greater strengthning of the wounded soule fainting vnder the waight of some great temptation for a new sinne, it is necessary to renew our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in a greater measure then euer, for all our old sins; that so the more ground wee sow with godly sorrow, wee may reape the more plentifull haruest of consolation. This was <hi>Dauids</hi> practise. In his old age, and vpon that great sinne of his, hee prayes the Lord <hi>not to remember the sinnes of his youth,</hi> which no doubt he had long agoe repented of, but now vpon so fearfull a fall, being driuen aground by the tempest of temptation, he

               <p>The fifth Preseruatiue of Conscience, distressed with the feare of Gods displeasure, is Prayer. O the sweet and souerain helpe, which Prayer, frequent, feruent, faithfull, humble Prayer subministreth to the Soule, when plunged in the deepth of perplexed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours! As <hi>Dauid,</hi> in that short, but pithy Penitentiall, <hi>Out of the deepes haue I cryed vnto thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ps. 130.1</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:25199:57"/>
thee.</hi> Prayer is of force to bring againe the dead Child, to rayse dead <hi>Lazarus,</hi> euen the stinking Soule, out of the Graue. No place, no case of calamitie, Spirituall or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, whence Prayer may not procure deliuerance. Onely out of Hell is no deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance. Why? They pray not there to God. In the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>Diues</hi> prayed, but to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to a Saint, not to God; enough to cause his prayer to be reiected, as not worth a drop of cold water. A good example for all such Clyents, as inuocate Saints for their Aduocates. A practise learned from <hi>Diues</hi> in Hell, but which findeth neither Precept nor Promise in the Scriptures, and so can hope for no better successe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:25199:58"/>Now among the many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable vses and effects of prayer, two are of singular note: the first, that prayer is a most effectuall antidote to preuent the committing of sinne. What neede I speake of the infinite experiments my selfe haue found in this kinde? Let euery child of God but take notice of his owne proofes herein. For my part, how many forcible temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, prouocations, inuitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, occasions to sinne haue made battery vpon this weak Fort, when it hath beene rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to hang out the flagg of parle, and of yeelding: and onely prayer steps betweene, working a suddaine &amp; strange alteration in the affections? it bringeth a fresh supply of of grace, fortifieth the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest


<pb n="71" facs="tcp:25199:58"/>
places, repaireth the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, repulseth the batteries, causeth the enemy for that time to retreat. I could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce strange instances in my selfe, but I forbeare. Nor is there any lawfull affaire of this life, but if prayer haue an oare in it, it makes the better way to arriue at the wished port. But for the preuenting of sinne, and restraining of our inordinate passions, it is in a manner the onely effectuall meanes. Neuer hath any temptation further preuailed, but as prayer hath beene neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: I am sure this is true in mine owne experience. And surely where the daily practise of prayer is not, there it is no maruaile, if Sathan keepe his reuels. <hi>Dauid,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the many corruptions


<pb n="72" facs="tcp:25199:59"/>
and abominations of wicked men, and persecuting Tyrants, hee renders the reason of all, <hi>They call not vpon the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psa. 14·4</note> But doe not such men pray? Yes, they may; but as the Pharisees, in an outward for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malitie, and vnder a colour of long prayer, they deuoure widdowes houses. Who are more for a ceremonious and solemne formalitie of endlesse and superstitious prayers, then the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which yet the Holy Ghost styleth the great Whore? Can such blind prayers be effectuall, but to pull down vengeance vpon their heads, which by their pompous solemnitie haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined the verie ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke, and Pillar of all true Religion and deuotion, the preaching of the Word, now


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:25199:59"/>
turned into Masse and Matins? But no maruaile, if the Seuen-branched golden Candlesticke be there remoued, and turned into an Idoll-Altar, where the verie <note n="*" place="margin">Prayer in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue.</note> Light of Deuotion is quite put out, and the Oyle dryed vp.</p>
               <p>The second principall vse of Prayer, is, after a man hath beene ouertaken with a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in any degree, tending at least to the actuall commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of sinne, and to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it in the lust thereof, to rayse vp the humbled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to a hopefull expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to a constant affiance, and in fine, to a comfortable frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods mercie. We see what strong cryes <hi>Dauid</hi> (all along the most peerelesse pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of practick pietie in this kind) lifted vp, when his soule


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:25199:60"/>
was cast downe for his sinne; as all his Penitentials, but spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the 51, doe witnesse. And surely had not the sinne-burthened Soule accesse to the Throne of Grace, and Mercie by the meanes of Prayer, what hope were there? But Prayer is like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Doue, which returning, brings the poore sinner tidings, that the Deluge of Gods wrath is asswaged, and in token thereof presents him with the Oliue-branch of peace and reconciliation. Or as when God is on his March against vs, with his great Army of terrible Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Prayer is the Herald, sent to make an humble treaty for truce. And therefore in all Spirituall conflicts, there is no dutie, which Satan goes about more to diuert from, or


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:25199:60"/>
disturbe in, then this of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Yea, he is readie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent a man with, and to foist in, a thousand by-occasions, or cogi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ations, either about our profits or pleasures, thereby to diuert the Soule from prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, perswading a man, he may doe that as well another time, as now. And it is more then proaable, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was thus carried away, when, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a yeeres space, that sinne of his in the matter of <hi>Vriah,</hi> and <hi>Bathshabe,</hi> lay as a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Serpent, sleeping in his bosome, vnrepented of, till <hi>Nathan</hi> came, and by his Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle vncharmed it, and so rowsed him from his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But did not <hi>Dauid</hi> all that while exercise the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Prayer? Had he not at


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:25199:61"/>
least the Arke in his Court, and there his morning and euening Sacrifices of Prayer?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No doubt. But it is likely, hee contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the publike solemn Seruice and Sacrifice of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, neglecting in the meane time his more intimous and priuate deuotion, wherein hee should haue more punctually humbled his Soule, cast him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe downe naked in Gods presence, and made speciall supplication for the pardon of his sinne, and so haue demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe in his holy wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God in secret, as he could not doe in publike with any decorum, or without bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing censured by men, of indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion or folly; As <hi>Hannah</hi> for her zeallous prayer was thought of <hi>Eli</hi> to haue beene


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:25199:61"/>
drunke or madde. Or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, not intermitting his times of priuate prayer, yet hee remitted of that feruour and zeale, of that extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie sorrow, and teares, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for obtaining the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of such a sinne. Or if among other his sinnes hee bewayled this sinne, yet hee went not to the quicke, hee searched not the wound to the bottome. His repentance as yet was but an ordinarie, and euerie-day-repentance, whereas his extraordinarie sin required an extraordinarie sorrow. Hee might also the while pray for mercie and pardon, but not so effectually and heartily for such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of mercie, as his sinne required. And the reason, that his repentance, and conse<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>quently


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:25199:62"/>
his praier for pardon, at the best, was not yet so sound, as it ought (which was the cause, that as yet he found not that comfortable fruition of Gods fauour and mercie, as afterwards vpon his more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious repentance) was, his want of due consideration in waighing the horriblenesse, and hugenesse of his sinne. For when <hi>Ioab</hi>'s messenger brought <hi>Dauid</hi> word of <hi>Vri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s death,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 11 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or bearing himselfe vpon being King, perhaps he


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:25199:62"/>
might applaude his owne wit in such a prittie inuention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seconded with a success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full execution, thinking it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that euen a loyall, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent subiect should perish, then the Kings honor receiue the least blemmish; though indeed hereby it was the more fowlly stayned, and euen double dyed with that crymsin sinne. As though the committing of a new sinne, should helpe to expiate the former. Or as though for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing <hi>Vriah</hi>'s wife, hee should make amends in taking away his life. But thus by going about (politickly as hee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined) to hide his sinne of Adulterie, hee raysed the <hi>Hue and Cry</hi> of innocent blood to proclaime and paint it out to all the world. In what a fooles


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:25199:63"/>
paradise was <hi>Dauid</hi> all this while, trow you? But the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> puls off the Visar, and lets him see his monstrous two-faced sinne.

But now by Gods mercie comming more sadly and wistly to take a view of it, he suddainly breakes out into this lamentable voyce, <hi>I haue sinned against the Lord.</hi>

himselfe, as it hath beene an eye-sore to the world. Thus by one meanes or other will God bring his Children vpon their knees, if a kindly sorrow vvill not vvorke it, a publicke shame shall.</p>
               <p>Thus (to returne vvhence vvee digressed) effectuall prayer for the pardon of sinne issueth not, but from true and vnfained repentance, as this from a true knowledge, and due estimate of our sinne. Though that vvhich helpeth to expresse and vvring teares from <hi>Dauid</hi>'s heart, vvas the enumeration of Gods fauours towards him by <hi>Nathan,</hi> deeply aggrauating his sinne, and making it out of measure sinfull; as we touched before. As <hi>Peter,</hi> after his three deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, thinkes not yet vvhat hee


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:25199:64"/>
had done, till the Lord lookes vpon him, and then the verie reflection of that gratious countenance of his deare Master, checking him for his ingratefull disloyaltie, yet as the Sun-beame thawing and melting his verie heart, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen by the High Priests fire, causeth him to goe out, and weepe bitterly.</p>
               <p>The sixt preseruatiue is, the example of the Saints,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10 11. Rom. 15.4.</note> who haue beene raised euen from fearful fals.

Secondly,


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:25199:65"/>
they teach vs, that if we haue fallen, and that in our fairest way, where we neuer suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed falling, we should not lye still, but speedily get vp again. Nor let any man be out of hope for the greatnesse of his fall, as if it were vnrecouera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

Indeede Satan is euer in his extreames; he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther possesses a man that his sinnes are lesse then they be, that so hee may neuer come soundly to repent of them: or else, when the sinner begins to be humbled, and to be ouer-shooes in sorrow, the diuell is ready to push him ouer boots, yea to plunge him ouer head and cars; he presents him with a false glasse, wherein he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds his sinnes beyond all measure monstrous, and aboue all example.

before, whereof ye haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of highest nature, of sundry kinds. For we speake not here of diabolicall sinne, committed with a high hand, and such, for which a man finds no place for repentance, as prophane <hi>Esau,</hi> or <hi>Iudas,</hi> or those Pharisees and high Priests which sinned against the holy Ghost.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.9</note> But we speake of the sinnes incident to Gods Saints, which for the outward act, are not inferiour to the greatest sinnes of reprobates, but they differ mainely in the inward affection. <hi>Iudas,</hi> for loue of mony betraid his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; <hi>Peter,</hi> for feare of his life, denied him: both repented<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the halter sent <hi>Iudas</hi> to his place, mercy receiued <hi>Peter</hi> to his Apostleship. <hi>Ahab</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted murther for a field,

                  <hi>Dauid</hi> for a wife: both repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But as their hearts main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differed in the committing of sin, so in their repentance: so that <hi>Dauid</hi> vpon his harty repentance, obtained remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his sinne, but with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall iudgements, to his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther humiliation &amp; saluation. <hi>Ahab,</hi> vpon his hypocriticall repentance, obtained an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission, or adiournment of temporall punishment, to his vtter condemnation and perdition. For <hi>Ahab</hi> (as all such reprobates) committed sinne with his whole heart, but repented by halfes: <hi>Dauid</hi> (as the Regenerate) on the contrary; they sinne by halfes, but repent with their whole heart. For the reprobate is all flesh, all the old man: but the regenerate is diuided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene


<pb n="91" facs="tcp:25199:68"/>
the old man and the new: <hi>It is no more I that sinne</hi> (saith <hi>Paul</hi> in the person of the regenerate) <hi>but sinne that dwelleth in me.</hi> In the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, in the seruice of sinne, the flesh is wholly taken vp, but in spirituall duties it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together lame, and vntoward, as the fish out of his element. But in the regenerate, it is the flesh onely that sinneth, but the spirit only that repenteth. And though we cannot so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly discerne this difference of sinne by the outward act: suffice it, that God, who seeth not as man seeth, clearely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth, to put a maine diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the sinnes of the one, and of the other, to giue repentance, or to deny pardon.</p>

racked vp to the highest pin by the height of my holy calling, the deeper I must bee plunged in the verie gulfe of griefe, and humiliation for the same. Considering, that as great a Sacrifice was offered for the Priest's sinne alone,<note place="margin">Leui. 4.3, 14.</note> as for the whole Congregation, though each sinned alike in the same kind. <hi>Dauid, Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Peter,</hi> all smarted for their sinne. And who would buy sinne at so deare a rate, as they payd for it? But yet they found mercie, and fauour at Gods hand. This was their comfort. And their example is my comfort also. For why should any man, beholding such examples of Gods super-abundant mercy in pardoning sinnes of highest nature, hee hauing sinned, not by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:25199:72"/>
of their example, but by the imprudence of his own impotent passions: Why (say I) should any man, out of a comfortlesse deiection, shut himselfe out from all hope of Gods mercie, as an abiect or out-cast, and not rather with the hand of Faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which neuer knew how to be repulsed, knocke at that gate of Grace, which so easily was opened to them, yea which of its owne accord, more readily then that yron gate did to <hi>Peter,</hi> will open to euerie faithfull penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Yea, for this cause, for our sakes, are those examples written, and left as euerlasting monuments, that no Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, no Idolater, no denyer of Christ, should despaire of mercie vpon repentance. And


<pb n="100" facs="tcp:25199:73"/>
though these examples are written for all, yet are they most proper for Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, when they are humbled for any sinne or offence against God, or his people, least the checke of their holy calling might altogether amate them and leaue them comfortlesse, and so expose them as a prey, to the Destroyer. But blessed be God, who hath prouided such Treacle, made of the Mummy of his dead Saints, to cure his liuing ones of the Serpents mortall Sting.</p>
               <p>Yet, the while, I ascribe no more to these examples, but as excellent adiuuants to faith, it being the principall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby the Soule, in her deepest thirst, as with a bucket, drawes the waters of comfort out of the Wells of

to wit, the fruit, which true humiliation worketh in the soule.

Now the fruit which true repentance bringeth forth, is that which differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it mainly from counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit repentance. For counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet repentance may be very like the true; like that of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> consisting of contrition, confession, and satisfaction: but what was the fruit of it? <hi>he went &amp; hanged himself.

                  <hi>When thou art conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, strengthen thy brethren.</hi> And who more fit to comfort others consciences, then they that haue been exercised with the bitter conflicts thereof themselues?

calling him a <hi>sonne of blood, and of Belial?</hi> Yet <hi>Dauid</hi> meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holds on his course in bringing forth fruits worthy of repentance, the benefit whereof might redound to all that feare God.</p>
               <p>For a conclusion of this point, let the penitent labor to get assurance to himselfe of the fauour of God, and that by the obseruation of two things: first, of Gods dealing with vs since our sinne, and vpon our repentance for the same, I cannot say simply, after our repentance, sith our whole life must be a continuall repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And first, to obserue the comforts of God in vs. Where we must note, that God is very wary in pouring into our wounded soules a greater plenty of the oyle of


<pb n="117" facs="tcp:25199:81"/>
comfort, but with much mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the sharpe corrosiue vinegar: yea, he distilleth his balme but by small drops, and as patients newly recouered from a strong feuer, diets vs with small bits, and pittances at a time, least by ouerfull a diet, the weake stomacke of the soule be ouercome with a surfet, and so fall into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laps. Secondly, to obserue the strength and ability which God hath left vs, I meane of spirituall grace, whereby we are assisted in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of spirituall duties, publike and priuate, domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, or Ministeriall. Herein may hee comfort himselfe, when vpon his repentance, he findeth the graces of Gods spirit no way abated, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by prayer increased, and


<pb n="118" facs="tcp:25199:82"/>
his zeale to Gods glory and his truth more inflamed now, then formerly, as being incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by a kinde of holy indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and reuenge for his sinne, to expose himselfe to the greater malice and oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy of the world, whose ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is doubled against those, who are most couragious and zealous for the truth. So that when a man obserueth how the Lord prospereth his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauours and labours with a rich successe of the seruice of Gods people, he may with the greater comfort and courage goe on, this being a notable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence of grace, of his recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, of that well of liuing water in his soule, springing vp vnto euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life. Notwithstanding by the way all along he meete


<pb n="119" facs="tcp:25199:82"/>
with many rubs, and obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, difficult to incounter with, but more difficult to ouercome, as will appeare in the insuing Conflicts. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled to God, yet the penitent shall finde a world of discomforts, or the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforts of the world, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise his patience, meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and humility. Euen as a Ship riding at anchor in the Rode or Harbour, hauing es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped the stormes in the main Ocean, yet is tumbled and tossed with sundry proud waues and billowes, that it hardly findes any steddie rest.</p>
               <p>The second thing, is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue certaine infallible marks and tokens of grace in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent soule; and these are (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those reckoned vp by


<pb n="120" facs="tcp:25199:83"/>

By imagining his people to be so good, so wise, as measuring their Minister by themselues, to bee a man of like passions, they will the rather compassionate that in him, whereof they haue so iust cause to complain and bewayle in themselues? Alas! This is a cold comfort, for a man to be pittied for his folly. And a generous mind will disdaine to build its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vpon a base fantasie. Nay rather, may hee not expect


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:25199:90"/>
contumely, in stead of pittie, and contempt, in stead of Christian compassion? For where shall hee find such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? Will not a mote in his eie seeme greater to them, then the beame in their own? Will they not the more light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leape ouer the blocke of their owne grosse iniquities, by stumbling at the strawe of his infirmitie? By straining his g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

sinne: So hee is more subiect to manifold and more violent temptations, and that through the malice and enuy of Satan, who knoweth, that if he can smite the Sheepherd, hee may the more easily scatter the Flocke; And if his garment bee but scinged with one of his fierie Darts, yealding some ill sauour, either they may impute it to his imbecillitie, or negligence, taken napping then, when hee should haue watched: or to their neglect of prayer for him to be kept holy and blamelesse, he hauing no lesse need of their prayers, then they of his: or else they may impute it to some sinne, which themselues doe liue in without repentance, for which God may punish them in their Pastour, as <hi>Israel</hi> was


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:25199:91"/>
made subiect to three dayes pestilence at the best, through the sin of <hi>Dauid</hi>'s numbring the people, to which God suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him to bee stirred vp by Satan. So that thus the people reflecting vpon themselues, and bearing a part of their Ministers offence, they may seeme to lighten the burthen of his distressed Conscience. But (alas!) who will duely weigh the infinite perils, which the best Saints of God, but especially his Ministers, doe continually incounter with? Or who takes thought to pray for him? Hee must pray for all; as <hi>Iob</hi> for his Children, while they were a feasting; But who for him? Although the neglect hereof may bring an old house vpon the carelesse peoples heads,


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:25199:92"/>
as it befell <hi>Iob</hi>'s Children. Or which of the people will smite the hand vpon his own thigh, and say, My customarie and vsuall sinnes, as in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull dealling, either with men in my Trading, or with God, in my lying, or in my swearing, or prophaning the sacred Ordinances of God, or the like, hath beene the cause, in part at least, why God might in iustice suffer this or that temptation to preuaile ouer my Pastour, to the further imperilling of mine own Soule, by hardning me in my sinne, through his example, which otherwise should make mee the more cautelous, least I abuse his weakenesse (for which I know not how greatly hee is humbled) to my wilfulnesse


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:25199:92"/>
in committing, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in sinne?</p>
               <p>Or else, may not his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science perhaps find comfort, by considering, that though a Ministers conuersation bee of great moment to win the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to God, yet it is not that, which the people must build vpon for their saluation, but the sound Doctrine which he teacheth. It is Christ's rule: <hi>The Scribes and Pharisees sit in Moses his Chayre;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Math. 23 2.</note> 
                  <hi>All there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whatsoeuer they bid you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, that obserue and doe; But doe not after their workes; For they say and doe not.</hi> But (alas!) howsoeuer this be true, and may serue to establish the hearts of Gods people against the stumbling blocke of his delinquencie: Yet in the meane time, what comfort

can himselfe reape from hence? Yea, doe wee not see by common experience, that a small scandall in a Minister, be it habituall, or but in some one act, wherein hee walkes not, workes more vpon the generall corruption of the people, then the example of all his vertues, ioyned withall his painfull, and sound preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is able to counteruaile? So that, though a few will follow his Doctrine for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake, as being the Word of God: Yet the most and greatest part, especially among the rude and vndisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined rustickes, will rather chuse to liue by the least bad example. As Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> vpon those words (<hi>Doe men gather Grapes of Thornes</hi>) saith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug in Euang. Ioh. Ser. 1.</hi>
                  </note> Euill Ministers are Thornes,


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:25199:93"/>
which sitting in <hi>Moses</hi> his Seate, the Vine of good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in-twines, and wrapes about them; Doe thou gather the Grape, so as the Thorne may not pricke thee; that is, what they say, doe thou; but after their doings, doe not; Their doings are Thornes, their sayings are Grapes, springing from the Vine of the Word, from <hi>Moses</hi> his Seat. But (saith he) (I speake by experience, else I would not belieue it) many come to vs, and aske counsell of vs how to lye, and circumuent, supposing, that such things please vs. So he. So apt are naturall men to imitate the least errour in their Minister, when they could bee content, that his Doctrine also were such, as might feed them in


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:25199:94"/>
their humours. Or, when they see the Grapes in-folded within the Thornes, they will hardly aduenture the pricking of their hand, when seldome by such Thornes the heart is pricked with remorse vnto repentance to saluation, while prophane worldlings, and carnall professours, bearing an in-bred malice to the Word it selfe, are glad vpon the least occasion on the Ministers part, euen to absent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from his Ministrie, and Gods publicke Ordinances, yea contemning and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, specially if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters life be habitually scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, as in the examples of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.17.</note> So that of necessitie such must speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly breake off their course of sinne by repentance, and make


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:25199:94"/>
open demonstration thereof by their reformation, that by their example their sinfull people may also be drawne to repentance.</p>
               <p>Or, in case the Ministers offence is not of an habituall exorbitancie, but of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiduall act of infirmitie, heedlessely or negligently breaking forth from some corrupt disposition of his nature: his heart being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise vpright, and as true as Steele (as we say) as free from the purpose of sinning, as the cold Steele is from fire; but being strucke vpon by the Flint of some suddaine temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, may expresse some sparkles of in-bred corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which yet without the Tinder of consent, or at least without the Fuell of prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

or practise, quickly dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: And on the other side, the whole tenour of his life being a constant progresse in Christian duties, and those specially of his Calling, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually fighting with sinne, and corruption dwelling in his nature: Will not one vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall habit of grace so coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoyse, and counteruaile some particular act of inbred corruption, as that his people may reape much more good by the one, then hurt by the other? Seeing, a wise man will not wilfully goe throw himselfe downe headlong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his guide vnwarily hath slipped in a plaine way. And hee is a mad-man, that will desperatly goe cut his throat, because such a one hath fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly cut his finger. But (alas!)

we se, that a small skarre vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fairest face, proues the fowler blemish: and the least obliquity or crookednesse marres the straightest line: and the smallest mote will most trouble the tenderest, the clearest eye: and one small fly-corruption, the whole box of the purest oyntment: and one small errour is enough to disgrace and disparage all the most beautifull actions of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.<note place="margin">

But yet if in any other place he hath incurred an euill suspition that way, and that iustly vpon some aberration, all his good carriage among his owne people, what will it profit? Is not the world apt to take euery thing in the worst part, in euil, concluding substances vpon shadowes, and fruits of radicall iniquity, where she seeth but a leafe or blossome of corruption, sprouting forth beneath the new grafting of the old Crab-tree-stocke? and in good, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; esteeming the substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of holinesse but as shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes

What comfort then may hee hope for this way? seeing a false suspicion once rooted, is hardly remooued, but pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth for currant, as if the worst that could bee said were too true.

               <p>Againe, that Gods Minister in this case may find comfort in his Ministerie among his people, hee must obserue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther practise of <hi>Dauid,</hi> which is, to haue his heart establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Grace, and that, not onely in the assured pardon of his sinne, but also in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie of his conuersion from it, that hee may the more cheerfully apply himselfe to

before, when a Minister hath found peace with God in the pardon of his sinne, hee may with comfort of Conscience apply himselfe in his Ministry to bee an instrument of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting others vnto God. As Christ said to <hi>Peter, When thou art conuerted, strengthen thy brethren.</hi> As <hi>Dauid</hi> goes on, <hi>Deliuer me from blood-guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, O God, thou God of my Saluation, and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousnesse.

And <hi>Esay,</hi> being a man of pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lips, had no heart to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie to others, before the <hi>Seraphim</hi> had touched his lips


<pb n="157" facs="tcp:25199:101"/>
with a coale from the Altar, saying, <hi>Lo, this hath touched thy lips, and thine iniquitie is taken away, and thy sinne purged.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Esay</hi> now can say, <hi>Here I am, send me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Esa. 6.7.</note> So that a Ministers peace with God, giues him comfort and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to preach to others that grace and mercie, whereof himselfe hath had particular experience. As <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>For this cause I obtained mercie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.16.</note> 
                  <hi>that in me first, Iesus Christ might shew forth all long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for a patterne to them, which should hereafter belieue on him to life euerlasting.</hi> But on the contrarie, I see not with what confidence or courage a Minister can stand in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, and in the face of his Congregation, either to instruct others in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,


<pb n="158" facs="tcp:25199:102"/>
which himselfe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not, or to reproue them of sinne, whereof him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe repenteth not. Famous is that example of <hi>Origen,</hi>

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:25199:102"/>
and bitter weeping, and that so abundantly, that as a stream it carried the affections of the whole assembly with it to weepe for companie, and that out of a fellow-feeling of those compunctions of heart, which so stopped his mouth, and opened the flood-gates of repentance, for his late sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to the Idol, and for other his errours, whereinto he was said to fall, after that his fall. Such an insupportable burden is sinne vnrepented vpon a Ministers Conscience, that till by the mercie of God hee be well lightened of it, vneath he shall beare the Lords bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vnto the people. But vpon his humble repentance, being at peace with God, and hauing obtained the comfort of his Spirit, and the assistance


<pb n="160" facs="tcp:25199:103"/>
of his grace to settle him in the state of a good Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and of a holy life: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he becomes imboldened to preach of mercy to others, whereof himselfe hath so plentifully tasted, and wherby sinners may be conuerted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Minister as hee hath offended his Flocke any way iustly, he must labour to make them satisfaction. And this stand sin foure things especially: First, In dubbling his labour and diligence in the faithfull discharge of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, that what he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly lost by any kind of neglect, either in life, or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, hee may endeuour to regaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In labouring so much the more to set forth

will easily walke inordinatly, that is, as the Apostle applyeth it, not working in his Calling, or doing the worke of the Lord negligently: For if hee do, let him looke, after admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, to be auoyded of all his Brethren as a Heathen or Publican, as our Sauiour speakes.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:25199:110"/>
his owne afflicted Soule, and for which hee is like all his life long to wade in this vaile of miserie, through a sea of sorrows, and flood of teares: Then what may another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that walketh in an open scandalous course, without the least touch of remorse, much lesse signe of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Especially in such a Church, whose greatest care and vigilancie is to bee found without spot or wrinckle, since the Apostle saith, <hi>If any man obey not our word, note that man, and haue no companie with him, that he may be ashamed. Yet</hi> (oh that wee would note this Apostolicke caution well, and put it in better practise!) <hi>count him not as an enemie, but admonish him as a Brother.</hi> And yet (alas!) for many


<pb n="176" facs="tcp:25199:111"/>
seueere Censurers, where is one brotherly Admonisher? For all are ready to condemn, to contemne, when many times (if they knew all) they had more need to comfort their deiected and disconsolat Brother, if euer themselues tasted of the same bitter Cup of Spirituall discomforts.</p>
               <p>Another mitigation of his maladie may arise from the consideration of the perfect condition of these his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and that as others sinne, so (it is to bee hoped) their owne also in the first place, cannot but bee displeasing to themselues, and then the comfort may bee, that one time or other at last, they will looke more fauourably vpon him, be reconciled vnto him, take him into their bosome


<pb n="177" facs="tcp:25199:111"/>
againe, they cannot bee impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable at least rebuke him in the Spirit of meekenesse, as knowing that themselues also may be tempted. And thus let me be the obiect of contempt to my Brethren, while I may inioy the sight of the vnstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse of their perfections: and themselues without enuie honoured and admired of all. But yet (alas!) these comforts will not come home enough. To reioyce at the happy estate of Gods Church and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though it be a symptom and signe of true grace, and a qualitie proper to none, but to Gods elect Saints: Yet what comfort can it bee for a man, to reioyce at others well-fare, and in the meane time to bee pressed downe with the waight of his owne vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse?


<pb n="178" facs="tcp:25199:112"/>
Or how can he be comforted to see others in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that is himselfe compassed about with disgrace? Could the sight of <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s bosome any whit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort poore <hi>Diues,</hi> now in Hell torments, or not rather add fuell to those flames? Much lesse shall hee euer thinke to extenuate his owne sinne, and consequently mitigate his sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, by discouering or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitably thinking that there may be farre greater obliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in others, then hee can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily find to bee in himselfe. As though anothers Plague would asswage my Feuer: Or anothers Gangreue my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duuiae, or sore finger. Yea, on the contrarie, the least sinne becomes the more damnable, when it seekes a patronage, or


<pb n="179" facs="tcp:25199:112"/>
shaddow from some others Master-sinne. This is to looke vpon others sinnes with a Perspectiue glasse, turning that end outward, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth and multiplyeth the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, but the other towards a mans selfe, which contracteth and abateth it. Nor is it safe for a man so to compare or parallel himselfe with others, as looking onely on their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and slips, but not on their more masculine vertues and graces: And on the other side, reflecting vpon his owne moralities, perhaps not mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the like imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, at least in apparence, yet comming as farre short of the others perfections, and nobler parts, thereupon either to comfort himselfe, or to contemn them, in comparison

               <head>CHAP. XI. The sixt Conflict. With the Enemies of the truth.</head>
               <p>IT goes hard with the poore seruant of Christ, when hee hath giuen cause of offence to the enemies of the truth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be without, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church, open or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, profest Papists, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Protestants. For if the Angels in heauen reioyce at the conuersion of a sinner, surely the Angels of darkenes, and wicked persons, enemies of the truth, reioyce at the fal, or least slip of one that bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Christs Image. Yea it is meate and drinke vnto them. They do so hunger after this,


<pb n="247" facs="tcp:25199:147"/>
waiting for the halting of the godly man, that rather then faile, they will inuent how to fasten slanders, &amp; cast aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons euen vpon the most inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; so little need hath any of Gods children to be heedlesse of his conuersation, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his name as a prey to their teeth. And yet this hath bene the lot euen of the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest Champions, and holiest Saints of God <hi>Dauid</hi> smarted so much the more, because he had by his sinne caused the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of the Lord to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme. O how neere doth this goe to the heart of Gods child, when hee considereth, how instead of being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of vertue, to inuite the enemies of the truth to the loue of it, beholding it to shine in the professors of it: on the


<pb n="248" facs="tcp:25199:148"/>
contrary, hee causeth them to mis-deeme the truth it selfe, yea to blaspheme it, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to condemne al that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse it. For such is the malice of enuious men against the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent glory of the truth (the highest obiect of enuy) that the least miscarriage of one Professor preuailes more with them to condemne the whole communion of Saints mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant on earth, as hypocrites, and dissemblers, then the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted conuersation of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands is able to wipe off, or to possesse them with a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of their Profession. Yea and in stead of taking profit, and making vse of the enemies of the truth, among whom wee haply conuerse, while their vicinity or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood should make vs


<pb n="249" facs="tcp:25199:148"/>
more heedfull of our wayes, least we offend them (nothing being more disgracefull to a man, then to commit any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely act in the presence of his enemy, the Apostle admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, <hi>Walke wisely towards them that are without</hi>) wee on the otherside cause much hurt vnto them (not onely the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shame to our selues) by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming them in their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, prophannesse, idolatry, or superstition, which now they dare more confidently preferre euen before Gods pure religion it selfe, while their naturall morality, or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition may seeme in the least degree to outstrip our practicall diuinity. Much more then what a disgrace is it for a Protestant to run riot in the presence of Papists?


<pb n="250" facs="tcp:25199:149"/>
Not that Papists can shew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great holinesse of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by the holines of their liues, seeing they so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime vpon holinesse, in the professors of the truth, giuing it the nick-name of a new kind of I wot not what here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, as Puritanisme, or the like; so that they plainely disclaime holinesse in themselues: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath their religion it in it, for all their infused righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, to infuse any holines (<hi>Bellarmine</hi> making the san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitie of Doctrine, not of Life, to be that, which sheweth the Church of Rome to bee holy) into the professors of it; a thing confessed by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>

               <p>Nor speake wee of any ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard Protestants, who casting off all care and conscience of a Christian conuersation, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to their generall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, are willing rather to symbolize with Papists in their profanation of all holy


<pb n="253" facs="tcp:25199:150"/>
things, as the hallowing of the Lords day in all such Christian duties, as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, and so consequently run along with them vnto all excesse of riot, railing at those that run not with them; such Neutralls are neither good Fish nor Flesh; but we speake of such Protestants, as making conscience of their wayes, to walke worthy of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, if they chance to step be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the narrow path, and of humaine frailtie commit the least errour, so as euen the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist comes to take notice of it: It is enough to rayse a cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour not onely against the person in particular, but against the whole Profession, to make it odious (if possible) to all the world. Certainly, if any sober Protestant doe


<pb n="254" facs="tcp:25199:151"/>
but enter into a consideration hereof, he will be exceedingly wounded for the least offence giuen in this kind, either by himselfe, or by another.</p>
               <p>Nor doth the offence onely reach to enemies without, but it more neerely toucheth the Conscience for enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church. What an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation was it to <hi>Dauid</hi> (trow you) when hee heard how the verie drunkards, and debosht sons of Belial within the Church, made their Songs of him? It was grieuous to <hi>Iob</hi> to be the derision of those base brats, whose fathers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>Iob</hi> accounted not (for their vile conditions, not for their pouertie) worthy to bee set with the Dogges of his Flocke? But this might the more easily bee brooked, sith

not any iust offence in <hi>Iob,</hi> but his vertues, so formerly enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but now scorned, being couered ouer and defaced with outward calamities, made him to bee the obiect of contempt. But <hi>Dauid</hi>'s case was much more pittifull, when those drunken compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions at their vsuall Baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals made his sinne their song. Can an ingenuous, and noble Heauen-borne Spirit, euen without bursting, brooke such an indignitie? And yet not so much the shame, which himselfe sustaineth, as the blame which Religion bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for his sake, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate danger also, whereinto by occasion of his example such Coribantes precipitate themselues: is the thing, that

most of all troubleth his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spirit. What comfort then in such a case?</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. The Comfort; How in this Conflict the Soule may stay it selfe, and wind out of it.</head>
               <p>WHo would not here stand agast, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall'd, to consider into what a Maze of perplexities, and Sea of sorrowes, sinne, though but in some errour of our life, doth inwrap and ingulfe the poore child of God; still one waue following in the necke of another, like <hi>Iob</hi>'s messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and euerie one more grieuous then other? How is it possible, but the poore man should bee swallowed vp in the bottomlesse gulfe? But


<pb n="258" facs="tcp:25199:153"/>
loe, euen in his vtmost extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie there is a planke for him to saue him from drowning. First for the offence to the enemies without the Church. The wound that is deeper will require the longer tent, the longer time, the greater pains, the greater patience in curing of it. For first, this must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubble and renue his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Secondly, he must pray the more feruently for Gods enemies, for their conuersion to God. Thirdly, hee must expresse such fruits of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in his life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, that euen they that are without, may thereby bee brought within the Church. Fourthly, if he be a Minister, he must so much the more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in his Calling, and that not onely by preaching, but


<pb n="259" facs="tcp:25199:153"/>
otherwise also, if God haue giuen him abilitie and opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, that thereby they may bee brought to Christs Fold. And if by his labour hee can rescue but one Soule out of the Diuels paw, it will both comfort him for the present, and procure vnto him a more glorious reward hereafter. Fifthly, though all his labour and industry this way cannot preuaile to win any one of Gods enemies, yet his good purposes and endeauours shal not bee defrauded of Gods gratious acceptance, nor fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated of a mercifull recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. Sixthly, if the enemies of God remaine obstinate in their Idolatry and superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is not now (whatsoeuer their pretence bee) because of offence taken at him who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth


<pb n="260" facs="tcp:25199:154"/>
the truth, but because they are possest with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of obstinacie to affect fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and lyes, rather then the truth. For although through humaine weakenesse hee had giuen them cause of offence, to helpe to harden them in their Infidelitie: yet now vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the more cleare euidence of his repentance, confirmed by his constant reformation, they ought to bee reconciled to God by his example. For if they will wilfully and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously harden themselues in sin by others example of falling: then on the contrarie they ought wisely and willingly to abandon their sinfull estate by the patern of his rising again. Otherwise, they therefore lye not in their sin, because Gods child hath vnwarily sinned,


<pb n="261" facs="tcp:25199:154"/>
whom they haue seene to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent: but because their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall malice against the truth hath blinded their eyes, not to imbrace it. So that the Child of God going on in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of these foresaid duties, he shall find much comfort in his Conscience, and much peace in his Soule. In the last place, as it fared with <hi>Dauid,</hi> so it faring with any Saint of God in the like kind, to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods rod inflicted (as we noted before) not as an expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorie or vindicatorie punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for sinne, alreadie satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by, and pardoned for Christ, both for guilt and mulct, but as a profitable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, not onely to humble the Patient, but to warne and terrifie Gods verie enemies not to sinne, seeing God spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

No surely; this is so farre from giuing him any comfort at all, that it rather much exasperates his sorrow. For while carnall worldlings, out of an inbred antipathy to true Religion (at lest touching the life and power of it) speak euill thereof, and hate the beautie of it, which shining in her Sonnes, discouers th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:25199:156"/>
of Darkenesse so much the more; in all which they are left without excuse, being conuicted of their owne Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, while they hate good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for no other cause, but because it is good: But now when the practicioner and professour of goodnesse hath so exorbitated from the strait and strict path thereof, as hee fals vnder the Checke of such Mates, hee puts a weapon into their hands, not onely for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, whereby they wound his vprightnesse, but for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, to maintaine their owne sinne. Yea doth hee not put a Dart into their hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with through his sides, lying open, for neglect of strait guirding on his Armour, they wound the whole Band of his fellow-Souldiers? Oh,

what a wound is this to his Soule?</p>
               <p>Yet why should he, at least so much torment himselfe for this?

And are not all the Children of Truth, though Saints by calling, though washed, sanctified, iustified in the Name of the Lord Iesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God, yet full of the Dregges of Corruption re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining to bee purged out by daily prayer, repentance, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:25199:157"/>
Is there not still in such a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of sinne to be destroyed? Still a Law in the Members, still sinne dwelling in them? Why then should some one actuall errour in such persons bee made such a Monster, or vn-heard-of wonder, as to bring a scandall vpon the whole Profession, yea or vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Person himselfe offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, so farre forth, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count him as a Reprobate? As though sanctification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in an vtter abolition of sinne, branch and root, and not rather (for the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this life) in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the tyrannicall dominion of sinne; and a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conflict with the Reliques of it. For although all the truly regenerate bee Saints, translated from the state of


<pb n="268" facs="tcp:25199:158"/>
darkenesse to light: Yet they put not off the nature of men, yea of weake and sinfull men, while they carrie about with them this body of death. For alas, how should the old bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of our mortall bodies bee able to containe the pure new Wine of perfect holinesse (perfect I meane in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees) and not burst, and the Wine run out? How many, possessed but with a conceit and opinion of perfection in this life, haue lost euen that grace, which they seemed to haue? How should not then Gods child be quickly puffed vp and enamoured with the beautie of his graces, and so, as Satan to bee cast forth of Heauen like lightning, as Christ admonisheth his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.18. if he had


<pb n="269" facs="tcp:25199:158"/>
not some allay of corruption, or sinne to presse him downe, and humble him? Was not the Apostle exercised with a Thorne in the Flesh the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of Satan to buffet him, least hee should bee puffed vp with aboundance of Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Or how should Gods power bee magnified in our weakenesse, who said vnto him, <hi>My grace is sufficient for thee, My strength is made perfect through weakenesse?</hi> Or how else should wee <hi>worke out our saluation with feare and trembling,</hi> seeing <hi>it is God that worketh in vs both to will and to doe of his good pleasure?</hi> Or how shall God tread Satan vnder our feet shortly, if wee bee alreadie Conquerours? Or how shall wee presse hard toward the marke, if wee bee


<pb n="270" facs="tcp:25199:159"/>
alreadie perfect? Or how shall wee shake off the sinne that doth so easily beset vs, and euerie waight of humane frailtie, to run with patience the race that is set before vs, if Gods Saints here bee alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without sinne? Or how shall the Spirit fight against the Flesh, if the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie bee alreadie vanquished? Or what need haue wee of Gods mercie, that wee should daily pray, <hi>Forgiue vs our sins,</hi> if we did not euerie day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sinne? So that to grieue, that one offence in the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate should bee sufficient to scandalize Religion, and the profession of it, may serue to muzzle either Papists in their pride, or Carnall men in their ignorance, who may thinke, that either there is a perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on


<pb n="271" facs="tcp:25199:159"/>
of grace on Earth, or else holinesse beeing imperfect, there is no difference at all among men, but onely in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, some see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be better then others. So that all this might seeme to mitigate the Patients ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladie.</p>
               <p>But yet (alas!) all this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not giue him any solid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. For although there bee no perfection of degrees in holinesse here in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, yet a perfection of parts there is; and so of the parts, that Gods child must still bee growing on, and aspiring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the perfection of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Whereunto striuing, if by the way, in regard of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite incombrances outward, and no lesse infirmities with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, hee stumble or fall,


<pb n="272" facs="tcp:25199:160"/>
stagger, or stray, neuer so litle, hee is so much the more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with himselfe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected in spirit, by how much hee pursued after perfection with greater sincerity and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gernesse. And although it stand not with the state of grace to be without many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred corruptions still dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, but not raigning in the regenerate: Yet it is no small griefe of heart vnto him, to haue committed the least sin. But when his corruption breakes out into a blaine or bile of open offence and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall, oh what intollerable tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth seaze vpon his soule, as we see in <hi>Dauid</hi>! but no man can take an estimate of the waight of this burthen, but he that hath it vpon him.</p>
               <p>Therefore to conclude all,

and to wind our selues at length out of this Meander of a turn-sicke conscience: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides other meanes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort mentioned before, wee will here adde onely these two. First, that the Delinquent or Offendant giue such testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his continuall heart-griefe for his sinnes past, as that hee may euen driue the most carnall man into an asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, and to reflect vpon his owne great and many sins, thus resoluing with himselfe: if so be that one sinne, and that committed of weakenesse, not of purpose, casually, not of custome, cost a man so much sorrow and humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: then what repentance and sorrow is requisite for all my great and many sinnes? Now I see, that sin is not so slightly

to be regarded, as formerly I haue imagined. Thus by Gods grace may the wickedest man be brought to repentance for his euil life past, by beholding thy great humiliation for the least sinne. What a comfort then shall this bring vnto thy soule, when thou shalt bee an occasion of pulling an other out of the fire, by letting him see how grieuous the burning of soule and body in hell flames shall be, when but one sparke, casually lighting vpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The second meanes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort herein, is to possesse thy soule with a greater indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against the least sinne in

thy selfe, but with a greater compassion of others weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. Pardon others many things, but thy selfe nothing. For if the Apostles reason for spirituall compassion be forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as when hee saith, <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, if a man be ouertaken in a fault, ye which are spirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store such a one in the spirit of meekenesse</hi>; and the reason is added, <hi>Considering thy selfe, least thou also be tempted:</hi> then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The second
