         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Andrews</hi> Lord Mayor of the ſaid City of <hi>London,</hi> and the reſt of the Bench then and there ſitting. It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
unto the ſaid Court (by a Certificate from the Deputy, Common-Councel men, Church-Wardens, and
divers others Inhabitants of the Pariſh of <hi>Sepulchres</hi> without <hi>Newgate London,</hi> well known, and worthy of good cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit)
That on Munday the two and twentieth day of <hi>July,</hi> in the ſaid yeer of our Lord, One thouſand ſix hundred

near <hi>Holborne-Conduit</hi> in the Pariſh aforeſaid, which within foure houres, conſumed, and burnt downe to the ground
five and twenty dwelling Houſes; The Loſſe whereof, amounts to the Summe of Two Thouſand and five Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
pounds, as appeared upon a full and particular view and examination of many able and experienced Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
By the meanes of which ſad Accident Threeſcore Families are utterly impoveriſhed, and moſt of them in
extream Neceſſity and Miſery, and like to periſh for want, unleſſe God in mercy move the hearts of well-diſpoſed
people in compaſſion towards them; Beſides divers other Houſes there adjacent, which were partly burnt and ſpoyled to a very great dammage
and loſſe, and which are not herein valued, in regard the Owners thereof are able to beare the ſame: And the ſame things were likewiſe at the
ſaid Court teſtified by divers other perſons of good worth and quality then, and there preſent. <hi>For</hi> the furtherance of which pious and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable

to make a general Collection with the Cities and Counties hereafter mentioned. <hi>Know</hi> ye therefore, That Wee being willing that ſuch

Helpe, and Comfort of their diſtreſſed Brethren in this their great Neceſſity) <hi>Have,</hi> Given and Granted; And by theſe Letters Pattents,
doe Give and Grant unto the ſaid diſtreſſed Inhabitants, and to their Deputy and Deputies, the Bearer and Bearers hereof, full Power, Licence, and
Authority to ask, gather, receive and take the Alms and charitable Benevolence of all good and wel-diſpoſed people Inhabiting within the Cities

and declare the Tenor of theſe Letters Pattents, or the Copy, or Briefe hereof unto the people upon ſome Sabbath day after the ſame ſhall bee
