            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is well known to ſome in <hi>London</hi> and elſewhere, that theſe Papers were finiſhed for the Preſſe, before <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt. But the firſt breaking out in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetledneſs of affairs which enſued upon it, proved ſuch diſcouragements to all Engagings of this kinde, that <hi>Michaelmas</hi> was paſt, before the undertakers would adventure on it. And what diſtractions have ſince followed in the Publick Government (ſufficient to retard a work of greater conſequence) is unknown to none. But <hi>long looked for comes at laſt,</hi> as the ſaying is, though why it ſhould come out at all may be made a queſtion; And I ſhall alſo give the Reader ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that, but in ſo doing muſt make uſe of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what which was ſaid elſewhere.</p>
            <p>It was more then half againſt my will, and rather through the indiſcretion of others, then any forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my own, that I was drawn to ſhew my ſelf in theſe preſent Controverſies. But being unſeaſonably
<pb facs="tcp:130574:3"/>
brought upon the ſtage by Dr. <hi>Bernard,</hi> impertinently enough by Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and with more then ordinary Petulancy by the <hi>Man of Scorne;</hi> the Occaſion was laid hold on by ſome very able and diſcerning men, for preſſing me to ſearch into the Hiſtory of theſe diſputes, ſo far forth as the Church of <hi>England</hi> was concerned in them, and to make publick what I found upon that inquiry. To which requeſt I made ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at the preſent, as the conſideration of my many unfitneſſes for an employment of that nature, might ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt unto me. But coming to me from ſo many hands, that it could not fairly be denyed, I was prevailed with in the end, to apply my ſelf to the undertaking, as ſoon as I had diſpatched ſuch other buſineſſes as lay then up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I thought I might comply ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently with all expectations, by faſhioning ſome ſhort <hi>Animadverſions</hi> on the principal paſſages, relating to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which had been purloyned for the moſt part out of Mr. <hi>Prinnes</hi> book of <hi>Anti-arminianiſm,</hi> by a late <hi>Compiler.</hi> By which name the old Criticks and Grammarians, uſed to call thoſe men, who pilfering their materials out of other mens writings, did uſe to lay them cloſe together as their own, to avoid diſcovery. <note n="*" place="margin">

And he that would behold a <hi>Plagacy</hi> in his proper colours, may finde him painted to the life in the <hi>Appendix</hi> to Mr. <hi>Pierce</hi> his Vindication of the learned <hi>Grotius;</hi> to which for further ſatisfaction I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:130574:3"/>That preamble having led the way, and my other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes being over, I prepared my ſelf unto that ſearch, to which I was ſo earneſtly moved, and ſo affectionately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated. My helps were very few and weak, which might ſufficiently have deterred me from the undertaking. But a good cauſe will help to carry on it ſelf, and truth will finde the way to ſhine, though darkned for a time with the clouds of Errour; as the Sun breaking from an Eclips, doth appear more glorious, though a while obſcured; <hi>Delitere videtur ſol, non delitet,</hi> as in the like caſe the Father hath it. The Five diſputed Points which in theſe laſt times are Reproached by the name of <hi>Arminianiſme,</hi> had more or leſſe exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Church in all times and ages; eſpecially after the breaking out of the <hi>Pelagian Hereſies;</hi> when all the Niceties thereof were more thoroughly canvaſſed. Neither the piety and ſobriety of the Primity times, nor the authority of the Popes, nor the commanding ſpirit of <hi>Luther,</hi> nor the more powerful name of <hi>Calvin,</hi> have prevailed ſo far; but that the Church and every broken fragment of it hath found ſome ſubdiviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout theſe Debates. So that it can be no great wonder if the Church of <hi>England</hi> be divided alſo on the ſame occaſion; or that a Deviation ſhould be made from her publick Rules, as well as in all other Churches, and all former times.</p>
            <p>Which way the general vote had paſſed in the elder ages, hath been abundantly ſet forth by <hi>John Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rard Voſsius,</hi> in his <hi>Hiſtoria Pelagiana:</hi> But he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended not ſo low as theſe latter times, conceiving he had done enough in ſhewing to which of the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding parties, the general current of the Fathers did moſt encline. And if <hi>Turtullians</hi> rule be good, that
<pb facs="tcp:130574:4"/>
thoſe opinious have moſt truth which have moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, (<hi>id verum eſt quod primum,</hi> as his own words are) the truth muſt run moſt cleerly in that part of the Controverſie which hath leaſt in it of the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> or <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines. And ſo far I ſhall follow his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, or example rather, in the purſuit of that deſigne which I have before me. For though it be my principal purpoſe to ſearch into the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> yet I ſhall preface my Diſcourſe by laying down <hi>The Judgement</hi> of the reſt of the <hi>Weſtern Churches,</hi> before I come to that of our firſt Reformers. By means whereof it may be ſeen what guides they followed, or rather with what parties they concurred in judgement; ſince in thoſe times the Church was generally ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted about theſe diſputes, that with the whole the aggregate body of believers, there could be no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hoped for, no compliance poſſible.</p>
            <p>In the purſuance of this work I have exemplified ſo much of the Debates and Artifices in the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> as concerns theſe points, and may be parallel'd with the like proceedings, in the Synod of <hi>Dort:</hi> I have conſulted alſo tho <hi>Confeſsions,</hi> the <hi>Synodals,</hi> and other publick Monuments, and Records of the ſeveral parties, and ſo many of the beſt and moſt approved Authors of this Church of <hi>England,</hi> as either were within my power, or could be adviſed with at a further diſtance: One whole diſcourſe I have tranſcribed about <hi>Freewill,</hi> not obvious to be met withall in Shops or Libraries. The like I have done alſo with one whole Homily, though the book be eaſie to be found by thoſe that ſeek it, knowing full well how unwilling moſt Readers are to take more pains in turning over ſeveral books, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining all quotations which are brought before them,
<pb facs="tcp:130574:4"/>
then of neceſſity they muſt. Nor have I purpoſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed or ſubducted any thing conſiderable which may ſeem to make for the advantage of the oppoſite party: And have therefore brought in a diſcourſe of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrologiſt</hi> in favour of the <hi>Calvinian Doctrine.</hi> I have alſo given a juſt account of the firſt breaking out of the <hi>Predeſtinarians</hi> in Queen <hi>MARIES</hi> time, and of the ſtirs in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> in Queen <hi>ELIZABETHS;</hi> not pretermitting ſuch particulars as may be thought to make for them, in the courſe of this Narrative, even to the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the harſh expreſſions of King <hi>JAMES</hi> againſt <hi>Arminius.</hi> And therefore I may ſay in the words of <hi>Curtius, Plura equidem tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribo quam credo; nec enim affirmare aufuge ſum, quae dubito; nec ſubducere ſuſtinco quae accepi.</hi> I have related many things, which I cannot approve, though I have not let them paſſe without ſome cenſure; that ſo I may impoſe nothing on the Readers belief, without good grounds; nor defraud him of any thing conducible to his Information.</p>
            <p>I was not to be told how much my firſt engageing in this buſineſs might offend thoſe men who loved to countenance their extravagancy by the name of the <hi>Church,</hi> and what loud clamours they had raiſed againſt the moſt Reverend Dr. <hi>Whitgift,</hi> for encountring with <hi>T. C.</hi> in behalf of the Liturgy; againſt Dr. <hi>John Bridges</hi> Dean of <hi>Sarisbury,</hi> for ſtanding in defence of the ſacred Hirarchy; againſt the moſt learned Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> for croſſing <hi>Calvins</hi> new device about <hi>Chriſts deſcent;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Dr. <hi>Barce</hi> for oppoſing the <hi>Genevian</hi> Rigors in the points before us; againſt Mr. <hi>Richard Mountague</hi> for ſeparating the opinions of private men from the Churches Doctrins; and finally againſt the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouned

            <p>But I have been ſo long accuſtomed to the noiſe of this Rayling Rhetorick, that I am now no more troubled at it, then were the <hi>Catadupi</hi> at the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> or <hi>Socrates</hi> to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf derided and expoſed to ſcorn on the publick Theatre; Or could I be exaſperated to a Retaliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that ſaying of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> would recall me to my wonted temper; who being bitterly railed at by ſome of his Presbyters, retruned this Anſwer, <hi>Non Oportet me paria cum illis facere;</hi> that it becomes not me to anſwer them with the like revilings. And yet I cannot but take notice of a miſchievious project, for throwing a Ball of diſcord betwixt me and ſome friends of mine, Doctors in title and degree, and by the Libeller declared to be of <hi>my own perſwaſion,</hi> one of which is affirmed to ſay, <hi>That I was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Writer, and marred every thing which I med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with;</hi> and for the finding of this one I have
<pb facs="tcp:130574:5"/>
nothing but a blinde direction of <hi>Hiſt.</hi> in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; placed there of purpoſe, as it ſeemeth, to put me into a ſuſpition of all eminent perſons, whoſe names begin with thoſe two Letters.</p>
            <p>It is recorded in the Hiſtory of <hi>Amianus Marcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linus,</hi> that certain men informed the Emperour <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> by their Deviliſh Arts, that one whoſe name began with <hi>THEO</hi> ſhould ſucceed in the Empire. Which put the Jealous Prince into ſuch a generall diſtruſt of all whoſe Names had that beginning <hi>(Theodoret, Theodoſius, Theopulos, Theodulos, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore)</hi> that he cauſed many of them, though men of eminent worth, and moſt exemplary Loyalty, to be made the ſubjects of his fear and cruelty. And ſuch a Devilliſh Art is this of <hi>T. C.</hi> the younger (by which two Letters he affects to diſguiſe his name) to work me into a ſuſpition of ſome <hi>eminent perſons,</hi> and ſuch as muſt be alſo of my <hi>own perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</hi> But I have no ſuch jealouſies as <hi>Valence</hi> had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore ſhall create no trouble to my ſelf or others, upon that temptation. For firſt, I know the parties pointed to in thoſe two letters, to be the maſters of ſo much Candor and Ingenuity, that I am confident they rather would excuſe my infelici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or inſufficiencies (be they which they will) then bring me under the reproach of any ſuch cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as none of <hi>different judgement</hi> ever laid upon me. And ſecondly, ſo much they have deſcended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath themſelves, as of their own accord to certifie me both by Letters and Meſſages, how free they were from giving any ground to that baſe ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was contrived with ſo much malice and
<pb facs="tcp:130574:6"/>
deſign, to divide between us. And ſo <hi>Autorem Scelus repetet,</hi> the Calumny muſt be left at the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors dore, as the natural parent of it, till he can find out more diſtinctly upon whom to charge it. In the mean time I leave him to the mercy of the Laws, as a <hi>common Barrator,</hi>

            <p>But I have waſted too much time on this piece of impertinency, and might perhaps have better ſtudied my own fame, if I had took no notice of the Libell, or the Author either, but that to have been ſilent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, in ſo juſt a grievance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> might poſſibly be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for an argument of inſenſibility. For otherwiſe as there is nothing in the Author, but the ſtolne name of <hi>Theophilus Churchman,</hi> which deſcries my Pen, ſo there is nothing argumentative in the Pamphlet, either, which was not b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I return therefore to my <hi>Poſt,</hi> which if I can make good by Records and Evidence, (the fitteſt weapons for this Warfare) I ſhall not eaſily be forced from it by Reproach and Clamors, as were the Ancient <hi>Gauls</hi> from ſurpriſing the Capitol, by the noiſe and gagling of the Geeſe. But whether I have made it good or not, muſt be left to the Reader; to whom I hope it will appear, that <hi>Calviniſm</hi> was not the native and original Doctrin of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though in ſhort time it over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſpread a great part thereof, as <hi>Arrianiſm</hi> did the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches in the elder times; <hi>Ubi ingemuit orbis,</hi> as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> hath it, when the world groaned and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled under the calamity of that dangerous Hereſie.

And I hope too it will appear by this diſcourſe, that I am not yet ſo far reduced <hi>ad ſecundam pueritiam</hi> (as the <hi>Scorner</hi> taunts it) as that my <hi>venerable back and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks</hi> (pardon me for repeating ſuch unmannerly lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage) ſhould be <hi>intituled to the Rod</hi> of this proud <hi>Orbilius.</hi> Or if I be, I doubt not but that God Almighty, who <hi>ordaineth praiſe out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings,</hi> will raiſe ſome glory to his Name from that <hi>ſecond Childhood.</hi> To which great God, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mercies in Jeſus Chriſt, our common Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, I do moſt heartily recommend this Church, and all them that love it.</p>

                     <p>4. The Juſtified are bound by Faith to believe, they are in the number of the Predeſtinated.</p>
                     <p>5. The Juſtified cannot fall from Grace.</p>
                     <p>6. Thoſe that are called, and are not in the number of the Predeſtinated, do never receive Grace.</p>
                     <p>7. The Juſtified is bound to believe by Faith, that he ought to perſevere in Juſtice until the end.</p>
                     <p>8. The Juſtified is bound to believe for certain, that in caſe he fall from Grace, he ſhall receive it again.</p>
                     <p>II. In the examining the firſt of theſe Articles, the Opinions were divers. The moſt eſteemed Divines amongſt them thought it to be Catholick, the contrary Heretical; becauſe the good School Writers (<hi>S. Thomas, Scotus,</hi> and the reſt) do ſo think, that is, that God before the Creation, out of the Maſs of man-kind, hath elected by his only and meer mercy, ſome for Glory, for whom he hath prepared effectually the means to obtain it, which is called, to predeſtinate. That their number is certain and determined, neither can there any be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The others not Predeſtinated cannot complain, for that God hath prepared for them ſufficient aſsiſtance for this, though indeed none but the Elect ſhall be ſaved. For the moſt principal reaſon they alledged, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made <hi>Jacob</hi> a pattern of the Predeſtinated, and <hi>Eſau</hi> of the Reprobate, he produceth the Decree of God pronounced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:130574:25"/>
they were born, not for their Works, but for his own good pleaſure. To this they joyned the example of the ſame Apoſtle: That as the Potter of the ſame Lump of Clay, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth one Veſſel to honour, another to diſhonour; ſo God of the ſame Maſs of men, chooſeth and leaveth whom he liſteth: for proof whereof <hi>S. Paul</hi> bringeth the place where God faith to <hi>Moſes, I will ſhew mercy, on whom I will ſhew mercy, and I will ſhew pity, on whom I will ſhew pity.</hi> And the ſame Apoſtle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth; <hi>It is not of him that willeth, or of him that runneth, but of God who ſheweth mercy;</hi> adding after, that God <hi>ſheweth mercy, on whom he will, and hardneth whom he will.</hi> They ſayd further, That for this cauſe, the Councel of the Divine Predeſtination and Reprobation is called by the ſame Apoſtle, The height and depth of wiſdom, unſearchable and incomprehenſible. They added places of the other Epiſtles, where he ſayth, <hi>We have nothing but what we have received from God,</hi> that <hi>we are not able of our ſelves, ſo much as to think well:</hi> and where, in giving the cauſe, why ſome have revolted from the Faith, and ſome ſtand firm, he ſayd, it was becauſe <hi>the Foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, and hath this ſeal;</hi> the <hi>Lord knoweth who are his.</hi> They added divers paſſages of the Goſpel of <hi>S. John,</hi> and infinite Authorities of <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> becauſe the Saint wrote nothing in his old Age but in favour of this Doctrine.</p>
                     <p>III. But ſome others though of leſs eſteem, oppoſed this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, calling it hard, cruel, inhumane, horrible, impious, and that it ſhewed partiality in God, if, without any motive cauſe, he elected one, and rejected another; and unjuſt if he damned men for his own will, and not for their faults, and had created ſo great a multitude to condemn it. They ſayd, it deſtroyed Free-will, becauſe the Elect cannot finally do evil, nor the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate good: that it caſteth men into a gulph of deſperation, doubting that they be Reprobates; That it giveth occaſion to the wicked of bad thoughts, not caring for Pennance, but thinking if they be elected, they ſhall not periſh; if Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, it is in vain to do well, becauſe it will not help them. They confeſſed, that not only works, are not the cauſe of Gods election, becauſe that is before them, and eternal; but that neither Works foreſeen, can move God to Predeſtinate, who is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:130574:25"/>
willing for his infinite mercy, that all ſhould be ſaved, to this end prepareth ſufficient aſſiſtance for all, which every man having Free-will receiveth or refuſeth, as pleaſeth him: and God in his eternity foreſeeth thoſe who will receive his help, and uſe it to good, and thoſe who will refuſe; and rejecteth theſe, electeth and predeſtinateth thoſe: They added, That otherwiſe there was no cauſe why God in the Scriptures ſhould complain of ſinners; nor why he ſhould exhort all to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and converſion, if they have not ſufficient means to get them: that the ſufficient aſſiſtance invented by the others, is inſufficient, becauſe, in their opinion, it never had nor ſhall have any effect.</p>
                     <p>IV. The firſt Opinion as it is myſtical and hidden, keeping the minde humble, and relying on God, without any confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in it ſelf, knowing the deformity of ſin, and the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Divine Grace; ſo this ſecond was plauſible and popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, cheriſhing humane preſumption, and making a great ſhew; and it pleaſed more the preaching Fryers, then the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Divines. And the Council thought it probable, as conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to politick Reaſon: It was maintained by the Biſhop of <hi>Bitonto,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Salpi</hi> ſhewed himſelf very partial. The Defenders of this, uſing humane Reaſons, prevailed againſt the others, but coming to the teſtimonies of Scripture, they were manifeſtly overcome.</p>
                     <p>V. <hi>Calarinus,</hi> holding the ſame Opinion, to reſolve the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, which troubled them all, invented a <hi>middle way;</hi> That God of his goodneſs had elected ſome few, whom he will ſave abſolutely, to whom he hath prepared moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, effectual, and infallible means; the reſt he deſireth for his part they ſhould be ſaved; and to that end hath promiſed ſufficient means for all, leaving it to their choice to accept them and be ſaved, or refuſe them and be damned. Amongſt theſe there are ſome who receive them and are ſaved, though they be not of the number of the Elect; of which kinde there are very many. Other refuſing to co-operate with God, who wiſheth their ſalvation, are damned. The cauſe why the firſt are predeſtinated, is only the will of God: why the others are ſaved, is the acceptation, good uſe, and co-operation with the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:130574:26"/>
Divine aſſiſtance, foreſeen by God: why the laſt are reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is the foreſeeing of their perverſe will, in refuſing, or abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it. That <hi>S. John, S. Paul,</hi> and all the places of Scripture alledged by the other part, where all is given to God, and which do ſhew infallibility, are underſtood only of the firſt, who are particularly priviledged; and in other for whom the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way is left, the admonitions, exhortations, and general aſsiſtances are verified, unto which he that will give ear and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, is ſaved, &amp; he that wil not, periſheth by his own fault. Of theſe few who are priviledged above the common condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the number is determinate and certain with God, but not of thoſe who are ſaved by the common way, depend on hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane liberty, but only in regard of the fore-knowledge of the works of every one. <hi>Catarinus</hi> ſayd, He wondred at the ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of thoſe, who ſay, the number is certain and determined, and yet they add that others may be ſaved; which is as much as to ſay, that the number is certain, and yet it may be enlarged: and likewiſe of thoſe who ſay; That the Reprobates have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient aſsiſtance for ſalvation, though it be neceſſary for him that is ſaved to have a greater, which is to ſay, a ſufficient, unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.</p>
                     <p>VI. He added, that <hi>S. Auguſtines</hi> Opinion was not heard of before his time, and himſelf confeſſeth it cannot be found in the works of any, who wrote before him, neither did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alwaies think it true, but aſcribed the cauſe of Gods will to merits; ſaying, God taketh compaſsion on, and hardneth whom he liſteth. But that will of God cannot be unjuſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is cauſed by moſt ſecret merits; and that there is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of ſinners: ſome who though they be juſtified, deſerve juſtification. But after the heat of Diſputation againſt the <hi>Pelagians</hi> tranſported him to think, and ſpeak the contrary; yet when his opinion was heard, all the Catholicks were ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized, as <hi>S. Proſper</hi> wrote to him, and <hi>Genadius</hi> of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles,</hi> fifty years after in his judgment which he maketh of the famous Writers, ſayd, That it hapned to him according to the words of <hi>Solomon; That in much ſpeaking one cannot avoid ſin:</hi> and that by his fault exagitated by his Enemies, the queſtion was not then riſen, which might afterwards bring forth hereſie,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:130574:26"/>
whereby the good Father did intimate his fear of that which now appeareth; that is, that by that oppoſition ſome Sect and Diviſion might ariſe.</p>
                     <p>VII. The cenſure of the ſecond Article was divers, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the three related Opinions. <hi>Catarinus</hi> thought the firſt part true, in regard of the efficacy of the Divine Will, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe who were particularly favoured: But the ſecond falſe, concerning the ſufficiency of Gods Aſſiſtance unto all, and mans liberty in co-operating. Others aſcribing the cauſe of Predeſtination in all to humane conſent, condemned the whole Article in both parts. But thoſe that adhered unto <hi>S. Auguſtine,</hi> and the common opinion of the <hi>Theologans,</hi> did diſtinguiſh it, and ſayd, it was true in a compound ſenſe, but damnable in a divided: a ſubtilty which confounded the minds of the Prelates, and his own, though he did exemplifie it by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he that moveth cannot ſtand ſtill, it is true in a compound ſenſe, but is underſtood, while he moveth: but in a divided ſenſe it is falſe, that is, in another time. Yet it was not wel underſtood becauſe applying it to his purpoſe; It cannot be ſayd, that a man predeſtinated, can be damned, in a time when he is not predeſtinated, ſeeing he is alwaies ſo: and generally the divided ſenſe hath no place, where the accident is inſeparable from the ſubject. Therfore others thought to declare it better, ſaying, that God governeth and moveth every thing, according to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature, which in contingent things is free, &amp; ſuch, as that the act may conſiſt together with the power to the oppoſite; ſo that wth the act of predeſtination, the power to reprobation &amp; dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation doth ſtand. But this was worſe underſtood then the firſt.</p>
                     <p>VIII. The other Articles were cenſured with admirable concord. Concerning the third and ſixth, they ſayd, it hath alwaies been an opinion in the Church, that many receive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, and keep it for a time, who afterwards do loſe it, and in time are damned. Then was alledged the example of <hi>Saul, Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> one of the Twelve: a caſe more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then all, by theſe words of Chriſt to the Father; <hi>I have kept in thy name all that thou haſt given me, of which not one hath periſhed, but the ſon of Perdition.</hi> To theſe they added <hi>Nicholas</hi> one of the ſeven Deacons, and others, firſt commended in the Scriptures, and then blamed: and for a concluſion of all, the Fall of <hi>Luther.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:130574:27"/>Againſt the ſixth, they particularly conſidered, that Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would become impious deriſion; when thoſe that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and nothing is wanting on their ſide, are not admitted: that the Sacraments would not be effectual for them; all which things are abſurd. But for cenſure, firſt, the Authority of the Prophet was brought directly contrary in terms, where God ſayth, That if the <hi>Juſt ſhall abandon juſtice, and commit ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity I will not remember his works.</hi> The Example of <hi>David</hi> was added, who committed Murther and Adultry, of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen,</hi> and <hi>S. Peter,</hi> who denied Chriſt: They de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ided the folly of the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> for ſaying, the Juſt cannot fall from Grace, and yet ſinneth in every work. The two laſt were uniformly condemned of temerity, with exception of thoſe unto whom God hath given a ſpecial Revelation, as to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Diſciples, to whom it was revealed, that they were written in the Book of Heaven.</p>
                     <p>IX. Now becauſe the Doctrine of Predeſtination doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally<note place="margin">Hiſt. of the Councel, fol. 175.</note> preſuppoſe a Curſe from which man was to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: it will not be amiſs to lay down the Judgment of that Councel in the Article of Original ſin (which rendred man obnoxious to the dreadful curſe) together with the preparatory Debates, amongſt the Scool-men and Divines, which were there Aſſembled; touching the nature and tranſmitting of it from <hi>Adam</hi> unto his Poſterity, and from one man to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Concerning which it was declared by <hi>Catarinus,</hi> That as God made a <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all his Poſterity, when he made <hi>him Father of the faithful:</hi> So when he gave O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Righteouſneſs to <hi>Adam,</hi> and all man-kinde, he made him ſeal an Obligation in the name of all to keep it for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and them, obſerving the Commandment: which becauſe he trangreſſed, he loſt it, as well for others as himſelf, and incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the puniſhent alſo for them; the which as they are derived in every one, and to him as the cauſe to others, by vertue of the Covenant: ſo that the actual ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is <hi>actual</hi> ſin in him, and imputed to others in <hi>Original;</hi> for proof whereof he grounded himſelf upon this eſpecially, that a true and proper ſin muſt needs be a voluntary Act, and nothing can be volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, but that tranſgreſſion of <hi>Adam</hi> imputed unto all.

                        <hi>Paul</hi> ſaying, that all have ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that they have all committed the ſame ſin with him; he alledged for example, that <hi>S. Paul</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> affirmeth that <hi>Levi</hi> payd Tythe to <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> when he payd in his great Grandfather <hi>Abraham:</hi> by which reaſon it muſt be ſayd, that the Poſterity violated the Commandments of God when <hi>Adam</hi> did it: and that they were ſinners in him, as in him they received Righteouſneſs.</p>

THeſe Differences and Debates concerning Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, the poſſibility of Falling away from the Faith of Chriſt, and the nature of Original ſin: being thus paſſed over; I ſhall look back on thoſe Debates which were had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Fathers and Divines in the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Nature of Free-will, and the power thereof. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whereunto theſe Articles were collected out of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> to be diſcuſſed and cenſured, as they
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:130574:28"/>
found cauſe for it. Now the Articles were theſe that follow, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>1. God is the total cauſe of our works Good: and Evil, and the Adultry of <hi>David,</hi> the cruelty of <hi>Manlius,</hi> and the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Judas,</hi> are the works of God as well as the Vocation of <hi>Saul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. No man hath power to think well or ill, but all cometh from abſolute neceſſity, and in us is no Free-will, and to affirm it is a meer Fiction.</p>
                     <p>3. Free-will ſince the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> is loſt, and a thing only titular, and when one doth what is in his power he ſinneth mortally: yea, it is a thing fained, and a Title without reality.</p>
                     <p>4. Free-will is only in doing ill, and hath no power to do good.</p>
                     <p>5. Free-will moved by God, doth by no means co-operate, and followeth as an Inſtrument without life, or an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Creature.</p>
                     <p>6. That God correcteth thoſe only whom he will, though they will not ſpurn againſt it.</p>
                     <p>II. Upon the firſt Article they ſpake rather in a Tragical manner, then Theological; that the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrine was a frantick wiſdom: that mans Will as they make it is prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; that thoſe words, a thing of Title only, a Title without reality, are monſtruous: that the Opinion is impious and blaſphemous againſt God; that the Church hath condemned it againſt the <hi>Maniches, Priſcillianiſts,</hi> and laſtly againſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballardus,</hi> and <hi>Wickliff:</hi> and that it was a folly againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, every one proving in himſelf his own Liberty; that it deſerveth not confutation, but as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement and Experimental proofe, that <hi>Luther</hi>'s Scholars perceived the folly, and to moderate the Abſurdity, ſayd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that a man had liberty in External, Political, and Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical Actions, and in matters of Civil Juſtice, that, which every one but a Fool knoweth, to proceed from Councels and Election, but denied Liberty in matter of Divine Juſtice only.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:130574:29"/>III. <hi>Marinarus</hi> ſayd, That as it is fooliſh to ſay, no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Action is in our power, ſo it is no leſs abſurd to ſay, that every one is: every one finding by Experience, that he hath not his Affections in his power: that this is the ſenſe of the Schools, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſay, that we are not free in the firſt motions; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> freedom becauſe the Saints have, it is certain, that ſome free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is in them which is not in us. <hi>Catarinus</hi> according to his opinion, ſayd, That without Gods ſpecial aſſiſtance, a man cannot do a moral good; ſayd, there was no liberty in this, and therefore that the Fourth Article was not ſo eaſily to be condemned. <hi>Vega</hi> after he had ſpoken with ſuch Ambiguity, that he underſtood not himſelf, concluded that between the Divines and the Proteſtants, there was no difference in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For they concluding now that there is liberty in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical Juſtice, and not in Supernatural, in External works of the Law, not in external and ſpiritual; that is to ſay, preciſely with the Church, that one cannot do ſpiritual works belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Religion, without the aſſiſtance of God. And though he ſayd, all endeavour was to be uſed for compoſition; yet he was not gratefully heard: it ſeeming in ſome ſort a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, that any of the Differences might be reconciled; and they were wont to ſay, that this is a point of the <hi>Colloquies,</hi> a word abhorred, as if by that, the Laity had uſurped the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority which is proper to Councels.</p>
                     <p>IV. A great Diſputation aroſe upon them, Whether it be in mans power to believe, or not to believe? The <hi>Franciſcans</hi> following <hi>Sotus,</hi> did deny it; ſaying, That as Knowledge doth neceſſarily follow Demonſtrations, ſo Faith doth ariſe neceſſarily from perſwaſions; and that it is in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is a natural Agent, and is naturally moved by the Object. They alledged Experience, that no man can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what he will, but what ſeemeth true, adding, that no man would feel any diſpleaſure, if he could believe he had it not. The <hi>Dominicans</hi> ſayd, that nothing is more in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Will, then to believe, and by the determination and reſolution of the Will only, one may believe the number of the Stars is even.</p>

                        <hi>Soto</hi> did invent, becauſe he knew no other means to avoid them, that true Liberty is equivocal; for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is derived from the Noun <hi>Libertas,</hi> Freedom, or from the Verb <hi>Liberare,</hi> to ſet Free: that in the firſt ſenſe it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to neceſſity, in the ſecond to ſervitude; and that when <hi>S. Auguſtine</hi> ſayd, That Free-will was loſt, he would infer nothing elſe, but that it is made ſlave to Sin and Satan. This difference could not be underſtood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe a ſervant is not free, for that he cannot do his own Will, but is compelled to follow his Maſters: and by this opinion <hi>Luther</hi> could not be blamed for entituling a Book of <hi>SERVILWIL;</hi> many thought the Fourth Article abſurd, ſaying, That Liberty is underſtood to be a power to both the contraries: therefore that it could not be ſayd, to be a Liberty to Evil, if it were not alſo to Good: But they were made to acknowledge their Error, when they were told that the Saints and bleſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Angels in Heaven, are free to do good, and therefore that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> was no inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that ſome ſhould be free only to do Evil.</p>
                     <p>V. In the examining the fifth and ſixth Articles of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent which Free-will giveth to Divine Inſpiration, or preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace, the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> and <hi>Dominicans</hi> were of divers Opinions: The <hi>Franciſcans</hi> contended that the Will being able to prepare it ſelf, hath Liberty much more to accept or refuſe the divine Prevention when God giveth aſſiſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it uſeth the ſtrength of Nature. The <hi>Dominicans</hi> denied that the Works preceding the Vocation, are truly preparatory, and ever gave the firſt place to God. Notwithſtanding there was a contention between the <hi>Dominicans</hi> themſelves. For <hi>Soto</hi> defended, that although a man cannot obtain Grace, without the ſpecial preventing aſſiſtance of God, yet the Will may ever ſome way reſiſt and refuſe it; and when it doth receive it, it is becauſe it giveth aſſent, and doth will ſo: and if our aſſent were not required, there would be no cauſe why all ſhould not be converted. For according to the <hi>Apocalyps, God ſtandeth always at the Gate and knocketh:</hi> and it is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:130574:30"/>
a Saying of the Fathers, now made common, <hi>That God giveth Grace to every one that will have it;</hi> and the Scripture doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies require this conſent in us, and to ſay otherwiſe were to take away the Liberty of the Will, and to ſay, that God uſeth violence.</p>
                     <p>VI. Fryer <hi>Aloiſius Catanca</hi> ſayd to the contrary, That God worketh two ſorts of preventing Grace in the Minde, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of <hi>S. Thomas,</hi> the one ſufficient, the other effectual: To the firſt, the Will may conſent or reſiſt, but not to the ſecond, becauſe it implyeth contradiction, to ſay, that Efficacy can be reſiſted; for proof he alledged places of <hi>S. John,</hi> and very clear Expoſitions of <hi>S. Auguſtine:</hi> He anſwereth that it ariſeth hence, that all are not converted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all are not effectually prevented. That the fear of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing Free-will, is removed by <hi>S. Thomas,</hi> the things are violently moved by a contrary Cauſe, but never by their own: and God being the cauſe of the Will; to ſay it is moved by God, is to ſay, it is moved by it ſelf. And he condemned, yea, mocked the <hi>Lutherans</hi> manner of ſpeech; that the Will followeth as a dead and unreaſonable Creature: for being reaſonable by Nature, moved by its own Cauſe, which is God, it is moved as reaſonable, and followeth a reaſonable. And likewiſe that God conſenteth, though men will not, and ſpurn at him: For it is a contradiction that the Effect ſhould ſpurn againſt the Cauſe. That it may happen that God may effectually convert one, that before hath ſpurned, before ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prevention, but afterwards cannot becauſe a gentleneſs in the Will moved, muſt needs follow the Efficacy of the Divine Motion.</p>
                     <p>VII. <hi>Soto</hi> ſayd, That every Divine Inſpiration was onely ſufficient, and that, that whereunto Free-will hath aſſented, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth efficiency by that conſent, without which it is unef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; not by the defect of it ſelf, but of the man. The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion he defended very fearfully, becauſe it was oppoſed, that the diſtinction of the Reprobate from the Elect, would proceed from man, contrary to the perpetual Catholick ſenſe; that the Veſſels of Mercy are diſtinguiſhed by Grace, from the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:130574:30"/>
Veſſels of Wrath. That Gods Election would be for Works foreſeen, and not for his good Pleaſure. That the Doctrine of the Fathers in the <hi>Affrican,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Councels againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> hath publiſhed, that God maketh them to will, which is to ſay, that he maketh them conſent; therefore gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conſent to us, it ought to be attributed to the Divine Power; or elſe he that is ſaved would be no more obliged to God, then he that is damned, if God ſhould uſe them both alike.</p>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding all theſe Reaſons, the contrary Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion had the general Applauſe, though many confeſſed that the Reaſons of <hi>Catanca</hi> were not reſolved: and were diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that <hi>Soto</hi> did not ſpeak freely, but ſayd, that the Will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenteth in a certain manner; ſo that it may in a certain man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner reſiſt: as though there were a certain manner of mean, between this Affirmation and Negation. The free ſpeech of <hi>Catanca,</hi> and the other <hi>Dominicans</hi> did trouble them alſo, who knew not how to diſtinguiſh the Opinion, which attributeth Juſtification by conſent from the <hi>Pelagian;</hi> and therefore they counſelled to take heed of leaping beyond the Mark, by too great a deſire to condemn <hi>Luther:</hi> that Objection being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed above all, that by this means the Divine Election or Predeſtination would be for Works foreſeen, which no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine did admit.</p>
                     <p>VIII. The Ground thus layd, we ſhall proceed unto a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Judgment of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the five Articles diſputed afterwards with ſuch heat, betwixt the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants,</hi> and the <hi>contra Remonſtrants</hi> in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Church, ſo far forth as it may be gathered from the Decrees &amp; Canons of the Councel of <hi>Trent,</hi> and ſuch preparatory Diſcourſes as ſmoothed the way to the Concluſions which were made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. In order whereunto, it was adviſed by <hi>Marcus Viguerius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sinigagli,</hi> to ſeparate the Catholick Doctrine from the contrary, and to make two Decrees; in the one to make a continued Declaration and Confirmation of the Doctrine of the Churches, and in the other to condemn and <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize</hi>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:130574:31"/>
there appeared a greater difficulty, then they were aware of, in conquering wherof the Cardinal of <hi>Sancta Cruz</hi> (one of the Preſidents of the Councel) took incredible pains, avoiding as much as was poſſible to inſert any thing controverted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the School-men; and ſo handling thoſe that could not be omitted, as that every one might be contented. And to this end he obſerved in every Congregation, what was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked by any, and took it away, or corrected it as he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed; and he ſpake not only in the Congregations, but with every one in particular, was informed of all the doubts, and required their Opinions. He diverſified the matter with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Orders, changed ſometimes one part, ſometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, until he had reduced them unto the Order in which they now are, which generally pleaſed, and was approved by all. Nor did the Decrees thus drawn and ſetled, give leſs content at <hi>Rome</hi> then they did at <hi>Trent,</hi> for being tranſmitted to the Pope, and by him committed to the <hi>Fryers,</hi> and other learned men of the Court, to be conſulted of amongſt them, they found an univerſal approbation, becauſe every one might underſtand them in his own ſenſe: And being ſo approved of were ſent back to <hi>Trent,</hi> and there ſolemnly paſſed in a full Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on the thirteenth of <hi>January,</hi> 1647. according to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And yet it is to be obſerved, that though the Decrees were ſo drawn up, as to pleaſe all parties, eſpecially as to the giving of no diſtaſt to the <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> Fryers and their Adherenrs; yet it is eaſie to be ſeen, that they incline more favourably to the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> whoſe cauſe the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> have ſince wedded, and ſpeak more literally and Grammatically to the ſence of that party, then they do to the others: which ſayd, I ſhall preſent the Doctrine of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Trent,</hi> as to theſe controverted Points in this Order following.</p>

In which as he can finde no Countenance from any of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Writers, ſo he pretendeth not to any ground for it in the holy Scriptures. For whereas ſome objected on Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, <hi>De certis verbis non extare,</hi> That the Decree of <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, and conſequently the involving of his whole Poſterity in ſin and miſery, had no foundation in the expreſs words of Holy Writ, <note n="a" place="margin">Inſtitut. l. 3. c. 23.

                        <p>3. Conſequently that the Spirit of God and of Chriſt doth work in thoſe who are elected that way, or this, with ſuch a force of Grace that they cannot reſiſt it: and ſo that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, but that they muſt turn, believe, and thereupon neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be ſaved. But that this irreſiſtible grace and force be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to thoſe ſo elected, but not to Reprobates, to whom not only the irreſiſtible Grace is denied, but alſo grace neceſſary and ſufficient for Converſion, for faith, and for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is not afforded. To which Converſion and Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are called, invited, and freely ſollicited outwardly by the revealed Will of God, though notwithſtanding the inward force neceſſary to Faith and Converſion, is not beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them, according to the ſecret Will of God.</p>
                        <p>4.

They Object third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That this doctrine is inconſiſtent with the mercy of God, ſo highly ſignified in the Scriptures, in making him to take ſuch a ſmall and ſpeedy occaſion, to puniſh the greater part of men forever, and for one ſin once committed, to ſhut them<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 64.</note> up under an invincible neceſſity of ſin and damnation.

It is affirmed to be incompatible with the Juſtice of God, who is ſayd in Scripture to be <hi>Righteous in all his waies,</hi> according unto <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>meaſure,</hi> that the<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 65 &amp; p. 67.</note> far greateſt part of man-kinde ſhould be left remedileſly in a ſtate of damnation, for the ſin of their firſt Father only: that under pain of damnation, he ſhould require faith in Chriſt, of thoſe to whom he hath preciſely in his abſolute purpoſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied both a power to believe, and a Chriſt to believe in; or that he ſhould puniſh men for the omiſſion of an Act which is made impoſſible for them by his own decree, by which he purpoſed that they ſhould partake with <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſin, and be ſtript of all the ſupernatural power which they had in him before he fell. And fifthly, It is ſayd to be deſtructive of Gods ſincerity, in calling them to repentance, and to the knowledge of the faith in Jeſus Chriſt, that they may be ſaved<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 68.</note> to whom he doth not really intend the ſalvation offered, whereby they are conceived to make God ſo to deal with

                        <p>X. And finally it is alledged that this doctrine of the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſarians,</hi> is contrary to the ends by God propoſed, in the Word and Sacraments, to many of Gods excellent Gifts to the Sons of men, to all endeavours unto holineſs and godly living, which is ſayd to be much hindered by it, and tend to<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 91.</note> thoſe grounds of comfort, by which a Conſcience in diſtreſs ſhould be relieved. And thereupon it is concluded, that if it be a doctrine which diſcourageth Piety; if it maketh Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters (by its natural importment) to be negligent in their Preaching, Praying, and other Services, which are ordained of God for the eternal good of their people: if it maketh the people careleſs in hearing, reading, praying, inſtructing their Families, examining their Conſciences, faſting and mourning for their ſins, and all other godly Exerciſes; as they ſay it doth: it cannot be a true and a wholſome doctrine, as they ſay 'tis not.

To which beſides the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners from the Churches of their ſeveral Provinces, all the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Churches in <hi>Europe</hi> (thoſe of <hi>France</hi> excepted) ſent their Delegates alſo; ſome eminent Divines being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated by King <hi>James</hi> to attend alſo in the Synod: for the Realm of <hi>Britain.</hi> A Synod much like that of <hi>Trent,</hi> in the Motives to it; as alſo in the mannaging and conduct of it. For as neither of them was Aſſembled till the Sword was drawn, the terrour whereof was able to effect more then all other Arguments: ſo neither of them was concerned to confute, but condemn their Oppoſites.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, The Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> conſiſted for the moſt part of <hi>Italian</hi> Biſhops, ſome others being added for faſhion ſake; and that it might the better challenge the Name of <hi>General,</hi> as that of <hi>Dort,</hi> conſiſted for the moſt part of the Delegates of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, to whom the forein Divines were found inconſiderable. The Differences as great at <hi>Dort,</hi> as they were at <hi>Trent,</hi> and as much care taken to adulce the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented Parties (whoſe Judgments were incompatible with the ends of either) in the one as the other. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> Divines, together with one of thoſe which came from the <hi>Breme,</hi> maintained the univerſal Redemption of Mankinde by
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:130574:46"/>
the Death of Chriſt. But this by no means would be granted by the reſt of the Synod, eſpecially by thoſe of North-<hi>Holland,</hi> for fear of yeilding any thing to the <hi>Arminians;</hi> as <hi>Soto</hi> in the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> oppoſed ſome moderate Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, teaching the certainty of Salvation, becauſe they were too much in favour with the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrines. Firſt, The general body of the Synod not being able to avoid the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which the <hi>Supra-lapſarian</hi> way brought with it, were generally intent on the <hi>Sublapſarian:</hi> but on the other ſide, the Commiſſioners of the Churches of <hi>South-Holland,</hi> thought it not neceſſary to determine which were conſidered, man faln, or not faln, while he paſſed the Decrees of Election and Reprobation. But far more poſitive was <hi>Gomarus,</hi> one of the four Profeſſors of <hi>Leiden,</hi> who ſtood as ſtrongly to the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute irreſpective and irreverſible Decree, (excluſive of mans ſin, and our Saviours Sufferings) as he could have done for the Holy Trinity. And not being able to draw the reſt unto his Opinion, nor willing to conform to theirs, he delivered his own Judgment in writing apart by it ſelf, not joyning in ſubſcription with the reſt of his Brethren, for conformity ſake, as is accuſtomed in ſuch caſes. But <hi>Macorius</hi> one of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors in <hi>Frankar,</hi> in <hi>Weſt-Frizeland,</hi> went beyound them all, not only maintaining againſt <hi>Sibrandus Lubbertus,</hi> his fellow Collegiate in their open Synod; That God wills ſin, That he ordains ſin as it is ſin: and, That by no means he would have all men to be ſaved; but openly declaring, That if theſe Points were not maintained, they muſt forſake their chief Doctors who had ſo great a hand in the Reformation.</p>
                     <p>VII. Some other differences there were amongſt them, not reconcilable in this Synod; as namely, whether the Elect be loved out of Chriſt, or not: whether Chriſt were the cauſe and <hi>foundation of Election,</hi> or only the Head of the Elect; And many others of like nature. Nor were theſe Differences man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with ſuch ſobriety as became the gravity of the perſons, and weight of the buſineſs, but brake out many times into ſuch open heats and violences, as are not to be parallel'd in the like Aſſemblies; the <hi>Provincial</hi> Divines banding againſt the Foreiners, and the Foreiners falling foul upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:130574:46"/>
for ſo it hapned; that <hi>Martinius</hi> one of the Divines of <hi>Breme,</hi> a moderate and learned man, being deſired to ſpeak his minde in the Points laſt mentioned, ſignified to the Synod, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'That he made ſome ſcruple touching the Doctrine Paſſant,<note place="margin">In his Letters, p. 72.</note> about the manner of Chriſts being <hi>Fundamentum electionis,</hi> and that he thought Chriſt not only the Effector of our Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but alſo the Author and Procurer of it. <hi>Gomarus</hi> preſently as ſoon as <hi>Martinius</hi> had ſpoken, ſtarts up and tells the Synod, <hi>Ego hanc rem in me recipio,</hi> and therewithall caſts his Glove, and challenges <hi>Martinius</hi> with this Proverb, <hi>Ecce Rhodum, ecce Sullum,</hi> and required the Synod to grant them a Duel, adding, That he knew <hi>Martinius</hi> could ſay nothing in Refutation of that Doctrine.'</q> So my dear Friend Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> of <hi>Eaton</hi> relates the ſtory of this paſſage in a Letter to Sir <hi>Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Carleton,</hi> bearing date <hi>Jan.</hi> 25. 1618. according to the ſtyle of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and where he endeth, Dr. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canquall</hi> ſhall begin relating in his Letters to the ſayd Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, the ſtory of a greater Fray, between the ſayd <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> and <hi>Sibrandus Lubberius</hi> above mentioned, upon this occaſion. <hi>Martinius</hi> had affirmed God to be, <hi>Cauſa Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſica Converſionis;</hi> and for the truth thereof, appealed to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenius</hi> a great Philoſopher, being then preſent in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, who thereupon diſcourſed upon it out of <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Gomarus</hi> within few dayes after picks a new Quarrel with <hi>Martinius,</hi> and the reſt of the Divines of <hi>Breme,</hi> for running a more moderate courſe then the reſt of the Synod: many other of the Provincials ſeconding <hi>Gomarus</hi> in the Quarrel, and carrying themſelves ſo uncivilly in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; that <hi>Martinius</hi> was upon the Point of returning home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.

alledged; Firſt, That he had been at <hi>Goclenius</hi> his Lodging, conferring with him about that Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, whether God might be called <hi>Cauſa Phyſica</hi> of humane Actions, and delivered certain Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions pronounced by <hi>Goclenius,</hi> tending to the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative;</hi> for the truth of his relation he appealed to <hi>Goclenius</hi> there preſent, who testified that it was ſo: next <hi>Martinius</hi> had alledged a place out of <hi>Paraeus</hi> for the Affirmative in <hi>opere converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis. Sibrandus,</hi> read a great many places out of <hi>Paraeus</hi> tending to the contrary: and (no queſtion it being pleaded before) he entreateth ſome of the <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> (naming them all ſeverally) who were <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus</hi> his Colleagues, would speak what they did know of <hi>Paraeus</hi> his minde, concerning the ſayd Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: <hi>Scultetus</hi> beginneth with a ſet Speech, which he had writ lying before him; but ſuch a Speech it was, as I, and I think all the Exteri, were exceedingly grieved it ſhould have come from a man of ſo much worth: the ſumm of it was this, That he did know upon his own knowledge, that <hi>Paraeus</hi> did hold the contrary of that which had been faſly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered on him in the Synod, that he could not endure to hear his deareſt Colleague ſo much abuſed as he had been by ſome men in the Synod: Moreover he could not now diſſemble, the great grief he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:130574:48"/>
that ſome in the Synod, went about to trouble ſound Divinity with bringing in <hi>Tricas Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticas,</hi> ſuch as was to make God <hi>Cauſam Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam Converſionis</hi> (that was for <hi>Martinius</hi>) ſuch <hi>portenta vocabulorum,</hi> as <hi>determinare,</hi> and <hi>non determinare voluntatem:</hi> that ſome men durſt ſay, that there were ſome doubts in the Fourth Article, which <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf had not throughly ſatisfied, nor other Learned Reformed Doctors; that it was to be feared that they intended to bring in Jeſuits Divinity in the Reformed Churches, and to corrupt the Youth committed to their Charge, with a ſtrange kind of Divinity. This laſt Speech concerned D. <hi>Grotius. Scultetus</hi> delivered his minde in exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bitter and diſgraceful words, and repeated his bittereſt ſentences twice over: he having ended, <hi>Martinius</hi> with great modeſty anſwered, firſt, That he would read <hi>Paraeus</hi> his own words, which he did; next that for <hi>Sibrandus</hi> he wondred that he would now in publick bring theſe things up, ſince out of his love to Peace, that very day he had ſent his Colleague <hi>Grotius</hi> to <hi>Sibrandus,</hi> with a large explication in that ſenſe, in which he had delivered the Propoſition, with which explication <hi>Sibrandus</hi> himſelf had ſent him word he was fully ſatisfied, and ſo he made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that that buſineſs had been peaceably tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:130574:48"/>
all this while <hi>Grotius</hi> ſpake nothing; <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi> beginneth to go on in the Diſquiſition, but I think he delivered a Speech againſt the <hi>Bremenſes,</hi> which none but a mad man would have uttered. Firſt, Whereas <hi>Martinius</hi> had ſayd, that he did deſire the reſolution of this doubt, <hi>Qui Deus poſſit ab ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine cujus potentia eſt finita, fidem, quae eſt opus omnipotentiae, exigere:</hi> and that neither <hi>Calvin,</hi> nor any of the Divines, had yet plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough untyed the Knot: he replyed, firſt, That he that ſayd ſo was not <hi>Dignus qui ſolveret Calvino Corrigiam:</hi> and that for the doubt it ſelf, it was ſuch a ſilly one, that <hi>ipſi pueri in trivio,</hi> could <hi>ipſius ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionem decantare</hi> (at which Speech every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſmiled.) Moreover, whereas <hi>Martinius</hi> in his Anſwer to <hi>Scultetus,</hi> had not spoken one word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, but only this, That he was ſorry that one who had now been 25 years a Profeſſor of Divinity ſhould be thus uſed for uſing a School-term: <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi> very wiſely had a fling at the Two, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the Synod, that ſince ſome men thought to carry it away <hi>annorum numero,</hi> he himſelf had been a Profeſſor not only 25, but 35 years. Next he falleth upon <hi>Grotius,</hi> and biddeth the Synod take heed of theſe men that brought in the <hi>Monſtra &amp; Portenta vocabulorum,</hi> the Barbariſms of the Schools of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:130574:49"/>
Jeſuits, <hi>determinare, &amp; non determinare volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem,</hi> with many ſuch speeches delivered with ſuch ſparklings of his eyes, and fireceneſs of pronunciation, as every man wondred the Preſident did not cut him off, at laſt he cut off himſelf I think for want of breath; and the Preſident giveth <hi>Celeberrimo Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctori Gomaro,</hi> many thanks for that his Grave and accurate speech: the <hi>Exteri</hi> wondred at it; at laſt my Lord of <hi>Landaff,</hi> in Good faith, in a very grave ſhort ſpeech (for which, as for one of the leaſt, I am perſwaded he ever delivered, we and all the <hi>Exteri,</hi> thought he deſerved infinite Commendations:) he ſpake to the Preſident to this purpoſe, That this Synod called <hi>Diſquiſition,</hi> was inſtituted for Edification, not for any man to ſhew <hi>Studium Contentionis;</hi> and therefore did deſire him to look that the knot of Unity were not broken. In this his Lordſhips speech, he named no man, the laſt word was hardly out of my Lordſhips mouth, but furious <hi>Gomarus,</hi> knowing himſelf guilty, delivered this wiſe Speech; <hi>Reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſime D. Praeſul, non agendum eſt hic in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodo authoritate, ſed ratione.</hi> That it was free for him to speak in his own place, which no man muſt think to abridge him of by their Authority. My Lord replyed nothing; but the Preſident told my Lord, that <hi>Celeberrimus D. Gom.</hi> had ſayd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:130574:49"/>
againſt mens Perſons, but their Opinions, and therefore that he had ſayd nothing worthy of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion: This gave every man juſt occaſion to think the Preſident was of the Plot. <hi>Martimus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Speech of <hi>Gomarus</hi> ſayd nothing, but that he was ſorry that he ſhould have this Reward for his far Journey: The Diſquiſition went on to <hi>Thyſius,</hi> who very diſcreetly told the Synod, he was ſorry <hi>Martinius</hi> ſhould be ſo exagitated for a speech, which according to <hi>Martinius</hi> his explication was true. Juſt as <hi>Thyſius</hi> was thus ſpeaking, <hi>Goma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and <hi>Sibrandus</hi> who ſate next him, pulled him by the Sleeve, talked to him in a confuſed angry noiſe, in the hearing and ſeeing of all the Synod, chiding him that he would ſay ſo: afterwards <hi>Thyſius</hi> with great moderation, deſired <hi>Martinius</hi> to give him ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of one or two doubtful Sentences he had delivered; which <hi>Martinius,</hi> thanking him for his Courteſie, fully did. The Preſident was certainly in this Plot againſt <hi>Martinius,</hi> for at the ſame time he read out of a Paper publickly, a note of all the hard Speeches <hi>Martinius</hi> had uſed. All this while <hi>D. Grotius</hi> his patience was admired by all men, who being ſo groſly abuſed and diſgraced, could get leave of his affections to hold his peace.</p>

                     <p>II. Firſt then it is objected, that this Doctrine is deſtructive of Gods Free Grace, reviving the old <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſies, ſo long ſince condemned. This is preſs'd by <hi>Boyerman,</hi> in his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations<note place="margin">Boyerman, Anro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Grotii Pietat.</note> on the book of <hi>Grotius,</hi> called <hi>Pietas Ordinum,</hi> &amp;c. where he brings in <hi>Pareus,</hi> charging them, with having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>E Schola Caeleſtii &amp; Pelagii,</hi> from no other School, then that of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and <hi>Caeleſtius,</hi> thoſe accurſed Hereticks. <hi>Thycius</hi> another of the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants,</hi> but ſomewhat more moderate then the reſt in this particular, conceives their Doctrine to incline rather to <hi>Semi-Pelagianiſme, Et aut candem eſſe, aut non multo diverſam,</hi> and either to be the very ſame, or not much different. But the authority of King <hi>James</hi>
                        <note place="margin">* <hi>Declar. againſt</hi> Vorſtius</note> was of greateſt weight, who in his heats againſt <hi>Vorſtius,</hi> calls them the Enemies of Gods grace, Atheiſticall Sectaries, and more particularly, the <hi>Enemy</hi> of God <hi>Arminius,</hi> as the King once called him. To which Objection it is anſwered, that whatſoever <hi>Pareus</hi> and the reſt might pleaſe to call them, they had but little reaſon for it; the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as honourably of the Grace of God as any other what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. And this they prove, by comparing the firſt branch of the Fourth Article, with that Golden ſaying of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> viz. <hi>Sine gratia Dei praeveniente ut velimus, &amp; ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quente ne fruſtra velimus, ad pietatis opera nil valemus;</hi> that is to ſay, that we may will the things which are good, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:130574:53"/>
following or <hi>aſſiſting,</hi> that we do not will them to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we are not able to do any thing in the works of piety. And by comparing the ſaid Clauſe with St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> words, it cannot eaſily be diſcerned, why the one party ſhould be branded for the <hi>Enemies of the Grace of God,</hi> while the other is honoured as the chief Patron, and Defender of it. It can not be denyed, but that they aſcribe ſomewhat more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o the will of man, then ſome of the rigid <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinians</hi> doe, who will have a man drawn forcibly, and <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtably<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi> with the cords of Grace, <hi>velut in animatum quiddam,</hi> like a ſenſeleſſe ſtock, without contributing any thing to his own ſalvation. But then it muſt be granted alſo, that they aſcribe no more unto it, then what may ſtand both with the Grace and Juſtice of Almighty God, according to that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſaying of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> viz. <hi>Si non eſt gratia Dei quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do ſalvat mundum? Si non eſt liberum arbitrium, quomodo ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat mundum?</hi> Were it not for the Grace of God, no man could be ſaved, and were there not a freedome of will in man, no man with juſtice could be condemned.</p>
                     <p>III. And as for the Reproachfull words which King <hi>James</hi> is noted to have ſpoken of them, it hath been ſaid (with all due reverence to the Majeſty of ſo great a <hi>Prince</hi>) that he was then tranſported with prejudice or particular Intereſſe; and therefore that there lay an Appeal, (as once to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi>) from the King being not then well informed, to the ſame King, whenſoever he ſhould be better informed. Touching their proceedings, it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, 1. That he had his Education in the Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where all the Heterodoxies of <hi>Calvin</hi> were received as Goſpel, and therefore could not ſo ſuddenly caſt off thoſe opinions, which he ſuckt in as it were with his Mothers Milk. 2. He was much governed at that time by Dr. <hi>Mountague,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and Dean of his Majeſties Chappell Royall, who having been a great Stickler in the Predeſtinarian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies, when he lived in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> thought it his beſt way, to beat down all ſuch Opinions by Kingly Authority, which he could not over-bear by the ſtrength of Arguments. And thirdly, that K. <hi>James</hi> had then a turn to ſerve for the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:130574:54"/>
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> of which more anon, which turn being ſerved, and <hi>Mountague</hi> dying not long after, his ears lay open to ſuch further informations as were offered to him, which drew him to a better liking both of the Men and their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions then he had formerly entertained of either of them.</p>
                     <p>IV. It is objected ſecondly, that theſe Doctrines ſymbolize ſo much with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they ſerve only for a Bridge for <hi>Popery</hi> to paſſe over, into any Church, into which they can obtain admittance. This Calumny firſt laid upon them in a Declaration of the States Generall, againſt <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevelt</hi> before remembred; wherein they charge him with a deſign of confederating with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to change the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of thoſe Countreys, and countenancing to that end the <hi>Arminian</hi> party, as his fitteſt Inſtruments; which clamor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt raiſed in <hi>Holland,</hi> was afterwards much cheriſhed, and made uſe of, by the <hi>Puritan,</hi> or <hi>Calvinian</hi> party amongſt us in <hi>England.</hi> By one of which it is alleadged, that Mr. <hi>Pym</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Juſtif. of the Fathers, &amp;c.</hi> p.</note> being to make a report to the Houſe of Commons, <hi>An.</hi> 1626. touching the Books of <hi>Richard Mountague,</hi> after Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> affirmed expreſſely, that <hi>the whole ſcope of his Booke was to diſcourage the well-affected in Religion, and as much as in him lay, to reconcile them unto Popery.</hi> He gives us ſecondly, a Fragment of a ſcattered Paper, pretended to be written to the Rector of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Colledge in <hi>Bruxells;</hi> in which, the Writer lets him know, that they had ſtrongly fortified their Faction here in <hi>England,</hi> by planting <hi>the Soveraign Drug Arminianiſme, which he hoped would purge the Proteſtants from their Hereſie.</hi> Thirdly, he backs this Paper with a Clauſe in the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> of the Houſe of Commons, 1628. where it is ſaid <hi>that the hearts of his Majeſties Subjects</hi> were perplexed in <hi>beholding the daily growth and ſpreading of the Faction of Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſme, that being, as his Majeſty well knew,</hi> (ſo they ſay at leaſt <hi>but a cunning way to bring in Popery.</hi> To all which, being but the ſame words out of divers mouths, it is anſwered, firſt, That the points which are now debated between the <hi>Calvini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and the old Proteſtants in <hi>England;</hi> between the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants,</hi> and the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants</hi> in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches; and finally between the <hi>rigid</hi> and <hi>moderate Lutherans</hi> in the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:130574:54"/>
upper <hi>Germany,</hi> have been as fiercely agitated, between the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> and the <hi>Dominicans</hi> in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> The old <hi>Engliſh Proteſtants,</hi> the <hi>Remonſtrants,</hi> and the <hi>moderate Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans,</hi> agreeing in theſe points with the <hi>Franciſcans;</hi> as the <hi>Engliſh Calviniſts,</hi> the <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants,</hi> and the <hi>rigid Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> do with the <hi>Dominicans:</hi> So that there is a compliance on all ſides with one of the ſaid two differing parties in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And therefore why a generall complyance in theſe poynts with the Fryers of St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> the principall ſticklers &amp; promoters of that <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> ſhould not be thought as ready a way to bring in <hi>Popery,</hi> as any ſuch complyance with the Fryers of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> he muſt be a very wiſe man indeed which can give the reaſon. Secondly, it is anſwered, that the <hi>Melanctonian</hi> or moderate <hi>Lutherans</hi> which make up infinitely the greateſt part of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, agree in theſe points with the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> or <hi>Franciſcan Fryers,</hi> and yet are ſtill as far from relapſing to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as when they made the firſt ſeparation from it. And therefore thirdly, that if <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſme,</hi> as they call it, be ſo ready a Bridge for paſſing over to Popery, it would be very well worth the knowing, how and by what means it ſhould come to paſſe, that ſo few of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants</hi> in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces, and none of thoſe whom they call <hi>Arminians</hi> in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould in ſo long a time paſs over that Bridge, notwithſtanding all the Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of want and ſcorn, which were put upon the one, and have been ſince multiplyed upon the other.</p>
                     <p>V. In the next place, it is objected, that the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrines, naturally incline a man to the ſin of pride, in attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Juſtiſ. of the Fathers, &amp;c.</hi> p. 34.</note> ſo much to the power of his own will, &amp; ſo little to the Grace of God, in chooſing both the means, and working out of the end of his own ſalvation. And for the proof hereof, a paſſage is alleadged out of the Hiſtory of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> that the firſt opinion, (that is to ſay, the Doctrin of Predeſtination, according to the opinion of the <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryers) <hi>as it is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and myſticall, keeping the minde humble, and relying on God, without any confidence in it ſelf knowing the deformity of Sin, and the excellency of Divine Grace;</hi> ſo the Second (being that maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Franciſcans) was plauſible and popular, and cheriſhed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane preſumption,</hi> &amp;c. The whole paſſage we have had before in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:130574:55"/>
the Second Chapter, Num. 4. but we ſhall anſwer to no more of it then the former Clauſe. Concerning which, it may be ſaid, that though Father <hi>Paul</hi> the Author of the Hiſtory <hi>hath filled the Chriſtian</hi> World with admiration, yet it is obvious to the eye of any diſcerning Reader, that in many places he ſavoureth not ſo much of the <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> as he doth of the Party; and that being carryed by the Intereſt of his Native Countrey, (which was the <hi>Signory</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi>) he ſeldome ſpeaks favourably of the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and their adherents, amongſt which the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> in theſe poynts are to be accounted. Secondly, that either Father <hi>Paul</hi> did miſtake himſelf, or elſe that his Tranſlator hath miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his meaning, in making the Second Opinion to be more <hi>pleaſing to the</hi> Preaching <hi>Fryers, then the underſtanding Divines;</hi> the name of <hi>Preaching Fryers,</hi> being ſo appropriated in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpeech to thoſe of the <hi>Dominican</hi> Order, that it is never applyed unto any other. And Thirdly, that the Authority of Father <hi>Paul</hi> is no otherwiſe to be embraced in Doctrinall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (what credit ſoever may be given to him in point of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) then as it is ſeconded by Reaſon. And certainly, if we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by the rule of Reaſon, that Doctrine muſt needs more <hi>che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh humane preſumption,</hi> which puffeth men up with the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Election, the infallibility of aſſiſting and perſiſting Grace, &amp; the impoſſibility of falling from the attaining of that ſalvation which they have promiſed to themſelves; then that which leaves theſe poynts uncertain, which puts a man to the continuall neceſſity of calling on God, and <hi>working</hi> out the way unto his <hi>ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> He that is once poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with this perſwaſion, that all the ſins which he can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly commit, were they as many as have been committed by all Mankinde, ſince the beginning of the World, are not able to fruſtrate his Election, or ſeparate him from the love and favour of Almighty God; will be too apt to ſwell with <hi>Phariſaicall</hi> pride, and deſpiſe all other men as <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Publicans;</hi> when ſuch poor <hi>Publicans as have their minds humble and relying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And finally it is objected, (but the Objection rather doth concern the men, then the Doctrine) that the <hi>Arminians are a Faction, a turbulent, ſeditious Faction,</hi> ſo found in the United Provinces, from their very firſt ſpawning; not to be ſuffered by any <hi>Reaſon of State</hi> in a Common-wealth.

                     <p>VII.

Which Diviſion in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Provinces, that King conſidered as a matter of moſt dangerous conſequence, and utterly deſtructive of that peace, unity and concord, which was to be the greateſt preſervation of the <hi>States <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited;</hi> on whoſe tranquillity and power, he placed a great part of the peace and happineſs of his own Dominions. Upon which reaſon, he exhorrs them in the ſaid Declaration, <hi>to take heed of ſuch infected perſons; their own Countrey-men being already divided into</hi> Factions, <hi>upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was a matter</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>ſo oppoſite to unity (which was indeed the only prop and ſafety of their State, next under God) as of neceſſity it muſt by little and little bring them to utter ruine, if juſtly and in time they did not provide againſt it.</hi> So that K. <hi>James</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the preſent breach, as tending to the <hi>utter ruine</hi> of thoſe States, and more particularly of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> his moſt dear Allye; he thought it no ſmall piece of <hi>King-craft,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute toward the ſuppreſſion of the weaker party; not only by blaſting them in the ſaid Declaration, with reproachfull names, but ſending ſuch Divines to the Aſſembly at <hi>Dort,</hi> as he was ſure would be ſufficiently active in their condemnation.</p>

then the bare word of Mr. <hi>Hickman,</hi> before it can deſerve an anſwer; the ſpeech being ſo <hi>Hyperbolicall</hi> (not to call it worſe) that it can hardly be accounted for a flower of Rhetorick.

And for the laſt four years, (for it held no longer) their greateſt trouble was to finde out a way to forfeit all their old and Native Priviledges in the dea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>h of <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> for maintenance whereof they had firſt took up Arms againſt the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> In all which time, no blood at all was drawn by the Sword of War, and but the blood of 5 or 6 men only, by the Sword of Juſtice, admitting <hi>Barnevelts</hi> for one: Whereas their warres with <hi>Spain</hi> had laſted above thrice that time, to the ſacking of many of their Cities, the loſs of at leaſt 100000. of their own lives, and the expenſe of many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of Treaſure. And as for <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> if he had committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Treaſon againſt his Countrey, by the Laws of the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey he was to be tryed. Contrary whereunto, the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> having got him into his power, put him over to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by certain Delegates, commiſſionated by the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, who by the Laws of the Union, can pretend unto no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over the Life and Limb of the meaneſt ſubject. Finally, for the conſpiring of <hi>Barnevelts</hi> Children, it concerns only them whoſe deſign it was. Who to revenge his death, ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily and unjuſtly contrived, and (as they thought) ſo undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, and againſt their Laws, might fall upon ſome deſperate Councels, and moſt unjuſtifiable courſes in purſuance of it. But what makes this to the <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> party? Or doth evince them for a <hi>turbulent and ſeditious Faction,</hi> not to be ſuffered by any <hi>Reaſon of State</hi> in a well-ordered Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. <hi>Barnevelts</hi> Kindred might be faulty, the <hi>Arminians</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, or the <hi>Arminians</hi> faulty, in their practiſe againſt the life of the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> under and by whom they had ſuffered ſo many oppreſſions; without involving thoſe in their Crimes and Treaſons, who hold the ſame Opinion with them in their Neighbouring Churches.</p>
                     <p>IX. The reaſon is, becauſe there is nothing in the Doctrine of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> (as it relates to the Five points in difference)
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:130574:57"/>
which can diſpoſe the Profeſſors of it to any ſuch practiſes. And therefore if the <hi>Arminians</hi> ſhould have proved as <hi>turbulent</hi> and <hi>ſeditious</hi> as their enemies made them, yet we were not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it to them, as they were <hi>Arminians,</hi> that is to ſay, as men following the <hi>Melanctonian</hi> way, of Predeſtination, and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thoſe points from the reſt of the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> but as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated, and provoked, and forced to caſt themſelves upon deſperate courſes, <hi>Quae libertatis arma dat ipſe dolor,</hi> in the Poets language. But ſo ſome ſay, it is not with the Doctrine of the other party by which mens actions are ſo ordered &amp; predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the eternall will of God, even to the taking up of a ſtraw, as before was ſaid, <hi>ut nec plus boni nec minus mali,</hi> that it is neither in their power, to do more good, or commit leſs evil then they do. And then according to that Doctrine, all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Murders and Seditions, are to be excuſed, as unavoydable in them, who commit the ſame, becauſe it is not in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er not to be guilty of thoſe Treaſons or Seditions which the fire and fury of the Sect ſhall inflame them with. And then to what end ſhould Princes make Laws, or ſpend their whole endeavors in preſerving the publick Peace, when notwithſtanding all their cares, and travails to prevent the miſchief, things could no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe ſucceed, then as they have been predetermined by the will of God. And therefore the beſt way would be, (<hi>Sinere res vadere quo vult</hi> (in the Latin of an old <hi>Spaniſh Monke</hi>) to let all matters go as they will, ſince we cannot make them go as we would; according to that counſell of the good old Poet.</p>

                     <p>4. Which ground thus laid, we will proceed unto the Doctrine of Predeſtination, according to the ſenſe and meaning of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> which teacheth us (according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral current of the ancient Authors before <hi>Augustines</hi> time) that God from all Eternity intending to demonſtrate his power and goodneſs, deſigned the Creation of the World, the making <hi>of man after his own image,</hi> and leaving him ſo made, in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect liberty to do or not to do what he was commanded, and that fore-knowing from all Eternity, the man abuſing this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, would plung himſelf and his poſterity into a gulf of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; he graciouſly reſolved to provide them ſuch a Saviour, who ſhould redeem them from their ſins, to elect all thoſe to life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal who laid hold upon him, leaving the reſt in the ſame ſtate in which he found them for their incredulity. And this I take to be the method of <hi>Election</hi> unto life Eternal, through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord, according to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> For although there be neither <hi>prius</hi> nor <hi>poſterius</hi> in the will of God, who ſees all things at once together, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth at the firſt ſight without more delay; yet to apply his acts unto our capacitie, as were the acts of God in their right <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,</hi> ſo were they primitively in his <hi>intention:</hi> But <hi>Creation</hi>

do firſt confeſs that he ſtands accuſed by thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for bringing in Fatal Neceſſity, and making God the Author of ſin; and then conclude, that therefore it may be made a probable gueſs, that there was no diſagreement between him and <hi>Calvin:</hi> The cauſe of which Argument ſtands thus, That there being an agreement in theſe points betwixt <hi>Wicklif</hi> and <hi>Calvin;</hi> and the Reformers of our Church embracing the Doctrines of <hi>Wicklif;</hi> therefore they muſt embrace the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo. But firſt, it cannot be made good that our Reformers embraced the Doctrines of <hi>Wicklif,</hi> or had any eye upon the man; who though he held many points againſt thoſe of <hi>Rom,</hi> yet had his field more <hi>tares</hi> then wheat; his books more Hetrodoxies, then ſound Catholick Doctrine. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, admitting this Argument to be of any force in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, it will as warrantably ſerve for all the Sects and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies which now ſwarm amongſt us, as well as for that of <hi>Calvin; Wicklif</hi> affording them the grounds of their ſeveral dotages, though poſſibly they are not ſo well ſtudied in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments: For they who conſult the works of <hi>Thomas Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſis,</hi> or the <hi>Hiſtoria Wicklifiana,</hi> writ by <hi>Hartsfield,</hi> will tell us that <hi>Wicklif,</hi> amongſt many other errours, maintained theſe that follow: 1. <hi>That the Sacrament of the Altar is nothing elſe but a piece of Bread. 2.

                     <p>2. If then the queſtion ſhould be asked (as perhaps it may) On whom, or on whoſe judgement, the firſt Reformers moſt relied in the weighty buſineſs? I anſwer negatively, firſt, That they had no reſpect of <hi>Calvin,</hi> no more than to the judgement of <hi>Wicklif, Tyndall, Barns,</hi> or <hi>Frith,</hi> whoſe offered aſſiſtance they refuſed when they went about it; of which he ſenſibly complained unto ſome of his friends, as appears by one of his Epiſtles. I anſwer next affirmatively in the words of an Act of Parliament, 2. &amp; 3. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. where it is ſaid, <hi>That they had an eye in the firſt place to the mo pure and ſincere Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion taught in the Scriptures; and in the next place to the uſages of the Primitive Church.</hi> Being ſatisfied in both which ways, they had thirdly a more particular reſpect to the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Plat-forms, the Engliſh Confeſſion or Book of Articles being taken in many places word for word out of that of <hi>Ausberg,</hi> and a conformity maintained with the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches in Rights and Ceremonies; as namely, in kneeling at the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the Croſs in Baptiſm, the retaining of all the ancient Feſtivals, the reading of the Epiſtles and Goſpels on Sundays and Holy-days, and generally in the whole Form of External Worſhip.

                     <p>3. I obſerve finally, That as they attributed much to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, to the Authority of <hi>Melancthon,</hi> ſo they aſcribe no leſs therein unto that of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> once Reader of the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and afterwards one of the Profeſſors of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

there; whoſe Paraphraſes on the four Evangeliſts being tranſlated into Engliſh, were ordered to be kept in Churches for the uſe of the People, and that they owned the Epiſtles to be ſtudied by all ſuch as had cure of ſouls: Concerning which it was commanded by the injunctions of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, publiſhed by the advice of the Lord Protector <hi>Somerſet</hi> and the Privy Council, in the firſt year of the ſaid Kings Reign: 1. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'That<note place="margin">Acts and Mon. fol. 1181.</note> they ſhould ſee provided in ſome moſt convenient and open place of every Church, one Great Bible in Engliſh, with the Paraphraſe of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in Engliſh, that the people might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verendly, without any let, read and hear the ſame at ſuch time as they liſted, and not to be inhibited therefrom by the Parſon or Curate; but rather to be the more encouraged and provoked thereunto.

That every Prieſt under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a Bachellour of Divinity, ſhould have of his own, one New Teſtament in Engliſh and Latine, with the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſes</hi> of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> upon the ſame, and ſhould diligently read and ſtudy thereupon, and ſhould collect and keep in memory all ſuch comfortable places of the Scripture, as do ſet forth the Mercy, Benefits and Goodneſs of Almighty God towards all penitent and believing perſons, that they might thereby comfort their flock in all danger of death, deſpair or trouble of Conſcience; and that therefore every Biſhop in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſhould from time to time try and examine them how they have profited in their ſtudies.'</q> A courſe and care not likely to have entred into the thoughts of the Lord Protector, or any of the Lords of the Council, if it had not been adviſed by ſome of the Biſhops, who then began to have an eye on the Reformation, which ſoon after followed; and as unlikely to be counſelled and adviſed by them, had they intended to advance any other Doctrine, than what was countenanced in the writings of that learned man. Whereupon I conclude, the Doctrine in the points diſputed, to be the true and genuine Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which comes moſt near to the plain ſenſe of holy Scripture, the general current of the Fathers in the Primitive times, the famous <hi>Augustane</hi> Confeſſion, the Writings of <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and the Workes of <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:</hi> To which Concluſion I ſhall ſtand, till I finde my

                     </p>
                     <p>5. Now from theſe Books, the Doctrine of Predeſtination<note place="margin">Institut. of a Christian.</note> may be gathered into theſe particulars; which I deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take notice of, that he may judge the better of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity which it hath with the eſtabliſhed Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

                     <p>1. That man by his own nature was born in ſin, and in the indignation and diſpleaſure of God, and was the very childe of Wrath, condemned to everlaſting death, ſubject and thrall to the power of the Devil and ſin; having all the principal parts or portions of his ſoul, as Reaſon and underſtanding, and free-wil, and all other powers of his ſoul and body, not onely ſo
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:130574:70"/>
deſtituted and deprived of the gifts of God wherewith they were firſtendued, but alſo ſo blinded, corrupted and poyſoned with errour, ignorance and carnal concupiſcence, that neither his ſaid powers could exerciſe the natural function and office for which they were ordained by God at the firſt Creation, nor could he by them do any thing which might be acceptable to God.</p>
                     <p>2. That Jeſus Chriſt the onely begotten Son of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was eternally pre-ordained and appointed by the Decree of the Holy Trinity, to be our Lord; that is to ſay, to be the onely Redeemer and Saviour of Mankinde, and to reduce and bring the ſame from under the Dominion of the Devil and ſin, unto his onely Dominion, Kingdom, Lordſhip and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
                     <p>3. That when the time was come in the which it was before<note place="margin">Neceſſary pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</note> ordained and appointed by the Decree of the Holy Trinity, That Mankinde ſhould be ſaved and redeemed, then the Son of God, the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, and very God, deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Heaven into the world, to take upon him the very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, form and nature of man, and in the ſame nature to ſuffer his glorious Paſſion for the Redemption and Salvation of all Mankinde.</p>
                     <p>4. That by this Paſſion and Death of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, not onely Corporal death is ſo deſtroyed, that it ſhall never hurt us, but rather that it is made wholeſome and profitable unto us; but alſo, that all our ſins, and the ſins alſo of all them <hi>that do believe in him, and follow him,</hi> be mortified and dead; that is to ſay, all the guilt and offence thereof, as alſo the damnation and pains due for the ſame, is clearly extincted, aboliſhed and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, ſo that the ſame ſhall never afterwards be imputed and inflicted on us.</p>
                     <p>5. That this Redemption and Juſtification of Mankinde could not have been wrought or brought to paſs by any other means in the world, but by the means of this Jeſus Chriſt, Gods onely Son; and that never man could yet, nor never ſhall be able to come unto God the Father, or to believe in him, or to attain his favour, by his own wit and reaſon, or by his own ſcience and learning, or by any his own works, or by whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:130574:70"/>
may be named in Heaven or Earth, but by faith in the Name and Power of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and by the gifts and graces of his Holy Spirit.</p>
                     <p>6. But to proceed, the way to the enſuing Reformation being thus laid open; The firſt great work which was accompliſhed in purſuance of it, was, the compiling of that famous Liturgie of the year, 1549. commanded by King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth; that is to ſay, the Lord Protector, and the reſt of the Privy Council, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Name, and by his Authority, performed by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Cramner,</hi> and the other ſix before remembred, aſſiſted by <hi>Thirdby</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Weſtminster, Day</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter, Ridley</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rochester, Taylor</hi> (then Dean, after) Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lincoln, Redman</hi> then Maſter of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and <hi>Hains</hi> Dean of <hi>Exeter,</hi> all men of great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in their ſeveral ſtations; and finally, confirmed by the King, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in Parliament aſſembled, 23 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. In which Confirmatory act it is ſaid expreſly to have been done <hi>by the eſpecial aid of the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which teſtimony I finde alſo of it in the <hi>Acts and Monuments, fol.</hi> 1184. But being diſliked by <hi>Calvin,</hi> who would needs be meddling in all matters which concerned Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and diſliked it chiefly for no other reaſon (as appears in one of his Epiſtles to the Lord Protector) but becauſe it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured too much of the ancient forms, it was brought under a review, the cauſe of the reviewing of it being given out to be no other, <hi>than that there had riſen divers doubts in the Exerciſe of the ſaid Book, for the faſhion and manner of the Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though riſen rather by the curioſity of the Miniſters and Mistakers, then of any other cauſe, 5, 6 Edw. 6. cap.</hi> 1. The review made by thoſe who had firſt compiled it, though <hi>Hobeach</hi> and <hi>Redman</hi> might be dead before the confirmation of it by Act of Parliament, ſome of the New Biſhops added to the former number, and being reviewed, was brought into the ſame form in which now it ſtands; ſave, that a clauſe was taken out of the <hi>Letany,</hi> and a ſentence added to the <hi>deſtribution</hi> of the bleſſed Sacrament, in the firſt year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and that ſome alteration was made in two or three of the Rubricks, with an

addition of Thanſgiving in the end of the Letany; as alſo of a Prayer for the Queen and the Royal Iſſue in the firſt of King <hi>James.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. At the ſame time, and by the ſame hands which gave us the Firſt Liturgie of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, was the firſt Book of Homilies compoſed alſo; in which I have ſome cauſe to think, that Biſhop <hi>Latimer</hi> was made uſe of amongſt the reſt, as one who had ſubſcribed the firſt other two Books before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as Biſhop of <hi>Worcester, anno</hi> 1537. and ever ſince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued zealous for a Reformation, quitting in that reſpect ſuch a wealthy Biſhoprick, becauſe he neither would nor could conform his judgement to the Doctrine of the ſix Articles Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by Parliament: For it will eaſily appear to any, who is converſant in <hi>Latimers</hi> writings, and will compare them care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with the Book of Homilies, that they do not onely ſavour of the ſame ſpirit in point of Doctrine, but alſo of the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular and familiar ſtile, which that godly Martyr followed in the courſe of his preachings; for though the making of theſe Homilies be commonly aſcribed (and in particularr by Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>) to Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> yet it is to be underſtood no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of him, then that it was chiefly done by encouragement and direction, not ſparing his own hand to advance the work, as his great occaſions did permit. That they were made at the ſame time with King <hi>Edwards</hi> firſt Liturgie, will appear as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, firſt by the <hi>Rubrick</hi> in the ſaid Liturgie it ſelf, in which it is directed, that <hi>after the Creed ſhall follow the Sermon or Homily, or ſome portion of one of them, as they ſhall be hereafter divided.</hi> It<note place="margin">Let. of Mr. <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> to the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

How we are to underſtand them in reſpect of the meaning. And firſt for their Authority; it was as good in all regards as the Laws could give them, being firſt treated and agreed upon by the Biſhops and Clergie in their Convocation, and afterwards confirmed by the Letters Patents of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. under the Great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
                        <pb n="29" facs="tcp:130574:73"/>
But againſt this it is objected, That the Records of this Convocation are but a degree above blanks; that the Biſhops and Clergie then aſſembled, had no Commiſſion from the King to meddle in Church buſineſs; that the King durſt not truſt the Clergie of that time in ſo great a matter, on a juſt jealouſie which he had of the ill affections of the major part; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the truſt of this great buſineſs, <hi>was committed unto ſome few Confidents, cordial to the cauſe of Religion,</hi> and not unto the body of a Convocation. To which it hath been already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That the Objector is here guilty of a greater crime than that of <hi>Scandalum magnatum,</hi> making King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth of pious memory, no better than an impious and lewd Impoſtor, in fathering thoſe children on the Convocation, which had not been of their begetting: For firſt, the title to the Articles runneth thus at large, <hi>Art<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the King had no reaſon to have any ſuch <hi>jealouſie</hi> at that time of the <hi>major part</hi> of the Clergie, but that he <hi>might truſt them with a power to meddle with matters of Religion;</hi> this Convocation being holden the ſixth year of his Reign, when <hi>Gardiner, Bonner, Day</hi> and <hi>Tunſtall,</hi> and others of the ſtiffeſt Romaniſts, were put out of their places; moſt of the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Sees, and Parochial Churches being filled with men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto his deſires<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and generally con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ormable to the Forms of Worſhip here by Law eſtabliſhed. Thirdly, the Church of <hi>England</hi> for the firſt five years of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> retained theſe Articles, and no other, as the publike <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And Fourthly, that it is true, that the Records of Convocation during this King, and the firſt years of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> are very defective and imperfect, moſt of them loſt; amongſt others, thoſe of this preſent year: And yet one may conclude as ſtrongly, that my mother dyed childeleſs, becauſe my Chriſtening is not to be found in the Pariſh Regiſter; as that the Convocation of this year was barren, becauſe the Acts and Articles of it were not entred in the Journal Book.</p>

                        <pb n="30" facs="tcp:130574:74"/>11. To ſalve this ſore, it is conceived by the Objector, that the Biſhops and Clergie had paſſed over their power to ſome <q rend="inline margQuotes">'ſelect Divines appointed by the King; in which ſenſe they may be ſaid to have made theſe Articles themſelves, by their delegates, to whom they had deputed their Authority, the caſe not being ſo clear, but that it occaſioned a cavil at the<note place="margin">Id. Ib.</note> next Convocation the firſt of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> when the Papiſts therein aſſembled, renounced the legality of any ſuch for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tranſactions.'</q> And unto this it ſhall be anſwered, That no ſuch defect of legality as was here pretended, was charged againſt the Book of Articles it ſelf, but onely againſt a Catechiſm which was bound up with it, countenanced by the Kings Letters Patents prefixt before it, approved by many Biſhops and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, and generally voyced to be another of the products of this Convocation: And therefore for ſo much as concerns this Catechiſm, it was replied by Mr. <hi>John Philpot</hi> Archdeacon of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who had been a member in the former, and was now a member of the Convocation in the firſt of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> That he thought they were deceived in the Title of it, in that<note place="margin">Acts and Mon. fol. 1282.</note> it owned the Title of the laſt Synod of <hi>London,</hi> many which were then preſent, not being made privy to the making or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of it. He added, That the ſaid former Convocation, had granted the Authority of making excellent Laws, unto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain perſons to be appointed by the Kings Majeſtie; ſo as what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Eccleſiaſtical Laws they, or the moſt part of them did ſet forth (according to a Statute in that behalf provided) might be well ſaid to be done in the Synod of <hi>London,</hi> though ſuch as were of the houſe, had no notice thereof before the promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation: And thereupon he did infer, That the ſetters forth of the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> did not ſlander the Houſe, as they went about to perſwade the world, ſince they had the Authority of the Synod unto them committed, to make ſuch Spiritual Laws as they thought convenient and neceſſary for the good of the Church. In which diſcourſe we may obſerve, that there was not one word which reflects on the Book of Articles, all of it being made in reference to the Catechiſm before remembred; though if the Objection had been made (as indeed it was not) againſt the Articles themſelves, the defence of that learned man, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:130574:74"/>
godly Martyr, would have ſerved as fully for the one, as it did for the other. But whatſoever may be ſaid in derogation to the Authority of the Book of Articles, as it was publiſhed in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1552. certain I am, that nothing can be ſaid unto the contrary, but that they were received, and the far greater part of them agreed upon in full Convocation, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1562, And therefore for avoiding of all diſputes, I am reſolved to take them in this laſt capacity, as they were ratified by Queen <hi>Elizabeth, Anno,</hi> 1563. confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by King <hi>James, Anno</hi> 1604. and finally eſtabliſhed by the late King <hi>Charls,</hi> with his Majeſties Royal Declaration prefixt before them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>12. Leſs doubt there is concerning the intent of this Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in drawing up the Articles in ſo looſe a manner, that men of different judgements might accommodate them to their own opinions, which I finde both obſerved and commended in them by the former Author; by whom we are informed, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Engliſh Proteſtant Church, in the infancy thereof,<note place="margin">Chur. Hiſt. lib. 9. fol. 72.</note> were drawn up in general terms, foreſeeing that poſterity would grow up to fill the ſame; meaning, that theſe holy men did prudently diſcover, that differences in judgement would una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably happen in the Church, and were loth to unchurch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and drive them off from an Eccleſiaſtical communion for petty differences, which made them pen the Articles in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive words, to take in all, who differing in the branches, meet in the root of the ſame Religion: This hath been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved to have been the artifice of thoſe who had the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and is affirmed to have been uſed by ſuch men alſo as had the drawing up of the Canons at the Synod at <hi>Dort:</hi> But the Compoſers of the Articles of the Church of <hi>England</hi> had not ſo little in them of the <hi>Dove,</hi> or ſo much of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> as to make the Articles of the Church like an upright ſhoe, which may be worn on either foot; or like to <hi>Theranc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:130574:75"/>
                        <hi>London</hi> in relation to the Rubrick in private Baptiſm; that is to ſay, that thoſe reverend and learned men intended not to deceive any by ambiguous terms; for which, ſee <hi>Conf. at Hampton Court,</hi> p. 15. And to this ſuppoſition or imagination it is alſo<note place="margin">Conſer.</note> anſwered, That the firſt Reformers did not ſo compoſe the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, as to <hi>leave any liberty</hi> to diſſenting judgements, as the ſaid Author would fain have it in ſome words preceding, but did not binde men to the literal and Grammatical ſenſe; they had not otherwiſe attained to the end they aimed at, which was <hi>ad tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendam Opinionum Diſſentionem, &amp; conſenſum in vera Religione firmandum;</hi> that is to ſay, to take away diverſity of opinions, and to eſtabliſh an agreement in the true Riligion. Which end could never be effected, if men were left unto the liberty of diſſenting, or might have leave to put their own ſenſe upon the Articles, as they liſt themſelves: For where there is a purpoſe of permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting men to their own opinions, there is no need of definitions and determinations in a National Church, no more than is of making Laws to binde the Subjects in an unſettled Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, with an intent to leave them in their former liberty, either of keeping or not keeping them, as themſelves beſt pleaſed. Which ſaid, we ſhall enquire into the meaning of the Articles, as before laid down, whether they ſpeak in favour of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthonian</hi> or <hi>Calvinian</hi> way, ſo far forth as the meaning of them can be gathered from the publique Liturgie and Book of Homilies, or from the Writings of thoſe men, who either had a hand in the making of them, or dyed in the Religion here by Law eſtabliſhed.</p>

                        <hi>inſtructed in the Doctrine of Gods Election:</hi> The words of which Letter are as followeth, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'I wiſh to you my good Brethren the ſame grace of God in Chriſt, which I wiſh and pray the Father of mercies to give me for his holy names ſake, <hi>amen.</hi> Your Letter, though I have not read my ſelf, becauſe I would not alienate my minde from conceived things, to write to others, yet I have heard the ſum of it, that it is of Gods Election; wherein I will briefly relate to you my faith, and how far I think it good and meet for a Chriſtian to wade in. I believe, That man made after the image of God, did fall from that pleaſed eſtate, to the condemnation of him and all his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity: I believe that Chriſt (for man being then fallen) did oppoſe himſelf to the judgement of God, as a Mediator pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ranſome and price of Redemption for <hi>Adam</hi> and his whole poſterity, that <hi>refuſe it not finally:</hi> I believe, that all that <hi>believe</hi> (I ſpeak of ſuch as be of years of diſcretion) are partakers of Chriſt and all his merits: I believe, that faith and <hi>belief</hi> in Chriſt is the work and gift of God, given to no other then to thoſe which be his children; that is, to thoſe whom God the Father before the beginning of the world, hath Predeſtinated in Chriſt unto Eternal life. Thus do I wade in Predeſtination, in ſuch ſort as God hath patefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and opened it. Though to God it be the firſt, yet to us it is the laſt opened; and therefore I begin with Creation,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:130574:80"/>
from whence I come to Redemption, ſo to Juſtification, ſo to Election. On this ſort I am ſure that warily and wiſely a man may walk it eaſily by the light of Gods Spirit, in and by his Word, ſeeing this faith is not to be given to all men, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. but to ſuch as are born of God, Predeſtinated before the world was made, after the purpoſe and good will of God, &amp;c.'</q> Which judgement of this holy man, comes up ſo cloſe to that of the former Martyrs, and is ſo plainly croſs to that of the <hi>Calvinistical</hi> party, that Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> was fain to make ſoom <hi>Scholia's</hi> on it, to reconcile a gloſs like that of <hi>Orleance,</hi> which corrupts the Text; and therefore to have no place here, however it may be diſpoſed of at another time. But beſides the Epiſtle above mentioned, there is extant a Diſcourſe of the ſaid god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Martyr, entituled, <hi>The ſum of the Doctrine of Predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reprobation;</hi> in which is affirmed, <hi>That our own wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſin, and contemning of Chriſt, are the cauſe of Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as is confeſſed by the Author of the <hi>Anti-Arminianiſm, p.</hi> 103. though afterwards he puts ſuch a gloſs upon it (as he doth alſo on the like paſſages in Biſhop <hi>Hooper</hi>) as makes the ſin of man to be the cauſe onely of the <hi>execution,</hi> and not of the decree of Reprobation.</p>

                     <p>10. Some paſſages I grant there are, which ſpeak of Gods people, and his choſen people, and yet intend not any ſuch <hi>Perſonal and Eternal Election,</hi> as theſe men conceit unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Of which ſort theſe, <hi>viz. To declare and pronounce to his people being penitent—O Lord ſave thy people, and bleſs thy heritage—that it would pleaſe thee to keep and bleſs all thy people—and make thy choſen people joyful,</hi> with many others interſpers'd in ſeveral places: But then I muſt affirm with all,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:130574:81"/>
that thoſe paſſages are no otherwiſe to be underſtood, than of the whole body of the Church, the Congregation of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, called to the publique participation of the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: Which appears plainly by the Prayer for the <hi>Church Militant here on earth;</hi> where having called upon the Lord, and ſaid, <hi>To all thy people give thy heavenly grace;</hi> we are taught preſently to adde, <hi>eſpecially to this Congregation here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;</hi> that is to ſay, the members of that particular Church, which there pour forth their prayers for the Church in general. More to their purpoſe is that paſſage in the Collect for the Feaſt of <hi>All-Saints;</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>That Almighty God hath knit together his Elect in one communion and fellowſhip in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical body of his Son Jeſus Christ;</hi> though it doth ſignifie no more but that inſeparable bond of Charity, that Love and Unity, that Holy Communion and Correſpondency which is between the Saints in Glory in the Church Triumphant, and thoſe who are ſtill exerciſed under the cares and miſeries of this preſent life in the Church here <hi>Militant.</hi> But it makes moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their purpoſe (if any thing could make unto their purpoſe in the Common-Prayer Book) that at the burial of the dead we are taught to pray, That God <hi>would pleaſe of his gracious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhortly to accompliſh the number of his elect, and to haſten his Kingdom:</hi> From whence, as poſſibly ſome may raiſe this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, That by the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England, there is a predestinated and certain number of Elect, which can neither be increaſed nor diminiſhed,</hi> according to the third of the nine Articles which were agreed upon at <hi>Lambeth:</hi> So others may perhaps conclude, That this number is made up out of ſuch <hi>Elections,</hi> ſuch <hi>Perſonal</hi> and <hi>Eternal Elections</hi> as they have fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to themſelves. But there is nothing in the Prayer, which can be uſeful to the countenancing of any ſuch fancy, the number of the <hi>Elect,</hi> and the certainty of that number, being known onely unto God in the way of his <hi>Preſcience,</hi> by which he ſeeth all things paſt, and all things to come, as if preſent with him. And therefore having paſt a general Decree of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, touching the ſaving of all thoſe which believe in Chriſt, and knowing moſt infallibly who, and how many of all Nations will believe in Chriſt, continue in the faith to the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:130574:81"/>
end of their lives, and conſequently attain ſalvation: The number of the perſons ſo Predeſtinated, is as well known unto him in the univerſal comprehenſion of his Heavenly <hi>Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> as if they had been perſonally elected unto life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, the accompliſhing of which number, that ſo his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may be haſtned, and the haſtning of his Kingdom, <hi>that we, with all the rest which are departed in the true faith of his holy Name, may have our perfect Conſummation and bliſs both in body and ſoul,</hi> is the ſcope and purpoſe of that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: And being the ſole ſcope and purpoſe of it, cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſuch a Perſonal and Eternal Election as ſome men ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, though it conclude both for a number, and for a certain number of Gods Elect.</p>

All men be alſo to be moniſhed, and chiefly Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that in this high matter they looking on both ſides, ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper and moderate themſelves, that neither they ſo preach the Grace of God, as to take away thereby</hi> Free-will; <hi>Nor on the other ſide ſo extol</hi> Free-will, <hi>that injury be done to the grace of God.</hi>

                     <p>3. Such was the judgment of the Biſhops and Clergy aſſembled in Convocation, <hi>An.</hi> 1543. touching the nature of <hi>Free-will,</hi> and the co-operations of it with the grace of God; In which I can ſee nothing not agreeable to the preſent eſtabliſht Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And if it be objected, as perhaps it may, that this Convocation was held in times of Popery, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:130574:96"/>
managed by a Popiſh Clergy; it may be anſwered that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Clergy then aſſembled were ſuch as had a principal hand in the Reformation, and generally ſubſcribed unto the Articles of Religion, agreed upon, and publiſhed in King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> time, <hi>Anno</hi> 1552. At which time fifteen of the Biſhops which had been preſent at the Convocation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1543. were not only living, but preſent, and conſenting to the Articles in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, that is to ſay, <hi>Cranmer</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury; Parfew,</hi> Biſhop of Saint <hi>Aſaph; Buchely,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bangor; Buſh,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Briſtol; Sampſon,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Litch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field; Butler,</hi> Biſhop of Saint <hi>David; Goodrich,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Elie; Ship,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hereford; Folgate,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> and afterwards Arch-biſhop of <hi>York; King,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oxon; Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough; Cepon,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sarum; Thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Nor ſtood this Book nor the Article of <hi>Free-will</hi> therein contained, upon the order and authority only of this Convocation, but had as good countenance and encouragement to walk abroad as could be ſuperadded to it by an Act of Parliament, as appears plainly by the Kings Preface to that Book, and the Act it ſelf, to which for brevity ſake I refer the Reader.</p>

But if it be replyed, that there is no relying on the Acts of Parliament which were generally ſwayed, changed, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruled by the power and paſſions of the King; and that the Act of Parliament which approved this Book, was repealed in the firſt year of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, as indeed it was: we might refer the Reader to a paſſage in the Kings Epiſtle, before
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:130574:96"/>
remembred, in which the doctrine of <hi>Free-will</hi> is affirmed to have been purged of all Popiſh errors; concerning which take here the words of the Epiſtle, <hi>viz. And foraſmuch as the heads and ſenſes of our people have been imbuſied, and in theſe days</hi>

For proof whereof I am to put the Reader in minde of a Letter of the ſaid Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, relating to the eighth Chapter of this Book; in which he ſignified to an honourable friend of his, that he had taken the more paines in it, <hi>becauſe the Book being to be ſet forth by his Graces</hi> (that is to ſay the Kings) <hi>cenſure and judgement, he could have nothing in it that</hi> Momus <hi>himſelf</hi> could repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, as before was ſaid: And this I hope will be ſufficient to free this Treatiſe of <hi>Free-will</hi> from the crime of Popery.</p>
                     <p>5. But finally, if notwithſtanding all theſe Reaſons, it ſhall be ſtill preſſed by thoſe of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> party, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Free-will,</hi> which is there delivered, is in all points the ſame with that which was concluded and agreed on in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as appears <hi>Cap. de fructibus juſtificationis, &amp; merito bonorum operum Can.</hi> 34. and therefore not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted any part of the Proteſtant Doctrine; which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and maintained by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> according to the firſt Rules of her Reformation: the anſwers will be many, and every anſwer not without its weight and moment.

                     <p>3. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'The force of theſe Reaſons made them firſt retire a little that cenſured the opinion of Temerity, and yield that there might be a conjecture; though not an ordinary certainty; yet they acknowledged a certainty in the Martyrs, in the newly baptized, and in ſome by ſpecial revelation, and from conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, they were brought to call it moral Faith: And that <hi>Vego</hi> who in the beginning admitted probability only, overcome by theſe Reaſons, and beginning to favour the certainty, for fear of conforming himſelf to the <hi>Lutheran</hi> opinion, ſaid that there was ſo much certainty as did exclude all doubt, and could not be deceived;'</q> yet that it was not <hi>Chriſtian Faith, but humane and experimental.</hi> But <hi>Calarinus</hi> and his party which were all the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> not reſting ſatisfied either in the termes of an <hi>experimental faith,</hi> or a <hi>moral perſwaſion,</hi> did preſſe the certainty ſo farre, that many of the Prelate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:130574:99"/>
two contrary opinions might repoſe themſelves on it. And certainly he that looks on the ninth Chapter of the ſixth Seſſion of the Council entituled <hi>Contra inanem Haereticorum fiduciam,</hi> may eaſily perceive into what ſtreights they were reduced by ſeeking to content the Leaders of the ſeveral factions. For when the Decree came to be diſcuſſed, it was no hard matter to make them joyne againſt that confidence which was maintained by many of <hi>Luthers</hi> followers, as if a man were no otherwiſe juſtified than by the confidence which he had in his own juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; yet when they came to expreſſe that certainty which had occaſioned that intricate and perplexed diſpute, they were not ſo well able to ſtate the point, as not to ſhew their own irreſolution and uncertainty in it. For in the concluſion of the Decree in which they were to declare ſome cauſe for which no man could certainly know that he hath obtained Grace at the hands of God, the Cardinal to ſatisfie one part, added certainty of faith: and he with the <hi>Dominicans</hi> not thinking it to be enough, urged him to adde the word Catholick to it; ſo that the ſence thereof might ſeeme to be to this effect; that no man could aſſure himſelf of obtaining Grace by any ſuch certainty of Faith as may come under the notion of Catholick. But becauſe the Adherents of <hi>Calarius</hi> were not ſo contented, inſtead of thoſe words of <hi>Catholick Faith</hi> (on which the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Hist. of the Coun. of Trent. fol. 215.</note> inſiſted) it was thought neceſſary to declare that they meant it not of ſuch a faith, <hi>cui non poteſt ſubeſſe falſum,</hi> which cannot be ſubject to falſhood.

Theſe are the paſſages which Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> hath gathered out of <hi>Poynets</hi> Catechiſm, to prove that <hi>Calviniſm</hi> is the true, genuine, and Original Doctrine of the reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the Points diſputed; for my part, I can ſee no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible inconvenience which can follow on it, in yeilding ſo far to his deſires, as to admit the paſſages before recited, <hi>to be fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the true, genuine ſenſe,</hi> and proper meaning of all, <hi>but more eſpecially of our</hi> 9. 10. 13. 16. and 17. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles then newly compoſed;</hi> ſo that whatſoever is <hi>poſitively and clearly affirmed in this Catechiſme of any of the Points now controverted, may be ſafely implied as the undoubted Doctrine of our Church and Articles.</hi> For who can find, if he looks upon them with a ſingle and impartial eye, that all or any of the paſſages before treated, can be made uſe of for the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing of ſuch a perſonal and eternal election, without rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto ſin, as is ſuppoſed by the <hi>Supra-Lapſarians,</hi> or without reference to Chriſts death and ſufferings, as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by the <hi>Sublapſarians</hi> in the Schools of <hi>Calvin?</hi> what ground can a man find here for the <hi>Horribile Decretum,</hi> that cruel and moſt unmerciful decree of preordaining the far greateſt part of all mankind to everlaſting damnation, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto ſin that they might be damned?

And finally what aſſurance is here, that the man once juſtified ſhall not fal into deadly ſin, or not continue in the ſame, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying one ſin upon another till he hath made up the meaſure of his iniquities? and yet all this while remain in the favour of God, and be as ſure and certain of his own ſalvation by the like unreſiſtible working of the holy Spirit, as if he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wandred from the ways of Righteouſneſs!

And firſt the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor let us know that God created man after his own <hi>Image,</hi> that is to ſay (<hi>in ea abſolutiſſima Justitia, &amp; perfectiſſima ſanctimonia, &amp;c.</hi>) in ſuch a high degree of righteouſneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holineſſe as came moſt neare unto the nature of God himſelfe; that this Divine image was ſo defaced by the ſin of our firſt parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> that thoſe lineaments of righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, truth, and knowledge of God were diſordered, and almoſt obliterated; that man being in this wretched caſe, it pleaſed God to raiſe him to a new hope of Reſtitution in the ſeed of the woman, that is to ſay, in <hi>Jeſus-Chriſt</hi> his only Son, conceived of the holy Ghoſt, and born of the pure and moſt immaculate Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> the Actions of whoſe life do ſo much redound to our benefit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, that <hi>if we cleave faſt unto them with a true and lively faith,</hi> they ſhall be as much ours as his; and finally, that as many as are in this faith ſtedfaſt, were fore-choſen, predeſtinate, and appointed to everlaſting life before the world was made. 2. In the next place he lets us know (which the Author hath amongſt his fragments) that the ſacrificings, cleanſings, waſhings, and other Ceremonies of the Law were ſhadows, types, images, and figures of the true and eternal ſacrifice of Jeſus Chriſt made upon the Croſſe; by whoſe benefit alone all the ſins of <hi>all believers</hi> from the beginning of the world, are pardoned by the ſole mercy of God, and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:130574:113"/>
not by any deſerts of their own. But then he lets us know withal (which that Author doth not) that he did truly die, and was truly buried, <hi>ut <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> that by ſo ſweet a ſacrifice he might reconcile his angry and offended father unto <hi>all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</hi> 3. In the third place, by asking this queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the Spirit alone and faith, ſleep we never ſo ſecurely, or ſtand we never ſo worthleſſe or ſlothful, work all things for us, as without any help of our own to carry us to heaven? He plainly ſheweth firſt that ſome men there were who did ſo conceive it, but that they were to be condemned for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſo of it. And, ſecondly, that all men were to lend a helping hand toward their ſalvation, not only by laying hold on Chriſt with the hand of faith, but in being fruitful of good works, without which, faith is neither to be reckoned true and lively<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or animated by the holy Ghoſt. 4. He telleth us finally, that the Church is the company of them that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to eternal life by the holy Ghoſt, by whom ſhe is guided and governed. And yet it cannot but be feared, that many of thoſe who are called to eternal life by the holy Ghoſt, and chearfully for a time obey the calling, and live continually within the pale of the Church, which is guided by the moſt bleſſed ſpirit, do fall away from God and the grace received, and thereby bring themſelues into a ſtate of damnation from which they never do recover by ſincere repentance.</p>
                     <p>5. As little comfort can be drawn from that Argument, by which they hope to make the Articles in theſe points to ſpeak no otherwiſe then according to the ſenſe of <hi>Martin Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> by whoſe Diſciples and <hi>Auditors they are alledged to have been compoſed, or at the leaſt by ſuch as hold conſent with them in Doctrine;</hi> but unto this it hath been anſwered, that our firſt reformers were two old Arch-Biſhops, Deans, and Arch-Deacons, moſt of them to be put to School again to either of them. Secondly, the firſt Liturgy of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, which was the key to the whole work, was finiſhed, confirmed, and put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before either of them were brought over; Diſpatcht ſoon
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:130574:113"/>
after their arrival to their ſeveral chaires; <hi>Martyr</hi> to the <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lecture</hi> in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> unto that of <hi>Cambridge</hi> where<note place="margin">Godw. Annal. in Edw. 6.</note> he lived not long. And dying ſo quickly as he did, (<hi>Luctu Academiae,</hi> as my Author hath it) though he had many <hi>Auditors</hi> there, yet could he not gain many Diſciples in ſo ſhort a time. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that though <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> lived to ſee the Death of King <hi>Edward,</hi> and conſequently the end of the Convocation, <hi>An.</hi> 1552. in which the Articles of Religion were firſt compoſed and agreed on; yet there was little uſe made of him in adviſing, and much leſſe in dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting any thing which concerned that buſineſs; for being a ſtranger, and but one, and ſuch an one who had no Authority in Church or State, he could not be conſidered as a Maſter-builder, though ſome uſe might be made of him as a labourer to advance the work. And, fourthly, as to their conſent in point of doctrine, it muſt be granted in ſuch things, and in ſuch things only in which they joyn together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts, not in ſuch points wherein thoſe learned men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed not between themſelves, and therefore could be no foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of conſent in others.</p>
                     <p>6. For they who have conſulted the Lives and Writings of theſe learned men, have generally obſerved that <hi>Bucer</hi> having ſpent the moſt part of his time in the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches, was more agreeable to the doctrines which were there maintained; as <hi>Martyr</hi> who was moſt converſant amongſt the <hi>Suitzers,</hi> ſhewed himſelf more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> or <hi>Calvinian</hi> Tenents. And it is generally ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved alſo that <hi>Bucer</hi> was a man of moderate counſel, and for that received a check from <hi>Calvin,</hi> at his firſt coming hither, putting him in remembrance of his old fault (for a fault he thought it) <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And governing himſelf with ſuch moderation, he well approved of the firſt Liturgie, tranſlated into Latine by <hi>Alexander Aleſius</hi> a learned <hi>Scot,</hi> that he might be the better able to underſtand the compoſure of it, and paſſe his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the ſame accordingly. And yet it cannot be denied, but that there are many paſſages in the firſt Liturgie which tend directly to the maintenance of univerſal Redemption by the death of Chriſt, of the co-operation of mans will with the grace of God, and finally of the poſſibility of falling from that grace, and other the benefits and fruits thereof before received. In which laſt point it is affirmed
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:130574:114"/>
that he amongſt ſome others of the Proteſtant Doctors, aſſented to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> at the Dyet at <hi>Ratisbone.</hi> And it is more then probable that <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> was not <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> I mean that he was not the ſame man as the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> and <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrine is, and his eſpouſing the ſame being here as he was after his departure, when he had ſpent ſome further time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Suitzers,</hi> and was thereby grown a nearer neighbour unto <hi>Calvin</hi> then he was in <hi>England.</hi> For whereas his Book of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-places,</hi> and his Commentary to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> are moſt inſiſted on for the proof of his <hi>Calviniſme;</hi> it appeares<note place="margin">

By which Edition being that which is in <hi>Oxon</hi> Library, and probably remaining only in the hands of Students, or in the private Libraries of Colledges, it will be hard, if not impoſſible, to judge of his opinion in theſe points, when he lived in <hi>England.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>8. By which paſſages and the reſt that follow on this Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, we may have a plain view of the judgement of this learned man in the points diſputed, as to the <hi>deſignation of eternal life</hi> to all that do <hi>believe</hi> in Chriſt, the <hi>univerſality</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> by his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>paſſion,</hi> the <hi>general offer</hi> of the <hi>benefit</hi> and effect thereof to all <hi>ſorts of people;</hi> the <hi>freedom</hi> of <hi>mans will</hi> in <hi>co-operating</hi> with the grace of God, or in <hi>rejecting</hi> and <hi>refuſing</hi> it when it is ſo offered, and relapſing from the ſame when it is ſo offered, and relapſing from the ſame when it is received. All which we finde in many other paſſages of thoſe <hi>Paraphraſes,</hi> as occaſion is preſented to him. But more particularly it appears, firſt, that he groundeth our election to <hi>eternal life,</hi> on the <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>divine preſcience</hi> of Almighty God; telling us in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the 25. ch. of St. <hi>Matthews</hi> Goſpel, <hi>that the inheritance</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 96.</note> 
                        <hi>of the heavenly Kingdom was prepared by the</hi> providence <hi>and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God the</hi> fore-knower <hi>of all things before the world was made.</hi> Secondly, of <hi>univerſal Redemption,</hi> in his gloſſe on the 1. <hi>chap.</hi> of St. <hi>John,</hi> he telleth us thus; <hi>This Lamb</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is ſo far from being ſubject to any kind of ſin, that he alone is able to take away</hi> all the ſins<note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 414.</note> of the whole world. <hi>He is ſo well beloved of God, that he only may turn his wrath into mercy; He is alſo ſo gentle, and ſo deſirous of</hi> mans ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>that he is ready to ſuffer pains for</hi> the ſins of all men, <hi>and to take upon him our evils, becauſe he would beſtow upon us his good things.</hi> Thirdly, of the manner of the working of Gods grace, he ſpeaks as plainly in his Explication of the 6. <hi>chap.</hi> of the ſame Evangeliſt;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:130574:115"/>
where he telleth us, that <hi>of a truth whoſoever cometh unto Chriſt, ſhall obtain eternal life; that by faith muſt men come to him, and that faith cometh not at all aventures, but is had by the inſpiration of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>

                        <hi>who like as he draweth to him mens mindes by his Son, in ſuch wiſe that through the operation of both joyntly together, men come to them both: the Father not giving this ſo great gift, but to them that be</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>and</hi> deſirous <hi>to have it; ſo that who with a</hi> ready will <hi>and</hi> godly diligence, deſerves to be drawn <hi>of the father, he ſhall obtaine everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life by the Son.</hi> No <hi>violent drawing</hi> in theſe words, but ſuch as may be capable of <hi>reſiſtance</hi> on the part of man, as appears by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcant on that plain ſong of our Saviour in <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. in which he makes him ſpeaking in this manner unto thoſe of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> viz. <hi>Nothing is let paſſe on my behalf, whereby thou mighteſt be ſaved: but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 90.</note> 
                        <hi>thou hast done what thou canſt to bring deſtruction upon thy ſelf, and to</hi> exclude ſalvation <hi>from thee.

The like affirmed by the Author of the Table of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination;</hi> in whom, and the <hi>Genevian</hi> Notes, we find Chriſt to be excluded from being the foundation of mans Election, and made to be an inferiour cauſe of ſalvation only. 6.

The Doctrine of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Crowly,</hi> imputing all mens ſins to <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> his ſilly defences for the ſame, made good by a diſtinction of <hi>John Verons,</hi> and the weakneſs of that diſtinction ſhewed by <hi>Campneys.</hi> 8. The Errours of the former Authors oppoſed by <hi>Campneys,</hi> his book in anſwer to thoſe Errours, together with his Orthodoxie in the point of univerſal Redemption, and what he builds upon the ſame. 9.

And to ſay truth, it was but time that they ſhould come to ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion in the points diſputed: there being ſome men who in the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, buſily ſtickled in the maintenance of <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrines. And thinking themſelves to be more Evangelical then the reſt of their brethren; they either took unto themſelves (or had given by others) the name of Goſpellers. Of this they were informed by the reverent Prelate, and right godly Martyr, Biſhop <hi>Hooper,</hi> in the Preface to his Expoſition of the ten Commandments: <hi>Our Goſpellors</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be better learned then the holy Ghoſt, for they wickedly attribute the cauſe of Puniſhments and Adverſity to Gods Providence, which is the cauſe of no ill, as he himſelf can do no ill: and over every miſchief that is done, they ſay it is Gods Will.</hi> In which we have the men and their Doctrine, how the name of <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers,</hi> and the reaſon why that name was aſcribed unto them. It is obſerved by the judicious Author of the Book, called, <hi>Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae Speculum,</hi> that <hi>Calvin</hi> was the firſt of theſe latter times, who ſearcht into the Counſels (the eternal Counſels) of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. And as it ſeems he found there ſome other <hi>Goſpel</hi> then that which had been written by the four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts: from whence his followers in theſe Doctrines had the name of <hi>Goſpellers:</hi> for by that name I find them frequently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Campneys</hi> alſo in an Epiſtolary Diſcourſe, where he clears himſelf from the crimes of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> which ſome of theſe new <hi>Goſpellers</hi> had charged upon him; which had I found in none but him, it might have been aſcribed to heat or paſſion in the agitation of theſe quarrels: but finding it given to them alſo by Biſhod <hi>Hooper</hi> (a temperate and modeſt man) I muſt needs look upon it as the name of the

Sect, by which they were diſtinguiſhed from other men.</p>
                     <p>2. And now I am fallen upon this <hi>Campneys;</hi> it will not be unneceſſary to ſay ſomething of him in regard of the great part he is to act on the ſtage of this buſineſs. Proteſtant he was of the firſt edition cordially affected to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the preſent points, but of a ſharp and eager ſpirit. And being not well weaned from ſome points of <hi>Popery</hi> in the firſt dawning of the day, of our Reformation, he gave occaſion unto ſome of thoſe whom he had exaſperated to inform againſt him, that they proſecuted the complaint ſo far, that he was forced to bear a faggot at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſs (as the cuſtome was in all ſuch caſes) <hi>Miles Coverdale,</hi> then or not long after Biſhop of <hi>Exon,</hi> preaching a Sermon at the ſame. But whatſoever he was then in other Doctrinals, he hath ſufficiently purged himſelf from the crimes of <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had been charged by thoſe of the adverſe party. For whereas one <hi>William Samuel</hi> had either preached or written<note place="margin">Anſwer to a certain letter. p. 3.</note> in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> time, <hi>That a man might deſerve God,</hi> &amp;c. Campneys <hi>beholds it for a doctrine ſo blaſphemous and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that neither Papiſts nor</hi> Pelagians, <hi>nor any other Heretick old or new hath ever written or maintained a more filthy and execrable ſaying. For it is the ſtat and manifeſt denying both of God the Father, and of his Son Chriſt Jeſus: neither doth it require any confutation to him that doth but confeſs that there is a God. And as for my ſelf,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I do not love my life ſo dearly, as I hate this vile ſaying deadly.</hi> He gives not long after to the Popiſh <hi>Pelagians</hi> the name of a <hi>filthy</hi> and <hi>deteſtable Sect.</hi> p. 5. muſtereth up all the errours of <hi>Pelagius,</hi> which had been publickly recanted in the Synode of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and falling upon that which teacheth, <hi>That the grace of God is given according unto our deſerving;</hi> he declares it to be vile and abominable, contrary to the manifeſt mind and words of the Apoſtle, <hi>p.</hi> 12. Finally, Not to trouble my ſelf with more particulars, encount<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ing with another of the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſies, he paſſionately cries out, <hi>O blaſphemy intollerable! O filthy puddle, and ſink most execrable! full of ſtinking Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, full of damnable preſumption, like to the pride of Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,</hi> moſt abominable, <hi>p.</hi> 15.!</p>

                        <pb n="4" facs="tcp:130574:119"/>3. This is enough to free this man from being either a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist</hi> or <hi>Pelagian</hi> Heretick, as his enemies made him. And for the other reproach which they laid upon him, of being an <hi>Enemy to Gods predeſtination,</hi> I conceive it will not be regarded as a matter of moment, conſidering the Diſputes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and the uſual acts of the <hi>Calvinians</hi> to defame their Adverſaries. We ſhewed before, how <hi>Bogerman, Paraeus,</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Sect, reproacht the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants</hi> with <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> in their publick writings, though as free from it as themſelves. We ſhewed before, how <hi>Croſs</hi> in the continuation of his <hi>Belgick</hi> Hiſtory impoſeth on them for ſome of their deteſtable opinions, that they made God to be the Author of ſin, and that he had created the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greateſt part of mankind to no other end, but to burn them in hell fire for ever: which horrid Blaſphemies they both abominated and confuted to their beſt abilities. The like unworthy practiſes, were uſed by <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> againſt <hi>Sebaſtian Caſtel.</hi> a man of no leſs learning, but of far more modeſty and moderation then either of them; whom they never left perſecuting and reviling, till they had firſt caſt him out of <hi>Geneva,</hi> and afterwards brought him to his grave. And this they did unto a man both of parts and piety upon no other pretence or provocation whatever, but becauſe he maintained another way of predeſtination then that which they had taught their followers for Gods Truth and Goſpel. And therefore it can be no wonder if the new <hi>Goſpellers</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> perſued the ſame courſes againſt all thoſe who oppoſed their fancies. For being governed by this ſpirit, they taxed their oppoſites ſometimes for being <hi>Haters of Gods Predeſtination,</hi> as before is ſaid, <hi>though intire</hi>

                        <hi>Lovers of the ſame,</hi> reviled them by the names of <hi>Popiſh Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians, and Juſtifiers of themſelves, imputing to thoſe men the whole maſs of Pelagianiſm, who from their very hearts and ſouls abhor'd all their wicked Opinions, and have been many years willing to beſtow their lives againſt all their abominable Errours.</hi> And ſometimes finally they call them <hi>Free-will men</hi> in contempt and ſcorn; deſigning by that name not the <hi>Papiſt</hi> only, but ſuch of their own mothers Children alſo, as taught that

                     <p>4. Which being ſaid, and the credit of the man ſet right, we may the better know what we are to truſt to in taking up ſome few following paſſages upon his Authority. Amongſt which I ſhall firſt begin with that of <hi>Knox,</hi> that great Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diary of the Nation and Kirk of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who in a book of his publiſhed in the end of King <hi>Edwards,</hi> or the beginning of Queen <hi>Marie</hi>'s Raign, againſt an Adverſary of Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, as the Title telleth us. Firſt builds the Doctrine of Predeſtination unto Gods abſolute Will, without relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to mans ſin or our Saviours ſuffering: and then aſcribes unto the predeterminate Counſel and Will of God all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane actions whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>In Reference to the firſt he was of their opinion plainly, who building upon the example of <hi>Eſau,</hi> exclude all that is in man either original ſin or actual, from the cauſe of Gods hate, which they lay on his own pleaſure only: which <hi>Knox</hi> endeavoureth to make good by this following Argument, <hi>p.</hi> 141.

                        </hi> was hated for his evil <hi>deſerving,</hi> then muſt needs follow, that <hi>Jacob was loved for his well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, the Argument following,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>by the Rule of</hi>

More copiouſly, but not more plainly, in another place, <hi>fol.</hi> 158. where it is affirmed, that whatſoever the Ethnicks and Ignorants did attribute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fortune, we Chriſtians do aſſign to the Providence of God, that we ſhould judge nothing of Fortune, but that<note place="margin">Id. <hi>p.</hi> 22.</note> all cometh by the determination of his Counſel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and finally that it diſpleaſeth him when we eſteem any thing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from any other: ſo that, (ſaith he) we not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and know him to be the principal cauſe of all things, but alſo the <hi>Author</hi> appointing all things to the one part, or to the other by his Counſel.

                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:130574:120"/>5. So able a Leader as <hi>John Knox</hi> could not want follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers<note place="margin">Id. <hi>p.</hi> 36.</note> of all Nations to attend upon him: in the Catalogue or liſt whereof, we muſt firſt look upon the Author of a Treatiſe written in <hi>French,</hi> and publiſhed afterwards in Engliſh, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>A brief Declaration of the Table of Predeſtination:</hi> in which it is affirmed expreſly, <hi>That ſeeing God who hath appointed the end, it is neceſſary alſo that he ſhould appoint the cauſes leading to the ſame end:</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid (ſaith <hi>Campneys</hi>) that as God hath appointed ſome man to be hanged, ſo he hath appointed him alſo to ſteal, as a cauſe lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame end, to which by God he is appointed. The ſame <hi>French Engliſh Author</hi> lets us know in another place,<note place="margin">P. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>That by vertue of Gods Will all things were made; yea even thoſe things which are evil and execrable:</hi> which execrable ſaying he endeavoureth to palliate with this diſtinction, <hi>That thoſe evil execrable things which are wrought by the vertue of Gods Will, are not evil and execrable, in that they are wrought by his divine Counſel:</hi> but for as much as they proceed from the Prince of the air. And as for the foundation of Election to eternal<note place="margin">P. 63.</note> life, he laies it not on the free Mercy of God in Chriſt, which he affirms to be no other, but an inferiour cauſe thereof; but teacheth us to aſcend unto an higher cauſe, that is to ſay, to the eternal purpoſe and predeſtination of God, which he determined only in himſelf. Conform to which we find in the <hi>Genevian</hi> Bibles this marginal Note, amongſt many others of like nature, <hi>viz. As the only Will and purpoſe of God is the chief cauſe of Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation;</hi> ſo his free mercy in Chriſt is an inferiour cauſe of ſalvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rom. 9.</p>
                     <p>6. In the next place comes out a Pamphlet, entituled <hi>againſt a privy Papiſt;</hi> the Author whereof takes upon him to prove this point, <hi>That all evil ſpringeth out of Gods Ordinance,</hi> or that Gods Predeſtination was the cauſe of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, and of all wickedneſs.

                     <p>Of which Sylogiſme <hi>Campneys</hi> very well obſerveth, that if the <hi>Major</hi> of it be underſtood of <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall, as by the <hi>minor</hi> it muſt be) then may it be affirmed alſo of any other, that whatſoever execrable wickedneſs is in him, the ſame is in him by Gods will and ordinance. But then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it might be asked, that ſeeing it is the decree, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance<note place="margin">Ibi. p. 43.</note> and will of God that man ſhould not ſin; How they ſhould creep into that <hi>ſecret councell,</hi> where God ordained, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and willed the contrary? The leader will come in to help his followers in the preſent plunge, for in his trayterous and ſeditious Libel, <hi>Againſt the Regiment of Women</hi> (which he calls, <hi>The first blaſt of the Trumpet</hi>) he knows not how to ſhift off the obedience due by Gods word to lawful Queens in their ſeverall Kingdoms, but by flying to ſome ſpeciall Revelation from his <hi>ſecret will</hi> not publikely communicated to the ſons of men: And this he ſpeakes not faintly, but with zeale and confidence, telling us how aſſured him, <hi>that God hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to ſome in our age, (that is to ſay, himſelfe and his Diſciples in the holy Presbytery) that it is more then a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in nature, that a Woman ſhould Rule and have Empire againſt man.</hi> And what could they doe leſs, upon this aſſurance, upon ſo plaine a Revelation of Gods ſecret will, then take up arms againſt their Queen, depoſe her from her throne, expell her out of her native Kingdom, and finally proſecute her to the very death. The Ladder which <hi>Constantine</hi> the great commended to <hi>Aſſeſius</hi> a <hi>Novatian</hi> Biſhop for his ſafer clim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to heaven, was never more made uſe of then by <hi>Knox</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> for mounting them to the ſight of Gods <hi>ſecret Councell,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">

God: And thereupon he doth inferre, that when a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor is hanged, for any of the facts before ſaid, he is hanged for <hi>nothing,</hi> becauſe the fact or deed is aſcribed to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſin only charged on him; which ſin being <hi>nothing</hi> in it ſelf, it muſt be <hi>nothing</hi> that the <hi>malefactor</hi> is condemned, or hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for.</p>

Certaine it is that they all ſpeak more plainly then their Maſter doth; as to the makeing of God to be the the Author of ſin; though none of them ſpeake any things elſe, then what may logically be inferred from his ground and principles. And by this book it appeareth alſo, how contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry theſe Doctrins are, to the eſtabliſht by the firſt Reformers in the Church of <hi>England;</hi> how contrary the whole method of Predeſtination out of which they flow, is to that delivered in the Articles, the Homilies, and the publick Liturgie, and witneſſed too, by ſo many learned men and godly martyrs, Which manifeſt deviation from the rules of the Church, as it gave juſt offence to all moderate and ſober men, ſo amongſt others unto <hi>Campneys</hi> before remembred; who could not but expreſs his diſlike thereof, and for ſo doing was tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for a <hi>Pelagian and a Papiſt,</hi> or a <hi>Popiſh Pelagian.</hi> For which being charged, by way of Letter, he was neceſſitated to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne an Anſwer to it which he publiſhed in the ſecond or third year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> In which Anſwer he not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleares himſelfe from favoring the <hi>Pelagian</hi> errors in the Doctrin of Freewill, Juſtification by works, &amp;c. but ſolidly and learnedly refuteth the opinions of certaine Engliſh Writers and Preachers; whom he accuſeth for teaching of falſe and ſcandalous Doctrin, under the name of <hi>Predeſtination;</hi> for his preparation whereunto he ſtates the point of univerſall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption<note place="margin">Ibi. p. 10.

Which preordaining unto ſin, as it doth neceſſarily infer the laying of a neceſſity upon all mens actions, whether good or bad, according to that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate Counſel and Will of God; ſo theſe good men, the Authors of the books before remembered, doe expreſly grant it, acknowldgeing that God doth not only move men to ſin, but compell them to it, by the inevitable rules of <hi>Predeſtination.</hi>

But if it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in favour of theſe two books, (that they were publiſhed by Authority and according to order; when that of <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,</hi> ſeems to have been publiſhed by ſtealth without the Name of Author or of Printer, as is affirmed in <hi>Verons</hi> booke before remembred; It may be ſince anſwered, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church was then unſetled, the Articles of K. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> time being generally conceived to be out of force, and no new eſtabliſhed in their place, when <hi>Veron</hi> firſt entered on the cauſe.

                     <p>I do not deny it, but he that firſt told you that matter might<note place="margin">Careleſe.</note> have found himſelf much better occupied.</p>

                     <p>Write that he ſaith otherwiſe he holdeth not (ſo that was written) It was told me alſo, that thou doſt affirme that Chriſt did not die effectually for all men.</p>
                     <p>Whatſoever hath been told you, is not much material, for<note place="margin">Careleſe.</note> indeed I do believe that Chriſt did effectually die for all thoſe, that do effectually repent and believe, and for none other; ſo that was written.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>How then?</p>
                     <p>I think he doth believe as your Maſterſhip, and the reſt of the Clergy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do believe of Predeſtination, that we be elect in reſpect of our good works, and ſo long elected as we do them, and no longer.</p>
                     <p>Yet thou cannot deny, but that you are at a jar amongſt<note place="margin">Martin.</note> your ſelves in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> and it is ſo throughout all your Congregation, for you will not be a Church.</p>
                     <p>No, Maſter Doctor, that is not ſo, there is a thouſand<note place="margin">Careleſe.</note> times more variety of opinions amongſt your Doctors, which you call, of the Catholick Church; yea, and that in the Sacrament, for the which there is ſo much blood ſhed now adayes. I meane, of your later Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:130574:125"/>
and new Writers; as for the old they agree wholly with us.</p>
                     <p>3. Now in this conference or examination there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things to be conſidered; For, firſt, I conſider <hi>Careleſe</hi> as a man unlettered, and not ſo thoroughly grounded in the conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as not to entertaine ſome thoughts to which the doctrine of this Church could afford no countenance. Amongſt which I reckon that ſtrong confidence which he had of his own ſalvation, and of the final perſeverance of all thoſe who are the choſen members of the Church of Chriſt, which was not taught him by the Church, and could not be obtained in any ordinary way, by the light of that doctrine which then ſhined forth unto the people. Secondly, I conſider him as one ſo far inſtructed in the knowledge of Predeſtination, as to lay the foundation of it on <hi>Gods great mercy,</hi> and <hi>infinite goodneſſe</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus; which plainly croſſeth with the new <hi>Goſpellers</hi> of thoſe times, who found the ſame upon his abſolute will and pleaſure, without relation to Chriſts ſufferings for us, or our faith in him. Thirdly, I conſider that the Doctrine of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Redemption,</hi> by the death of Chriſt, and the effectuality thereof to the ſons of men, was then ſo generally received and taught in the Reformed Church of <hi>England,</hi> as not to be known to Artificers, Tradeſmen, and Mechanicks; and that they were ſo well inſtructed in the nicities of it, as to believe that though Chriſt died <hi>effectually</hi> for all, yet the benefit thereof ſhould be <hi>effectually</hi> applied to none, but thoſe who do <hi>effectually</hi> repent. Fourthly, I conſider that if the Popiſh Clergy of thoſe times did believe no otherwiſe of Predeſtination, then that men be elected in reſpect of good works, and ſo long elected as they do them, and no longer, as <hi>Careleſe</hi> hath reported of them; the Doctrine of the Church hath been ſomewhat altered ſince thoſe times; there being now no ſuch Doctrine taught in the Schooles of <hi>Rome,</hi> as that a man continues no longer in the ſtate of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, then whileſt he is exerciſed in good works.

finally, I conſider the unfortunate eſtate of thoſe, who living under no certaine rule of Doctrine or Diſcipline, lie open to the practices of cunning and malicious men; by whom they are many times drawn aſide from the true Religion. For witneſſes whereof, we have <hi>Trew</hi> and <hi>Careleſe,</hi> above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; the one being wrought on by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> the other endangered by the <hi>Goſpellers</hi> or <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Sectaries; For that <hi>Careleſe</hi> had been tampered with by the Goſpellers, or <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Sectaries, doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> appear moſt clearly, firſt by the confidence which he had of his own ſalvation, and of the final perſeverance of all others alſo, which are the choſen members of the Church of Chriſt; and ſecondly, but more eſpecially, for giving the ſcornful title of a <hi>Free-will</hi> man to one of his fellow priſoners, who was it ſeemes of different perſwaſion from him.

without any ſenſible alteration in any of the Rubricks, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Contents thereof; but only the giving of ſome contentment to the Papiſts and all moderate Proteſtants in two particulars; the firſt whereof was the taking away of a clauſe in the Letany, in which the people had been taught to pray to Almighty God to deliver them <hi>from the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome, and all his deteſtable enormities.</hi> The ſecond was, the adding of the ſentences in the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament, <hi>viz.

                     <p>5. The next care was for making and perfecting thoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, of which we finde mention at the end of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> Book, <hi>for the neceſſary edifying of Chriſtian people, and the increaſe of godly living;</hi> both Books ſufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for (beſides the confirmation of that firſt Article of the year, 1552.) in the Rubrick of the ſecond Liturgie, where it is ſaid, <hi>that after the Creed, if there be no Sermon, ſhall follow one of the Homilies already ſet forth, or to be ſet forth by common authority;</hi> which Rubrick being reviſed with the reſt of the Liturgie, put the ſaid books of Homilies (as well the ſecond as firſt part of them) into the ſervice of the Church, and thereby made them no ſmall part of the publick doctrine; But who they were which laboured in this ſecond Book, whither they were the ſame that drew up the firſt, or thoſe who in <hi>Queen Elizab.</hi> time reviewed the Liturgie; or whether they were made by the one, and reviewed by the other, I have no where found, though I have taken no ſmall paines in the ſearch thereof. But thoſe few doctrinals which were contained in the Book of Common Prayer, or deducible from it, not being much took notice of; and the <hi>Homilies</hi> not confirm'd by that <hi>common Authority,</hi> which was required in the Rubrick, the <hi>Zuinglians</hi> or Goſpellers took the opportunity to diſperſe their doctrines, before the <hi>door of utterance</hi> ſhould be ſhut againſt them, or any publick courſe be taken to ſuppreſs their practices. And this they did with ſo much diligence and cunning, that they encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed exceedingly both in power and numbers; of which more hereafter. Notice whereof being took of thoſe which were of moſt Authority in the Government of the Church, it was thought neceſſary for the preventing of the miſchief which might thence inſue, that the Articles of Religion, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, 1552. ſhould be brought under

                     <p>6. And to this end a Convocation was aſſembled on the 13. of <hi>January, An.</hi> 1562. which continued t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

And being ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, preſented to the Queen, and ratified by her Royal Authority, were forthwith publiſhed to the ſame end for which they were made, that is to ſay, <hi>For the avoiding of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of opinions, and for the ſtabliſhing of conſent touching true Religion,</hi> as in the title is declared. In the compoſing of which Book, though a clauſe was added to the twentieth Article, and another taken from the third; though ſome Articles of King <hi>Edwards</hi> were totally omitted, and ſome new made (as that amongſt the reſt for confirmation of the ſecond Book of Homilies) which were not in the Book be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet the the five Articles touching the Doctrine of the Church in the points diſputed, as they ſtand in the eight Chapter of this Book, were left in that ſame ſtate in which they found them. And being left in the ſame ſtate in which they found them, were to be taken in the ſame ſenſe, in which they had been underſtood at the firſt making of them, according to ſuch illuſtrations as occur in the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer, ſuch Explanations as are found in the Book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> and the judgement of thoſe learned men and godly Martyrs, which had a principal hand in the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo that the Articles being the ſame as to theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, the paraphraſes of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſtate the ſame; the publick

Liturgie, and the firſt Book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> in all points the ſame; and the ſecond book of Homilies, agreeing exactly with the firſt in the preſent controverſies, as appears by the three firſt Sections of the ſeventh Chapter of this Book, and that which follows in the next; there is no queſtion to be made, but that the doctrine was the ſame in the ſaid five points, which had been publickly allowed of in the time of King <hi>Edward.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>7. But againſt this it may be ſaid, that one of the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Articles of King <hi>Edwards</hi> book (in reference to the points diſputed) was totally left out of this, and therefore that there was ſome alteration of the Churches judgement, as to the ſenſe and meaning of the preſent Articles, which Article being the tenth in number, as it ſtands in that Book, is there delivered in theſe words, <hi>viz. Gratia Chriſti ſeu ſpiritus ſanctus, qui per eundem datur, &amp;c.</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline margQuotes">'The grace of Chriſt, or the holy Ghoſt which is given by him, doth take from man the heart of ſtone, and giveth him a heart of fleſh: And though by the influences thereof, it rendreth us willing to do thoſe good works which before we were unwilling to do, and unwilling to do thoſe evil works which before we did; <hi>voluntati tamen nullam violentiam infert;</hi> yet is no violence offered by it to the will of man: nor can any man when he hath ſinned excuſe himſelf, <hi>quaſi nolens aut coactus peccaverit,</hi> as if he had ſinned againſt his will, or upon conſtraint, and therefore that he ought not to be accuſed or condemned upon that account.'</q> For anſwer whereunto it may firſt be ſaid, that the Compoſers of that Book, thought it not fit to clog it with any unneceſſary points in which the peace and ſafty of the Church ſeemeth not much concerned; and therefore as they left out the preſent Article, ſo they omitted the ſixteenth touching the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt, together with the foure laſt of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Book, touching the General reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, the ſtare of mens ſouls after death, the Doctrine of the Millinaries, and of a general ſalvation to be given to the wicked alſo, after they had endured the paines of hell

for a certain time. Secondly, they conſidered, that the doctrine of mans free Co-operation with the grace of God, had been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently expreſſed and provided for by the tenth Article of this Book, and the ninth of which illuſtrated by divers paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in the publick Liturgie, accommodated and applied to the moſt encreaſe of piety in the Book of <hi>Homilies:</hi> therefore that there was no great need to contend about it, or to retain it in the Book. And ſomewhat alſo muſt be done (the point being ſo ſecured and provided for, as before was ſaid) to content (the <hi>Zuinglians,</hi> or <hi>Calvinians,</hi> by which laſt name they were afterwards more generally called) who were grown ſtrong and numerous in moſt parts of the Realme: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that many of them did not refuſe to ſubſcribe the Book, and were complained of for that cauſe by the Prolocutor to the Houſe of Biſhops; deſiring that an order might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently made to cauſe them to ſubſcribe their names to the ſaid Article, either in their own houſe, or before their Lordſhips: which order being made on the fift of <hi>February,</hi> the Prolocutor ſignified to the Arch-Biſhop and Biſhops in the name of the lower Houſe of Convocation; that ſome of the Refuſers had ſubſcribed, and that others ſtill perſiſted in their former obſtinacy. And thereupon the Biſhops ordered the ſame day (the tenth of <hi>February) quod nomina eorum qui hactenus non ſubſcripſerant, preſententur coram iis in proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma ſeſſione;</hi> that is to ſay, that the names of ſuch who ſtill refuſed to ſubſcribe, ſhould be preſented to their Lordſhips at the next Seſſion; which put an end to the Diſpute, for after this I heare no more of their refuſals; the ſubſcription of the book being univerſal, as appears by this memorial in the jornal of that Convocation, <hi>viz. univerſus clerus eoſdem etiam unanimiter &amp; recepit &amp; profeſſus eſt, ut ex manuum ſuarum ſubſcriptionibus patet;</hi> that is to ſay, that all the Clergy did unanimouſly approve the ſaid Articles, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified their conſent therein, as by the ſubſcription of their hands doth and may appear; ſo difficult a thing it was from the firſt beginning to bring that violent and head ſtrong facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto any conformity.</p>

                        <hi>Powell</hi> Dean of Saint <hi>Pauls,</hi> who was Prolocutor in this Convocation, maintaineth in his Catechiſme a Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which the <hi>Arminians,</hi> as ſome call them, do now contend for; and that it is not to be thought, that he, and others engaged with them in the ſame convocation, were either <hi>ſo ignorant, as not to understand what they put into the Articles</hi> or ſo <hi>infatuated</hi> by God, to put in things quite contrary to their own judgements, which being ſuppoſed or took for granted, we are directed to his Catechiſme written in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> tongue, and dedicated from the two Arch-Biſhops from which the Objector hath abſtracted theſe two paſſages fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline margQuotes">'To the Church do all they properly belong, as many as do truly fear, honour, and call upon God, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether applying their mindes to live holily and godly, and with putting all their truſt in God, do moſt aſſuredly look for the bleſſedneſs of eternal life.

And to ſay truth, he could have no communion with the <hi>Arminians</hi> (as ſome pleaſe to call them) though he had deſired it; <hi>Arminius</hi> being not born, or but newly borne, when Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> wrote that Catechiſm; and Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> had been dead ſome years before the name of an <hi>Arminian</hi> had been heard in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>9. But unto this it hath been anſwered, that looking upon Mr. <hi>Powell,</hi> in his publick capacity, as he was Prolocutor to that Convocation, it cannot be denied, but that he was as like to underſtand the conduct of all affaires therein, as any other whatſoever; And yet it cannot rationally be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from thence, that therefore nothing was concluded
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:130574:129"/>
in that convocation, which might be contrary to his own judgement for a private perſon, admitting that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to <hi>Calvin</hi> in the points diſputed, as he was not nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For had he been of his opinion, the ſpirit of that Sects is ſuch as could not be reſtrained from charity it ſelfe dogmatical, and in termes expreſs; and not occaſionally on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and on the by (as in the Catechiſme now before us) and that too in full general termes that no particular concluſion<note place="margin">Juſtif. of the Fath. pref.</note> can be gathered from them. It hath been anſwered again thus, that the Articles in the five points, being the ſame with thoſe in King <hi>Edwards</hi> Book, and ſo confeſſed by the Objector; and no new ſenſe being put upon them by the laſt eſtabliſhment, they muſt be underſtood no otherwiſe then according to the judgement of thoſe learned men and godly Martyrs, before remembred, who had before concurred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the making of them, from which if Mr. <hi>Powells</hi> ſenſe ſhould differ in the leaſt degree, it is to be lookt upon as his own, not the ſenſe of the Church. And, thirdly, it hath been obſerved that the Catechiſme to which we are refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the former paſſages, is not the ſame with that, which is authorized to be taught in the Grammer Schools in Greek and Latine, nor the ſame which was publiſhed with the conſent of the Author in the Engliſh tongue, <hi>An.</hi> 1572. but a Catechiſme of a larger ſize, yet of leſſe authority, out of which the other was extracted; ſuch points as were ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and not well expreſſed, not being reduced into the ſame. And ſomewhat certainly there was in it, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred it uncapable of any further Editions, and not thought fit to be tranſlated into Latine, though ſuch a tranſlation of it was propounded to the Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle Dedicatory, to the ſhorter Engliſh. And though to let us know what Catechiſme it is he <hi>meanes,</hi> he ſeemes to diſtinguiſh it from the other, by being dedicated to the two Arch-Biſhops: Yet that doth rather betray the Objectors ignorance then advance his cauſe, the Authours one Latine Edition, and the Engliſh of it being Dedicated to the two Arch-Biſhops as well as that.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:130574:130"/>10. But ſince he hath appealed to the larger Catechiſme, to the larger Catechiſme let him go, In which he cannot ſo much as finde one ſingle queſtion touching the Doctrine of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> or the points depending thereupon: and therefore is neceſſitated to have recourſe unto the Articles of the Catholick Church, the members and ingredients of it, from whence he doth extract the two former paſſages. And then again, we are to note, that the firſt of the two paſſages not being to be found in the Latine Edition, nor the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tranſlation of the ſame, is taken almoſt word for word out of <hi>Powells</hi> Catechiſme, therefore to be underſtood in no other ſenſe then before it was, when it was peruſed and approved by the Biſhops and other learned men of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> time. And, thirdly, there is nothing in all that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, which juſtifieth the abſolute and irreſpective decree of the <hi>Predestinarians,</hi> or the reſtraining of the benefit of our Saviours ſufferings to a few particulars, nothing of Gods invincible working on the hearts of his choſen ones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the impoſſibility of mans co-operating any further in his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the death of ſin to the life of lighteouſneſs, then in that of his body from the grave to the life of glory; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that teacheth any ſuch certainly, or infallibly of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering in the faith and favour of God: as all the ſinnes of the world are not able to deprive them of it, but that they ſhal, muſt neceſſarily be brought again into the place and ſtation from which they had fallen. And as for the laſt of the ſaid two paſſages being the very ſame with that in the Authours Latine, and the Engliſh tranſlation of the ſame, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, which either a true Engliſh <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> or a Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> may not eaſily grant, and yet preſerve himſelf from falling into <hi>Calviniſme</hi> in any of the points diſputed. For granting <hi>that the Church is the univerſal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and fellowſhip of all the faithful whom God through Chriſt hath before all beginning of time appointed to everlaſting life;</hi> Yet muſt it ſo be underſtood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that either they were appointed to eternal life upon the ſuppoſition of their faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which may extend to the including of all thoſe who are called to the external participation of the Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments:

or elſe that it is meant ſpecially of ſuch as are appointed from all eternity to life everlaſting, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding any from the Dignity of being members of the Church, who have received the outward call, and openly joyne with them in all publick duties, and thereby paſs in common eſtimate amongſt the <hi>faithful</hi> believers; And then this definition will afford no comfort to our moderne <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> or create any inconvenience unto thoſe whom they call <hi>Arminians.</hi>

                        <q rend="inline margQuotes">'That as in <hi>Adam</hi> all men univerſally ſinned; ſo in <hi>Adam</hi> all men received the reward of ſinne, that is to ſay, became mortal and ſubject unto death, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in themſelves nothing but everlaſting condemnation, both of body and ſoul; that man being in this wretched caſe it pleaſed God to make a new Covenant with him, namely,

Nor, ſecondly, was this deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and redemption partial, intended onely for a few, but general and univerſal for all man-kinde; the ſaid Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily telling us not long after, that all this was done to the end the promiſe and covenant of God made unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Hom. p. 172.</note> and his poſterity concerning the <hi>Redemption of the world,</hi> might be credited and believed—<hi>to deliver man-kinde</hi> from the bitter curſe of the Law, and make perfect ſatisfaction by his death <hi>for the ſinnes of all people.</hi>'</q>—For the accompliſhment whereof, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'It was expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, ſaith the Homily, that our Mediatour ſhould be ſuch an one as might take upon him the ſins of mankinde, and ſuſtain the due puniſhment thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> death—<hi>'</hi>

In his diſcourſe upon which text, he firſt diſchargeth God from laying any neceſſity of ſinning on the ſons of men, and then delighting in their puniſhment becauſe they have ſinned: he thus breaks out againſt the abſolute decree of reprobation, which by that time had been made a part of the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> Goſpel, and generally ſpread abroad both from Preſſe and Pulpit. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'There is a conceit in<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Harnets</hi> Sermon at <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſs bound up at the end of Dr. <hi>Stewards</hi> three Sermons, print ed 1658. p. 133 <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </note> the world (ſaith he) ſpeaks little better of our gracious God then this, and that is, <hi>that God ſhould deſign many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of ſouls to hell before they were, not in eye to their faults, but to his own abſolute will and power, and to get him glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in their damnation.</hi> This opinion is grown high and monſtrous, and like a <hi>Goliah,</hi> and men do ſhake and tremble at it; yet never a man reacheth to <hi>Davids</hi> ſting to caſt it down. In the name of the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> we will encounter it, for it hath <hi>reviled</hi> not the Hoſt of the living God, but the Lord of Hoſts.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Firſt, that it is directly in oppoſition to this Text of holy Scripture, and ſo turnes the truth of God into a lye. For whereas God in this Text doth lay and ſweare, that he doth not delight in the death of man; this opinion ſaith, that not one or two, but millions of men ſhould frie in Hell; and that he made them for no other purpoſe then to be the children of death and hell, and that for no other cauſe but his meer pleaſures ſake; and ſo ſay, that God doth not onely ſay, but will ſweat to a lye. For the oath ſhould have runne thus, <hi>as I live (ſaith the Lord) I do delight in the death of man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Secondly, it doth (not by conſequence but) directly make God the Authour of ſin. For, if God without eye to ſin did deſigne men to hell, then did he ſay and ſet down that he ſhould ſinne: for without ſinne he cannot come to hell:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:130574:134"/>
And indeed doth not this opinion ſay, that the Almighty God in the eye of his Councel, did not only ſee, but ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould fall, and ſo order and decree, and ſet down his fall, that it was no more poſſible for him not to fall, then it was poſſible for him not to eat? And of that when God doth order, ſet down and decree, (I truſt) he is the Author, unleſs they will ſay, that when the Right honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Lord Keeper doth ſay in open Court, <hi>we order,</hi> he means not to be the <hi>Author</hi> of that his Order.</p>
                     <p>'Which ſaid, he tells us Thirdly, that it takes away from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> (in his ſtate of innocency) all freedom of Will and<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 135.</note> Liberty not to ſin. For had he had freedom to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Gods deſignment, <hi>Adams</hi> liberty had been above the deſignment of God. And here I remember a little witty ſolution is <hi>made,</hi> that is, if we reſpect <hi>Adams</hi> Will, he had power to ſin, but if God Decrees, he could not ſin. This is a ſilly ſolution; And indeed it is as much as if you ſhould take a ſound, ſtrong man that hath power to walk, and to lye ſtill, and bind him hand and foot, (as they do in <hi>Bedlam</hi>) and lay him down, and then bid him riſe up and walk, or elſe you will ſtir him up with a whip; and he tell you, that there be chains upon him, ſo that he is not able to ſtir; and you tell him again, that, that is no excuſe, for if he look upon his health, his ſtrength, his legs, he hath power to walk, or to ſtand ſtill; but if upon his Chains, indeed in that reſpect he is not able to walk. I truſt he that ſhould whip that man for not walking, were well worthy to be whipt himſelf: Fourthly, As God do abhor a heart, and a heart, and his ſoul deteſteth alſo a double minded man: ſo himſelf cannot have a mind and a mind; a face like <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> to look two wayes. Yet this opinion maketh in God two Wills, the one flat oppoſite to the other: An <hi>Hidden Will</hi> by which he appointed and willed that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould ſin; and an <hi>open</hi> Will by which he forbad him to ſin. His open Will ſaid to <hi>Adam</hi> in <hi>Paradiſe, Adam</hi> thou ſhall not eat of the Tree of good and evil: His <hi>Hidden Will</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt eat;</hi> nay, now I my ſelf cannot keep thee from <hi>eating,</hi> for my Decree from Eternity is paſſed, Thou ſhalt <hi>eat,</hi> that

Gods Glory in puniſhing ariſeth from his Juſtice in revenging of ſin: and for that it tells us, as I ſaid, a very ſad and unpleaſant tale; for who could digeſt it to hear a Prince ſay after this manner? I will beget me a ſon, that I may kill him, that I may ſo get me a name, I will beget him without both his feet, and when he is grown up, having no feet, I will command him to walk upon pain of death: and when he breaketh my Commandment, I will put him to death.

So that God delighteth to prepare neither death nor hell for damned men. The laſt branch of his diſcourſe he reſolves into ſix conſequences, as links depending on his chain; 1. Gods abſolute Will is not the cauſe of Reprobation, but <hi>ſin.</hi> 2. No man is of an abſolute neceſſity the child of Hell, ſo as by Gods grace he may not avoid it. 3. God ſimply willeth and wiſheth every living ſoul to be ſaved, and to come to the kingdom of Heaven. 4. God ſent his ſon to ſave every ſoul, and to bring it to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven. 5. God offereth Grace effectually to ſave every one, and to direct him to the Kingdom of heaven. 6. The neglect and contempt of this Grace, is the cauſe why every one doth not come to Heaven, and not any privative Decree, Councel and Determination of God.'</q> The ſtating and canvaſing of which points, ſo plainly, curtly to the Doctrines of the old <hi>Zuinglian Goſpellers,</hi> and the modern <hi>Calvinians;</hi> as they take up the reſt of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ſo to the Sermon I refer the Reader for his further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in them. I note this only in the cloſe, that there is none of the five <hi>Arminian</hi> Articles (as they commonly call them) which is not contained in terms expreſs, or may not eaſily be found by way of Deduction in one or more of the ſix conſequences before recited.</p>
                     <p>8. Now in this Sermon there are ſundry things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as namely, firſt, That the <hi>Zuinglian</hi> or <hi>Calvinian</hi> Goſpel in theſe points, was grown ſo ſtrong, that the Preacher calls it their <hi>Goliah;</hi> ſo huge and monſtrous, that many quaked and trembled at it, but none, that is to ſay, but few or none, <hi>vel d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, That in canvaſing the abſolute Decree of Reprobation, the Preacher ſpared none of thoſe odious aggravations which have been charged upon the Doctrines of the modern <hi>Calvinists</hi> by the Remonſtrants, and their party in theſe latter times. Thirdly, That the Sermon was preached at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſs,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:130574:136"/>
the greateſt Auditory of the Kingdom, conſiſting not only of the Lord Major, the Aldermen, and the reſt of the chief men in the City, but in thoſe times of ſuch Biſhops, and other learned men as lived occaſionally in <hi>London,</hi> and the City of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as alſo of the Judges and moſt learned Lawyers, ſome of the Lords of the Counſel being for the moſt part preſent alſo. Fourthly, That for all this we cannot find, that any offence was taken at it, or any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation enjoyned upon it, either by the high Commiſſion, or Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> or any other having authority in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nor any complaint made of it to the Queen, or the Counſel-Table, as certainly there would have been, if the matter of the Sermon had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Rules of the Church, and the appointments of the ſame. And finally we may obſerve, that though he was made Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Yorke</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Charls,</hi> 1628. when the times are thought to have been inclinable, to thoſe of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrines; yet he was made Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Pembrook</hi> hall, Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> and from thence tranſlated unto <hi>Norwitch,</hi> in the time of King <hi>James.</hi> And thereupon we may conclude, that King <hi>James</hi> neither thought this Doctrine to be againſt the Articles of Religion, here by Law eſtabliſhed, nor was ſo great an enemy to them, or the men that held them, as ſome of our <hi>Calvinians</hi> have lately made him.</p>

That the ſaid Mr. <hi>Harſnet</hi> was convented for this Sermon, and forced to recant it as heretical. 2. That upon this Sermon, and the controverſies that aroſe upon it in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> between <hi>Baroe</hi> and <hi>Whitacres,</hi> not only the Articles of <hi>Lambeth</hi> were compoſed (of which more hereafter) but Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> was appointed by the Univerſity to confute the ſame. 3. That the ſaid Sermon was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publiſhed or printed, that it was injoyned by Authority to be recanted. For Anſwer whereunto, it would firſt be known, where the ſaid Sermon was recanted, and by whoſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:130574:137"/>
Authority. Not in or by the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Harſnet</hi> lived both then, and a long time after; for the Sermon was preached at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſs, and ſo the Univerſity could take no cogniſance of it, nor proceed againſt him for the ſame. And if the Recantation was made at St. <hi>Pauls Croſs,</hi> where the ſuppoſed offence was given, if would be known by whoſe Authority it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned. Not by the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> in whoſe Dioceſs the Sermon was preached: for his Authority did not reach ſo far as <hi>Cambridge,</hi> whither the Preacher had retired after he had performed the ſervice he was called unto: And if it were injoyned by the High Commiſſion, and performed accordingly, there is no queſtion to be made, but that we ſhould have heard of in the <hi>Anti-Arminianiſm,</hi> where there are no leſs then eight leves ſpent in relating the ſtory of a like Recantation pretended to be made by one Mr. <hi>Barret</hi> on the tenth of <hi>May,</hi> 1595. and where it is affirmed, that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Harſnet</hi> held and maintained the ſame errors for which <hi>Barret</hi> was to make his Recantation. But as it will be proved hereafter that no ſuch Recantation was made by <hi>Barret;</hi> ſo we have reaſon to believe that no ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantation was impoſed on <hi>Harſnet.</hi> Nor, ſecondly; Can it be made good, that the Controverſies between Doctor <hi>Whitacres</hi> and Dr. <hi>Baroe</hi> were firſt occaſioned by this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or that Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> was appointed by the Univerſity to confute the ſame. For it appears by a letter written from the heads of that Univerſity to their Chancellour, the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> dated March 18. 1595. that <hi>Baroe</hi> had maintained the ſame Doctrines, and his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and Determinations above 14. years before, by their own account, for which ſee <hi>Chap. 21. Num.</hi> 80. which muſt be three years at the leaſt before the preaching of that Sermon by Mr. <hi>Harſnet.</hi> And though it is probable enough that Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> might give himſelf the trouble of confuting the Sermon, yet it is more then probable that he was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſo to do by that Univerſity. For if it had been ſo appointed by the Univerſity, he would have been reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it by the ſame power and authority which had ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:130574:137"/>
when he appeared a Candidate for the Profeſſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip on the death of <hi>Whitacres,</hi> but could not find a party of ſufficient power to carry it for him, of which ſee alſo <hi>Chap. 21. numb.</hi> 4. And thirdly, as for the not printing of the Sermon, it is eaſily anſwered; the Genius of the time not carrying men ſo generally to the printing of Sermons as it hath done ſince. But it was printed at the laſt, though long firſt: And being printed at the laſt, hath met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none ſo forward in the Confutation, as Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be, when at firſt it was preached.

But the beſt definition is, that in moſt of theſe threatnings there is a condition annexed unto them, either expreſt or underſtood, which is as the hinges to the<note place="margin">Jer 18</note> Doore, and turneth forward and backward the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

There were two parts of Gods purpoſe, the one diſcloſed, touching the ſubverſion of

                        <hi>Nineveh,</hi> the other of her converſion, kept within the heart of God. Whereupon he changed the ſentence pronounced, but not the councel whereunto the ſentence was referred. 3. If you conſider <hi>Niniveh</hi> in the inferiour cauſe, that is in the deſervings of <hi>Niniveh,</hi> it ſhall fall to the ground; but if you take it in the ſuperiour cauſe, in the goodneſſe and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of Almighty God, <hi>Niniveh</hi> ſhall eſcape. Laſtly, the judgement was pronounced with a condition reſerved in the minde of the judge, <hi>Niniveh</hi> ſhall be overthrown if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent not.

Philip</hi> threatned the <hi>Lacidemonians,</hi> that if he invaded their countrey, he would utterly extinguiſh them; They wrote him no other anſwer but this, <hi>If,</hi> meaning it was a condition well put in, becauſe he was never like to come amongſt them,
<q>Si niſi non eſſet, perfectum quidlibet eſſet.</q>
If it were not for conditions and exceptions, every thing would be perfect, but nothing more unperfect then <hi>Niniveh,</hi> if this ſecret condition of the goodneſs of God at the ſecond hand had not been.</p>

So far this Reverend Prelate hath diſcourſed of the nature of Gods decrees, and accommodated his diſcourſe thereof to the caſe of the <hi>Ninevites.</hi> Let us next ſee how far the principal particulars of the ſaid diſcourſe, and the caſe of the <hi>Ninivites</hi> it ſelf may be accommodated to the Divine decree of Predeſtination; concerning which the ſaid Reverend Prelate was not pleaſed to declare his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either as being impertinent to the caſe which he had in hand, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:130574:139"/>
thoſe learned Lectures, by which his judgment might be gueſſed at, though not declared. As Dr. <hi>Peter Baroe</hi> (of whom more hereafter) declared his judgement touching the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Decrees in the ſaid caſe of the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> before he fell particularly on the Doctrine of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> as he after did. And firſt, As for accomodating the caſe of the <hi>Ninevites</hi> to the matter which is now before us, we cannot better do it then in the words of <hi>Biſhop Hooper,</hi> ſo often mentioned; who having told us that <hi>Eſau</hi> was no more excluded from the promiſe of grace, then <hi>Jacob</hi> was, proceedeth thus, <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <q rend="inline margQuotes">'By the Scripture (ſaith he) it ſeemeth that the ſentence of God was given to ſave the one, and damne the other, before the one loved God, or the other hated him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit theſe threatnings of God againſt <hi>Eſau</hi> (if he had not of his wilful malice excluded himſelf from the promiſe of grace) ſhould no more have hindred his ſalvation, then Gods threatnings againſt <hi>Nineveh,</hi> (which notwithſtanding that God ſaid ſhould be deſtroyed within fourty dayes, ſtood a great time after, and did pennance. <hi>Eſau</hi> was circumciſed, and preſented unto the Church of God by his Father <hi>Iſaaac</hi> in all external Ceremonies as well as <hi>Jacob.</hi>'</q> And that his life and converſation was not as agreeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to juſtice and equity as <hi>Jacobs</hi> was, the ſentence of God unto <hi>Rebecca</hi> was not in the fault; but his own malice. Out of which words we may obſerve, firſt, that the ſentence of God concerning <hi>Eſau,</hi> was not the cauſe that his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation was ſo little agreeable to juſtice and equity; no more then the judgement denounced againſt the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> could have been the cauſe of their impenitency, if they had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in their ſinnes and wickedneſſes without repentance; contrary to the Doctrine of the <hi>Goſpellers</hi> in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, imputing all mens ſins to predeſtination. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Gods threatnings againſt <hi>Eſau</hi> (ſuppoſing them to be tanta-mount to a reprobation) could no more have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred his ſalvation; then the like threatning againſt the <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> could have ſealed to them the aſſurance of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſtruction; if he had heartily repented of his ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the <hi>Ninevites</hi> did. And therefore, thirdly, as well the decree
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:130574:140"/>
of God concerning <hi>Eſau,</hi> as that which is ſet out againſt the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> are no otherwiſe to be underſtood, then under the condition tacitly annexed unto them, that is to ſay, that the <hi>Ninevites</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed within fourty dayes, if they did not repent them of their ſinnes; and that <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould be reprobated to eternal death, if he gave himſelf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the luſts of a ſenſual appetite: Which if it be confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for true, as I think it muſt, then, fourthly, the promiſes made by God to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to all ſuch as are beloved of God, as <hi>Jacob</hi> was, and conſequently their election unto life eternal, are likewiſe to be underſtood with the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; that is to ſay, if they <hi>repent them of their ſinnes, and do unfainedly believe his holy Goſpell.</hi> The like may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed alſo in all the other particulars touching Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, with reference to the Doctrine of predeſtination, which are obſerved or accomodated by that learned Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in the caſe of the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> had I ſufficient time and place to inſiſt upon them.</p>

                                 <p>'3. As touching the Doctrine of <hi>Election</hi> (whereof this letter of Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> and many other of his Letters more<note place="margin">
                                       <hi>Fox</hi> in Acts &amp; Mon. fol. 1505</note> do much intreat) three things muſt be conſidered. 1. What Gods <hi>Election</hi> is, and what the cauſe thereof. 2. How Gods <hi>Election</hi> proceedeth in working our ſalvation. 3. To whom Gods election pertaineth, and how a man may be certaine thereof.—Between <hi>Predestination</hi> and <hi>Election</hi> this difference there is, <hi>Predeſtination</hi> is as well to the <hi>Reprobate</hi> as to the <hi>Elect, Election</hi> pertaineth onely to them that be ſaved. <hi>Predeſtination</hi> in that it reſpecteth the <hi>reprobate,</hi> is called <hi>reprobation;</hi> in that it reſpected the ſaved, is called <hi>Election,</hi> and is thus defined. <hi>Predeſtination</hi> is the eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creement of God, purpoſed before in himſelf, what ſhall befal all men either to ſalvation or damnation; <hi>Election</hi> is the free mercy and grace of God, in his own will through faith in Chriſt his Sonne, chooſing and preferring to life ſuch as pleaſeth him. In this <hi>definition</hi> of <hi>Election</hi> firſt goeth before (the mercy and grace of God) as the cauſes thereof, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are excluded all works of the Law, and merits of deſerving, whither they go before faith, or come after; ſo was <hi>Jacob</hi> choſen, and <hi>Eſau</hi> refuſed before either of them began to work, &amp;c. Secondly, in that the mercy of God in this <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition</hi> is ſaid to be (free) thereby is to be noted the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding and working of God not to be bound to any ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary place, or to any ſucceſſion of choice, nor to ſtate and dignity of perſon, nor to worthineſſe of blood, &amp;c. but
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:130574:142"/>
all goeth by the meere will of his own purpoſe, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>ſpiritus, ubi, vult ſpirat, &amp;c.</hi> And thus was the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward race and ſtock of <hi>Abraham</hi> after fleſh refuſed (which ſeemed to have the preheminence) and another ſeed after the Spirit, raiſed by <hi>Abraham</hi> of the ſtones, that is of the Gentiles. So was the outward Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and chaire of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which ſeem'd to be of price forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and Gods chaire advanced in other Nations. So was tall <hi>Saul</hi> refuſed, and little <hi>David</hi> accepted: the rich, the proud, and the wiſe of this world rejected, and the word of ſalvation daily opened to the poore, and miſerable Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the high mountaines caſt under, and the low val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys exalted, &amp;c.</p>
                                 <p>And in the next place it is added (<hi>in his own will</hi>) by this falleth down the free will, and purpoſe of man, with all his actions, councels, and ſtrength of nature: according as it is written, <hi>non eſt volentis, neque currentis, ſed miſeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Dei, &amp;c.</hi> It is not him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that ſheweth mercy. So we ſee how <hi>Iſrael</hi> ran long, and yet got nothing. The Gentile runneth, began to ſet out late, and yet got the game: So they which came at the firſt which did labour more, and yet they that came laſt were rewarded with the firſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. The work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will of the Phariſee ſeemed better, but yet the Lords Will was rather to juſtifie the Publican, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. The elder ſon had a better will to tarry by his father, and ſo did indeed; and yet the fat calf was given to the younger ſon that ran away, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. whereby we have to underſtand, how the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>goeth not by the will of man, but by the will of God as it pleaſeth him to accept,</hi> according as it is written, <hi>non ex vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate carnis, neque ex voluntate viri: ſed ex Deo nati ſunt, &amp;c.</hi> Which are born not of the will of the fleſh, nor yet of the will of man, but of God. Furthermore, as all then goeth by the will of God only, and not by the will of man: So againe, here is to be noted, that the will of God never goeth without faith in Chriſt Jeſus his Son.</p>
                                 <p>And therefore, fourthly, is this cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:130574:143"/>
Chriſt to us-ward maketh altogether. For, firſt, it certifieth us of Gods <hi>Election,</hi> as this Epiſtle of Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> doth well expreſſe: For whoſoever will be certain of his <hi>Election</hi> in God, let him firſt begin with faith in Chriſt, which if he finde in him to ſtand firme, he may be ſure, and nothing doubt, but that he is one of the number of Gods Elect. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the ſaid faith, and nothing elſe, is the only condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and meanes whereupon Gods mercy, grace, <hi>Election,</hi> vocation, and all Gods promiſes to ſalvation do ſtay ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly: the word of St. <hi>Paul, ſi permanſeritis in fide,</hi> and if ye abide in the faith, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 3. This faith is the mediate and next cauſe of our juſtification ſimply without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition annexed: For as the mercy of God; his grace, <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> vocation, and other precedent cauſes, do ſave and juſtifie us upon condition, if we believe in Chriſt: ſo this faith onely in Chriſt without condition, is the next and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſe, which by Gods promiſe worketh our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: according as it is written, <hi>crede in dominum Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum, &amp; ſalvus eris, tu, &amp; domus tua.</hi> Believe in the Lord Jeſus, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, thou and thy whole houſe. And thus much touching the <hi>Definition</hi> of <hi>Election,</hi> with the cauſes thereof declared, which you ſee now to be no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits or works of man, whither they go before, or come after faith. For like as all they that be borne of <hi>Adam,</hi> do taſte of his Malediction, though they taſted not of the Apple: ſo all they that be born of Chriſt (which is by faith) take part of the obedience of Chriſt, although they never did that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience themſelves, which was in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</p>
                                 <p>Now to the ſecond conſideration: Let us ſee likewiſe, how and in what order this <hi>Election</hi> of God proceedeth in chooſing and electing them which he ordaineth to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which order is this. In them that be choſen to life, firſt, Gods mercy and free grace bringeth forth <hi>Election: Election worketh Vocation,</hi> or Gods holy calling: which <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> though hearing bringeth knowledge, and <hi>faith</hi> in Chriſt: <hi>Faith</hi> through <hi>promiſe,</hi> obtaineth <hi>justification; jucti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> through <hi>hope,</hi> waiteth for <hi>glorification; Election</hi> is

us, being ſolicited with Gods mercy and <hi>election,</hi> that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever <hi>election</hi> goeth before, faith in Chriſt muſt needs follow after.

                                 <p>And therefore of election it is truly ſaid: <hi>de electione judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candum eſt a poſteriore,</hi> that is to ſay, we muſt judge of <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi> by that which cometh after, that is, by our faith and belief in Chriſt: which faith, although in time it followeth after election, yet this the proper immediate cauſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by the Scripture, which not onely juſtifieth us, but alſo certifieth us of this election of God; whereunto likewiſe well agreeth this preſent Letter of Mr. <hi>Bradford,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſaith: <hi>Election,</hi> albeit in God it be the firſt, yet to us it is the laſt opened.

And ſo I take my leave of our <hi>Martyrologiſt,</hi> the publiſhing of whoſe diſcourſe I look on as the firſt great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery which was made on the Bulwarks of this Church, in point of Doctrine by any member of her own, after the ſetling of the Articles by the Queens Authority, <hi>Anno</hi> 1562. the brables raiſed by <hi>Crowley</hi> in his Book againſt <hi>Campneys,</hi> though it came out after the ſaid Articles were confirmed and publiſhed, being but as haile-ſhot in compariſon of this great piece of Ordnance. Not that the Arguments were ſo ſtrong as to make any great breach in the publick Doctrine, had it been publiſhed in a time-leſſe capable of innovations, or rather if the great eſteeme which any had of that man, and the univerſal reception which his Book found with all ſorts of people, had not gained more authority unto his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, then the merit or ſolidneſſe of it could deſerve. The inconveniences whereof, as alſo the many marginal Notes and other paſſages, viſibly tending to faction and ſedition in moſt parts of that Book, were either not obſerved at firſt, or winked at in regard of the great animoſities, which were ingendred by it in all ſorts of people, as well againſt the perſons of the Papiſt, as againſt the doctrine; Inſomuch that in the Convocation of the year, 1571. there paſſed ſome Canons, requiring that not onely the Deanes of all Cathedrals ſhould take a ſpecial care, that the ſaid Book ſhould be ſo conveniently placed in their ſeveral Churches, that people of all conditions might reſort unto it; but alſo, that all and every Arch-Biſhop, Biſhops, Deans, Reſidentiaries, and Arch-Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons ſhould chooſe the ſame to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If it be her eupon inferred that <hi>Fox</hi> his doctrine was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by that Convocation, and therefore that it is agreeable to the true intent and meaning of the Articles of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> beſides what hath been ſaid already by Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may as logically be inferred, that the Convocation approved all his Marginal Notes; all the factious and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous paſſages; and more particularly the ſcorn which he puts upon the Epiſcopal habit and other Ceremonies of the Church. Touching which laſt (for the other are too many to be here recited) let us behold how he deſcribes the difference which hapned between <hi>Hooper,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> on the one ſide, <hi>Cranmer</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> on the other, about the ordinary habit and attire then uſed by the Biſhops of this Church, we ſhall finde it thus, <hi>viz.</hi>

The firſt was of the old and new <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who placed the cauſe of Gods <hi>Predeſtination</hi> in man, in that they hold, that God did ordain men to life or death, according as he did foreſee, that they would by their natural free-will, either reject or receive Grace offered. The ſecond of them, who (of ſome) are termed, <hi>Lutherans,</hi> which taught, that God foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all mankind being ſhut under unbelief, would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reject Grace offered, did hereupon purpoſe to chuſe ſome to ſalvation of his meer mercy, without any reſpect of their faith or good works, and the reſt to reject, being moved
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:130574:148"/>
to do this, becauſe he did eternally fore-ſee, that they would reject his Grace offered them in the Goſpel. The third of <hi>Semi-palagian Papists,</hi> which aſcribe Gods <hi>Predeſtination</hi> partly to mercy, and partly to mens fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen Preparations and meritorious works. The fourth, of ſuch as teach, that the cauſe of the execution of Gods <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> is his mercy in Chriſt in them which are ſaved; and in them which periſh, the fall and corruption of man; yet ſo as that the Decree and eternal Counſel of God concerning them both, hath not any cauſe beſides his Will and pleaſure.'</q> In which Preface whither he hath ſtated the opinions of the parties right, may be diſcerned by that which hath been ſaid in the former Chapters: and whither the laſt of theſe opinions aſcribe ſo much to <hi>Gods Mercy</hi> in Chriſt in them that are ſaved, and to mans natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Corruption</hi> in them that periſh, will beſt be ſeen by taking a brief view of the opinion it ſelf. The Author taking on him <hi>to oppugn the three firſt as erroneous,</hi> and only to maintain the laſt as being a truth, which will bear weight in the ballance of the Sanctuary, as in his Preface he aſſures us.</p>
                     <p>2. <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Now in this book Predeſtination is defined, to be the Decree of God, by the which he hath ordained all men to<note place="margin">Golden chain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                           </note> a certain and everlaſting Eſtate: that is, either to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or condemnation to his own Glory. He tells us ſecondly, that the means for putting this decree in execution, were the creation and the fall. 3. That mans fall was neither by<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 52.</note> chance, or by Gods not knowing it, or by his bare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, or againſt his Will; but rather miraculouſly, not without the Will of God, but yet without all approbation of it.'</q> Which paſſage being ſomewhat obſcure, may be explained by another, ſome leaves before. In which the Queſtion being asked, <hi>Whether all things and actions were ſubject unto Gods Decree?</hi> He anſwereth, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Yes ſurely, and therefore the Lord according to his good pleaſure hath moſt certainly decreed every both thing and action, whether paſt, preſent, or to come, together with their circumſtances of place, time, means, and end:'</q> And then the Queſtion

being preſt to this particular, <hi>What even the wickedneſs of the wicked?</hi> The anſwer is affirmative, <q rend="inline margQuotes">'Yes, he hath moſt juſtly decreed the wicked works of the wicked. For if it had<note place="margin">Ib. 29.</note> not pleaſed him, they had never been at all: And albeit they of their own natures are, and remain wicked, yet in reſpect of Gods decree they are to be accounted good.'</q> Which Doctrine, though it be no other then that which had before been taught by <hi>Beza,</hi> yet being publiſhed, more copiouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on, and put into a more methodical way, it became wondrous acceptable amongſt thoſe of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> party both at home and abroad, as before was ſaid. Inſomuch that it was printed ſeveral times after the Latin edition, with the general approbation of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches, and no leſs then 15. times, within the ſpace of twenty years in the Engliſh tongue. At the end of which term in the year 1612. the Engliſh book was turned by the Tranſlator into Queſtions and Anſwers, but without any alteration of the words of the Author, as he informs us in the laſt page of his Preface, after which it might have ſundry other impreſſions; that which I follow, being of the year 1621. And though the <hi>Supra-lapſarians</hi> or rigid <hi>Calviniſts</hi> (or <hi>Supra-creata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> rather, as a late judicious Writer calls them) differ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly in theſe points, from many of their more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate brethren, diſtinguiſhed from them by the name of <hi>Sub-lapſarians;</hi> yet in all points touching the ſpecifying of their ſeveral ſuppoſed Decrees, they agree well enough to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and therefore wink at one another, as before was noted.</p>
                     <p>3.

                              <desc>••</desc>

And hereof the firſt Author ſeems to be ſo confident, that he doth not only tell us, that this Recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made accordingly, but that it was not made with that <hi>Humility and Remorſe which was expected;</hi> it being ſaid, that after the reading thereof, he concluded thus, <hi>Haec dixi;</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating thereby, that he conſented not in his heart to that which he had delivered by his tongue. This is the total of the buſineſs concerning <hi>Barret</hi> in the <hi>Anti-Arminianiſm,</hi> in which there is ſomewhat to be doubted, and ſomewhat more to be denyed. And firſt it is to be doubted, whether any ſuch Recantation, conſiſting of ſo many Articles, and every Article having his abjuration or Recantation ſubjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto it, was ever enjoyned to be made: for though the Author of the book affirmeth in one place, that the whole Recantation, in the ſame manner and form <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> there we find it, was exemplified, and ſent unto him under the hand of the Regiſter of the Vniverſity, <hi>pag.</hi> 62. yet he confeſſeth within few lines after, that no ſuch matter could be found, when the heads of houſes were required by an Order from the houſe of Commons in the laſt Seſſion of Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. to make certificate to them of all ſuch Recantations as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in their Vniverſitie Regiſter, and of this Recantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in particular. And though it be hereupon inferred, that this Recantation was embezilled and razed out of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of the Vniverſity by ſome of the <hi>Arminian</hi> party, the better to ſuppreſs the memory of ſo great a foil; yet it may rather be believed, that many falſe Copys of it were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed abroad by thoſe of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> faction, to make the man more odious, and his opinions more offenſive then might ſtand with truth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:130574:153"/>9. The truth is that a Recantation was enjoyned, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to him, though not the ſame, nor in the ſame form and manner as before laid down; <hi>Barret</hi> confeſſing in his letters, of which more anon, that a Recantation was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on him and expected from him: But then it is to be denyed as a thing moſt falſe, that he never publiſhed the Recantation, whatſoever it was, which the heads enjoyned and required at his laſt convention. For, Firſt, It is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the Authors own Tranſcript of the Acts, that though he did confeſs the propoſitions wherewith he was charged to be contained in his Sermon; yet he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver grant them to be contrary to the Doctrine of the Church o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>England,</hi> and therefore was not likely to retract the ſame. Secondly, It is plain by <hi>Barrets</hi> ſaid letters, the one to Dr. <hi>Goad</hi> Maſter of <hi>Kings,</hi> the other to Mr. <hi>Chadderton</hi> Maſter of. <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge, that neither flattery, nor threatnings, nor the fear of looſing his ſubſiſtence in the Vniverſity, ſhould ever work him to the publiſhing of the Recantation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of him. And thirdly, It appears by the letters from the heads above mentioned to the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> that <hi>Barret</hi> had not made the Recantation on the 8th. of <hi>March,</hi> which was full ten moneths after the time appointed for the publiſhing of it. And on theſe terms this buſineſs ſheweth the Author his Errour, to affirm with all confidence, (for if the one doth, the other muſt) that <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> made this Recantation in St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church on the tenth of <hi>May, Anno 1595. Barret</hi> declaring in his letter to Dr. <hi>Goad,</hi> about nine moneths after, that he would never make it; And the heads ſignified to the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi> on the eight of <hi>March,</hi> being ten moneths after, that at that time he had not made. And who ſhould believe in the preſent caſe, <hi>Barret</hi> that ſaith he would never do it, and the heads, who ſay, he had not done it on the eight of March: or that they ſay upon the credit of a falſe and malitious Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py (purpoſely ſpread abroad by the <hi>Puritan</hi> faction to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame the man) that he had publiſhed it on the 10. of <hi>May,</hi> ten moneths before. I find alſo in the Title to this Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as it ſtands in the <hi>Anti-arminianiſm</hi> (p 46) that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:130574:153"/>
Mr. <hi>Harſnet</hi> of <hi>Pembrook</hi> Hall, is there affirmed to have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſuppoſed Errours, for which <hi>Barret</hi> was condemned to a Recantation: and 'tis ſtrange that <hi>Harſnet</hi> ſhould ſtand charged in the Title of another mans ſentence, for holding and maintaining any ſuch points as had been <hi>raked out of the dunghill of Popery and Pelagianiſm,</hi> as was there affirmed; for which he either was to be queſtioned in his own perſon, or not to have been condemned, to the Title of a ſentence paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on another man. Which circumſtance as it diſcredits the Title, ſo the Title doth as much diſcredit the reality of the Recantation, <hi>adeo mendaciorum natura eſt, ut cohaerere non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſint,</hi> ſaith <hi>Lactantius</hi> truly. The reſt of <hi>Barrets</hi> ſtory ſhall be told by himſelf, according as I find it in a letter of his to Dr. <hi>Goad</hi> then being Vice-Chancellour, written about nine moneths after the time of his firſt conventing: as the letter doth appear, which is this that followeth.</p>

For I required proof but of theſe two things

at his hands, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Una ſides</hi> did <hi>differre ſpecie ab alia;</hi> and that it was <hi>aliud donum ab alio,</hi> but he did neither.

And for the other, that it ſhould be <hi>Aliud donum,</hi> he proveth out of <hi>St. Auguſtine,</hi> that <hi>fides demonum</hi> is not <hi>alia a fide Chriſtianorum,</hi> which no man ever denyed: for <hi>fides Demonum</hi> is not <hi>Donum</hi> at all, ſo that it commeth not in Queſtion, ſo that I being here unſatisfied of one party, meaning Mr. <hi>Chadderion,</hi> and rather confirmed of the other party; I do hold my poſitions as before. And for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractation I purpoſe not to perform it: Yet that the peace of the Vniverſity, and the Church may be preſerved, I do ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly promiſe to keep my opinion to my ſelf: ſo that in this regard my humble ſuit unto your Worſhip (and hearty prayer to God) is this, that you would ſuffer me to continue in the Vniverſity without moleſtation, though I live but in diſgrace amongſt you, yet I regard it, ſo I may be quiet.

11. But here perhaps it may be ſaid, that though <hi>Barret</hi> might be as obſtinate in refuſing to publiſh the Recantation, as this letter makes him; yet it appears by the whole courſe of thoſe proceedings, that his Doctrines were condemned by the heads of the Vniverſity, as being contrary to that which was received and eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And that it was ſo in the Judgement of thoſe men, who either concurred in his cenſure, or ſubſcribed the letter to the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh</hi> above mentioned, in a thing paſt queſtion. But this can be no Argument, that <hi>Barrets</hi> Doctrines were repugnant to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe theſe heads either in favour of Dr. <hi>Whitacres,</hi> or in reſpect to Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> were pleaſed to think no otherwiſe of them: for if it be, we may conclude by the ſame Argument, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was in the right, even in the darkeſt times of ignorance and ſuperſtition, becauſe all thoſe who publickly oppoſed her Doctrines, were ſolemnly enjoyned by the then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing party to a Recantation; and which is more, it may be alſo thence concluded that the Doctrine maintained by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſius</hi> touching Chriſts Divinity, was contrary to that which had been taught by the Apoſtles, and men of Apoſtolical ſpirits, becauſe it was condemned for ſuch, by ſome <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Biſhops in the Councel (or rather Conventicle of <hi>Tyre</hi> which was held againſt him.</p>
                     <p>2. It cannot be made apparent that either Dr. <hi>Duport,</hi> the Vice-Chancellor who was moſt concerned, or Dr. <hi>Baroe,</hi> the Lady <hi>Margarets</hi> Profeſſour for divinity there had any hand in ſentencing this Recantation. Not Dr. <hi>Baroe,</hi> becauſe by concurring to this ſentence he was to have condemned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Nor Dr, <hi>Duport,</hi> for I find his place to be ſupplyed, and the whole action govern'd by Dr. <hi>Some</hi> (which ſhews him to be abſent at that time from the Vniver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> were generally thus enclined, yet probably the whole body of the Vniverſity might not be of the ſame opinion with them: tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

not daring to affirm otherwiſe of <hi>Barrets</hi> Doctrine in their letter to the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> then that it <hi>gave juſt offence to many.</hi> And if it gave <hi>offence</hi> unto many only, it may be thought that it gave no offence to the Major part, or much leſs to all; for if it had, the Writers of the letter would not have been ſo ſparing in their expreſſions, as to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the <hi>offence</hi> to <hi>many,</hi> if they could have ſaid it of the moſt.

Of which opinion <hi>Harſnet</hi> was, we have ſeen before. And we have ſeen before that <hi>Baroe</hi> had many Diſciples and Adherents which ſtood faſt unto him. And thereupon we may conclude, that when <hi>Dr. Baroe</hi> had for 14 or 15. years maintained theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> opinions in the Schools (as before was ſhewed) which are now novelized by the name of <hi>Arminianiſm;</hi> and ſuch an able man as <hi>Harſnet</hi> had preached them without any Controul, when the greateſt audience of the Kingdom did ſtand to him in it. There muſt be many more <hi>Barrets</hi> who concurred with the ſame opinions with them in the Vniverſity, though their names through the envy of the times are not come unto us.</p>

For what autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity could there be in ſo thin a meeting conſiſting only of the Arch-biſhop himſelf, two other Biſhops (of which but one had actually received conſecration) one Deane and half a dozen Doctors and other Miniſters, neither impowred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to any ſuch thing by the reſt of the Clergy, nor authorized to it by the Queen. And therefore their determinations of no more Authority, as to binding of the Church, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing to the judgement of particular perſons, then as if
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:130574:157"/>
one Earl, the eldeſt ſon of two or three others, meeting with half a dozen Gentlemen in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall, can be affirmed to be in a capacity of making orders which muſt be looked on by the Subject, as Acts of Parliament. A Declaration they might make of their own opinions, or of that which they they thought fitteſt to be holden in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, but neither Articles nor Canons to direct the Church: for being but opinions ſtill, and the opinions of private and particular perſons, they were not to be looked upon as publick Doctrines. And ſo much was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the Arch-Biſhop himſelf, when he was called in queſtion for it before the Queen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who being made acquainted with all that paſſed by the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burleigh,</hi> who neither liked the Tenents, nor the manner of proceeding in them, was moſt paſſionately offended that any ſuch Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be made in the publick Doctrine of this Church; and once reſolved to have them all attainted of a <hi>Premunire.</hi> But afterwards upon the interpoſition of ſome friends, and the reverend eſteem ſhe had of the excellent Prelate, the Lord Arch-Biſhop (whom ſhe commonly called her <hi>Black Husband</hi>) ſhe was willing to admit him to his defence: and he accordingly declared in all humble manner, that he &amp; his aſſociates had not made any Articles, Canons or decrees with an intent, that they ſhould ſerve hereafter for a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule to direct the Church, but only had reſolved on ſome propoſitions to be ſent to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> for the appeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome unhappy differences in the Vniverſity; with which Anſwer her Majeſty being ſomewhat pacified, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded notwithſtanding that he ſhould ſpeedily recall and ſuppreſs thoſe Aricles which was performed with ſuch care and diligence, that a Copy of them was not to be found for a long time after. And though we may take up this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the credit of hiſtory of the <hi>Lambeth</hi> Articles printed in Latin, 1651. or on the credit of Biſhop <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague,</hi>

In which they ſignifie unto him, that the ſaid Articles being agreed upon, and ready to be publiſhed, it pleaſed Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous memory, upon notice given how little they agreed with the practiſe of piety and obedience to all Government, to cauſe them to be ſuppreſſed, and that they had ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ever ſince, till then of late ſome of them had received countenance at the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi>

                     <p>4. Next touching the effect produced by them in order to the end ſo propoſed, ſo far they were from appeaſing the preſent Controverſies, and ſuppreſſing <hi>Baroe,</hi> and his party, that his Diſciples and Adherents became more united, and the breach wider then before. And though <hi>Dr. Baroe</hi> not long after, deſerted both his place in the Vniverſity, yet neither was he deprived of his Profeſſorſhip, as ſome ſay, nor forced to leave it on a fear of being deprived, as is ſaid by others: For that Profeſſorſhip being choſen from two years to two years, according to the Statutes of the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> he kept the place till the expiring of his term, and then gave off without ſo much as ſhewing himſelf a ſuiter for it: Which had he done, it may be probable enough, that he had carried it from any other Canditate or Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of what rank ſoever. The <hi>Anti-Calvinian</hi> party being grown ſo ſtrong, as not to be eaſily overborn in a publick buſineſs by the oppoſite faction. And this appears plainly by that which followed on the death of Dr. <hi>Whitacres,</hi> who died within few dayes after his return from <hi>Lambeth,</hi> with the nine Articles ſo much talkt of. Two Candidates appeared for the Profeſſorſhip after his deceaſe, <hi>Wotton</hi> of <hi>Kings</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a profeſſed <hi>Calvinian,</hi> and one of thoſe who wrote againſt <hi>Mountagues</hi> Appeal, <hi>Anno</hi> 1626.

To the advancement of which work, as the long continuance of <hi>Baroe</hi> in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, for the ſpace of 20. years and upwards, the diſcreet Activity of Dr. <hi>Harſnet,</hi> Fellow and Maſter of <hi>Pembrook</hi> Colledge for the term of 40. years and more, gave a good encouragement; ſo the invincible conſtancy of Mr. <hi>Barret,</hi> and the ſlender oppoſition made by <hi>Overald,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the confirmation and increaſe thereof.

But ſo it hapned, notwithſtanding that <hi>Overald</hi> not concurring with the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> concerning the eſtate of ſuch juſtified perſons as afterwards fell into grievous ſins; there grew ſome diffidences and diſtruſt between them, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards widned themſelves into greater differences.

                     <p>7. At <hi>Oxford</hi> all things in the mean time were calm and quiet, no publick oppoſition ſhewing it ſelf in the Schooles or Pulpits.

Article, where it is ſaid, <hi>That after we have received the Holy Ghoſt, we may depart from Grace.</hi> The meaning whereof, though he acknowledged to be ſound, yet he deſired, that becauſe they may ſeem to be contrary to the Doctrine of Election and Predeſtination in the 17th.

                           <note place="margin">Con. p. 19</note> took occaſion to ſignifie to his Majeſty, how very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in theſe dayes neglecting holineſs of life preſumed too much of perſiſting in Grace, laying all their Religion upon Predeſtination, If I ſhall be ſaved, I ſhall be ſaved, which he termed a <hi>deſperate Doctrine,</hi> ſhewing it to be contrary to good divinity, and the true Doctrine of Predeſtination, wherein we ſhould rather reaſon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendendo</hi> then <hi>Diſcendendo;</hi> thus, I live in obedience to God, in love with my neighbour, I follow my oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore I truſt God hath elected me, and predeſtinated me to ſalvation; not thus which is the uſual courſe of argument, God hath predeſtinate and choſen me to life, therefore though I ſin never ſo grievouſly, yet I ſhall not be damned, for whom he once loveth, he loveth to the end. Whereupon he ſhewed his Majeſty out of the next Article, what was the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> touching predeſtination in the very laſt Paragraph, <hi>ſcilicet, We muſt receive Gods promiſes in ſuch wiſe as theſe be generally ſet forth to us in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in all our doings the Will of God to be followed which we have delivered to us in holy Scripture.</hi> Which part of the Article his Majeſty very well approved, and after he had, (according to his manner) very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly diſcourſed on that place of <hi>Paul, Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trembling:</hi> he left it to be conſidered, wither any thing were not to be added for the clearing of the Doctors doubt, by putting in the word <hi>often,</hi> or the like: as thus, <hi>We may often depart from Grace,</hi> but in the mean time wiſhed that the Doctrine of Predeſtination might be very tenderly handled, and with great diſcretion, leſt on the one ſide Gods omnipotency

might be called in queſtion, by impeaching the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his eternal Predeſtination, or on the other a deſperate Reſumption might be arreared by inferring<note place="margin">Ib p. 43</note> the neceſſary certainty of ſtanding and perſiſting in grace. After which, upon occaſion of Dr. <hi>Overals</hi> diſcourſe concerning his affairs at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> his Majeſty entred into a longer diſcourſe of Predeſtination and Reproation then before, and of the neceſſary conjoyning Repentance and holineſs of life with true faith; concluding that it was Hypocryſie, and not true juſtifying faith which was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from them. For although Predeſtination and Election depend not upon any Qualities, Actions, or works of men, which be mutable, but upon Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and immutable decree and purpoſe; yet ſuch is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Repentance after known ſins committed, as that without it there could not be either Reconciliation with God, or remiſſion of thoſe ſins.'</q>

the Church of <hi>Ireland,</hi> though the ſaid Confeſſion was ſubſcribed in his name by the Lord Deputy <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> is plainly enough not without his conſent: for many other things were in the Confeſſion to which the Lord Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſubſcribed, and the King conſented as affairs then ſtood, which afterwards he declared no great liking to, either of the Tenor or effect thereof. For the truth is, that the drawing up of that confeſſion being committed principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the care of Dr. <hi>Uſher,</hi> and afterwards Lord Primate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> a profeſſed <hi>Calvinian,</hi> he did not only thruſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it all the <hi>Lambeth</hi> Articles, but alſo makes others of his own opinions: as namely, That the Pope was Anti-Chriſt, or that <hi>man of ſin,</hi> that the power of ſacerdotal Abſolution is no more then <hi>declatory,</hi> as alſo touching the morality of the Lords day Sabboth, and the total ſpending of it in religious Exerciſes: Which laſt how contrary it is to King <hi>Jame</hi>'s Judgement, how little cauſe he had to like it, or rather how much reaſon he had to diſlike it, his Declaration about <hi>Lawfull ſports,</hi> which he publiſhed within three years after, doth expreſs ſufficiently; ſo that the King might give conſent to the confirming of theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles amongſt the reſt, though he liked as little of the one as he did of the other: And he might do it on theſe Reaſons. For firſt, The <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation at that time were moſt tenaciouſly addicted to the errors and corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore muſt be <hi>bended</hi> to the other extream before they could be ſtreight, and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox in theſe ponits of Doctrine.

For I would fain know by what Authority thoſe Queſtions and Anſwers were added to the end of the Bible? If by Authority, and that ſuch Authority can be produced, the Argument will be of force which it takes from them, and then no queſtion but the ſame Authority by which they were placed there at firſt, would have preſerved them in that place for a longer time then during the ſale of that Edition: The not retaining them in ſuch Editions as have followed ſince the ſale of that, ſhews plainly that they were of no authority in themſelves, nor intended by the Church for a rule to others: and being of no older ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the year 1607.

In which it is firſt to be obſerved, that no offence was taken at the firſt part of his Sermon, in which he went no further then <hi>Dr. Overal</hi> had gone before, as in our laſt chap. Numb. 6.

For that King <hi>James</hi> condemned not the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrines in themſelves, though he had taken ſome diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt their perſons, as is ſaid before, appears not only by rejecting the <hi>Lambeth</hi> Articles, and his diſlike of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian</hi> Doctrine of Predeſtination, in the conference at <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> Court, but alſo by inſtructing his Divines commiſſionated for the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> not to oppoſe the Article of <hi>Univerſal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> which they accordingly performed.

But little or nothing being done in purſuance of them, the <hi>Predeſtinarian</hi> doctrines came to be the ordinary Theam of all Sermons, Lectures and Diſputations, partly in regard that Dr. <hi>Prideaux</hi> who had then newly ſucceeded Dr. <hi>Rob.

And yet being carefull that the truth ſhould not fair the worſe for the men that taught it, he gave command to ſuch Divines as were commiſſionated by him to attend in the Synod of <hi>Dort, Anno</hi> 1618. not to recede from the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the point of univerſal Redemption by the death of Chriſt.

But this together with the reſt being condemned in the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and that Synod highly magnified by the Engliſh <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> they took confidence of making thoſe diſputes the Subject of their common diſcourſes, both from the Pulpit and preſs, without

And thereupon it pleaſed his Majeſty, having now no further fear of any dangers from beyond the ſeas, to put ſome <hi>water into their wine,</hi> or rather a <hi>Bridle into their mouths</hi> by publiſhing certain orders and directions touching Preachers and preaching, bearing date on the 4. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1622.

with an intent to proſecute the ſame in the following Seſſion. A Copy whereof being come into <hi>Mountagues</hi> hands, he flies for ſhelter to King <hi>James,</hi> who had a very great eſtimation of him for his parts and learning, in which he had over-maſtred, they then though much leſs <hi>Selden</hi> at his own <hi>Philologie.</hi> The King had already ſerved his own turn againſt the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> by the Synod of <hi>Dort,</hi> and thereby freed the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi> his moſt dear Confederate from the danger of <hi>Barnwell,</hi> and his faction. Arch-Biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> came not at him ſince the late deplorable misfortune which befell him at <hi>Branzil,</hi> and the death of Dr. <hi>James Mountague</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Winton</hi> left him at liberty from many importunities and ſollicitations with which before he had been troubled; ſo that being now maſter of himſelf, and governed by the light of his own moſt clear and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellent Judgement, he took both <hi>Montague,</hi> and his Doctrines into his Protection, gave him a full diſcharge, or <hi>quietus eſt,</hi> from all thoſe Calumnies of <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> which by the ſaid Informers were laid upon him; incouraged him to procecd in finiſhing his juſt Appeal, which he was in hand with; commanded Dr. <hi>Francis White,</hi> then lately preferred by him to the Deanry of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and generally magnified not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for his zeal againſt Popery, to ſee it licenſed for the Preſs, and finally gave order unto <hi>Mountague</hi> to dedicate the book (when printed) to his Royal ſelf. In obedience unto whoſe Command the Dean of <hi>Carliſle</hi> licenſed the book with this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, <hi>That there was nothing contained in the ſamo, but what was agreeable to the publick Faith, Doctrine and Diſcipline eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church of</hi> England.

                     <p>12.

For eſtabliſhing the peace and quiet of the Church of</hi> England: by which he interdicted all ſuch preaching and printing as might create any freſh Diſturbance to the Church of <hi>England:</hi> or for his ſmart Anſwer to the part of the <hi>Remonstrance</hi> of the houſe of Commons, <hi>Anno</hi> 1628. which concerned the danger like to fall on this Church and Kingdom, by the grouth of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> or of the Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on prefixed before the book of Articles in the ſame year alſo, for ſilencing the ſaid Diſputes, or finally of his Majeſties Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, bearing date, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 30. 1629. for cauſing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the Declaration to be put in execution, and punctually obſerved for the time to come. By means whereof, and many fair encouragements from many of our Prelates, and other great men of the Realm, the <hi>Anti-Calviniſt</hi> party became con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable both for power and number.</p>

            <head>A POSTSCRIPT To the READER. Concerning ſome particulars in a ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous Pamphlet intituled A Review of the <hi>Certamen Epiſtolare, &amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Rimâ dicta mihi ſummâ dicenda camaenâ,</hi> with thee good Reader I began, and with thee I muſt end. I gave thee notice in the Preface of a ſcurrilous Libel, the Author whereof had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorged his foul ſtomack on me, and ſeemed to <hi>Glory</hi> in the <hi>ſhame.</hi> But whither this Authour be a <hi>Cerberus</hi> with three heads, or a <hi>Smert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnuus</hi> with fire, or but a ſingle <hi>Shimi</hi> only (for it is differently reported) is all one to me, who am as little troubled with the noiſe of <hi>Billings-gate,</hi> as the
<pb facs="tcp:130574:173"/>
cry of an <hi>Oyſter-wife.</hi> It is my confidence that none of the <hi>dirt,</hi> which he moſt ſhamefully<note place="margin">p. 175.</note> confeſſeth himſelf to have thrown in my face will be found upon it, notwithſtanding that <hi>neceſſe eſt ut aliquid haereat</hi> may be ſometimes true. Omitting therefore the conſideration of his many Obſcaenities which every where are intermingled for the floures of his Rhetorick, I cannot but do my ſelf ſo much juſtice, as to ſatisfie the Reader in the truth of ſome things, which otherwiſe may be beleeved to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. I am content to ſuffer under as much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquie as any foule mouthed Presbyterian can ſpit upon me; but I am not willing to be thought a ſlanderer, a profane perſon, or ungrateful for the ſmalleſt favours; all which the Authour of that ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous pamphlet hath impoſed upon me.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place it is much laboured to make me guilty of ingratitude and diſaffection to <hi>Magd. Coll.</hi> of which I had the honour to be once a member, and do retain ſo high an eſtimation of it, that whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I ſhall write or ſpeak any thing to the reproach of that foundation, <hi>let my tongue cleave unto the roof</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 22.</note> 
               <hi>of my mouth, and my right hand forget its cunning.</hi> But I am able to diſtinguiſh between the duty I owe to the Houſe it ſelfe, and that which every member of it is to challenge from me, (<hi>quid civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati, &amp; quid civibus debeam</hi> in the Orators <hi>Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme</hi>) And therefore I would not have the Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler or his partners think that his or their taking Sanctuary under the name of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge ſhall ſo far priviledge them in their actings (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt the Church in general, or my own
<pb facs="tcp:130574:173"/>
particular) but that I ſhall as boldly venture to <hi>attacque</hi> them there; without fear of ſacriledge, as <hi>Joab</hi> was ſmitten by <hi>Benaiah</hi> at the hornes of the Altar.</p>
            <p>But the beſt is that I am made to have ſome ground for my diſaffection, though there be no leſſe falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in the <hi>fundamentals</hi> then the <hi>ſuperſtructure.</hi> And a fine tale is told of ſome endeavours by me uſed for bringing one of my own <hi>brood</hi> into that <hi>foundation;</hi> the failing of which hopes muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity occaſion ſuch an undervaluing of that Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<note place="margin">p. 22.</note> as to change it from a <hi>neſt of Sparrows to a neſt of Cuckoes.</hi> But the truth is, that the party for whom I was a ſuitor, was ſo farre from being one of my own brood, as not to be within the compaſſe of my <hi>Relations;</hi> ſo much a ſtranger to my blood that he was no otherwiſe endeared un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, then by the extraordinary opinion which I had of his parts and induſtry. And therefore I commended him no further unto Doctor <hi>Goodwin,</hi> then that it was not my deſire to have him cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, if any abler Schollar ſhould appeare for the place. And it was well for the young man that I ſped no better; <hi>Periiſset niſi Periiſſet,</hi> as we knowe who ſaid. For within leſſe then two years after he was elected into the Society of <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge (to their great honour be it ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) upon no other commendation then his owne abilities.<note place="margin">p. 67.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the next place I am made a ſlanderer for ſaying, that the <hi>new Sabbath ſpeculations of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> Bound <hi>and his adherents had beene embraced</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:130574:174"/>
               <hi>more paſsionately of late then any one Article of Religion here by Law establiſhed.</hi> How ſo? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſaith he (or they 'tis no matter which) it is well known that they do more <hi>paſſionately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the great truths of Chriſts Divinity, and the Divine Authority of Scripture, &amp;c. then any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion about the Sabbath.</hi> What may be meant by the, &amp;c. it is hard to ſay, perhaps the <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian Diſcipline,</hi> or the <hi>Calvinian</hi> Doctrines of <hi>Predeſtination;</hi> the two deare <hi>Helena</hi>'s of the Sects as ſacred and inviolable in their eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as any of their new opinions about the Sabbath. But whether the <hi>great truths of Christs Divinity, the Divine Authority of Scipture,</hi> or any Article of Religion here by Law eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be embraced by them with the like paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as their new <hi>Saint Sabbath;</hi> may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by that impunity which is indulged by them to all Anabaptiſts, Familiſts, Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Quakers, and all other Sectaries. By whom the <hi>great Truths of Chriſts Divinity, and the Divine Authority of holy Scripture,</hi> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith have beene called in queſtion. And yet we cannot chooſe but know with what ſeverity they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded when they were in power againſt all perſons whatſoever whom they found travelling on the <hi>Sunday,</hi> though their buſineſſe was of more concernment to them then the <hi>lifting of the Oxe or Aſſe out of the ditch.</hi> With what a curſed rigour a Victualler hath beene forced to pay ten ſhillings for ſelling a half-penny loafe
<pb facs="tcp:130574:174"/>
to a poore man in the time of Sermon; What penalty they procured to be ordained againſt Vintners, Taylors, Barbers, for ſelling but a pint of Wine, or carrying home a new ſuit of Cloathes, or trimming the man that was to wear them on their Sabbath day: And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, againſt all perſons whatſoever for walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the fields or ſtreetes after all the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick duties of the day were ended. They may tell tell me what they will of their <hi>giving the Right hand of Fellowſhip</hi> to ſome Divines of <hi>Tranſmarine</hi> Churches, who differ in that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from them. But <hi>quid verba audiam cum</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>facta videam,</hi> the bleating of the ſheep, and the lowing of the Oxen will not out of my eares, though preferred under a pretence of making them an <hi>acceptable Sacrifice</hi> to the Lord their God.</p>
            <p>But the maine endeavour of the Pamphlet is to bring me under the reproach of a Propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in uſing ſuch words unto the King in a Petition of mine preſented to him, as it could not without ſinne be applyed unto any but to God. A greater crime then any of the other two, and as falſely charged. It is ſuggeſted in the Libell, that upon the ſenſe of ſome indignity which was offered to me, in being diſturbed in my poſſeſſion of a Lodging in <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, I made complaint unto the King of the <hi>great wrong which had been done his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties creature, and the workmanſhip of his hands,</hi> and that for this expreſſion I was checked by the
<pb facs="tcp:130574:175"/>
Marqueſſe of <hi>Hertford,</hi> who was then Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of that Univerſity; for proofe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are referred to ſomewhat which was ſaid in the Burſery of that Colledge before two of the fellows.</p>
            <p>But firſt I hope that all things which we ſaid in the Burſery before any two or more of the Fellows
<q>(—<hi>Ecce inter pocula quaerant Romalides Saturi, &amp;c.</hi>—)</q>
muſt not paſſe for Goſpel, nor that all Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talk, fit onely for the Voider, when the meale is done, is to be preſerved upon Record for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Truths. Secondly, I am confident as I can be of any thing ſo long ſince done, that no ſuch expreſſion ever paſſed my pen, there being no viſible neceſſity to inforce me to it. I Conceive, Thirdly, that the Libeller cannot be ſo much a Stranger to the Aſſembly Notes, on the 1. of <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. as not to know (if he had learnt it no where elſe) <hi>that it is a familiar phraſe, in the Style of the Court, to ſay ſuch an one was</hi> created <hi>Earle, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe, or Duke, &amp;c.</hi> upon which ground the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Houſe of Peeres were looked upon by our Republicans or Common wealths men (not without ſome contempt) as his Majeſties <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Creatures of the Prerogative,</hi> as they common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called them. And therefore, Fourthly, that the Marqueſſe of <hi>Hertford</hi> was not likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove me for calling my ſelfe <hi>his Majeſties crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the workmanſhip of his hands,</hi> in reference to my temporal fortunes, and the place I held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb facs="tcp:130574:175"/>
the King; that Noble perſon, acknowledging with a loyal gratitude that he received his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the Honourable Title of Lord Marqueſſe from the hands of his Majeſty; and that his <hi>being made</hi> Governour to the Princes Highneſſe was the Kings ſole <hi>workmanſhip.</hi> Finally, if all expreſſions of this nature muſt be laid aſide, and that we muſt be taught a new <hi>Court-Dialect,</hi> becauſe ſome Divines of the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> and other profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Monarchical Government do not like the old; we muſt diſcharge the Titles of <hi>moſt High and Might,</hi> of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and <hi>ſacred Majeſty,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe diſliked by <hi>Buchanan</hi> in his moſt ſeditious Book <hi>de Jure Regni.</hi> By whom ſuch adjuncts are reputed <hi>inter Barbariſmos &amp; Soleciſmos Aulicos,</hi> and amongſt the Barbariſmes and extravagancies of the Courts of Princes.</p>
            <p>But for the clearer ſatisfaction of all equal and unbyaſſed perſons, I ſhall lay down the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, as to that particular. In which the Reader is to know, that at his Majeſties firſt making choice of <hi>Oxon</hi> for his Winter Quarters, <hi>Anno</hi> 1642. The courſe of my attendance carried me to wait upon him there as a Chaplaine in ordinary. Where I had not been above a week, when I received his Majeſties command by the Clerk of the Cloſet for attending Mr. Secretary <hi>Nicholas</hi> on the morrow morning, and applying my ſelf from time to time to ſuch dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as I ſhould receive from him in order to his Majeſties ſervice. Which command was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards re-inforced upon me, when the time of my
<pb facs="tcp:130574:176"/>
ordinary attendance of the Court was at an end for that yeare (as can be proved by two ſeveral intimations of it under his owne moſt Royall hand) with this charge ſuper-added to it, that I was not to depart the Town without ſpeciall leave. I found by this that my attendance at the Court was like to laſt as long as the Warre, and therefore that it did concerne me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comodate my ſelfe with Lodging and ſuch other neceſſaries as might both encourage and enable me to performe thoſe ſervices which were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at my hands. A Chamber in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge being vacant within few moneths after by the abſence of one of the Fellows, and the death of the other, I gained the free conſent of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent party (Maſter <hi>Hobs</hi> by name, in whom the ſole right of it then remained) to make uſe of it for my ſelfe, and my little Company.</p>
            <p>Five moneths I quietly enjoyed it without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption. But coming from the Court on <hi>Alhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> I found ſome ſouldiers in the Roome, who told me that they came to take poſſeſſion of it for Maſter <hi>D.</hi> who had ſucceeded in the Rights of the man deceaſed, and that they meant to keep it for him untill further order. This<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried me back unto the Court, where I acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Maſter Secretary with the indignity and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front which was put upon me; deſiring him either to defend me from contempt and ſcorne, or that he would get me a diſcharge from that employment which had laine ſo long and heavy on me. By his advice a ſhort Petition was drawn
<pb facs="tcp:130574:176"/>
up to his ſacred Majeſty, briefly containing the particulars before laid downe, and humbly praying in the cloſe, that he would graciouſly be pleaſed to extend unto me ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his power and favour in the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, as might preſerve me in a fit capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to proceed in thoſe ſervices, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I could not be able to performe, as I had done formerly. His Majeſty thereupon gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the now Lord Biſhop of <hi>Lichfield</hi> being then Preſident of the Colledge, to ſee me re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled for the preſent; and to Sir <hi>Arthur Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who was then Governour of the Towne to take ſome ſtrict courſe with his Souldiers, for not giving me the like diſturbance for the time to come; which was the leaſt I could expect from his Majeſties goodneſſe.</p>
            <p>And here I thought my troubles had beene at an end. But ſo it happened that the Lord Marqueſſe of <hi>Hertford</hi> was at the ſame time choſen Chancellor of the Vniverſity; and ſome of his ſevants muſt be dealt with to eſpouſe the quarrell. By whoſe ſoliticaton, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to attend his Lordſhip whithin few dayes after, and I went accordingly. But when I came, and that his Lordſhip ſaw how farre his Majeſty had already apperaed in the buſineſſe, he could not but perceive withall how unfit it was for him to take any cognizance of that cauſe which by his Majeſty had beene heard and predetermined. He thereupon preſently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
<pb facs="tcp:130574:177"/>
the buſineſſe, ſeemed much offended at the trouble which was given me in it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſmiſt the reſt of the company, retained me with him for ſome time; held ſome diſcourſe with me about the quality and eſtate of the Kings affaires, and finally called for Ale and Wine for my entertainment. But notwithſtanding thoſe indignities which were put upon me on the one ſide, and thoſe many advantages which I had on the other, I carried my ſelfe fairly all along to my troubleſome Landlord, gave him a civil treatment in the <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Holidays, preſented him with no inconſiderable new-years gift, as the times then were; and promiſed him that as ſoone as otherwiſe I could provide my ſelfe of convenient Lodging, I would give him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment he ſo much deſired. Nor was it long before I did make good that promiſe. Since which time all fair offices and friendly corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencies have paſt between us, there being nothing (I thank God) which I can more eaſily forget then the ſenſe of Injuries.</p>

            <p>And thus good Reader thou haſt ſeene thoſe horrible prophanations, ſlanders and ingratitudes,
<pb facs="tcp:130574:177"/>
for which I ſtand arraigned in that ſcurrilous Libell, for by that name I ſhall take leave to call that Pamphlet, which for the Ribauldry thereof was ſtopt by the Vice-Chancellor at the Preſſe in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and being at laſt brought forth in the dark at <hi>London,</hi> is neither juſtified by the name of the Authour, nor otherwiſe offered unto ſale then by an underhand promoting of it amongſt thoſe of that Faction. But there is ſtill a race of men as anciently there was in Saint <hi>Hieroms</hi> time; <hi>qui aliorum vituperatione laudabile ſe vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri cupiunt,</hi> which hope to get themſelves a name by defaming others. And for my part I am content they ſhould enjoy the ignominy of that Peccant humour (which is ſo proper to the Text) without other cenſure then that which <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-Angel paſſed upon the Devil, when he contended with him for the body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of whom it is written by Saint <hi>Jude,</hi> that he durſt not bring a railing accuſation againſt that Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer <hi>of the brethren,</hi> but left him to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Almighty God, with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>the Lord rebuke thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have but one thing more to adde, and that relates to the Integrity of Doctor <hi>Barlow,</hi> who ſtands defamed by the Libeller and his <hi>alter i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem</hi> for uſing ſome unjuſt dealing towards Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi> Doctor <hi>Sparks, &amp;c.</hi> in his relation of the conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court. For proofe whereof one Maſter <hi>Sparks</hi> (affirmed to be a man of <hi>eminent learning</hi>) muſt be diſquieted at
<pb facs="tcp:130574:178"/>
his death, (if not rather raiſed up from the dead) to declare his knowledge; who ſignified by his friend <hi>I. M.</hi> what he once heard from <hi>H. G.</hi> an aged Miniſter concerning Doctor <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's</hi> ſorrow at his death-bed for the wrong he had done to Doctor <hi>Reynolds,</hi> and the reſt in relating that conference with <hi>H. I.</hi> is reported to have added further, that being at a Table with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Sparks</hi> the ſonne of Doctor <hi>Sparks,</hi> he found him very ſenſible of the abuſe (of which he could not ſpeak without great indignation) which had been put upon his Father and Doctor <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi> by the ſaid Relator. But firſt the man himſelf is dead, from whom we are to take our greateſt light in ſo dark a buſineſſe. And who can tell but that this whole narration may be one of thoſe pious fraudes deviſed by the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phleter, or his <hi>Alter Idem) nec enim nunc fallere primum, Incipit a nobis</hi>—for impoſing as well upon the dead as upon the living. Secondly, the principal witneſſe being dead, the credit of the ſigment reſteth on two common vouchers, that is to ſay <hi>I. M.</hi> and <hi>H. I.</hi> as eaſie to be found, and as honeſt folk as <hi>Nicholas Nemo,</hi> in <hi>Utopia,</hi> or Madam <hi>Charity</hi> of the <hi>Oudemeon</hi> ſtreet in <hi>Mantinea,</hi> or Doctor <hi>H. H.</hi> in the Margin of the Libel which is now before us. Thirdly, it muſt needs ſeeme exceeding ſtrange to a ſober Reader, that this great truth ſhould lie conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (like a ſpark raked up in aſhes) five and fifty years, and then blaze out upon a ſudden, when it was not thought of. And, Fourthly, I
<pb facs="tcp:130574:178"/>
had once the happineſs to be exeeeding well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Maſter <hi>Thomas Sparks</hi> of <hi>Cando<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I have now done with theſe polemical diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſhall not eaſily ingage in a new adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unleſſe invincible neceſſity, or ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable provocation ſhall inforce me to it. In which caſe only it is poſſible that I may be tempted to the reſuming of thoſe armes which otherwiſe I would willingly hang up in the Temple of <hi>Concord:</hi> that I may ſpend the whole remainder of my time in more peacefull ſtudies. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done my part in vindicating the Doctrine, Government, and formes of worſhip, eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And it is time to leave the <hi>Stage</hi> to more able <hi>Actors.</hi> To whom I recommend the care of that weighty buſineſſe, not doubting but that my endeavours in the
<pb facs="tcp:130574:179"/>
