            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But thoſe thinges, whyche (after the death of Marcus, by all ages.)

And thoſe thinges we ſee with our eyes, doo prouoke muche more compaſſion and pitie. Beſydes this my reaſon is commune with you: for in the recompence of the good wyll I haue heretofore borne you, I hope and as of duty loke for a mutuall beneuolence at your handes. And at this preſente it is ſo happened, that I muſt make profe, whether I haue in vayne ſo longe to fore exhybited honour vnto you, (hauing you alway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in eſtimacion) and employed all my diligent ſtudie towardes your welthe: And you in recompencing the

Be you therfore, (for me but one) many fathers vnto hym, in garnyſhing his maners, wyth prompting, and miny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring holſome preceptes vnto hym: for, neyther maye the aboundaunce of treaſour, ſatiſfie the ſenſual luſtes of tyranny, neyther can the Emperoure, be aſſured<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly defended by the bande of his garde, enuyroning hys perſon, except, he haue the good willes of thoſe whom he gouerneth. For euermore they raigne longe, and peaceably, by whom no feare through cruelti, but loue through gentlenes, is powred into the hartes of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tezyns: neyther they whome force conſtrayneth, but thoſe which of their free wylles obey, are eyther in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſuffering, exempt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all ſuſpicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of flatery.

But it is very harde for a man, which lyueth in mooſt inordinate licence, to gouerne him ſelf, and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle his affections. Wherfore, yf ye wilbe Authours of well lyuing vnto him, and oftentimes admonyſhe him of thoſe thinges he preſently heareth, ye ſhal with that one labour, bothe make hym a good prynce vnto your ſelfes, and all other, and alſo deſerue the participation of our memorye, whiche with this one poynt ye maye make immortall. Whyles themperour Marcus was ſpeaking thieſe wordes, his vitall ſpirite began ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinly to fayle, that furthwyth, he was enforced to ceaſe his talke, and ſlyde downe into his bed agayne. Then ſo greate compaſſion, perced the heartes of all that were preſent, that many of them, beyng through ſorowe almoſt berafte their ryght ſenſes, rayſed a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorouſe clamour.

that age, &amp; vnto their poſterite, a perpetuall renowne of vertue. When the fame of his death, was ſpreadde abroade, an incredible lamentacion was, aſwel amon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geſt the hole armye ſelfe, as the common people: So that no man within the Romaine dominion, receiued this meſſage, without abundaunt ſheading of teares. And bewayleng the loſſe of him, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> one accorde, ſome called hym a good father, other ſome a bening Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, Certayne a mooſt valyaunt Capitayne, and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny a ryghteous and moderate prynce: And truely, there was none of them deceyued.

For during my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lyfe, I neuer behaued my ſelfe as ſuperiour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, for that he loued vs all equally, and dyd more wyllingly call me companion, then Sonne: bicauſe he eſteamed the one, to be a name of nature, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he reckened to be the participacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vertue. And often times, he caried me in his armes, whiles I was an infante, delyuered me into your handes, and (as I might ſaye) gaue me wholy vnto your cuſtodie, and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delyte. Wherefore, I doubt not, but that ye wyll exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byte vnto me your fauour, for myne elders, oughte to repute me as their ſonne: and myne equalles in age, I

Nowe after hym, hath fortune, gyuen me for a prince vnto you: not a ſtraunger, (as ſome hath bene before me,) nor one whyche vaunteth hym ſelfe of a conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Empyre: but I was onelye borne vnto you, and brought vp in the verye Imperyall Palayce: And as ſoone as I was out of my moothers wombe, thympe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryall purple receyued me, in ſo muche that I was no ſooner a man, then a Prynce. Ponderynge therefore theſe thynges in your myndes, loue &amp; embrace your ryghtful Emperour, not gyuen, but borne vnto you. For my father is taken vp intoo the heauens, &amp; made companyon wyth the Goddes: And vntoo vs, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymente of the earthe, and gouernaunce of mortall cauſes doo appertayne.

When he had thus muche ſpoken, he dyſtrybuted amonges the Souldyours, a greate ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of money, (that he myghte thereby confyrme their heartes faythefull, and louynge towardes hym) and then retourned into hys Palayce.

Whiles he thieſe cauſes moued, (all the reſt, hauing their eyes caſte vpon the earth, with ſtyll and ſorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenaunce) Pompeianus, (who in age was the mooſt auncient, and had maried Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modus eldeſt ſyſter) aroſe vp and ſayed It is no meruayle, o Sonne and ſoueraigne,<note place="margin">The ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of pompeia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nus vnto Commo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dus.</note> that you are holden wyth deſyre of your countrey, for the very ſame deſyre of ſeyng oure houſholdes, dothe vrge and ſturre vs alſo. But we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe that affection, for that thaffaires we haue here in hande, requyre the fyrſte parte, and lyeth vs more vpon to diſpatche. As for the pleaſures of the Citye, you ſhall longer enioye hereafter: And Rome is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynually, where the Emperour ſoiourneth. Nowe to gyue ouer the warre lately begonne, beſydes that it is ſhamefull, it is alſo very peryllous: for thereby we miniſter occaſion of audacitee, vnto the Barbarouſe people: who wyll thinke, that we are not departed for cauſe of recreacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that we are fledde being daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with feare. And vnto your ſelfe, howe gloriouſe wyll it be, after ye haue vanquiſhed all your enemies, and enlarged the boundes of your Empyre vnto the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, to retourne to Rome wyth tryumphe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, to haue ledde bounde as captyues, the barbarouſe kynges and Lordes? for truly after this ſorte, in the former worldes, did the Romaynes, were noble and famouſe. There is no cauſe, why you ſhoulde feare that your affayres in the city, are in any haſarde. For euery principall ſenatour is here preſent wyth you, and the hole army, doth before your eyes defende your Empire: yea, and all your chiefeſt Treaſoure, is with vs alſo. The memorie beſides of your father, hath eſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blyſſhed a ſtedfaſt and perfecte beneuolence towardes you, with all eſtates. When Pompeianus perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hym to the better, had thus muche ſpoken, he did ſomewhat at that preſent, repreſſe the wyll and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the younge Emperour: who fearyng the olde mans ſayinges, hauing nothing wherwith he myght well replye, diſmyſſed the counſayle: promiſyng, that he would more diligently at leyſure, debate with hym ſelfe thoſe thinges. Yet afterwarde (hys ſeruauntes

and paraſites callynge more inſtantely vpon hym) he made no further relacion vnto hys Counſailours. But (hauyng ſent his letters vnto Rome, and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whom he thought meete, to defende the bankes of Hiſter, and reſtreigne the attemptes of the Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens) he cauſed furthwith his remouing to be proclay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Thei that were lefte behynde, diligently executed the offices appoynted them, and wythin a lytle ſpace, broughte many in ſubiection. And ſome they ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by great gyftes in frendeſhyp vnto them. The whiche was not verye harde to doo: For the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſe people beyng naturally gready of money, and deſpyſers of all daungers, do eyther gette their liuing wyth inuaſions, and pylleng of their neyghbours, or elles for an appoynted ſalarie, ſell their peace. The which thing Commodus perceyuyng, (that he might with money (wherof he had innumerable abundau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) purchaſe hym ſelfe ſecuritee and quiet) he denyed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnto the demaunders. Now aſſone as the fame of hys ſetting forwarde was ſpredde in the armye, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deynly a greate ſturre was amonges all the Souldy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, euery man deſyring to returne vnto Rome, and affecting the pleaſures of the citye, to leue theyr ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes countrey. And when it was blowen abroade, by reporte of purſeuauntes and poſtes, that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was retourning to the Citye, an incredible ioye wandered amonges the common people, euery man conceuing in hym ſelfe, a ſinguler hope of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perours preſence, and truſting aſſuredly that he would folowe his fathers ſteppes.

But aſſoone as he approched the borders of Italie, he was ſlayne by them vnto whome the charge of thexe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutyon was commytted. Thys ende had the father &amp; the Sonne: After whom Commodus appointed .ij. go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uernors, thynkyng it to be more ſure, not to commyt ſo great an aucthoritye vnto one man alone: but deui<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame in .ij. partes, make it by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mean, the more weake to rebell againſt the prince.<note place="margin">A newe conſpira<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cye.</note> But no long time after, there were other Treaſons conſpyred agaynſt hym in this maner.

The ſame ſodeinly forſaking y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Campe and adioynyng into hys felowſhyp certaine of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>panyons, gathered in a ſhorte ſpace an huge multy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of deſperate ruffynes. Fyrſt he deſtroyed vylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and cornefeldes, and than hauyng gotten a great Summe of money, he ioyned dayly more vacabondes vnto hym, and by promyſyng them greate rewardes, &amp; callyng them to the deuiſion of the pray, he brought the matter vnto ſuche poynt, that they ſemed to haue the aucthorytye, not of theues, but of iuſte enemyes. For they occupyed great Cityes, and therein brake y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common gaoles, and toke out of pryſon wythoute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte all offenders, whome through that releaſe and benefyte, they annexed vnto them. Then they ſpoyled wyth inuaſyons all Fraunce and Spayne, and wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had taken any great Citie, they would ranſake burne and vtterly deface the ſame and than departe. Whereof when Commodus had knowledge, he ſente letters not wantyng angry checkes, vnto the lieuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauntes of the Countryes there aboutes, reprouyng theyr cowardyſe, and therwyth commaundyng them to leuie an armye, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſubduyng of thoſe rebellious vacabondes. Which thing when the Ruffines knew, they thought it beſt to depart from thoſe Countries. Wherefore pryuely by ſecrete bypathes and vnkno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen wayes, they came into Italie, where Maternus conſulted wyth his complices, of thinuaſion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre, and other weyghty affayres. For ſeyng all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

hytherunto had proſpered wyth hym beyond his expectacyon, he determyned to attempt ſome notable enterpryſe, or at the leaſt wyſe, yf it chaunced amiſſe, too dye not obſcurelye or like a coward. But yet per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceyuyng hym ſelfe, not to haue ſo greate a power, as ſhould ſuffyſe to reſyſt Commodus, wyth an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and choſen armye, (for he knew that Commodus was well beloued of the Romayne people and men of armes) he concluded to worke his feate by crafty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyaunce. And therefore Inuented thys wyle. In the begynnyng of the ſprynge tyme, vpon an appoynted holy day, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Romaynes vſed to celebrate a pompe vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Godes.

And euerye where a lycence too playe, is graunted all men, and too take vpon them the perſones of whom it liketh eche man beſte. There is no magyſtrate or offycer, but he is there repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the counterfaytynge of theyr perſones by ſuche as lyketh ſo to doo: ſo that a man can not raſſhely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the true parſon from the dyſguyſed. Thys dyd Maternus recken to be a conuenyente tyme for the cloſe atcheuyng of hys trayterous enterpryſe.

thanſkeſgeuing paſſe furthe the feaſt of the Goddeſſe: yea and the people beyng Ioyfull for the preſeruacyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theyr Emperour, celebrated meryly that daye. But what the reaſon is, wherefore the Romaynes do ſo muche honoure this Goddeſſe, it ſemeth not amyſſe for me to make mencion of it, as I haue learnid out of Hiſtories, eſpecially becauſe that matter is vnknowen vnto mooſt of the Greekes. The ſame Image there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as they ſaye) came downe from heauen, no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayntie remayning of what metall, or by what artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer it was wrought: yea they conſtantely beleaue, it was neuer made with manes handes.

When Pertinax had ſpoken thieſe thinges (hauyng added vnto the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate a good courage) he was receaued wyth ioyfull ſhoutes and verye honorabely entertayned.

they proclaymed the Empyre to be ſolde, ſayinge they woulde delyuer it vnto hym that woulde gyue moſte money for it, and woulde brynge hym ſafelye into the Emperyall Palayce.

Neyther durſte anye of them approche vnto the wall to purchaſe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> money ſo deteſtable a domynyon.

then they eyther durſte deſyre or hoped to receyue, neyther ſhoulde there be anye delaye in the payment: For (ꝙ he) it is ſafely kepte in my houſe.

For theſe cauſes the men of armes on the one part deteſted him. On the other ſide the people not ignoraunt thereof deſpyſed hym.

For the inhabitauntes of Italye beynge of a longe ſpace voyde from warre, dyd nowe tyll theyr lande and lyued in peace. For as longe as the Cytie was free, and that the Capitaynes for the warres were elected by the Senate, the Italyen naci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were euer in harneſſe.

But nowe I am here preſente, to bewraye the matter vnto you, leaſte hys preſumptuouſe Trecherye, ſhoulde oppreſſe you vnwares.</p>
            <p>Notwythſtandynge, that the Trybune ſpake theſe wordes wyth aboundaunce of teares, yet dyd not Seuerus at the fyrſte credyte it, ſo muche was the memorye of Plautyanus loue towardes hym, fyxed, as yet in hys breſte: yea, he ſuſpected all the matter too be contryued of a purpoſe, thynkynge that hys Sonne, who abhorred Plautyanus, and deteſted hys doughter, had Imagyned thys craftye Couyne, and mortall ſlaunder agaynſt hym. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hauynge called hys Sonne vnto hym, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to rebuke hym, for that he hadde deuyſed ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che myſchyefe agaynſte hys frende, and well wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. But Antonyne at the fyrſte, ſware, and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, that he was ygnoraunte of all thys buſyneſſe, and afterwardes encouraged the Trybune (whoo perſyſted in hys tale, and ſhewed furthe the booke) to declare the hole Treaſon. Than the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune (perceyuynge intoo howe greate daungere he was entered, not ygnoraunte howe muche in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure Plautyanus was wyth Seuerus, and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynge precyſelye, that yf the Treaſon laye hydden, and the matter not throughly proued, him ſelfe ſhould receyue extreame and cruell deathe,) ſpake thus vnto them. My Soueraigne Lordes (ꝙ he) what more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple argumente or perfecte proofe do you ſeke hereof? permytte that I maye go furthe of the Courte,
<pb facs="tcp:4191:48"/>
and by ſome ſecrete and truſty perſon certifye Plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus, that all his commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement is fulfilled. He be leuyng it, wilbe here out of hande, to occupie the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice as voide. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal it be your partes, to examine, and trye oute the truth. And after he had thus muche ſpoken, he choſe a faythfull, and truſtye perſone vnto hym, whych ſhould in his name exhorte Plautianus, to make haſte and come furthwith to the Coorte, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge bothe the Princes were ſlayne: for it behoued hym, before the deade were publyſhed amonges the people, to be within the Palaice: that therby, occupy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enge the Principall Tower, and eſtablyſhenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre vnto hym ſelfe, all men ſhould maugre their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes obey hym as one not entringe into thempyre, but as already poſſeſſed therof. Plautianus crediting this matter, was puffed with a meruailouſe preſumption and hope. And putting on hym a ſhyrte of mayle for the ſure defence of hys bodye, aboute the euenynge of the ſame daye aſcended into hys Chariotte, and made haſte towardes the Coorte with a fewe whyche were preſent attending vpon hym, who thoughte he hadde bene ſente for by the Emperours, about ſome earneſt and weighty buſyneſſe. And when he was wythoute let of any manne, entered into the Palayce, the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters beynge ignoraunte, what the matter mente) the Trybune mette hym, ſaluted hym as Emperoure by colluſyon of purpoſe imagined, toke hym by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and ledde hym into the Chamber, where he feygned that bothe the dead Emperours Corpſes laye. Nowe hadde Seuerus appoynted certayne of hys Garde to laye handes vpon hym, as ſoone as he were commen in. But when Plautianus, hauinge at that inſtaunte other fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſyes in his heade, was entred into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſawe the two Emperours there ſtandynge, and perceyued hym ſelfe apprehended, beyng wyth that ſo greate a matter, very ſore agaſte, he began humbly to entreate, and deſyre pardon, affyrminge that all thys dryfte was forged vniuſtely, of malice againſt him. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Seuerus reproued hym, reherſynge the manye tolde benefites, and honors, he had beſtowed on hym.
<pb n="xliii" facs="tcp:4191:48"/>
And Plautianus replyed agayne, repetynge the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of hys accuſtomed truthe, and good wyll to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes themperour: wherwith Seuerus began ſome what to relente, and credite the wordes of Plautianꝰ: vntyll that the ſhyrte of mayle appeared throughe a ſlyt of his vpper garment. Whiche Antonyne percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing being a ſterne, and fierſe yonge man, and therto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore deteſting Plautianꝰ, ſaied. I wold gladli wete (ꝙ he) what anſwere thou wylte make vnto thieſe two pointes. Why cameſt thou in the euening, vnto them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>perours vnſent for? And what meaneth this ſherte of mayle thou weareſt? for who commeth in armure to a Supper or banquette? And hauinge ſo ſayde,<note place="margin">The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Plauti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>anus.</note> he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Tribune, and thoſe that were preſent to ſtabbe hym in with their ſwordes, and daggers, as a manyfeſt Traitour, and open enemye. And thei ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge no delaye in the mater, executed Themperours commaundement, ſlewe the man, and threwe hys bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into the highe waye, to be ſpurned at, &amp; ſkorned of the people. This iuſte ende of lyfe had Plautianus, a man of inſatiable auarice. After this done, Seuerus conſtituted two Capitaynes ouer the men of armes, and hym ſelfe moſte commenly ſoiourned in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbes, or elles nyghe the Sea coſtes of Campania, ſitting in iudgement, vpon maters of controuerſy in the lawe. And beyng very diligent in Ciuile affayres, chiefly coueyted to haue his childerne traded at Rome with decente, &amp; honeſt maners. For he perceiued that theyr myndes were bente vnto playes, and ſhewes, more vehementlye, then became theſtate of Princes. Wherby it wold come to paſſe, that the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tencions, tending to diuerſe purpoſes, their willes alſo, and appetites woulde become dyſagrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as it were) certaine brondes of debate, ſhold be kindled betwene them. But eſpecially Antonyne, after the death of Plautianus, wexed terrible vnto al men. Beſides that, he compaſſed wyth all the crafte, &amp; ymaginacions, he could deuiſe, how he might deſtroy the doughter of Plautyanus, hys owne wyfe. But Seuerus ſent her with her lytle Sonne, whyche ſhe
<pb facs="tcp:4191:49"/>
had by Antonine, into Sicilia, with as much richeſſe, as abundantely ſuffyced, for her meate, and drincke, &amp; other neceſſaries: Enſuyng in that point, Auguſtꝰ, who entreated after the ſame ſort, the Sonnes of An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tonius, after he was adiudged a Traitour. Seuerus endeuoured in all that he coulde, to reduce hys Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to loue, and concorde, and to reconcyle eyther to other, admonyſhing them, with auncient Hiſtories, and examples, wherin many calamytes, riſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thrughe diſcorde of Bretherne, wer reherſed. He added therun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to the Treaſure him ſelfe hadde gathered togither, all the Temples filled with money, and the richeſſe, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che encreaſed daylye of foreyne Tributes, howe the Souldiours, might through that abundaunce, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned with ample, and riche gyftes, and how the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of armes in the Citye, were augmented foure times, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thei were before, and ſo greate an armye, ſoiorned nyghe the Citye, that no forreyn power (yf a man conſidered the ſelfe multitude, or the greatnes of their bodies, or elles the abundaunce of money) could be founde comparable vnto them. But all thieſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he ſayed, wolde be of none effecte, whiles the two brethren dyſagreed &amp; kepte ciuell warre within them ſelues. With reherſall hereof, and entermedlyng cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections with praier, he laboured, to repreſſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent courages, and to bringe them to an atonement, and concorde. But all was in vaine, for thei had thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen the brydelles out of theyr mouthes, beyng conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually enclyned to the worſte. And although the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge men, through the feruencie of their youth, and immo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derate lycence, were ſturred too much alreadye, vnto delytes of ſundrye voluptuouſe luſtes, yet were there euer redi at their elbowes, flockes of paraſites, which allured them vnto diuerſe, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary diſpoſicions: not only extolling their diſſolute vices, but alſo inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting newe pleaſures, wherwith the one myght be pleaſed, and the other offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. Of the which paraſites, Seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus hym ſelfe, apprehended many, in the verye miny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of theyr flatterye, and therefore dyd put theim to death. As the olde man was thus in mynde moleſted,
<pb n="xliiii" facs="tcp:4191:49"/>
wyth the ſenſuall, and vnhoneſte lyfe, and delytes of hys Sonnes, he receyued letters from hys lyuete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunte of Englande, wherby he was enformed, how the barbarouſe people rebelled, and waſted thole Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with inuaſions, and Commocions.<note place="margin">Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and mutine in England</note> Wherefore, he neaded a greater puyſſaunce of men, to reſiſte, and ſuppreſſe them: there wanted the Emperours preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce alſo. Glad was Seuerus hereof: for beynge a man of his owne nature, greadie of renowne, after his vyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, in thoriente, and Septententrion, and his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame obtained, he coueyted to make ſome Conqueſt, ouer the Englyſhemen. And to lede hys Sones, fourthe of the Citie, that being farre from the pleaſures therof, thei might accuſtome them ſelfes, to warlike, and ſober dyet. Wherfore, he proclaimed his expedicion into Britayne, beynge very olde, and ſore troubled with the goute, but yet of ſo valiaunte a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make, as neuer was any yonge man. In hys iorney, he roade mooſt communely in a horſe litter, neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting longe in any place. When he had ended his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and paſſed the Ocean Sea, with as muche celeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee as can be thoughte, he entred into Brytaine, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered his Souldiours, hauing gathered a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derfull power togithers, and prepared hym ſelfe to batayle. The Britons, beynge aſtonied, and agaſte wyth thys ſo ſodeine arriuall, of themperour, And hearinge that ſo huge, an hoſt was aſſembled againſt them, ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Am<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>baſſadors vnto him, to purge their miſdemeanours, &amp; entreate for peace. But Seuerus, makinge delaies of purpoſe, leſt he ſhuld retorne to Rome, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out ani thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g done, &amp; being very deſyrous of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſt, &amp; Surname of Britaine, diſmiſſed the Ambaſſadors home againe, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any reſolute anſwere, geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their ſuite.

Then Antonine, went about eche companye, vewing them, and praiſinge this and that, in euerye one as he liked, vntil his whole hoſt had compaſſed them vnwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and loking for no ſuch thinge.

Wherefore, theſe thynges ioyned togethers, and agreinge in one, they ſhoulde (he ſayde) eaſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, vnder one Scepter, and Diademe, the Empire of the whole worlde.

After the Parthian kinge, had receaued theſe letters, he fyrſt denied the requeſt, ſaying, that a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous matrimony became not a Romain. For what co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cord (quod he) woulde be betwene them, which vſed not one language, nor one kind of liuing, &amp; appayrel? There were (he ſayde) at Rome manye Senatours doughters, amonges whome the Emperoure might choſe hym a wyfe: as there were in hys domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, certayne called Arſacide.<note place="margin">Arſacide.</note> Neyther was there anye cauſe, he thoughte, why anye of them, ſhoulde be alyenated from theyr natiue countrey.

And the other, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way exercyſed, in matters of the lawe, and therin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly learned. This man, the Prince vſed to taunte, &amp; checke openly, as a man nothyng valiaunte, or apt to warre. For hearing that he fedde very delycately, and reiected thoſe ſymple, and warlycke meates, whyche Antonyne vſed, and that he ware a gowne, and other decente apparayle, lyke vnto a Cytizen, he reproued hym, as a womanly perſon, threatnynge oftentymes to kyll hym. Macrynus beyng therof impacient, was ſturred with meruaylouſe anger. Thereunto happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this chaunce: it was perdie expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, ſhould ones fynyſhe hys lyfe. For beynge of hys owne nature, ouer curiouſe, he ſtudyed, not onely, to knowe the priuey affayres of men, but alſo, to ſerche oute, the ſecretes, of the Goddes, and Dyuels. And throughe continual feare of Treaſon, conſulted with many oracles, and retayned aboute him, diuerſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giciens, Aſtrologiens, and Sothſayers, omytting no creature, whiche profeſſed thoſe fantaſies, and ylluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

when the reſidue of the hoſte heard therof, thei ranne togethers furthwyth to the Emperours dead corps: vpon the whiche Macrinus fyrſte of all fell, and fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to lament it exceadynglye.

When he had thys muche ſpoken, the Souldiours perceauynge the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitye preſente, fell vnto armes, and ſet them ſelues in order of battayle. At the ryſyng of the Sonne, they ſawe Artabanus, marchynge forwarde with an huge armye.

But the Romaynes (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng ſtrongely planted theyr fronte, diſtributed the Maurytanian horſemen, on eyther ſyde, and receaued into the mids of theyr battaile, the Dimilaunces, and lyght horſemen) reſiſted valiauntlye the Barbarous people at the fyrſte, the which vexed them greuouſly, with the multitude of arrowes, &amp; longe ſpeares, wher with the men at armes that rode on Camelles, &amp; hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, foughte and ſkirmiſhed.

But when they wer oppreſſed with the Barbarous horſmen, &amp; Camelles, faining to flea, they planted Caltrops, &amp; other engins of yron, ſharpe at thone eand in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de.

But the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, ſeynge the ſame, ioyned not together, in a rounde compaſſe, but ſet them ſelues in a longe front, that they myghte thereby, prohibyte the compaſſynge of theyr enemies.

<pb facs="tcp:4191:66"/>
Wherefore, in beholding thieſe thinges, thei greatly reproued it, and deſpyſed the trade of hys lyfe, as a thing more wanton, then became a warlyke perſon. And they compared the wanton ſenſualitie of Macri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, and the wyttie, and warlyke maners of Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne. Further, they greatlye grudged, that they laye ſtyll in the Campe, farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their natiue Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, oftentymes wanting their neceſſary foode, and were not diſcharged home, after peace made, &amp; truce taken, whiles he, led hys lyfe in wanton pleaſures. Wherefore, hauynge throwen, as it were, the brydle out of their mouthes, thei ſpake euery daye agaynſte him, ſeeking ſome occaſion, were it euer ſo ſmall, to flea hym. And ſo it was by deſtenye appoynted, that Macrinus, after he had one onely yeare voluptuouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Raigned, ſhould loſe, both hys Empyre &amp; his lyfe: fortune hauing miniſtred, lyght, and ſymple occaſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Souldiors, to commytte, that thei had deſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.<note place="margin">Phenicia Moeſa Emeſa.</note> There was a certen Phenycien woman, named Moeſa, borne in a Citye of Phenicia called Emeſa, Suſter vnto Iulia the wyfe of Seuerus, &amp; Moother of Anthonine.

The ſame Moeſa, after the death of her Suſter, and murdre of Anthonyne, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crinus had commaunded, to retourne into her owne Countrey, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all her ſubſtance. And in ſothe, ſhe was wonderfull ryche of money, as one whyche of verye longe tyme, had bene brought vp within thimperiall Treaſourie. And being retorned home, ſhe there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually remayned, hauynge two daughters: of the whiche the eldeſt hyght Soemis, and the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger was named Mammea.<note place="margin">Soemis Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mea.

And not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thenhabytantes them ſelues, do worſhyppe it, but all the noble menne alſo of the nexte nacions, and the Barbarouſe Kynges, doo euerye yeare offer vnto it, ſumptuouſe, and precyouſe gyftes. There is no ymage made after the Romayne, and Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cien facion, lyke vnto thys God. For it is a myghtye ſtone from the botom ſharpened, more, and more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the toppe, much lyke a Pynaple.

In the ſame ſtone, are ſene very many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and colours, which they affirme, to be the ſhape of the Sonne, made by no mans hande. Vnto this ymage was Baſſianus ſacred prieſt. And becauſe he was thelder, hym ſelfe moſte commonlye executed the office, apparelled gorgeouſlye after the Barbarous maner.

And becauſe hys beautye, wyth the proportion of his bodye, the floure of hys age, and his gorgious decked apparel, wer ſo agreable togethers, men compared him, vnto the goodly Images of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſe. Nowe whyles thys Baſſianus was celebrating the ſacrifice, and daunſyng after the Barbarous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, men dyd attentiuely loke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: but chiefly the Romayne Souldiours (either for that they knew him to be of the Imperiall bloude, or elles, becauſe hys flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryſhynge beautye, allured euerye man, to caſte hys eyes towardes hym) for the Romayne hoſte laye then nyghe that Cytye: beyng ſente thither, for the defence of Phenicia, and ſhortly after departed from thence, as we ſhall hereafter declare.

Whome ſhe perceyuynge, to wonder at the beautie of thys Striplinge, reported vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he was the Sonne of Antonine, although he were ſuppoſed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: doubtfull it is, whether ſhe ſpake the truth, or not. For ſhe ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiles ſhe abode in thimperial pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laice, with her ſuſter, Antonine had to do with her .ii. doughters, being then yong &amp; faire. This being once told vnto them, &amp; by them told againe vnto the reſidue of their felowes, was furthwith publiſhed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thole Campe. It was beſides reported, that Meſa had whole heapes of money, which ſhe would gladlye diſtribute amonges the ſouldiors, if thei wold reſtore thempire, vnto her iſſue. They promiſed her therfore, (yf ſhe would come priuely by night into the Campe) to ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the gate, &amp; receaue her w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> her folkes in. For the which promiſe, the olde woman denied them nothyng that they dyd demaunde: being contente, rather to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, or take in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d any dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to lede a priuat, &amp; abiect life.

And ſo fortified them ſelues within the ſame, that yf nede required, they myght abyde the ſiege. When theſe thinges were reported vnto Macrinus, then ſoiornyng at Antioche, and a rumour was ſpred throughout the hoſt, that Antonynes ſon was fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, &amp; that the ſuſter of Iulia, gaue money vnto the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diors, when all that was ſpoken of, or thoughte to be poſſible, was holden for trew, euery man beganne to doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reuolt from Macrinus: ſtyrred partly ther vnto, through the hate thei bare vnto him, &amp; partelye through the pitie, whiche they had of the memorye of

But Macrinus, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pninge thole matter as childiſh, &amp; vſing his accuſtomed alacritie of minde, abode him ſelf at home, &amp; ſent one of his capytains furth, with as great a power, as ſeamed ſufficient, for the ſubduing of the rebelles.<note place="margin">Iulia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> But when Iulianus (for that was the Capitains name) came thither, &amp; began to lay ſiege to the walles, the Souldiours y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were within, ſhewed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Towers, &amp; other high places, the yong man: cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng with loude voices, that he was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Son of Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, &amp; lifting vp great bagges of money, which are the only baite of treaſon.

That eanded, the gates of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe were opened, and them ſelfes receiued in. Thus was theyr power augmented, able, not onely to abide a ſiege, and repulſe an aſſaulte, but alſo, to pytche a fielde, a great number of fugitiues, dayly reſortynge vnto them.

But ſoone after, he altered that mynde, ſayenge, that it was vnpleaſaunt for his God, to haue a warlyke, &amp; armed wyfe.

When he had brought theſe thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges into the Temple, layed the ſame there, and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed hys ſacrifice, he went vp into the hyghe towers, whych wer of purpoſe there erected, &amp; out of them, he threwe manye thynges amonges the people. That is to weete, cuppes of Syluer and Golde, garmentes of ryche worke, and all ſortes of lynnen clothe. He diſtri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>buted amonges them alſo, all kynde of tame beaſtes, except Swyne, from the whyche (accordynge to the Phenicien vſage) him ſelfe abſtained. In the catching wherof, many periſhed: ſome beynge thruſt to deathe in the preſſe, other ſome ſlayne wyth the Souldyours weapons. So that the ſame feſtiuall Pompe, was turned into a dolorous calamitie of manye men. Hym ſelfe beſydes, was manye tymes ſene cartynge, and leapynge. For he woulde not permitte hys owne flagitious exerciſes to be hydden: goynge often tymes abrode, wyth hys eyes painted, his browes made red, and hys face (beynge naturallye beautyful) deformed, with vndecent colours. The whiche when Meſa per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued, ſuſpectynge the indignation of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and fearynge, that yf oughte but good came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hym, her ſelfe ſhoulde be conſtrayned, to retourne to her priuate lyfe, ſhe perſuaded the fooliſh, and raſhe yonge man, to adopte into the Empire with him hys kynſman, and her neuewe, beynge borne of her dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter Mammea. And that ſhe myght the better pleaſe hym, ſhe ſayde, that he, whiche executed only the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of a Prieſt, &amp; celebrated the ſacrifices of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, ought to haue ſome Subſtitute, which ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerne the Empire, out of care, and trouble. Nowe was ther no ſtraunger, nor forreyne perſon, ſo meete to be elected thereunto, as hys owne kynſman. The ſame was Alerianus, whiche then was called Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, by hys fathers name, chaunged into the name of the Macedonien kynge. For the ſame kynge, being of great renowne, dyd Anthonine the Sonne of Seue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rus, chiefelye eruerence. Whyche Anthonine, theyr
<pb facs="tcp:4191:71"/>
Graundemother perſuaded the Souldyours, to be the Father of them both: blaſyng therby, the Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her doughters, that ſhe might therby cauſe the Souldyours the better to loue them. Wherfore A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander was declared Emperoure, and created Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſull wyth Antonyne:<note place="margin">Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der made Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roure.</note> the Senate determinyng wyth ſkorne, and laughter, that whyche Antonyne requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. That is to ſaye, hym ſelfe, beynge but fourtene yeares olde, to be the Father, and Alexander, whyche was vneth entred the twelueth yere of hys age, to be the Sonne. After Alexander was pronounced Emperoure, Antonyne endeuoured to corrupte him, wyth hys ſenſuall maners, that in ſyngynge, and daunſynge, beynge partaker of hys Prieſthode, he ſhoulde weare the ſame apparell, and vſe the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions with hym.

Wherat Antonine greatly grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, repentinge him of his adoption, and participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Empyre. And therfore, he expelled out of his Palaice, all thoſe Inſtructours, of whome ſome the excellenteſt, he put to death, and thother he afflicted with exile, allegyng agaynſt them, fooliſhe, and vaine cauſes, that they corrup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed hys Sonne, not ſuffering hym to vſe lybertye, and daunſynge, but inſtructinge hym, in modeſt, and comelye exerciſes. And he fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuche extreme folye, that he diſtributed the chiefeſt dignityes, in the common wealthe, amonges players of Commodies, and Enterludes.

Vnto Carters, Ruffyans, and diſordered Brotheis, he commytted the chiefe charge of the Empyre. And vnto hys Bonde men
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:4191:71"/>
and Lybertynes, as euerye of them exceaded another in abhomination, he delyuered the rule of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uynces. Thereby, all thynges, whyche before were honeſt, were tourned into vyle beaſtlyneſſe: whyche cauſed that all men, and chiefely the Romayne Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyours, deteſted hym, as one whych faſhyoned hys countenaunce, more wantonlye, then became anye honeſte woman. For he was decked wyth chaynes, and ouches of golde, and apparelled wyth laſciuious clothynge, vncomlye for a man, and daunſed daylye in the ſyght of them all. Wherfore they bare more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuolent myndes vnto Alexander, and had better con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in that Child, for that he was modeſtly brought vp. And they all ſaued hym, from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> treaſon, and myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe of Antonyne. Neyther woulde hys Moother Mammea, ſuffer hym to touche any meate, or drynke, that was ſent from the other. The chylde alſo vſed not any of the Imperiall, or common Cookes, and Paſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, but ſuche as hys Moother had choſen for hym, whyche were both truſty and honeſt. She gaue hym money alſo to diſtribute priuelye amonges the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyours, whyche chiefelye couete the ſame, that he myghte by it, as by a ſure lynked Chayne, drawe them vnto hym.</p>
            <p>When Antonyne perceaued that, he inuented all the miſchiefe he coulde agaynſte Alexander, and hys Moother. Neuertheleſſe, theyr common Graundmoo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther Moeſa avoyded all ſuche crueltye. For ſhe was a woman of a ſtoute corage, and had alſo of longe tyme ſoiourned in the Imperiall Palayce, wyth her Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Seuerus wyfe, whereby ſhe was throughlye ſkylfull of that whiche Antonyne entended: who was naturallye full of talke, and wythoute diſcretion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to blaſe abrode, what ſoeuer he mynded, or woulde haue done. And then ſeynge hys enterpriſe not to proceade, as he wyſhed, he determined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue the Chylde all of Imperyal honours. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, commaunded that he ſhoulde be no longer ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as Emperoure, neyther woulde he ſuffer hym to go abrode amonges the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4191:72"/>But the Souldiours deſyred hym wonderfullye, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynyng that the Empire ſhould be taken from him. Then Anthonine cauſed a rumoure to be blowen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, that Alexander was deade, to the entente he myght thereby perceaue, after what ſorte, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyours woulde take the ſame. But they ſeynge the chylde not appeare abrode, and hauynge theyr hartes perſed wyth thoſe ſorowefull tidynges, waxed won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull wrothe, withelde from Antonine hys accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed garde, and hauynge ſhutte the gates of theyr Campe, ſayde, they woulde perforce ſee Alexander, within theyr Temple. Antonyne beyng thereby ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten wyth feare, rode vnto the Campe in the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Chariot, beynge adorned wyth precious ſtones, wherin alſo ſate Alexander.

Him ſelfe prouyded wyth muche dilygence, weapons and harneſſe for the ſame.</p>
            <p>It ſemed then good vnto hym, to proue by another Ambaſſade, whether the Perſian Kynge, woulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcende vnto peace, and vnitie. For beynge hym ſelfe preſente, he lytle doubted, eyther to perſuade Artax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erxes, as he woulde, or at leaſt wyſe put hym in feare, wyth menaces. But the barbarous kynge, diſmiſſed the Romayne Oratours home agayne, wythout any thynge concluded.

The effect of theyr Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade was this.</p>
            <p>The great Kyng Artaxerxes, commaunded the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr Emperour, to depart out of Syria, &amp; al that part of Aſia, which is ſituate ouer againſt Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:<note place="margin">Ionia.

            <p>When thieſe thynges were thus ended, and whiles Alexander was buſyed in preparacion of Bridges to paſſe ouer the Ryuers, and to leade the Romayne Armye into the confynes of the Barbariens, there reuolted, and fledde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hym, many Egiptian Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, and in Siria alſo, dyuerſe Commocions, beganne to kyndle agaynſte hys gouernemente.

<pb n="lxxi" facs="tcp:4191:77"/>
the Barborouſe horſemen, throughe the ſtepenes, of the ſharpe rockye Mountaynes, hadde a more vneaſy trauayle, and laboriouſe iorneye. There, was it declared, vnto the Perſian Kynge, that an other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye of the Romayns, was entred, into ſuche borders of the Parthians, as extended towardes the orient.

            <p>The Romayne Armye, marched forwarde ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye ſlowelye, for that no manne reſyſted theim. Thynkynge, that Alexander wyth the thyrde parte of theim, (wherein were the chyefeſt menne of warre) was alreadye entred, into the myddes of the Barbaryens.

            <p>For, in deade, ſhe blemyſſhed, and blunted, all hys noble, and valyaunte courage, in perſwadynge hym, rather to ſende other furth to the warres, then ſtande hym ſelfe in battayle.

But when thei had for a lytle ſpace, encloſed theim ſelues wyth theyr Targettes, and were aſſaulted lyke vnto a walled Citye,<note place="margin">The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes vanquiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</note> and ſlayne on euery parte, hauynge vnto the ende valyauntly reſyſted, they were murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red downe ryghte.</p>
            <p>This was a meruelous calamitie, vnto the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayns, the lyke whereof, can be in no age remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, for thei had nowe loſte a greate armye, worthy, eyther for Loyalte, or ſtrengthe, to be compared, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to anye auncient Hoſte, before paſſed. But the wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſucceſſe of thieſe affayres, enhaunſed the mynde of the Perſyan Kynge, wyth hope of greater enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryſes.</p>
            <p>Whereof when Alexander heard (beynge at that tyme, verye ſore ſycke, eyther throughe peſyuenes of mynde,<note place="margin">The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wroth wyth A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</note> or els thintemperatnes of the ayre) he toke it verye greuouſlye, and thole armye, waxed wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full wrothe, agaynſte Themperoure.

<pb n="lxxii" facs="tcp:4191:78"/>
The handes, whiche were attendaunt vpon hys per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonne, hym ſelfe ledde backe vnto Antioche, hauynge loſte manye of them alſo. Wherfore, thys matter broughte muche ſorowe vnto the armye, and greate diſhonour vnto Alexander, Fortune hauynge decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hym in all places, and tourned hys entent to none effecte. For a meruaylous numbre of thoſe .iii. armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es (ſo perdye, had he deuided them) were deſtroyed by diuers calamities, as ſyckenes, battayle, and colde. When Alexander was come vnto Antioche, he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered health, refreſhed wyth the temperat ayre there, and aboundaunce of water, after the burnynge heate of Meſopotamia, refreſhed alſo hys Souldyours, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>But then was it declared vnto hym, that the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyan Kynge, hadde dyſmyſſed all hys Souldy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours home to theyr habytacions. For althoughe the Barbaryens, ſeamed to be the Superyours in Battayle, yet throughe often, and ſundrye Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayles, foughte in Media, and Parthia, a great parte of them were ſlayne, the reſt whyche remayned, were eyther empayred wyth dyſeaſes, or elles in Skyrmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes ſore wounded. Neyther were the Romaynes flowlye ouercome, but them ſelues were many times noyſome vnto theyr enemyes: beynge by none other meane vanquiſhed, then for that they were, fewer in numbre, entrapped.</p>
            <p>For when almoſte lyke numbre, was on bothe ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des ſlayne, the reſt of the Barbariens, not in ſtrength and proweſſe, but onelye in multitude, ſeamed to be the better, whereof, this is ſufficient profe, that the Barbariens, in .iii. or .iiii. yeres after, fell not againe vnto armes. The whyche when Alexander vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtode, he made hys abode ſtyll at Antioche. And being

Wherfore, they greatly grudged againſt Alexander, as yf by hys cowardyſe, theyr former affayres, had bene betrayed in Thori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and that now he protracted his remoue, when as the Northerne cauſes, earneſtly called for hym. Now ſtode Alexander, and hys frendes, in greate doubte of Italie: the affayres of the Perſians and the Germai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, beyng of vnlyke daunger.

And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge wyth ſpede eanded his iourneye, he pitched his Campe, vpon the banckes of the Rheine, &amp; there made prouiſion, for al neceſſaryes, belongyng to the warre.</p>
            <p>Fyrſt, he made a Bridge of Shippes and Galleyes, ouer the Rheyne, and Danowe, that the Romaynes myghte paſſe to the other ſyde, by the ſame.

Bycauſe the Mauritanians do ſhoote theyr arrowes from farre, are quycke, nymble, and ſwifte to ſkyppe, to and fro.

But the Romayne Souldyours grudged greatlye, that they waſted theyr tyme in vayne, wythoute occaſion of atchieuyng any thynge, whereby they myghte ſhewe theyr valyaunte corage, whyles Alexander, gaue hym ſelfe to Cartynge (as they ſayde) and voluptuouſnes, when it was more expedient to reuenge them ſelues, vpon the Germay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and to punyſhe them, for theyr preſumptuouſe audacitye.</p>
            <p>There was then in the armye, one Maximinus, of a certayne Village of Thrace, and that the obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt wyth all,<note place="margin">Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus had been a ſhepherd</note> a man halfe Barbarous, whyche in his youthe, had bene a Shepherde, and after, hys yeares beynge encreaſed, for the heyghte of hys bodye, and hys myghtye ſtrengthe, was waged for a horſeman.

Wherfore being prone of their nature to chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of thinges, greued with ſo longe contynuaunce of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment (whereof they receyued lytle lucre) for that all ambition was longe before aboliſhed) and aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye truſtynge that ſome other Prynce which ſhoulde attayne vnto the Soueraignitie, without lokyng for it woulde beſtowe ſome more giftes, and honoure vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, thei concluded to murder Alexander, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwardes to create Maximinus Emperoure beyng their Companion in armes, and all other exercyſes, and by his ſkyl in warfarre, moſte apte for the warre preſently in hande. Wherfore hauing by ſundry ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des aſſembled into the fielde, when Maximinus came amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges them to inſtructe the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge Souldiours, they clothed hym with purple, and ſaluted hym as Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Doubtfull it is, wether he were ignoraunte of the dryfte, or els made pryuie vnto the matter before. At the fyrſt he refuſed it, and reiected the purple. But when he ſaw the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of armes drawe furth their ſwor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des, threating to kyll him, wiſhing rather the dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger to come, then the peryll preſente, he toke the honoure vpon hym: proteſtynge, that althoughe the ſame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,

were erſte by dreames, and viſions, ſhewed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, yet was he nowe vnwillyngly enforced by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to receiue it, onely becauſe he would obey their myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des. Then he wylled theim, to appoynte all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as they would them ſelues, and taking their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, in preuenting the rumor of this matter, goo ſlea Alexander (who was ignoraunt of all that was done) that thereby his Souldiours, &amp; the Garde of hys per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, beyng with the ſodeyne chaunce diſmaied, ſhould either willingly aſſent vnto them, or els beyng vnrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy, &amp; loking for no ſuche happe, ſhoulde maugre theyr heades, be brought in ſubiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then after he had en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>flamed their good willes towardes him, in dublynge their wages, and promiſyng to geue them greate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, &amp; to pardon all their punyſhmentes, he ledde them all vnto Alexanders Pauylio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, for that it was not farre diſtant fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence. When thieſe thinges were declared vnto Alexander, he was great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly diſmaied w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the noueltye thereof. So that he ran out of his Tent, as a mad man, weaping, &amp; tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling, now callyng Maximiuus deſloyall, and periured per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon, with reckening of the benefytes, which him ſelfe had beſtowed vpon him: and then, accuſing the yonge Souldiours, which neglecting their othe, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprice ſo perniciouſly, that facinorouſe facte. And fynally, he offered to giue them what thei woulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyre, and amende ſuche thinges as were amiſſe. Then the Souldiours which apartayned to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Garde of hys perſon, making ioyfull acclamacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnto him, promiſed to defende him, with all their might and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. When the night was ones paſſed, and the daye began to dawe, certaine of the Souldiours, brought worde vnto him, that Maximinus was at hande, for that they myght ſee the duſte rayſed, and heare the noyſe of a greate multitude not farre of. Wherefore Alexander came agayne into the fielde, &amp; called togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers his Souldiours, beſeaching them to ayde, and defende him, whome them ſelues had brought vp, and during whoſe raigne, by the ſpace of .xiiii. yeres, they had liued without diſcention. Then hauynge moued
<pb n="lxv" facs="tcp:4191:81"/>
them all with compaſſion, he willed theim to arme them ſelfes, &amp; ſtande in ordre of batayle, to reſyſt their enemies. But the Souldiours (althoughe thei had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore promiſed ayde vnto their Prince) dyd not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſhrincke away, by lytle, and litle. Some of theim required the Captaine of the Garde, &amp; other of Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders frendes to be put to deathe: alledginge that they were the occaſion of this Commocio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Other of them accuſed hys Moother, for that ſhe was a coueteous woman: who in heaping, and hording of money, and throughe her pynchynge, ſparynge, and greedy kea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, from the Souldiours, had broughte Alexander into dyſdayne wyth them all. Thus ſtode they tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng, and moued not as yet. But as ſoone as tharmy of Maximinus was in ſyghte, and after he had enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged them, to forſake a fylthy woman, and a weake yonge man, whiche lyued as yet vnder his Moothers commaundemente, and ioyne them ſelues vnto a ſtronge, and valeaunte man, theyr companion in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, and exercyſed contynually wyth them, in feates of warre, furthwith, thei all togethers reuoulted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Alexander, and with one aſſente ſaluted Maximinus as Emperour. Then Alexander fledde backe agayne into his Pauilion, trembling, and halfe beſydes hym ſelfe, and embraſyng his Moother, and (as it is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) blami<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g her for that he ſuffered this calamity, for her ſake, he aboade there, loking for the murderer.</p>
            <p>Now Maximinus, after he was created Emperour by thole Armye, gaue in charge to the Tribune,<note place="margin">Tribun.</note> and Capitaines, the murderinge of Alexander wyth hys Moother,<note place="margin">Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; hys Moother w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> theyr frendes ſlayne.</note> and all other whych ſhould make anye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyſtaunce. Thei furthwith entering by vyolence into the Pauilion, ſlew both Alexander, and his Moother, with hys frendes, and euerye noble man, excepte a fewe, whyche a lytle before had made ſhyfte for theim ſelues by fleeing away, and were hyd in corners. All the which, being ſhortly after apprehended, Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius dyd put to death.

For deteſting crueltye, and murder he permitted no man to ſuffer, withoute he were by iudgemente con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned, ſo muche was he addicted to gentle beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

            <p>Wherefore, fyrſte of all, he rooted oute of the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te houſe, all the frendes and Councelours of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of the whyche ſome he dimiſſed to Rome,<note place="margin">The ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> other ſome he depriued of theyr offyces, accuſynge their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer adminiſtration therein.

But his tyranny was more augmented, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the opening of a certayne conſpiracie agaynſt hym, wherin many of the Captaynes, &amp; the whole Se<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nate, were confedered.</p>
            <p>There was a certayne man of the nobilitie, which had been Conſul, named Magnus.<note place="margin">Magnus</note> The ſame was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed vnto Maximinus, that he had entended treaſon againſt him, &amp; perſuaded the Souldiours, to tranſlate the Empyre vnto him. Thys counſayle was ſuppoſed to be ſuche. Maximinus had made a Brydge ouer the ryuer, to paſſe agaynſt the Germayns, hauyng a gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy appetite (after he had gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thempyre) vnto warlike affayres. For being erected vnto Thempyre, through the huge quantitie of his bodie, his ſtrength, and ſkill in warfare, he endeuoured with open deades, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame opinion of the ſouldiours, to proue, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that the feare, cowardiſe, and ſlouth of Alexander, in warlyke exerciſes, was iuſtly by him condempned. Wherfore, he omitted nothynge that appertayned to the exerciſe of the men of warre. And beynge hym ſelfe daylye in armes, dyd therewith greatlye prouoke the courage of the Souldyours.</p>
            <p>After the aforeſayde Brydge was fynyſhed, he determined, to paſſe ouer into Germayne. But then it was reported, that Magnus had entiſed a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Souldiours, who excelled the other in prowes, eſpecially of thoſe, vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cuſtody of the Bridge was committed, that aſſone as Maximinus were paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto the other ſyde of the riuer, they ſhould throw downe the bridge, exclude him from all retourne, and thereby betray him vnto the Germains. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> depth, and breadeth of the Ryuer was ſuche, that it ſeamed vnpoſſible for hym to gette ouer agayne, eſpeciallye, becauſe there was no kynde of veſſell, on the further ſhore. Suche was the rumor of thys enterpryſe. But vncertayne it is, whether the ſame were truelye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
<pb n="lxxvii" facs="tcp:4191:83"/>
or els forged of a purpoſe. For it is hard, to giue a reſolute Iudgemente therein, bycauſe that wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oute anye tryall, aunſwere, or ſentence, as manye as were onelye ſuſpected, were putte vnto deathe.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, there began a great commotion, of the Oſrohenian Souldyours alſo. For they beynge verye ſorowfull for the deathe of Alexander, and by happe, meatynge wyth one of hys frendes,<note place="margin">Quarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> named Quarcinus (who a lytle before hadde been dimiſſed by Maximinus from the Campe) tooke hym agaynſte hys wyll, when he loked for no ſuche matter, elected hym to theyr Captayne, clothed hym wyth Purple, caryed the fyre before hym, and ſo adorned wyth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niciouſe honours, exalted hym vnto the dygnitie of Emperoure.</p>
            <p>The whyche man, ſhortelye after, ſleapynge in hys Pauilion, was by one of hys owne Companions, and (as it is ſuppoſed) hys frende, trayterouſlye murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The ſame was named Macedonius,<note place="margin">Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</note> whyche had been before, Ruler of the Oſrohenians, and at that preſent, was fyrſte Authour vnto them, of reuoltinge from Maximinus. And, althoughe there were no cauſe of grudge betwene him, and Quarcinus, yet dyd he thus murder hym, whome hym ſelfe had fyrſte compelled to become Emperour.</p>
            <p>Then thynkynge to ſhewe Maximinus ſome great pleaſure, he caried vnto hym the head of Quarcinus. But Maximinus, albeit he were glad of that facte, for that hys enemye was rydde oute of the waye, yet dyd he putte vnto extreame deathe thys Macedonius, (whych loked after ſome greate rewarde, and hoped to receaue great thankes for hys trauayle) becauſe he was Authour of the rebellion, and murderer of one, whyche hym ſelfe had induced, maugre hys head vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that miſchiefe, and had been falſe vnto the man, whyche had moſte affyaunce in hym.</p>
            <p>Theſe cauſes therfore, dyd exaſperate the mynde of Maximinus, and kyndled hys furye, beynge already? of hys owne nature, ouer prone vnto crueltye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4191:84"/>He was beſydes, horrible of viſage, &amp; of ſo huge, and myghty ſtature, that none of the moſt valiaunt Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, or moſte warlyke Barbariens myghte be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto hym.</p>
            <p>When theſe thynges were thus ſet in order, he ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together the whole Armye, paſſed wythoute feare ouer the Brydge, and made Battayle vpon the Germaynes. There folowed hym a wonderfull nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, almoſte all the power of the Barbariens, and wyth theym verye manye Mauritanian Slyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and Archers. There folowed hym beſydes, the Oſrohenians, and Armenians, the one nacion beinge ſubiecte vnto the Romaynes, the other aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in frendſhyppe wyth them, they were accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed wyth as manye Parthians, as beynge hyred or fugityues, from theyr natyue countrey, or els taken in the warres, ſerued the Romaynes.</p>
            <p>Thys multytude of people, was fyrſte leuyed by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander, &amp; then augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, and exerciſed, by Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus. The Slyngers, and Archers, ſeamed verye pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytable in the warre agaynſte the Germayns, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they coulde eaſelye ſtryke theyr enemyes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and recule theym ſelues furthewyth, into ſure defence.</p>
            <p>Maximinus beynge entred wythin hys ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes lande, and fyndynge no man to reſiſt hym (for all the Germaines were fledde) pylled and foraged the countreye (the Corne beynge then rype) and permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Souldyours to burne, and deſtroye, all the Vyllages. And in deade, the Townes and houſes there, are verye muche ſubiecte to daunger of fyre. For amonges the Germaynes, the Buyldynge wyth Stone, and Tyle, is verye rare and ſcarce. But wyth great peices of Tymber ſet in the earthe, and Ioyned together in thycke woodes,<note place="margin">The Ger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maynes houſes.</note> they make (as it were) tabernacles. Maximinus then goynge forwardes, in waſtynge the Countrey, ſackyng the corne, and diſtributynge the Cattell, whyche was taken amonges the Souldyours, founde not as yet, anye of hys enemyes. For they had abondoned all the
<pb n="lxxviii" facs="tcp:4191:84"/>
fielde, playne, Countrey, and all places, deſtitute of trees, and hydde them ſelues couertly in the woodes, and mariſhes, that thei myght there fyght, and with ſodeyne aſſaultes, inuade their enemyes: becauſe the thickeneſſe, and nygh growing togither of the trees, ſeemed to become a great impediment vnto the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, and dartes, of theyr enemies. And thei thought, that the depth of their maryſhes, and Pooles, would be dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerouſe vnto the Romaynes, for that thei were ignoraunte of the paſſages, and Countrey. But vnto themſelues, very eaſye, and profytable, becauſe they wading daily through them, vp to the knees, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knewe, whiche were the paſſable foordes, &amp; whiche vnpoſſible to get ouer. And truly, the Germaines are verye cunnynge in ſwymming, as men, which one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwymme, and bathe them ſelues in Ryuers. In theiſe places therfore, was the battayle begon, where fyrſte of all the Romayne Emperour enterpryſed the confllycte very valiauntly. For when thei were come vnto a greate, &amp; broade Maryſhe, within the which, the Germaines had retyred them ſelues, the Romai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, beinge afearde to purſue their enemyes, Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius fyrſte entered vpon a great Courſer, into the Maryſhe (wher his horſe fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dered to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> belye) &amp; ſlewe with great ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>hode, many of the Barbarous people, whyche reſyſted. Wherefore the reſydue of tharmye, beynge pricked wyth ſhame, yf they ſhoulde forſake their Emperour, nowe fyghtynge for them, aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured theim ſelues alſo into the Maryſhe. And then were there ſlayne, many of eyther parte, but ſo, that there was no Barbarien lefte a lyue, the Romayne Emperour fyghtynge moſte valyauntlye. Whereby the Maryſhe beynge fylled wyth deade carcaſes, and the lake beynge myngled wyth bloode, cauſed it to ſeame, that thys foote Battayle was foughte wyth ſhyppes vppon the water.</p>
            <p>This victory, wyth other hys ſtoute, and mightye factes, he not onely ſygnifyed vnto the Senate, and people of Rome, by letters, but alſo beynge Printed in a great Table, cauſed it to be publyſhed before the

            <p>The ſame Table, with the reſte of hys honours, the Senate afterwardes pullyd downe, and abolyſhed.

There folowed hym alſo a great number of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, not to be neglected, whome he had eyther by force ſubdued, or els aſſociated in amitie vnto hym.

Wherfore he determined to ſend before, the Pannonian bandes, in whome he had great confidence, whiche alſo fyrſte ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted him for Emperour, and willyngly attempted all perylles for hys ſaufegarde.

            <p>But whyles Maximinus was thus in hys iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, his affaires had better ſucceſſe in Carthage, then he loked for. For there was a certayn man named Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellianus,<note place="margin">Capelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus Mauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania.

Betwene this Capellianus, and Gordyan, there was muche diſcencion, aboute a certayne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie in the lawe. Wherefore, after Gordian had obtayned the name of Emperour, he ſente one to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceade Capellianus in hys office, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded him to depart from the rule of the Prouince. But he diſday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng therat, &amp; beyng true to hys Prince (of whom he had receaued that dignitie) gathered all the power he had together. And after he had exhorted them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewe theyr trueth, and othe of allegiaunce, he remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued towardes Carthage, leadynge wyth hym a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull

            <p>When it was declared vnto Gordyan, that Capel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianus was commynge towardes Carthage, bothe hym ſelfe, was ſtryken wyth a ſodeyne tremblynge feare, and all the Carthagynenſſes greatly diſmayed, who in a dyſordered heape wythoute anye warelyke order (yet hauinge hope of victorye) thruſte themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues forwardes oute of the Cytye, to meete wyth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellianus.</p>
            <p>The olde man Gordian (as ſome reporte) aſſone as Capellianus approched to the Cytye, deſpayring of al good hope, becauſe he perceaued Maximine to haue a greate power of men then in Affrica remaynynge, hanged hym ſelfe.

The Carthagynenſes were many more in number, but yet out of order, and vnſkylfull in the warres, and being effeminated with bankettes of voluptuouſnes, wanted weapons, and all other warrelyke inſtrumentes.</p>
            <p>For no man brought out of his houſe, any other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, then eyther a Dagger, a Hatchet, or a Huntynge ſtaff, or els a Speare hardened in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fyre, as they could get for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> defence of their bodies.

Wherfore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Carthaginenſes were eaſely repulſed, &amp; conſtrained to flye.

For of ſo greate a number, whyche fledde, there entered but verye fewe into the Citye agayne, who ſaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, by lurkyng, in darke, and vnknowen corners.

            <p>There be whych reporte, that as ſoone as Gordia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus (who for hys age abode wythin hys owne houſe) hearde that Capellianus was entered into the Cytye, diſpairyng of hys ſafegarde, went into hys chamber, as thoughe he woulde ſleape, and wyth hys Gyrdle whych he had about hym, hanged hym ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Thys was the eande of Gordianus, who was fortunate in the former parte of hys lyfe, and nowe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Then Capellianus entred into Carthage, &amp; ther put vnto deathe, euerye one of the noble men, whyche re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned oute of the furye of the Battayl. Neyther dyd he abſtayne, from the ſpoylynge of the Temples, and ranſackynge all Publyke, and priuate Treaſures, And goyng vnto other Cityes, whyche had abolyſhed the honours of Maximinus, the chiefeſt therin he put to deathe, and the reſte he afflycted wyth tormentes: permyttyng the Souldyours, to burne, and robbe, the Vyllages, &amp; Fyeldes therabout, vnder a pretence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengynge Maximinus: but yet priuelye allurynge the Souldyous heartes vnto hym ſelfe, to the eande, that if Maximinus ſped not wel, him ſelfe might haue the Souldyours good wylles, for the obtaynynge of the Empyre.

Affrica. But after y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the death of Gordian was heard of in Rome, a meruaylouſe terrour enuaded the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, &amp; people of Rome, for that he was loſt, in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, all their hope, was ſytuate.

            <p>Thei aſſembled therefore, I ſaye, not in the Coorte as thei were wonte before, but in the Temple of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter Capitolyne, the whyche beynge buylded in the higheſt place of the Citie, the Romaines haue in moſt eſtimacion.

In that conflicte were all the Sworde players ſlayne, and a greate number of the people, thruſte to death in the preſſe.

In the meane whyle, there were daylye ſkyrmyſſhes, and aſſaultes, at the walles of the fortreſſe, but to no purpoſe, nor proffyte, the Souldyours, defending them ſelues from aboue, and driuing away ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullye, the common people, whyche they ſtrake, and wounded.</p>

            <p>Finallye, when the aſſaultes proceaded not, as the people woulde haue it, it ſeamed good to their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, to turne away, al the Riuers, &amp; waters, which came by Cundittes into the Campes, that the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyours myght be afflicted wyth wante of water, and wyth thyrſte.

And hauing brought all impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimentes, and Cariage, into the myddes, him ſelfe fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, with the Yeome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his Garde, to reſcue them, yf they were diſtreſſed.

And (yf nede ſo required, he had rather, thoſe Barbarous, &amp; rude people, were loſte, than any other of his owne Souldiours.</p>
            <p>After thei had paſſed the plaines, obſeruing theyr due order in marchinge, they came to a cytie of Ita<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lye, named of the enhabitauntes Eumona.<note place="margin">Eumo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</note> The ſame is ſytuate in a lowe playne, at the foote of the Alpes.</p>
            <p>There, the Scourers reported vnto Maximinus, that the Towne was voide, and forſaken of thenhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauntes, who were all ſledde, the gates of the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, and the houſes, conſumed wyth fyre, and all thynge,

            <p>Wherwith Maximinꝰ was veri glad: for he thought, that other people, wold doo ſemblably, through feare of him. But contrarywyſe, the Souldiours murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and grudged, that they ſhould in the very begyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, be vexed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> famine.

            <p>After thei had paſſed the Alpes, and were deſcended into their Campe, thei began to reioyce, and ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quet, together.

But when he came vnto the Ryuer, whyche runneth xii. miles of from the Cytye, he found it of a very depe and breade Channell. For in that ſeaſon of the yeare, the Snowe (which the longe wynter before, cauſed to endure) beyng molten vpon the next hylles, had made ſo great a floude, that the Armye coulde not paſſe ouer it, by anye meanes. For the Aquileians had broken, and caryed away the Bridge, which was a goodly and ſumptuous peace of worke, buylded by the auncyent Emperours, of ſquare ſtone, with many ſmall pillers ſtanding one by another vpon the ſame. Wwherfore when tharmie coulde paſſe ouer, neyther by Bridge, nor veſſell (for there was none nigh hand) he ſtode ſtyl in a dumpe, muſyng what to do. But certayne Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes, being ignoraunt, wyth what ſwyftnes, and
<pb n="ci" facs="tcp:4191:99"/>
violence, the Ryuers of Italye did runne, &amp; ſuppoſing that theyr courſe was gentle, and flow ouer the fields, as the Riuers in theyr Countrey (which for that they haue no ſwift ſtreame, are eaſlye congeled ouer wyth Iſe) aduentured them ſelues, &amp; their horſes that were perfect in ſwimming, into the middes of the Cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nell: where, throughe vyolence of the Streame, they were drowned. After Maximinus had lyen ſtyll in Campe, ii. or .iii. dayes, he caſt a depe trenche aboute the ſame, that no enemies ſhoulde ſodeynly ſet vpon them, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned vpon that ſide of the Riuer, conſulting howe he myght make a Bridge to paſſe ouer. Whyles he ſo abode very penſife, becauſe there was no tymber, nor Boates with the whiche ioyned together, he myghte make a Bridge, certayne Carpenters declared vnto hym, that in the Vyllages rounde aboute, forſaken of the Inhabitauntes, there were many round Tubbes and Hoggeſheades, wherin the people were wonte to cary wyne: the which beinge rounde like ſhyppes, yf they were bounde togethers, in maner of ſmall Boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, would eaſly carye them ouer. For being faſtened togethers, couered with Oziars, or Twigges, &amp; well baleſſed with earth, they would neuer be drowned. When y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was finiſhed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſouldiours eaſlye paſſed ouer to thother ſhore. And there, hauing burned al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which they founde abandoned of thin habitau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, did cut down all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vines, &amp; trees, wherby they greatly defaced y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beauty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> region. For all the countrey ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſed aboute, in maner of a Theater, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> trees ſet in due order, &amp; vynes ioyned together, lyfted vp in height like vnto a Scaffold. Al which being pluc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rootes, tharmie approched nigh vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> citie. Neuertheles becauſe they were all wery, The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perour would not y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould furthw<hi rend="sup">t</hi> begyn y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſſault. But hauing enca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ped, more then an arrowes ſhoote fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Citie, deuided the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into hundreds, appoynted the order of their marching like vnto a wedge, ſmal before, and broade behinde, &amp; limitting to euery Company, a part of the wall, to ſcale, and batter, he gaue them lycence to recreate them ſelues, for one daye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4191:100"/>That paſſed, he began to geue the aſſault, and hauing moued to the wall, all ſortes of engyns, when no kynd of Batterie was omitted, there was almoſt euery day cruell ſkyrmyſhes fought. For the Souldyours enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned the walles, as it were with a toyle, or nette, and fought with muche ſtoutnes of ſtomacke. And on the contrarye parte, the Aquileiens reſyſted verye va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liauntlye: who hauynge ſhutte the dores of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and houſes, dyd all together, wyth theyr wyues, and Children, vpon the walles, Towers, and Batyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, defende theyr Cytye. Neyther was there any age, whiche refuſed to fyghte for their Countrey. Maximinus then pulled downe al the Suburbes, and whatſoeuer buyldynge was without the Cytye, with the tymber wherof, he made all kynde of engyns, and inſtrumentes, wherwith he might batter the walles, or at leaſt wyſe, ſome part therof, whereby the armye myght enter into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cytye, and in ſpoylyng, ſackyng, and defacynge, the ſame, leaue it deſolate, and voyde of habitation. For he thoughte it y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> woulde be againſt his honour, to go vnto Rome, before he had deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Cytye, which fyrſt reſiſted him in Italy.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, he rode wyth hys Sonne, whome he had ioyned vnto hym in the Empyre, amonges the Souldyours, promyſyng them many good morowes, and exhortynge theym, to ſtande lyke menne to theyr tacklynge.</p>
            <p>But the Cytezyns of Aquileia, threw downe great ſtones vpon them. And hauing fylled verye many La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels with Brimſtone,<note place="margin">A ſore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe.</note> Lyme, and Pitche, as ſoone as the Souldyours began to ſcale the wals, they powred downe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſo ſaue, that it ſeamed violent ſhowres.

Then a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mighte ſee the Souldiours, throwe away their owne harneſſe. Which thing, haui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g a colour, that thei were diſpoyled by the vanquiſſhers) was inuented, rather by ſubtlitie of arte, then force of batayle. Whereby it
<pb n="cii" facs="tcp:4191:100"/>
happened, that many of the Souldiours, eyther loſte theyr ſyghte, or elles had their faces, and other bare partes of their bodies, burned. The Aquileye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s threw downe alſo, into their Towres, &amp; engins of woode, many torche ſtraues, couered wyth Roſen, and pitch, whoſe endes, were ſharpened, with heades, lyke vnto arowes: whyche beyng kindeled, and ſticked faſte in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Timber worke, dyd eaſely ſet all on fyre. That notwithſtanding, the fyrſte daies, the fortune was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall on eyther ſyde. But anon after, the courage of Maximinus armye dyd aſwage, and becauſe theyr hope was fruſtrate, and had deceiued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thei wexed euery day more peſife then other. For thoſe, who thei before ſuppoſed, wold not abyd the brunt firſt of theyr force, thei nowe perceiued, not onely, not to ſhrincke, but alſo, to reſyſte valeau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tely. Contrariwyſe, the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes of the Aquilenſes, were daylye, more, and more enhaunſed. And hauinge, thrugh vſe, obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, bothe thexperte feate of fyghtinge, and therwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all manfull corage, thei ſo deſpyſed the Souldiours, that they mocked them, with ieſtyng at Maximinus, when he came nighe vnto the walles, and bluſtering oute, many opprobrious tau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes againſt him, and his Sone. Wherewith he being chaufed, when he could not auenge him ſelfe vppon hys enemyes, he put to cruel death, many of his own Capitaines: alleging, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thei had nor like valeaunte men, and true ſubiectes, done their full endeuour, in the aſſaultinge of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye. Wherby it came to paſſe, that the Souldiours be came more angry towardes hym: And his enemyes, had him in more contempt, and deriſion. It chaunſed beſydes, that the Aquileyens abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with plenty of vitayle, and all other neceſſaries. For what ſo euer was expedient, to the ſuſtenaunce of men, and horſes, the ſame was before hande brought into the Citye. On thother ſyde, the armye languiſhed with penury of foode. And after all the trees were cut downe, and the fieldes waſted, ſome of the Souldiours lay in Cab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bans, ſuch as thei could for haſte make, and other ſom in the open fieldes, ſubiect to the heate of the Sonne,
<pb facs="tcp:4191:101"/>
and the weatenes of the Rayne. Neyther was there anye kynde of noryſhmente, broughte vnto theim, for them ſelues, or their cattell. For all the wayes, and paſſages, were by the diligence of the Romaines, ſhut vp with greate walles, and Gates. The Senate alſo, had ſente certayne Senatours, with a companie of armed perſonnes, choſen oute of all Italye, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende the Shores, and Hauens, geuing no man lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to ſayle. So that all thinges done at Rome, were kept cloſe, from the eares of Maximine. All the highe way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es beſydes, and Bypathes, were diligently watched, that no man ſhould paſſe by them. So it came to paſſe, that the Armye, whiche beſyeged the Towne, was it ſelfe alſo encloſed rounde aboute. For thei coulde ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take Aquileia, nor paſſe forward towards Rome, through wante of ſhyppes, and wagons, whiche were all before hande taken vp by the Romaines. The ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor alſo thrughe ſuſpicion augmented, that all the Romayne people, were already in Armes, and that Italy, with all the Illyrian, and Barbarous nacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, whiche enhabyte the Eaſte, and Southe Contreys, had wyth one conſent, conſpyred, to ioyne together, a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainſt Maximinus, for the deſpyte, and grudge, they bare vnto hym. Wherefore, the Souldiours fell into diſpayre of good hope, beyng afflicted, wyth ſcarcetye of all thinges, and hauyng no water, but ſuch, as thei drew out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ryuer, which was defiled with bloode, and deade Carcaſes. For the Aquileyens, threwe into the Ryuer, ſuch deade bodies, as thei coulde not bury. And thoſe whyche periſhed with ſworde, or ſicknes, in the Campe, were throwen into the Ryuer lykewyſe. Amonges whome, there were many, whyche died by famin, hauing when thei were drowned, ſome breath remaynynge.</p>
            <p>Whyles the Army aboade thus ſorowfull, voyde of all ſuccoure, ſodeinly, when Maximinus reſted in hys Pauilion, one daye vacant from batayle, and all the Souldiours, were gone to reſte theim ſelues, in theyr Cabans, and Tentes, the men at Armes, which had theyr Stacions, within the Citye of Rome, vnder
<pb n="ciii" facs="tcp:4191:101"/>
the Hyll Alban, and therin, their wiues, &amp; childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, and agreed, to ſlea Maximyne: that thei might be ones exempt, from that longe, &amp; inexplicable ſyege of the Cytye, and mouing of warre againſt Italy, for the loue of a Tiraunt, who was abhorred of all men.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, taking corage vnto them, about none<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyde, thei wente to his Pauilion, the yeomen of hys Garde, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiring together with them. And there, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thei hadde pulled downe hys Images, thei ſlewe hym, and hys Sonne, when they came furthe,<note place="margin">The deth of Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus &amp; his Son.</note> to ſpeke vnto the Souldiours: and with them, the lord great Maiſter of his houſe, and all his deareſt fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des. And then threw their bodies furth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> deſpite, leuyng them, to be deuoured of Dogges, and Byrdes: ſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding onely the two Emperours heades vnto Rome. This eande of lyfe, had Maximinus, with his Son, both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyuinge condigne punyſhmente, of their yll ordered gouernaunce. At the firſt tidinges, of the two Pryn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces death, the Army ſtode ſtyll, amaſed, &amp; vncertayne what thei might doo. For it was not equally accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto them all, eſpeciallye not vnto the Pano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and Barbarous Thracians, who hadde dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the Empyre, vnto Maximinus. But when they perceiued that the deade coulde not be vndone, they helde them ſelues contented althoughe vnwillingly, and fayned to reioyce with the reſte. Then, layeng a ſyde their weapons, thei went to the walles of Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leye, lyke peaceable me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and there declaring the death of Maximyne, deſyred that the Gates might be ſet ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them, beyng nowe of their mortall enemyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their louing frendes. But the Capitaynes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quileia, would not permyt it, but ſhewed furth vppon the walles, the Images of Maximus, Albinus, and Gordian, Emperours, crowned with Garlandes of Lawrell. Vnto the which Images, them ſelues fyrſte making ioyful acclamacions, exorted the Army alſo, to acknowledge, and reuerence them, whome the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and people of Rome, hadde choſen to be Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
            <p>For, ſaid thei, the other Gordians before paſſed, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monges
<pb facs="tcp:4191:102"/>
the Goddes. They did ſet furth alſo vpon the walles, a market of all neceſſaries, with greate abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunce of meate, wyne, garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, and all other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which that riche, and floriſhing Cytie, could mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter vnto them. That thing, did meruelouſly abaſhe the Souldiours: who perceyued, that the Cytezins, had ſtore ynoughe of vitayll, to abyde a farre longer ſeage. And on the other ſide, them ſelues, being afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with wante of foode, ſhould rather haue all peryſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, than conquered that Citie, abounding wyth all thinges expedient for mans relief. Whyles the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours thus aboade vnder the walles, and tooke ſuch thinges, as their neceſſitie required, in companye of the Citezins, their countenaunce was of peace, and frendſhip, a forme of ſiege, as yet remaining, for that the Romayne Souldiours, laye aboute the walles whiche were encloſed, and ſhut. In the meane while, that theiſe thinges were in doing at Aquileya, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horſe men, which caried the Emperours heades to Rome, making great haſte, with ſpedy diligence, were recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into euery Citie, and Town, with the gates ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the multitude of Citezins, and enhabitauntes, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rynge Lawrell in their handes. And then hauinge paſſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Mariſhes, &amp; Lakes, whiche are betwene Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinum,<note place="margin">Altinum. Rauenna Maximꝰ.</note> &amp; Rauenna, thei founde Maximus in Rauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, leuieng, &amp; waging Souldiours out of the Citye, and Italy, and calling a great number of Germains vnto his ayde, the which were ſent him, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people of Germany, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he before in his Proconſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip amonges them, had prudentely gouerned.</p>
            <p>Whiles he was thus muſtering his power againſt Maximine, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> arriued ther ſode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>li, bringing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes heades, &amp; declared y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victory, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perouſe ſucceſſe of their affaires, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good wil, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſet, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, &amp; Army, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obediece of thoſe Emperors, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate had elected.

            <p>
               <pb n="ciiii" facs="tcp:4191:102"/>Then Maximus after the ſacryfyce eanded, diſmiſſed, the horſmen to Rome, to cary thither, the ſayd heades, and declare the whole circumſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, vnto the people. When they were ariued at the Cytye, and hauynge putte the heades vpon twoo Speares, caried the ſame throughe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtreates, to be ſeane of the people, no tonge can tell, the ioye, and myrth was there that daye. For there was no perſon, eyther yonge, or olde, but ranne vnto the Temples, and Aulters.</p>
            <p>No man abode within hys owne houſe, but ranne lyke madde men, ſhoutynge, and reioyſynge one with an other, and gatherynge theym ſelues together, in a circle, as thoughe ſome manne woulde make an Oration vnto them. Albinus hym ſelfe offered an hun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dreth beaſtes, and all the Magiſtrates, reioyſed aboue meaſure, as though they had eſcaped y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> axe, whych be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore henge ouer theyr neckes. Purſeuau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, &amp; Poſtes, were ſente beſydes, wyth Laurell in theyr handes, to beare thoſe newes vnto all the Prouinces.</p>
            <p>Whyle thys ſo great ioye, and myrthe, continued amonges the Romaynes, Maximus remoued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenna, and went vnto Aquileia: hauyng paſſed al the Maryſhes, in the whyche the Ryuer Eridanus, and the nyghe Lakes, doth ouerflowe, ſo that they runne into the Sea, by .vii. armes, and therefore, the nyghe enhabitauntes, cal the ſame Lake, in theyr tonge .vii. Seas. Furthwith the Aquileiens opened their gates, and receaued Maximus. And verye manye Cytyes of Italye, ſente theyr chiefe Magiſtrates, as Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors vnto him, clothed in white garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, &amp; crowned wyth Laurell, bringinge with theym, the Images of theyr Countrey Goddes, and Crownes of Golde, yf there were any, amonges their chiefeſt Iewels: wher withall, they gratified Maximus, and ſtrowed bowes to him in his paſſage. The armye which had beſieged Aquileia, mette hym alſo, in peaceable apparell, wyth Laurell in their handes: but not with ſo trewe and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng affection, as with a fayned good wyll, and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, for the tyme onelye, applyed vnto the preſente ſtate, of the Prince.

that he whom they had choſen was ſlayne: &amp; thoſe whyche the Senate had created, poſſeſſed the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palytie.</p>
            <p>After Maximus had ſpente the firſt, &amp; ſecond daye, in offering of ſacrifice, the thyrd day he aſſembled al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> army, together in the playne, &amp; there ſitting in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal ſeate, made thys Oration vnto them.</p>

            <p>But notwithſtanding that the Empire were gouer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned bothe openly and priuely, with much modeſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie, euerye man ſpake well of it, and all the people were gladde wyth the Prynces, for that they were noble men borne, &amp; worthye Thempyre, yet the ſpyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and crabbed ſtomackes of the Pretorian Souldy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, could not wel abide, to heare thoſe ioyfull pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the people, but grudged, &amp; murmured agaynſte that nobilitye: beynge ſore greued, that the Prynces were created by the Senate. Theyr grudge was augmented, by reaſon of the Germaynes, whome Maximus retayned wyth hym in the Cytye.</p>
            <p>For they thoughte, that the Germaynes woulde worke theym myſchiefe, yf they attempted any great enterpryſe.</p>
            <p>They feared alſo treaſon, leſt perhaps they ſhoulde be put out of ſeruice, for their ſakes: beinge mindfull of Seuerus the Emperour, who diſcharged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theyr lyuynges, all the Slears of Pertynax.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:4191:104"/>Wherfore, one daye, when playes were celebrated in the Capitole, and mens mindes addicted vnto reuels, and paſtyme, ſodeynly the Souldiours did manifeſtly ſhewe furthe, theyr longe diſſimuled rancour.

            <p>It happened then (as the Diuell woulde haue it) that them ſelues agreed not very wel togethers.

            <p>For when Maximus, hearynge that the Pretorian Souldyours were comme to ſlea hym, determyned to cal for the ayde of the Germayns, whyche were in the Citie, &amp; ſeamed able ynoughe, to withſtande the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torians, Albinus, ſuſpecting ſome deceyte to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt hym (becauſe he knewe that the Germay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes fauoured Maximus) prohybyted them to be ſent for: deniynge, that they were called to reſyſte the Pretorians, but onely to the entent Maximus might obtayne the rule him ſelfe alone.</p>

               <p>Alexander the grete, was the Sone of Philyp, king of Macedonye, and Olympias. In his tender age, he was enſtructed in learning. And after that, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace of .x. yeres, brought vp in Philoſophy, vnder Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the moſt excellent Philoſopher of all his time.

The Prouinces, and Countreyes, by him Conquered, did Perdicas, (vnto whome at his deathe withoute any more wordes, he delyuered hys Rynge) diſtribute amonges many Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours: who altered their offices of gouernau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, in to Royaulnes, and made them ſelues Kynges. And ſo was Thempyre of Alexander broughte into manye Kyngedomes. The reſydue of hys lyfe, ye maye rede in Plutarche, and Quintus Curtius.</p>
               <p>Alexandrye, whereof Herodian ſpeaketh in the thirde Booke, is a Citye of Siria, hard by a reflexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sea, called Sinus Iſſicus, wherefore loke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thieſe wordes, Iſſicus Sinus. There is an other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye called Alexandrye, in the Region of Troas, where Troye the greate ſtode, as Plinie writeth, in the .xxx. Chapiter of hys .v. Booke.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:4191:106"/>Anonter Cytye, named Alerandrie, is in Egypte, ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate vpon the Sea ſide, oueraneanſte the Iſle Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, as ſayth Plinie in the .xxxi. Chapiter of the ſame boke. Thys Cytye is the principall of all Egypte, as London is of England. Into the whiche Ptolomeus the kyng of Egypte, deſyred to be remitted by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, as it appeareth by many Epiſtles, of Cicero, vnto Lentulus, in the fyrſte booke of hys familiar Epiſtles. Of thys Cytye, doth Herodian make menci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the .iiii. booke of his Hiſtorye, and of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wrought agaynſt the Citezins thereof, by Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyne. There is another Cytye named Alexandrie, by the mountaynes of Caſxij, in the Realme of Sogdia, nygh vnto the Bactrians, whych hath on the South the mountaigne Cacauſus. Another Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drie, buyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded lykewyſe by Alexander the great, ſtandeth in the Region called Margiana, of a Ryuers name, whiche is Margus. The ſame hathe on the Weſt ſide Hir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cania, on the Eaſt the Bactrians, and on the South, the Realmes of Parthia, and Aria. Thys Citie was deſtroyed by the Barbarous people, and in the ſame place was a new buylded, by Seleucus the Sonne of Antiochus, who named it Seleucia, as recordeth Pli<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nie, in the xvi. Chapyter of his .vi. boke. Another citie called Alexandrie, in the Countreye of Carmania in Inde, boundynge vpon Perſia. Of theiſe Cityes and countreyes loke Ptolomeus and Plinie.</p>

               <p>Amphitheater, is a place made to behold plaies in, the which is in fourme round, as yf it were buylded of .ii. Theaters, and therfore is called Amphitheater. A Theater is made halfe in compaſſe, betwene the ij. corners wherof, is played that whiche men behold, called of the Latinyſtes Scena. The nexte place vnto it, is called Orcheſtra, where the Senatours &amp; ſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge Ambaſſadours do ſit. In the middes of the Theater, are the Seates for Knightes, and that place, is named Canea. Rounde aboute the Theater withinfurth are degrees, and ſteppes, ſo made, that the hygher they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, the longer, and larger they are. Vpon the which

y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people do ſit, as euery man can get him place. Marcꝰ Scaurus (as witneſſeth Plinie in the .xxxiii. boke, the xv. chap.) for one Playe, which endured .xxx. dayes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, dyd buylde a Theater, the greateſt of all other, that were euer made by mans handes. The Scene where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, was of thre ſtages, &amp; had .iii.C.lx. Pyllers of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Affrique: of the whiche, the higher were of one piece, and xxxviii. fote in height. The lower parte of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Scene was of Marble, and the ſtage in the myddes of Glaſſe, which neuer man heard of before. There was beſydes, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more gorgious beautyfyeng of it .iii.M. Images of Copper, with ſo much rycheſſe, Tapiſtrie of golde, and Tables of auncient &amp; notable pictures, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is almoſte incredible to beleue, as wryteth Plinie. The greeces wheron men ſate in the ſame, did receiue lxxx.M. perſons. Caius Iulius Ceſar, fyrſt of all, buil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ded an Amphitheater, in the fyelde called Campus Martius: whyche Auguſtus pulled downe, and in the ſame place, made a Tombe.</p>
               <p>Antioche, is a parte of Siria, boundynge vpon the Royalme of Cilicia, as ſayeth Plinie, in the xii. chap. of hys fyfth boke. In thys part, is a Cytye of the ſame name, as wryteth Ptolomeus, in the fourth Table of Aſya. Thys is the Cytye, to the whyche Antonyne went, and from thence, to Alexandrie in Egypt. Ther is another Antyoche in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey of Aſſyrya, where Alexander vanquyſhed Darius: the whych is next vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to Syrya (as wytneſſeth Plinye, in the .xiij. chapyter of hys .vi. boke.

               <p>¶Tribune is aſmuch to ſaye, as Maiſter, Gouernour, or Capitayne. And it commeth of this word Tribus, for that the people of Rome, was fyrſt deuyded into partes, which they called Tribus. And the chiefe Gouernours and Capitaines of the men at armes, elected out of thoſe partes, were called Tribuni, as ſaith Varro treatinge of the Latyn tonge ſaith. Vegecius in the .iij. boke, &amp; the vij. chap. of the feates of warre. A Tribune of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, had the charge of a band in an armie, wherin were as many horſmen as fote men. As of the fyrſt Cohort of a Legion: which Cohorte, was the greateſt, the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and the beſt fylled wyth ſage, diſcret, valyaunt, and experte warryous. In the ſame were .xi.C. fote men, and .C.xxxij. men at armes on horſebacke.</p>
               <p>The Capytayne of thys Cohorte, was called the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune of the men at armes: who had vnder hym other Capytaynes, and Centuryons, as well of fotemen, as of horſemen. The other Cohortes of a Legion, whyche were nyne, leſte then the fyrſte, were conducted eyther by the Trybunes, or by the Prouoſtes. Budeus in hys commentarye vpon the Pandectes, or Digeſtes, ſayeth that we maye call a Trybune of men at armes, a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall. Vegecius in the ſeconde booke, the twelueth cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyter, ſayeth, that the honour of the Trybune of men at armes, was when the men at armes were honeſtly, and
<pb facs="tcp:4191:120"/>
cleanelye apparelled, well armed, and theyr harnes wel fourbyſhed, and ſhynynge bryghte, and when they were well enſtructed, &amp; exerciſed in the feates of warre. The aucthorytye and power of thys Magyſtrate, was for a whyle ſo greate, that the Trybunes of the men at armes, had ones the gouernau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and adminiſtration, of the Romayne common wealthe. And there was no Magyſtrate, or Dygnytye more hygher then thys. When there were no Conſulles, whyche was aboute thre ſcore and ten yeres, after the kynges were expelled oute of Rome, the Common weale was ruled fiue yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res by the Trybunes. After the fyue yeares were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyred, Conſulles were agayne created, as ſayeth Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponyus Letus. Dyuers tymes the Trybunes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored vnto dygnytye agayne, as ſayth Tytus Liuius, and they had the aucthorytye of the Conſulles.</p>
               <p>Fyrſte they were thre, then foure, then tenne, and then twentye, ſome tyme leſſe, ſome tyme more. In Rome there were other Trybunes, whiche were named Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes of the people, who were created the yeare, that Aul is Virginus, &amp; Titus Vetuſius Geminius, were Conſulles, whyche was the .xvi. yeare after the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kinges. At which time the common people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge ouercharged, and vexed wyth debtes (after that the Senatours and noble men of Rome, had often ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes promyſed to releaſe, and diſcharge theym thereof, and then deceyued theym) ſeperated them ſelues from the Senatours. But Menenius Agrippa, one of the tenne Ambaſſadours ſente vnto the people, whyche were aſſembled in the fielde, reduced them by an oracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into amitye, created y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tribunes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, who were choſen out of the common people them ſelues. This dig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nite was ſacred, &amp; inuiolable, not ſubiect vnto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulles, as other officers were. The Tribunes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple ſate in the Senate houſe, at the very entry thereof. And that, that the Conſulles decreed, their ſometyme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and ſometime reiected. And bicauſe thei vpheld, and mayntained the people, and ſtyrred them oftenty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mes againſte the Senatours, and noble men of Rome, there raſe many Ciuyle batayles betwene them. In the
<pb facs="tcp:4191:121"/>
tyme of the Kinges, there were Tribunes whiche were Captaines of a hundred horſemen, and were called Tri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>buni Celerum. Ther were alſo other Tribunes which had the Charge of the Receit, &amp; Cuſtody, of all Trybute money, and were called Tribuni Aerarij, as muche to ſaye, as the Tribunes of the Treſoure.</p>
