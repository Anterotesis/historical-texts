            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And the fourth Angel poured out his Vial on the Sunne, and it was given unto him to torment men with fire. And men boyled in great heat, and blaſphemed the name of God, which hath power ouer theſe plagues, and they repented not, to giue him glory.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough I am not worthy to be named with Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> yet I truſt I may crave leave under correction, to differ from him in the expoſition of this Viall; I proſecute his memory with all the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction that is due to ſo great a light in the Church of God, and behold himſelf (for his clearing of this Apocalyps) the chief Angel of this Viall, in caſe it be meant of Proteſtant Writers (as he would have it) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Scripture as clear as the Sun, to the confounding and tormenting of the Papiſts. Howbeit there be ſome reaſons that lead me to interpret it rather of the waſting of ſome Proteſtant or Lutheran State, not long hence to be accompliſhed, which I crave liberty to ſet down.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the confounding and tormenting of the Papiſts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by the Scripture, is not a diſtinct particular event, as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of this fourth Viall ſeemeth to be; diſtinct it is not, but the ſame with the plague of the firſt Viall, whoſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:58666:4"/>
botch, what is it elſe, but an Ulcer of minde in the Papiſts, to ſee the grouth of the Goſpel, and the fall of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, eſpecially here at home in England, by the death of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and the ſucceſſion of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the Crown; And it is generall, whereas this Viall poured is poured on the Sunne, a particular Starre in the heaven, to note a plague on ſome ſpeciall State of ſome true Church, or at the leaſt ſome Church diſunited from Popery.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the Sunne being King among Starres <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.17. He fitly here deſigneth ſome King or State, even as he doth elſe where; ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> (the moſt heroicall man in his dayes) is reſembled to the Sunne, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. and <hi>David</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.17. and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.11. Who is the Angel ſtanding in the Sunne <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19.17. out of doubt ſome great man in power and place; for as much as the writing of bare Divines, cannot ſo effectually draw people and nations to joyne in warre againſt the Pope. What that the darkning of the Sunne <hi>Apoc.</hi> 6.12. is the fall of the perſecuting Roman Empire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the third part of the Sunne ſmitten, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 8.12. is the waſting of <hi>Africk,</hi> the third part of the world by the <hi>Vandalls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, in this fourth Viall the Sunne himſelf is firſt plagued, which cannot be meant of the Scripture; for the Text doth ſay as directly, that the fourth Angel doth pour his Viall upon the Sunne, as that the fifth doth pour his Viall upon the Throne of the Beaſt; by which <hi>Romes</hi> ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine is fore ſhewed, howbeit the Sunne not extinguiſhed by this Vial, but diſtempered onely, to ſcorch with heat, doth ſeem to imply, that the plague of this Prince or State, ſhall not caſt them down ſo much, as irritate and ſtirre them up to an heat of revenging, laying waſt the men that did hurt them.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the men here plagued are not onely Papiſts, for whereas it is added in the firſt Vial, by way of reſtraint
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:58666:4"/>
to them, that the ſore fell upon the men which had the marke of the Beaſt, and who worſhipped his Image, here is no ſuch limitation, it is onely ſaid in generall, power was given to the Sunne to Torment men, to wit, men of the ſame heaven, where this Sunne ſhineth, that is, men, in that viſible Church where this Prince or State doth govern, nevertheleſſe here is hope given, that the Godly of this Church ſhall eſcape, in that it being ſaid of the plagued, that they gave no glory to God; there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that the Judgement of this Viall ſhall light onely or chiefly on Papiſts and wicked men, mingled with this State or Church, who had before no care of Gods glory, or the Goſpels good, but ſought onely their own glory, wealth and pleaſures.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, the plague here is not onely deſcribed by heat,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> which yet ſufficeth to hold alluſion to the Sunne, but alſo by fire This maketh me to conjecture that this Prince or State ſhall lay deſolate by fire and burning, more then by ſword; God girding him or them with ſuch power, as that they ſhall not need to fight many battels. Neither ought it to ſeem ſtrange, that fire here laying all things waſt, ſhould be literally meant, ſeeing the Angel that hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over fire, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 14.18. is <hi>Cranmer</hi> triumphing in the fire of Martyrdome. And the burning of the fleſh of the Whore, is the ſacking of <hi>Rome, Apoc.</hi> 17.16. ſo the Angel of the waters, in the fifth verſe going before, reſembleth the States of Low <hi>Germany,</hi> ſeated in a watery Countrey.</p>
            <p>The effect of this plague in the wicked, is boyling heat,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and blaſpheming the name of God; which contain more then an inward rage of Papiſts: For the confounding of their religion by the Scripture, they muſt needs ſhew well near ſuch a ruine of a State, as the ruine of <hi>Rome</hi> cometh to, for as much as, as a great plague is deſcribed here, as in the fifth Vial, and that in the ſame termes and words, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58666:5"/>
by comparing this ninth verſe with the eleaventh following. Adde to this, that the plague of this Vial is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the plurall (they blaſphemed the name of God, who hath power over theſe plagues) as if it contained ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny confuſions in it. And this anſwereth to the juſtice of God, who beginneth judgement at his own houſe, and at them who make profeſſion to be of his houſhold: By this Revelation, the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed before the <hi>Turke,</hi> becauſe he profeſſed Chriſtianity, which the <hi>Turke</hi> did not. In like manner before God deſtroyeth the <hi>Pope,</hi> he ſhall pour his Viall upon ſome <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church, which made profeſſion of the Goſpel againſt <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> but obeyed it not; by this means it ſhall come to paſſe what was done of old, then God afflicted <hi>Jewrie</hi> his own Church, before he deſtroyed the Earth by <hi>Babylon</hi>; now he ſhall puniſh one of his own Churches, before he proceeds againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Babylon</hi> ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, I conjecture, that this Sunne of the fourth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Vial puniſhing a Rebellious Church, and the Angel of the fifth Vial ſacking <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall be one and the ſame. Firſt, becauſe the fifth Vial is immediately adjoyned &amp; expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the very ſame termes, which probably induceth to think, that it ſhall be wrought by the ſame means: this conjecture is helped by this; that the rebelling againſt the Sunne of the fourth vial, ſhall be procured by <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which ſhall be the cauſe that this man aſſoon as he hath ſubdued his domeſticall enemies, ſhall addreſſe himſelf to an expedition againſt <hi>Rome.</hi> Secondly, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of <hi>Rome</hi> ariſeth from a wilderneſſe, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.3. that is (as I conjecture) out of ſome Countrey laid waſt like a wilderneſſe.</p>
            <p>This Countrey muſt be the State waſted by the Sunne of the fourth Vial, for we have no other Propheſie of any other State to be laid waſt immediately before <hi>Romes</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:58666:5"/>
ſacking; but only of that: Now that <hi>Johns</hi> carrying into the wilderneſſe to ſee the ruine of <hi>Rome,</hi> doth ſhew that <hi>Romes</hi> ruine ſhall ariſe out of a Land brought to a wilderneſſe, may thus appear; wherefore is <hi>John</hi> ſet on the ſea ſhoar, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.18. when he is to ſee the riſing of the Beaſt, but becauſe the Beaſts riſing is out of the ſea, (<hi>Ergo</hi>) in that <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.3. <hi>John</hi> is placed in a wilderneſſe to ſee <hi>Romes</hi> ruine; it is a ſigne that <hi>Romes</hi> ruine ſhall ariſe out of ſome Countrey reduced to a wilderneſſe; ſo when <hi>John</hi> is to ſee the beauty of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, he is carried to a great high mountain to ſee it, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21.10 to wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Church ſhall be ſet on high like a mountain, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 2.2.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this is the deſcription of him that ſacketh <hi>Rome,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Apoc.</hi> 18.1. I ſaw another Angel come down from heaven, having great power; ſo that the earth was lightned with his glory, which agreeth with the Sunne of this fourth Vial; He cometh down from heaven, that is, ſuddenly, beyond all expectation of man, ſo the Sunne of the fourth Vial ariſeth ſuddenly out of his plague, when the world thought he could never have recovered, he hath great power given him; this is the power of the Sunne of the fourth Vial, both by glory of Conquering, and by the wealth of the Conquered, which he ſhall get into his hands.</p>
            <p>He hath light and brightneſſe, which what, is it elſe but the light and brightneſſe of the Sunne of the fourth Vial. Laſtly, he repleniſheth the earth with his glory, which implyeth the great Admiration of the world, and the Aſtoniſhment of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and earthly men, when they ſhall ſee the Sunne of the fourth Vial riſe ſo extra ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily out of this plague.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſt of all, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.18. it is ſaid, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the ten Hornes ſhall ſack <hi>Rome,</hi> and whom ſhall the

States of Chriſtendome ſooner chooſe for their Generall, or proclaim their Emperour againſt <hi>Rome,</hi> then the Sunne of the fourth Vial, plagued by <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and enraged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and furniſhed with the greateſt authority, power, and wealth to ſubdue them.</p>
            <p>Thus I preſume to deliver my conjecture concerning this fourth Vial. (I ſay conjecture) becauſe it cannot certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be known untill it be executed. Nevertheleſſe, becauſe the time therof approacheth, it becommeth every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an man to ſtrive, by prayer, meditation, ſtudy, and all other means, for ſome underſtanding of it, conſidering that God hath not written this propheſie onely to inſtruct us when it is paſt, but alſo to forewarne us aforehand; The revealer of ſecrets that unſealed this Book to John, open unto us this myſterie of it, that we may foreſee the evill that is to come, and hide our ſelves from it, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo keep our ſelves pure from offence againſt our Sunne, leſt we partake of the plagues that this Vial doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce againſt all ſuch tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <closer>
               <hi>To God onely wiſe, be all Honour and Glory for ever and ever,</hi> Amen.</closer>

            <head>Some Annotations upon Mr. PARKERS diſcourſe.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Eeing Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> hath propoſed his opinion mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly, by way of conjecture, and forborn to determine till the event ſhould manifeſt the truth, he is the rather to be hearkened unto; eſpecially becauſe the reaſons for his conjecture do ſeem very probable, now after the great troubles, which have happened of late years, in <hi>Germany, France, Poland, Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and many other Countryes, and alſo among our ſelves, wherein the greateſt loſſe hath fallen upon the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Churches.</p>
            <p>Whereas Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [that he doth behold Mr.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
               <hi>Brightman</hi> as the chief Angel of this Vial.] He perhaps took this, from Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> himſelf, who Chap. 17. doth not ſpare to ſay. <hi>I that am an obſcure man,</hi> and <hi>unknown to all, and of no reckoning in my own Countrey, do exhort you moſt mighty Princes to attempt againſt the whore,</hi> &amp;c. Which ſeems more then fitting for one <hi>to ſpeak of himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas moſt of our writers do affirm, that all the Uials of Gods wrath ſhall fall upon the <hi>Papiſt.</hi> Yet Mr.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
               <hi>Parker</hi> ſaith, that the firſt Uial ſeems eſpecially to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> in regard it is ſaid, in the text, verſe 2. <hi>that a grievous ſore fell upon the men, which had the mark of the Beaſt, and upon them which worſhipped his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58666:7"/>
image</hi>; but no ſuch reſtraint is mentioned upon this Vial.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=".3"/> Whereas Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> ſaith, Sect. 6. That God beginneth judgement at his own houſe, and at them who make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to be of his houſhold: by this revelation, the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed before the <hi>Turk,</hi> becauſe he profeſſed Chriſtianity, wh<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> the <hi>Turk</hi> did not; in like manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God deſtroyeth the <hi>Pope,</hi> he ſhall pour out his Uial upon ſome <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Lutheran</hi> Church, which made profeſſion of the Goſpel againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> but obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it not.</p>
            <p>This may be ſeen to be true by the lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and great troubles, which have fallen upon the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Churches of late years: For in <hi>Germany,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the horrible Plundering of their rich and ſpacious Countrey, the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have loſt many thouſand Churches and Miniſters. In <hi>France</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have ſuffered extreamly; for though they are left alive, and not proſecuted to death univerſally, yet <hi>Deodatus</hi> ſaith, in his Epiſtle from <hi>Geneva,</hi> that they are aliue but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring pleaſure onely, and that they are like poor Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Birds ſtripe of all their feathers: for whereas they had formerly eighty nine ſtrong Townes and Caſtles allowed them for their ſecurity, yet now they are all loſt, through their warres, whereunto they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, through the fiery zeal of ſome amongſt them, who had the guiding of their Conſciences; ſaith the <hi>French</hi> Hiſtory. [<hi>Grimſton.</hi>] Their great Noble-men have deſerted their cauſe, and become <hi>Papiſts</hi>: as the Duke of <hi>Bovillon</hi> the Duke <hi>Lesbigners,</hi> who when a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> took up arms againſt them, and was made great Conſtable of <hi>France</hi>; the Duke of <hi>Trenovill,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Suilly,</hi> once Lord Treaſurer under <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, who much diſſwaded from warre: beſides many
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58666:7"/>
others of great quality, ſo that now they want Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, and leaders, of the Nobility, which they had in former times.</p>
            <p>The fifth Vial is to be poured out upon the ſeat of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the Beaſt, verſe 10. which as Maſter <hi>Mede</hi> ſaith, is <hi>Rome,</hi> and that the holy Ghoſt doth not hide the matter any longer; but this is yet to come; for the <hi>Pope</hi> after all the troubles, hath greatly encreaſed his party, and is very powerfull, and this year 1650. he celebrates a Jubile at <hi>Rome,</hi> and all his adherents do flock in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to him, to receive his benediction, pardons and holy water, &amp;c. Maſter <hi>Brightman</hi> ſaith, that before this yeear 1650. the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhould be called; and that the whore of <hi>Babylons</hi> noſe ſhould be ſlitt; and that the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould fly from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Avignion,</hi> or to <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia,</hi> or to ſome other of his Cities: But we ſee not the <hi>Pope</hi> diſturbed, nor the <hi>Jewes</hi> called. But ſome are ſo haſty and raſh in their opinions and predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they ſeem to be guided more by paſſion, then reaſon. <hi>Napier</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> kills the <hi>Pope,</hi> 1639. <hi>Brightman</hi> kills him, 1650. <hi>Arthur Dent</hi> kils him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the age of a man, and thinks that the ſixth Vial is now pouring out. <hi>Philippus Nicolaus</hi> kils him about the year, 1650. which is twenty years hence. But theſe peremptory opinions prove falſe hitherto, and do give no ſatisfaction to wiſe and ſober men. It is more probable that Maſter <hi>Mede</hi> ſaith, that the fifth Viall ſhall fall on the <hi>Pope</hi>; and that under the ſixth Viall the <hi>Turkes</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, whom he accounts to be the Kings of the Eaſt, verſe 12. for whom the way muſt be prepared, when that Viall ſhall be poured out on the great River <hi>Euphrates.</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Whereas Maſter <hi>Brightman</hi> ſaith, that the Beaſt the <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> did ſpring up with <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the firſt Chriſtian Emperor; and was made great by the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell.] This is much to the diſhonour of the truth, for <hi>Popery</hi> is of a farre later date and growth. And Maſter <hi>Brightman</hi> doth confeſſe, Chap. 13. that his opinion is new, and himſelf the firſt man that durſt adventure to ſay ſo: If he had ſaid from the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, wherein Images were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, he had come neerer the truth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philippus Nicolaus</hi> a <hi>Lutheran</hi> Divine, (an acute and learned man, ſaith Maſter <hi>Mede</hi>) that wrote above thirty years ago, doth lay great imputations upon the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> ſaying, Cap. 10. <hi>De Regno Chriſti; Eccleſia militantis Noviſsima calamitas a Calvinianis promanabit</hi>: That the laſt calamity of the Church Militant ſhall be occaſioned by the <hi>Calviniſts</hi>; and much more he addeth againſt them, as well as againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Turkes, Brightman, Nicolaus</hi> and <hi>Parker</hi> do all agree in this, that there ſhall come great Calamities upon the Church. <hi>Hoc tantum addo, quod inevitabilis quaedam malorum menſura nostris cervicibus incumbit,</hi> as <hi>Nicolaus</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Maſter <hi>Parker</hi> ſaith, that the Sunne upon whom this fourth Viall falleth, ſhall be diſtempered with heat; not extinguiſhed.] God grant that the Sun of the Goſpel be not totally eclipſed, nor our Candleſtick remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from us; but that theſe troubles prove no more then a diſtemper; mean while to prevent the worſt, the Text ſaith plainly, verſe 9. that onely Repentance can do it, and to give God the glory, who hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over theſe plagues: Which that he would moderate and ſtoppe, and put an end to theſe great troubles, is earneſtly to be begged by humble and fervent prayers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:58666:8"/>But whatſoever the Interpretation be of theſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and myſticall points in the Revelation; it is not ſafe for any men, to ground any action upon preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption or confidence that now the time is come when things ſhall be fulfilled, and that it doth belong to them to execute the Wrath of God againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> or any others, whom they imagine to be deſigned by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
