            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Madam,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Zeal I find run through the whole Nation to expreſs its high value for your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Highneſs, has begot in me an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to promote ſo Noble a Deſign; and ſince the appearance of ſo mean a perſon at Court could add nothing to its Luſtre, I have ſet my thoughts at work how to contribute ſomewhat towards it in my retirement.</p>
            <p>At Your first coming among us, our Loyalty to our Soveraign, and our Duty to his only Brother, diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:93968:3"/>
us to do every thing in our power that might be acceptable to ſo great a Princeſs: But Your Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's condeſcending to the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city in which we live, Your affable deportment towards all that have the honour to come near Your Perſon, and Your ſeeming pleaſed with our weak endeavours to ſerve You, do juſtly challenge that reſpect as due now to Your ſelf, which we must however have paid to Your Quality.</p>
            <p>When we reflected how long we had been ſtrangers to a Court, we could not but think our ſelves ill fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to receive a Princeſs Born and Bred in the Paradiſe of the World; One whom the Greatest Courts of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> had admired, and who had been uſed to nothing below the best of our <hi>Britiſh</hi> Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: only as we then knew Your Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Highneſs came prepared to bear
<pb facs="tcp:93968:3"/>
with the plainneſs of a Northern Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; ſo we ſince find you are in ſome meaſure delighted with it: and we begin to flatter our ſelves, that the happineſs of ſo illuſtrious a Gueſt, which was procured to us at first by Your Obedience, is now continued to us by your choice.</p>
            <p>Theſe things having already gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Your Royal Highneſs the hearts of all this Kingdom, I thought I could not employ my ſelf better than in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to confirm our Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Your perſon, by an account of Your Family; and as we eaſily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined it to be no Ordinary One, ſo upon an exact ſearch, I find that <hi>Italy</hi> has nothing more Ancient or Great to boast of.</p>
            <p>Your Heroick Anceſtors have been ſhares in all the Memorable Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of <hi>Italy</hi> theſe twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years and upward: They have
<pb facs="tcp:93968:4"/>
oftner than once reſcued it from the Barbarous Nations; their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for great Generals has ſet them ſince on the Head of moſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Armies of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and no Blood has been more prodigally ſacrificed in their National Quarrels, than that of <hi>Eſté.</hi> Nor has <hi>Italy</hi> alone been the Theatre of their Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Actions, or the Seat of their Greatneſs; <hi>Germany</hi> is able to bear teſtimony of both. The Ancient Dukes of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> ſo famous in Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, were Princes of <hi>Eſté;</hi> and their Off-ſpring, the preſent Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh,</hi> who in Birth yield to no <hi>German,</hi> and who have had the Imperial Crown in their Family, yet ſeem to glory, <hi>Madam,</hi> in their being deſcended of Yours. To all this we must add the great Alliances by which the Princes of Your most Serene Family
<pb facs="tcp:93968:4"/>
have wiſely kept up their Grandeur, as appears by their matching into the Houſes of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and of <hi>Arragon,</hi> and to most of the Royal Families of <hi>Europe;</hi> ſo that I may with much aſſurance ſay, That there is no Nobler Blood in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom</hi> than what runs in Your Royal Highneſs's Veins, and that the Greatneſs of Your Birth is not infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to that of Your Condition, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſutable that a Princeſs of a Family next in Dignity to thoſe of Crown'd heads, ſhould be ſet next a Throne.</p>
            <p>So great an Argument deſerved, I confeſs, to have been managed by a better Pen; yet how much ſoever it may ſuffer in my hands, I am infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely beholden to the negligence of others, that reſerved to me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of paying You this Tribute, which I offer with all humility to Your Royal
<pb facs="tcp:93968:5"/>
Highneſs. If you vouchſafe it Your Gracious Acceptance, my Pains are exceſſively rewarded, and I ſhall hereafter glory in what I dare not yet own without raſhneſs; for ſeeing the work is more likely to loſe than gain reputation by ſo obſcure an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, I have not the confidence to make my ſelf publick by any other Name, than that of being,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS the Invention of Printing proved very Inſtrumental to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the reſcue of the world from the Ignorance which over-run it in former Ages; ſo the great exceſſes of the Preſs at preſent are like to give a deadly blow to all manner of Learning. When the hard purchaſe of good Manuſcripts had made, that Knowledge was long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed into a few, and thoſe but ill hands; no wonder, if upon the Preſſes enlightning <hi>Europe,</hi> its productions were received with greedineſs: News from the Fairs of <hi>Francfort</hi> were then as curiouſly enquired after, as we in this Politick and buſie Age do after intrigues of State. Ancient Authors purged from the rubbiſh of illiterate Copiſts were publiſhed with great care; every year likewiſe brought
<pb facs="tcp:93968:6"/>
forth ſome new Piece of ſolid Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and our Fathers in little more than one Century retrieved what their Anceſtors had loſt in many.</p>
            <p>But men grew ſoon weary of ſo much application, and reſolved ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to attain unto Knowledge upon eaſier terms or not at all; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>French,</hi> who pretend to give Laws to the world in every thing, have ſet up a modiſh ſort of compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Learning, which requires no great ſtudy, as it gives no deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and thus have loaded us with a vaſt number of empty Books: and though it muſt be allowed they have given us ſome incomparable pieces of late upon ſeveral Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet theſe bearing no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in number to the others which are more commonly put into ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers hands, they have the ill luck to paſs generally for ſuperficial Authors. In our Neighbour Nation the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are ſo in vogue, and ſo much money and time is conſumed in them, that any thing of more valuable Learning is too much laid aſide: their Term Catalogues are ſtuffed
<pb facs="tcp:93968:6"/>
with idle Pamphlets; it is thought but a barren week that brings not more than one Treatiſe to light; nay, I am informed they are now come to that pitch, that the Curious muſt be with their Bookſeller once a day to ſee what new things are come out that morning: and moſt of theſe like Muſhroms, as they are hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one day or week at moſt, ſo they ſeldom ſurvive another, and then like things antiquated and out of date, they are juſtly condemned for waſte paper. So that by the conſtant recruits of theſe ill digeſted pieces, which are ſet off with all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of ſpecious Titles, men ſcarce know what to read; and many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn in by ſuch charms, and finding afterwards by their ill choice much of their time miſ-imploy'd, are too apt to conceive a prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Books. In ſhort, Printing being now a Trade upon which a great many others depend; and the Stationers who manage it, looking no further than their preſent advantage, there is juſt ground given us to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that this ungovern'd Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
<pb facs="tcp:93968:7"/>
of the Preſs may bring the next Age under as great an averſion for Books, as the former had curioſity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them.</p>
            <p>The world being thus overſtock'd in Authors, and moſt men thinking themſelves imperfect in their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion till they make a ſhift to be in print, it may ſeem ſtrange that here among us We contribute ſo little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this general abuſe, and are ſo far from this vanity, that like people bred long in the Countrey we have not confidence to appear in the croud, even when we are invited to it; but ſuffer the Preſs to lye idle, as if we were reſolved by our obſtinate ſilence to let the world grow unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with us, and after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to loſe the reputation we once had for Learning and vivacity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</p>
            <p>When Learning was reſtored, and men began to have a more refined taſt of Books, our Nation produced ſome who did advance as early to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ancient Purity of Writing as any other, the <hi>Italians</hi> only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. <hi>Hector Boethius</hi> if he had
<pb facs="tcp:93968:7"/>
not been obſcured by greater Lights that came after him, had paſt for no ordinary man: It is true, his too much affecting to imitate <hi>Livy,</hi> put him often upon making long dull ſpeeches in Councils and Armies; and the humour of that age being no leſs for believing and reporting extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant things than the Heathens were, he almoſt out-does <hi>Livy</hi> in relating unuſual, if not incredible events: yet with all that alloy it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that he writ as well as any of his Contemporaries. Next to <hi>Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thius</hi> comes <hi>Leſly,</hi> whoſe temper and way of writing are excellent, only his ſtyle, though in the main ſtrokes it be good, yet in many places wants finiſhing, and is not altogether free from errours. <hi>Buchanan</hi> excelled not only all that went before him in his own Countrey, but had ſcarce his Equal in that Learned Age wherein he lived; he ſpent the firſt flame and rage of his fancy in Poetry, in which whether he did imitate <hi>Virgil</hi> in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicks, <hi>Ovid</hi> in Elegiacks, <hi>Lucretius</hi> in writing Philoſophy, <hi>Seneca</hi> in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedies, <hi>Martial</hi> in Epigrams, or <hi>Harace</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93968:8"/>
and <hi>Juvenal</hi> in Satyrs, he copied after thoſe great Maſters ſo perfectly, that nothing ever approached nearer the Original; and his Immortal Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe on the Pſalms doth ſhew, that neither the conſtraint of a limited matter, the darkneſs of expreſſion, nor the frequent returns of the ſame or the like phraſes could confine or exhauſt that vaſt Genius. At laſt, in his old age, when his thoughts were purified by long reflection and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a true judgment came in the room of one of the richeſt Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that ever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was, he wrote our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory with ſuch beauty of ſtyle, eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of expreſſion, and exactneſs in all its parts, that no Service nor Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour could have been done the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion like it, had he ended ſo Noble a Work as he began and carried it on till King <hi>James</hi> the fifth's death: but being unhappily engaged in a Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and reſentments working violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him, he ſuffered himſelf to be ſo ſtrangely byaſſed, that in the relations he gives of many of the tranſactions of his own time, he may rather paſs for a Satyriſt than an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian:
<pb facs="tcp:93968:8"/>
Notwithſtanding this great blemiſh, few durſt venture to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſo elaborate a Work, or write of our Affairs after him; yet this muſt be ſaid of <hi>Johnſton,</hi> that nothing makes him ſo little conſidered as his coming after <hi>Buchanan. Dempſter</hi> was like to have eſcaped me, who of all others ſhews the greateſt zeal and induſtry in recovering every frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Antiquity, which may either help to illuſtrate the darker Ages of our Church, or raiſe the Glory of our Nation; but a ſtrain of bigottry that runs through every Line of him, doth much weaken his Authority amongſt us. In our own Language <hi>Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> if his inclinations to Poetry had not carried him too far in a flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid way of writing, had been more deſervedly valued: But Arch-biſhop <hi>Spot ſwood</hi> by affecting the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, and uſing an inimitable plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſtyle, has ſomething in him that is great, and takes highly with all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning people.</p>
            <p>I only mention thoſe who have done themſelves and their Countrey credit bywriting of our own Affairs;
<pb facs="tcp:93968:9"/>
for if with the two <hi>Barclays,</hi> whom <hi>France</hi> doth envy us, and the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful <hi>Creighton</hi> whom <hi>Italy</hi> cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and admired as a ſecond <hi>Picus,</hi> I ſhould bring in thoſe of our Nation that have been eminently Learned in their ſeveral Profeſſions, they would make a pompous ſhew: But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I can take no pleaſure in number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up our Glorious Anceſtors, or in boaſting of our paſt merits, being tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible how unhappy we have been of late. We meet with none of our refined Wits in the Courts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, nor of our Eminent Profeſſors in their Univerſities to welcom us in our travels, as formerly; and the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men we have at home will only be known for ſuch to their friends in confidence, as if there were danger in their being diſcovered. And while the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> by a fondneſs natural to moſt People, admire too much their own Writers; we ſeem to be without the reach of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation: for except one Noble Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, whom his own Elegant Pen doth commend much beyond any thing I am able to ſay, and one Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb facs="tcp:93968:9"/>
Divine, who having gratefully ſacrificed the firſt-fruits of his labours to his own Countrey, has ſince deſerved of our Neighbours to be advanced amongſt their choiceſt Hiſtorians; We have not, that I know of, any elſe whom we can with any reaſon admire. It may therefore be no improper part of a <hi>Preface,</hi> to conſider what ſhould bring us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch a ſcarcity of Writers, when all other Nations ſeem to be cloyed with too great abundance.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be thought an ill Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt for my Countrey, and a worſe Arguer, to inſiſt much upon the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Climate, or the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſoil, which have been the ſame in our moſt flouriſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But there are two things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in our preſent Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which I ſhall preſume to offer, as the true reaſons of the decreaſe of Learned Writers amongſt us: The one is, that Divines, who have in all Ages been the chief Preſervers and Improvers of Knowledge, are here ſo unhappily diſtracted by the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions now on foot, that they have
<pb facs="tcp:93968:10"/>
no heart to undertake or advance any conſiderable deſign in Learning. When controverſies ariſe that give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to great and ſolid debates, theſe quicken the induſtry of the contending Parties to diſcover ſuch things as may be for the advantage of their cauſe: but as our differences are ſuch as can never admit of a Learned Confutation, ſo there is no encouragement for any man to go about it who knows our preſent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For it is plain, that an obſtinate reſolution to continue the breach, ſcorns to yield to the ſtrongeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of reaſon; yet this unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Schiſm has raiſed ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heats, and brought our Clergy under ſuch contempt, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably expect great things from them; and which is indeed more deplorable, men of better Genius's, ſeeing the difficulties with which they ſtruggle, do follow other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments: ſo that if our condition be bad on this account in the preſent Age, it is like to be worſe in the next. Beſides, though great care has been taken in the Conſtitution of our
<pb facs="tcp:93968:10"/>
Church to preſerve the inferiour Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy from poverty; yet there are not thoſe advantages of Books and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy for encouraging extraordinary perſons in their ſtudies, with which other Nations abound.</p>
            <p>But that which beyond all other things has ſet us ſo far back in learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is our having no more the great incitements, which a Courts reſiding among us would afford: We do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed rejoyce with our King that his Empire is ſo conſiderably enlarged by the acceſſion of a double Crown; we acknowledge alſo with all gratefull Duty, that our Princes indulgent tenderneſs for their Ancient and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Kingdom ever ſince their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, has made them carefull to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to us our former happineſs in every thing ſave in their Royal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. They have left their Revenue to circulate among us for the ſupport of the Government, they have never given us up to the uneaſie domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Strangers, under which we ſufficiently ſmarted in the ſhort time of our Union with <hi>France;</hi> we have been admitted to a ſhare in the beſt
<pb facs="tcp:93968:11"/>
Offices of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and made no ſmall part of our Princes Court; and if of late for want of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our attendance there, we are not ſo frequently advanced to high Stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet we are ſenſible that all the truſts, honours and advantages of our own Countrey remain entire in our hands, ſo that no additional King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, no not <hi>Arragon</hi> it ſelf, with all its high priviledges, has leſs reaſon to complain.</p>
            <p>But after all this and much more that might be added of the Juſtice and Goodneſs of our three laſt Kings, which well deſerve the enlargements of a Nobler Pen, we are ſtill unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, becauſe deprived by our Princes abſence of all the advantages that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew to Learning from the nearneſs of a Court: We have no foreign Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters among us, nor ſend we any beyond Sea, by which we might keep correſpondence with the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; ſtrangers now have no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to come within our borders and we ſeem to be in all reſpects cut off from the Society of Mankind: We complain not of Nature for caſting
<pb facs="tcp:93968:11"/>
us into a corner of the world, into a lean ſoil, and a Climate remote from the Sun; it is our Kings diſtance from us we more heartily lament than the Suns: His Anceſtors benign influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence made us eaſie under all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies Nature expoſed us to, and his perſon is a happineſs which we envy our Neighbours much more than their ſouthern ſituation. The chief reaſon then why we languiſh in Virtue, and the Muſes grow bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren among us, is, becauſe of late we neither feel the dew, nor the warmth of Royal Patronage; for certainly nothing can give ſo effectual a check to great and aſpiring minds, or keep them from that generous Conteſt, who ſhall deſerve beſt of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by any Learned underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as to ſee themſelves almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reach both of the Princes eye and of his hand.</p>
            <p>Of all this the following Hiſtory gives us a ſignal inſtance. While <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> was happy in its Dukes and their Court, it was one of the Nobleſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Italy,</hi> Learning had ſuch encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement there, that not only the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb facs="tcp:93968:12"/>
ſaw their Intereſt in ſtudying, but ſtrangers from all places were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the bounty of thoſe Princes. When <hi>Rome</hi> did moſt ſhamefully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the <hi>Greek</hi> Profeſſors, <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Florence</hi> cheriſhed them, and to the glorious protection of the moſt Serene Houſe of <hi>Eſté,</hi> and that of <hi>Medici, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> chiefly owed its encreaſe of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: But ſince by the Popes unjuſt uſurpation <hi>Ferrara</hi> is turn'd an acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary principality to that which is called S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patrimony, the world hears no more news from thence; that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity which was formerly ſo Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous is ſeldom now mentioned, and the ſpirits of the Inhabitants are ſunk with their City almoſt into rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh.</p>
            <p>Having thus pointed at what a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Writer could more fully deſcribe concerning the true cauſes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of Learning amongſt us, I now come to give an account of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Deſign of my preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. I obſerved that the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> had taken care to furniſh us by way of Tranſlation with the general Hiſtories of Countries, but leſſer
<pb facs="tcp:93968:12"/>
Principalities lay ſtill neglected, tho' in ſuch we often meet with curious and great tranſactions that are not commonly known. After I had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reſolved to make ſome attempt of this kind, my acquaintance with <hi>Italian</hi> Authors enclined me moſt to <hi>Italy,</hi> which has always been the Theatre of the moſt memorable Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and there the Princes of <hi>Eſte</hi> preſented themſelves as beſt deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my pains, in regard of the great influence they have had upon the Affairs of that Countrey for many Ages: but that which fully determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my choice was a hearty deſire of making ſome ſmall acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Honour which her Royal Highneſs the Dutcheſs of <hi>Albany</hi> now does our Nation; and I had reaſon to believe that nothing could be more gratefull to my Countrey-men, or more ſutable to the Veneration they have for her Highneſs, than an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Illuſtrious Race of Princes, of whom ſhe is deſcended. I have affected the ſimplicity of an Hiſtorical ſtyle, which next to fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and exactneſs, I look on as the
<pb facs="tcp:93968:13"/>
chief Ornament of ſuch a Work. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter peruſing carefully all the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of the Family, I chiefly conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Sigonius, Jovius</hi> and <hi>Guicciardin,</hi> and found ſome trouble in digeſting my matter into ſo ſhort a compaſs. If I am approved of by judicious or diſcerning perſons, ſo that this Eſſay is favourably received, it will encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage me to go on with the ſecond part, where together with what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately relates to the Dukes of <hi>Modena,</hi> I ſhall take occaſion to treat more largely than hitherto I have done, of what has paſt of late in thoſe parts; but if I have the luck to be little read, or much cenſured, as this is my firſt Eſſay, ſo it is like to be my laſt.</p>

            <p>His Son <hi>Acarinus</hi> equally concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to defend his Countrey, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge <hi>Foreſtus</hi>'s death, brought ſuch supplies to the beſieged as help'd to delay the Fate of the City; but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and the Beſiegers obſtinacy cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off at length all hopes of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, after a long and vigorous reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they retired by night to <hi>Grado,</hi> where they were ſcarce well arrived, when the flames began to appear that in a few hours buried <hi>Aquileia</hi> in its Aſhes, as a laſting Monument of <hi>Atila</hi>'s cruelty.</p>
            <p>The next place of importance after <hi>Aquileia</hi> was <hi>Altinum,</hi> built upon the Brink of the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> which <hi>Atila</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93968:17"/>
preſently gave order to block up: yet his great expedition could not keep <hi>Acarinus</hi> from ſupplying it with men and proviſion, nor from going thither in perſon to ſee that nothing were wanting for its defence: but finding all endeavours prove ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, he got together what Boats and Shallops the neighbouring Villages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded and conveyed the Inhabitants ſafe to the Iſlands of <hi>Boran, Mazorbo</hi> and <hi>Torcello,</hi> leaving the bare Walls to the mercy of the Conquerour who treated <hi>Altinum</hi> as he had done <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe of <hi>Treviſo, Padoua,</hi> and <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza,</hi> not willing to truſt <hi>Atila</hi>'s cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, nor yet in a condition to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him, were adviſed by <hi>Acarinus</hi> to ſhelter themſelves at <hi>Malamoco</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other little Iſlands near enough to be furniſhed with neceſſaries from the Land, and yet ſecure from the <hi>Huns</hi> attacks; and he himſelf percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving how ſucceſsful he had been in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing his Neighbours, thought it high time to provide for the ſafety of thoſe who were more immediately under his care and protection, returning
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93968:17"/>
therefore to <hi>Esté</hi> before the <hi>Huns</hi> could reach it, he conducted his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>Paleſtrina,</hi> and <hi>Chiozza,</hi> near the mouth of the <hi>Po.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every place afterwards yielding to <hi>Atila</hi>'s victorious Army, the Country was ſoon over-run; and he loaded with the ſpoils of ſo many Cities, thought fit to go home, and disbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then himſelf, reſolving to return the next year; but a ſudden Death oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, as ſome ſay, by poiſon; or as others, by drunkenneſs; put a ſtop to this torrent, freed <hi>Italy</hi> from the apprehenſion ofa ſecond invaſion, and the World from ſuch a ſcourge of Gods wrath as former Ages had not felt.</p>
            <p>This drew <hi>Acarinus</hi> back to <hi>Esté</hi> with thoughts to repair the Walls, had not freſh troubles diverted him. The Empreſs, full of reſentment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Maximus</hi> for procuring the death of her Husband <hi>Valentinian</hi> the III. called in <hi>Genſerick</hi> King of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> who waited only for ſuch an invitation. Whereever the <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals</hi> came they left greater marks of their cruelty than ever the <hi>Huns</hi> had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93968:18"/>
done; the only comfort was, they made no long ſtay, but went back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Africk,</hi> and in requital of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes kindneſs carried her and her two Daughters with them as Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phees of their Victory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Italy</hi> had not time to breathe after ſuch a terrible blow when the <hi>Alains</hi> who had hitherto contained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> croſs'd the <hi>Alpes</hi> to ſeize upon what the <hi>Vandals</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>461</label> had left; the people therefore whom <hi>Acarinus</hi> had made retire unto the Iſlands of the <hi>Adriatick,</hi> finding things every day grow worſe, choſe rather to ſtruggle with the inconveniences of thoſe barren habitations than to be expoſed to freſh dangers; and then did the repeated Calamities of <hi>Italy</hi> give the firſt beginnings to the City and Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> which have ſince prov'd its greateſt Ornament, as well as the maintainer of its Liberty: So that in this alone <hi>Italy</hi> muſt own it ſelf ſufficiently rewarded for what it then ſuffered, and all may here trace the admirable methods of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which made uſe of thoſe barbarous Nations to raiſe this bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93968:18"/>
for after Ages againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching greatneſs of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Power, more formidable to <hi>Italy</hi> and to all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> than ever were <hi>Huns, Vandals</hi> or <hi>Alains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Acarinus,</hi> his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was now too well known to be long without employment. <hi>Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> the Emperour having raiſed an Army to chaſe away the <hi>Alains,</hi> made <hi>Richimer</hi> Commander in chief, and <hi>Acarinus</hi> General of the Horſe, the next place in dignity and truſt under him; and in this he did behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo well, that the ſucceſs of that great battel near <hi>Bergamo,</hi> in which the King of the <hi>Alains</hi> was kill'd, his Army irrecoverably loſt, and <hi>Italy</hi> thereby once more freed from ſlavery was chiefly due to <hi>Acarinus</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. Whereupon he was made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of all beyond the River <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,</hi> as the fitteſt perſon to guard the Frontiers againſt the barbarous <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>471</label> Nations which commonly made their inroads that way.</p>
            <p>All the reſt of his life he enjoy'd this great truſt which few had either merit or courage to aſpire to; at laſt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93968:19"/>
               <hi>Odoacer</hi> King of the <hi>Herules</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what a weak paſs the Empire was brought, ventured to tread the footſteps of the <hi>Alains,</hi> and found <hi>Acarinus</hi> ready to oppoſe him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeveral skirmiſhes they came to a general Engagement, not far from <hi>Lode,</hi> where <hi>Acarinus,</hi> over-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by number, and refuſing to yield, ſealed all his generous undertakings for his Country with his life. He being killed, <hi>Odoacer</hi> met with little more reſiſtance; but having taken <hi>Auguſtulus</hi> Priſoner, he became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Italy.</hi> And thus was the Weſtern Empire utterly aboliſhed, which by Foreign Invaſions and Civil Broils had been in a languiſhing condition of a long time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acarinus</hi> had two Wives, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was <hi>Gardena</hi> Queen of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> who accompanying <hi>Atila</hi> in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition was perſwaded to exchange her Crown for the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By her he had <hi>Atius,</hi> ſo named from his Family; and by a ſecond Wife he had <hi>Conſtantius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though <hi>Odoacer</hi>'s Government proved more gentle than was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93968:19"/>
yet <hi>Atius</hi> (or <hi>Azo,</hi> a great name ſince in the Houſe of <hi>Eſte)</hi> and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> not thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſecure, retired into <hi>Germany;</hi> and coming into the Court of <hi>Theodo</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> had a reception from him full of reſpect and kindneſs, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>481</label> which he afterwards confirmed by the Marriage of his Daughter to <hi>Azo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Zeno</hi> was created Emperor of the Eaſt, as he was concerned for his Title to <hi>Italy,</hi> though not able to make it good, ſo being willing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to find employment for a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Prince abroad, whom he look'd upon as a dangerous Neighbour, he declared <hi>Theodorick</hi> King of the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrogoths</hi> his General againſt <hi>Odoacer. Theodorick</hi> clothed in this Expedition with the Emperours Authority found many Friends, and none more zealous than <hi>Azo</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius.</hi> In the three ſeveral Battles where <hi>Odoacer</hi> was overthrown, and at the Siege of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> where he was glad to yield up a part of his Kingdom to ſave the reſt.

            <p>In the life of <hi>Azo</hi> we find little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards remarkable, but his Brothers laſt action, far ſurpaſſed all that he had formerly done. For when <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odatus</hi> impriſoned <hi>Amalaſuntha Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorick's</hi> Daughter, <hi>Conſtantius</hi> mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his obligations to that Family, <label type="milestone">

            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>BAſilius</hi> and <hi>Valerian</hi> ſeeing <hi>Italy</hi> thus reunited to the Empire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo long a Train of miſeries, were expecting to taſte the fruits of peace and of <hi>Narſes</hi>'s bounty, when on a ſudden the <hi>Lombards,</hi> a people not yet known in the Weſtern Parts of the World, threatened them with a <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>568</label> new Storm. Here the Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Hiſtorians do much differ; for theſe in relating the cauſe of the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi>'s invaſion fix it upon <hi>Narſes,</hi> who after having recovered <hi>Italy</hi> to the Emperour, expected to receive a treatment ſuitable to his merit; but <hi>Juſtin</hi> the Second, governed by his Empreſs, as <hi>Juſtinian</hi> had been all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by <hi>Theodora,</hi> ſlighted the ſervice which he could not ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and was ſo ill adviſed as to make known his diſpleaſure againſt <hi>Narſes</hi> before his return: whereupon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93968:21"/>
               <hi>Narſes,</hi> as the Latines write, called in the <hi>Lombards;</hi> but, grieved for what he had done, dyed before their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. The Greeks, who allow great weakneſs and ingratitude in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's carriage in ſuffering a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to be expoſed to the affronts of his Empreſs and her Women, who had deſerved ſo well the honour of a triumph, with every thing elſe that the Emperour could do in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of his extraordinary merit; ſay nothing of his being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy to the <hi>Lombard</hi>'s Deſign: but on the contrary highly extol the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, courage and piety of <hi>Narſes,</hi> which certainly they would never have done, had they known his laſt action to be ſo black.</p>
            <p>Whoever they were that betrayed <hi>Italy</hi> to the <hi>Lombards,</hi> we are ſure <hi>Baſilius</hi> and <hi>Valerian</hi> of <hi>Eſté</hi> had no hand in it, they being the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who had the courage with a few Followers to ſtop <hi>Alboinus</hi> in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. In this they followed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of their glorious Anceſtor <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restus,</hi> but came ſhort of his ſucceſs; for their Forces bearing no proportion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93968:22"/>
to the <hi>Lombards</hi> in number, they were glad to give way to <hi>Alboinus</hi>'s Fortune, and make the beſt terms for themſelves and their Subjects they could. And as the Country which ſubmitted to this Yoke has ever ſince been known by the name of <hi>Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> ſo <hi>Italy</hi> upon the other ſide of the <hi>Apennin</hi> muſt have expected no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Fate, had not the Queen for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to drink out of her Fathers Scull, ſeaſonably revenged this barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous affront by the death of her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Alboinus,</hi> before he could finiſh <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>574</label> his Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clephis,</hi> who ſucceeded him, was likewiſe killed after eighteen Months Reign, and the <hi>Lombards,</hi> not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a new choice, divided their whole Dominion among thirty of their chief Officers with the title of Dukes. <hi>Baſilius</hi> and <hi>Valerian,</hi> glad to ſee them cantoniz'd after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, got together a ſmall Army, with which they fought <hi>Agiſulphus</hi> Duke of <hi>Friuli,</hi> who narrowly eſcaped being made Priſoner upon the defeat of his Army. The neighbouring Dukes, of <hi>Trent, Bergamo</hi> and <hi>Breſcia,</hi> alarmed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93968:22"/>
at this ſucceſs, and jealous of their growth, enter'd into a confederacy <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>585</label> joyntly to oppoſe them in all their motions; this put a preſent ſtop to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilius</hi> and <hi>Valerians</hi> proceedings.</p>
            <p>The Emperour <hi>Juſtin</hi> not able of himſelf to give the <hi>Lombards</hi> great diſturbance, took occaſion from their late incurſions into <hi>France,</hi> to engage that Nation againſt them; but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the <hi>French</hi> in this action, did neither anſwer their forwardneſs nor the opinion the world had of them, for they ſcarce enduring one charge of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> turn'd their backs, and left many of their Chief Officers dead upon the place: among the reſt we find <hi>Valerian</hi> of <hi>Eſté</hi> here loſt his life, fighting for the Liberty of his Countrey, as his Father <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> had done many years before in the War of <hi>Narſes</hi> againſt the <hi>Goths.</hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93968:23"/>
him by <hi>Valerian</hi> judged it now no hard matter to be revenged upon his Son. <hi>Montſelice</hi> which belonged to the Family of <hi>Eſté,</hi> and which of all the places in that part of <hi>Italy,</hi> could only boaſt of never having received a <hi>Lombard</hi> within its walls, was the prize he aim'd at: but young <hi>Aldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardus</hi> Heir to <hi>Valerian</hi>'s courage as well as his fortune, did ſo bravely defend it, that <hi>Agiſulphus</hi> retired with confuſion, leaving the place to the juſt owner.</p>
            <p>This Action which ſufficed to have raiſed <hi>Aldoardus</hi>'s reputation, was in a ſhort time back'd with many other proofs of his valour and conduct; at length <hi>Ariovaldus</hi> King of the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi>

it, becauſe that Emperour fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed the worſhip of Images, which <hi>Gregory</hi> was then introducing, proved more favourable to the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi> deſigns, for by this unjuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence the Emperours Miniſters were caſt out of moſt places, and that ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Authority left him, was quite loſt, and they encouraged to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the ſiege of <hi>Ravenna</hi> the ſecond time: But miſcarrying again in their attempt, they ſet upon <hi>Rimini,</hi> which they had ſcarce well inveſted when a <hi>Venetian</hi> Army under the Conduct of <hi>Erneſtus</hi> gave them battel, and after a hot diſpute forced them to retire with great loſs, leaving their Kings Nephew priſoner to be led by <hi>Erne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>

            <p>The fatal conſequence of the Popes unjuſt dealing with the Emperour, was the ſame that <hi>Erneſtus</hi> had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told; for the <hi>Lombards</hi> being now abſolute Maſters, grew inſupportable
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93968:25"/>

            </argument>
            <p>DUring <hi>Pepin</hi>'s Invaſion we find no mention of <hi>Henry</hi> the Son, or as ſome Writers will have him, the Grand-child of <hi>Erneſtus;</hi> the only War I obſerve from <hi>Atila</hi> down to this time, in which we cannot prove, that any of the Houſe of <hi>Eſté</hi> had part. Seeing the Hiſtorians ſilence leaves us to our conjectures, it ſeems moſt probable that the unhappy death of <hi>Erneſtus,</hi> and the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Power of the <hi>Lombards</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they got <hi>Ravenna,</hi> might keep <hi>Henry</hi> from engaging till he had a certain proſpect of their ruine; and therefore when <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> came, he firſt appeared upon the head of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Troops ſent to aſſiſt the <hi>French</hi> againſt the <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards. Erneſtus</hi> had been formerly their General at <hi>Rimini,</hi> which made
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93968:26"/>
them the more willing now to employ <hi>Henry:</hi> Nor could he decline ſo fair an occaſion of being revenged upon the <hi>Lombards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How well <hi>Henry</hi> behaved himſelf in this War, or how much his own merit, joined to that of his Family, made him regarded, can beſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Charles the Great</hi>'s Bounty to him, after <hi>Deſiderius</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards</hi> was taken Priſoner, and the Army diſmiſs'd: For beſides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>774</label> of what he formerly poſſeſt, he had <hi>Treviſo</hi> given him, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try alſo of <hi>Scodoſia,</hi> with the Title of Count, and his Son <hi>Berengarius</hi> was invited to Court, as the fitteſt place for his education.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was the Emperour gone, but thoſe who retained any kindneſs for the <hi>Lombards</hi> began to hatch new Projects how to reſtore <hi>Adalgiſius</hi> the Son of <hi>Deſiderius</hi> to his Fathers Throne. The great Contriver of this was <hi>Rodigaud</hi> Duke of <hi>Friuli,</hi> who being jealous of their placing <hi>Henry</hi> at <hi>Treviſo</hi> upon the Skirts of his Country, as a Spy upon his actions, concluded that nothing could be done
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93968:27"/>
till he were diſpatched; by the Dukes inſtigation then the factious Party in <hi>Treviſo</hi> pretending the breach of ſome priviledges, ſuddenly took Armes, kill'd <hi>Henry,</hi> impriſoned his Wife and Children, and forc'd thoſe of his Train to leave the Town. Their ſucceſs here gave encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to inſurrections in other places; ſo that it was like to have broken out into an open Rebellion, had not the Emperours return confirmed his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and given him occaſion to enquire into the Authors of ſuch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rodigaud</hi> being found guilty of the Murther of <hi>Henry,</hi> loſt his head, thoſe of <hi>Treviſo</hi> were ſeverely dealt with, <hi>Henry</hi>'s Wife and Children were ſet at liberty; and to ſecure the peace of that Country, <hi>Berengarius, Henry</hi>'s Son, being high now in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours favour, was left in his Fathers place, and did in every thing anſwer the good opinion the Emperour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of his zeal and fitneſs for his ſervice.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Berengarius</hi> lived at the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Court, his winning carriage
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93968:27"/>
made him to be highly regarded by all, and particularly by Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> the Emperours Son, who, ſucceeding <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>814</label> 
               <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> invited <hi>Berengarius</hi> into <hi>France.</hi> At his arrival he found the purple had no way changed the Princes former inclinations; and after ſome ſtay at Court, an occaſion was offered by which he was aſſured of the Emperours confidence in him, and the Emperour likewiſe of his fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity. <hi>Charles the Great</hi> had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his Grand-child <hi>Bernard</hi> King of <hi>Italy,</hi> but he being young and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, ſuffered himſelf to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his Favourites, That the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown did of right belong to him, as the Son of <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This, with the invitations ſent him from the diſaffected Party in <hi>France,</hi> did ſoon engage him in a War againſt his Unkle. Upon the News of <hi>Bernard</hi>'s March towards <hi>France,</hi> the Emperour, who was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of moſt about him, gave the Command of his Army to <hi>Berengari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> Count of <hi>Eſté,</hi> who, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding a Battel, being afraid of the treachery of his under Officers, who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93968:28"/>
either were or eaſily could be corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, did ſo manage the buſineſs that King <hi>Bernard,</hi> diſappointed of the <hi>French</hi> that were to join him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned by moſt of thoſe he brought from <hi>Italy,</hi> was perſwaded by <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius</hi> to come in perſon to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Court, there to owne his raſhneſs, and to humble himſelf to his Unkle; But the barbarous uſage he had, did much leſſen the Glory of <hi>Berengarius</hi>'s action: For the poor Prince, when he expected only a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle rebuke, and leave to return home, was caſt into a loathſom Priſon, after <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>818</label> many indignities had his eyes put out, and died in three days, partly through pain, partly through anguiſh. Indeed his Fate was deplorable, being inconſiderately hurried upon his own ruine, when he had ſcarce compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his Age; and though the Emperour thought this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his ſeverity upon his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew and his Followers, who were all treated after the ſame manner, did ſecure his Crown, yet he found by woful experience that it irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly loſt him the affections of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:93968:28"/>
Upon King <hi>Bernard</hi>'s death the Emperours Son <hi>Lotharius</hi> was ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> and becauſe he was young and not acquainted with the cuſtoms of the Countrey. <hi>Berengarius</hi> by his Fathers Order did accompany him thither, to adviſe him in all affairs of moment. <hi>Berengarius,</hi> proving more uſeful to the Emperour in <hi>Italy</hi> than he could be elſewhere, continued there ſeveral years; and by his credit ordered things as he pleaſed. Some ſparks of jealouſie afterwards appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt the Emperour and his Children, were induſtriouſly blown up into a Civil War by thoſe who could never forgive King <hi>Bernard</hi>'s death. <hi>Berengarius,</hi> ever true to the Emperours intereſt, upon the firſt report of his danger made what haſte he could towards him, yet came too late; for the Emperour was already ſtrip'd of his power, and confin'd to a Monaſtery, where they intended he ſhould have paſt the reſt of his time in expiating by a rigid penance the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>583</label> crimes he ſtood accuſed of.</p>
            <p>If they had dealt more gently with him, it is likely he had never been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93968:29"/>
to weather ſo violent a ſtorm; but however ſtrange it may ſeem, his being brought ſo very low was the occaſion of his ſpeedy re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For that popular fury which at firſt he could not withſtand, was preſently turned to compaſſion, and the Emperour again put in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to call his Sons to an account while they were at variance among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. We have reaſon to believe this unexpected change was not wrought without <hi>Berengarius:</hi> For we find he had no inclination to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again into <hi>Italy,</hi> where <hi>Lothari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> governed, but ſpent the reſt of his life at Court, had his ſhare in thoſe troubles which came thick upon the Emperour in his latter days, and died at <hi>Paris</hi> with the repute of one of the wiſeſt and greateſt Captains of his <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>840</label> Age. It was indeed his misfortune to be the chief Inſtrument in King <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>'s ruine, which if he had foreſeen, no doubt he would have declined the employment.</p>
            <p>He left his Son <hi>Otho</hi> ſo young that he never appeared at the Court of <hi>Lotharius,</hi> who beſides had no kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93968:29"/>
for his Family; but when his Son <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>856</label> 
               <hi>Lewis</hi> the Second came to the Empire, <hi>Otho</hi> got as much into his favour as <hi>Berengarius</hi> had done into that of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> or of <hi>Lewis</hi> his Son. He had been trained up in Military Diſcipline under his Father, for which the Emperour made him General of the Horſe; and this charge requiring his conſtant attendance at Court, the management of his affairs in <hi>Italy</hi> was left to his friends. He had the City and Territory of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machio</hi> given him as a reward of his and his fathers ſervices done to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown; which is evident by the Grant from the Emperour yet to be ſeen among the antient records of <hi>Eſté.</hi> Nor doth this a little aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the injuſtice of <hi>Clement</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the family of <hi>Eſté,</hi> who ſeizing upon the Dutchy of <hi>Ferrara</hi> in the Year 1598. upon a pretended devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution took from them at the ſame time the City of <hi>Commachio</hi> with its Territory, which they only ow'd to the Emperours bounty, and to which the Pope or Church could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any Title: but truly the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93968:30"/>
of <hi>Clement</hi> in this whole buſineſs was moſt illegal and tyrannical, as I queſtion not, before I conclude this Hiſtory, to make appear to all who are not highly partial.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> who were ever jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their growing Neighbours, did what they could to keep <hi>Otho</hi>'s Son <hi>Marinus</hi> from taking poſſeſſion of <hi>Commachio;</hi> and failing in this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed freſh arts to thruſt him out. <hi>Marinus</hi> heard of their practices, and had ſecret information that the <hi>Doge</hi>'s Brother was to paſs within a few miles of <hi>Commachio,</hi> in his way to <hi>Rome,</hi> to treat with the Pope about it: <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> to prevent this, took a raſh and injuſtifiable courſe; for having laid wait for the Ambaſſadour, he brought him to the City, and made him there ſwear, that neither he nor his Brother ſhould ever attempt any thing in prejudice of <hi>Commachio</hi> or of what belong'd to his Father.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> highly reſenting the affront they here received in the perſon of the Ambaſſadour, ſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately their Navy againſt <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machio,</hi> which being ill provided,

could not long hold out, <hi>Marinus</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd firſt to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> then into <hi>France,</hi> where having given an account to his Father of what had happen'd, he ſoon after fell ſick and died.

               <hi>Italy</hi> reaped no benefit by its union with <hi>France;</hi> the Imperial Crown had of late been ſet upon ſome Heads that did ill fit it: For the Race of <hi>Charles the Great</hi> was ſtrangely dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, and almoſt ſpent; the late Emperour <hi>Carolus Craſſus,</hi> who at firſt filled the Empire with the expectation of an extraordinary Prince, was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards laid aſide for inſufficiency, and brought ſo low as not to have a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant left him, nor any thing allowed for his maintenance except what flowed from the Biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi>'s Charity. <hi>Arnulphus</hi> who came after him found more buſineſs in <hi>Germany</hi> than he could well deal with; and <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Provence</hi> was making haſte towards <hi>Pavia,</hi> nothing doubting the Conqueſt of <hi>Italy.</hi> Moſt of the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> therefore being weary of a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Yoke began to think of chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Prince of their own Nation, a bleſſing they had not enjoyed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ages. <hi>Vido</hi> Duke of <hi>Spoletum,</hi> and <hi>Berengarius</hi> Duke of <hi>Friuli</hi> both deſcended of <hi>Charles the Great</hi> by

            <p>He came to the Crown by the ſame difficult ſteps his Grandfather <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius</hi> the firſt had done, which made many hope he would imitate him in his Princely Virtues, and reſtore to <hi>Italy</hi> that Government which they were not ſenſible of while they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd it. Yet his carriage preſently diſcovered that he deſign'd nothing leſs, ſeeing he neglected thoſe whom the ties both of nature and gratitude ought to have made him regard. What in all outward appearance could

have been more for the Intereſt of <hi>Hugo</hi> and <hi>Azo</hi> of <hi>Eſté</hi> after their Grandfathers death than to have their Brother Emperour; but it proved much otherwiſe, for <hi>Berengarius,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther jealous of <hi>Hugo</hi>'s aſpiring to the Crown, whom he knew to be popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and bold; or ſtill angry when he reflected how much he and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were careſſed at Court in their Grandfathers time, took all occaſions to ſlight and diſcountenance them. <hi>Hugo</hi> could hardly bear ſuch ill uſage, and juſt when his long-ſtifled anger was ready to break out, as fair an occaſion of being revenged upon <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius</hi> preſented it ſelf as <hi>Hugo</hi> could have deſired.</p>

               <hi>Hugo</hi> who knew nothing to be more natural to <hi>Berengarius</hi> than cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, being ſenſible of the Queens danger, whom he judg'd not likely to yield, generouſly ventur'd all to reſcue her, and oblige <hi>Otho</hi> King of <hi>Germany,</hi> for whom <hi>Adeleidis</hi> was deſigned before her impriſonment. Having therefore got without ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion into the Caſtle where ſhe was kept in the midſt of a Lake, by the help of a Prieſt, of whoſe fidelity and courage he had formerly experience, the Queen was let down out of a Window, and convey'd away in a Boat which lay ready for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, into the next Wood, where ſhe

            <p>The vaſt poſſeſſions fallen to <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> by his Fathers death might have invited him home, had he not been deeply engaged at the Emperours Court.

               <hi>Berengarius,</hi> he gave his Daughter, by <hi>Adeleidis</hi> named <hi>Alda,</hi> in marriage to <hi>Albertus,</hi> with ten Caſtles in <hi>Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and the City of <hi>Friburgh</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the death of <hi>Otho</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> diſſenſions aroſe about the Succeſſion, for his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> truſting in his Intereſt, with the neighbour Princes, endeavoured to wreſt the Imperial Crown from his Nephew <hi>Otho</hi> the ſecond. But <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> being zealous for the young Prince, engaged ſo many in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, as made good the Juſtice of his Cauſe againſt the Uſurper. This did beget him the irreconcileable hatred of <hi>Henry,</hi> which he little valued, while he was ſo faſt united to the Emperour. <hi>Harald</hi> King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was one of thoſe that declared for <hi>Henry,</hi> and brought an Army to the Fields to over-aw thoſe who ſhould offer to oppoſe him; but <hi>Albertus</hi> with the Emperours Forces gave him ſuch a blow, that all his threats end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a peace with <hi>Otho</hi> upon very unequal terms.</p>
            <p>Things thus ſetled at home, <hi>Otho</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:93968:38"/>
the ſecond went to free <hi>Naples</hi> from the <hi>Saracens,</hi> whom the <hi>Greeks</hi> had called in; the flower of the <hi>German</hi> Nobility accompanied him in this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; and <hi>Albertus</hi> hoping his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence might then be diſpenſed with, ſtopped in <hi>Lombardy</hi> to look into the concerns of his Family, which the Emperours Affairs had made him long neglect. <hi>Otho</hi> gave the <hi>Saracens</hi> bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle under the walls of <hi>Benevent,</hi> where by the treachery of the <hi>Romans</hi> his Army was overthrown, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf made his eſcape moſt miraculouſly after having been ſometime, though unknown, in the enemies hands. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> having the news of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours defeat haſted towards him with what Troops he could raiſe, and came in time to help to reunite the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours ſcatter'd Army, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon made head againſt the <hi>Saracens</hi> when they leaſt expected it; kill'd all that made any reſiſtance, and then purſuing the advantage, never gave them time to breathe till they had cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them out of <hi>Naples;</hi> from thence had <hi>Otho</hi> the title of <hi>Saracenicus</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him. At his return to <hi>Rome,</hi> he
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93968:38"/>
treated thoſe who had betrayed him with the utmoſt ſeverity, and was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on to ſee deeper every day into their indirect practices, when he was ſeized with a deſperate feaver which killed him in a few dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Otho</hi> the third came to the Crown ſo young, that <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s ill ſucceſs formerly did not diſcourage him from a ſecond attempt; he had got the young Prince into his hands, pretending he was his Guardian, and that till he were of age none ought to queſtion his Right to Govern. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> who well underſtood if <hi>Henry</hi> ſucceeded in this, ſo long as he lived, <hi>Otho</hi> was never like to enter upon the Government, ſhew'd no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern now than he had done formerly for <hi>Otho</hi> the ſecond. Others who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member'd that he had been too hard for <hi>Henry,</hi> were encouraged to joyn, and form'd a ſtrong confederacy in defence of <hi>Otho,</hi> that <hi>Henry</hi> ſeeing the difficulty of the enterprize, with the doubtfulneſs of the ſucceſs gave it over.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albertus</hi> lived to ſee <hi>Otho</hi> the third in ſure poſſeſſion of the Crown which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:93968:39"/>
he had been ſo eminently inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in ſetting both upon his, and his Fathers head. Never did any man promote the intereſt of Princes more than <hi>Albertus</hi> did that of the three Emperours under whom he lived, nor have we any ground to tax them of backwardneſs in acknowledging his merits. He was honour'd with <hi>Otho</hi> the firſt's Daughter in marriage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Otho</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Otho</hi> the third, he had the chief truſts of the Government committed to him, and had ſuch a ſtrange influence upon all their Counſels, that nothing but the aſſurance of his integrity could have juſtified their prudence in placing any man in ſo high a ſphere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alda</hi> brought him three Sons, the eldeſt was <hi>Hugo</hi> the ſecond, who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Father, not only in his Poſſeſſions and Title, but which is a rare thing, in his Intereſt at Court. About this time <hi>Rome</hi> grew big with a new project of ſetting up an <hi>Italian</hi> Monarchy in oppoſition to the Emperours. The ſeverity, or as ſome termed it, the cruelty of <hi>Otho</hi> 
               <label type="milestone">

an unalterable prejudice againſt his Family and his Nation, and thoſe who expected to advance their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes by a change, did moſt careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foment theſe humours. The great Engine which moved all was one <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentius,</hi> who according to the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter given him by the <hi>Italian</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters wanted none of the qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neceſſary for ſuch an underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: Upon all occaſions he did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt the Emperour with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual boldneſs and eloquence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining how much his Countrey-mens ſpirits were debaſed from thoſe of their Anceſtors, in ſuffering a dull phlegmatick People, and a Prieſt (the <hi>Germans</hi> he mean'd and the <hi>Pope)</hi> to keep the Miſtriſs of the world thus in ſlavery. Being created Conſul he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to retrieve ſome of the loſt Power to that empty name, and began with the Pope whom he chaſed from <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſo he might order things as he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Otho</hi> had notice of all that paſt; and judging it a buſineſs of too great conſequence to be neglected, ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward towards <hi>Rome,</hi> accompanied by

his Couſin the Marqueſs of <hi>Eſté,</hi> and many of the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. In his march he had advice of the Popes death, which made him create a Kinſman of his own, and a <hi>German,</hi> Pope, by the name of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the fifth, whom he ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> before him to ſee if they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in his choice. <hi>Creſcentius</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> to divert the preſent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, received the new Pope with much outward reſpect, confeſſed their raſhneſs in calling the Emperours Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in queſtion, and readily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed entire ſubmiſſion for the future, though it ſoon appeared they intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing leſs: for ſcarce was the Emperour gone when the former project being again ſet on foot, <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> was rejected as an Uſurper; and <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Piacenza</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> by Nation, friend to <hi>Creſcentius,</hi> and the richeſt Prelate of <hi>Italy,</hi> placed in the Chair.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Otho</hi> enraged at their proceedings made what preparation he could for a new Expedition, reſolving not to be put off a ſecond time with fair words; with the <hi>German</hi> Army, and

            <p>All muſt own that <hi>Creſcentius</hi> did not make good his promiſe to <hi>Otho;</hi> yet this could not vindicate <hi>Otho</hi>'s breach of his Royal word, or ſecure him from the ſubtle contrivances of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who vowed the death of <hi>Creſcentius</hi> ſhould be revenged; and they had ſo ordered the matter, that when the Emperour fancied himſelf free from all danger, he muſt have fallen into their hands, had not his Coſin <hi>Hugo</hi> of <hi>Eſté</hi> diſappointed them, by conveying him away by night. The ſenſe of ſo narrow a deliverance, with <hi>Hugo</hi>'s great performances in this and the former expedition, made <hi>Otho</hi> Create him Marqueſs of <hi>Italy,</hi> a Title <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1000</label> never given to any other. This ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Hugo</hi> ſo conſpicuous, that the Hiſtories of thoſe Times call him the Marqueſs without any further diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as we gather from <hi>Arnulphus</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> and <hi>Scafnaburgenſis,</hi> and even down to the time of <hi>Villani</hi> and <hi>Dante;</hi> when they ſpoke of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, he of <hi>Eſté</hi> is to be underſtood,

            </p>
            <p>Though <hi>Hugo</hi> had helped the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to humble the <hi>Romans,</hi> and by diſcovering the Conſpiracy againſt his perſon, ſeem'd to have brought things to that hopefull paſs, that there remained no further ground for fears; yet the reſtleſs attempts of <hi>Otho</hi>'s ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at length ſucceeded, for ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Gloves were preſented him by <hi>Creſcentius</hi>'s widow, in which the richneſs of the perfume did cover ſuch a deadly poiſon as kill'd him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Phyſicians knew he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: this the ambitious Woman was ſaid to have done, not ſo much upon her husbands account, as for the affront done to her ſelf, whom the Emperour promiſed to marry, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards changed his inclinations, which her haughty Spirit could not digeſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Otho</hi> the third dying without Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> came to the Crown, which his Father had ſo much coveted in the minority of the two late Emperours; and was as I have

already mentioned, oppoſed in it by <hi>Albertus</hi> of <hi>Eſté;</hi> nor did their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel end with their lives, but was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail'd upon their Sons, as might be ſeen in <hi>Henry,</hi> who from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning diſcovered a diſlike to <hi>Hugo's</hi> management of the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> and let drop ſome expreſſions that he deſigned to remove him from all Publick Truſt, as ſoon as he found himſelf ſetled. This prepoſterous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution loſt him <hi>Italy</hi> for ſome years, becauſe <hi>Hugo</hi> having notice of it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his whole intereſt to exclude <hi>Henry</hi> and ſet up <hi>Ardoinus</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Eporoedia,</hi> who ſupported likewiſe by moſt of the Nobility of <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy</hi> came without much oppoſition to be choſen King at <hi>Pavia.</hi> The ſucceſs he had at his entry upon the Government againſt <hi>Henries</hi> Army put him in peaceable poſſeſſion of his Crown, the diſturbances of <hi>Germany</hi> not allowing <hi>Henry</hi> to look any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at preſent. The only perſon <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doinus</hi> could never gain was the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> who ceaſed not to ſolicite <hi>Henry</hi> till he brought the <hi>Germans</hi> again into <hi>Italy,</hi> and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93968:42"/>
then did <hi>Ardoinus</hi> part with his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom upon as eaſie terms as he had got it; and <hi>Hugo</hi> was fain to retire to the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperours General in <hi>Naples,</hi> whither <hi>Henry</hi> purſued him, and took him priſoner with his three Sons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> having got <hi>Hugo</hi> and his Sons in his power, did beyond their expectation ſhew a rare example of clemency; for when in them he might have extirpated the family, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring his raſh expreſſions had in a <label type="milestone">

all Reigning at once, paſſed into <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> called a Councel at <hi>Rome,</hi> where <hi>Benedict</hi> the ninth, <hi>Sylveſter</hi> the third, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſixth being convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of ſeveral Crimes, were all laid aſide, and <hi>Clement</hi> the ſecond cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Pope; and for preventing ſuch abuſes, it was Decreed, That none ſhould be admitted for the future, except ſuch as the Emperour appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of; all that were preſent at the Council confirmed it by Oath; and during the reſt of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, this method of Election was obſerved: But <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left young under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Mother, the <hi>Romans</hi> when there was nothing to apprehend for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got their Oath, and made choice of <hi>Stephen</hi> the ninth, without conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Emperour: Soon after they openly declared, he was not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle either in the nomination or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of Popes; and this Doctrine never openly taught before, in a ſhort time by the Empreſſes conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence, and the countenance it had from <hi>Matildis</hi> and her Mother, was ſo univerſally received, that <hi>Henry</hi>

when he came of age, found his chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging it as a right the ſource of all his calamities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matildis</hi> gave early proof of her blind attachment to the Pope, which her Husband (either to ſecure a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon occaſion againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or to comply with <hi>Matildis</hi>'s inclinations) did much encourage at firſt, and grew ſenſible of his folly in it too late, when he ſaw her forget not only her duty to her Soveraign the Emperour, but likewiſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who was her husband.</p>
            <p>The perſon that bewitched <hi>Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> was <hi>Hildibrand,</hi> afterwards <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the ſeventh, to whoſe Councils ſhe gave her ſelf up ſo entirely, that her Forces, her Money, and her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts were all at his diſpoſal. <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibrand</hi> was of mean extraction, the Son (as <hi>Cranzius</hi> an accurate writer ſayes) of a Smith, and deſigned for a Monk; but being more enclined to buſineſs than devotion, or a retired life, he abandon'd the Cloiſter, and went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where his natural ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and ambition, masked with an appearance of virtue and a publick
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93968:46"/>
ſpirit, raiſed him in a few years to ſuch a pitch, that whatſoever Pope they choſe without his conſent, was ſoon diſpatch'd; and even thoſe whom he advanced, if they prov'd not for his purpoſe had no better luck, as <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> and other of their Writers inform us. By the means of one <hi>Brazutus</hi> his old acquaintance in the Magick School, no leſs than ſix Popes were poiſon'd in thirteen years. Every one could eaſily diſcern how well <hi>Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> was like to thrive in ſuch hands.</p>
            <p>The Pope that immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded <hi>Hildibrand</hi> was <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſecond, formerly Biſhop of <hi>Luca,</hi> whom he had ſet up in oppoſition to the Emperour, but eas'd him of the trouble of governing; the Biſhops therefore of <hi>Lombardy</hi> not longer able to ſee <hi>Henries</hi> Authority thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, the decree of their Council ſlighted, and their oath broken, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded the Emperour to call a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at <hi>Baſil,</hi> where <hi>Alexander</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared an Uſurper, and <hi>Cadolus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Parma</hi> choſen Pope by the name of <hi>Honorius</hi> the ſecond; moſt of the Prelates and Nobility of <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy</hi>

accompanied <hi>Honorius</hi> in his journey to <hi>Rome;</hi> but <hi>Matildis</hi> at the head of an Army oppoſed him and the Emperour, in behalf of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Hildibrand.</hi> After many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts both parties agreeing to hold a <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1063</label> Council at <hi>Mantoua,</hi> the Emperour, though there preſent was betrayed; for <hi>Matildis</hi> by <hi>Hildibrands</hi> direction corrupting one part of the Council, and over-awing another in her own City, had <hi>Honorius</hi> caſt, and <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> confirmed: And <hi>Hildibrand</hi> not ſatisfied with the Popes Authority, and his Revenue, procured a doſe to be given <hi>Alexander</hi> to make way for himſelf.</p>
            <p>From one raiſed by ſuch ſteps they could not but expect extraordinary things; at firſt he ſeemed to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Emperours reſentment of his illegal election, but <hi>Matildis</hi> offering to ſacrifice Life and Fortune in his Cauſe, quickly removed his fears, and <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1073</label> encouraged him to write to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in a ſtyle not uſed by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors; nor was this all, he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned him by his New Authority to appear perſonally at <hi>Rome,</hi> there to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93968:47"/>
anſwer in a Synod to ſuch Articles as were brought againſt him, threatning that if he refuſed to come, he would paſs to the ſentence of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The diviſions of <hi>Germany</hi> made the Emperour unwilling to come to a breach with the Pope, who he knew had made ſure of <hi>Matildis;</hi> yet no reaſonable condeſcenſion being able to ſatisfie <hi>Gregory,</hi> they adviſed the Emperour to take the ſtart of him, and to aſſemble a Council at <hi>Wormes</hi> to look firſt into <hi>Gregories</hi> actions. At the opening of this Aſſembly, ſtrange were the accuſations brought in againſt <hi>Gregory,</hi> and none plainer than thoſe of <hi>Hugo,</hi> one of his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, who preſented Letters from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſigned by many perſons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuſpected integrity, ſhewing at large his Crimes, both before and after his coming to the Papacy; and how the Election was carried for him by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tildis</hi> and her Guards, whoſe acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſerved him to better purpoſe, than the Votes of thoſe who were to chuſe. All which being impartially examined and conſidered, <hi>Gregory,</hi> as the Abbot of <hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matildis</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> all this while were very hard at work, ſhe in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Forces to defend the Pope, if any ſhould attempt to diſpoſſeſs him, and he in laying out her treaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Biſhops, that things might paſs againſt <hi>Henry,</hi> according to their minds in the Synod appointed at <hi>Rome.</hi> Little did they think that any durſt have proclaimed the Decree of <hi>Wormes</hi> in an Aſſembly compoſed of <hi>Gregories</hi> own Creatures, and where he in perſon did preſide, guarded by <hi>Matildis</hi>'s troops: but one <hi>Roland</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Parma</hi> coming boldly up, without paying him any reſpect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him, in the name of the moſt Religious Emperour, and of the moſt Reverend Biſhops of <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> to reſign the Sacred Charge, into which by craft, ſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

and other evil arts he had thruſt himſelf: declaring that he was no true <hi>Shepherd, Father</hi> nor <hi>Pope,</hi> but a <hi>Thief,</hi> a <hi>Wolf,</hi> and a <hi>Tyrant:</hi> and while all were in a conſternation to hear ſuch words, <hi>Roland</hi> happily made his eſcape.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matildis</hi> was now become a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow by the death of the Duke of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> and had indeed liv'd as ſuch for ſeveral years paſt; her jealouſie of the Dukes being no friend to <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> made her afraid to be adviſed by him, or to allow him leave to meddle in her affairs; and her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band upon the other hand ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf neglected and no gainer at all by his great Match, retired into his own Countrey full of trouble, and ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his Father but a few years. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> judging it againſt his intereſt to have <hi>Matildis</hi> married to any foreign Prince, in whom he could have no confidence, propoſed to her <hi>Azo</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Eſté,</hi> who was the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all the <hi>Lombards</hi> that had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver countenanced <hi>Honorius</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, but adhered to <hi>Alexander</hi> and him: <hi>Matildis</hi> readily accepted of

               <hi>Gregories</hi> choice of her Couſin for a Husband, nothing doubting but he would eſpouſe the Popes concerns as much as ſhe had done; and <hi>Azo</hi> ſeemed glad likewiſe of ſo rich a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe as he hoped <hi>Matildis</hi> might prove. Yet both parties were fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated of their expectation, as we learn by what follow'd.</p>
            <p>But to return to the Synod at <hi>Rome,</hi> there <hi>Gregory</hi> carried things with a high hand, thundering the ſentence of Excommunication againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and his followers, freeing his Subjects from their Allegiance, and exhorting the Princes to come to a new Election; nor did he ſtop here, but encouraged by the party he had made in <hi>Germany,</hi> declared he would meet a Synod at <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> that what had paſt at <hi>Rome</hi> againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour might be confirmed there, as the Sentence of <hi>Wormes</hi> againſt him had been confirmed in <hi>Italy.</hi> Great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations were made for his journey, his affairs in his abſence were recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the care of <hi>Matildis,</hi> who he knew would never fail him; and ſhe with her Army intended to

ſee him ſafe within the borders of <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperour obſerving the ill effects theſe proceedings already had upon the factious party, durſt not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the iſſue of <hi>Gregories</hi> journey, but reſolved to prevent it by hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling himſelf to any terms; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon with a ſmall train poſted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Gregory,</hi> who was not yet got out of <hi>Italy.</hi>

this manner, and appear not ſo much like an humble ſupplicant as a criminal; a poſture which ill became a <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, and the firſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate of <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was it leſs ſtrange to ſee <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tildis</hi> the Emperours Couſin-German by her Mother, enriched by his and his Fathers bounty, ſo eaſily to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get both the ties of Nature and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and to ſupport the Pope in all theſe extravagancies. If ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved ill things of the Emperour while yet in <hi>Germany;</hi> and that he would not agree to any reaſonable propoſals, none can much wonder, who conſiders her information came only from the Pope; but to ſee him ſo ignominiouſly treated at her own houſe, and to approve of it, ſhewed in her little ſenſe of honour, and great want of diſcernment.</p>
            <p>It proved much otherwiſe with her Husband <hi>Azo,</hi> who hitherto had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been abuſed; but being an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs of <hi>Gregories</hi> inſolence, he did afterwards ſerve the Emperour all he could; this coſt him dear, for <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> perceiving it, uſed arts to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:93968:50"/>
the affections of <hi>Matildis</hi> from him, and then grounded a divorce upon their being within thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of conſanguinity to which the Canons deny marriage. While <hi>Azo</hi> continued of <hi>Gregories</hi> party this was never queſtion'd, and being now of the Emperours, it was too late to hope for a diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>It ſeems ſtrange that <hi>Baronius</hi> ſhould be at ſo great pains to perſwade the world, that <hi>Matildis</hi> was never marri'd to <hi>Azo,</hi> when the ſtrongeſt of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amount to no more than a few Chronological ſcruples which cannot weaken the teſtimony of ſo many ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Authors that writ before him. It is obſerved he had an excellent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of raiſing doubts, which would any wiſe make for his purpoſe, and it appears plainly in this, becauſe he deſigns it to help <hi>Matildis</hi> to paſs for a Virgin, but her marriage firſt to the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and afterwards to the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> leave no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for this pretence: And if we give credit to the Hiſtories of thoſe times, though ſhe had never been married, the freedom ſhe was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93968:50"/>
to allow <hi>Gregory,</hi> put her out of the category of Virgins. How much would the Abbot of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſpergh, Scaff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naburgenſis, Benno, Lambertus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, have pitied the ignorance, or rather partiality of our age, had they imagined <hi>Matildis</hi> was to be ſet up for either Virgin or Saint amongſt us. But we cannot lay any blame upon them, who ſpared not to repreſent her to poſterity in her true colours.</p>
            <p>The Emperour had no benefit by his ſubmiſſion, the Rebels in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence having crown'd <hi>Rodolphus</hi> Duke of <hi>Suevia</hi> King, whoſe Election <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> confirmed, and thereby made the breach wider than ever. But though the Pope declared for the Uſurper, heaven favoured the better Cauſe. <hi>Rodolphus</hi> was overcome in four ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral battles, and received a mortal wound in the laſt, together with the loſs of his right hand, which being brought to him alittle before his death, he confeſſed Gods Juſtice in the manner of his puniſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with that hand he had ſigned the Oath of Allegiance to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, and afterwards perfidiouſly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:93968:51"/>
lift it up againſt him. While <hi>Henry</hi> was employed to maintain his Right in <hi>Germany, Lombardy</hi> lay expoſed to <hi>Matildis,</hi> who heavily perſecuted the Loyal Party, eſpecially <hi>Gilbertus,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Emperours beſt friend.</p>
            <p>A little before <hi>Rodolphus</hi>'s death <hi>Henry</hi> call'd a Synod at <hi>Brixina</hi> in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> where thirty Biſhops did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain depoſe <hi>Gregory,</hi> and chuſe <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> Pope. Among the Crimes laid to <hi>Gregories</hi> Charge, I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve two; the former is that of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, as being one of <hi>Berengarius</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and of the ſame Sentiments; but thoſe of his party need not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour much to vindicate him in this particular, ſeeing none I preſume will endeavour to bring <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh in as a witneſs to the truth, or a forerunner of the Reformation. The Doctrine of <hi>Berengarius</hi> had ſtronger Pillars in all Ages to ſupport it, than the Infallibility of ſuch a Pope, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whoſe Patronage Truth it ſelf might have been ſuſpected; nor could Satan more effectually recommend an
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:93968:51"/>
errour to all well-meaning men, than by procuring <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh to oppoſe it. In a word, if <hi>Gregory</hi> really embraced this truth, no wonder if it then proved unſucceſsfull, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it for better times, and for better inſtruments. The other Crime which they had better reaſon to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten upon him, was his ſeparating Wives from their Husbands; and in this undoubtedly they had an eye to <hi>Matildis,</hi> whom he had firſt parted from the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards moſt unjuſtly divorced from <hi>Azo</hi> of <hi>Eſté,</hi> a thing really worthy of the cognizance of that Synod.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> being now at leiſure to call <hi>Matildis</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> to an account for their cruelty to his friends, and to ſee <hi>Clement</hi> the third Enſtall'd, bent his whole Forces againſt <hi>Italy,</hi> and <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1084</label> notwithſtanding all <hi>Matil is</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, went directly to <hi>Rome,</hi> nothing except <hi>Florence</hi> giving him any ſtop. <hi>Rome</hi> againſt which the chief deſign was laid, wanted neither proviſion nor troops, and <hi>Gregory</hi> was there in perſon performing all the parts of a good Officer during the ſiege. Upon
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:93968:52"/>
the ſurrender of the City, he retired to the Caſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Angelo,</hi> &amp; from thence to the <hi>Normans</hi> in <hi>Naples,</hi> whom he had engaged in his quarrel; but finding them in no condition to reſtore him, nor the <hi>Romans</hi> diſpoſed to receive him again, who had for many years behaved himſelf ſo imperiouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: and laſt of all, the paſſage for <hi>Matildis</hi> being ſo ſhut up by the Emperours Forces, that ſhe could not come to his aſſiſtance; trouble and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, when he ſaw he was thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in his old age, occaſion'd a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which in a few dayes put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to his life.</p>
            <p>He was Canonized after his death, as <hi>Baronius</hi> informs us in his <hi>Roman</hi> Martyrology; but whence they had the proofs, either of the ſanctity of his life, or the miracles he wrought, we cannot gueſs. The Characters not only given him by his Contemporaries who writ of him, but by the Synods of <hi>Wormes, Pavia, Mentzs</hi> and <hi>Brixina</hi> did little countenance this deſign; his apparent Miracles, if any ſuch were alledged, did flow from the ſame ſource with thoſe of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:93968:52"/>
Magicians, in whoſe ſtudies he had ſpent ſome part of his youth, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the ſpirit of prophecy when he foretold the Emperours death, of which he thought he had made ſure; but his Inſtruments failing him, he was fain to ſave his credit by an equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: And to ſay no worſe, their thruſting <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſeventh in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints, gives us juſt ground to ſuſpect their Catalogue is not ſo pure as it ought to be; and that all to whom they addreſs themſelves, are not in ſo happy a ſtate as their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken ſuperſtition is willing to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>It was hoped <hi>Gregories</hi> death would have calm'd the ſtorm, and that the Emperour might afterwards enjoy his Crown, and <hi>Clement</hi> the third his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity without diſturbance, if grief had killed <hi>Matildis</hi> at the ſame time as it was like to have done: But <hi>Gregory</hi> by his laſt Will recommending his party with much earneſtneſs to her protection, the war and the Schiſm were continued.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Welpho</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and his Son of the ſame name, Rebels former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:93968:53"/>
with <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> began to ſow new diviſions in <hi>Germany;</hi> whereupon <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the ſecond, the true, though not immediate ſucceſſour of <hi>Hildi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand,</hi> judged the young Prince a perſon fitly qualified for a Husband to <hi>Matildis;</hi> and the match was quickly made up, where the parties both aimed at the ſame thing, that is, the Emperours depreſſion. This did further declare their great injuſtice to her former Husband, for <hi>Welpho</hi> was a Grand-child of the Houſe of <hi>Eſté,</hi> nearly related to <hi>Matildis</hi> as well as <hi>Azo,</hi> only there was no cauſe to ſuſpect him of being in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours confidence: But ſuch indirect courſes were juſtly blaſted, and <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho</hi> reconciled after ſome time to <hi>Henry,</hi> by which he loſt <hi>Matildis,</hi> whoſe love to her Husbands was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes grounded upon their devotion to the Pope; he could not both be the Emperours friend and <hi>Matildis</hi> Husband, and therefore a new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was found out for a divorce. A greater Title was deſign'd for <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tildis</hi> by the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperour, who ſent an Ambaſſador to court her in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93968:53"/>
his Name; but <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> who could promiſe himſelf no good by ſending her ſo far from home, diſſwaded her from any ſuch thoughts: And now her zeal growing with her years, no Title pleaſed her ſo well, as to hear her ſelf every day called the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter,</hi> the pillar of the Truth, and the Protectreſs of the Church: names invented by the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to gratifie the humour of a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted Woman.</p>
            <p>There remained ſtill one expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ruine the Emperour, which was to perſwade his Son <hi>Conrard</hi> that he ow'd him no Duty, but that he might take up Arms againſt him, and ſeize upon the Crown, which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by being cut off from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church, had forfeited long ago. Thus did <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> ſtir up a Rebellion more unnatural and black than any <hi>Gregory</hi> had attempted; and what the Popes Words made lawfull, <hi>Matildis</hi> Army made practicable: ſo <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1094</label> that <hi>Conrard</hi> coming into <hi>Italy</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Crown, but juſtly was he puniſhed with a ſhort reign, for his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurping that which with honour and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93968:54"/>
ſecurity by the courſe of Nature, he might e're long have expected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conrards</hi> death did break all their meaſures, yet they could not diſpair while the Emperour had another Son, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> was dead, and <hi>Paſcalis</hi> in his place who debauch'd <hi>Henry</hi> from his <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1105</label> Duty, as much as his predeceſſour had done his elder Brother, and was aſſiſted in it by ſome about the young Prince, whom <hi>Matildis</hi> had corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A meeting of all the Emperours enemies being held at <hi>Mentz,</hi> the Arch-biſhops of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Collogue</hi> were ſent to the Emperour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Crown for his Son; the Emperour underſtanding the buſineſs for which they came, deſired to know the reaſon why they proceeded ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely againſt him; it was anſwered, becauſe he had made a Schiſm in the Church, had expoſed Eccleſiaſtical dignities to ſale, and had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the Canons in his choice of Biſhops. To this the Emperour ſmartly reply'd, If you pretend I have ſold Dignities, what had I, pray, from either of you for the Arch-biſhopricks of <hi>Mentz</hi> and <hi>Collogne,</hi> the greateſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93968:54"/>
and richeſt of <hi>Germany?</hi> You who turn accuſers are beſt able to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate me, and ought to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance thoſe who are guilty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt me their Soveraign: Many other conſiderations he laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, but they ſtill inſiſting, he deſired at leaſt a day might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in which he ſhould reſign his Crown, that both for his honour and theirs, it might ſeem his own volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary act: This reaſonable requeſt alſo was denied, and the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Mentz</hi> moſt impudently coming up to him, ſnatch'd away his Crown, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by his example ſtrip'd him of his Purple, and the other marks of Royalty, and carried them to his Son, who was immediately declared King, and confirmed by the Popes Legates. The Old Emperour retired to <hi>Liege:</hi> thither his Friends reſorted from all hands to aſſiſt him in the recovery of his Crown; with theſe he gave bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to his Sons Army, and was at firſt ſucceſsfull: Yet money and large promiſes having corrupted his party, he was abandon'd by all, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair and neceſſity was forced to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:93968:55"/>
make his application to the Biſhop of <hi>Spire,</hi> that he might be received a petty Canon in a Church which he himſelf had there founded; but this ſmall favour being alſo beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample denied him, he died within a few dayes, leaving to poſterity one of the greateſt inſtances, perhaps that any age has afforded, of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of worldly grandeur.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who were much wedded to the Intereſts of <hi>Rome,</hi> could preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcover the immediate hand of Divine Providence, revenging in <hi>Henries</hi> death the long perſecution he had carried on againſt them, little reflecting that <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſevenths dying outed of his dignity, and in a moſt forlorn condition ſeveral years before, gave no leſs advantage to the Emperours party. Others therefore who were not byaſſed made no ſuch inference from thence, knowing if there were no ſurer arguments to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect men in their judgments than the undertakers ſucceſs, the beſt cauſes might oftentimes ſuffer, and the moſt palpable uſurpations be vindicated.</p>
            <p>The Pope and <hi>Matildis</hi> after they
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93968:55"/>
had compaſſed what they long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, thought it now an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to manage not only <hi>Italy</hi> but <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> alſo, and the young Prince as they pleaſed: All the grievances of their Party were to be redreſſed, and the pretended corruptions of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of <hi>Germany</hi> to be reformed in a Synod at <hi>Ausburgh,</hi> where the Pope the better to confirm his Authority among them, was to be preſent; but they were much diſappointed in <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the fifth, who as ſoon as he was ſetled in his Throne, began to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a ſtrong diſlike to their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with his Father, and as he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily wiſhed, he had no wayes been acceſſary to them; ſo to atone his guilt, his whole thoughts were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on maintaining the Dignity &amp; Prerogatives of his Crown, which had been ſo much violated by the late Rebellion.</p>
            <p>There was little encouragement then for the Pope to appear at <hi>Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> where he was ſure to be croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in whatſoever he propoſed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Henry</hi> had an Army in readineſs to go into <hi>Italy,</hi> there to receive the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93968:56"/>
Imperial Crown. It frighted <hi>Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> to hear of his coming in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, yet diſſembling her fears, ſhe was the firſt when he paſt the <hi>Alpes</hi> who ſent to welcome him: The Pope likewiſe with great expreſſions of confidence invited him to <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew he could not hinder his coming thither. Upon the day appointed for his Coronation, the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Milan,</hi> by whom ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom he had firſt been crowned King of <hi>Lombardy</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him to the Pope, who before he proceeded any further in the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, required him publickly to renounce all pretenſion to the colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or inveſtiture of Eccleſiaſtical Dignities; this <hi>Henry</hi> flatly refuſed to do, telling him he would not be tied to any ſuch conditions, and that he expected his Crown after the ſame manner that <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> his Son had received it; the conteſt laſted ſeveral dayes, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great heats, and threatnings on both hands, the Pope declaring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Henries</hi> refuſal to comply, that he muſt come to his ſpiritual Arms; and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93968:56"/>
               <hi>Henry</hi> letting him underſtand that his Army was ready at a call; ſo that nothing could perſwade <hi>Henry</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from this generous reſolution, not valuing the Popes Arms ſo much as the Troops he had brought with him from <hi>Germany:</hi> at length the Pope was forced to yield that as a Right to the Son which had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied his Father, and which <hi>Matildis</hi> and the former Popes had made the ground of all their wars. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour prouder of retrieving this loſt Prerogative than of the Imperial Crown returned to <hi>Germany,</hi> where the firſt thing he did, was to ſee his Fathers body enterr'd; a favour his enemies malice had not thought fit to allow it.</p>
            <p>No wonder if it pierced <hi>Matildis</hi> to the heart to ſee all her encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Emperours power for ſo many years brought to nought in a moment, and the Papal Authority, which with ſo much coſt, pains and danger ſhe had highly advanced, now reduc'd to what ſhe had found it in the beginning of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourths reign, and all this by one whom <hi>Paſcalis</hi> and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93968:57"/>
ſhe had helped to ſet up upon his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ruines; grief then and old age caſt her into a languiſhing diſtemper which in the end proved mortal.</p>
            <p>She had all along deſigned, that not only the Popes, in whoſe times ſhe lived, but their Succeſſours alſo ſhould reap the fruits of her bounty, which made her eaſily hearken to thoſe who judged it the ſecureſt way to put the Church in poſſeſſion of the beſt part of her territories, and that it muſt be a particular ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſee her own will executed to prevent the trouble it might occaſion after her death, and to hear the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Panegyricks of thoſe who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled her munificence, and whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt it was ſo to do. By theſe inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations they had already got into their hands that which is called the Patrimony of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter,</hi> with ſeveral Cities in <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> And now leſt upon <label type="milestone">

            <p>I cannot find ſhe was ever Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized, but the beſt of their Pens have
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93968:57"/>
been employed to celebrate her Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and her memory is ſtill more precious among them than that of moſt of their Saints; of this <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban</hi> the eighth in our own time, has given teſtimony by having her body, or what at leaſt paſt for it, tranſlated from a Church near <hi>Mantoua</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> where it lies buried in S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peters</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſtately Monument erected 1635. at his charge, with an Inſcription, which expreſſes both his value for her Piety and Virtue, and his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for her protection and bounty; and if oftentimes both in ſpeaking and writing of her they call her a Saint, it is no ſtrange thing, if one conſider the ſtile of the Countrey, according to what <hi>Philip de Comines</hi> obſerved in his paſſage through <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan;</hi> where wondering to read the name of one of their worſt Dukes, with this glorious Epithet of <hi>Saint</hi> upon the front of a Convent, a Prieſt ingenuouſly told him, it was their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to call all thoſe <hi>Saints</hi> to whom they were much obliged. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect then, envy it ſelf muſt allow, never any could lay juſter claim to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93968:58"/>
this title than <hi>Matildis,</hi> who deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed better of the Popes than any that went before her, or that hath been ſince her time: for let them amuſe men as much as they liſt with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended donations from <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> or from <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> it is plain, the Counteſs <hi>Matildis</hi> firſt ſet them up, and it is her whom <hi>Rome</hi> muſt chiefly thank, and others blame for the Popes bearing ſuch a figure ſince, among the Temporal Princes of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The event did verifie what was apprehended before, that <hi>Matildis</hi> actions would be called in queſtion afterwards; for <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared he would not agree to what ſhe had done, becauſe ſhe could not diſpoſe of what came to her by her Mother <hi>Beatrix,</hi> but that by her death it return'd to the Crown; and in truth there ſeem'd to be a great deal of reaſon in what the Emperour alledged, ſeeing it was too much that ſhe had abuſed while ſhe lived, the power derived from his Anceſtors, without entailing it for ever upon his enemies; the Pope on the other

               <p>An account of what past as well in the <hi>German</hi> as in the <hi>Italian</hi> branch of the Family from the death of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tildis,</hi> till <hi>Otho</hi> of <hi>Eſté</hi> Duke of <hi>Brumſwick</hi> was choſen Emperour.</p>

            <p>HAving inſiſted more largely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Matildis</hi> actions than ſo compendious a Hiſtory will well bear, I return to her Family, which ſhe like an unnatural branch, drawing ſap from the root, and beſtowing elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, had almoſt deſtroyed. Her Husband <hi>Azo,</hi> though he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver well digeſt the trouble conceived upon his divorce, yet lived long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with his Brother <hi>Bertoldus</hi> did meet <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth at his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93968:59"/>
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and had by the means of his Kinſman <hi>Welpho</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria, Matildis</hi> laſt Husband, a reception full of reſpect and kindneſs. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was not then to learn how much <hi>Azo</hi> or his Family had ſuffered by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to his Father, and therefore enlarged his priviledges, and gave him aſſurances of his protection; whether at that time he made known to the Emperour his juſt pretenſions to a ſhare of <hi>Matildis,</hi> Eſtate no Hiſtory that I have ſeen doth ſatisfie me; but it appears <hi>Bertoldus</hi>'s Son afterwards did highly reſent his having no repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration made him, and thereupon took Arms againſt the Emperour.</p>
            <p>The concerns of the Family not diſpenſing with the abſence of both Brothers, <hi>Azo</hi> after ſome dayes ſpent with the Emperour, took his leave, and returned to <hi>Eſté. Bertoldus</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he and <hi>Welpho</hi> were the perſons who compoſed all differences, and made a perfect reconciliation betwixt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and the Pope, upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made by the latter, not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in the affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:93968:59"/>
he and his predeceſſors had for many years embroiled; this gave <hi>Bertoldus</hi> great credit, and raiſed him ſo high in the Emperours confidence, that had not his Brothers death called him home, he muſt have gone into <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many;</hi> the reſt of his life being ſpent in governing his people, gives no great occaſion to the Hiſtorians to mention him, only we find at his death he left his Son <hi>Rinaldus</hi> very <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1137</label> young, who afterwards prov'd ſo great a General in the Wars of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> againſt <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other branch of the Family of <hi>Eſté</hi> raiſed to infinite riches and power in <hi>Germany,</hi> calls us thither till <hi>Rinaldus</hi> comes of age, and if it be at all to be called a digreſſion, yet I preſume it will be no unpleaſant one to the Reader: <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Eſté</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> married the Daughter of <hi>Lotharius</hi> the third, who ſucceeded <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth, and after the death of his Father in Law made war upon <hi>Conrard</hi> the third, for violating the Agreement made with him at his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation; <hi>Conrard</hi> to eaſe himſelf of ſome part of the burden of the War,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93968:60"/>
required the aſſiſtance of the Princes of the Empire in a Diet aſſembled for this purpoſe, in which he bitterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighed againſt <hi>Henry,</hi> yet contrary to his deſign, gave ample teſtimony both of the antiquity and greatneſs of the Family, as his Harangue ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſhews; he makes <hi>Henry</hi> an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart in <hi>Germany</hi> his great Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being the firſt that ſetled there, but at the ſame time he owns him to be of the blood of <hi>Eſté,</hi> deſcended of the Ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Family of the <hi>Atii,</hi> ſwell'd, as he ſayes, with the Names and Titles of his Anceſtors, he puts the Princes in mind of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of <hi>Henries</hi> Anceſtor <hi>Hugo,</hi> who ſtirred up <hi>Ardoinus</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Epo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roedia</hi> againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond: and laſt of all, he charges him with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of over-turning the Ancient Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of <hi>Germany,</hi> complaining that his Intereſt there joyned to that of his kindred in <hi>Italy</hi> was too like to effect it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi>'s death gave him not leave to vindicate himſelf and his Family from <hi>Conrards</hi> aſperſions, but his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Welpho</hi> did it in another Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

to the ſatisfaction of all there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that his Great Grand-father was a ſtranger in <hi>Germany,</hi> being of the blood of <hi>Eſté,</hi> and of the Illuſtrious Family of the <hi>Atii,</hi> he was not, he ſaid, aſhamed to own; but they all knew he was a <hi>German</hi> by his Great Grand-Mother, and that by her he inherited the rich Dutchy of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria:</hi> That <hi>Hugo</hi> of <hi>Eſté</hi> had coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced <hi>Ardoinus</hi> was true, but the Emperours reſolution to ruine him, had put him upon that courſe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, and that after their reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation no man did ever more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or ſucceſsfully promote the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Service: And laſtly, <hi>Conrards</hi> accuſation of their going about to ſubvert the Laws of <hi>Germany,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts upon himſelf for the unjuſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſt againſt his Brother <hi>Henry</hi> and himſelf, by which they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all they poſſeſt: He gives warning to all the Princes to look to themſelves, and hoped if they did not joyn with him in ſo Juſt a Cauſe, that at leaſt they would approve of his taking Arms for the recovery of his Dutchies from <hi>Conrard,</hi> whom he

            <p>The War then begun by <hi>Henry</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Conrard,</hi> but being intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his death, it was renewed by <hi>Gwelfo,</hi> and kindled ſuch a flame in <hi>Germany,</hi> as rivers of blood could ſcarce quench; the Nation was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betwixt them, though not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for all the Princes that conſented to the forfeiture of the Dutchies of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Saxony</hi> were engaged in honour to aſſiſt <hi>Conrard,</hi> and ſuch as enjoy'd the fruits of it could do no leſs. Some few of the Princes who had declared againſt <hi>Conrards</hi> ſevere proceedings with <hi>Henry,</hi> and the greateſt part of the <hi>Bavarians</hi> did joyn with <hi>Gwelfo:</hi> And what he wanted in <hi>Germany</hi> was made up from abroad, for <hi>Roger</hi> King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi> ſupplied him with vaſt ſums of money, which drew foreign troops to his Service, and four of the Princes of the houſe of <hi>Eſté</hi> raiſed what forces <label type="milestone">

            <p>Some Writers make thoſe famous factions of <hi>Gwelfs</hi> and <hi>Gibellins</hi> which firſt appeared in <hi>Germany,</hi> and for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:93968:61"/>
many ages rent <hi>Italy</hi> to have had their riſe from this War, thoſe who were with the Emperour being called <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellins</hi> from <hi>Giblinga,</hi> the place of <hi>Conrards</hi> Nativity; and the others <hi>Gwelfs</hi> from <hi>Gwelfo,</hi> the head of their Party: And though moſt will have the original of theſe names to be of more ancient date, yet all muſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that they then began to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uſed to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> from the <hi>Bavarians;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the wars of <hi>Italy,</hi> by <hi>Gwelfs</hi> were underſtood ſuch as favoured the Pope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gwelfo</hi>'s Army was in the progreſs of the War ſo weaken'd, that not able to keep the field he went to <hi>Winbergh</hi> whither <hi>Conrard</hi> purſued him, and ſhut him up ſo cloſe, that the beſt terms he could obtain was, that he with his followers ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue priſoners of War, and the place was to be expoſed to ſack; but <hi>Gwelfo</hi>'s Princeſs who was there with her Husband, made it her humble ſute to <hi>Conrard,</hi> that ſhe with the Ladies of her Court might firſt be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to retire without any other bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:93968:62"/>
than what they themſelves could carry; this requeſt being readily granted, they took their Husbands upon their backs, declaring as they paſt through the Camp, that theſe were the only Jewels they deſired to ſecure from <hi>Conrard</hi> and his Army; this generous act of the Princeſs and her Ladies did ſo ſurprize and pleaſe the Emperour, that he would ſee his word made good, and thereupon not only pardon'd but was reconciled to <hi>Gwelfo,</hi> giving him back ſome part of his Brothers inheritance: <hi>Gwelfo</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards accompanied <hi>Conrard</hi> in his expedition to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> which the treachery of the <hi>Greeks</hi> rendered inſucceſsfull; at his return he made ready an Army to go into <hi>Italy</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Imperial Crown, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to carry <hi>Gwelfo</hi> with him, of whoſe company he ſeem'd to be very fond, becauſe he durſt not leave him behind; but his journey being put off by his ſickneſs, he lived not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that honour, and though he left a Son, yet his Nephew <hi>Frederick Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroſſa</hi> ſucceeded him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frederick</hi>'s firſt work was to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:93968:62"/>
all the breaches of <hi>Germany,</hi> which he did with ſo much equity and diſcretion, that he gave ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to all parties. His Mother was of the Houſe of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and this made him willing to reſtore that Dutchy to the Son of <hi>Henry,</hi> and to his Uncle <hi>Gwelfo</hi> he gave all that the Emperours had recovered of <hi>Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis</hi> Eſtate; which I confeſs was a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right in ſome meaſure to the houſe of <hi>Eſté,</hi> but not to that part of it that had ſuffered moſt by her.</p>
            <p>This brings us back to <hi>Italy,</hi> which we ſhall now find the chief Scene of Affairs, and <hi>Rinaldus</hi> of <hi>Eſté</hi> of age to be the chief Actor, for whoſe ſake we muſt give a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of things, as they then ſtood when <hi>Frederick</hi> came thither.</p>
            <p>The long abſence of an Emperour had brought Affairs into great diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, eſpecially in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> where every City form'd it ſelf into a ſort of Republick; and diſſenſions naturally ariſing betwixt them, there was no perſon that had either Authority to determine their differences, or power to ſee his determinations received.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:93968:63"/>
The City of <hi>Milan</hi> affected the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over all the reſt, had already made ſome ſubmit, and was every day encroaching upon others with an inſupportable inſolence. Many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were brought to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour from moſt of the neighbour Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, declaring, that they muſt ſubmit to the Queen of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> for ſo <hi>Milan</hi> ſtiled her ſelf, unleſs they had his protection. The Emperour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to make what haſt he could to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and to put an end to all their quarrels. When he came to the <hi>Lago di Garda</hi> near <hi>Verona,</hi> he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the complements of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes; amongſt others were <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, Fulco, Opizo</hi> and <hi>Albertus</hi> of <hi>Eſté</hi> his Kinſmen by his Mother who had all conferred on them ſpecial marks of his favour: But we find nothing of <hi>Rinaldus</hi> the Chief of the Family, who it is thought abſented himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing highly diſguſted that <hi>Matildis</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſhould be ſetled by <hi>Frederick</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>German</hi> Line. The Emperour having rebuked thoſe of <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Tortona</hi> for their late carriage, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them to make reparation for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93968:63"/>
the injuries done their neighbours, went towards <hi>Rome,</hi> and being <label type="milestone">

            </p>
            <p>Freſh troubles in <hi>Italy</hi> called him ſoon back, but as his preſence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted all their Rebellion into Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Duty; ſo his being reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon too eaſie terms to <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Breſcia,</hi> the authors of diſcord encouraged them to renew their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices when he was gone; and for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian</hi> if we honour him for his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as being of our neighbour-nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>England,</hi> we muſt condemn him for his malice againſt this great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour in fomenting their Rebellion. When <hi>Frederick</hi> came to <hi>Italy</hi> the third time, <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Breſcia</hi> had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Towns joyn'd to them, and ſtood out a long ſiege; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he left them, they were made to accept of what conditions he pleaſed to impoſe, which yet were much more gentle than they, eſpecially <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> did deſerve, after having twice abuſed his clemency.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Adrian</hi> the fourth dying, the Election of two Popes,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93968:64"/>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, and <hi>Victor</hi> the fourth occaſioned a new Schiſm more dangerous than any of the former: both writ to the Emperour then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging <hi>Crema,</hi> to confirm their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but he out of pure zeal for the peace of the Church refuſing to declare for either, called a Council at <hi>Pavia,</hi> where they were ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to appear to have their Cauſe heard and determined by their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Biſhops. <hi>Victor</hi> came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the day appointed, but <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> continued at <hi>Rome;</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Council offended at his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and judging his not appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to flow from a diffidence in his Cauſe, gave it in favour of <hi>Victor,</hi> whom the Emperour did then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and ſent Letters to the Kings of <hi>France, England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> to give an account of what was there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alexander</hi> was excommunicated by <hi>Victor</hi> at <hi>Pavia, Frederick</hi> and <hi>Victor</hi> by <hi>Alexander</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties being now irreconcilable, <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> ſent a Legat to thoſe of <hi>Milan</hi> to declare them abſolved from the

Oaths they had lately ſworn, and not obliged to make good the Articles which neceſſity had extorted from them. <hi>Milan</hi> and the Confederate Cities took Arms immediately, and reſolving to carry on a formed War againſt the Emperour, invited <hi>Rinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Eſté</hi> to be their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who thinking himſelf injured and neglected by <hi>Frederick,</hi> did too readily undertake the Patronage of ſo unjuſt a Cauſe.</p>
            <p>The Emperour judging his Army too weak to deal with ſo many, gave order for New Levies in <hi>Germany,</hi> which were finiſhed, and ſent with great expedition to <hi>Italy,</hi> the Kings likewiſe of <hi>Bohemia, Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway</hi> came in perſon to his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with their choiceſt troops, ſo that when all his forces were united he had no leſs than ſeventy thouſand Foot, and forty thouſand Horſe; the Confederates likewiſe had made great preparations, <hi>Rinaldus</hi> of <hi>Eſté</hi> their General brought ſix thouſand Foot, and four thouſand Horſe, <hi>Breſcia, Bergamo Piacenza, Verona, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza, Padoua</hi> and <hi>Bologna,</hi> ſent the

            <p>
               <hi>Rinaldus</hi> perceiving the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Army to dwindle away inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, partly by Famine, and partly by Sickneſs, occaſion'd by their being ſhut up ſo cloſe in the hotteſt ſeaſon of the year, called a Council of War, where it was reſolved, That all ſhould be in readineſs next morning to bring the buſineſs to an iſſue; the whole Army being accordingly aſſembled in the great Market place, <hi>Rinaldus</hi> led them out into the Imperial Camp a little before noon, where falling in upon the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Norvegians</hi> that were ſecure and unfit for action, by reaſon of the great heat, he did ſo great execution, that no perſwaſion could make them continue the ſiege
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:93968:65"/>
longer, and their marching off did ſo diſhearten the reſt, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour thought beſt to follow them; <hi>Rinaldus</hi> purſued him in his retreat, but the Emperour not able to bear this affront, and conſidering his Army to be ſtill the more numerous, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him battle; <hi>Rinaldus</hi> to make up the diſproportion in the number by the advantage of the ground, poſted himſelf upon a hill, dividing his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into four parts; he gave the Van towards the plain to his Son <hi>Azo</hi> and <hi>Torriſedi</hi> Governour of <hi>Verona,</hi> the <hi>Milan</hi> Troops were placed at ſome diſtance behind, thoſe of <hi>Bergamo, Breſcia</hi> and <hi>Piacenza</hi> had the top of the hill, and the General himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to the other ſide out of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies view.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> commanded one Wing of the Imperial Army, the Kings of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; <hi>Frederick</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſtood in the middle.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Bohemia</hi>'s Wing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the fight about noon with <hi>Azo</hi> and <hi>Torriſedi,</hi> and for a long time it was doubtfull to which Party victory
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93968:66"/>
enclined, till the King being wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and carried back to the Camp half dead, his men retired in diſorder: <hi>Azo</hi> encouraged by this, and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Troops of <hi>Milan,</hi> bore all down before him till he came to the main Body, where the Emperour with his <hi>German</hi> Horſe ſuſtained his charge, killed thoſe who led the Troops of <hi>Milan,</hi> and took <hi>Azo</hi> priſoner. They upon the top of the hill who hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to had no occaſion to act, ſeeing the reſt in diſtreſs marched briskly down to their aſſiſtance; and while the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts bent their Forces that way, thinking the whole Confederate Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was now engaged, <hi>Rinaldus</hi> came with ſuch violence upon their Rere, that they preſently gave ground and marched off, with his own hand he took the Imperial Standard, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the Emperour ſo cloſe, that he was obliged to the darkneſs of the night for his eſcape; but the news of his Sons being carried off priſoner did much abate the joy of his ſucceſs; nor could any arguments prevail on the Emperour to give him up ſo long as his Father lived. It is believed, if
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93968:66"/>
this advantage had been purſued, the Emperours Affairs in <hi>Italy</hi> might ſoon have been brought to a weak paſs; but the Confederate Troops, as if they had already done enough, went all home to their own Cities to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the applauſe and carreſſes of their friends, and could never again be united. <hi>Rinaldus</hi> alſo gave up his Commiſſion, not willing to exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Emperour while he had ſuch an Hoſtage from his Family; nor could the Emperour make ſure any other wayes of one who did ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly head the Confederates, that had ſo often violated their Duty, and failed in their promiſes to their Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frederick</hi> had been alwayes hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Victorious, and now his Fortune ſeemed to decline, having after this manner beſieged <hi>Milan</hi> ſeveral months to little purpoſe, and at laſt retired with ſo great loſs; but this blow did rather haſten his ſucceſs, for being doubtfull what courſe to take, the news was brought him of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates being gone, and this encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged him to return to the ſiege of

               <hi>Milan</hi> ſooner than they expected; the City ſeeing it ſelf abandon'd ſent to capitulate with the Emperour, but he abſolutely refuſed to agree to any terms, telling them that he expected to enter at a breach in their Walls as a Conquerour, and to treat them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; whereupon truſting to his Clemency their Gates were opened; the Emperour then mindfull how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſly they had dealt with him, commanded all the Inhabitants to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part within three dayes, and the City to be razed to the ground; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fourth day after, he entered at a breach with his whole Army to ſee his Sentence put in execution; the neighbour Cities were forward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to revenge the injuries recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in pulling down each a part; the wretched Inhabitants ſtanding without the Walls to expreſs their ſorrow in cryes and tears when they ſaw the deplorable fall of the City: <hi>Novara</hi> pull'd down one quarter, <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona</hi> another, <hi>Como</hi> a third, and <hi>Lode</hi> a fourth, Churches and Convents, Hoſpitals and Palaces, without reſpect <label type="milestone">

two ſmall Chappels of all that ſtately City was left ſtanding; the very Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio or great Market-place was ſow'd with Salt: And thus <hi>Milan</hi> which had long aſpired to the Soveraignty of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and which for its large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, its beauty, and the number as well as riches of its Citizens began to emulate <hi>Rome,</hi> felt in a few dayes this terrible deſolation, as a juſt reward of its inſolence to its Neighbours, and of its perfidy to an indulgent Prince, who had already three ſeveral times pardon'd its rebellion.</p>
            <p>The deſtruction of <hi>Milan,</hi> the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all the other Cities, and the changing the Ancient Magiſtrates into Imperial <hi>Podeſta</hi>'s ſeem'd to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Peace of <hi>Italy</hi> for many years: Yet the haughty carriage of theſe new Miniſters in the Emperours abſence, and the Arts of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> drew on in a ſhort time a freſh Rebellion: they wanted only a Head, and knew by former experience, that none could either do them credit or ſervice like <hi>Rinaldus,</hi> but his tenderneſs for his Son was ſuch, that no perſwaſions could engage him again.</p>
            <p>

If <hi>Rinaldus</hi> of <hi>Eſté</hi>'s denying to joyn with the Confederates, did at firſt retard their motions, the baſeneſs of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> one of the ſame Family did afterwards ſpoil the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Affairs, when he was in a fair way to reduce all; he was the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Couſin, and had been reſtored to the greateſt part of his Fathers Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions at the ſame time that his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <hi>Guelpho</hi> had thoſe of <hi>Matildis</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in <hi>Italy:</hi> Yet upon a vain ſcruple ariſing from <hi>Alexanders</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication he left him when he had moſt occaſion for him and his Troops. The Emperour went after him to perſwade him to return, but no arguments nor condeſcenſion in the Emperour could work upon an obſtinate humour, cloak'd with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to conſcience: Nor was it only the loſs of him and his followers, for his example was like to draw others away; ſo that the Emperour percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ill diſpoſition of his Army infected by the very air of that rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Countrey, ſent to <hi>Alexander</hi> to procure his reconciliation; this he obtained indeed, but upon ſuch terms,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:93968:68"/>
that it is hard to ſay, whether <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the third, or <hi>Gregory</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth treated an Emperour with moſt inſolence; what <hi>Gregory</hi> did at the Caſtle of <hi>Cannoſſa</hi> only with <hi>Matil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, Alexander</hi> may be ſaid to have done ſolemnly in the face of the whole Senate and people of <hi>Venice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperour finding his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſo little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, turn'd him out of all, and <hi>Henry</hi> who had married a Daughter of <hi>England,</hi> fled thither for protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where he ſtay'd, till by that Kings interceſſion the Dutchies of <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> and <hi>Lunenburgh</hi> were reſtored to him by the Emperour; in this his former greatneſs was indeed much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired, yet ſtill he continued in the firſt rank of <hi>German</hi> Princes, which figure his ſucceſſors have ever ſince ſuſtained to the great honour of the Family of <hi>Eſté</hi> from which they are ſprung.</p>
            <p>Two years before died <hi>Rinaldus</hi> the moſt popular Prince, and the greateſt General of the <hi>Italian</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <label type="milestone">

together, and he had been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull in all his undertakings, but the badneſs of the Cauſe he all along eſpouſed did much leſſen the glory of his actions. The latter part of his life affords nothing remarkable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the taking <hi>Rovigo,</hi> becauſe the Emperour knowing his reſtleſs ſpirit, would never part with his Son, by whoſe confinement he was ſure to bind <hi>Rinaldus</hi> to his good behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
            <p>When the Emperour had the news of <hi>Rinaldus</hi>'s death, he call'd to him <hi>Azo,</hi> ſhew'd him how much his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had been his Enemy, how ill <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> had requited his favours, and how both being his near Kinſmen had been conſequently moſt of all perſons obliged to promote his ſervice and honour: Yet that the former had been a great Inſtrument in the Rebellion of <hi>Milan,</hi> the latter of his unſeaſonable accommodation with the Pope; but that the world might ſee he had no deſign to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy their Family, nor to revenge the Fathers guilt upon the Son from whom better returns might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:93968:69"/>
he freely diſmiſt him, that he might go and enjoy what <hi>Rinaldus</hi> had left, adding thereunto the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Milan</hi> granted formerly by <hi>Otho</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> to his Anceſtor <hi>Hugo. Azo</hi>'s unexpected advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gave great joy to thoſe who wiſh'd well to his Houſe, but he died before he could expreſs his ſenſe of the Emperours Generoſity, and left this as a debt upon his Couſin <hi>Opizo</hi> who ſucceeded him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Opizo</hi>'s riſe did beget great emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the breaſts of two powerfull Neighbours, and the moſt dangerous Enemies the Family of <hi>Eſté</hi> ever dealt with, <hi>Salinguerra Taurellus</hi> of <hi>Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> and <hi>Actiolinus</hi> of <hi>Onara,</hi> who had married <hi>Rinaldus</hi>'s Daughter: the former was a man of extraordinary parts, the latter a ſtout Captain, and both of them were enflam'd with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, which <hi>Opizo</hi>'s greatneſs ſeem'd to check; <hi>Salinguerra</hi> poſſeſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Ferrara</hi> with an Opinion that the Marqueſs of <hi>Eſté</hi> deſign'd their ruine, whereupon they came to acts of hoſtility with his Subjects without further examining the buſineſs. <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiolinus</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>German</hi> Factions began in <hi>Italy</hi> during <hi>Frederick</hi>'s War with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the third, and were by the ſowers of Sedition improved to that degree under <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſecond, that they divided the whole Nation, they put all the Families at variance with one another, and the Cities in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Civil Wars within themſelves; and if any were indifferent in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for their own ſecurity they were forced to declare themſelves of either Party. Sometimes one Brother would be a <hi>Gibellin,</hi> that is, for the Emperour, and the other a <hi>Guelph</hi> for the Pope; and thereupon forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the tyes of Nature, would mortally hate and perſecute one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; robberies, aſſaſſinations, and all ſorts of violence and revenge were allow'd againſt thoſe of the contrary Faction: and the breach being once
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:93968:71"/>
made was too like to continue, ſeeing the wayes of uniting them were cut off, no man could expect reparation by Juſtice which lay dead; and the Families of one Faction could hardly be perſwaded to match with thoſe of the other: Their publick meetings did for the moſt part end in quarrels, and in the ſtreets they uſed to point at one another as Traytors or Rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadoes. Nor was the long duration leſs ſtrange than the violence of theſe Factions, for though the flame did not always burn with equal fury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſometimes ſtifled ſeveral years, and then breaking out again; yet it laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed almoſt four hundred years (from <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa</hi>'s time till the Reign of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth) before it was quite extinct. Upon ſtrict en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry I find the better ſort can ſtill tell which Families were <hi>Guelphs,</hi> and which <hi>Gibellins</hi> in ſeveral places, but they have now laid aſide all rancour or malice upon this ſcore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Actiolinus</hi> was now grown a very nneaſie Neighbour: with an Army of <hi>Padouans</hi> he went towards <hi>Vicenza</hi> and <hi>Verona,</hi> pillaging and burning all
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93968:71"/>
where he came, the People of <hi>Verona</hi> did in this ſtrait caſt their eyes upon <hi>Azo Opizo</hi>'s Son, who with ſuch as follow'd him from <hi>Ferrara</hi> and <hi>Eſté</hi> fought <hi>Actiolin</hi> near <hi>Bachilio,</hi> and took five hundred of his Party priſoners. It is probable <hi>Azo</hi> was chiefly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in this ſervice, becauſe <hi>Opizo</hi> did then lie ill, and died a few dayes after.</p>
            <p>This early proof of <hi>Azo</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venths valour ſeem'd to preſage great happineſs under his Government, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1193</label> which made them receive him at <hi>Eſté</hi> upon his return with extraordinary expreſſions of joy; and there he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſome time till his friends at <hi>Ferrara</hi> troubled to loſe the only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that could curb <hi>Salinguerra,</hi> found a charm to bring him back. His Wife the Count of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Daughter, by whom he had ſeveral Children, was lately dead; they therefore propoſed to him a match with a Lady of their City, who for riches and intereſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, all that liv'd in thoſe parts; her Uncle was the Chief Magiſtrate, and the much richeſt Nobleman of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who beſides what he had

there, was alſo Hereditary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Ancona,</hi> to all which having no Iſſue, his Niece was to ſucceed. This was too advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous a proffer for <hi>Azo</hi> to neglect, and <hi>Salinguerra</hi>'s endeavouring to hinder it, did bring it on the ſooner; they were married privately, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards received by the Magiſtrates and People of <hi>Ferrara</hi> at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thither, with all the formalities of Princes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salinguerra</hi> highly enraged went to the Emperour who was then in <hi>Sicily,</hi> with heavy Articles againſt <hi>Azo;</hi> firſt, that he deſign'd to make himſelf ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Maſter of all the Cities near him, as he had already done of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> and that with his ambition he diſcovered a hatred to the Emperour and his Government: Secondly, that he could not forbear to expreſs his reſentment of their Families having loſt the Dutchies of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Saxony;</hi> and thirdly, that of all his Anceſtors he did moſt extol <hi>Rinaldus,</hi> whom it was plain he intended to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate by making himſelf Head of the <hi>Guelphs</hi> his Majeſties profeſſed

enemies. Theſe words of <hi>Salinguerra,</hi> ſet out with all the advantage of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, of which he was a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, did ſo work upon <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, that it was thought, if he had liv'd to come back it would have gone ill with <hi>Azo.</hi>

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Crown was not well ſetled upon <hi>Otho</hi>'s head when <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the third gave it away to <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> the ſecond, pretending that <hi>Otho</hi> had broke his Coronation Oath, and forfeited his Dignity by invading the Dominions of <hi>Frederick,</hi> and of the Church: Whether the Pope were more injuſt in ſetting <hi>Otho</hi> up to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Philip,</hi> or in degrading him now to advance <hi>Frederick,</hi> whom he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had formerly injured, I leave to others to decide. But plain it is, that no Apology can be made for <hi>Azo</hi>'s behaviour in this juncture, ſeeing he who had ſo lately been own'd for <hi>Otho</hi>'s Kinſman, and had received ſo freſh marks of his favour, was the moſt forward of all the Nobility of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93968:74"/>
               <hi>Lombardy</hi> to countenance the Popes ſentence, and declare for <hi>Frederick.</hi> By his means were <hi>Otho</hi>'s Garriſons turned out of moſt of the Cities of <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> and ſo great was his zeal for the Cauſe, and ſo entirely did the party confide in him, that he had the young Prince committed to his truſt till he got ſafe into <hi>Germany:</hi> This rendered him ſtill more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable among the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> who were become too ſtrong for the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by <hi>Otho</hi>'s depreſſion; but while they were projecting how to model the Government of <hi>Lombardy</hi> after their own way, <hi>Azo</hi>'s death broke all their meaſures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salinguerra</hi> hoping to find in his Son <hi>Aldobrandinus</hi> a perſon eaſie to deal with, would not ſtand to the treaty made with <hi>Azo</hi> a little before his death, complaining that he had been over-reached in it; beſides, he conſidered, if the Marqueſs once got <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Regio</hi> into his hands, as he was like to do, with what grief he muſt from the Walls of <hi>Ferrara</hi> ſee himſelf ſurrounded on every ſide with the Territories of the Houſe of

               <hi>Eſté,</hi> and therefore made what haſt he could to come to a breach before he were in a manner ſhut up at home. Notice being given to the Marqueſs of <hi>Salinguerra</hi>'s intentions, he ſent to <hi>Bologna</hi> the guaranty of the Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betwixt <hi>Salinguerra</hi> and his Father, to demand their aſſiſtance; they who knew <hi>Salinguerra</hi> to be a man of a reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs temper, that obſerv'd no agreement longer than it made for his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, joyned with the Marqueſs, and marched towards <hi>Ferrara,</hi> which they took without great reſiſtance; and <hi>Salinguerra</hi> retired to a Caſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to <hi>Modena,</hi> from whence by frequent excurſions he did greatly annoy the other Party; but percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them reſolved to have the place, he engaged <hi>Bologna</hi> to intercede with the Marqueſs, that upon ſurrender he might have leave to return to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> with ſolemn proteſtations, that he would give him no further diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance.</p>
            <p>The difference with <hi>Salinguerra</hi> was the ſooner made up, becauſe the danger <hi>Eſté</hi> was in by <hi>Actiolin</hi> and the <hi>Padouans</hi> called for ſpeedy relief

The firſt thing he did after quelling an Inſurrection in <hi>Ancona,</hi> was to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> that ſo he might have an eye upon <hi>Salinguerra</hi>'s motions, whom he knew ready to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of every change, and <hi>Salinguer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> Opinion of <hi>Azo</hi> kept them ſeveral years on good terms; but the flame that was ſmother'd and not extinct, did too eaſily break out again; and now all began to declare themſelves openly <hi>Guelphs</hi> or <hi>Gibellins. Salin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerra</hi> being gone Podeſtá to <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toua,</hi> the <hi>Guelphs</hi> in a popular tumult pulled down his Pallace, deſtroy'd his fine Gardens, broke his Statues in pieces, and made havock of every thing they met with. This news did ſo incenſe him, that coming upon them unexpected, he killed every <hi>Guelph</hi> he found, and by the help of the <hi>Gibellins</hi> forced the Marqueſs to leave the City to his mercy. This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War which none can deny <hi>Azo</hi>'s Party began, did for three years plague <hi>Ferrara;</hi> ſometimes the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs and the <hi>Guelphs</hi> had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſometimes none were to be ſeen but <hi>Gibellins;</hi> thoſe that prevailed
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93968:77"/>
were ſure to pull down all the good houſes that belonged to the other Party; ſo that at laſt the City lay in a heap of rubbiſh, and of thirty two Steeples that were in it when <hi>Salin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerra</hi> went to <hi>Mantoua,</hi> not one was left ſtanding.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs aſſiſted by <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Padoua</hi> ſhut <hi>Salinguerra</hi> ſo cloſe up within <hi>Ferrara,</hi> that he ſeemed willing to come to any accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but when Count <hi>Boniface</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Invitation went in to treat with him, moſt perfidiouſly he kept him priſoner, telling him withall, that as <hi>Azo</hi> was obliged to the Troops of <hi>Verona</hi> for the advantage he now had, ſo he expected his own terms before he parted with him. <hi>Azo</hi>'s tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Count <hi>Boniface</hi> whom he judged in great danger, made him yield to ſuch things as <hi>Salinguerra</hi> durſt never otherwiſe have propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; for it was agreed, that all the <hi>Gibellins</hi> baniſhed by the Marqueſs as well as the <hi>Guelphs</hi> by <hi>Salinguerra,</hi> ſhould have leave to return, and be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain poſſeſt of their Eſtates, and of the grounds where their houſes had ſtood,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93968:78"/>
for very few of them were left entire, that all places and truſts ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided betwixt them, that <hi>Salinguerra</hi> ſhould continue at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> but the Marqueſs might not come thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove twice a year, and then he was to leave moſt of his train without the Gates, and to ſtay only a few dayes. This Peace beyond all mens expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laſted fifteen years, which help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much to repair the ruines of the City.</p>
            <p>About this time <hi>Actiolinus,</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared head of the <hi>Gibellins,</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving long glutted himſelf with blood, cruelty and oppreſſion, renounced the world to dedicate the ruines of his old age to a Monaſtick life, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Son of the ſame name, who carried on the diviſions of <hi>Italy,</hi> and <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1226</label> out-vied him in all manner of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. <hi>Salinguerra</hi> could not expect to better himſelf by falling out again with the Marqueſs; yet that he might one day or other make work for him, he underhand employed all his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to get <hi>Actiolin</hi> the younger crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Podeſtá of <hi>Verona,</hi> by which that Party was much ſtrengthen'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:93968:78"/>
If things went ill with the <hi>Guelphs</hi> where <hi>Actiolinus</hi> and <hi>Salinguerra</hi> were in Authority, the <hi>Gibellins</hi> made as great complaints of their hard uſage in <hi>Ancona,</hi> where the Marqueſs being abſolute Maſter, was much encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his ſeverities by <hi>Honorius</hi> the third, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth; the latter ſeeing <hi>Frederick</hi> engaged in the Holy War thought to ſeize upon the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his Deſign to <hi>Azo,</hi> found him too ready to engage in it; nor could any thing but the Emperours ſpeedy return have prevented them.</p>
            <p>No wonder if <hi>Frederick</hi> were much offended with the Pope and <hi>Azo</hi>'s proceedings, and they conſcious of their guilt armed the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> leſt the Emperour ſhould attempt any thing againſt them, which made <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiolinus</hi> and his Party not think themſelves ſecure, unleſs they were in the ſame poſture; ſo that for a long time in form'd Armies they lay in wait for one another, and put a ſtop not only to all manner of Trade, which much impoveriſhed Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but alſo to agriculture, upon
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:93968:79"/>
which a Famine was like to enſue: Both Parties being at length tired out, and their brutal fury in ſome meaſure ſpent, firſt a ceſſation of Arms, then a Peace was concluded and ſealed with the marriage of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiolins</hi> Niece to <hi>Rinaldus Azo</hi>'s Son.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Andrew</hi> the ſecond of <hi>Hungary</hi> in his return from <hi>Rome</hi> was entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Azo</hi> at <hi>Eſté,</hi> where charmed with the beauty of <hi>Beatrix, Aldobran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi>'s Daughter, and her Uncles Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, he demanded her in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and <hi>Azo</hi> conſenting to it, ſhe was ſent after him into <hi>Hungary</hi> with a Noble Train; a few months after <hi>Andrew</hi> died leaving the Queen with Child, and ſhe apprehending her ſelf in danger from the next Heir of the Crown, retired to her Friends in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> where ſhe was brought to bed of <label type="milestone">

            <p>The Peace betwixt <hi>Azo</hi> and <hi>Actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi> at beſt ſignified little, ſeeing their acts of hoſtility were ſcarce ever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued; but <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93968:79"/>
taking occaſion to quarrel with the Emperour for refuſing to go again into <hi>Syria,</hi> brought things to a worſe paſs than before: they had drawn the <hi>Guelphs</hi> and <hi>Gibellins</hi> into bodies, openly defying one another; the Emperour upon his Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was marching towards <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Salinguerra</hi> was entering upon the laſt and moſt Tragical Act of his Life, which I muſt not paſs in ſilence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> required a certain acknowledgement for all goods car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried up the <hi>Pó</hi> to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> which <hi>Salinguerra</hi> was not willing to pay; and their ſhips being ſent to lye at the mouth of the River to hinder any thing to enter, <hi>Salinguerra</hi> with what Boats he could make came upon them, and after a ſharp diſpute had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, taking ſome, which he brought to <hi>Ferrara</hi> as Trophies of his Victory over the <hi>Venetian</hi> Navy. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick not able to digeſt this affront, joyned with the <hi>Guelphs</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged upon <hi>Salinguerra,</hi> who ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting ſome deſign upon the City did haſten his ruine by command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all of that Faction to be gone,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93968:80"/>
and receiving <hi>Germans</hi> in their place.</p>
            <p>This was declared to be a plain breach of the Treaty with <hi>Azo,</hi> who thereupon being choſen General a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, went towards <hi>Ferrara</hi> in the beginning of <hi>February,</hi> accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by the Dogé of <hi>Venice,</hi> the Popes Legate <hi>Boniface,</hi> and many of the Chief Nobility of thoſe parts; <hi>Salin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerra</hi> made for four months a ſtout reſiſtance, till Proviſions beginning to fail, without any proſpect of ſupply, the Land Army having deſtroyed the Harveſt; the <hi>Venetian</hi> Navy block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the River, and the <hi>Germans</hi> growing mutinous, <hi>Hugo Rambertus,</hi> a man of great Authority, did in the name of the City deſire him to make peace with <hi>Azo. Salinguerra</hi> had no diſpoſition towards it, yet yielded to <hi>Hugo</hi>'s importunity, and upon the Generals, the Dogés and the Legates promiſe, that he ſhould be permitted to return ſafe into the City, ventured out into the Enemies Camp to treat.</p>
            <p>The Legate was for ſeizing imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon <hi>Salinguerra,</hi> pretending that no faith was to be kept to one
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:93968:80"/>
that had broken his ſo often, but the Marqueſs would by no means agree to it, at laſt it was concerted among them, that leaving the General in the Camp with the Army, the reſt ſhould accompany him ſafe into the Town to make good their word, and there make him priſoner; and while <hi>Salin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guerra</hi> entertained them at a ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Banquet he was laid hold upon, clap'd in chains, and ſent in a Galley to <hi>Venice,</hi> where he died ſoon after in the eightieth year of his age. This we muſt ſay of <hi>Salinguerra,</hi> that no man ever took more pains to bring trouble upon himſelf, nor uſed greater addreſs to be diſ-intangled: Moſt of his actions ſhew how little he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to Fortune, though much to Nature, being of a gracefull perſon, affable, bold, eloquent and bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, all which helped to make him popular; but thoſe bleſſings were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verballanced by cruelty, diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ambition; that at laſt he had hard meaſure cannot be denied; yet his treacherous carriage to others made his fall the leſs pitied.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Salinguerra</hi>'s death brought the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93968:81"/>
Marqueſs a ſufficient reward for all the pains and danger undergon in behalf of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> the whole City in a body, with the Biſhop, declaring him their Prince, to whom they were willing to commit their Lives and Fortunes, without tying him to any other Rules of Government than what his Prudence and Goodneſs ſhould judge moſt for the Cities ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The <hi>Venetians</hi> for the charge and trouble they had been at in this Expedition, were allowed to ſettle a Magiſtrate there, whoſe Authority in all their Councils was for ſome time great, but after a few years limited by the Marqueſs to ſuch things as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concerned the Republick. The Popes Legate alſo took upon him to confirm in his Maſters Name the Cities choice of the Marqueſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which at firſt appeared no more than a matter of Ceremony, but was ſtrangely made uſe of afterwards to prove the Popes Title to that City. This <hi>Azo</hi>'s Succeſſors found by ſad experience, when allowed only to be feudatary Princes, they were at laſt forced to part with that to the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93968:81"/>
Church, which they owed to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Free Choice; and in truth it was a high piece of injuſtice, by them called ſubtilty, for the Pope to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to give away what was not his own, that ſo he might call it back at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Actiolin</hi> had with grief beheld the fall of <hi>Salinguerra,</hi> and the ruine of his Party in <hi>Ferrara,</hi> by the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Marqueſs, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented as long as he could, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only for an occaſion to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, which alwayes comes too ſoon. <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth, <hi>Azo</hi>'s beſt friend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead, the Emperours Arms threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> and the Marqueſs being employed at <hi>Ferrara, Actiolin</hi> upon a ſudden falls into his Countries of <hi>Eſté</hi> and <hi>Rovigo,</hi> made prey of whatever was worth carrying away, burnt the reſt with the villages, and killed without reſpect to ſex or age, all the perſons he met with, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Padoua</hi> which had for ſome time groan'd under his yoke. The Marqueſs with his Army went thither and ſate down before it, knowing how much <hi>Actiolin</hi> was hated; but
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93968:82"/>
this coſt many of the <hi>Padouan</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity dear; for being ſuſpected to have encouraged the Marqueſs in this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, without further proof, they were by the Tyrants order moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly murdered.

               <hi>Conrard</hi> after the death of the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> cauſed ſome to poiſon <hi>Rinaldus Azo</hi>'s Son, who had been many years kept priſoner in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> but his Son <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pizo</hi> eſcaped to his Grand-Father with the news of <hi>Rinaldus</hi>'s death.

deal thus with the Son of his greateſt Enemy, if it be true which is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he helped to diſpatch the Emperour his Father; and this may in a great part excuſe his Brother <hi>Manfred</hi> for poiſoning him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manfred</hi> did Arm mightily in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and encouraged <hi>Actiolin</hi> to do the ſame in <hi>Lombardy:</hi> his Neighbours to whom he was grown terrible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other Army than his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant train, knew what they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, if the <hi>Gibellins</hi> were brought together under ſuch a General; this made the <hi>Venetians,</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <label type="milestone">

the loſs of Eſtate, was thought no ſmall favour, for by this means life was ſecured, which no innocence could do at home; his fury often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times broke out againſt thoſe who thought themſelves moſt his favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, and who had really deſerved beſt of him: In a word, all within his reach, and he had then a long arm, did tremble under the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his wrath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Actiolin</hi> upon the news of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates march, and of their deſign upon <hi>Padoua,</hi> not willing to meet them, nor judging it for his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be beſieged there, left the place with a good Garriſon to his Nephew, and went in perſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Mantoua,</hi> as if he had appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended no danger behind him; but this act of vanity loſt him <hi>Padoua,</hi> which having made a ſhort and a faint reſiſtance was taken by aſſault: Moſt of the Inhabitants, inſtead of ſeeking for lurking places, as is uſual upon ſuch occaſions, run to meet the Marqueſs and Legate at their entry, falling down at their feet, ready to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore them, as ſent from God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93968:83"/>
their City from ſo horrid a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and then walking before in a Solemn Proceſſion to the Great Church, with a good heart they ſung <hi>Te Deum.</hi> From the Church they went to the priſons, freeing fifteen hundred from their chains in one place, ſix hundred in another, beſides many Women of quality, who had not ſeen the light, nor their friends, nor known how things went in the world for ſeveral years. Upon the ſurrender of the Caſtle, the whole City run to ſee that place of which next to hell they were moſt afraid, it having been of a long time the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Theatre of <hi>Actiolins</hi> cruelty: Upon ſearch, in the Dungeons above four hundred and ſixty perſons were found ſo pined away with hunger, and covered with filth, that none pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent could know them, either by their voices or countenances, though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards moſt of them proved to be <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>douans.</hi> The great number and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Inſtruments of torment, with the heaps of dead bodies that filled the corners of thoſe loathſom apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, did ſtrike the beholders with
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93968:84"/>
amazement. And indeed as other great Men delight in ſtately Palaces, and fine Gardens, <hi>Actiolin</hi>'s whole ſtudy was employed in thoſe helliſh Inventions; his priſon was a Labe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth in which he commanded the perſon who preſented him the Model to be ſhut firſt up to ſee if it were ſo ingeniouſly contrived as he pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it is certain, as many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ended their dayes in it, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the unhappy contriver, nor any other ever found the way out, to come and give the world an account of it, till the Marqueſs and the Legate got thither.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Padoua</hi> was expreſſing its joy for ſo unexpected a deliverance, it went ill with the poor <hi>Padouans</hi> at <hi>Verona, Actiolin</hi> happened to arrive from the ſiege of <hi>Mantoua</hi> at the ſame time with this unwelcom news; and the poor Meſſenger who innocently reported it was by his order immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately put to death; but it being in a few hours confirmed by many of his Officers who had made their eſcape, <hi>Actiolin</hi> commanded his Army to be lodged within the City, and the Gates
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93968:84"/>
to be ſhut up, and all the <hi>Padouans</hi> who were there, either under confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or ſoldiers in the Army, or Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of his Houſe to be apprehended and killed; and ſo punctually was he obeyed by his Guards, and the other Miniſters of his Cruelty, that in a weeks time, of eleven thouſand only twenty eight remained alive.</p>
            <p>Having offered up ſuch a bloody ſacrifice to his wrath, as hardly any Hiſtory can parallel, he marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Padoua,</hi> but finding it was not to be recovered at his return to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,</hi> thoſe twenty eight, whom in regard of the ſingular ſervices done him, he had formerly exempted from the common butchery, were all hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Market place. Then joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Pallavicino</hi> and ſome other <hi>Gibellins,</hi> he beat the Legates Army, took himſelf priſoner, and got into <hi>Breſcia</hi> almoſt upon as eaſie terms as the Marqueſs and the Legate had <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doua:</hi> But his allowing no ſhare in the Conqueſt to thoſe who aſſiſted him, made <hi>Pallavicino</hi> go over to the Marqueſs for whom the honour of ruining <hi>Actiolin</hi> was reſerved; for
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93968:85"/>
while he was attempting no leſs than the Conqueſt of <hi>Milan,</hi> the Marqueſs and <hi>Pallavicino</hi> gave him battle, and having the advantage, they ſo pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued it, that <hi>Actiolin</hi> with five horſe only endeavouring to recover <hi>Berga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> was over-taken before he got thither, and ſo fell into their hands alive.</p>
            <p>When the Soldiers heard <hi>Actiolin</hi> was taken, they crowded to behold the Monſter, whom they fancied not to be ſhaped like other men, it being a conſtant tradition among the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, that a Devil cloathed with a body, ſupplied his pretended Fathers place when he was begotten; many of them calling to mind, how much he had made them ſuffer in their perſons, in their eſtates, or in their friends, could ſcarce by the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals Authority be contained from offering him violence: but he being recommended to <hi>Pallavicino</hi>'s care he was convey'd firſt to his tent, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to <hi>Soncino,</hi> where giving lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſign of ſorrow for the rivers of innocent blood he had ſplit, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately refuſing to have his wounds

            <p>The joy for <hi>Actiolin</hi>'s death was ſoon allay'd by the actions of <hi>Alberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> his Brother in whom he ſeemed ſtill to live.

            </argument>
            <p>THe loſs of <hi>Actiolin</hi> to the <hi>Gibel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi> was repaired in <hi>Maſtinus Scaliger,</hi> who coming to be Created Podeſtá of <hi>Verona,</hi> declared himſelf head of that Party; Moſt of the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Writers make <hi>Maſtinus</hi> of a very mean extraction, raiſed to great riches under <hi>Actiolin,</hi> and now to the chief truſt in the City, which was ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by him, that he and his Off-ſpring continued Abſolute Princes there for above a hundred years, till their Ambition and Inſolence provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked their Neighbours to arm to their ruine. The firſt thing <hi>Maſtinus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook was to chaſe away Count <hi>Boniface</hi> and the <hi>Guelphs;</hi> but they going to <hi>Ferrara</hi> made known the danger their Party was in from ſuch a growing enemy, and <hi>Actiolin</hi>'s crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and eaſily engaged the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93968:87"/>
to aſſiſt them, but <hi>Maſtinus</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their approach, not thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf able yet to deal with him who had ſo lately ruined <hi>Actiolin</hi> and his Family agreed to reſtore the Count, and thoſe he had baniſhed, and kept himſelf afterwards within the terms of moderation, as long as the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs lived.</p>
            <p>The ſupport the <hi>Gibellins</hi> had from <hi>Manfred</hi> made <hi>

               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:93968:87"/>
both helped to cover them, and render his virtues the more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous. And upon the whole matter it muſt be acknowledged he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the worſt Party, ſeeing the <hi>Gibellins</hi> Cauſe, how ill ſoever they managed it, was much the juſteſt, they maintained the Emperours undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Rights, which the <hi>Guelphs</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Popes Spiritual Arms had cut off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Azo</hi> leaving his Grand-child <hi>Opizo</hi> too young to undertake the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Biſhop of <hi>Ferrara</hi> under a pretence of the danger of the times that required a Prince able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect them, would have come to a new Choice; but ſuch was the reſpect the City generally had for the Family of <hi>Eſté,</hi> that the Biſhops practices ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only to make them the more watchfull in preſerving <hi>Opizo</hi>'s right. In this <hi>Mantoua, Padoua,</hi> and the Neighbour places encouraged them, offering their aſſiſtance if required towards <hi>Opizo</hi>'s eſtabliſhment; and the <hi>Turcii</hi> a powerfull Family, who with moſt vigour withſtood the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, were appointed Guardians du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

The War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Manfred</hi> was declared a Holy and a meritorious Expedition, and none in <hi>Lombardy</hi> promoted it more than <hi>Opizo,</hi> or rather his Guardians: The iſſue of all was, <hi>Charles</hi> and the worſt Cauſe prevailed, <hi>Manfred</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing <label type="milestone">

winter with <hi>Scaliger</hi> conſulting about the method of carrying on the war while <hi>Opizo</hi>'s Guardians, and the <hi>Guelphs,</hi> nothing frighted by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies nearneſs, raiſed what Troops they could for <hi>Charles:</hi> Early in the ſpring both Parties appeared in the field, but the fate that purſued <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroſſa</hi>'s Family ſoon overtook <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rardin.</hi> The <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Gibellins</hi> were beat, the poor Prince made priſoner, and in the eighteenth year of his age ſentenced by <hi>Charles,</hi> not without the Popes privacy and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to die as a common traytor by the hand of an Executioner for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to recover what of right did belong to him.</p>
            <p>The Guardians reſigning the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to <hi>Opizo</hi> now of age, he by his ſtrict Union with <hi>Charles</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered himſelf from all the ſtorms <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinus Scaliger,</hi> and the <hi>Gibellins</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. It is true, the extinction of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroſſa</hi>'s Family in <hi>Conrardin</hi> had brought them ſo low, that for ſome time they durſt ſcarce own the name or the quarrel, however they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not wayes to continue the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93968:89"/>
and <hi>Maſtinus</hi> kept them in hopes of great things under a new Emperour; but when application was made to <hi>Rodolphus</hi> Count of <hi>Hapsburgh,</hi> the firſt of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> that had the Imperial Crown, no arguments could work upon him to come into <hi>Italy,</hi> or to intrigue himſelf at all in the concerns of that Nation ſo fatal to his Predeceſſors, whom, he ſaid, he could trace going thither, but could meet with no foot-ſteps of their return: from him as <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonius,</hi> and the beſt Writers obſerve, <hi>Italy</hi> may date its liberty, ſeeing any City could purchaſe of <hi>Rodolphus</hi> what Government it pleaſed; though if we look narrowly into this thing, it proved rather a changing Maſters than any true liberty, and in many places a loſing the protection of an Emperour to be under the laſh of ſome petty Tyrant, it made way for the greatneſs of the Church, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the <hi>French,</hi> and in general, it fared worſe with <hi>Italy</hi> afterwards, though in ſome places they fell into gentle hands, as happily <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Regio</hi> did when joyned with <hi>Ferrara</hi> under the ſame Prince.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:93968:89"/>
The Church was ſoon ſenſible how little it had got by exchanging <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> for <hi>French,</hi> who ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves once fixt in <hi>Italy,</hi> could not be ſatisfied, unleſs they had the ſpiritual power likewiſe; and according to the vanity natural to moſt people in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, but in a peculiar manner to the <hi>French,</hi> they talked of nothing but a <hi>French</hi> Pope, a <hi>French</hi> Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and to have all new modelled in their way. This made <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the third a proud <hi>Italian</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſini</hi> who hated and contemned all <hi>Tramontani,</hi> and particularly the <hi>French,</hi> vigorouſly beſtir himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Charles,</hi> and the firſt that found the ill effects of his diſpleaſure was <hi>Opizo,</hi> againſt whom he armed <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Scaliger,</hi> and the <hi>Gibellins,</hi> that <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1276</label> by this means he might weaken the Kings Party in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which <hi>Opizo</hi> kept up. We have not the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the War betwixt <hi>Scaliger</hi> and the Marqueſs, only it is to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it went not ill with <hi>Opizo,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Articles of the Peace after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards concluded are moſt favourable to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:93968:90"/>
After the Peace was made up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Opizo</hi> and <hi>Scaliger,</hi> the Popes Arts, and the inſolence of the <hi>French</hi> drew ſuddain ruine upon them in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily;</hi> for <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Arragon</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to <hi>Manfreds</hi> Daughter, coming thither with his Navy, the <hi>Sicilians,</hi> as it was before agreed on, at the hour of <hi>Veſpers</hi> fell upon the <hi>French</hi> in all parts of the Kingdom, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compaſſion or reſpect, maſſacred Men, Women and Children, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently <hi>Peter</hi> with his <hi>Spaniards</hi> land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, took poſſeſſion of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>The Popes hatred againſt <hi>Charles,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſucceſs did not a little help to ſet up the <hi>Gibellins</hi> again, who began in ſeveral places to return up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Guelphs</hi> the ill uſage they had lately met with: But <hi>Opizo</hi> bore no <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1286</label> ſhare in thoſe diſturbances, having made a Peace to his mind, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Prince of <hi>Verona</hi>'s Daughter, and now he was ſo far from taking pleaſure in heading a Faction, that for the future he reſolv'd to put on the perſon of an Umpire, and to uſe his Authority in compoſing diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93968:90"/>
among his Neighbours. For his honour he was the firſt man that thought of employing himſelf this way, becauſe the animoſities they had been bred up to from their Infancy, had ſo heated and ſour'd their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, that their whole ſtudy was how to ruine one another, looking upon this as the only method to ſecure themſelves. Yet <hi>Opizo</hi> ſhewed the world, that as he could put off thoſe Principles his Grand-father had infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in him, ſo by his means others could be brought to righter appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of things, and differences be made up betwixt Families which were judged abſolutely irreconcileable.</p>
            <p>An inſtance of this he gave at <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> where he brought ſeveral Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which had long lived in open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance to an entire friendſhip; and ſcarce was he got back to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> when Ambaſſadors from <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Regio,</hi> came to declare him their Prince: The Emperour likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of this choice, confirmed to <hi>Opizo,</hi> and his Succeſſors, the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Principality of thoſe Cities, which continue to this day in their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93968:91"/>
to the Houſe of <hi>Eſté,</hi> and have in theſe latter Times given ſignal marks of their fidelity to their Princes, beyond moſt people of <hi>Lombardy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So great were the diſtractions of <hi>Modena,</hi> and <hi>Regio,</hi> when they choſe <hi>Opizo</hi> for their Prince, that it was thought ſtrange they could ever be brought to agree in any thing; yet the Opinion both parties had of his worth and juſtice, made them not only unanimous in chuſing him, but likewiſe in ſubmitting all their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to his determination, and his Prudence and Authority ſoon put an end to them: This was the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable paſſage of <hi>Opizo</hi>'s life, for at his return to <hi>Ferrara</hi> he died. He was a prudent and a fortunate Prince, had in his youth ſhewed both reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conduct in ſeveral enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes; but the latter part of his life was ſtill the moſt glorious, and he got alſo more in a few years by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> than his Grand-father had done all his time by fomenting their unnatural divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>He left three Sons, the eldeſt was
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93968:91"/>
               <hi>Azo</hi> the ninth, whom the <hi>French</hi> in <hi>Naples</hi> highly careſſed, knowing his friendſhip to be neceſſary for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their intereſt in <hi>Lombardy:</hi> But the <hi>Padouans</hi> were like to have given him much trouble by ſetting up his younger Brother <hi>Aldobrandin,</hi> had not the Patriarch of <hi>Aquileia</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted the matter before it broke out into an open war. The City of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> had more reſpect for <hi>Azo,</hi> and reſolved to follow the example of <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Regio;</hi> but <hi>Bologna</hi> did ſo deal with the <hi>Gibellins,</hi> that they could not be brought to conſent to it. This ill office the Marqueſs did much reſent, and thereupon began a war with <hi>Bologna,</hi> which laſted a <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1297</label> long time, and was proſecuted by him with ſuch heat, that <hi>Bologna</hi> ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the danger, ſent to the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Florentins,</hi> to intercede with the Marqueſs for a peace. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Viſconti</hi> and <hi>Torriani</hi> had long divided <hi>Milan,</hi> either of them affecting the Soveraignty by the ruine of the other; at laſt by the favour of the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh, who began again to meddle with the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:93968:92"/>
affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> neglected by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors for almoſt ſixty years, <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conti</hi> not only prevailed but grew on a ſudden ſo powerfull, that he was like to ſwallow up all near him; the Cities of <hi>Pavia, Vergelli, Novara, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona, Crema</hi> and <hi>Bergamo,</hi> apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves moſt in danger, did with the Marqueſs of <hi>Ferrara, Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> and <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> enter into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy to pull <hi>Viſconti</hi> down; and <hi>Azo</hi> being declared their General, did ſo ſucceſsfully manage the war, that <hi>Viſconti</hi> was ſoon humbled, and might have been brought low enough, had the League continued. After the concluſion of the Peace, <hi>Beatrix, Azo</hi>'s Siſter was contracted to <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liazo, Viſconti</hi>'s Son, and the marriage ſolemnized at <hi>Milan</hi> with ſuch mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence as <hi>Italy</hi> had not ſeen of late years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Viſconti</hi> being a little depreſſed, <hi>Azo</hi> was abſolutely the greateſt Prince of <hi>Lombardy;</hi> for beſides <hi>Ferrara, Modena, Regio, Rovigo, Commachio,</hi> with ſeveral other places of leſs note, all his own, <hi>Bergamo, Cremona, Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> and <hi>Pavia</hi> lived under his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93968:92"/>
and were ready at a call: This made <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, King of <hi>Naples,</hi> willingly hearken to a match betwixt the Marqueſs and his youngeſt Daughter, having married her three elder Siſters to two Kings, and the firſt Prince of the blood in <hi>France:</hi> Such an Alliance we muſt allow was highly for the honour of the Houſe of <hi>Eſté,</hi> but proved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy in its conſequences; for the Neighbours grew jealous of <hi>Azo,</hi> as they had formerly been of <hi>Viſconti,</hi> and it was given out that the King of <hi>Naples</hi> and he deſigned to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and then to divide <hi>Italy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them; that <hi>Azo</hi> was to have all upon this ſide, and the King all beyond the <hi>Appenin.

            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:93968:93"/>
The loſs of two Cities gave not ſo much diſcouragement to <hi>Azo,</hi> as the revolt of his Brother, with others of <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1308</label> his Subjects, which made him doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full whom to truſt; but the ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able arrival of his Father in Laws troops from <hi>Naples,</hi> and of ſome from the <hi>Swiſſes,</hi> together with ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>Catalonian</hi> Horſe did remove his fears, and put his affairs in ſo good a poſture, that it is believed, it would have gone hard with his Enemies, if he had lived to finiſh that Campagne.</p>
            <p>No wonder if <hi>Francis</hi> who durſt rebel againſt his Brother, did diſpute the Title with his Son <hi>Friſcus</hi> after his death; but it ſeems there was a Will either found or feigned, in which <hi>Azo</hi> had declared him his Succeſſor; by this and the Legate of <hi>Bologna</hi>'s help, he raiſed a tumult againſt <hi>Friſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> got poſſeſſion of the City of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> and was by the Magiſtrates and People ſaluted Marqueſs. The Caſtle whither <hi>Friſcus</hi> retired had a <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Garriſon, and made a ſtout re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, till <hi>Friſcus</hi> ſeeing things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, ſtole away by night to <hi>Venice</hi> where he died, and left the Garriſon
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93968:93"/>
to the mercy of the Legate, who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the eyes of all the <hi>Venetians</hi> to be pulled out: <hi>Francis</hi> likewiſe had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon to brag of his Conqueſt, for the Legate aſſuming the whole Authority, ſent him to reſide at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigo,</hi> where by his order he was ſoon after murdered.</p>
            <p>The Pope, firſt by countenancing, and then by murdering this ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Prince got <hi>Ferrara</hi> to himſelf; but ſuch wicked practices did ſo alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the hearts of the People, that to preſerve it from the Emperour he was adviſed to conſign it into <hi>Robert</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> hands: <hi>Robert,</hi> though Brother to <hi>Beatrix Azo</hi>'s Wife, kept it more by the ſtrength of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon than the affections of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants who retained an inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and paſſion for the injured Princes of <hi>Eſté,</hi> and waited but for an occaſion to expreſs it. One day it happened that the Governour in his anger gave a blow to a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> of which he died; whereupon in an inſtant all were in Arms, and he with the Garriſon, with much ado got to the Caſtle, which

was ill provided to hold out long: The news came immediately to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigo,</hi> where <hi>Azo</hi> the Son of <hi>Francis</hi> and his Couſin German <hi>Rinaldus, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobrandin</hi>'s Son then lived, who while they were reſolving with their friends what courſe to take, a ſolemn invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the City of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the fears of their not being wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and determined them in their reſolutions, ſo that they began their journey thither next morning: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on advice of their approach, all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe who were actually employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſiege of the Caſtle went out to meet them, accompanying them firſt to the Church, then to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, without the leaſt diſturbance; the Garriſon in a day or two came to capitulate, and were diſmiſt with their Governour; and the City in a gratefull remembrance of ſo unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a delivery, kept every fifth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> a day of Thankſgiving, ſo long as there was a Marqueſs or Duke of <label type="milestone">

               <hi>Ferrara.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The joy for the Princes Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was doubly allay'd; firſt, by the death of <hi>Azo,</hi> to whom <hi>Rinaldus Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobrandin</hi>'s
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:93968:94"/>
Son ſucceeded, then by the Popes procedure which could not have been more violent if <hi>Rinaldus</hi> had been acceſſary to his Uncles death, whom the Legate murdered, or had been guilty of Uſurpation in accepting his own, he was preſently excommunicated, and his Subjects commanded in thirty dayes, under the like pain, to caſt off <hi>Rinaldus</hi> and his Miniſters, and receive the Popes: But neither in Prince nor People did the Pope meet with that compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he expected, for <hi>Rinaldus</hi> could not be ſo eaſily frighted from what he was ſure he had ſo good a right to, and the Citizens inſtead of reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting him, did by an humble Addreſs entreat him, that he would not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don nor give them up who had been ſo faithfull to his Anceſtors, and ſo ready to ſhake off the Churches yoke to return to their Allegiance, aſſuring him, that no threats nor allurements ſhould ever debauch them from their Duty to their Natural Prince. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Ambaſſadors were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to their Neighbours, with an account of the Popes dealings,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:93968:95"/>
and the reſolutions of <hi>Rinaldus,</hi> and <hi>Galleazo</hi> of <hi>Milan, Canis Scaliger</hi> of <hi>Verona,</hi> with the great <hi>Caſtrucius</hi> of <hi>Luca,</hi> and the baniſhed <hi>Florentins</hi> enter into a League for the defence of the Marqueſs of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> in caſe the Pope ſhould proceed any further in his unjuſt pretences. But after many attempts for ſeveral years to little purpoſe the Pope took off the ſentence which he had ſo raſhly and unjuſtly pronounced againſt <hi>Rinal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and confirmed whatever was done at <hi>Ferrara</hi> during the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. <label type="milestone">

            <p>A ſhort time diſcovered the Popes Peace with the Marqueſs of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and his Brothers was intended only to diſarm them, that ſo he might the better fall upon the City: In order to it the Legate of <hi>Bologna</hi> made great preparations, and notice being given to the adjacent places of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magna,</hi> to be in readineſs, the whole buſineſs was carried on ſo cloſely, that the Legate inveſted <hi>Ferrara</hi> with an Army of thirty thouſand men before the Marqueſs ſuſpected his deſign: Every Gentleman of <hi>Ferrara</hi> ſhewed
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:93968:95"/>
as much concern as the Marqueſs could to diſappoint the Pope, who had ſo treacherouſly ſurprized them: and the place, though ill provided, held out by this means beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, till the thing being blaz'd abroad, <hi>Viſconti</hi> from <hi>Milan, Gonza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga</hi> from <hi>Mantoua, Scaliger</hi> from <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona,</hi> without exception of <hi>Guelphs</hi> or <hi>Gibellins</hi> in this common danger ſent Forces to relieve it. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs having private information of their approach, went out by night, leaving the place to his Brother <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pizo,</hi> with Order to make a Salley at ſuch a time as he with the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates ſhould advance towards the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Camp; which being accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly performed, the Popes Army was unexpectedly beſet upon all hands, and received ſuch a total over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, that very few eſcaped being killed or taken priſoners.</p>
            <p>The Marqueſs upon his return, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom of that age, after any ſignal military performance, was ſolemnly Knighted with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by <hi>Tauriſanus,</hi> the moſt repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Captain of the City: This ſort
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:93968:96"/>
of Knighthood they judged ſo honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, that the greateſt Princes were willing to receive it from the hands of their own Subjects; an inſtance of this we meet with in <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, who thought it worth the while to ſend for the compleat <hi>Chevalier de Bayon,</hi> one of his Generals in <hi>Italy</hi> to be Knighted by him, as if he looked upon this to make him ſomewhat more a Gentleman than the Crown of <hi>France</hi> did.</p>
            <p>Not long after died <hi>Rinaldus,</hi> and <hi>Modena</hi> which he had beſieged many months, fell into his Brother <hi>Opizo</hi>'s hands: To grace his firſt entry up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Government, this City hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deprived it ſelf for above thirty years of the protection of the Houſe of <hi>Eſté,</hi> toſt from one Maſter to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, could never find reſt till it took ſanctuary there again.</p>

               <p>A brief account of what past in <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy</hi> from <hi>Opizo</hi>'s advancement till that of <hi>Borſius</hi> the first Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and of the Council held at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> to unite the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Churches under <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth; with ſeveral other memor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tranſactions.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>NOthing is more entertaining than the Hiſtory of the ebbings and flowings of the Ruling Families of <hi>Lombardy</hi> in thoſe dayes; when any one of them grew too Great the reſt combined to level it. Thus it had lately fared with the Families of <hi>Eſté</hi> and <hi>Viſconti,</hi> as I obſerved; and now <hi>Scaliger</hi> was to have his turn, being the only object of their jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie: for beſides <hi>Verona</hi> he had ten more Cities under him, kept five thouſand <hi>Germans</hi> conſtantly in pay, affected the Title of King of <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> and was grown intolerably inſolent. The firſt that began with him were the two Republicks of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:93968:97"/>
and <hi>Florence;</hi> afterwards <hi>Viſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga</hi> agreed to enter into the League, both that they might be ſharers in the Conqueſt, and thereby keep the Republicks from enriching themſelves too much, and likewiſe when they thought fit might ſtop the current before <hi>Scaliger</hi> were utterly ruined. In a ſhort time <hi>Scaliger</hi> loſt ſeven of his Cities, which were divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Conquerours. But the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentins,</hi> for all their ſubtilty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the <hi>Lombards</hi> were outwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Viſconti,</hi> and had ſcarce enough allowed them to defray the charges of the War: the Hoſtages for performance of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Peace were conſigned by all Parties into the hands of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs, who towards the latter end behaved himſelf more like a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor than an Enemy to <hi>Scaliger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Azo</hi> of <hi>Correggio</hi> not being able to keep <hi>Parma</hi> ſold it to <hi>Opizo,</hi> and the City it ſelf, willingly came under a Prince of <hi>Eſté,</hi> having found it ſelf ſo happy when Governed by that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily four hundred years before; the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93968:97"/>
people at <hi>Opizo</hi>'s arrival to expreſs <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1347</label> their affection to their new Maſter, ſtrengthened his Title, by chuſing him anew: but after ſome time the Marqueſs perceiving how <hi>Viſconti</hi> and <hi>Gonzaga</hi> both lay in wait for it, how uneaſie a thing it would be for him to keep it, there being no Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication betwixt this and his other Cities, and how at beſt he muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to entail a War upon his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity with theſe Princes, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to part with it upon the ſame terms that he bought it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Opizo</hi> paſt the reſt of his time in great tranquillity, and having out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived all his Brothers, left at his death ſeven Sons very young; this encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged his Nephew <hi>Francis</hi> that was ſupported by <hi>Viſconti,</hi> whoſe Niece he had married, to make an attempt upon <hi>Ferrara;</hi> but <hi>Aldobrandin</hi> the ſecond, though he was not then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſeventeen years of age, and had none of his Family fit to adviſe him, yet behaved himſelf ſo well, and found the Nobility ſo faithfull, that <hi>Francis</hi> ſeeing no likelihood of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing what he deſigned retired to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:93968:98"/>
               <hi>Milan,</hi> and never afterwards offered to give him the leaſt diſturbance.</p>
            <p>The Wars betwixt the Republicks of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Genoua</hi> engaged moſt of the Princes of <hi>Lombardy</hi> in their quarrel, <hi>Viſconti</hi> declared for <hi>Genoua,</hi> and contributed largely towards the charge; <hi>Aldobrandin, Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> of <hi>Padoua</hi> were for the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians. Viſconti</hi> not knowing well how to come at the <hi>Venetians,</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſet upon their Confederates, and by the help of <hi>Bologna</hi> laid ſiege to <hi>Modena,</hi> which was looked upon as the eaſieſt enterprize; but young <hi>Aldobrandin</hi> with thirty thouſand <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1356</label> men entering into <hi>Viſconti</hi>'s Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories call'd him home to defend his own Countrey before he could take the City. His grief for being thus treated by ſo young a Captain ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened his death; and ſoon after him died <hi>Aldobrandin,</hi> the moſt hopefull Prince of <hi>Italy,</hi> being but in the flower of his age.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Nicolaus Aldobrandin</hi>'s youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brother found <hi>Barnabas Viſconti</hi> like to be as troubleſome as his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he offered to the Legate of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna,</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:93968:98"/>
to <hi>Gonzaga</hi> &amp; to <hi>Scaliger,</hi> whoſe Daughter he married to concur in keeping a ſtanding Army as the beſt expedient to bridle his ambition, by which <hi>Barnabas</hi> was ſo highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, that the firſt thing he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took was to invade the Marqueſſes Countrey: <hi>Nicolaus</hi> having ſecret advice of his deſign, made himſelf ready, and gave <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſuch a brisk reception, that many of his men being killed, and ſeveral of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>Milan</hi> taken priſoners, he with the reſt made a ſhamefull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. <hi>Barnabas</hi> then ſeemed willing to hearken to a Peace, offering to refer all their differences to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth, nor could he have wiſhed for a more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Umpire than him whoſe Grand-father had firſt ſet up the <hi>Viſconti</hi> at <hi>Milan,</hi> who had himſelf made his Father <hi>Viſconti</hi> Vicar of <hi>Italy,</hi> and who had lately expreſſed great kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for himſelf; yet upon ſecond thoughts, <hi>Barnabas</hi> concluded it not ſo well for him to make Peace with <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> till his loſt honour were in ſome meaſure repaired, which made
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93968:99"/>
him prepare another Army againſt the Marqueſs; but the Emperour ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it ill to have the buſineſs firſt referred to him, and then to have <hi>Barnabas</hi> think of revenging himſelf, deprived him of the Title of Vicar, and of all other Imperial Priviledges, forbidding any of the Vaſſals of the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1365</label> Empire to aſſiſt or countenance him. <hi>Barnabas</hi> to wave this ſtorm accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of what terms were propoſed him.</p>
            <p>This Peace it was hoped might have laſted a long time, but <hi>Barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> ſtill in his heart hated <hi>Nicolaus</hi> as the occaſion of the Emperours being diſpleaſed with him; and <hi>Nicolaus</hi> could never be well reconciled to <hi>Barnabas,</hi> while he kept <hi>Regio,</hi> which of right belonged to him: ſo that no wonder if both parties watched only for an opportunity of falling out. After many and great diſputes too tedious to be ſet down, <hi>Nicolaus</hi> recovered <hi>Regio</hi> that had long been <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1374</label> out of the Family, and then was he contented to ſtand upon his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: The moſt he did was to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance all Parties when either of them
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:93968:99"/>
grew too ſtrong; but he chiefly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed himſelf in deciding their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, by which he got a great Name, and never wanted buſineſs, the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Carrara</hi> of <hi>Padoua,</hi> the Cities of <hi>Bologna</hi> and <hi>Florence,</hi> with ſeveral others freely ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to his arbitration.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Nicolaus</hi> had ſpent many years in this deſirable ſtation, <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazo Viſconti</hi> fell upon the <hi>Scaligers,</hi> chaſed away the Father, killed the Son, and took <hi>Verona.</hi> It troubled <hi>Nicolaus</hi> to ſee the Family out of which he had married a Wife, ruined in an inſtant, and to ſee <hi>Viſconti,</hi> for whom of all other he had the leaſt kindneſs, ſo great a gainer by it; he ſolicited hotly the Princes and Free Cities of <hi>Lombardy</hi> to take Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Galleazo,</hi> and brought them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to a reſolution; but his ſudden <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1387</label> death, and the fate of the Houſe of <hi>Scaliger</hi> made all endeavours to ſave it ineffectual.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nicolaus</hi> left but one Son, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into a Religious Order, reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all to his Couſin <hi>Albertus; Galleazo</hi> was now too great for <hi>Albertus</hi> to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:93968:100"/>
oppoſe, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> made him ſide with <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leazo,</hi> that ſo if he got nothing by the ruine of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> he might at leaſt ſave himſelf, that was moſt likely to ſuffer next. This League they term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed everlaſting, though as the motives upon which it was made, ſeemed to promiſe no ſuch thing; ſo neither did it prove ſuch in the iſſue: for as ſoon as <hi>Galleazo</hi> was engaged in a War with <hi>Florence,</hi> his new Subjects of <hi>Verona</hi> and <hi>Padoua</hi> revolted, and threatened to fall upon the Marqueſs, unleſs he would joyn with them. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus</hi> being afterwards at leiſure founded the Univerſity of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> whither his bounty drew ſome of the chief Profeſſors in all Arts and Sciences, amongſt others <hi>Salicetus</hi> that moſt famed Civilian; but when he thought to have dedicated the reſt of his time, and no ſmall part of his Revenue to the Muſes, his ſudden death deprived the Learned of the beſt Patron of that age.</p>
            <p>By his Will he recommended his Son <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> being yet a Child, to the tuition and care of the chief Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> ordering, that by
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:93968:100"/>
turns they ſhould have the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Affairs till he came of age, that ſo all having ſome ſhare in the Government, they might the more heartily eſpouſe their young Princes intereſt. Moſt thought it a thing not practicable for ſo many perſons, ſometimes to ſit at the Helm, and then to return to their private ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to own the Superiority of thoſe whom they had lately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: But for ſeveral years this courſe did wonderfully ſucceed, none while in Authority, ſhewing any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ambition than that of diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their truſt faithfully; and in compliance to the Orders left by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus,</hi> giving up their Commiſſions at the time limited, with the ſame chearfulneſs that at firſt they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them. During the Princes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, <hi>Azo</hi> the Son of <hi>Francis,</hi> and a Grand-child of the Family of <hi>Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conti,</hi> did by open force, as well as by poiſon, and other wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, attempt the death of <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> till happily he was taken and kept priſoner, notwithſtanding the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours uſed by thoſe of <hi>Milan</hi> for his

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1396</label> alwayes in Arms upon <hi>Azo</hi>'s ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, put the Government to ſo great charge, that a conſiderable ſumm was borrowed of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and <hi>Rovigo</hi> given them in pledge for it. By this Republicks means a match was concluded betwixt <hi>Nicolaus</hi> and the Daughter of <hi>Francis Carrara,</hi> who now next to <hi>Viſconti</hi> was the moſt powerfull Prince of thoſe parts, he being then abſolute Maſter of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rona, Vicenza, Bellimo, Feltry</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doua,</hi> moſt of which came to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, firſt by the depreſſion, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by the ruine of the <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi>

               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:93968:101"/>
had kept that City; but upon his recovery, being jealous of his Father in Law's ill intentions, he diſmiſt the <hi>Padouans,</hi> and made uſe of thoſe who had formerly ſerved him.</p>
            <p>The deſigns of <hi>John Galleazo,</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Created Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> by <hi>Wen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſlaus</hi> the Emperour, tended plainly to the ſubverſion of <hi>Lombardy; Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logna</hi> by the ſlaughter of the <hi>Bentivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glio</hi>'s was fallen to him; he had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Perugia</hi> and ſeveral other places upon that hand; and if he had lived a few months longer, <hi>Florence</hi> could not have ſaved it ſelf. His death en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Pope and others to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a War with his Son, a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate being ſent to <hi>Ferrara</hi> to declare <hi>Nicolaus</hi> General of the Church; but the Dutcheſs Dowager of <hi>Milan</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of what might follow upon ſuch a Combination, made earneſt ſute for Peace, which ſhe bought with the loſs of <hi>Bologna, Perugia</hi> and <hi>Aſizi.</hi>

For an Inſurrection at <hi>Parma, Ottobon</hi> hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſixty five of the Chief Citizens; and dangers threatning him both at home and from abroad, he ſeemed willing to give ſatisfaction to <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> whom he had moſt injured, and appointed a Conference with him, hoping by this means to have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to kill <hi>Nicolaus:</hi> Advice being brought to <hi>Nicolaus</hi> of <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi>'s deſign, he came to the place well guarded, and leaving his men at ſome diſtance, as <hi>Ottobon</hi> alſo did his, both with a few truſty friends came together to diſcourſe the buſineſs: <hi>Franciſcus Forza</hi> afterwards Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> being there with <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> and obſerving ſome of <hi>Ottobons</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers caſt themſelves into a certain figure, which they were to do before they fell on, prevented them, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold upon <hi>Ottobon,</hi> and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by others, killed him out-right; all his party deſerting him beſides his Brother and one other Officer. Since <hi>Actiolins</hi> time there had not been a more cruel Tyrant than <hi>Ottobon,</hi> yet they adviſed <hi>Nicolaus</hi> to ſatisfie the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:93968:103"/>
world by a publick Declaration, that what he did was in his own defence; nothing but this being able to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the killing any man after ſuch a manner.</p>
            <p>While the Marqueſs lay before <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio,</hi> an Ambaſſadour from <hi>Venice</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in the Camp to give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that the reſt of <hi>Ottobons</hi> Family being fled thither, as to the ſanctuary of the oppreſſed, they ſent to offer their mediation, expecting he would proceed no further. <hi>Nicolaus</hi> thought it a little hard to be required, not to meddle with what belonged to his Family; yet not being willing to come to a rupture ſuddenly with <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> he endeavoured to gain time in returning a ſmooth and ambiguous anſwer, and in a few dayes had both <hi>Regio</hi> and <hi>Parma</hi> delivered him. When the <hi>Venetians</hi> underſtood this, they wiſely declined medling any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſo deſperate a buſineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing their protection from <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi>'s friends, and owning the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs for their Confederate; this <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colaus</hi> took ſo kindly, that he never ceaſed, till by his mediation the Peace

            <p>The Emperour was troubled to ſee the Church rent by ſo many Popes at one time, and thereupon aſſembled the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> where <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedict</hi> the thirteenth, <hi>Gregory</hi> the twelfth, and <hi>John</hi> the twenty fourth were depoſed; and <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth choſen, and the new Pope in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> paſſing by <hi>Ferrara,</hi> was with all his train ſumptuouſly treated by the Marqueſs, whom in the name of the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> he thanked for the Peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by his means, betwixt the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and for his conſtant forwardneſs in promoting the publick good: <hi>Parma</hi> growing troubleſome to him, he ſold it to the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> who at the ſame time renounced all his pretenſions to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio.</hi> It was thought that <hi>Lombardy</hi> was then ſufficiently purged from all ſeeds of diſcord; when <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan</hi>'s ſeizing upon <hi>Genoua,</hi> and threatning <hi>Florence,</hi> gave a freſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm, the <hi>Venetians</hi> offered the <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentins</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Who could have imagined, that after having thus ſmarted, the Duke ſhould have come to another breach; but the natural inconſtancy of that Prince, the ill grounded opinion he had of his own ſufficiency, and the flatteries of thoſe about him, who
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:93968:104"/>
when ever he miſcarried, pretended he was betrayed, never ſuffered him to live at eaſe; the <hi>Venetians</hi> on the other hand, underſtanding perfectly with whom they had to deal, ſeem'd to be afraid of his Power, that ſo they might haſten a rupture, being ſure alwayes to gain ſomewhat by falling out with the Duke of <hi>Milan:</hi> How hard a task then had the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1436</label> to keep the ballance even, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two ſo unequal parties, which yet he did all his time?

            <p>From the deſign then a foot to Unite the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Churches, I muſt beg leave of my Reader to give a ſhort account in the firſt place of their differences, which were both about ſome ſpeculative points; as
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:93968:105"/>
that of the Proceſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, and alſo about Rituals, as the Conſecrating leavened or unlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened Bread; but that which chiefly made the breach ſo wide, was the Conteſt about Supremacy. The Popes pretenſions to Univerſal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over all Chriſtian Churches, are too well known to be much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged on. Upon the other hand, the <hi>Greeks</hi> only allowed them to be Patriarchs of the Weſt, and ſaid that the riſe of their Dignity was not from the pretended Succeſſion to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter,</hi> but from <hi>Romes</hi> being then the Metropolis of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, which clearly appeared by what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed upon the tranſlation of the Imperial Seat to <hi>Byzantium;</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of that See, being declared in two of the firſt four General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils Equal in all things to the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> excepting only Preceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; becauſe <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was <hi>New Rome,</hi> expreſſing by this what Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion they had of the Rights old <hi>Rome</hi> then enjoyed, ſeeing they did not aſcribe them to a Divine Original, but to the Dignity of the City. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:93968:105"/>
this great diſputes aroſe betwixt the Biſhops of thoſe Sees, while the one would not acknowledge a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, nor the other an Equal; the Popes endeavoured to engage in their behalf the Patriarchs of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and of <hi>Antioch,</hi> as ancienter than thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to whom they were not to yield the precedency. From the dayes of the moſt learned <hi>Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> theſe unhappy differences ſetled in a formed Schiſm, and gave no ſmall advantage to the <hi>Saracens</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> over the Eaſtern Chriſtians, in whoſe ruine the Popes ſeemed but little concerned.</p>
            <p>An Union betwixt the Churches had been long deſired, and <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth, <hi>Martin</hi>'s Succeſſor find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this a plauſible pretence to ruine the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi> then aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, called another at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> where he knew he had a friend in <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> and invited the <hi>Greeks</hi> with large promiſes thither. Nor could the Pope have wiſhed for a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable conjuncture, ſeeing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the two Eaſtern Empires of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Trapezond,</hi> that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:93968:106"/>
were ready to be ſwallowed up by the <hi>Turk,</hi> made them, in hopes of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from <hi>Italy,</hi> willing to come to any accommodation. The Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople, John Palaeologus,</hi> to promote the buſineſs, reſolved to be there in perſon; and <hi>Nicolaus</hi> upon his arrival at <hi>Venice,</hi> went thither to welcom him, had him lodged in the Pallace of <hi>Eſté,</hi> and then returned to <hi>Ferrara</hi> to make ready for his reception. The Emperour being accompanied by his Brother <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> Deſpot of the <hi>Morea,</hi> the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of <hi>Trapezond,</hi> and the moſt conſiderable Biſhops of <hi>Greece,</hi> in all ſeven hundred, were met by <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> and a Noble Equipage at ſome diſtance from <hi>Ferrara:</hi> The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour was conducted directly to the Pope, who to ſhew him, as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, an extraordinary mark of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, would not ſuffer him to kneel, but embraced him in his arms with great expreſſions of kindneſs; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Nicolaus</hi> brought the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to an apartment richly furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him in the Palace, called Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, where he received the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:93968:106"/>
of the Cardinals, and other Chief Prelates.</p>
            <p>The Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> who ſtayed at <hi>Venice</hi> till he had an account of the Emperours reception, came to <hi>Ferrara</hi> a few dayes after, but refuſed a publick Audience of the Pope, becauſe he would not obſerve the Formalities required, and all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes about Precedency being waved as much as poſſible, they held the firſt Seſſion with great ſolemnity. Here was an occaſion for <hi>Nicolaus</hi> to ſhew his hoſpitality, and the ſplendour of his Court; and to do him juſtice, though but a private Prince, he came much nearer the Magnificence of the Great <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than the Fathers of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil did thoſe of <hi>Nice</hi> in the purity of their Doctrine, or in the ſanctity of their lives: There was never a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridion,</hi> nor a <hi>Paphnutius</hi> in this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and ſcarce an <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in <hi>Marcus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> who boldly defended his Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Errours of <hi>Rome;</hi> but on the other hand, there were more than one <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> and
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:93968:107"/>
in <hi>Beſſarion</hi> no ill Image of <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> in his behaviour, but the true reverſe in his change, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily was for the worſe: after fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Seſſions the pretended fears of a Plague, and really that of the War betwixt the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> who favoured the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Baſil,</hi> made the Pope tranſlate his to <hi>Florence,</hi> where he carried things as he pleaſed. But the ſervile compliance of the <hi>Greeks</hi> meerly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a proſpect of intereſt did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appear, when being diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of their expectations at their return home moſt of them anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized what they had ſubſcribed in <hi>Italy. Beſſarion</hi> and <hi>Iſidorus</hi> only of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> charmed with the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Cardinals, and foreſeeing the approaching ruine of their Countrey, continued in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> in the beginning of this War with the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> gave the Marqueſs back <hi>Rovigo</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out requiring the ſumm borrowed upon it; but beſides this, there were other motives to perſwade the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs

to befriend them, for the Duke by the valour and conduct of his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>Francis Forza,</hi> was like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair all his former loſſes, and to wreſt the <hi>terra firma</hi> out of the <hi>Venetians</hi> hands. <hi>Nicolaus</hi> knowing well the Dukes temper found wayes to ſow the ſeeds of jealouſie betwixt him and his General, which in a ſhort time brought <hi>Forza</hi> over to the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1446</label> and with him the Dukes For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The ſiege of <hi>Breſcia</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently relieved, <hi>Verona</hi> recovered, and the Dukes New General <hi>Picininus</hi> beaten. The Duke was ſenſible of his folly in diſobliging <hi>Forza,</hi> and agreed to give him his Daughter in marriage, recommending the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the buſineſs to <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> who made up the match betwixt <hi>Forza</hi> and the Lady, and the Peace betwixt the Duke her Father and the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: This was the laſt remarkable action of <hi>Nicolaus</hi>'s life, for going to viſit the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> he died there, and in him did <hi>Italy</hi> loſe the wiſeſt Prince it had bred of many ages; he came ſhort both of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> in

power, but by turning the ſcale al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes towards the party for which he declared, he raiſed himſelf as it were above both, his riches he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in living ſplendidly, and had entertained two Emperours, and three Popes, beſides many other Princes at his Court; his two Sons by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Saluzza</hi>'s Daughter, <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> and <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> being yet but Children, he left the Government to <hi>Leonel,</hi> to whoſe Mother it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved he never was married.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leonels</hi> firſt Wife of the Houſe of <hi>Gonzaga</hi> being dead, and he raiſed to a higher ſtation, <hi>Alphonſus</hi> King of <hi>Naples</hi> accepted of him for his Son in Law; and <hi>Leonel</hi> ſent his Brother <hi>Borſius</hi> with the <hi>Venetian</hi> Gallies, to conduct the Princeſs to <hi>Venice,</hi> where the Doge and Senate took occaſion to expreſs their reſpect to King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus,</hi> and the Marqueſs in the great ſtate with which they received her.

Brother, who came to ſee her ſafe with her Husband ſeemed equally pleaſed and ſurprized with the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of the Court of <hi>Ferrara:</hi> The Prince in his return home was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> recommended by <hi>Leonel</hi> to the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> at whoſe Court, he ſaid, his Father upon his death-bed deſired they ſhould be bred; but many thought it an honourable and ſecure ſort of baniſhment, while they were kept at a Kings Court indeed, yet ſtill under the eye of <hi>Leonel</hi>'s Father in Law.</p>
            <p>The Pope, the King of <hi>Naples,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Florentins</hi> being all in War, <hi>Leonel</hi> in imitation of his Father, obſerved a perfect Neutrality; and as ſoon as the Parties were diſpoſed for Peace, offered his Mediation which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and ſent their Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries to <hi>Ferrara:</hi> This, with the many Treaties held there in the time of the former Marqueſs made <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina</hi> and <hi>Sabellicus</hi> term <hi>Ferrara</hi> the <hi>Houſe of Peace,</hi> or as we find it in ſome Letters, <hi>the Venerable Temple of

the Quiet and Liberty of</hi> Italy. While <hi>Leonel</hi> and the Plenipotentiaries were at work, the death of <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> in whom the Race of the <hi>Viſconti</hi> failed, put a ſtop to their proceedings; the Duke leaving things in that confuſion, as if he had deſigned to entail upon <hi>Lombardy</hi> the diviſions which he had all his life fomented.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Milan</hi> weary of ſo Abſolute a Government enclined to form it ſelf into a Republick, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other places were given up to the Neighbour Princes, <hi>Leonel</hi> out of his kindneſs to <hi>Forza</hi> had given him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Dukes death when it was kept ſecret; and now <hi>Pavia</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places which ſent to him, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be received into his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he turned over to <hi>Forza,</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to get for his friend what he had not courage to take for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. It is certain if <hi>Nicolaus</hi> had been alive he had ordered things more for the advantage of the Houſe of <hi>Eſté;</hi> but <hi>Leonel</hi> was not ſo well known, and every one could ſee that his love for Peace, or rather for eaſe, did ill fit him for a New Conqueſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:93968:109"/>
The <hi>Venetians</hi> were of a much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent temper, who having ſo fair an invitation to enlarge their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the <hi>terra firma,</hi> pretended that the Duke dying their declared Enemy, they might ſeize upon what they could. <hi>Forza</hi> by his Wife could ſet up no Title to the Dutchy, ſhe being a Baſtard, yet deſirous to put in for a ſhare, offered to be General of <hi>Milan</hi> againſt all who had any deſign upon it, and under this plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pretence queſtion'd not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance himſelf, which he did. The Dutcheſs Dowager knowing <hi>Forza</hi>'s ambition, endeavoured to croſs him all ſhe could, and threatned to call in <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>France</hi> to oppoſe him; but the <hi>Venetians</hi> jealous of <hi>France</hi> countenanced <hi>Forza,</hi> though after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they were ſorry to ſee him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo ſoon Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> and their gains ſo ſmall by ſo conſiderable a change: they ſolicited therefore <hi>Leonel</hi> to engage the King of <hi>Naples</hi> in a War with the New Duke, which he was not forward to meddle in, having helped to raiſe <hi>Forza</hi> to that greatneſs; and while theſe deſigns
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:93968:110"/>
were a foot, <hi>Leonel</hi> died with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation rather of a good than an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Prince.</p>
            <p>He was a great Patron of Letters, for beſides the Learned Men, whom he kept alwayes about him, and who had plentifull proviſions in his Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, <hi>Theodorus Gaza, Georgius Trapezuntius, Laurentius Valla,</hi> and ſeveral others at <hi>Rome</hi> found the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his bounty, and much did ſuch perſons ſtand in need afterwards of ſo good a ſupport in the time of <hi>Paul</hi> the ſecond, and of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, eſpecially of the latter, to whom <hi>Theodorus Gaza</hi> preſenting a Book with a fine Dedication, after having beſtowed what money his poverty could ſpare in the neatneſs of the binding, the Popes liberality to him ſcarce amounted to that charge. But <hi>Rome</hi> was then what an Ingenious <hi>French</hi> Writer obſerves of it under a certain Heathen Emperour, when one pitiful Cook had a larger allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance than fifteen excellent Orators: For it is certain, that if thoſe who fled from <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and other places, with the ruines of the <hi>Greek</hi>

               <hi>Forza</hi> was now more conſiderable than ever the late Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> had been, for though he had not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged his Dominions, yet being the greateſt Captain of his age, and one who had raiſed himſelf to this heighth meerly by his virtue, he made all <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi> ſenſible of the Power of <hi>Milan</hi> under ſuch a Duke.

were glad at any rate to buy his friendſhip, others who could not be threatned, as the King of <hi>Naples</hi> and the <hi>Venetians</hi> entered into a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy againſt him, and the leſſer Powers according to their inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſided with either, and ſo divided <hi>Italy,</hi> only <hi>Borſius</hi> having no proſpect of advantage by declaring, reſolved to continue in peace well armed, and to give or refuſe paſſage to their Troops as he ſhould judge moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.

If inſtead of ſheathing their Swords in one anothers ſides, the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of <hi>Chriſtendome</hi> had happily u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited them under ſuch a General as <hi>Forza,</hi> they might have ſaved that City and <hi>Greece</hi> from bondage, and

<pb n="199" facs="tcp:93968:115"/>
to a determination, and where the buſineſs was difficult, he would be ſure firſt to ask the Opinion of thoſe about him; and in this he took ſuch a particular pleaſure, that he often ſaid it was the chief work of Princes to be ready to examine and redreſs the grievances of the meaneſt of their Subjects; the reſt of his time he ſpent in hunting, in hawking, and in Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matches, his Stables being the beſt furniſhed of any in <hi>Italy:</hi> His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant habit was rich Brocade, and the ſame he allowed to all his Buffoons, of whom his Court, according to the humour of that age was full; one of them called <hi>Gonella</hi> of <hi>Ferrara</hi> had ſo great a Name, that every witty ſaying, and brisk repartee was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd upon him, and he was talked of in all the Courts of <hi>Italy.</hi> The hoſpitality, and bounty of <hi>Borſius</hi> was yet beyond all the reſt; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever came within the Court might eat or drink what they pleaſed, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers ſtill being in readineſs to treat them according to their quality: the names of all the poor in the City were written down, their wants plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully

hated and contemned. But <hi>Naples</hi> was too narrow to ſatisfie both the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> and <hi>Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalvo</hi> was a man of ſuch unlimited ambition, that a Controverſie began about a ſmall parcel of Ground, to which both parties pretended, and which nothing but Arms could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide.

            <p>About this time died <hi>Hercules</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> whoſe life doth repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to us Fortune in all her diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent aſpects; he was born the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Heir of one of the richeſt Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> was left young by his Father, which made him come the later to his Eſtate after the death of two Brothers: Many ſtorms did he weather both in the Court and Wars of <hi>Naples,</hi> his own Courage and the Kings Malice expoſing him to every danger, till at length he changed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

               <hi>HErcules</hi> had four Sons, <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> who ſucceeded him, <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytus</hi> the former of the two famous Cardinals of <hi>Eſté</hi> of that name, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> and <hi>Sigiſmund; Alphonſus</hi> was twice married in his Fathers time, firſt to the Daughter of <hi>Iohn Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>azo</hi> Duke of <hi>Milan</hi> when he was very young; and when ſhe died, a Match by <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth's means was made up betwixt him and <hi>Lucretia Borgia</hi> Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixth's Daughter, the King deſigning by this to unite the Duke with <hi>Caeſar Borgia,</hi> and both to himſelf. The firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable action we meet with in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus</hi> after his Fathers death, <hi>Caeſar Borgia</hi> being then ruined, was his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending <hi>Bologna</hi> for <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond, and his defeating <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> from whom the Pope had lately taken that City, and recommended it to the Duke. Not long after was the League
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:93968:123"/>
of <hi>Cambray</hi> concluded, where <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> joyned with the Emperour, the Pope, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> to take the <hi>terra firma</hi> from the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> began the War, and gave the <hi>Venetian</hi> Army, which was commanded, or rather di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by two Generals of quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent tempers, ſo great an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, that the other Confederates did thereupon make the more haſt. The <hi>Venetians</hi> ſeeing themſelves in no condition to defend their Subjects, wiſely made a virtue of neceſſity, and allowed them the liberty to make the beſt terms they could with the Enemy, and ſo prevent their ruine: for they preſumed, and upon good grounds, that this inſtance of their tenderneſs, would invite them home to their ancient Maſters as ſoon as the ſtorm was over: being attacqued then on all hands, nothing except <hi>Treviſo</hi> was left them in a ſhort time, and the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> for his ſhare was once in poſſeſſion of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigo, la Badia,</hi> with <hi>Monfelice, Eſté,</hi> and other places which formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:93968:123"/>
to his Family. Beſides the places he had taken, the Pope decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him the General of the Church, which made the <hi>Venetians</hi> diſcharge their whole fury upon him both by Sea and Land; but ſuch was their ill ſucceſs in every enterprize, that their very Navy became a prey to him that had no ſhips: for having chained them up by night within the mouth of the River where they thought themſelves ſecure, he burnt ſome, took others, and returned to <hi>Ferrara</hi> in a ſort of Naval Triumph upon one of their Chief Gallies. <label type="milestone">

            <p>The ſole hope now left the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> was to break a League in which ſo many Princes of different, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther incompatible Intereſts were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and this they found no hard matter, <hi>Julius</hi> being willing not only to take off his cenſures, but alſo to fall out with <hi>France,</hi> and to help to chaſe <hi>Lewis</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> if they would give him the places in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magna,</hi> which by the League were deſigned for him. It was not now time for the <hi>Venetians</hi> to ſtand at any thing, and therefore they readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:93968:124"/>
to the Popes propoſals, and he ſent to the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> to acquaint him with what he had done, and to deſire him to forbear any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acts of hoſtility againſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick; but the Duke excuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaying that he could not in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour nor in conſcience abandon thoſe with whom he was in Confederacy. <hi>Julius</hi> taking this excuſe for a direct upbraiding himſelf with what he had done, excommunicated the Duke im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, ſent Orders to <hi>Romagna</hi> to ſeize upon what places he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there, and exhorted the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians</hi> to fall upon him to revenge his and their quarrel: the Duke in a ſhort time loſt <hi>Rovigo,</hi> all the <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, Monfelice</hi> and <hi>Eſté</hi> on the one hand; and upon the other hand, all the places of <hi>Romagna,</hi> and which grieved him moſt, <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Saſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuolo,</hi> with ſeveral Caſtles near him: his only comfort was, he knew, that if he had pleaſed to make honour and conſcience truckle to Intereſt, he might have been a ſaver. But never reſolving to ſtear by this compaſs, nor to follow the precedent given
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:93968:124"/>
him by <hi>P. Iulius,</hi> he waited for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter times, till he could fairly recover what he had unjuſtly loſt.</p>
            <p>Never was Pope freer of his thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders than <hi>Iulius,</hi> who ſeeing his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs againſt <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> took his aim a little higher, at <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, deprived him of his Title of the moſt Chriſtian King, and of his Crown, and expoſed his Territoris as a prey to thoſe that could take them; but though his lightning did ſhine, it was not felt in <hi>France,</hi> otherwiſe than in provoking the good King to Vow, and to publiſh his Vow alſo in his coin, <hi>That he would deſtroy Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> meaning <hi>Rome.</hi> The King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile</hi> ſent an Army to aſſiſt the Pope and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> which made <hi>Lewis</hi> likewiſe re-inforce his Troops under a new General <hi>Gaſton de Foix,</hi> Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> to him he particularly recommended the concerns of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> whom of all the <hi>Italians</hi> he had found the moſt truſty Confederate, and the <hi>French</hi> Army then lying in <hi>Romagna,</hi> the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his places from <hi>Iulius. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi> was impatient till he gave the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:93968:125"/>
Enemy battle, which he did near <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna:</hi> the Duke commanded that part where the Artillery was planted, and they obſerved he uſed it with ſuch advantage, that it helped great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to obtain the victory. When the Enemies main body was routed, and their Officers gone, in a little action fitter for ſome young Captain than a General, <hi>Gaſton</hi> was unhappily killed, and by his death he made that day remarkable above all others, that a victory may be too dear bought with the loſs of a General: for from that hour the <hi>French</hi> Arms declined in <hi>Italy,</hi> and did every day loſe ground, leaving thoſe at laſt, whom they had beaten, in poſſeſſion of what they fought for. There being now no <hi>French</hi> Army in the field, the Duke enclined to an accommodation with the Pope, <hi>Fabricius Colonna</hi> whom he had taken priſoner at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> and had uſed with great civility, and diſmiſt without any ranſom, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to procure it upon equal terms; the Duke had an invitation from <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> with aſſurances, that he ſhould find a reception anſwerable
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:93968:125"/>
to <hi>Colonna</hi>'s promiſe, as indeed he did, being immediately abſolved from all his cenſures; but when they came to treat, ſuch unreaſonable demands were made, that he choſe rather to venture all than agree to them, and the Pope ſeeing his reſolution deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep him there: <hi>Colonna</hi> who was the occaſion of the Dukes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, thought his honour now ſo much at ſtake, that not valuing the Popes indignation, he brought the Duke from <hi>Rome</hi> by night in ſpite of the Guards, and committed him to the care of his Couſin <hi>Proſper Colonna,</hi> who with great Addreſs in the midſt of the noiſe of his eſcape brought him ſafe through the Popes Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
            <p>The Pope being upon this more enraged than ever, did, contrary to his promiſe, ſend to the Duke of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> and his other Officers to get what they could before the Dukes return; moſt of the Dukes Subjects looked upon him now as irrecoverably loſt, not only the places in <hi>Romagna,</hi> but alſo <hi>Regio, Breſcello</hi> and <hi>Carpi</hi> yielded, ſo that little remained to him upon
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:93968:126"/>
that hand, and all concluded that it muſt have ended in his utter ruine, had not God happily put an end to the life of <hi>Julius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The perſon in the whole Colledge next to his Brother <hi>Hippolytus</hi> whom the Duke could have wiſhed to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>Iulius,</hi> was <hi>Iohn</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici,</hi> who in the former reign had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly favoured him, and found wayes when employ'd as Legate in thoſe parts to decline the executing the Popes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent reſolutions againſt him. Upon the joyfull news of this Cardinals ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who is known by the name of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, the Duke went im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to <hi>Rome,</hi> and came in time to be abſolved anew, and to carry S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peters</hi> Standard, as great Confalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier, or General of the Church at the inauguration of <hi>Leo,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to reſtore whatever <hi>Iulius</hi> had taken from him; but in a little time he was ſo ſtrangely altered, that far from the leaſt performance, he watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every opportunity to take from the Duke what was left him. Upon a report of his being dead, <hi>Leo</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Troops to march that way,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:93968:126"/>
and when it proved a miſtake, he did endeavour to excuſe it, as if his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign had been to ſecure the Dutchy for Prince <hi>Hercules,</hi> the Dukes eldeſt Son. His ill intentions were more plainly diſcovered two years after, for he hired one <hi>Rodolphus</hi> a Captain <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1520</label> in the Dukes Guards to kill him; but the Captain by good luck had neither the courage to go through with what he had undertaken, nor yet to deny it. In ſhort, the Duke was much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in <hi>Leo,</hi> who could never be brought to make good his promiſe till <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, who ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth, being well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that all the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi>'s ſufferings, proceeded from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant adhering to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, did refuſe to enter into any treaty with the Pope, unleſs the Duke were comprehended in it.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Leo</hi>'s death no Prince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plemented <hi>Adrian</hi> the ſixth with ſo noble an Embaſſy, as the Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> did, who upon the Popes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at <hi>Rome,</hi> ſent his Son <hi>Hercules</hi> thither attended by many of his chief Nobility: the young Prince was then
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:93968:127"/>
but fourteen years of age, yet having his audience of <hi>Adrian</hi> before the Conſiſtory, he harangued ſo finely, and with ſo good a Grace, that the Pope embraced him with tears, and having asked him ſeveral queſtions in Latin, found him ſo much a Maſter of that Language, his anſwers ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and lively, and in his whole behaviour a modeſt aſſurance ſo fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his age and quality; that <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> declared before all the Cardinals, that he muſt grant the Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> whatever he demanded by ſuch an Extraordinary Ambaſſador. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eretia</hi> the Mother of <hi>Hercules</hi> being dead, there lived a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman at <hi>Ferrara,</hi> called <hi>Laura En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtochia</hi> ſufficiently qualified every way for a Princeſs, except in her birth; her perſon, her air, but above all, her wit did ſo charm the Duke, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having ſometime Courted her, ſhe came to be his third Dutcheſs, and brought him two Sons, <hi>Alphonſus</hi> and <hi>Alphonſinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much were the Duke and the Prince grieved for the death of ſo friendly a Pope as <hi>Adrian,</hi> when they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:93968:127"/>
perceived that <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeventh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to renew the practices of <hi>Leo,</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Emperour great ſumms of money to have <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Regio</hi> given to himſelf and his Family; but the Emperour being unwilling to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Houſe of <hi>Medici</hi> by an act of injuſtice to that of <hi>Eſté,</hi> would not hearken to the propoſal, though the Popes bounty to his Miniſters who were to further it, had drained the Apoſtolical Chamber: this diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment which coſt <hi>Clement</hi> ſo dear, helped to haſten his unhappy breach with the Emperour, by which <hi>Rome</hi> was expoſed to the moſt barbarous uſage it had met with ſince the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi> ſacked it, and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf impriſoned in the Caſtle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Bourbon</hi>'s Army: Duke <hi>Alphonſus</hi> inſtead of inſulting over his Enemies miſery, was as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as any to contribute towards his releaſement, and at <hi>Ferrara</hi> was a League of moſt of the Chriſtian Princes concluded againſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to this very intent.</p>
            <p>No man queſtioned but the Duke in this action had for ever ſecured to
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:93968:128"/>
himſelf an intereſt in <hi>Clement,</hi> who by his Legate offered to renounce all his pretenſions upon <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio,</hi> and to renew the inveſtiture of <hi>Ferrara</hi> as ſoon as ſhe ſhould be ſet at liberty; yet all was preſently forgot; and the only advantage the Duke had by this League was the match then made up betwixt his Son <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Renata, Lewis</hi> the twelfths younger Daughter, who proved the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Princeſs in all reſpects that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Italy</hi> ſaw.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other things, <hi>Clement</hi> had promiſed upon the death of Cardinal <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> the Biſhoprick of <hi>Modena</hi> to the Dukes ſecond Son <hi>Hippolytus;</hi> but it was given away to a Son of one of the Emperours Chief Favourites, purpoſely that the Duke by diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the buſineſs might draw upon himſelf the Emperours Indignation, if not his Arms: Other ſubtle Arts were uſed by <hi>Clement</hi> to ruine the Dukes Intereſt at that Court, yet to no effect, for when <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth came to <hi>Bologna,</hi> the Duke did fully ſatisfie him of the Juſtice of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings with <hi>Clement;</hi> and the Popes

            <p>AN Expreſs was immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched by the Dutcheſs to her Son <hi>Alphonſus</hi> then at the Court of <hi>France,</hi> who making what haſt he could to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> took ſhip, and had a quick paſſage to <hi>Legorn,</hi> where <hi>Coſmus</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence</hi> with many of the <hi>Toſcan</hi> Nobility were ready to welcome him, and ſaw him ſafe in his own Territories.

            </p>
            <p>The Dutcheſs Dowager having no comfort in her ſtay in <hi>Italy</hi> after her Husbands death, returned to her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey, from which ſhe had been ſo many years abſent; and left all <hi>Ferrara,</hi> except the Jeſuits, in tears for the loſs of ſo incomparable
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:93968:134"/>
a Princeſs. The Gentry when ſhe firſt came thither, conſidering her as <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth's Daughter, bred up in the moſt glorious Court of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> where Princes of the blood, eſpecially the Kings Children could not have too much reſpect pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, expected to be kept at a greater diſtance now than they had been under the former Dutcheſſes; but on the contrary, acceſs to her was ſo eaſie, her converſation ſo free, and her whole deportment ſo modeſt, that had ſhe been the Daughter of a little Duke of <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> or an <hi>Euſtochia Laura</hi> raiſed by her virtue, ſhe could not have taken leſs ſtate upon her: All the Learned found the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effects of her Patronage, and were as liberal in ſetting out her Virtues, as ſhe could be towards their ſupport: The Poor and the Sick were ſure of relief, and Orphans of care and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. So that in the whole City of <hi>Ferrara</hi> there was ſcarce a perſon, that could not ſhew ſome inſtance of that unlimited goodneſs which had ſo long time diffuſed it ſelf upon all her ſubjects without miſſing rich or poor.</p>

Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> after his return from <hi>France,</hi> whither he went to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Dutcheſs his Mother, was created Cardinal; and while the joy of his promotion filled the Court with Balls and Banquets, the death of the Dutcheſs <hi>Lucretia</hi> changed the ſcene: ſhe had lived but fourteen months with her Husband, and had left him childleſs; yet this was in ſome meaſure repaired by the birth of <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Son of <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> in whom the Duke could not want a Succeſſor.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Hippolytus</hi> had been Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate in <hi>France,</hi> and returning thence with the Cardinal of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and many <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Noblemen, they were all treated at his Nephews Court, where at the ſame time there happened to be ſeveral other Princes; and then it was that <hi>Hippolytus</hi> play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Cards, with a vaſt ſumm at ſtake, and all the good Cards in his hand, made a hard ſhift to loſe, whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering to one of his Confidents, who ſeeing his hand ſeemed ſurprized, that he was more a Gentleman than to win ſo much money of ſtrangers at the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:93968:135"/>
Court of <hi>Ferrara;</hi> but if he had ſuch luck in <hi>France</hi> or at <hi>Rome,</hi> he knew how to make the beſt of it.</p>
            <p>The Duke was eaſily reconciled to a ſecond marriage, when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Maximilian</hi> proffered him the Princeſs <hi>Barbara</hi> his Daughter; the Cardinal <hi>Lewis</hi> went to meet her at <hi>Trent,</hi> and brought her to <hi>Ferrara</hi> with all the ſtate that either the Princes of <hi>Eſté,</hi> or that City could ſhew upon ſo ſolemn an occaſion. The War in <hi>Hungary</hi> growing hot with the <hi>Turk, Maximilian</hi> invited the Chriſtian Princes to his aſſiſtance, and thither went the Duke of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> with fifteen hundred Horſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent the Officers of his Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold before with the Baggage: ſoon after their arrival in the Imperial Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, <hi>Solymans</hi> death put an end to the War. This Expedition was very chargeable to the Duke, for beſides the length of the march, he had three hundred Gentlemen cloathed in Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet richly embroidered, with Servants all in the ſame Livery; the reſt alſo were ſo finely accoutered, that they ſeemed rather deſigned for a Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:93968:136"/>
than an Army; his zeal how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and his magnificence in this great appearance was ſo much taken notice of, that ſome years after they named him in <hi>Poland</hi> among the Princes who were Candidates for that Crown; and it was thought, if <hi>Maximilian</hi> had not in vain deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it for himſelf, he might have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it for his Son in Law the Duke of <hi>Ferrara.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke having no concerns at <hi>Rome</hi> for three or four reigns, which therefore I paſs in ſilence, ſpent his time in entertaining all the Princes that came that way, and in divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf. Great complaints were brought him of the Countrey peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anno Chriſti </seg>1570</label> ſpoiling his Game at a diſtance from the Court, which made all the penal Laws againſt ſuch abuſes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed; but they continuing ſtill to tranſgreſs, truſting either that they ſhould not be diſcovered, or if they were, that the Duke would not be rigid, a more effectual courſe was found out: for ſeveral high-way-men being ſentenced for other crimes to die, were ordered to be hanged up
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:93968:136"/>
in thoſe fields, ſome with Partridges, ſome with Pheaſants, ſome with Hares about their legs, the Dukes Officers giving out that they were put to death for killing ſuch.

            <p>The Dutcheſs <hi>Barbara</hi> being dead, the Duke was again married to a Daughter of <hi>Mantoua;</hi> but there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no hopes of Children by any, he began to look upon <hi>Caeſar,</hi> the Son <label type="milestone">

<pb n="240" facs="tcp:93968:137"/>
after died <hi>Lewis</hi> the Cardinal to the great grief of the Duke his Brother, and this grief was not digeſted when he had news from <hi>Blois</hi> of the fatal deaths of the Duke and Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> whoſe Mother was the Dukes Eldeſt Siſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Italy</hi> had been a conſiderable time without War, but the <hi>Bandito</hi>'s were now grown more terrible than any Enemy; eſpecially in <hi>Romagna,</hi> where liſting themſelves in three Companies, above ſix hundred in all, they put the whole Countrey under Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, they had the impudence to erect Judicatures, try men for their Lives, give Paſſports, and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, impoſe Taxes, and to act by a Soveraign Power they had aſſumed to themſelves; they mocked all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, eſpecially the Pope, upon whom they lay heavieſt; and when ever thoſe of Religious Orders were brought before them, they would have them fall down and worſhip them: If any Town failed to ſend them what they required, within a few dayes it was ſure to ſmart for it; for they being all deſperate <hi>Bandito</hi>'s

The Court of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> though very ancient, yet may be ſaid to have received its firſt Luſtre from the Marqueſs <hi>Nicolaus,</hi> before <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> the fourth kept his Council there. <hi>Leonel</hi> did endeavour to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his Father; but <hi>Borſius</hi> his ſecond Son, and the firſt Duke, raiſed things to a higher pitch, and became famous all <hi>Europe</hi> over for the greatneſs in which he lived. <hi>Hercules</hi> the firſt, with his Dutcheſs <hi>Leonora</hi> of <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> added every thing that was Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile at the Court of <hi>Naples,</hi> making <hi>Ferrara</hi> not only a Court fit for Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, as it was in the time of <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi>

who lived ſingle, but for Ladies alſo: under <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the firſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his conſtant War, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the former ſtate was loſt. And when <hi>Hercules</hi> the ſecond brought his Dutcheſs <hi>Renata</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> the alterations ſhe made were much for the better: But the late Duke did yet outdo thoſe that went before him, rendering his Court an Epitome of whatever was fine or great in <hi>France, Germany</hi> or <hi>Italy.</hi> Princes came long journeys on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſee it, and by all their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, though ſome Courts might be greater, yet none in other reſpects did come near that of <hi>Ferrara.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was it an empty ſhew; for with that noble entertainment ſuch as <hi>Italy</hi> has not ſince ſeen for ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of all qualities, ſome thouſands of poor had their daily maintenance thence: The young Gentlemen of Quality were at ſuch an age received into the number of the Dukes Pages, and bred up to all manner of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe beyond any Academy of the world; and owing their Education to their Prince, for the moſt part
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:93968:139"/>
they dedicated their lives to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, either being entertained as Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of his Houſehold, as Captains of his Guards, as Governours of his Caſtles; or employed as Miniſters in foreign Courts, where the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of <hi>Ferrara</hi> in their Equipage and behaviour gave ſtrangers ſome notion of the place from whence they came. None of the Dukes Subjects that excelled in any thing needed go to a foreign Court for want of encouragement at home; and Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier <hi>Guarini</hi> the Author of <hi>Paſtor Fido,</hi> who raſhly engaged himſelf to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> much repented him of his change, but could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>again be reſtored to his Countrey, or to the favour of his Prince, who thought himſelf affronted by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.

               <p>The pretended devolution of the Dutchy of <hi>Ferrara, Clement</hi> the eighths man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding with Duke <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and his retirement to <hi>Modena.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHen the death of <hi>Alphonſus</hi> was known at <hi>Rome,</hi> it was preſently given out there, that the Dutchy of <hi>Ferrara</hi> came by devolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Pope, becauſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Dukes Father the Son of <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> the firſt, was not as they falſely pretended at <hi>Rome,</hi> begot in lawfull wedlock, nor <hi>Laura Euſtochia</hi> whom we upon good grounds call <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>'s third Dutcheſs, ever married to him: That which gave the riſe to this report was the familiarity obſerved betwixt the Duke and this Lady be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they owned a marriage, and their having been married privately without any of the formalities ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by Princes upon ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. This <hi>Alphonſus</hi> did to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour his Son <hi>Hercules</hi> by his former Dutcheſs, who had no kindneſs for
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:93968:141"/>
the Lady <hi>Laura;</hi> and therefore he gave too much way afterwards to this falſe report, being angry likewiſe with her Sons, his younger Brothers, becauſe his greatneſs was impaired by the loſs of the Lands, and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Juriſdictions beſtowed upon them by <hi>Alphonſus.</hi> But to clear a matter of ſuch importance, and to do Juſtice to one of the moſt Illuſtrious Races in the world, I have at the end of this Hiſtory ſet down in <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> what was offered in writing to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the eighth by the preſent Duke of <hi>Modena</hi>'s Grand-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, who if he had lived was likely enough to have made good his Title to <hi>Ferrara</hi> by his Sword, as well as his Pen; being the ſtouteſt Prince, and greateſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Italy</hi> in our age. To the Dukes own words then as of unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable Authority, I refer the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Reader, not doubting but they will ſatisfie others as much as they did my ſelf.</p>
            <p>The death of <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the ſecond being publiſhed, and the whole Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, Nobility and Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:93968:141"/>
of the People being aſſembled, the Judge of the twelve <hi>Savii,</hi> after having condoled the loſs of the late Duke, commanded his Will to be read openly; and then according to the ancient cuſtom of that City, asked them if they were not willing to have <hi>Don Caeſar</hi> of <hi>Eſté</hi> the Grandchild of <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the firſt, and the Teſtators Couſin German, for their Prince, to which all did anſwer in the affirmative, and with great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of joy declared <hi>Caeſar</hi> Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> &amp;c. Next morning in a ſolemn manner they came to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace to pay their homage to their New Duke, who ſitting upon a Throne in his Ducal habit, received them, and the Judge of the <hi>Savii</hi> kneeling before the Throne, did in the name of all the reſt deliver him the Sword and Scepter: Then <hi>Caeſar</hi> with his Ducal Crown upon his head coming out of his Palace, and taking Horſe in the great Piazza, having the Ambaſſador of <hi>Florence</hi> upon his right hand, and the Judge of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vii</hi> upon his left, the Marqueſs of <hi>Bentivoglio,</hi> carrying the naked Sword
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:93968:142"/>
before him, began his Cavalcade through the City: all the ſtreets as he paſt, ecchoing, with <hi>Long live Caeſar Duke of Ferrara;</hi> the Cavalcade end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the great Church, where after High Maſs, the Judge did adminiſter him his Coronation Oath, and then <hi>Te Deum</hi> being ſung, he returned to his Palace.</p>
            <p>The ſolemnity being over, the Duke reſolved in Council to diſpatch Ambaſſadors to the Pope, the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> to the Republicks of <hi>Venice</hi> and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noua,</hi> and to the reſt of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> with an account of what had paſt: For theſe Embaſſies the Chief of the Nobility were deſigned, but afterwards he found his miſtake too late, when that to complement foreign Princes, he deprived himſelf of thoſe perſons, who for their Loyalty and Intereſt could have done him better ſervice at home in ſo critical a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture.</p>
            <p>Advice being brought to <hi>Rome</hi> of the Dukes Coronation, <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth, without expecting the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors arrival, gave order for a
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:93968:142"/>
Monitory to be immediately iſſued out, requiring the Duke within four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen dayes to render an account at <hi>Rome</hi> of the reaſons of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. The Duke by an expreſs to his Ambaſſador, endeavoured to divert the Pope from this violent courſe, by ſuſpending his Monitory, or at leaſt by granting him longer time in a matter of that conſequence; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering moreover to refer the whole difference betwixt him and the Pope, either to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or any other Prince, whom <hi>Clement</hi> ſhould think fit to pitch upon: Moſt perſons thought the Pope would readily have complyed with ſo reaſonable a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, which yet he could by no means be brought to hearken to, but diſmiſt the Ambaſſador without any hopes of an accommodation.</p>
            <p>After the Ambaſſadors departure, the Pope called a Conſiſtory, that he might have the advice of his Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, before he proceeded further in what concerned the Apoſtolical Sea ſo near; there the Cardinals did much differ in their Opinions, ſome by a faint compliance with what they
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:93968:143"/>
judged the Pope enelined to, were for his going on immediately, both with his ſpiritual and temporal arms againſt the Duke; others looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this as a method not ſo ſuitable to the Apoſtolical See, where nothing of precipitancy ought to take place; and therefore gave their judgment that his Holineſs was never to have recourſe to ſuch ſevere remedies, till ſuch time as it appeared the Duke was not to be wrought upon by gentler means. But thoſe who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood what fair proffers were made by the Ambaſſador of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> did diſapprove of violent courſes at any rate; being of opinion, that the Pope had better wave his pretenſions to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> than by excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Duke, to enter into a War, and ſo kindle a fire in <hi>Italy</hi> which would not eaſily be quenched: they urged that the City of <hi>Ferrara</hi> was well fortified and peopled, and that no Princes were ever more beloved of their Subjects than thoſe of <hi>Eſté,</hi> whom undoubtedly they would not eaſily be brought to part with. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides they had reaſon to believe the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:93968:143"/>
Duke had made ſure of his Allies, and of all thoſe who were already jealous of the Popes greatneſs; whereas on the contrary, they could think of none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> that would declare in favour of the Pope.</p>
            <p>The Pope ſeeing the Cardinals ſo much divided broke up the Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry without coming to any reſolution; but while he was doubtfull within himſelf, whether it were better to proceed in his undertaking, or to give it quite over, one of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals having obtained a private Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, told him, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the difficulties propoſed in the Conſiſtory, yet if his Holineſs would vouchſafe to follow his advice, <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara</hi> ſhould undoubtedly fall into his hands without putting him to much expence, either of money or of blood. <hi>I confeſs,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>the City of</hi> Ferrara <hi>is ſtrong and well peopled, and that the Prince is there generally beloved more than any where elſe in</hi> Italy, <hi>which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may diſcourage your Holineſs from making good your Title; yet I queſtion not but by the diſcreet management of ſome perſon of credit and interest at
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:93968:144"/>
that Court, in whom you may confide, many of the Dukes friends may be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his most ſecret Councils revealed, and the City it ſelf made glad to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your Holineſs. We know,</hi> ſayes the Cardinal, <hi>how</hi> Ferrara <hi>abounds with Nobility, whoſe Fortunes are nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rower than their minds, and who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not all expect preferment at that Court; beſides there are queſtionleſs ſome there, as about all Courts, who are angry with the Government, not thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves conſidered according to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon ſuch ambitious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented ſpirits large promiſes made in your Holineſſes name, will be ſure to work, ſuch muſt be made ſenſible of the happy exchange from a private Prince to a Pope, in whoſe power it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Virtuous, and thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his favour, with the highest dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, ſubjects are capable of; and how thoſe who are immediately under the Church, have much the advantage of all others in their pretenſions at</hi> Rome. <hi>And when the perſon,</hi> ſayes the Cardinal <hi>thus employed can ſhew his Authority for what he promiſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Holineſſes hand and ſeal, they
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:93968:144"/>
will ſtrive to out-do one another in their zeal to promote your ſervice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pope did heartily approve of this project, and as ſoon as the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal was gone, the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor came to aſſure the Pope in his Maſters Name, That he was reſolved to declare for him, and to fall upon thoſe who ſhould appear in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Duke of <hi>Ferrara. Henry</hi> the fourth renouncing the Reformed Religion, had reconciled himſelf to <hi>Rome</hi> ſome time before, and thought this a fit occaſion to expreſs his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned zeal for the Church, which many ſtill queſtioned: But truly his abandoning thus the Houſe of <hi>Eſté,</hi> which had for many ages adhered ſo ſtedfaſtly to the Intereſts of <hi>France,</hi> did little raiſe his reputation any where, except at <hi>Rome;</hi> nor doth this deſerve to be recorded by Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity among thoſe Heroick Actions, which have got him the Name of <hi>Henry the Great.</hi> In ſhort, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals ſubtile advice ſeconded by the hopes of aſſiſtance from <hi>France</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <hi>Clement</hi> in his former reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſetting all expedients a foot
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:93968:145"/>
to turn Duke <hi>Caeſar</hi> out of <hi>Ferrara.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke renew'd his inſtances, either to have the matter in conteſt referr'd to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or at leaſt to have a competent time allow'd him to ſum up his reaſons, in which he was confident, not only to ſatisfie all indifferent perſons, but even the Pope himſelf; but at <hi>Rome</hi> it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that neither reference nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhould now take place; and that the Duke, for not complying with the Monitory, though it required of him things impoſſible, was forthwith to be excommunicated. That the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication might give the ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter blow, Colonels and Officers were named, and Forces raiſed to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Duke: there was alſo a great deal of money coin'd with the Arms of <hi>Aldobrandin</hi> upon the one ſide; and upon the other was a ſmall ſhip toſt by the waves, and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> ſitting at the Helm, with this Motto in Latine, <hi>Non praevalebunt, They ſhall not prevail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke being inform'd of all that paſt publickly, but ignorant of the ſecret practices againſt him, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:93968:145"/>
immediately a famous Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to <hi>Rome,</hi> who undertook to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſuch as the Pope ſhould appoint to hear him: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that the Princes of <hi>Eſté</hi> never held <hi>Ferrara</hi> of the Church as a feudal City, by proving which he removed one of the chief pillars of its pretended devolution. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the firſt, Duke <hi>Caeſars</hi> Grand-father, was married to the Lady <hi>Laura Euſtochia,</hi> of which he brought moſt unqueſtionable te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies; and this removed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objection againſt the Dukes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: but the Excommunication being now drawn up, and the Forces already upon their march, there was nothing more to be done by way of Treaty; ſo that the Duke was at length forced to have recourſe to his Arms for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Juſtice of his Cauſe: hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore called the Magiſtrates, and the Chief of the Nobility toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he gave them an account what endeavours he had uſed, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsfully to ſweeten the Pope, and prevent a rupture, that now being neceſſitated to take Arms in his own defence, he hoped all of them would
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:93968:146"/>
concur, and not ſuffer the Princes of <hi>Eſté,</hi> under whoſe auſpicious Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they and their Anceſtors had for many ages enjoy'd ſo great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, to be violently and unjuſtly thruſt out of their Native Countrey; then the method of carrying on the War being ſet down, every one ſeemed chearfully to undertake ſome part of the charge and danger, tho' in effect, the Popes Emiſſaries had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready laid the train according to the Cardinals project; and the Duke had now no greater Enemies than ſome of thoſe who were moſt in his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>Upon the news of the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications being publiſhed at <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſent by the Army towards <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy;</hi> the Duke ſent once more to <hi>Clement,</hi> expoſtulating about his ill u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and entreating him to conſider how hard it was to haſten ſo ſevere a ſentence, without firſt allowing time and appointing Judges (as he had moſt earneſtly decreed) to hear his reaſons. And, laſt of all, he modeſtly laid before him how little it would be for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Apoſtolical See for his
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:93968:146"/>
Holineſs to proceed after this manner in an affair wholly temporal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he himſelf was both Judge and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which made the Duke ſtill hope, that upon cooler thoughts he would think fit to put a ſtop to the Sentence before it were publiſhed in <hi>Lombardy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Excommunication notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Dukes endeavours, being publiſhed at <hi>Bologna,</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, order was given to keep ſtrict watch at all the Gates of the City, where every perſon who entered was to be examined and ſearched, leſt it ſhould be brought to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and affixed by night upon the great Church: and people being now in a general conſternation, betwixt the news of the Sentence which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt in the moſt dreadfull terms, and of the Popes Army, which was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing towards them, Father <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> a Jeſuit, with the wonted aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of thoſe of his Order, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Audience of the Duke, and after having made a grave diſcourſe, like a Divine, of the great danger of being cut off from the Communion of the Church, and of forfeiting all thoſe
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:93968:147"/>
priviledges that Chriſtians enjoy, he put on the perſon of a Stateſman, and ſhewed the Duke how unreaſonable it was for him to think of reſiſting the Papal Power, with which few Kings were able to graple; he put him in mind that he had not to do with him who bore S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Peters</hi> Keyes only, but alſo his Sword; that the Pope was no inconſiderable Prince in what immediately belonged to the Church; and that beſides this, he had a party in all other Princes Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and Courts, and could never be ſuppoſed to want aſſiſtance from abroad more than other Princes could reaſonably promiſe themſelves, and therefore upon the whole matter, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter great proteſtations of kindneſs for his Highneſs, and his moſt ſerene Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, he conjured him, not to ſtand out, concluding that the circumſtances in which the Duke then was, obliged him to follow his advice, becauſe thoſe whom he moſt truſted were ready upon occaſion to betray him: that there was a deſign alſo upon his other Dominions, and that he was ſure the Pope wanted not friends at
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:93968:147"/>
               <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who, if the buſineſs were not ſoon accommodated, would at length compaſs their ends in the Dukes ruine.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Palma</hi> was gone, the Duke began to reflect upon what he had ſaid, eſpecially upon the latter part of his diſcourſe, which he thought was not to be ſlighted, having reaſon to believe, that none knew more of the deſigns afoot againſt him, than that good Father and the reſt of his Order. Whereupon growing jealous, leſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> and <hi>Regio</hi> might be loſt, while he laboured in vain to preſerve <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> a ſudden reſolution was taken to part with it, and the Dutcheſs of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin</hi> was forthwith employ'd to go and treat with the Popes Nephew, Cardinal <hi>Aldobrandin.</hi> The Articles were too ſoon agreed on, but might have been much more for the Dukes advantage, had he pitched upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Plenipotentiary than the Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs, who moſt palpably ſacrificed his concerns to ſecure her own. The Duke having according to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſign'd the Government into the hands of the Magiſtrates, and ſent
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:93968:148"/>
the Prince his Son hoſtage to <hi>Bolog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> for the performance of the other Articles, made what haſt he could to retire to <hi>Modena,</hi> for he now began to hate <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and that upon good grounds: <hi>Don Mario Farneſe</hi> ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Cardinal, having plainly ſhew'd him, that all his ſecrets had been revealed, and the manner of ſeizing on his Dominions concerted by many of thoſe about him, as Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there produced under their hands and ſeals did teſtifie, and that the City was to have been delivered to the Popes Army within a few dayes, had not the Duke prevented them by a voluntary ſurrender.</p>

of the Inhabitants, who depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Court, wanted bread; in a few months many of the ſhops were ſhut up, and the Tradeſmen forced to go into other Cities, not being longer able to maintain their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies there, the Nobility found their condition very comfortleſs, and thoſe who had betrayed the Duke in hopes of preferment were juſtly diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their expectations: the New Government with new Cuſtoms and heavy Taxes, brought in ſtrangers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to moſt of the good Offices which the Natives enjoyed under their Dukes; ſo that even thoſe who were moſt for a change, if they had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen what was to come, would all, as one man, have ſacrificed their lives in the Dukes defence. <hi>Modena</hi> upon the other hand growing every day more populous and rich, became ſoon ſenſible of the benefit of a Court, for what was raiſed by Taxes ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lent, being repay'd oftentimes with intereſt by the Dukes expences among them: beſides the Nobility who formerly gave their attendance at <hi>Ferrara</hi> ſpent all their Rents now

                  <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth who was then Pope, being deceived by this ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of reaſon, took upon him to proceed againſt the perſon of Duke <hi>Caeſar,</hi> not only by monitories and cenſures, but alſo by making War, by bringing numerous Armies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and by ſubtile practices, working him alſo what miſchief he could in his other Territories, which he held of none but the Sacred <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire: inſomuch that Duke <hi>Caeſar</hi> not being able to deal with ſo powerfull an Adverſary, and being moved with a juſt fear, parted with the poſſeſſion of that Dutchy as he did.</p>
               <p>That Don <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the Father of Duke <hi>Caeſar</hi> was legitimate by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage which followed betwixt Duke <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the firſt his Father, and the Lady <hi>Laura Euſtochia</hi> his Mother, the following proofs make moſt evident.</p>
               <p>The teſtimony of Hiſtorians (whoſe credit in ſuch caſes we uſe, and ought highly to value and regard, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly when they are many) leave no ground to doubt of the Marriage: and to ſpeak the truth, how can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:93968:157"/>
that the pens of ſo many, and of ſo famous Writers, ſhould; to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of their reputation, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to publiſh a thing notoriouſly falſe, while they could ſo eaſily have been convicted of a lye? Nor is it to be ſuppoſed that out of flattery, or a deſign to promote their own fortunes, by bettering other mens condition, they would have condeſcended to publiſh a falſehood, ſeeing there was not at that time the leaſt appearance of this ſucceſſion, the four Sons of the former Dutcheſs <hi>Lucretia Borgia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then alive.</p>

and extraordinary prudence, by whom he begot two <hi>Alphonſus</hi>'s.</q> Words moſt plain, and which prove not only the Marriage, but alſo the Sons he had, one of whom was <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus</hi> that we now mention. This Writer was a Fryar, a Subject of the Church, and Contemporary with Duke <hi>Alphonſus:</hi> he had occaſion to be informed of the truth of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; and if paſſion could at all have by aſſed him, it is to be believed he would not have written for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but againſt it.</p>

                  </q>By which we clearly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that Duke <hi>Alphonſus</hi> after
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:93968:158"/>
he had got two Sons by her, being charmed with the ſingular Virtue of the Lady <hi>Laura,</hi> took her for his Wife.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To the above-mentioned Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we muſt likewiſe add that of <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Scot,</hi> a Doctor of great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and that writ alſo near thoſe Times, who while he endeavours to prove, <hi>Conſ. 4. numb.</hi> 17, and 18. <hi>Tom.</hi>

2. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. That a Prince may make preſents to his Wife, brings for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance the preſents made to the Lady <hi>Laura</hi> when ſhe was married to Duke <hi>Alphonſus</hi> in theſe very words, <q>I could give an example in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents ſent by <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the firſt, Duke of <hi>Ferrara</hi> to the Lady <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> his third Wife, and the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Beretarius</hi> whom the Duke married in performance of his vow.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nor do the depoſitions of many Witneſſes that were examined in a legal manner ſince the loſs of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi> and which are ſtill kept on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, differ from the Hiſtorians Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony: From whence a publick report and fame of the marriage we ſpeak of is evidently proved, and ſome there were ready to take oath that they had ſeen the Lady <hi>Laura</hi> treated by the Duke himſelf with that honour and reſpect which are only due to a Wife: to this they add that ſhe enjoy'd Prerogatives which were ſutable to none but a Princeſs: ſhe was generally reſpected as ſuch, not only by her Subjects, but likewiſe
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:93968:159"/>
by foreign Princes, and was by all treated with the name of the Houſe of <hi>Eſté;</hi> which ſirname ſhe alwayes took in all publick and private wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as doth ſtill appear by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Authentick Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Priviledges, Orders, Letters, Commiſſions, and the like.</p>
               <p>She made uſe of a Seal with the Arms of the Princes of <hi>Eſté</hi> in her Orders and Letters, ſhe ſpoke in the plural number <hi>[We:]</hi> It was her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom when ſhe went abroad to have Gentlemen before, and Ladies in Coach behind her. And as an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that favourable fortune, which from her low Condition had exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to that pitch of greatneſs, ſhe had engraved upon her Coach a Sun with this Motto, <hi>For he who is great has magnified me:</hi> and the Duke her Husband alluding to the ſame, had Money coined, of which very many pieces are ſtill to be ſeen, where our Saviour is ſitting, and a woman at his feet, with theſe words, <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole;</hi> which was a moſt manifeſt ſign that he had exalted her to the eminent ſtation of a Wife.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:93968:160"/>
All the time ſhe ſurvived her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ſhe went in the habit of a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, which ſhe had not done, had ſhe not been one. From the Honours and Prerogatives ſhe enjoyed in her life, the ſaid witneſſes paſs to the reſpects which were pay'd her at her death; and they averr, that Duke <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the ſecond, and Cardinal <hi>Lewis</hi> his Brother, with a train of the whole Court did ſolemnly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company her to the place of burial, the Duke honouring the Funeral with mourning, and the Cardinal with the Cloaths which ſuch Princes uſe to wear upon the death of their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The whole Court put on mourning, and as the cuſtom is, they did hang out the Arms of the ſaid Lady quartered with thoſe of the Princes of <hi>Eſté,</hi> one of which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the teſtimony of the ſame witneſſes is ſtill preſerved: To whom elſe could honours and reſpects of this kind agree, but to the Dukes Wife? and how could ever Duke <hi>Alphonſus</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Lewis</hi> who were Princes, that in their carriage obſerved alwayes a ſtate and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:93968:160"/>
ſutable to their quality, ever have ſuffered, much leſs contributed by their preſence towards her being treated after this manner, if they had not really own'd her for a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of their Family?</p>
               <p>Finally, there are two Authentick Inſtruments verified by all the forms of Law, which remove all manner of difficulty, and were with great earneſtneſs required and made by a Notary in <hi>Ferrara,</hi> the one in the year 1550, and the other in 1551. The very words for what concerns the marriage do agree and are the ſame, as they are here ſet down.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The moſt Illuſtrious Lady, the Lady <hi>Laura Euſtochia,</hi> Wife of the moſt Illuſtrious and Excellent Duke <hi>Alphonſus,</hi> late Duke of <hi>Ferrara, Modena</hi> and <hi>Regio,</hi> &amp;c.</q> And yet <hi>Hercules</hi> the ſecond was then alive, who having no kindneſs, as every one knows, for the Lady <hi>Laura</hi> and her Sons, would never have ſuffer'd that ſhe ſhould have been falſely ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured in publick writings with ſuch like Titles as theſe.</p>
               <p>And with thoſe abovementioned
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:93968:161"/>
there is another ancient Inſtrument, which agrees with it thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The moſt Illuſtrious and moſt Excellent Lady <hi>Laura</hi> of <hi>Eſté,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lict of the late moſt Illuſtrious and Excellent Prince <hi>Alphonſus</hi> of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed memory Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> &amp;c. being perſonally preſent.</q> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the matter now in hand, we muſt conſider that here we treat of a buſineſs of ſome antiquity, in which not only evident proofs, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe preſumptive and conjectural ones, ſuch as theſe are, muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd; and the rather, becauſe we do not enquire now into the truth of the marriage for the marriage it ſelf, but only to make the Succeſſion Legitimate for poſterity, in which caſe ſlighter proofs may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter admitted. Nor is it of ſmall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the ſaid marriage was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized before the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> becauſe then ſo many formalities were not required, and the Orders that were made in that moſt holy aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, were for regulating future mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and not thoſe that were paſt, as it has been often declared in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:93968:161"/>
Supreme Judicatures, nor would the Original Inſtrument of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage be wanting, which was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and made by <hi>John Baptiſta Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rachi</hi> a Notary in <hi>Ferrara,</hi> if this and other papers relating to the ſame affair had not been withdrawn by Duke <hi>Hercules</hi> for the grudge he bore (as we have already hinted) to the two <hi>Alphonſus</hi>'s his Brothers, both upon the account of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sons of another Mother, and becauſe he obſerved that his and their Father Duke <hi>Alphonſus</hi> loved them ſo very tenderly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon granted them free and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Feuds, and conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues: Nevertheleſs by Divine Providence, ſo many proofs ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as are ſufficient to diſcover the truth.</p>
               <p>Moreover his Imperial Majeſty <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> the ſecond being wrought upon by theſe motives, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Don <hi>Alphonſus</hi> was really le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate by the Marriage that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, not only declared the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which was given out to the contrary by ill affected perſons, to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:93968:162"/>
be vain, but did grant alſo the Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiture of the Imperial Territories to me, not as the Succeſſor ſimply of Duke <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the ſecond, but as to a Prince named and comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ancient Inveſtitures of my Progenitors.</p>
               <p>And that it may not appear his Majeſty was moved to do this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having firſt weighed well the buſineſs, he accompanies his Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with the very words that follow, that he declared this, <q>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deliberated well upon it, and having taken ſound and mature ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice about it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Marriage being then proved by the credit of ſo many Hiſtorians, by the teſtimony of ſo famous a Lawyer, by the depoſition of Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that the Lady <hi>Laura</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes treated as the Dukes Wife during her Life, and at her Death, by Titles, Subſcriptions, Seals, Arms, Habit; and laſtly, by the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Declaration: It neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows then, that the pretence of the devolution of <hi>Ferrara</hi> is overthrown, becauſe the Marriage being thus
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:93968:162"/>
proved, it cannot be queſtioned but the Children who are by this means Legitimate, are really lawfull, and therefore capable of ſucceeding to any eſtate whatſoever.</p>
