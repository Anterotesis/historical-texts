            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

my Real self as Modest Mr. <hi>Ievon</hi> the Player. But

of <hi>Endor,</hi> were she alive instead of her; I am link'd to an Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zonian
Devil, such a <hi>Thalestris,</hi> such a perpetual Fixen, and a
Shrew, such a Tongue, that 'twould be a Blessing to be lodged in
<hi>London,</hi> with a Silver-Smith under me, a Brazier over head, a
Trunk-maker and a Peuterer on either side of me, and all of 'em
Industrious Rogues to boot; a Blessing I say in Comparison of her
continual Clamour, all those Noises in consort are soft and gentle
Harmony to her one single Voice.</p>

I was in Paradise, upon a Bed of Roses, and of Violets,
and the sweetest Husband by my side; sure it was a Dream, Ha!
where am I now? bless us! what sweets are these about me? no
Garden in the Spring can equal them, not Buds of Roses with the
Dew upon them, am I upon a Bed? the Sheets are Sarcenet
sure; no Linnen ever was so fine, what a gay silken Robe have I
gotten? Oh Heaven I dream! I dream nothing but Point and Lace,
and Gold, and Fringe. Oh let me never wake! nothing but Gold,
fine Works and Carving: oh Father what a Glass is there! there's
a sumptuous Carpet upon the Table and silver Plate, sure I dy'd
to night in my sleep, and am gone to Heaven and this is it!</p>

               <p>Hold, hold good Husband, I'll try what I can do?</p>

               <speaker>To the People.</speaker>
               <p>Oh most curious fine Gentlefolks, I hope you will
pardon me for being so bold, but ne're stir, I'll never let you alone
till I find you kind to poor <hi>Zekel,</hi> for he's as pretty a Fellow as
e're strapp'd Wife.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Mr. <hi>Ievon.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>Why how now, what a Pox is all this for? what
speak an Epilogue in Prose? (the Devil) I cou'd have done that
my self you foolish Jade. For example now,</p>
               <stage>Addresses himself to the Audience, and makes a long
Banter, and goes off, after that he speaks.</stage>
               <p>Look you Huzwife, there's as good Prose as any is in <hi>England,</hi> but
I must have it in Verse, all beaten Verse, away with it.</p>

               <l>YOV cannot sure ungenerously refuse,</l>
               <l>The first address of a young tender muse;</l>
               <l>So modest that she ne're attempts to fly,</l>
               <l>Vp to the lofty pitch of Comedy:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:55545:34"/>
Farce is her aim, the persons low and mean,</l>
               <l>Humble the language homely it the seene.</l>
               <l>Let this poor shrub secure from censure grow,</l>
               <l>For all the Critiques stormy rage too low:</l>
               <l>If you'l your thundering indignation vent,</l>
               <l>Let it on lofty bumbast all be spent.</l>
               <l>Applauded nonsence where sad lovers pine,</l>
               <l>And Hero's rant and fight and cry and whine;</l>
               <l>And the old buskins empty swelling strains,</l>
               <l>That cracks the Player's lungs and Poet's brains.</l>
               <l>These, these are triumphs for your forces fit,</l>
               <l>But who upon a Droll e're spent his wit;</l>
               <l>Or crititiz'd on Merry <hi>Andrew</hi> yet?</l>
               <l>Whilst all the lofty Frigots you attacque,</l>
               <l>Pray let in safety pass this little smack.</l>
               <l>Your shot 'gainst us will wast 'ith empty sky,</l>
               <l>The whistling bullets o're our heads will flye;</l>
               <l>We lye so low your Canon mount too high.</l>
