            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Also Apostles &amp; there followers, keeping the rule youen to them of Christ, wonne most merit &amp; thankes of God in this keeping before al other times; therefore if al Christen men both in old time, and new hadden kept the same rule of Christ, in his owne cleannesse &amp; freedome, should haue deserued most thanks of God

Also hit were now as good, and of as much merit to keep the rule of Jesu Christ, as it was at the beginning; sith Christs rule is enough, and able for al men on liue of what euer complexion or age they ben of; but this rule was kept of Jesu Christ and his Apostles, &amp; there best sewers, by fiue hundred yeere after his Ascension, withouten anie finding of any such new planting, or religion, in which time holy Church encreased &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited most; for than almost al men disposed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome, at ensample of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore it were now not only meritory or medeful, but most medeful to the Church, to liue so in al things, and by al things.</p>

               <p>Also the Pope may dispence with the rule of ech priuat sect or religion, and hath dispenced &amp; yet doth but he maie not dispence with Christs rule youen to Apostles; therfore the rule of Christ ordained to Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, is more perfit, than any rule of of priuat religion, and most perfect of al, and hereof it sueth openly, that

Nothing owght to be damned as errour and false, but if it sauor errour or vnrightewisenes against Gods law: but neither the King, ne his Counsaile, dud vnrightfully, for as much as he tooke away the possessions of some Prelates, that trespaceden, whose contrary Friers han determined o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly; therefore reasonably men shoulde assent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to this axing.

               <p>Also if this bee errour touching the health of mans soule, than it is against holy writ, and than if a man su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine

For the chief Lordshippe in this lond of al Temporalties both of secular men &amp; Religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the King of his general gouerning; for els hee were not King of al England, but of a littel part therof. Therfore the men that bysien them to take awaie this Lordship fro the King, as don Friers &amp; there fautours in this point bene sharper enemies and traitours, than French men and al other nations.

Whereof it sueth plainely, that not onlie sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Priests and Curats, but also Soveraine Curats, as Bishops should not axe there subiects by constraining more than lifelode and heling, whan they done awaie al manner wast both of monie, and worldlie array.

For they saie that ech Bishop and Priest, maie lawfully leaue there first dignitie, and after be a <hi>Friar:</hi> But when he is once a <hi>Friar,</hi> hee maie in no manner leaue that, &amp; liue as a Bishop or a Priest by the forme of the Gospel. But this here sie saies that Christ lacked wit, might, or charitie, to teach Apostles and his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples the best Religion: But what man maie suffer this foule heresie to be put on Jesu Christ? Christian men saie, that the Religion and order that Christ made for his Disciples and Priests, is most perfit, most easie, and most siker. Most perfit, for this reason; for the Patron or Founder thereof is most perfit, for he is verie God and verie man, that of most wit and most charitie gaue this Religion to his deare-worthe friendes. Also the rule thereof is most perfit; sith the Gospel in his freedome withouten errour of man, is rule of this Religion. Also knights of this Religion bene most holie, and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. For Jesu Christ &amp; his Apostles bene chiefe knights thereof, and after them holy Martirs and Confessours. It is most easie &amp; light; for Christ himselfe saies; <hi>that his yoke is soft, and his charge is light,</hi> sith it stands all in loue and freedome of hart, &amp; bids nothing but reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:22751:15"/>
thing, and profitable for the keeper thereof. It is most siker; for it is confirmed of God, and not of sinful men, and no man may destroie it or dispense there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst: but if the Pope or anie man shalbe saued, hee mought be confirmed thereby, and els he shalbe dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. But men saien that other new orders &amp; Rules ben nowght worth, but if they ben confirmed of the Pope, and other sinful men, and then they bene not worth but if they bin confirmed of the diuel, and in case the Pope shalbe damned, for then he is a diuel, as the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel saies of <hi>Iudas;</hi> and thus men sayen, that Christs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in his owne cleannes and freedome, is more per fit then anie sinful mans religion, by as much as Christ is more perfit then is anie sinful man. And if newe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions sayen, that they keepen all that Christs religion bidds, they sparen the soth, for they lacken the freedo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e and measure of Christs Religion, and ben bounden to errours of sinful men, and therby bin letted to profite to Christian mens soules, &amp; not suffered to teach free lie Gods law, ne keepe it in themselfe.

               <p>ALso <hi>Friars</hi> sayn plainlie, that it is Apostasie and
 heresie for a Priest, to liue as Christ ordained a Priest to liue by forme of the Gospel. For if ther be anie <hi>Friar</hi> that is a Priest cunning in Gods law, and able to travel to sowe Gods words among the people, if he doe this office freely going fro countrie to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, wher he may most profit &amp; cease not, for <hi>Priour</hi> ne anie other Satrap, and charge not singular habite, and begge not, but be paied with common meat &amp; drinke as Christ and his Apostles were, they wil pursue him as Apostata, &amp; draw him to prison, &amp; saie that he is cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for this deed. For if this free going about, and free preaching is lawful to such a <hi>Friar,</hi> sith it is ensampled &amp; commanded of Christ, &amp; not to be closed in a Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, as it were Caymes Castle, and so <hi>Friars</hi> shoulden be nedid to leaue this liuing of Cloister and fained o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, by singular profession, and to dwel amonge the people to whom they maie most profite Ghostlie. For charitie ne did Christ and Baptist to come out of desart, to teach the Gospel to the people, til they were dead therfore, much more charitie showld driue <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars</hi> to come out amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst the people, &amp; leaue Caymes Castels that bin so needeles &amp; chargeous to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; sith they cannot occupie themself so wel in such solitarie life and contemplation, as couthen Christ &amp; <hi>Iohn Baptist.</hi> And to this same Christ ordained all his Apostles and Disciples, to liue an open good life, in mecknes and wilful pouertie, and discreet penance, to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:22751:16"/>
teach busilie his Gospel to the people, and not be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in great Cloisters and costly as Caymes Castels. And it seemes an ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doeing of Antichrist not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Priests freely to doe this office of Christ, but need them vppon paine of prisonning to be ruled in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the wil of a simple Idiot, and in case a damned diuel of hel, and so there leaues no meane to hold these sects together, but if it bee this blasphemie, to prison a man for as much as he does after the wil of God. And thus this newe profession is harmeful for manie skilles. For it is not ensampled of Christ, ne anie of his Apostles, &amp; he taught vs al that was needful and profitable. Also this profession serues of nowght, but if it bee to make fooles doe more after the errours of sinful men, then after the commaundement of God. For by virtue of Christs teaching, each man is holden to doe after each other, in as much as he teacheth Christ commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or counsel, &amp; more maie no man bind an other. Also Christ gaue his Disciples power of each worke, that turnes to profite of their soules, and help of other men, &amp; this freedome is letted by this professio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made to sinful men, and in case to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For it seemes that they maken themselues wiser then Christ more wittie and more ful of charitie, sith they teachen better way to heauen, then did Christ as they fainen.</p>
