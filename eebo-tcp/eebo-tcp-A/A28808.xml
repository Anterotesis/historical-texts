            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>A Womans Pen preſents you with a Play:</l>
            <l>Who ſmiling told me I'd be ſure to ſee,</l>
            <l>That once confirm'd, the Houſe wou'd empty be.</l>
            <l>Not one yet gone!—</l>
            <l>Well, I'l go tell her you are all ſo juſt,</l>
            <l>You'l laugh at her on Knowledg, not on Truſt.</l>
            <l>I know ſhe'l ſend me back, but what to do,</l>
            <stage>[He goes off.</stage>
            <l>When I have learn'd of her, I'l tell it you.</l>
            <stage>[Comes agen.</stage>
            <l>Gueſs now the Meſſage: ſhe prays ye to be gone,</l>
            <l>You'l croud her Wit to death in ſuch a Throng</l>
            <l>Of Wits, ſhe ſays, which no Conſumptions have,</l>
            <l>And hers is weak, e'en going to the grave.</l>
            <l>She wonders much that ye ſhould all deſire</l>
            <l>To ſtay, and witneſs when it does expire.</l>
            <stage>[One comes to him.</stage>

               <hi>Meſſ.</hi> Hark ye the Poeteſs does angry grow.</l>

            <l>With Ballading I think ſhe mad is grown,</l>
            <l>And by her Prologue fain would make it known.</l>
            <l>She need not be ſo hasty; faith her Play</l>

Fortune was Juſt, not blind, in giving him a Sceptre.

Nephew to the late Lord <hi>Euryalus,</hi> that was the fair <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celia's</hi>

                     <p>Why, juſt as I left you the other night, I met with
our new Favourite; and ſtraight my brain was ſeiz'd with
a piece of policy, to try if I could drink away his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
and keep ſo much of my own to play the Juſtice
of Peace with him, and ſift out the Reaſon of his ſo much
admir'd greatneſs with the King: but I, like other Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
fail'd in my Deſign, and made my ſelf as uncapable
of Queſtions, as he was of Anſwers. But that which makes
me the moſt mad, and will make thee the moſt merry, was,
<pb facs="tcp:57674:9"/>
that I muſt needs be ſhaking of my Elbow, and pay the firſt
Tribute to his fortune and ſucceſ in Gaming.</p>

ſince you would learn him to play, to teach him at your

Clergy, Stateſman, the Lawyer, the Citizen, poor and
rich, all ſtrive for his Friendſhip, his Counſel, his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;

to marry me becauſe I would not fight for her: No,
no, ſhe is not ſo ungodly, and loves me better then to
deſire I ſhould venture my life: Beſides, I never told her,
or ſaid ſuch a word, that I would kill my ſelf for her, or
kill any man for her, nor go to the Devil for her; and

to ſet any bounds to your promiſe to a Miſtris?
Why, you ſhould run full ſpeed unto all you thought
ſhe would have, or could poſſibly deſire, to make her
think you were one mad, and dying for her; and when
y' have won her, and are married, then you may do as
moſt married men does, pace them in the performance, or
quite bed-rid them; or if you will keep in the rank of
the beſt Husbands, why then you muſt make your Wife
Parſon of your Courting, Vows, and Promiſes, and give
her the Tyths; for when they have run out of their wits
ſo far, that it cannot keep'em from going to Service, 'tis
fit they know they have a Maſter.</p>

                     <l>But Heav'n the greateſt faults that are forgive,</l>
                     <l>'Tis noble, when we may kill, to let live.</l>

                     <l>Had you bin ſtill, Sir, to that Maxim true,</l>
                     <l>I had not then bin ſcorn'd, nor left by you:</l>
                     <l>When you the life did take of all my joy,</l>
                     <l>You ſhow'd not the left pity to deſtroy.</l>
                     <l>But you would have, I find, a Womans breaſt</l>
                     <l>With more Compaſſion and more Love poſſeſt.</l>

            <l>NOw I am ſure, all look that I ſhould ſay</l>
            <l>Something like asking pardon for the Play:</l>
            <l>With low ſubmiſſion, and I can't tell what:</l>
            <l>Excuſe her Writing, Language, and her Plot!</l>
            <l>As crafty Poets Guilty cry their Wit,</l>
            <l>To make you leſs ſevere in laſhing it.</l>
            <l>But, faith, ſhe ſcorns ſuch undermining ways,</l>
            <l>Of blowing up your pity into praiſe;</l>
            <l>Nor will ſhe do her ſpirit ſo much wrong,</l>
            <l>To beg what does not to her brow belong.</l>
            <l>She ſays, they're fools force <hi>Fate,</hi> before they be</l>
            <l>Reſolv'd to meet with any Destiny.</l>
            <l>But, this revenge ſhe's ſure to have on thoſe,</l>
            <l>They'l Cowards be esteem'd that give her blows.</l>
            <l>Which ſtrangely takes her! knowing that ye must</l>
            <l>Be to your Honor, or your Wit unjuſt.</l>
            <l>Mark how maliciouſly her ſnares ſh'as laid:</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Praiſe</hi> or <hi>Condemn,</hi> you're equally betray'd.</l>
