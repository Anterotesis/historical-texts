            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>'TIS from Your innate Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness only, and that conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending Temper which is so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in You, that this Foreign Leaf dares presume to court Your Favour, and hope for a welcom Entertainment. For where can a Stranger, that was always bred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a People the most polite of any in the World, expect a kind Reception with more Assurance, than from a Person, whose Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation is adorn'd with all that Civility that even <hi>China</hi> it self can boast of? And therefore while it
<pb facs="tcp:98217:3"/>
gains Your Countenance, 'twill find it self as happy here, as if it still had stay'd at home; nay, rather with Advantage to have chang'd its delightful native Soil, while 'tis under the more pleasant Influences of Your Protection.</p>
            <p>But though the Name of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>Madam,</hi> so Eminent as You are, both upon the Account of Your Illustrious <hi>ORMOND</hi> Family, and those particular Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which give You so distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Character, were enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend this healthful Herb to any that were in the least acquainted with either of them; yet is it not it self destitute of some peculiar Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which may justly claim a very favourable Encouragement from us.</p>
            <p>For it is generally acknowledg'd
<pb facs="tcp:98217:3"/>
to be both Pleasant and Medicinal, at once to delight the Palate and correct the Disease, and to heal the Distemper without giving any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance to the Stomach.</p>
            <p>And certainly were the Custom of Drinking it as Universal here, as it is in the Eastern Countries, we should quickly find that Men might be chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful with Sobriety, and witty without the Danger of losing their Senses; and that they might even double the Days of their natural Life, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting it all into Enjoyment, exempt from several painful and acute Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, occasion'd very often by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Excess of inflaming Liquors, which render it rather a Burthen, than a Blessing to us.</p>
            <p>But in pity, <hi>Madam,</hi> to this tender Leaf, I must cease from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrick,
<pb facs="tcp:98217:4"/>
lest it should create a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, and the innocent Praises of it be eccho'd back in sharp Invectives. For since its Constitution is so nice and delicate, as to be injur'd even by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Air, it will never be able to withstand the Malignity of an envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Breath, unless Your Honour and Goodness interpose, which are so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous, that Malice it self would blush to fix an Imputation upon them.</p>
            <p>And from these Excellencies of Yours, which are the Crown and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of Nobility, the Author hopes to find Your Pardon in the present Dedication; and that the Greatness of Your Mind will at this time show it self in Your Indulgence to,</p>

               <pb n="1" facs="tcp:98217:4"/>AN ESSAY UPON THE <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Qualities</hi> OF TEA.</p>
            <p>THough the Use of <hi>Tea</hi> has for many Years past been highly approv'd of in the Empires of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi> which are at present the chief Kingdoms that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98217:5"/>
cherish this <hi>celebrated Leaf</hi>; yet since the <hi>Europeans</hi> by their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Navigations have open'd a freer Trade and Commerce to those Parts, and have thereby been better acquainted with the Genius of those People, and their Manner of Life, they have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by taken occasion to inform us, among other things, with the singular Esteem which those <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Nations</hi> harbour for it, and of what daily Use it is among them. Whereupon this <hi>Western World</hi> has been induc'd of late to encourage the Importation of it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Reasons of the Importation.</hi>
               </note> and make some Experiments of its admirable Effects, either out of <hi>Curiosity,</hi> because of its <hi>Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; or out of <hi>Pleasure</hi> of gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Palate</hi>; or because of some <hi>Medicinal Vertues,</hi> with which it is pregnant. And since the Drinking of it has of late ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd here so universally, as to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98217:5"/>
be affected both by the <hi>Scholar</hi> and the <hi>Tradesman,</hi> to become both a private <hi>Regale</hi> at <hi>Court,</hi> and to be made use of in places of <hi>publick Entertainment,</hi> which has greatly rais'd the Character, and gain'd it a singular Repute; it might not be amiss therefore to draw up a short Account of its <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Qualities,</hi> to satisfy such as are its curious Admirers with the Knowledge of its Use. I will here discourse therefore of the <hi>Climate</hi> and <hi>Soil</hi> this Herb grows in, and its <hi>various Kinds</hi>; of the <hi>Method of chusing</hi> what is best, and the <hi>means of preserving it</hi>; and the several <hi>Virtues</hi> for which it is fam'd: With an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to one Objection or two which are sometimes urg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.</p>
            <p>That which in <hi>England</hi> is called <hi>Tea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Name of it.</hi>
               </note> is in some other places pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98217:6"/>
               <hi>Thee,</hi> especially in the Province of <hi>Fokien,</hi> which lies in <hi>China</hi> between 25 and 30 <hi>deg.</hi> of Latitude. But there, they say, the word is corrupted; for such as pretend to the genuine and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Pronunciation of it, will have it term'd, according to the <hi>Mandarin</hi> Language,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> Mandarins <hi>are the great Men in</hi> China.</note> 
               <hi>Tcha,</hi> and some <hi>Tsia.</hi> But how different so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Name of it may be, the thing it self is universally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Tea</hi> is a Leaf which grows upon a <hi>Shrub</hi> in <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Japan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Tree of</hi> Tea <hi>describ'd.</hi>
               </note> not exceeding either in Height or Breadth our <hi>Rose</hi> or <hi>Goosberry-Bushes</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> The Branches of which, from the Root to the Top, are cloath'd with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of tender Leaves of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Magnitude, though of the same Form and Shape. For <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,</hi> who liv'd several years
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98217:6"/>
in the Empire of <hi>Japan,</hi> assures us, That <hi>upon the same Tree are Leaves of five different Proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the largest of which resemble our Garden Balm, and grow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Root; and as they rise in Height, their Size decreases; but the smallest bear the largest Price. The Seed of it is round and black, which in three years time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is sown, produces new Plants. But the Flowers of it, which are all white, are of no Esteem; the main Virtue is lodged in the Leaves.</hi> When the <hi>Flowers</hi> however are new and fresh, they yield a very pleasant Smell; but in time, as I have seen them, they grow yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and being put into Water, turn it brown. They consist of five whitish or palish Leaves, with many Chives in the middle of the Flower.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:98217:7"/>The Shrub it self is of a strong and hardy Constitution, is proof against Storms, and receives no Damage by Snow or Hail, and lives and thrives in those very Climates, the sharpness of whose Air might seem pernicious, if not fatal to its tender Leaf; for the Winter in <hi>England,</hi> in some places where it grows, is not more cold. The <hi>stony Soils</hi> are apt in <hi>China</hi> to produce the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest <hi>Tea,</hi> though for the most part it is planted there in the Valleys, and in light ground. And might it therefore be convenient to have it brought hither, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Nature either of our Ground or Air that seem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict its Increase among us; Especially if sufficient Care were taken for the safe and cautious Transportation of the Seed or Branches, and in their Growth they were expos'd, with the best
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98217:7"/>
Advantage, to the Sun. Though the Art here used for raising of it has not yet answer'd Expectation. But whether this proceeds from the <hi>Envy</hi> of the <hi>Chinese,</hi> who are said to boil the Seed, lest it should be planted any-where else; or from the Age of it, or untimely Collection of it, or the immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Heat of the Sun, and variety of Weathers in a long Voyage, it's uncertain.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spring</hi> is reputed the most proper Season for gathering the Leaves,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Season for gathering it.</hi>
               </note> because 'tis this time on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the year that renders them most soft and delicate, juicy and tender; which gives the Water wherein they are infus'd both a more pleasant Flavor to gratify the <hi>Smell,</hi> and a Taste more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Palate.</hi> And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 'tis none of the meanest Signs
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98217:8"/>
of the remarkable Ingenuity of the <hi>Chinese,</hi> to prepare the <hi>Leaves</hi> with so much Art to make them still continue <hi>green,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Length of Time they have been dried. Which, I think, is not very usual with our dried Herbs in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>China</hi> are several sorts of <hi>Tea,</hi>

                  <hi>The several sorts of it.</hi>
               </note> which are unknown to us in <hi>Europe,</hi> some of which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cheap; but others are so high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valuable and much esteem'd, that a single <hi>Catte</hi> is look'd upon as a Present fit for a <hi>Mandarin.</hi>

there, is both planted in the most refin'd Earth, and carefully defended from all Injuries of the Air, from all excessive Colds and Heats, and every thing that may be apt to offend the tender Leaf. And as at home they commonly affect the Entertainment of a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Multitude of Servants, and a stately Furniture of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the Preparation of their <hi>Tea</hi> in the greatest Magnificence and Splendor; so they want not abroad such as are purposely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to husband it with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Care and Diligence, as well as with a peculiar Art. But that which is generally brought into <hi>Europe,</hi> is known only by these three distinct Names.</p>
            <p>The first Sort is <hi>Bohe,</hi> or,<note place="margin">

brown, or of a reddish Colour. Those in <hi>China</hi> that are <hi>sick,</hi> or are very careful of preserving their Health, if they are weak, confine themselves only to this kind of <hi>Tea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>This kind of</hi> Tea <hi>is of a healing Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
               </note> to which they are willing to ascribe a peculiar Virtue both for <hi>healing</hi> and <hi>preventing</hi> a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, and extol it as a mighty Friend to Nature when it is grown faint and languishing. The Taste of it, when it is very true and genuine, is delicious and pleasant, and the weakest Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is able to bear it. This kind of <hi>Tea</hi> therefore is both in Colour and in Nature different from the other two, and very useful to such as are <hi>wasting</hi> and <hi>consumptive,</hi> and excels the others in its healing balsamick Quality, and particularly in improving by <hi>Length of Time,</hi> which is very pernicious to the rest, for it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally grows better the longer it is kept.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:98217:9"/>The second Sort is <hi>Singlo,</hi>

One of them is a <hi>narrow and long Leaf.</hi> The other <hi>smaller,</hi> and of a <hi>blewish green Colour,</hi> which tastes very crisp when it is chaw'd, and afterwards looks green upon the Hand, and infuses a pale Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness into the Water. The Flavor of it is fresh and fine, lively and pleasant. 'Tis strong, and will endure the Change of Water three or four times.

For the <hi>fragrant Smell,</hi> the <hi>green Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,</hi> and the <hi>bitterish sweet Taste,</hi> are the distinguishing Characters of the Goodness of this kind of <hi>Tea.</hi>

The finest Sort of it looks both green to the Eye, and is crisp in the Mouth, and the Smell of it is very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, which inhances the Price of it here in <hi>England</hi>; and 'tis highly esteem'd likewise in <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> being sold there at three times the Price of the other two. But it generally is of divers Colours, as yellow, green, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted weak, spending it self quickly in the Infusion, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tinctures the Water with any Spirit twice, because it is not put in weight for weight with other <hi>Tea.</hi> This likewise, as the others,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98217:11"/>
is Imported in large thick Tota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neg <hi>Canisters</hi> included in wooden Tubs, or in Baskets made of small <hi>Bamboe</hi> Canes.</p>
            <p>These are those several sorts of <hi>Tea,</hi> to some one of which all that is transported hither is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly reduc'd; and in describing this Variety, and the different Properties of each of them, some <hi>Directions</hi> have been given for distinguishing what is choice and good, from what is mean and refuse; which Instruction I shall pursue, with one Remark more, a little further.</p>
            <p>'Tis necessary for all such as travel to <hi>China,</hi> nicely to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Nature of the Goods there, if they intend to escape the Cheats and Frauds, and to trade therein with Advantage. For such is the Subtilty of the <hi>Chinese</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:98217:11"/>
in their <hi>Trade,</hi> and so artificial are they in their <hi>Traffick,</hi> and so mightily intent upon their <hi>Gain,</hi> that they falsify every thing they sell, if 'tis capable of <hi>Sophistica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; and he must be very quick and expert indeed, that has wit enough to escape in all things their Impositions. This they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly practic'd even in their Sale of <hi>Tea,</hi> though the Advantage of it was inconsiderable. For with it they sometimes mixt some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Herbs of less value, to swell the Parcel, and increase the Gain, and with this artificial Mixture they cunningly dispos'd of it. But the Prudence and Caution of the <hi>Europeans</hi> prevent at present all the fraudulent Attempts of this Nature. And yet such is the peculiar Talent of the <hi>Chinese</hi> in the Management of this Art, that the Discovery of them in one Trick, is only the quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98217:12"/>
their Invention of another; and he that has thought himself wise in timely preventing of a small Cheat, has found after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards how weak he was, when by this means he only tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to over-wit him in a greater. And though 'tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to fix their Honesty for some time in that particular wherein the fraud has been found out, yet will their inherent Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity soon exert it self in some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, and make them kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish by Transmutation. Which occasions the wary <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Merchants in their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for <hi>Tea</hi> to open many times both the <hi>Top,</hi> the <hi>Middle,</hi> and the <hi>Bottom</hi> of the <hi>Canisters,</hi> to prevent the Cheat of courser <hi>Tea</hi> which has been sometimes privately put into one place, sometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another.</p>

               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:98217:12"/>The Method the <hi>Chinese</hi> use in preparing of <hi>Tea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Method of preparing</hi> Tea.</note> to make it dry and crisp, is, as some affirm, to put it in Ovens, or in Kilns, or to expose it to the Sun; or as others say, by frying it twice or oftner in a Pan; and as often as it is taken off the Fire, it is roll'd with the Hand upon a Table till it curls. By this means the Leaves contract such a <hi>Dryness</hi> and <hi>Hardness,</hi> as inables them to retain their Virtue for many years.</p>
            <p>Though the Tree of <hi>Tea</hi> is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by Nature against rigid Colds, against Storms and bad Weather, and is able to subsist and flourish even upon stony Ground; yet the <hi>Leaf</hi> of it, when once it is prepar'd for Use, is of a Temper quite different; 'tis <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate</hi> and <hi>tender,</hi> injur'd by the <hi>Breath,</hi> and damag'd by the very

Having thus far discours'd of the <hi>various Kinds</hi> of this foreign Leaf, and the <hi>Season</hi> wherein it should be gather'd, of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of making choice of the best,</hi> and the <hi>Means</hi> whereby it is <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd</hi>; the Reader now will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to hear something of its <hi>Qualifications,</hi>

And if we may believe those persons who have been most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant with this healthful Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and receiv'd it so long in the Nature of their common Drink, we must needs entertain some Esteem for its Excellence, and harbour a valuable Opinion of it.<note place="margin">

The Privilege of which they reckon upon as a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Blessing to those Nations, especially when attended with such remarkable Effects. And if the intolerable Pains of these Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers are caus'd by an <hi>acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious Juice,</hi> and some <hi>ferment</hi> that is <hi>saline,</hi> this Liquor is said to mitigate the <hi>Salt,</hi> disturb the <hi>Tartar,</hi> and dissolve its <hi>gravelly Particles,</hi> when 'tis much and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten drunk.

yet may they in some measure, by a daily Use of this excellent Drink, be much <hi>dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd,</hi> or at least be kept from an <hi>Increase</hi>; Especially if it be drunk in such a <hi>Quantity,</hi> and at such convenient <hi>Times,</hi> when the Stomach is rather empty than over-charg'd.

            <p>Nor are the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who are now Masters of this large and

is most powerful upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is very harsh, course and unpleasant, and only grows in the Northern Province of <hi>Xensi,</hi> most of which lies between 35 and 40 deg. of Latitude.

            <p>The last Remark which I shall make of this innocent lovely Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, is the Advantage which it has over <hi>Wine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>It prevails over the Fumes of Wine.</hi>
               </note> and the Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant which it gains over the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Juice of the Grape, which so frequently betrays Men into so much Mischief, and so many Follies. For this admirable <hi>Tea</hi> endeavours to reconcile Men to <hi>Sobriety,</hi> when their Brains are overcast with the Fumes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, and disorder'd with Excess of Drinking; by driving away the superfluous Humors that cloud the Rational Faculty, and disturb the Powers of the Mind. And therefore all those persons who have by this means lost their Senses, and have pass'd the Bounds of Moderation, ought presently
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98217:17"/>
to water their Veins with this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and refresh themselves with its sober Draughts, if they are willing to recollect their roving Thoughts, and be Masters of their Faculties again. For this is none of its meanest Triumphs, that 'tis able to subdue this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering Liquor, that has foil'd so many wise and powerful; that it is an <hi>Anti Circe,</hi> can counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charm the inchanted Cup, and change the Beast into a Man. <hi>Vertiginem capitisque dolorem (prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertim à crapula ortum) mitigat</hi>

often a kind Relief to this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, by obstructing the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the Steam from the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and lower Parts. Because the thick Vapors that continually ascend, being the Cause of this Disturbance, whenever they are check'd and controll'd in their Passage by the lively Spirit of <hi>Tea,</hi> the <hi>Megrim</hi> sensibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.

               <l>The Muses friend, <hi>TEA,</hi> does our Fancy aid;</l>
               <l>Repress those Vapors which the Head invade:</l>

               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:98217:19"/>And from this eminent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty which it has of animating the Faculties,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>And keeps Men waking.</hi>
               </note> and keeping up the Vigor of the Spirits, arises that other remarkable Power which it gains over <hi>Sleep</hi> and <hi>Drowziness,</hi> and the natural Inclination of the Body to Rest. So that a few Cups of this excellent Liquor will soon rowze the cloudy Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors that be night the Brain, and drive away all Mists from the Eyes. 'Tis a kind of another <hi>Phoebus</hi> to the Soul, both for <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiring</hi> and <hi>inlightning</hi> it; and in spight of all the Darkness of the Night, and all the Heaviness of the Mind, 'twill brighten and animate the Thoughts, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel those Mists of Humors that dull and darken Meditation. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bording to Dr. <hi>Chamberlayn</hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in his Treatise of <hi>Tea; When I have been,</hi> says he, <hi>compell'd
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98217:20"/>
to sit up all Night about some extraordinary Business, I needed to do no more than to take some of this Tea, when I perceiv'd my self beginning to sleep, and I could easily watch all Night without winking; and in the Morning I was as fresh as if I had slept my ordinary time; this I could do once a week without any trouble.</hi> And this certainly must gain it a mighty Veneration from all those Sons of the <hi>Muses,</hi> who labour in the Night, and are desirous to keep their <hi>Memories</hi> fresh, and their <hi>Senses</hi> waking; and endeavour to prolong those Hours that are devoted to studious Thoughts, in Strength and Clearness of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing; Because at such times in the Use of this sprightly Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, they perceive a speedy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against their natural Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness and Stupidity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:98217:20"/>And that the several Virtues which are here ascrib'd to this delicate Leaf are not meerly No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, or of bare Conjecture, the Testimonies of several eminent Authors might be produc'd, such as <hi>Ray</hi>'s Histor. Plant. <hi>Olaus Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius</hi> in Musaeo, p. 165. <hi>Tulpius</hi> Observat. 1. 4. cap. ult. &amp;c. But the account of one of them only shall be at present sufficient. The Learned <hi>Michael Etmuller,</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor of Physick at <hi>Lipsick,</hi> in the third Edition of his Notes on <hi>Schroder</hi>'s Pharmacy, publish'd by his Scholar Dr. <hi>John Caspar</hi> of <hi>Westphalia,</hi> gives an account of the Herb <hi>Tcha,</hi> or <hi>Tea,</hi> to this purpose; <hi>It powerfully corrects In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digestions and Crudities, so as that the very</hi> Chinese <hi>use this Drink to strengthen the first Digestion, and to purify the Mass of Blood by a Flux of Vrine. Whence it is that they rarely labour under the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98217:21"/>
Hypocondriack Passion, descended from a deprav'd Stomach: for</hi> Tcha'<hi>s Aromatick Virtue takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all acid Crudities. Besides, it is a very famous Cephalick, adds a wonderful Strength to the Animal Spirits, and by that means opposes the Megrim, and admirably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts the Memory, and other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul. Moreover, it drives away Drowziness, and keeps a man awake without Weariness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is a most noble Antinephritick and Antipodagrick; whereupon they that take this Drink, are not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Stone and Gravel, while it partly throws it out, and partly destroys the preternatural Acid in the Stomach and Guts, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the Blood, (volatilizing it, if coagulated by an Acid) in which Respect it preserves both from the Stone and Gout, whereby the</hi> Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese <hi>and</hi> Japanese <hi>are rarely, if
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98217:21"/>
ever, infested with them.</hi> All which admirable Effects, and much more, are confirm'd by the most famous <hi>Wilhelmus ten Rhyne,</hi> Physician, Botanist, and Chymist to the Emperor of <hi>Japan,</hi> in his Discourse <hi>De Frutice Thee</hi>; Who there affirms too, that <hi>it both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails against the Dropsy, and is an Antidote extraordinary against the Weakness of the Sight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all this Authority, this Leaf has former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been subject to Reproach and Cavil. And it were a happy Leaf indeed were it altogether Objection free, and out of the Reach of Enmity and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. But however, this Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness it has, That herein it shares Fate with all things that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, which are often aspers'd even for their <hi>Innocence,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Two Objections answer'd.</hi>
               </note> and in that respect owe all their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98217:22"/>
to their Perfection. That which was wont to be argued in Disparagement of that general Credit which this Drink by its Merits has obtain'd, was, That it was a Parent to the <hi>Cholick</hi> and <hi>Diabetes,</hi> though it was very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful upon other accounts; and that it unhappily caus'd these Diseases among us. But notwithstanding that 'tis very well known, that these are no upstart Distempers here, but challenge a Standing of ancient Date; yet were they the necessary Consequence of the Use of this modern Liquor in <hi>England,</hi> all the <hi>Eastern Nations,</hi> especially <hi>China, India,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi> must needs be sorely afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them; and therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of encouraging as they do, must rather renounce their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Drink, unless they are more inamour'd with it, than with their Health. And yet we
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98217:22"/>
never hear that these Diseases are complain'd of there, though this Liquor is as familiarly us'd by them, as Small Beer is with us; and that not only by the <hi>Natives,</hi> but by several <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who are nevertheless alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether Strangers to the Painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of those Maladies. If the <hi>Diabetes</hi> derives it self from this Fountain, how comes it to pass then, that among all the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Admirers of <hi>Tea,</hi> so very few labour under that Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? And as to the <hi>Cholick,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny skilful Practitioners in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick do observe, that several Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of inferior Note in <hi>England,</hi> whose Fortunes never rais'd them to the Character of being <hi>Tea-drinkers,</hi> are more disturb'd with that Distemper, than such as plentifully drink it daily.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:98217:23"/>Yet some will urge, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though these Virtues which I have mention'd may be fairly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to this <hi>China</hi> Liquor, yet are they sometimes obstructed by the Use of that Sugar which is commonly mix'd with it. And this indeed, I must confess, may somewhat abate the Efficacy of it in some Operations; yet this Advantage it produces, in bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting of the <hi>Lungs</hi> and <hi>Reins</hi>; to which it is a mighty Friend.</p>
            <p>And yet after all, though these rare and excellent Qualities have long been observable in <hi>Tea,</hi> yet must we not imagine that they always meet with the same Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect indifferently in all Persons, or that they universally prevail. For either the <hi>Height</hi> of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, or the long <hi>Continuance</hi> of it; either the <hi>Constitution</hi> of the Person, or some certain <hi>occult
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98217:23"/>
Indisposition</hi> may avert the Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, and obstruct or delay the desir'd Success. It may either be drunk without <hi>Advice,</hi> or at <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable Times</hi>; either the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or the <hi>Tea,</hi> may be bad; and if the <hi>Physick</hi> it self be sickly, we cannot easily expect much <hi>Health</hi> by it.</p>
