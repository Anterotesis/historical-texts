            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

If I can but get his cloke, his purse, his hat, nay, anything, to cut him off, that is, to stay his iourney, <hi>Veni, vidi, vici</hi>, I may say with Captayne CAESAR, I am made for euer, ifaith.

                     <sp>
                        <l>I Cannot loose the thought, yet, of this letter,</l>
                        <l>Sent to my sonne: nor leaue t'admire the change</l>
                        <l>Of manners, and the breeding of our youth,</l>
                        <l>Within the kingdome, since my selfe was one.</l>
                        <l>When I was yong, he liu'd not in the stewes,</l>
                        <l>Durst haue conceiu'd a scorne, and vtter'd it,</l>
                        <l>On a grey head; age was authoritie</l>
                        <l>Against a buffon: and a man had, then,</l>
                        <l>A certaine reuerence pai'd vnto his yeeres,</l>
                        <l>That had none due vnto his life. So much</l>
                        <l>The sanctitie of some preuail'd, for others.</l>
                        <l>But, now, we all are fall'n; youth, from their feare:</l>
                        <l>And age, from that, which bred it, good example.</l>
                        <l>Nay, would our selues were not the first, euen parents,</l>
                        <l>That did destroy the hopes, in our owne children:</l>
                        <l>Or they not learn'd our vices, in their cradles,</l>
                        <l>And suck'd in our ill customes, with their milke.</l>
                        <l>Ere all their teeth be borne, or they can speake,</l>
                        <l>We make their palats cunning! The first wordes,</l>
                        <l>We forme their tongues with, are licentious iests!</l>
                        <l>Can it call, whore? crie, bastard? Ô, then, kisse it,</l>
                        <l>A wittie child! Can't sweare? The fathers dearling!</l>
                        <l>Giue it two plums. Nay, rather then 't shall learne</l>
                        <l>No bawdie song, the mother' her selfe will teach it!</l>
                        <l>But, this is in the infancie; the dayes</l>
                        <l>Of the long coate: when it puts on the breeches,</l>
                        <l>It will put off all this. I, it is like:</l>
                        <l>When it is gone into the bone alreadie.</l>
                        <l>No, no: This die goes deeper then the coate,</l>
                        <l>Or shirt, or skin. It staines, vnto the liuer,</l>
                        <l>And heart, in some. And, rather, then it should not,</l>
                        <l>Note, what we fathers doe! Looke, how we liue!</l>
                        <l>What mistresses we keepe! at what expense,</l>
                        <l>In our sonnes eyes! where they may handle our gifts,</l>

                        <l>Heare our lasciuious courtships, see our dalliance,</l>
                        <l>Tast of the same prouoking meates, with vs,</l>
                        <l>To ruine of our states! Nay, when our owne</l>
                        <l>Portion is fled, to prey on their remainder,</l>
                        <l>We call them into fellowship of vice!</l>
                        <l>Baite 'hem with the yong chamber-maid, to seale!</l>
                        <l>And teach 'hem all bad wayes, to buy affiction!</l>
                        <l>This is one path! but there are millions more,</l>
                        <l>In which we spoile our owne, with leading them.</l>
                        <l>Well, I thanke heauen, I neuer yet was he,</l>
                        <l>That trauail'd with my sonne, before sixteene,</l>

                        </l>

                        <l>To my sharpe boy, at twelue: repeating still</l>

                        <l>No matter, by what meanes; Money will doe</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>More, Boy, then my Lords letter.</hi> Neither haue I</l>

                        <l>Perfum'd my sauces, and taught him to make 'hem;</l>

                        <l>His palate should degenerate, not his manners.</l>
                        <l>These are the trade of fathers, now! how euer</l>
                        <l>My sonne, I hope, hath met within my threshold,</l>
                        <l>None of these houshold precedents; which are strong,</l>
                        <l>And swift, to rape youth, to their precipice.</l>

                        <l>Swept, or kept sweet from filth; nay, dust, and cob-webs:</l>

This small piece of seruice, will bring him cleane out of loue with the souldier, for euer. He will neuer come within the signe of it, the sight of a cassock, or a musket-rest againe. Hee will hate the musters at Mile-end for it, to his dying day. It's no matter, let the world thinke me a bad coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, If I cannot giue him the slip, at an instant: why, this is better then to haue staid his iourney! well, Ile follow him: oh, how I long to bee imployed.</p>

I haue been in the <hi>Indies</hi> (where this herb growes) where neither my selfe, nor a dozen gentlemen more (of my knowledge) haue receiued the tast of any other nutriment, in the world, for the space of one and twentie weekes, but the fume of this simple onely. Therefore, it cannot be, but 'tis most diuine! Further, take it in the nature, in the true kind so, it makes an <hi>antidote</hi>, that (had you taken the most deadly poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous plant in all <hi>Italy</hi>, it should expell it, and clarifie you, with as much ease, as I speake. And, for your greene wound, your <hi>Balsamum</hi>, and your S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. IOHN'S <hi>woort</hi> are all mere gulleries, and trash to it, especially your <hi>Trinidado</hi>: your <hi>Nicotian</hi> is good too. I could say what I know of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of it, for the expulsion of rhewmes, raw humours, crudities, obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, with a thousand of this kind, but I professe my selfe no <hi>quack-saluer.</hi> Only, thus much, by HERCVLES, I doe hold it, and will affirme it (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Prince in <hi>Europe</hi>) to be the most soueraigne, and precious weede, that euer the earth tendred to the vse of man.</p>

If he were an vnthrift, a ruffian, a drunkard, or a licentious liuer, then you had reason; you had reason to take care: but, being none of these, mirth's my witnesse, an' I had twise so many cares, as you haue, I'ld drowne them all in a cup of sacke. Come, come, let's trie it: I muse, your parcell of a souldier returnes not all this while.</p>

                        <p>I will tell you, sir. Vpon my first comming to the citie, after
my long trauaile, for knowledge (in that mysterie only) there came three,
of foure of 'hem to me, at a gentlemans house, where it was my chance to
be resident, at that time, to intreat my presence at their scholes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
so much importun'd me, that (I protest to you as I am a gentleman) I
was asham'd of their rude demeanor, out of all measure: well, I told 'hem,
that to come to a publike schoole, they should pardon me, it was opposite
(in <hi>diameter</hi>) to my humour, but, if so they would giue their attendance
at my lodging, I protested to doe them what right or fauour I could, as I
was a gentleman, and so forth.</p>

haue purchas'd 'hem, since, a credit, to admiration! they canot denie this:

                        <p>Nay, for a more instance of their preposterous natures, but note, sir.

Yet, all this lenitie will not ore-come their spleene: they will be doing with the pismier, raysing a hill, a man may spurne abroad, with his foot, at pleasure. By my selfe, I could haue slaine them all, but I delight not in murder.

                        <p>Why thus, sir. I would select nineteene, more, to my selfe, throughout the land; gentlemen they should bee of good spirit, strong, and able constitution, i would choose them by an instinct, a character, that I haue: and I would teach these nineteene, the speciall rules, as your <hi>Punto</hi>, your <hi>Reuerso</hi>, your <hi>Stoccata</hi>, your <hi>Imbroccata</hi>, your <hi>Passada</hi>, your <hi>Montanto</hi>: till they could all play very neare, or altogether as well as my selfe. This done, say the enemie were fortie thousand strong, we twentie would come into the field, the tenth of <hi>March</hi>, or thereabouts; and wee would chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge twentie of the enemie; they could not, in their honour, refuse vs, well, wee would kill them: challenge twentie more, kill them; twentie more, kill them; twentie more, kill them too; and thus, would wee kill, euery man, his twentie a day, that's twentie score; twentie score, that's two hundreth; two hundreth a day, fiue dayes a thousand; fortie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand; fortie times fiue, fiue times fortie, two hundreth dayes kills them all vp, by computation. And this, will I venture my poore gentleman-like carcasse, to performe (prouided, there bee no treason practis'd vpon vs) by faire, and discreet manhood, that is, ciuilly by the sword.</p>

We must get our fortunes committed to some larger prison, say; and, then the tower, I know no better aire: nor where the libertie of the house may doe vs more present seruice. Away.</p>

                        <l>Why Humour (as 'tis <hi>ens</hi>) we thus define it</l>
                        <l>To be a quality of aire or water,</l>
                        <l>And in it selfe holds these two properties,</l>
                        <l>Moisture and fluxure: As, for demonstration,</l>
                        <l>Powre water on this floore, 'twill wet and runne:</l>
                        <l>Likewise the aire (forc't through a horne or trumpet)</l>
                        <l>Flowes instantly away, and leaues behind</l>
                        <l>A kind of dew; and hence we doe conclude,</l>
                        <l>That what soe're hath fluxure, and humiditie,</l>
                        <l>As wanting power to containe it selfe,</l>
                        <l>Is Humour: so in euery humane body</l>

more then they: euery man in the dignitie of his spirit and

chang'd since, in MENANDER, PHILEMON, CECILIVS, PLAVTVS,

Yes, sir, hee shewed himselfe a true CLOG in the coherence of that affaire, sir; for if he had manag'd matters
as they were corroborated to him, it had beene better for him by a fortie, or fiftie score of pounds, sir, and he himselfe might
ha' liu'd (in despight

                        <p>Faith, sir, the same that sundred AGAMEMNON, and great THETIS sonne; but let the cause escape, sir: Hee sent mee a challenge (mict with some few braues) which I restor'd, and in fine we met. Now indeed, sir, (I must tell you) he did offer at first very desperately, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iudgement: for looke you, sir. I cast my selfe into this figure: now he, comes violently on, and withall aduancing his rapier to strike, I thought to haue tooke his arme (for he had left his whole body to my election, and I was sure he could not recouer his guard) Sir, I mist my purpose in his arme, rasht his doublet sleeue, ran him close by the left cheek, and through his haire. He againe, lights me here (I had on, a gold cable hatband, then new come vp, which I wore about a murrey <hi>French</hi> hat I had) cuts my hatband (and yet it was massie, gold-smithes worke) cuts my brimmes, which by good fortune (being thicke embrodered with gold-twist, and spangles) disappointed the force of the blow: Neuerthelesse, it graz'd on my shoulder, takes me away sixe purles of an <hi>Italian</hi> cut-worke band I wore (cost me three pound in the exchange, but three daies before.)</p>

Now (vpon the second signe of his assault) I betooke me to the former manner of my defence; he (on the other side) abandon'd his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the same danger, as before, and followes me still with blowes: But I (being loth to take the deadly aduantage that lay before mee of his left side) made a kind of <hi>stramazoun</hi>, ranne him vp to the hilts, through the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:12766:86"/>
doublet, through the shirt, and yet mist the skin. Hee (making a reuerse blow) falls vpon my emboss'd girdle (I had throwne off the hangers a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before) strikes off a skirt of a thick—lac't sattin doublet I had (lin'd with some foure taffataes) cuts off two panes, embrodered with pearle, rends through the drawings out of tissew, enters the linings, and skips the flesh.</p>

                        <p>True, my raw-bon'd-rogue, and if thou would'st farce thy
leane ribs with it too, they would not (like ragged lathes) rub out so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
doublets as they doe: but thou know'st not a good dish, thou. O, it's
the only nourishing meat in the world. No maruaile though that saucie,
stubborne generation, the <hi>Iewes,</hi> were forbidden it: for what would they
ha' done, well pamper'd with fat porke, that durst murmure at their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
out of garlicke, and onions. S'light, fed with it, the whorson strum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell,

Well said, my sweet GEORGE, fill, fill.</p>

                        <p>O lord, Master FASTIDIVS, if you knew how I tooke vp my husband to day, when hee said hee would arrest you; and how I rail'd at him that perswaded him to't, the scholer there, (who on my conscience loues you now) and what care I tooke to send you intelligence by my brother; and how I gaue him foure soueraignes for his paines; and now,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:12766:98"/>
how I came running out hither without man or boy with me, so soone as I heard on't; you'ld say, I were in a passion indeed: your keeper, for gods sake. O, Master BRISKE (as 'tis in EVPHVES) <hi>Hard is the choise, when one is compelled either by silence to die with griefe, or by speaking to liue with shame.</hi>

                        <p>First, the title of his play is CYNTHIAS <hi>Reuels</hi>, as any man (that hath hope to bee saued by his booke) can witnesse; the <hi>Scene</hi>, GARGA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHIE: which I doe vehemently suspect for some sustian countrie, but let that vanish. Here, is the court of CYNTHIA, whither hee brings CV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PID (trauailing on foot) resolu'd to turne page. By the way, CVPID meetes with MERCVRIE, (as that's a thing to be noted, take anie of our play-bookes without a CVPID, or a MERCVRY in it, and burne it for an heretique in <hi>Poetrie</hi>)— Pray thee let me alone. MERCVRY, he (in the nature of a conjurer) raises vp ECCHO, who weepes ouer her loue, or Daffodill, NARCISSVS, a little; sings; curses the spring where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the prettie foolish gentleman melted himselfe away: and ther's an end of her.—Now I am to informe you, that CVPID, and MERCVRY doe both become pages. CVPID attends on PHILAVTIA, or <hi>selfe-Loue</hi>, a court-ladie MERCVRY followes HEDON, the <hi>voluptuous</hi>, and a courtier; one that rankes himselfe euen with ANAIDES, or the <hi>impudent</hi>, a gallant, (and that's my part:) one that keepes <hi>laughter</hi>, GELAIA the daughter of <hi>folly</hi>, (a wench in boyes attire) to waite on him—These, in the court, meet with AMORPHVS, or the <hi>deformed</hi>; a trauailer that hath drunke of the fountaine, and there tels the wonders of the water. They presently dispatch away their pages with bottles to fetch of it, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues goe to visite the ladies. But I should haue told you— (Looke, these emets put me out here) that with this AMORPHVS, there comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long a citizens heire, ASOTVS, or the <hi>prodigall</hi>, who (in imitation of the traueller, who hath the <hi>whetstone</hi> following him) entertaines the <hi>begger</hi>, to be his attendant.—Now, the <hi>Nymphs</hi> who are mistresses to these gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, are PHILAVTIA, <hi>selfe-Loue</hi>; PHANTASTE, <hi>a light wittinesse</hi>; ARGV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RION <hi>monie</hi>; and their <hi>Guardian</hi>, mother MORIA; or mistresse <hi>folly.</hi>—</p>

                        <p>There CVPID strikes <hi>monie</hi> in loue with the <hi>prodigall</hi>, makes her dote vpon him, giue him iewels, bracelets, carkenets, &amp;c. all which (hee most ingeniously departs withall) to be made knowne to the other ladies and gallants; and in the heat of this, increases his traine with the <hi>foole</hi> to follow him, aswell as the <hi>begger.</hi>— By this time, your <hi>begger</hi> begins to waite close, who is return'd with the rest of his fellow bottle-men.— There they all drinke, saue ARGVRION, who is falne into a sodaine apoplexie.—</p>

                        <p>Troth no; he has two essentiall parts of the courtier, pride, and ignorance; mary, the rest come somewhat after the <hi>ordinarie</hi> gallant.

Hee lightly occupies the iesters roome at the table, and keepes <hi>laughter</hi> GELAIA (a wench in pages attire) following him in place of a squire, whom he now and then tickles with some strange ridiculous stuffe, vtter'd (as his land came to him) by chance. He will censure or discourse of any thing, but as absurdly as you would wish. His fashion is not to take knowledge of him that is beneath him in clothes. Hee neuer drinkes below the salt. Hee do's naturally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his wit, that weares gold-lace, or tissue. Stabs any man that speakes more contemptibly of the scholler then he. Hee is a great proficient in all the illiberall sciences, as cheating, drinking, swaggering, whoring, and such like: neuer kneeles but to pledge healths; nor prayes but for a pipe of pudding tabacco. He wil blaspheme in his shirt. The othes which hee vomits at one supper, would maintaine a towne of garrison in good swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a twelue-moneth. One other genuine qualitie he has, which crownes all these, and that is this: to a friend in want, hee will not depart with the waight of a soldred groat, lest the world might censure him prodigall, or report him a gull: mary, to his <hi>cockatrice</hi> or <hi>punquetto</hi>, halfe a dozen taffata

                        <p>Plant your selfe there, sir: and obserue me. You shall now, as well be the ocular, as the eare-witnesse, how cleerly I can refell that <hi>para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox</hi>, or rather <hi>pseudodox</hi>, of those, which hold the face to be the index of the mind, which (I assure you) is not so, in any politique creature: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. I will now giue you the particular, and distinct face of euery your most noted <hi>species</hi> of persons, as your marchant, your scholer, your soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier, your lawyer, courtier, &amp;c. and each of these so truly, as you would sweare, but that your eye shal see the variation of the lineament, it were my most proper, and genuine aspect. First, for your marchant, or citie-face, 'tis thus, a dull, plodding face, still looking in a direct line, forward: there is no great matter in this face. Then haue you your students, or <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademique</hi> face, which is here, an honest, simple, and methodicall face: but somewhat more spread then the former. The third is your souldiers face, a menacing, and astounding face, that lookes broad, and bigge: the grace of this face consisteth much in a beard. The <hi>anti-face</hi> to this, is your lawyers face, a contracted, subtile, and intricate face, full of quirkes, and turnings, a <hi>labyrinthaean</hi> face, now angularly, now circularly, euery way aspected. Next is your statists face, a serious, solemne, and supercilious face, full of formall, and square grauitie, the eye (for the most part) deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and artificially shadow'd: there is great iudgement required in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this face. But now, to come to your face of faces, or courtiers face, tis of three sorts, according to our subdiuision of a courtier, elementarie, practique, and theorique. Your courtier theorique, is hee, that hath ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riu'd to his fardest, and doth now know the court, rather by speculation, then practice; and this is his face: a fastidious and oblique face, that lookes, as it went with a vice, and were screw'd thus. Your courtier pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctike, is he, that is yet in his path, his course, his way, &amp; hath not toucht the <hi>puntilio</hi>, or point of his hopes; his face is here: a most promising, open,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:12766:113"/>
smooth, and ouer-flowing face, that seemes as it would runne, and powre it selfe into you. Somewhat a northerly face. Your courtier elementarie, is one but newly enter'd, or as it were in the <hi>alphabet</hi>, or <hi>vt-re-mi-fa-sol-la</hi> of courtship. Note well this face, for it is this you must practice.</p>

Therefore, if that can be made exactly, curiously, exquisitely, thorowly, it is inough: But (for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent) you shall only apply your selfe to this face of the elementarie cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, a light, reuelling, and protesting face, now blushing, now smiling, which you may helpe much with a wanton wagging of your head, thus, (a feather will teach you) or with kissing your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mary (before they met) he had other verie prettie sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which yet he retaines some light impression of: as frequenting a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing schoole, and grieuously torturing strangers, with inquisition after his grace in his galliard. He buyes a fresh acquaintance at any rate. His eye and his rayment confer much together as he goes in the street. He treades nicely, like the fellow that walkes vpon ropes; especially the first <hi>sunday</hi> of his silke-stockings: and when he is most neat, and new, you shall strip him with commendations.</p>

                        <p>CRITES. A creature of a most perfect and diuine temper. One, in whom the humours and elements are peaceably met, without emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of precedencie: he is neyther to phantastikely melancholy, too slowly phlegmaticke, too lightly sanguine, or too rashly cholericke, but in all, so composde &amp; order'd, as it is cleare, <hi>Nature</hi> went about some ful worke, she did more then make a man, when she made him. His discourse is like his behauiour, vncommon, but not vnpleasing; hee is prodigall of ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Hee striues rather to bee that which men call iudicious, then to bee thought so: and is so truly learned, that he affects not to shew it. Hee will thinke, and speake his thought, both freely: but as distant from deprauing another mans merit, as proclaiming his owne. For his valour, tis such, that he dares as little to offer an iniurie, as receiue one. In summe, he hath a most ingenuous and sweet spirit, a sharp and season'd wit, a straight iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a strong mind. <hi>Fortune</hi> could neuer breake him, nor make him lesse. He counts it his pleasure, to despise pleasures, and is more delighted with good deeds, then goods. It is a competencie to him that hee can bee vertuous. He doth neyther couet nor feare; hee hath too much reason to doe eyther: and that commends all things to him.</p>

When shee comes abroad, shee's more loose and scattering then dust, and will flie from place to place, as shee were rapt with a whirle-winde. Your yong student (for the most part) shee affects not, only salutes him, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: a <hi>poet</hi>, nor a <hi>philosopher</hi>, shee is hardly brought to take any notice of; no, though he be some part of an <hi>alchemist.</hi> Shee loues a <hi>player</hi> well, and a <hi>lawyer</hi> infinitely: but your foole aboue all.

HEDON'S a pretty slight courtier, and he weares his clothes well, and sometimes in fashion; Mary, his face is but indifferent, and he has no such excellent body. No, th'other is a most delicate youth, a sweet face, a streight body, a well proportion'd legge and foot, a white hand, a tender voice.</p>

                        <p>Who I? Let me see now. I would wish to be a wise woman, and know all the secrets of court, citie, and countrie. I would know what were done behind the arras, what vpon the staires, what i' the garden, what i' the <hi>Nymphs</hi> chamber, what by barge, &amp; what by coach. I would tel you which courtier were scabbed, and which not; which ladie had her owne face to lie with her a-nights, &amp; which not; who put off their teeth with their clothes in court, who their haire, who their complexion; and in which boxe they put it. There should not a <hi>Nymph</hi>, or a widdow be got with childe i' the verge, but I would guesse (within one or two,) who was the right father: and in what moneth it was gotten; with what words; and which way. I would tell you, which Madame lou'd a <hi>Monsieur</hi>, which a player, which a page; who slept with her husband, who with her friend, who with her gentleman-vsher, who with her horse-keeper, who with her monkie, and who with all. Yes, and who jigg'd the cocke too.</p>

Onely I would wish my selfe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more command, and soueraignetie; that all the court were subiect to my absolute becke, and all things in it depending on my looke; as if there were no other heauen, but in my smile, nor other hell, but in my frowne; that I might send for any man I list, and haue his head cut off, when I haue done with him; or made an <hi>eunuch</hi>, if he denyed mee: and if I saw a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                        <p>Faith, I cannot (readily) tell you what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But (mee thinkes) I should wish my selfe all manner of creatures. Now, I would bee an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse; and by and by a dutchesse; then a great ladie of state; then one of your <hi>miscelany</hi> madams; then a waiting-woman; then your cittizens wife; then a course countrey gentlewoman; then a deyrie maide; then a shepheards lasse; then an empresse againe, or the queene of <hi>fayries</hi>: And thus I would prooue the vicissitudes, and whirle of pleasures, about, and againe. As I were a shepheardesse, I would bee pip'd and sung too; as a deyrie wench, I would dance at <hi>may</hi>-poles, and make sillabubbes; As a countrey gentlewoman, keep a good house, and come vp to terme, to see motions; As a cittizens wife, bee troubled with a iealous husband, and put to my shifts; (others miseries should bee my pleasures) As a waiting-woman, I would taste my ladies delights to her; As a <hi>miscellany</hi> madame inuent new tyres, and goe visite courtiers; As a great ladie, lye a bed, and haue courtiers visite mee; As a dutchesse, I would keepe my state: and as an empresse, I'ld doe any thing. And, in all these shapes, I would euer bee follow'd with th' affections of all that see mee. Mary, I my selfe would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect none; or if I did, it should not bee heartily, but so as I might saue my selfe in 'hem still, and take pride in tormenting the poore wretches. Or, (now I thinke on't) I would, for one yeere, wish my selfe one woman, but the richest, fairest, and delicatest in a kingdome, the very center of wealth, and beautie, wherein all lines of loue should meet; and in that person I would prooue all manner of suters, of all humours, and of all complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and neuer haue any two of a sort: I would see how <hi>Loue</hi> (by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his object) could worke inwardly alike, in a cholericke man, and a sanguine; in a melancholique, and a phlegmatique; in a foole, and a wise man; in a clowne, and a courtier; in a valiant man, and a coward: and how he could varie outward, by letting this gallant expresse himselfe in dumbe gaze; another with sighing, and rubbing his fingers; a third, with play-ends, and pittifull verses; a fourth, with stabbing himselfe, and drinking healths, or writing languishing letters in his bloud; a fifth, in colour'd ribbands, and good clothes; with this lord to smile, and that lord to court, and the t'other lord to do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In which time (retyring my selfe into a bay-window) the beauteous ladie ANNABELL, neece to the Empresse, and sister to the King of <hi>Arragon</hi>, who hauing neuer before eyde mee, (but only heard the common report of my vertue, learning, and trauaile) fell into that extremitie of passion, for my loue, that shee there immediately swouned: physicians were sent for, she had to her chamber, so to her bed; where (languishing some few daies) after many times calling vpon me, with my name in her lips, she expirde. As that (I must mourningly say) is the onely fault of my fortune, that, as it hath euer beene my hap to be sew'd to, by all ladies, and beauties, where I haue come, so, I neuer yet sojourn'd, or rested in that place, or part of the world, where some high-borne admirable faire feature died not for my loue.</p>

A gentleman of so pleasing, and ridiculous a carriage; as, euen standing, carries meat in the mouth, you see; and I assure you, although no bred <hi>courtling</hi>, yet a most particular man, of goodly hauings, well fashion'd hauiour, and of as hard'ned, and excellent a barke, as the most naturally-qualified amongst them, inform'd, reform'd, and transform'd, from his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall citticisme, by this <hi>elixi'r</hi>, or meere <hi>magazine</hi> of man. And, for your spectators, you behold them, what they are: The most choice particulars in court: This tels tales well; This prouides coaches; This repeates iests; This presents gifts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This holds vp the arras; This takes downe from horse; This protests by this light; This sweares by that candle; This delighteth; This adoreth. Yet, all but three men. Then for your ladies, the most proud wittie creatures, all things apprehending, nothing vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, perpetually laughing, curious maintayners of fooles, mercers, and minstrels, costly to be kept, miserably keeping, all disdayning, but their painter, and pothecary, twixt whom and them there is this reciprock commerce, their beauties maintaine their painters, and their painters their beauties.</p>

                        <p>CLeare pearle of heauen, and, not to bee farther ambitious in titles, CYNTHIA. The same of this illustrous night, among others, hath also drawne these foure faire virgins from the palace of their Queene <hi>Perfection</hi> (a word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which makes no sufficient difference, twixt hers, and thine) to visit thy imperiall court: for she, their soueraigne, not finding where to dwell among men, before her returne to heauen, aduised them wholy to consecrate themselues to thy celestiall seruice, as in whose cleere spirit (the proper element, and sphere of vertues) they should behold not her alone, (their euer honour'd mistris) but themselues (more truly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues) to liue inthroniz'd. Her selfe would haue commended them vnto thy fauour more particularly, but that shee knowes no commendation is more auaileable with them, then that of proper vertue. Neuerthelesse, she will'd them to present this christall <hi>mound</hi>, a note of monarchie, and symbole of perfection, to thy more worthie <hi>deitie</hi>; which, as heere by me they most humbly doe, so amongst the rarities thereof, that is the chiefe, to shew whatsoeuer the world hath excellent, howsoeuer remote and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. But your irradiate iudgement will soone discouer the secrets of this little cristall world. Themselues (to appeare more plainely) because they know nothing more odious, then false pretexts, haue chosen to expresse
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:12766:142"/>
their seuerall qualities, thus, in seuerall colours.</p>
                        <p>The first, in citron colour, is <hi>naturall Affection</hi>, which giuen vs to procure our good, is somtime called STORGE, &amp; as euery one is neerest to himselfe, so this hand-maid of reason, <hi>allowable selfe-loue</hi>, as it is without harme, so are none without it: Her place in the court of <hi>Perfection</hi> was to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken mindes in the pursuit of honour. Her deuice is a <hi>perpendicular Leuell</hi>, vpon a <hi>Cube</hi>, or <hi>Square.</hi> The word, SE SVO MODVLO. Alluding to that true measure of ones selfe, which as euerie one ought to make, so is it most conspicuous in thy diuine example.</p>
                        <p>The second, in greene, is AGLAIA, <hi>delectable and pleasant Conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>, whose propertie is to moue a kindly delight, and sometime not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out laughter: Her office, to entertaine assemblies, and keepe societies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with faire familiaritie. Her deuice within <hi>a Ring of clouds, a Heart with shine about it.</hi> The word, CVRARVM NVEILA PELLO. An <hi>alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie</hi> of CYNTHIAES light, which no lesse cleares the skie, then her faire mirth the heart.</p>
                        <p>The third, in the discolour'd mantle spangled all ouer, is EVPHANTAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TE, <hi>a well conceited Wittinesse</hi>, and imployd in honouring the court with the riches of her pure inuention. Her deuice, vpon a <hi>Petasus</hi>, or <hi>Mercuriall</hi> hat, a <hi>Crescent.</hi> The word, SIC LAVS INGENII. Inferring, that the praise and glorie of wit, doth euer increase, as doth thy growing moone.</p>
                        <p>The fourth in white, is APHELEIA, a <hi>Nymph</hi> as pure and simple as the soule, or as an abrase table, and is therefore called <hi>Simplicitie</hi>, without folds, without pleights, without colour, without counterfeit: and (to speake plainly) <hi>Plainenesse</hi> it selfe. Her deuice is no deuice. The word vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her <hi>siluer Shield</hi>, OMNIS ABEST FVCVS. Alluding to thy spotlesse selfe, who art as farre from impuritie, as from mortalitie.</p>
                        <p>My selfe (celestiall Goddesse) more fit for the court of CYNTHIA, then the arbors of CYTHEREE, am call'd ANTEROS, or <hi>Loues enemie</hi>; the more welcome therefore to thy court, and the fitter to conduct this <hi>quaternion</hi>, who as they are thy professed votaries, and for that cause aduersaries to <hi>Loue</hi>, yet thee (perpetuall <hi>Virgin</hi>) they both loue, and vow to loue eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>

With these foure siluer iauelins (which they beare in their hands) they support in Princes courts the state of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, as by office they are obliged; which, though here they may seeme superfluous, yet, for honors sake, they thus presume to visite thee, hauing also beene emploid in the palace of Queene <hi>Perfection.</hi> And though to them, that would make themselues gracious to a Goddesse, sacrifices were fitter then presents, or <hi>Impreses</hi>, yet they both hope thy fauour; and (in place of either) vse seuerall <hi>Symboles</hi>, contayning the titles of thy impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall dignitie.</p>
                        <p>First, the hethermost, in the changeable blew, and greene robe, is the commendably-fashioned gallant, EVCOSMOS; whose courtly habite is the grace of the presence, and delight of the surueying eye: whom ladies vnderstand by the names of <hi>neate</hi>, and <hi>elegant.</hi> His <hi>symbole</hi> is, DIVAE VIRGINI, in which he would expresse thy <hi>deities</hi> principall glory, which hath euer beene <hi>virginitie.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second, in the rich acoutrement, and robe of purple, empaled with gold, is EVPATHES; who entertaynes his mind with an harmelesse, but not incurious varietie: All the obiects of his senses are sumptuous, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a gallant, that, without excesse, can make vse of superfluitie: goe richly in imbroideries, iewells (and what not?) without vanitie, and fare delicately without gluttonie: and therefore not (not without cause) is vniuersally thought to be of <hi>fiue humour.</hi> His <hi>Symbole</hi> is, DIVAE OP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIMAE. An attribute to expresse thy <hi>goodnesse</hi>, in which thou so resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest IOVE thy father.</p>
                        <p>The third, in the blush-colour'd sute, is, EVTOLMOS, as duely respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting others, as neuer neglecting himselfe; commonly knowne by the title of <hi>good as dacitie:</hi> to courts, and courtly assemblies, a guest most acceptable. His <hi>Symbole</hi> is, DIVAE VIRAGINI. To expresse thy <hi>hardy courage</hi>, in chase of sauage beasts, which harbour in woods, and wildernesse.</p>
                        <p>The fourth, in watchet tinsell, is the kind, and truly benefique EVCO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOS. Who imparteth not without respect, but yet without difficultie; and hath the happinesse to make euery kindnesse seeme double, by the
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:12766:143"/>
timely, and freely bestowing thereof. He is the chiefe of them, who (by the vulgar) are said to be of <hi>good nature.</hi> His <hi>Symbole</hi> is, DIVAE MAXI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAE. An adiunct to signifie thy <hi>greatnesse</hi>, which in heauen, earth, and hell is formidable.</p>

                        <l>Vnto his trauailes, then their reeling claps.</l>

                        <l>Then I would waste it in contemned strifes,</l>
                        <l>With these vile <hi>Ibides</hi>, these vncleane birds,</l>
                        <l>That make their mouthes their clysters, and still purge</l>
                        <l>From their hot entrailes. But, I leaue the monsters</l>

But since it hath beene our ease-full happinesse to enioy both the aides, and industrie of so vigilant a Senate, wee professe to haue beene the more indulgent to our pleasures, not as being carelesse of our office, but rather secure of the necessitie. Neyther doe these common rumors of many, and infamous libels, published against our retirement, at all afflict vs; being born more out of mens ignorance, then their malice: and will, neglected, finde their owne graue quickly; whereas too sensibly acknowledg'd, it would make their obloquie ours. Nor doe we desire their authors (though found) bee censur'd, since in a free state (as ours) all men ought to enioy both their mindes, and tongues free.</p>

For, if men will impartially, and not à-squint, looke toward the offices, and function of a Poet, they will easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to themselues, the impossibility of any mans being the good Poet, without first being a good man.

But, it will here be hastily answer'd, that the writers of these dayes are other things; that, not only their manners, but their natures are inuerted; and nothing remayning with them of the dignitie of Poet, but the abused name, which euery Scribe vsurps: that now, especially in <hi>dramatick</hi>, or (as they terme it) stage-<hi>poetrie</hi>, nothing but ribaldry, profanation, blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, all licence of offence to god, and man, is practis'd. I dare not denie a great part of this (and am sorry, I dare not) because in some mens abortiue features (and would they had neuer boasted the light) it is ouer-true: But, that all are embarqu'd in this bold aduenture for hell, is a most vncharitable thought, and, vtter'd, a more malicious slander.

Read therefore, I pray you, and censure. There is not a line, or syllable in it changed from the simplicity of the first Copy. And, when you shall consider, through the certaine hatred of some, how much a mans innocency may bee indanger'd by an vn-certaine accusation; you will, I doubt not, so beginne to hate the iniquitie of such natures, as I shall loue the contumely done me, whose end was so honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as to be wip'd off by your sentence.</p>

                  <l>Was to content the people; &amp; their praise</l>
                  <l>Was to the <hi>Poet</hi> money, wine, and bayes.</l>
                  <l>But in this age, a sect of writers are,</l>
                  <l>That, onely, for particular likings care,</l>
                  <l>And will taste nothing that is populare.</l>

                  <l>Are not to please the cookes tastes, but the guests.</l>
                  <l>Yet, if those cunning palates hether come,</l>
                  <l>They shall find guests entreaty, and good roome;</l>
                  <l>And though all relish not, sure, there will be some,</l>
                  <l>That, when they leaue their seates, shall make 'hem say,</l>
                  <l>Who wrot that piece, could so haue wroten a play:</l>
                  <l>But that, he knew, this was the better way.</l>

                  <l>Or to want bread, and salt, were but course art.</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Poet</hi> prayes you then, with better thought</l>
                  <l>To sit; and, when his cares are all in brought,</l>

But now, by reason of the sicknesse, the perpetuitie of ringing has made him deuise a roome, with double walls, and treble feelings; the windores close shut, and calk'd: and there he liues by candle-light. He turn'd away a man, last weeke, for hauing a paire of new shooes that creak'd. And this fellow waits on him, now, in tennis-court socks, or slippers sol'd with wooll: and they talke each to other, in a trunke. See, who comes here.</p>

                        <p>Alas, sir, I am but a messenger: I but tell you, what you must heare. It seemes, your friends are carefull after your soules health, sir, and would haue you know the danger (but you may doe your pleasure, for all them, I perswade not, sir) If, after you are married, your wife doe run away with a vaulter, or the <hi>Frenchman</hi> that walkes vpon ropes, or him that daunces the iig, or a sencer for his skill at his weapon, why it is not their fault; they haue discharged their consciences: when you know

what may happen. Nay, suffer valiantly, sir, for I must tell you, all the perills that you are obnoxious too. If shee be faire, yong, and vegetous, no sweet meats euer drew more flies; all the yellow doublets, and great roses i' the towne will bee there. If foule, and crooked, shee'll bee with them, and buy those doublets and roses, sir. If rich, and that you marry her dowry, not her; shee'll raigne in your house, as imperious as a widow. If noble, all her kindred will be your tyrannes. If fruitfull, as proud as <hi>May</hi>, and humorous as <hi>April</hi>; she must haue her doctors, her midwiues, her nurses, her longings euery houre: though it be for the dearest morsell of man. If learned, there was neuer such a parrat; all your patrimony will be too little for the guests, that must be inuited, to heare her speake <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi>: and you must lie with her in those languages too, if you will please her. If precise, you must feast all the silenc'd brethren, once in three daies; salute the sisters; entertaine the whole family, or wood of 'hem; and heare long-winded exercises, singings, and catechisings, which you are not giuen to, and yet must giue for: to please the zealous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron your wife, who, for the holy cause, will cosen you, ouer and aboue.

Then, you must keepe what seruants shee please; what company shee will; that friend must not visit you without her licence; and him shee loues most shee will seeme to hate eagerliest, to decline your ielousie; or, faigne to bee ielous of you first; and for that cause goe liue with her she-friend, or cosen at the colledge, that can instruct her in all the mysteries, of writing letters, corrupting seruants, taming spies; where shee must haue that rich goune for such a great day; a new one for the next; a richer for the third; bee seru'd in siluer; haue the chamber sill'd with a succession of groomes, foot-men, vshers, and other messengers; besides embroyderers, iewellers, tyre-women, sempsters, fether-men, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumers; while shee feeles not how the land drops away; nor the acres melt; nor forsees the change, when the mercer has your woods for her veluets; neuer weighes what her pride costs, sir: so shee may kisse a page, or a smoth chinne, that has the despaire of a beard; bee a states-woman, know all the newes, what was done at <hi>Salisbury</hi>, what at the <hi>Bath</hi>, what at court, what in progresse; or, so shee may censure <hi>poets</hi>, and authors, and stiles, and compare 'hem, DANIEL with SPENSER, IONSON with the tother youth, and so foorth; or, be thought cunning in controuersies, or the very knots of diuinitie; and haue, often in her mouth, the state of

                        <p>Yes faith; and thou shouldst hope otherwise, I should repent me: this horne got me entrance, kisse it. I had no other way to get in, but by faining to be a post; but when I got in once, I prou'd none, but rather the contrary, turn'd him into a post, or a stone, or what is stiffer, with thundring into him the incommodities of a wife, and the miseries of marriage. If euer GORGON were seene in the shape of a woman, hee hath seene her in my description. I hane put him off o'that sent, for euer. Wby doe you not applaud, and adore me, sirs? why stand you mute? Are you stupid? you are not worthy o'the benefit.</p>

This gentlewoman was lodg'd here by me o'purpose, and, to be put vpon my vncle, hath profest this obstinate silence for my sake, being my entire friend; and one, that for the requitall of such a fortune, as to marry him, would haue made mee very ample conditions: where now, all my hopes are vtterly miscaried by this vnlucky accident.</p>

Giue aside now a little, and leaue me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine her condition, and aptitude to my affection. Shee is exceeding faire, and of a speciall good fauour; a sweet composition, or harmony of limmes: her temper of beauty has the true height of my blood.

(—) Alasse, lady, these answers by silent curt'sies, from you, are too courtlesse, and simple.

Sirrah, conduct your mistris into the dining roome, your now—mistris. O my felicity! how I shall bee reueng'd on mine inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent kinsman, and his plots, to fright me from marrying!

Your knighthood it selfe shall come on it's knees, and it shall be reiected; it shall bee sued for it's fees to execution, and not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem'd; it shall cheat at the tweluepeny ordinary, it knighthood, for it's diet all the terme time, and tell tales for it in the vacation, to the hostesse: or it knighthood shall doe worse; take sanctuary in <hi>Coleharbor</hi>, and fast. It shall fright all it friends, with borrowing letters; and when one of the foure-score hath brought it knighthood ten shillings, it knighthood shall go to the Cranes, or the Beare at the <hi>Bridge</hi>-foot, and be drunk in feare: it shal not haue money to discharge one tauerne reckoning, to inuite the old creditors, to forbeare it knighthood; or the new, that should be, to trust it knighthood. It shall be the tenth name in the bond, to take vp the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie of pipkins, and stone jugs; and the part thereof shall not furnish it knighthood forth, for the attempting of a bakers widdow, a browne bakers widdow. It shall giue it knighthoods name, for a <hi>stallion</hi>, to all gamesome citizens wiues, and bee refus'd; when the master of a dancing schoole, or (<hi>How</hi> do you call him) the worst reueller in the towne is taken: it shall want clothes, and by reason of that, wit, to foole to lawyers. It shall not haue hope to repaire it selfe by <hi>Constantinople, Ireland</hi>, or <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi>; but the best, and last fortune to it knighthood shall be, to make DOL TEARE-SHEET, or KATE COMMON, a lady: and so, it knighthood may eate.</p>

a blacke satten gowne, as I stood by the fire, at my ladie CENTAVRES chamber in the colledge, another time. A third time, at the Lords masque, it dropt all my wire, and my ruffe with waxe-candle, that I could not goe vp to the banquet. A fourth time, as I was taking coach to goe to <hi>Ware</hi>, to meet a friend, it dash'd me a new sute all ouer (a crimson sattin doublet, and blacke veluet skirts) with a brewers horse, that I was faine to goe in and shift mee, and kept my chamber a leash of daies for the anguish of it.</p>

If shee be short, let her sit much, lest when shee stands, shee be thought to sit. If shee haue an ill foot, let her weare her gowne the longer, and her shoo the thinner. If a fat hand, and scald nailes, let her carue the lesse, and act in gloues. If a sowre breath, let

her neuer discourse fasting: and alwaies talke at her distance. If shee haue black and rugged teeth, let her offer the lesse at laughter, especially if shee laugh wide, and open.</p>

commit themselues to noble and worthy fellowes, run into the imbraces of a rascall. If shee loue wit, giue verses, though you borrow 'hem of a friend, or buy 'hem, to haue good. If valour, talke of your sword, and be frequent in the mention of quarrels, though you be staunch in fighting. If actiuitie, be seene o' your <hi>barbary</hi> often, or leaping ouer stooles, for the credit of your back. If shee loue good clothes or dressing, haue your lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned counsell about you euery morning, your <hi>french</hi> taylor, barber, lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nener, &amp;c. Let your poulder, your glasse, and your combe, be your dearest acquaintance. Take more care for the ornament of your head, then the safetie: and wish the common-wealth rather troubled, then a haire about you. That will take her. Then if shee be couetous and crauing, doe you promise any thing, and performe sparingly: so shall you keepe her in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite still. Seeme as you would giue, but be like a barren field that yeelds little, or vnlucky dice, to foolish, and hoping gamesters. Let your gifts be slight, and daintie, rather then pretious. Let cunning be aboue cost. Giue cherries at time of yeere, or apricots; and say they were sent you out o' the countrey, though you bought 'hem in <hi>Cheap-side.</hi> Admire her tyres; like her in all fashions; compare her in euery habit to some deitie; inuent excellent dreames to slatter her, and riddles; or, if shee bee a great one, performe alwaies the second parts to her: like what shee likes, praise whom she praises, and faile not to make the houshold and seruants yours, yea the whole family, and salute 'hem by their names: ('tis but light cost if you can purchase 'hem so) and make her physitian your pensioner, and her chiefe woman. Nor will it bee out of your gaine to make loue to her too, so shee follow, no vsher, her ladies pleasure.

                        <p>Not I, neuer in my life, broke iest vpon any man. The bride was praising sir DAVPHINE, and he went away in snuffe, and I followed him, vnlesse he tooke offence at me, in his drinke ere while, that I would not pledge all the horse full.</p>

and for her vses, shee loues all. Besides, her physitians giue her out to be
none o' the clearest, whether she pay 'hem or no, heau'n knowes: and she's
aboue fiftie too, and pargets! See her in a fore-noone. Here comes MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIS,

In short, that I should endeare my selfe to rest, and auoid turmoile: which now is growne to be another nature to me. So that I come not to your publike pleadings, or your places of noise; not that I neglect those things, that make for the dignitie of the common-wealth: but for the meere auoiding of clamors, &amp; impertinencies of Orators, that know not how to be silent. And for the cause of noise, am I now a sutor to you. You doe not know in what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie I haue beene exercis'd this day, what a torrent of euill! My very house turnes round with the tumult! I dwell in a wind-mill! The perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall motion is here, and not at <hi>Eltham.</hi>

                        <p>I answere then, the Canon-law affords diuorce but in few cases, and the principall is in the common case, the adulterous case. But there are <hi>duodecim impedimenta</hi>, twelue impediments (as we call 'hem) all which doe not <hi>dirimere contractum</hi>, but <hi>irritum reddere matrimonium</hi>, as wee say in the Canon-law, <hi>not take away the bond, but cause a nullitie therein.</hi>

                        <p>Well, DAVPHINE, you haue lurch'd your friends of the better halfe of the garland, by concealing this part of the plot! but much good doe it thee, thou deseru'st it, lad. And CLERIMONT, for thy vnexpected bringing in these two to confession, weare my part of it freely. Nay, sir DAW, and sir LA-FOOLE, you see the gentlewoman that has done you the fauours! we are all thankefull to you, and so should the woman-kind here, specially for lying on her, though not with her! You meant so, I am sure? But, that we haue stuck it vpon you to day, in your own imagin'd persons, and so lately; this <hi>Amazon</hi>, the champion of the sexe, should beate you now thriftily, for the common slanders, which ladies receiue from such cuckowes, as you are. You are they, that when no merit or fortune can make you hope to enioy their bodies, will yet lie with their reputations, and make their fame suffer. Away you common moths of these, and all ladies honors. Goe, trauaile to make legs and faces, and come home with some new matter to be laught at: you deserue to liue in an aire as corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as that wherewith you feed rumor. Madames, you are mute, vpon this new <hi>metamorphosis</hi>! but here stands shee, that has vindicated your fames. Take heed of such <hi>insectae</hi> hereafter. And let it not trouble you that you haue discouer'd any mysteries to this yong gentleman. He is (a'most) of yeeres, &amp; will make a good visitant within this twelue-month. In the meane time, wee'll all vndertake for his secrecie, that can speake so well of his silence. Spectators, if you like this <hi>comoedie</hi>, rise cheerefully, and now MOROSE is gone in, clap your hands. It may be, that noyse will cure him, at least please him.</p>

                     <l>For whom you stand; and to the present cause:</l>
                     <l>That this foule fact of LENTVLVS, and the rest,</l>

                     <l>And you be more indulgent to your passion,</l>

                     <l>I thinke it fit, to stay, where our lawes doe.</l>
                     <l>Poore pettie states may alter, vpon humour,</l>
                     <l>Where, if they' offend with anger, few doe know it,</l>
                     <l>Because they are obscure; their fame, and fortune</l>
                     <l>Is equall, and the same. But they, that are</l>

                     <l>All mankind knowes their actions. So wee see,</l>

                     <l>Nor doe I thinke his sentence cruell (for</l>

Vnder which name, I here offer to your Lo: the ripest of my studies, my <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammes;</hi> which, though they carry danger in the sound, doe not therefore seeke your shelter: For, when I made them, I had nothing in my conscience, to expressing of which I did need a cypher. But, if I be falne into those times, wherein, for the likenesse of vice, and facts, euery one thinks anothers ill deeds obiected to him; and that in their ignorant and guiltie mouthes, the common voyce is (for their securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) <hi>Beware the Poet</hi>, confessing, therein, so much loue to their diseases, as they would rather make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie for them, then be either rid, or told of them: I must expect, at your Lo: hand, the protection of truth, and
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:12766:410"/>
libertie, while you are constant to your owne goodnesse. In thankes whereof, I returne you the honor of leading forth so many good, and great names (as my verses mention on the better part) to their remembrance with posteritie. Amongst whom, if I haue praysed, vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately, any one, that doth not deserue; or, if all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere not, in all numbers, the pictures I haue made of them: I hope it will be forgiuen me, that they are no ill pieces, though they be not like the persons. But I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see a neerer fate to my booke, then this: that the vices therein will be own'd before the vertues (though, there, I haue auoyded all particulars, as I haue done names) and that some will be so readie to discredit me, as they will haue the impudence to belye themselues. For, if I meant them not, it is so. Nor, can I hope otherwise. For, why should they remit any thing of their riot, their pride, their selfe-loue, and other inherent graces, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider truth or vertue; but, with the trade of the world, lend their long eares against men they loue not: and hold their deare <hi>Mountebanke</hi>, or <hi>Iester</hi>, in farre better condition, then all the studie, or studiers of <hi>humanitie</hi>? For such, I would rather know them by their visards, still, then they should publish their faces, at their perill, in my <hi>Theater</hi>, where <hi>CATO</hi>, if he liu'd, might enter without scandall.</p>

                        <p>Retyre, you houshold-gods, and leaue these excellent creatures to be entertayned by a more eminent deitie. Hayle King, and Queene of the Islands, call'd truely fortunate, and by you made so; To tell you, who I am, and weare all these notable, and speaking ensignes about me, were to challenge you of most impossible ignorance, and accuse my selfe of as palpable glorie: It is inough that you know me here, and come with the licence of my father IOVE, who is the bountie of heauen, to giue you early welcome to the bower of my mother MAIA, no lesse the goodnesse of earth. And may it please you to walke, I will tell you no wonderfull storie. This place, whereon you are now aduanced (by the mightie power of <hi>Poetrie</hi>, and the helpe of a faith, that can remoue mountaynes) is the <hi>Arcadian</hi> hill CYLLENE, the place, where my selfe was both begot, and borne; and of which I am frequently call'd CYLLENIVS: Vnder yond' purslane tree stood sometime my cradle. Where, now, behold my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther MAIA, sitting in the pride of her plentie, gladding the aire with her breath, and cheering the spring with her smiles. At her feet, the blushing AVRORA, who, with her rosie hand, casteth her honie dewes on those sweeter herbs, accompanied with that gentle winde, FAVONIVS, whose subtile spirit, in the breathing forth, FLORA makes into flowers, and sticks them in the grasse, as if shee contended to haue the imbroyderie of the
<pb n="881" facs="tcp:12766:467"/>
earth, richer then the cope of the skie. Here, for her moneth, the yeere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delicate <hi>May</hi> keepes state; and from this <hi>Mount</hi>, takes pleasure to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play these valleyes, yon'd lesser hills, those statelier edifices, and towers, that seeme enamour'd so farre off, and are rear'd on end, to behold her, as if their vtmost obiect were her beauties. Hither the <hi>Dryads</hi> of the valley, and <hi>Nymphs</hi> of the great riuer come euery morning, to taste of her fauors; and depart away with laps fill'd with her bounties. But, see! vpon your approch their pleasures are instantly remitted. The birds are hush'd, ZE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHYRE is still, the MORNE forbeares her office, FLORA is dumbe, and herselfe amazed, to behold two such maruailes, that doe more adorne place, then shee can time; Pardon, your Maiestie, the fault, for it is that hath caus'd it; and till they can collect their spirits, thinke silence, and wonder the best adoration.</p>

And, it is better in me, to preuent his rusticke impudence, by my blushing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, then, anon, by his rude, and not insolent clayme, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to confesse him.

The place, about which they skip, is the fount of laughter, or BACCHVS spring; whose statue is aduanced on the top; and from whose pipes, at an obseru'd howre of the day, there flowes a lustie liquor, that hath the present vertue to expell sadnesse; and within certaine minutes after it is tasted, force all the myrth of the spleene into the face. Of this is PAN the Guardian. Loe! the fountain begins to run, but the Nymphes at your sight are fled. PAN, and his <hi>Satyres</hi> wildly stand at gaze. I will approach, and question him: vouchsafe your eare, and forgiue his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, which (euen to me, that am his parent) will no doubt be rude ynough, though otherwise full of salt, which, except my presence did temper, might turne to be gall, and bitternesse; but that shall charme him.</p>

On their heads they wore <hi>Persick</hi> crownes, that were with scroles of <hi>gold-plate</hi> turn'd outward, and wreath'd about with a <hi>carnation</hi> and <hi>siluer</hi> net-lawne; the one end of which hung carelesly on the left shoulder; the other was trick'd vp before, in seuerall degrees of foulds, betweene the plates, and set with rich iewels, and great pearle. Their bodies were of <hi>carnation</hi> cloth of siluer, richly wrought, and cut to expresse the <hi>naked</hi>, in manner of the <hi>Greeke Thorax</hi>; girt vnder the brests with a broad <hi>belt</hi> of cloth of gold, imbrodered, and fastened before with iewels: Their Labels were of <hi>white</hi> cloth of siluer, lac'd, and wrought curiously betweene, sutable to the vpper halfe of their sleeues; whose nether parts, with their bases, were of <hi>watchet</hi> cloth of siluer, chev'rond all ouer with lace. Their Mantills were of seuerall colour'd silkes, distinguishing their qualities, as they were coupled in payres; the first, <hi>skie colour</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the second, <hi>pearle colour</hi>; the third, <hi>flame colour</hi>; the fourth, <hi>tawnie:</hi> and these cut in leaues, which were subtilly tack'd vp, and imbrodered with <hi>Oe's</hi>, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene euerie ranke of leaues, a broad siluer lace. They were fastened on the right shoulder, and fell compasse downe the back in gracious folds, and were againe tyed with a round knot, to the fastning of their swords. Vpon their legges they wore <hi>siluer</hi> Greaues, answering in worke to their Labells; and these were their <hi>accoutrements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ladies <hi>attyre</hi> was wholly new, for the inuention, and full of glorie; as hauing in it the most true impression of a <hi>celestiall</hi> figure: the vpper part of <hi>white</hi> cloth of siluer, wrought with IVNOES <hi>birds</hi> and <hi>fruits</hi>; a loose vnder-garment, full gather'd, of <hi>carnation</hi>, strip't with <hi>siluer</hi>, and parted with a golden <hi>Zone:</hi> beneath that, another flowing garment, of <hi>watchet</hi> cloth of siluer, lac'd with gold; through all which, though they were round, and swelling, there yet appeared some touch of their delicate <hi>lineaments</hi>, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing the sweetnesse of <hi>proportion</hi>, and expressing it selfe beyond expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. The <hi>attyre</hi> of their heads did answer, if not exceed; their haire being carelesly (but yet with more art, then if more affected) bound vnder the circle of a rare and rich <hi>Coronet</hi>, adorn'd with all varietie, and choise of iewels; from the top of which, flow'd a transparent <hi>veile</hi>, downe to the ground; whose verge, returning vp, was fastened to either side in most sprightly manner. Their shooes were <hi>Azure</hi>, and gold, set with Rubies and Diamonds; so were all their garments; and euerie part abounding in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament.</p>
                  <p>No lesse to be admir'd, for the grace, and greatnesse, was the whole <hi>Machine</hi> of the <hi>Spectacle</hi>, from whence they came: the first part of which
<pb n="927" facs="tcp:12766:492"/>
was a MIKPOKOΣMOΣ, or <hi>Globe</hi>, fill'd with <hi>Countreys</hi>, and those gilded; where the <hi>Sea</hi> was exprest, heightned with siluer waues. This stood, or rather hung (for no <hi>Axell</hi> was seene to support it) and turning softly, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the first <hi>Masque</hi> (as wee haue before, but too runningly declared) which was of the <hi>men</hi>, sitting in faire <hi>composition</hi>, within a <hi>mine</hi> of seuerall metalls: To which, the lights were so placed, as no one was seene; but seemed, as if onely REASON, with the splendor of her crowne, illumin'd the whole Grot.</p>
                  <p>On the sides of this (which began the other part) were placed two great <hi>Statues</hi>, fayned of gold, one of ATLAS, the other of HERCVLES, in varied postures, bearing vp the Clouds, which were of <hi>Releue</hi>, embossed, and tralucent, as Naturalls: To these, a cortine of painted clouds ioyned, which reach'd to the vpmost roofe of the Hall; and sodainely opening, reueal'd the three <hi>Regions</hi> of <hi>Ayre:</hi> In the highest of which, sate IVNO, in a glorious throne of gold, circled with <hi>Comets</hi>, and fierie <hi>Meteors</hi>, engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in that hot and drie <hi>Region</hi>; her feet reaching to the lowest: where, was made a <hi>Rainebow</hi>, and within it, <hi>Musicians</hi> seated, figuring <hi>airie</hi> spirits, their habits various, and resembling the seuerall colours, caused in that part of the <hi>aire</hi> by reflexion. The midst was all of darke and condensed clouds, as being the proper place, where <hi>Raine, Haile</hi>, and other watrie <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors</hi> are made; out of which, two concaue clouds, from the rest, thrust forth themselues (in nature of those <hi>Nimbi</hi>, wherein, by <hi>Homer, Virgil</hi>, &amp;c. the <hi>gods</hi> are fain'd to descend) and these carried the eight <hi>Ladies</hi>, ouer the heads of the two <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Atlas</hi>, and <hi>Hercules</hi>, the Figures men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before.</note> 
                     <hi>Termes</hi>; who (as the engine mou'd) seem'd also to bow themselues (by vertue of their shadowes) and discharge their shoulders of their glorious burden: when, hauing set them on the earth, both they and the clouds gathered themselues vp againe, with some rapture of the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that, which (as aboue in place, so in the beautie) was most taking in the <hi>Spectacle</hi>, was the <hi>sphere</hi> of <hi>fire</hi>, in the top of all, encompassing the <hi>ayre</hi>, and imitated with such art and industrie, as the <hi>spectators</hi> might discerne the Motion (all the time the <hi>Shewes</hi> lasted) without any Moouer; and that so swift, as no eye could distinguish any colour of the light, but might forme to it selfe fiue hundred seuerall hiewes, out of the tralucent bodie of the <hi>ayre</hi>, obiected betwixt it, and them.</p>
                  <p>And this was crown'd with a statue of IVPITER, the <hi>Thunderer.</hi>

Sir, would you beleeue, it should be come to that height of impudence, in mankind, that such a nest of fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wormes, as these are (because their Patron <hi>Mulciber</hi> heretofore has made

stooles stirre, and statues dance, a dog of brasse to barke, and (which some will say, was his worst acte, a woman to speake) should therefore with their heats cal'd <hi>Balnei, cineris</hi>, or horse-doung, professe to outworke the <hi>Sunne</hi> in vertue, and contend to the great act of generation, nay, almost creation? it is so, though. For, in yonder vessels which you see, in their laboratorie, they haue inclos'd <hi>Materials</hi>, to produce men, beyond the deedes of <hi>Deucalion</hi>, or <hi>Prometheus</hi> (of which, one, they say, had the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> stone, and threw it ouer his shoulder, the other the fire, and lost it.)

I can remember some o' their titles to you, and the ingredients doe not looke for <hi>Paracelsus</hi> man among 'hem, that he promised you out of white bread, and dele-wine, for hee neuer came to light. But of these, let me see; the first that occurres; a master of the <hi>Duel</hi>, a carrier of the differencies. To him went spirit of ale, a good quantitie, with the amalgama of sugar and nutmegs, oyle of othes, sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phure of quarrell, strong waters, valour precipitate, vapor'd o're the helme with tobacco, and the rosin of <hi>Mars</hi> with a dram o'the businesse, for that's the word of tincture, the businesse. Let me alone with the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, I will carrie the businesse. I doe vnderstand the businesse. I doe finde an affront i' the businesse. Then another is a fencer i' the <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques</hi>, or the townes-cunning-man, a creature of arte too; a supposed secretary to the starres; but, indeed, a kind of lying <hi>Intelligencer</hi> from those parts. His materials, if I be not deceiu'd, were iuyce of almanacks, extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Ephemerides</hi>, scales of the <hi>Globe</hi>, fylings of figures, dust o'the twelue houses, conserue of questions, salt of confederacy, a pound of aduenture, a graine of skill, and a drop of trueth. I saw vegitals too, aswell as mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, put into one glasse there, as adders tongue, title-bane, nitre of clyents, tartar of false conueyance, <hi>Aurum palpabile</hi>, with a huge deale of talke, to which they added tincture of conscience, with the faces of honesty; but for what this was, I could not learne; onely I haue ouer-heard one o' the <hi>Artists</hi> say, Out o'the corruption of a Lawyer was the best generation of a Broker in suits: whether this were he or no, I know not.</p>
