            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>SInce the publishing my late <hi>View,</hi> &amp;c. I have been plentifully rail'd on in Print: This gives me some reason to suspect the <hi>Answerers</hi> and the Cause, are not altogether unlike. Had there been nothing but plain Argument to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, I think I might have ventured my Book with them: But being charged with mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations and unfair Dealing, 'twas requisite to say something: For Honesty is a tender point, and ought not to be neglected.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> and the Author of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse,</hi> being the most eager Complainants, and <hi>Principals</hi> in the Dispute, I have made it my choice to satisfie them. As for the <hi>Volunteers,</hi> they will find themselves affected with the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of their Friends; and besides, I may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have an opportunity of speaking farther with them hereafter.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the singular Management of the <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Play-House,</hi> I have had the satisfaction to perceive, the Interest of Virtue is not altogether Sunk, but that Conscience and Modesty have still some Footing among us. This consideration makes me hope a little farther Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the Stage may not be unacceptable. The <hi>Reader</hi> then may please to take notice, that The <hi>Plot and no Plot</hi> swears at length, and is scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalously
<pb facs="tcp:54373:3"/>
Smutty and Profane. The <hi>Fool in Fashion</hi> for the first four Acts is liable to the same Imputation: Something in Swearing aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Caesar Borgia,</hi> and <hi>Love in a Nunnery,</hi> are no better Complexion'd than the former. And lastly, <hi>Limberham,</hi> and the <hi>Soldier's Fortune,</hi> are meer prodigies of Lewdness and Irreligion. If this general Accusation appears too hard, I am ready to make it good. 'Twere easy to proceed to many other <hi>Plays,</hi> but possibly this Place may not be so proper to enlarge upon the Subject.</p>
            <p>Some of the <hi>Stage-Advocates</hi> pretend my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on their Poetry are forreign to the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. On the contrary, I conceive it very defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to disarm an Adversary, if it may be, and disable him from doing Mischief.</p>
            <p>To expose that which would expose Religion, is a warrantable way of Reprizals. Those who Paint for Debauchery, should have the Fucus pull'd off, and the Coarseness underneath disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd. The Poets are the Aggressors, let them lay down their Arms first. We have suffer'd under Silence a great while; If we are in any fault, 'tis because we began with them no sooner</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO Mr. CONGREVE's Amendments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>MR. <hi>Congreve</hi> being a Person of no great Ceremony, I shan't salute him with any Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but fall to the Business without more Ado. This Gentleman pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to turn some of my Expressions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. <hi>If these Passages,</hi> says he, <hi>produced by</hi> Mr. <hi>Collier</hi> are <hi>obscene</hi> and <hi>profane,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amend.</hi> p. 5.</note> 
               <q>why are they raked in and disturb'd, unless it be to conjure up Vice, and revive Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> I can't think Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> so injudicious as to believe this Citation a jot to his purpose. But I plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive he Presumes all along upon the weakness, or partiality of his <hi>Reader:</hi> Which by the way, is no great Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54373:4"/>
However, to say something di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly. Had <hi>these</hi> obnoxious <hi>Passages</hi> lain hid in a Learned Language, and been lock'd up in Latin, like <hi>Iuvenal,</hi> I would no more have let them loose in a <hi>Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> than unchain'd the <hi>Tyger</hi> at <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew Fair:</hi> But since the Mischief works in <hi>English,</hi> 't<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s time to think of an <hi>English</hi> Remedy. B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>des, as to the Smut, I have endeavour'd not to disoblige the <hi>Paper</hi> with any of it. But to show the Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion just, I made a general Reference to <hi>Play,</hi> and <hi>Character:</hi> And sometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a special Occasion; have mark'd the <hi>Page.</hi> Indeed to have transcrib'd it at length, would not only have been an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper, but a tedious Employment.</p>
            <p>I was sensible the <hi>Poets</hi> would try to make their Advantage, of this Necessary Reserv'dness, that They would deny the <hi>Fact,</hi> because the Proof was not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and spoken out. But since the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> is directed to the Evidence, he may disappoint them in this Evasion, if he pleases. The profane Part, tho' Bolder, and more Black, will bear the Light bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore when 'twas clear of Obscenity, I have set it to the <hi>Bar.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole; I was willing to Guard the Virtue, and awaken the Caution of the <hi>Reader:</hi> And by the safest Methods
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54373:4"/>
I could think of, to give check to the Complicated Infection.</p>
            <p>He affirms I call the <hi>Stage-Poets,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Amend.</hi> p. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foons</hi> and <hi>Slaves</hi>; for this he Quotes 81, 63, and 175 Pages of the <hi>View,</hi> &amp;c. Let us examine his Proof: The place in the 63 <hi>Page</hi> is a Censure of a Profane and Smutty Passage in the <hi>Old Batchelour:</hi> In which I have said that <hi>Fondlewife</hi>'s making Sport with Adultery, in the manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd, was a Fit of Buffoonry and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness. Now to say this of a <hi>Character</hi> in the <hi>Play,</hi> is I suppose pretty Different from calling the <hi>Poet</hi> Buffoon. In the 81 <hi>Page,</hi> after I had produced a large Roll of Blasphemy, and <hi>Scripture</hi>-Abuse against the <hi>Stage</hi>; I thought I had reason to be somewhat concern'd; to see the Christian Religion thus horribly outraged, <hi>made the Diversion</hi> of the <hi>Town,</hi> and the <hi>scorn</hi> of <hi>Buffoons:</hi> I'm mistaken if this Occasion would not justify a little severity of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: And till Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Charge, he had much better Repent, than Complain: However there's no necessity he should take that Word to himself, unless he thinks he deserves it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For it may be applied to the <hi>Actors,</hi> or some few <hi>Libertines</hi> in the <hi>Audience,</hi> and then his Objection is spoil'd. His</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54373:5"/>3<hi>d.</hi> Instance stands in <hi>Page</hi> 175<hi>th</hi> of the <hi>View,</hi> &amp;c. Here upon their unpresi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented Familiarity with the <hi>Lords</hi>; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to know whether our <hi>Stage</hi> had <hi>a particular Privilege? Was their Charter enlarg'd</hi>; and were they on the <hi>same Foot of Freedom with the Slaves in</hi> the <hi>Saturna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia?</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> is positive I call the <hi>Poets Slaves:</hi> 'Tis well when his Hand was in; He did not charge me with calling them <hi>Saturnalia:</hi> But which way do I call them <hi>Slaves?</hi> Why because I said, They were very Free. Is Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty then always fasten'd to a Chain; and Familiarity a proof of Servitude? The Resemblance in the Question respects Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour more than Condition, and implies nothing farther than general Inequality. Now I hope 'tis no affront to the <hi>Stage,</hi> to suppose them Inferior to the <hi>House of Lords.</hi> His remaining Instance from my <hi>Preface,</hi> is much like This; and requires no farther Answer.</p>
            <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> may perceive I have call'd him no <hi>Names</hi> hitherto; But now he may be assured I should have distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd his Character a little, and paid him some proper Acknowledgments, but that I have no Inclination for his way of Disputing: Railing is a mean, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Talent, and oftentimes a sign of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54373:5"/>
a desperate Cause, and a desperate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <p>As to the bad Imputations these <hi>Stage</hi>-Advocates would throw upon me, I am not in the least disturb'd at Them. I thank God, they are not only without Truth, but without Colour. Could They have made the Slander passable, we should have heard farther from them. This is an admirable way of answering Books! All that I shall say to't is, that I pity the Men, and despite the Malice. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> is now making <hi>Out-works</hi> to fortify the Garison. He lays down four Rules as the Test of Criticism and Comedy.<note place="margin">p. 7. P. 12.</note> These He calls <hi>Postulata,</hi> as if they were Principles of <hi>Science,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Evidence of an <hi>Axiom.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he has spent some <hi>Pages</hi> in setting down these Demonstrative Things, he frankly tells us, they <hi>seem at first Sight</hi> to <hi>comprehend</hi> a <hi>Latitude.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Do they so? Then they are not Self-evident; They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualifyed for the Post he has put them in; and prove nothing but Sophistry and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerdemain. Well!

            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> Immodesty and lewd Talking, is another part of Vice which ought not to appear in <hi>Comedy.

            </p>
            <p>But supposing <hi>Aristotle</hi> more liberal to Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> what service would it do him? Does not Christianity refine the Pleasures, and abridge the Liberties of <hi>Heathenism</hi>?<note place="margin">

            <p>Thus we see his first <hi>Postulatum</hi> is far from being true in the Generality stated by him.</p>
            <p>Before I part with him on this Head, I can't but take notice of his saying,<note place="margin">P. 8.</note> that <hi>the Business of Comedy is to delight, as well as instruct</hi>: If he means as much, by <hi>as well,</hi>
               <note place="margin">View, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cap. 4.</note> he is mistaken. For Delight is but the secondary End of <hi>Comedy,</hi> as I have prov'd at large. And to satisfy him far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I'll give him one Testimony more of Mr. <hi>Dryden's.</hi> 'Tis in his <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Fresnoy's Art of Painting.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. XX.</note> Here he informs us that as to Delight <hi>the parallel of the</hi> (two) <hi>Arts holds true; with this difference; That the principal End of Painting is to please, and the chief design of Poetry is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s first Rule signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies little; And therefore his <hi>Second</hi> being, but a consequence of it, must fall of Course. <hi>Pleasure,</hi> especially the Pleasure of <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> is not the Supreme <hi>Law of Comedy.</hi>

Vice must be under Discipline and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenance, and Folly shown with great Caution and Reserve. Lussious Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Common Places of Lewdness are unpardonable. They affront the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and debauch the unwary, and are a scandal to the Country where they are suffer'd. The pretence of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Imitation,</hi> is a lamentable Plea. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt there's a great deal of <hi>Nature</hi> in the most brutal Practices. The infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Stews</hi> 'tis likely talk in their own way, and keep up to their Character.

               <note place="margin">Amend. p. 11.</note> 
               <hi>But when they are otherwise applied, the Diversity of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54373:9"/>
gives a Diversity of Signification:</hi> By his favour this Distinction is loose, and nothing to the Purpose. The inspired Text is appropriated to <hi>Sacred Things,</hi> and never to be used but upon serious Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions. The Weight of the Matter, and the Dignity of the Author, challenge our utmost regard. 'Tis only for the Service of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and Privileged from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Use. But Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> says <hi>when they</hi> (the Words of Scripture) <hi>are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise applied, the Diversity of the Subject gives a Diversity of Signification.</hi> This is strange Stuff! Has Application so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming a Quality, and does bare use en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so far into the Nature of Things? If a Man applies his Money to an ill Purpose, does this transmute the Metal, and make it none of the Kings Coin? To wrest an Author, and turn his Words into Jest, is it seems to have nothing to do with him. The meer Ridicule destroys the Quotation; and makes it belong to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Person. Thus 'tis impossible to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verstie a Book, and <hi>Virgil</hi> was never bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesqu'd by <hi>Ausonius</hi> or Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>! Not at all! They only made use of the 24 Letters, and happen'd to chop exactly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Subject, his Words and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sification. But 'tis plain they never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to quote him: For <hi>Virgil</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54373:9"/>
grave, and serious, but these Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men apply, or translate the Words in the most different manner imaginable: And run always upon Buffoonry and Drolling. This is Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s Logick, and to abuse an Author is to have nothing to do with him. The Injury it seems destroys the Relation, and makes the Action perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreign. And by this Reasoning one would think my Book had never been cited by Mr. <hi>Congreve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To illustrate the Matter a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Suppose the most solemn Acts of Government play'd the Fool with at <hi>Bartholomew Fair</hi>; The Judges <hi>Charge</hi> made up into a <hi>Farce,</hi> and the <hi>Poppets</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating an <hi>Act of Parliament:</hi> Would it be a good excuse to alledge they meant nothing but a little Laughing. That the <hi>Bench</hi> and the <hi>Bear-Garden, Punchinello</hi> and the 2 <hi>Houses,</hi> had the <hi>same Alphabet in Common?</hi> That they ought to have the Privilege of Speech, and put their <hi>Words</hi> together as they had a mind to: Would not the Reason, and the Hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of such a Plea, be very extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? The Case before us is much the same, only a great deal worse. For what can be more outrageously Wicked,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Old Batch.</hi> p. 39.49.</note> than to expose Religion to the Scorn of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism, to give up the Bible to <hi>Rakes</hi> and

Thus the Wisdom of God is burlesqu'd, his Omnipotence play'd with, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's the Diversion of Hell. To reply, that tho' the <hi>Words are Scripture, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Application are different,</hi> is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the Indictment, and give up the Cause. For pray what is it to burlesque a grave Author? Is it not to wrest his Meaning, and alter his Matter; to turn him into Jest and Levity, and put him under Circumstances of Contempt?</p>
            <p>Thus we see his 4<hi>th</hi> Proposition is all Sophistry, and false Reasoning:</p>
            <p>I shall now go back to his 3<hi>d,</hi> which I think would have stood as well in the last place. He <hi>desires the impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not to consider any Expression or Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, cited from any Play, as it appears in</hi> my Book;<note place="margin">P. 9.10.</note> 
               <hi>nor to pass any Sentence upon it out of its proper Scene,</hi> &amp;c. For it must not be medled with <hi>when 'tis alienated from its Character.</hi> Well! Let the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> compare his <hi>Plays</hi> with the <hi>View,</hi> &amp;c. as much as he pleases. However, there's no necessity of passing through all his Forms, and Methods of prescribing. For if the Passage be truly cited, if the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be full, and determin'd, why mayn't we understand it where'ere 'tis met with?
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54373:10"/>
Why must we read a Page for a Period? Can't a Plant be known without the History of the Garden? Besides, He may remember I have frequently hinted his <hi>Characters,</hi> touched upon their Quality and Fortune, and made them an Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his Fault.</p>
            <p>But to silence this Plea, I had told him before that no pretence of Character, or Punishment, could justify Profaneness on the <hi>Stage.</hi>
               <note place="margin">View. p. 96.</note> I gave him my Reasons for't too, which he is not pleas'd to take notice of. To enlarge on them a little:</p>
            <p>And here I desire to know what Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice does Blasphemy, and Profaneness up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Stage</hi>? Is it to please, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Audience? Surely not the first: For what Pleasure can it be to see the greatest Being contemn'd, the best Friend ill treated, and the strongest Enemy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd? The <hi>Iews</hi> used to rend their Cloaths at the hearing of Blasphemy, and is it now become the Entertainment of Christians? To see Men defy the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and play with Thunder, one would think should be far from Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Are the Charms of Profaneness so strangely inviting, is there such Musick in an Oath, and are the Damn'd to be courted for their Company? The <hi>Stage</hi> is oftentimes a lively Emblem of Hell;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54373:11"/>
There's the Language, and the Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; There are the Devils too, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most every thing but the Darkness and Despair. These hideous Characters are generally Persons of Figure, often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, seldom punish'd, and when they are, the Correction is strangely gentle and disproportion'd. 'Tis just as if a Man should be set in the <hi>Stocks</hi> for Murther, and shamed a little for firing a Town.</p>
            <p>To say a Man has been Profane in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and then to punish him is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Intelligible; To make him an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample without Instance, and Particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is a safe way of Dramatick Justice: But when he is suffer'd to Act his Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and practise before the Company, the Punishment comes too late. Such Malefactors are infectious, and kill at their very Execution. 'Tis much safer not to hear them talk, than to see them suffer. A bad Age is too apt to learn; and the Punishment in jest, brings on the Crime in earnest. Some Vices wont bear the naming: They are acted in some measure when they are spoken, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd when they are hearkn'd to. Thus the <hi>Play-House</hi> often spreads those Vices it represents, and the Humour of the <hi>Town</hi> is learn'd by shewing it. So that if Instruction is intended, nothing can be

However, by his favour, the Characters in a <hi>Play</hi> ought to be drawn by Nature: To write otherwise is to make a Farce. The <hi>Stage</hi> therefore must be suppos'd an Image of the World, and Quality in Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction resemble Quality in Life. This Resemblance should likewise hold in Number, as well as in other Respects, tho' not to a Mathematical Strictness. Thus in <hi>Plautus</hi> and <hi>Terence,</hi> the <hi>Slaves</hi> are generally represented false, and the Old Men easy and over credulous. Now if the Majority in these Divisions should not answer to the <hi>World</hi>; If the <hi>Drama</hi> should cross upon <hi>Conversation,</hi> the <hi>Poets</hi> would be to blame, as I believe they are in the later Instance.

The Eye is much more affecting, and strikes deeper into the Memory than the Ear. Besides, Upon the <hi>Stage</hi> both the Senses are in Conjunction. The Life of the Action fortifies the Object, and awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Mind to take hold of it. Thus a dramatick Abuse is rivetted in the <hi>Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> a Jest is improv'd into an Argument, and rallying grows up into Reason: Thus a Character of Scandal becomes almost indelible, a Man goes for a Blockhead up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Content</hi>; and he that's made a Fool in a <hi>Play,</hi> is often made one for his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. 'Tis true he passes for such only amongst the prejudiced and unthinking; but these are no inconsiderable Division of Mankind. For these Reasons, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive the <hi>Stage</hi> stands in need of a great deal of Discipline and Restraint: To give them an unlimited Range, is in effect to make them Masters of all Moral Distinctions, and to lay Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at their Mercy. To shew Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness ridiculous, is the way to lose the use, and abate the value of the Quality.

But after all, if <hi>Rapin</hi> has mis-reported <hi>Moliere,</hi> and given him more Liberty than he took, it makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s purpose; for the force of the Testimony does not lye in what <hi>Rapin</hi> has said, but in what <hi>Moliere</hi> has written.</p>

               <hi>Mr. Congreve</hi> is so hardy as to affirm that <hi>I am in plain terms for having Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements pass'd on Persons of Quality, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will allow their Follies, nor their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be exposed.</hi> This I confess is to be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54373:18"/>
over-Ceremonious. But the best on't is, there's nothing like it in the whole Book. The very place quoted by Mr. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieve</hi> is a proof of the Calumny: The Passage stands in the Form of a question thus.<note place="margin">View, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 175.</note>

I would gladly know what over-straining of Ceremony, What Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is there in all this? I confess, I am of Opinion that all <hi>Satyr</hi> ought to have regard to Quality and Condition, and that Decency and Reproof should go together. I can't think it any <hi>Excellence of good Manners,</hi> to expose the <hi>Nobility</hi> in their <hi>Robes,</hi> to put Contempt among their Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and to represent them in such a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as if the Lord and the Fool, like Horse and Man, in a <hi>Centaur,</hi> grew naturally together.</p>

Why then does he find fault with this Reservedness? Is he sorry his Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies are conceal'd, and grown proud of his Misbehaviour?</p>
            <p>We are now with the <hi>Old Batchelour,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> pretends I'm unfair in not citing <hi>Bellmour</hi> more at length. He says I conclude <hi>with a dash, as if both the Sense and the Words of the whole Sentence were at an end.</hi> Just the contrary. I made a dash — to shew there was something more spoken: But though the <hi>Sentence</hi> was not at an end, the <hi>Sense</hi> was; as appears from the Words, the Pointing, and the <hi>Capital Letter</hi> which follows. Let's see a little farther, if this Gentleman
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54373:23"/>
has received any harm. <hi>Bellmour</hi> is now talking to <hi>Vainlove.</hi>

            </sp>
            <p>
               <hi>Vainlove</hi> replies in a very pious questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</p>

                  <hi>Hum, not immediately in my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, not heartily:—I'd do a little more good in my generation first in order to deserve it.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>He would do a little more good first, <hi>i. e.</hi> He would gladly be a Libertine some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what longer, and merit Heaven by a more finish'd course of Debauchery. Thus we are taught to interpret <hi>Bellmour</hi> by the <hi>Old Batchelour</hi> and the <hi>Amendments,</hi> &amp;c. He is very lewd in the progress of the <hi>Play,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amend. p. 38.</note> and Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> grants, <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents the Character of a wild Debauchee of the Town; and that the expression is light, and suited accordingly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a good hearty Confession, and a sufficient proof, that if I had quoted more Words, I had quoted more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness; and therefore Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> has reason to thank me for being Brief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:54373:24"/>Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> drops the Defence of <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlewife,</hi> and makes Merry with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment.<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 39.</note> His excuse is, he was <hi>very much a Boy when this Comedy was written.</hi> Not unlikely. He and his Muse might probably be Minors; but the Libertines there are full grown. But why should the <hi>Man</hi> laugh at the Mischief of the <hi>Boy,</hi> why should he <hi>publish</hi> the Disorders of his Nonage? and make them his own by an after Approbation?

               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> What his Disease was I am not to enquire; but it must be a very ill one, to be worse than the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. The Writing of that Play is a very dangerous Amusement either for <hi>Sickness,</hi> or Health, or I'm much mistaken.</p>

            <p>His next Attempt is to bring off <hi>Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> who <hi>Kisses</hi> the Strumpet <hi>Laetitia,</hi> and tells her, <hi>Eternity was in that Moment.</hi> Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s Answer is very surprising He tells us, To say <hi>Eternity is in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is neither good nor bad, for 'tis stark Nonsense.</hi>

               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:54373:24"/>By his favour, the matter is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. If Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> will have patience, he shall speak Nonsense by and by; and to make it the less a fault, he shall do it unwillingly.</p>
            <p>Whether this Gentleman borrow'd this Sentence, or made it, I can't tell; but there's just such another in <hi>Love Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant</hi>; where upon such an occasion,<note place="margin">p. 34.</note> 
               <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso</hi> tells <hi>Victoria:</hi>
               <q>
                  <p>That Moment were Eternity in little.</p>
               </q>
Now if Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> has not a mind
to speak Sense, I hope Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> may
have leave to do so. However, we'll
prove our Right, and not stand to his
<hi>Courtesie.</hi> Now to say of an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
that <hi>Eternity was in that Moment,</hi>
is by common Interpretation meant, the
Pleasure of Eternity. The Satisfaction is
suppos'd to be so great, that what is lost
in the Duration, is made up in the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
This in the present Application is
hideously Profane; but the sense and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Fxpression is intelligible enough.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> in the close of this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gragh is somewhat extraordinary. He pronounces the Citation <hi>stark Nonsense,</hi> and frankly declares, he <hi>had not cared though I had discover'd it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 41.</note> I think I have discover'd it somewhat worse. However, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54373:25"/>
at his being so Resign'd. What not care to have stark Nonsense found upon him; Not in a Printed <hi>Play,</hi> and in the Mouth of the fine Gentleman! This is strange indeed, and I could hardly believe it at first Sight: But the more I read of his <hi>Amendments,</hi> &amp;c. the better I am as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd of the Sincerity of his Confession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laetitia</hi> has another lewd and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Sentence given her,<note place="margin">O. Batch. p. 39.

To this Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> answers, <hi>'Tis the expression of a wanton and vicious Character, and that she is discover'd in her Lewdness.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amend. p. 41.</note> I reply in the first place, That my disproof of his second <hi>Postulate,</hi> or Proposition, cuts off his retreat to this excuse.</p>
            <p>Secondly. She is not discover'd in her Lewdness, nor makes a dishonourable Exit; and Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> contradicts his own Play by affirming the contrary. For there's a Colour found out which passes upon the Credulity of <hi>Fondlewife,</hi> who declares himself satisfied with her Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.

               <hi>I have been a kind of Godfather to you yonder, I have promis'd and vow'd some things in your Name, which I think you are bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</hi> Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s answer is.<note place="margin">Old Batch. p. 49.</note> That <hi>he meant no ill by this Allegory, nor perceives any in't now.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amend. p. 42.</note> No <hi>ill in</hi>'t, that's Strange! Not in applying the solemn Engagements of Baptism to a ridiculous Subject, not in Burlesquing the <hi>Church Catechism?</hi> If these are no ill Things, there's no harm in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness; and then I confess he has justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied himself to purpose.</p>

1697. And yet here in this last Edition we have the exclamation <hi>Iesu,</hi> used in a jesting way,<note place="margin">Old Batch. p. 48.</note> by the fulsome <hi>Belinda.</hi> If Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> was displeas'd with the Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in his <hi>Double Dealer,</hi> why did he not expunge it in his <hi>Old Batchelour?</hi> He can't deny but that Opportunity presented fair a great while together. But here instead of asking Pardon of God and the World, and shewing himself concern'd for so scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous an Expression, He tells you a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Story (as he fancies) of a Letter of Advice from an <hi>Old Gentlewoman, and a Widow, who as she said, was very well to pass.</hi> I suppose she subscrib'd her self Old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman, as Widows generally do, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, as far as appears, he had been at a loss for her Age.

            <p>Sir <hi>Paul Plyant</hi> among the rest of his Follies, is mighty fond of the word <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> and repeats it on several occasions. From hence I drew this natural, or rather necessary Inference; That the meaning was to shew, that Sense and Religion agreed ill together, and that none but Fools were fit to talk piously. Mr. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greve</hi> instead of defending himself, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make me speak Nonsense, but that lies all in his own misquotation; as I have shewn already.</p>
            <p>He pretends there's no profane Allusion in his little Drollery about <hi>Iehu's being a Hackney Coachman</hi>; And seems confident no other <hi>Text</hi> can be burlesqu'd excepting <hi>Lady Froth's Poem.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Amend. p. 44, 45.</note> He says Lady <hi>Froth</hi> calls the <hi>Coachman our</hi> Jehu, <hi>and why might he not have that as well as any Iewish or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Name</hi>? I'le tell him for once. 'Twas never the Custom of Jews or Christians to take any <hi>Scripture</hi> Names from excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Persons. Neither <hi>Ieroboam</hi> nor <hi>Iehu,</hi> nor many others, were Religious enough for this purpose. No Man I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve ever heard of more than two <hi>Iehu</hi>'s, one in the <hi>Kings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 9.20.</note> and the other in the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54373:27"/>
               <hi>Double Dealer.</hi> That Prince in the <hi>Kings is said to drive his Chariot furiously.</hi> From hence the <hi>Coachman's</hi> Character was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quip'd. Both the Name and the Office, have a plain reference to the Holy Text. Farther, <hi>Lady Froth</hi> does not call her Coachman by any Name in her Poem; by consequence the Asterism for directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can never lead us to the meaning of her Verses. For if <hi>Iehu</hi> is unmention'd in the Poetick Text, how can the Lady be explain'd by his Standing in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin? In short, the worthy Mystery can't be clear'd up without recourse to the <hi>Scriptures</hi>; And therefore without doubt we are much obliged to the Poet for this necessity. Thus 'tis plain the Bible is made Bold with, and the Turn of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression seems to reach the <hi>Commentators</hi> too. However, if his meaning is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd on this later particular, it will do him very little Service; and I ask his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse. I'm sorry to spend so many words about such Stuff as this is; but Mr. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greve</hi> must have Justice done him.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Paul Plyant</hi> will afford us something worse than the former; This <hi>Wittoll</hi> of the Poet's making, tells his Lady he finds Passion <hi>coming upon him by Inspiration.</hi> This I had reason to Charge upon Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> as a very profane Expression:
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:54373:28"/>
In answer to this, He first Rails a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or two in his little way, and then very Magisterially tells us,<note place="margin">Amend. P. 45.</note> 
               <hi>That the word Inspiration, when it has Divine prefix'd to it, bears a particular and known significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But otherwise to inspire is no more than to Breath into; and a Trumpet, &amp;c. may be said without profaneness to deliver a Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Sound by the help of Inspiration.</hi> By his favour, All People that talk <hi>English</hi> know, that Inspiration, when it stands without Epithets and Addition, is always taken in a Religious signification. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, and to be Inspired, have a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and august meaning in Christianity. These words imply Divine Impulse, and supernatural Assistance, and are oppos'd to suggestion of Fancy, and humane Reasoning. To speak by Inspiration is to speak by the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as every Body can tell him: To be <hi>saved</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> signified at first no more than Safety, and Escape: But if a Man should say, <hi>As he hop'd to saved,</hi> and explain himself, that he intended no more, then that he hoped to get Cover before a Shower reach'd him; would he not be look'd upon as impertinently profane? If he call'd a lucky Leap of a Ditch <hi>Salvation,</hi> and pretended to justifie himself, that the word originally imports no more than Common
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:54373:28"/>
Deliverance, what Place would he be thought fit for? Thus when Words are made Inclosure, when they are restrain'd by Common Usage, and tyed up to a particular Sense: In this Case, to run up to Etymology, and Construe them by <hi>Dictionary</hi> and <hi>Praeposition,</hi> is wretchedly Ridiculous and Pedantick.<note place="margin">De Art.

For though <hi>Littlewit</hi>'s Allusion is profane, the words of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> are spared. He does not Droll directly upon <hi>Genesis,</hi> or St. <hi>Matthew</hi>; Upon God the Son, or God the Holy Ghost: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> has done that which amounts to both. And since he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to excuse himself upon the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Ben.

Liberties, at a time when we have reason to believe him most in earnest. Now Mr. <hi>Wood</hi> reports from the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a great Prelate then present. <q>That when <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi> was in his last Sickness,<note place="margin">Athen Oxoniens. Vol. 1. p. 519.</note> he was often heard to repent of his profaning the Scriptures in his Plays, and that with Horrour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now as far as I can perceive, the Smut and Profaneness of Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s Four Plays out-swell the Bulk of <hi>Ben. Iohnson</hi>'s Folio.

            <p>
               <hi>Love for Love</hi> comes at last upon the Board. In this <hi>Play</hi> I blamed him for making a <hi>Martyr</hi> of a Whoremaster: Upon this, he flies immediately for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to <hi>Scapula,</hi> and the <hi>Greek Grammar.</hi> He very learnedly tells us, that Martyr is a Greek <hi>word, and signifies in plain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish no more than a Witness.</hi> Right! these two words are the same; and when a
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54373:30"/>
Cause comes on in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> the <hi>Martyrs</hi> are call'd immediately! But <hi>Martyr</hi> is but bare <hi>Witness</hi> in the Greek. Not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways: Christian Writers often use it in a sense appropriated. And were it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, there's no arguing from one Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to another. <hi>Tyrant</hi> was once an Honourable Name in <hi>Greek,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a Reproach in <hi>English.</hi> But to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late upon these Cavils, is throwing away time. If the Reader desires more, he may please to look back on my Answer to his Objection about <hi>Inspiration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Poet's</hi> way of understanding <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> puts me in mind of a late Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which happen'd to a Country Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary. The Dr. had prescrib'd a Lady Physick to be taken in something Liquid, which the Bill according to Custom call'd a <hi>Vehicle.</hi> The Apothecary being at a Stand about the word, applies, as Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> might have done, to <hi>Littleton</hi>'s <hi>Dictionary.</hi> And there he finds <hi>Vehicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi> signified several considerable Things. He makes up the <hi>Bill,</hi> and away he goes to the Lady, where upon the Question, how the Physick was to be taken? He answers very innocently; Madam, says he, You may take it in a <hi>Cart,</hi> or a <hi>Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> but not to give your Ladyship too much trouble, I think a <hi>Wheelbarrow</hi> may
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54373:31"/>
do; for the word <hi>Vehicle</hi> in the Bill, will carry that sense. In short, This Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was comply'd with, and the <hi>Footman</hi> drove the <hi>Wheelbarrow</hi> about the Chamber. To return to Mr. <hi>Congreve.</hi> I had said that this Libertine Application of his, was dignifying Adultery with the Stile of Martyrdom;<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> As if (says Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>) <hi>any word could dignifie Vice.</hi> And pray why not? Does not the Varnish hide the Coarseness underneath, and the Pill go down the better for the Guilding? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he knows it or not, there's a great deal of Charm and Imposture in <hi>Words</hi>; and an ill practice is often comply'd with upon the Strength of a Fashionable Name.</p>

I'm almost sorry 'tis so low with him. When a Poet is so extreamly well inclin'd to be Witty, 'tis pity he has no more in his power. Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> goes on Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in his Defence and says,<note place="margin">Amend. p. 50.</note> 
               <hi>For the word Whoreson, I had it from</hi> Shakespear <hi>and</hi> Johnson. Not unlikely. People are apt to learn what they should not. Mr. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greve</hi>'s Memory, or his Invention, is very considerable this way. Indeed one would almost think by his Writings, that he had digested ill Language into a Common Place. But it was not only <hi>Whoreson,</hi> but <hi>Ieremy</hi>'s saying He was Born with <hi>Whoreson Appetites,</hi> which I complain'd of; and which I take to be Blaspheming the Creation.</p>
            <p>He pretends I have vvrong'd him strangely in a Rant of Sir <hi>Sampson</hi>'s: And would make the Reader believe I charge him literally with Paraphrasing the 139<hi>th</hi> Psalm.<note place="margin">Amend. p. 51.</note> I'm sorry I'm forced to explain my self in so clear a case.</p>
            <p>We may observe then, that the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist in Contemplation of the astonishing Beauty and Serviceableness of Humane Bodies, breaks out in a Rapture of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, <hi>I will give thanks unto thee,</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54373:32"/>
was indeed Ignorant that it belong'd to any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy else.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amend. p. 52.</note> To this I answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> yields <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wisdom ridiculed by <hi>this Observation,</hi> therefore by his own confession, if 'tis none of his Authors, he must Answer for't him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Now <hi>Pineda</hi> gives us a quite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent account of the Cause of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wisdom, and which is perfectly inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with <hi>Congreve's</hi> Banter. <q>
                     <hi>Pineda</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Wisdom was given him by God in a supernatural Dream,<note place="margin">1. Kings 3. 5, 12.</note> mentioned in Scripture. And that after the Dream,<note place="margin">Pined. Lib. 3. Cap. 8. P. 142, 147. Ed. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt.</note> he found an unsual Light in his Understanding; his Ideas were brighten'd, and the extent of his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge strangly enlarged. 'Tis true, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neda</hi> believed that <hi>Solomon</hi> understood <hi>Astronomy</hi> in Perfection,<note place="margin">Lib. 3. C. 18.</note> and that he had skill in <hi>Prognosticks</hi> which he calls <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomia judiciaria.</hi> He continues, that he could in a great measure reach the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Reasonings of Men,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> where they did not depend purely upon choice, and the turn of the <hi>Will.</hi> But then he does not say that <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Skill in <hi>Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticks</hi> was that which made him <hi>wise.</hi> No: This Tallent was only a Branch, but not the Cause of his Wisdom. For as <hi>Pineda</hi> speaks elsewhere,<note place="margin">Lib. 3 C. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> had a Universal Knowledge of Nature, but
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54373:33"/>
then this Excellency was no result of Natural parts, or Humane Industry; 'Twas an immediate Bounty from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; And both the Thing, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, were extraordinary.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> agrees with <hi>Pineda</hi> at least in a jesting way, <hi>Solomon</hi> was <hi>wise, but how? By his Iudgment in Astrology.</hi> That is, his distinguishing Attainments were gained this way. There was nothing in the case, but that he had looked into a Star somewhat farther than other people: He Learned his Wisdom it seems from the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> or <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> or from some such Book as <hi>Lillies Almanack.</hi> This is <hi>Scandal</hi>'s Solution of the Mystery; and the best that I can make on it. For t'is one thing to say that a Man is <hi>wise</hi> by <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> and another that <hi>Astrology</hi> or <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> was only a part of his Wisdom. The one Implies the Cause, and the other but a Branch of the Effect. The one excludes the Miracle, and the other affirms it. Upon the whole matter, Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> and <hi>Pineda,</hi> are not to be reconciled, so that by his own confession he has <hi>ridiculed the Wisdom of Solomon,</hi> and falsifyed his Author into the Bargain.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> Supposing <hi>Pineda</hi> had been fairly reported by Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> the <hi>Poet</hi> had been much to blame; For then the Case
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54373:33"/>
had stood thus; <hi>Pineda</hi> as Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> observes had ridiculed <hi>Solomon,</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had done no less, by Citing him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Censure, and upon a Drolling Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For this reason I waved the consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Pineda,</hi> as well knowing that should the Testimony have been right, the <hi>Play</hi> was certainly in the wrong. Besides, 'tis somewhat to be suspected Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> never saw <hi>Pineda</hi>; My reason is, because he falls twice into the same Mistake, he Quotes the <hi>Eighteenth</hi> Chapter for the <hi>Eighth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lov. for L. P. 44. Amend. p. 52.</note> and to make it appear the more gross, 'tis done in words of Length, and not in Figures. I hope for the future Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> wont bring in <hi>Solomon</hi> to divert the <hi>Play-House,</hi> nor compare him with Fools and Fortunetellers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scandal</hi>'s telling <hi>Foresight</hi> he was <hi>more than meer Man,</hi> and secure from Mistake upon that Score, is likewise a profane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression. To affirm this of any person, is as much as to say, he is either our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> or a <hi>Prophet,</hi> or under some Miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Influence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scandal</hi> goes on with <hi>Foresight,</hi> 
                  <q>and sayes the Wise Men of the East ow'd their Instruction to a Star,<note place="margin">Lov for L. P 44.</note> which is rightly observed by <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great in favour of <hi>Astrology.</hi>

                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:54373:34"/>Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> vindicates this passage by saying, that <hi>Scandal Banters Foresight,</hi> but <hi>not the Audience.</hi> Not Banter the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience! He Affronts the Audience I'm sure, if they have any Christianity in them, by drolling upon a Miracle at our Saviour's Birth: He banters St. <hi>Matthew</hi> too, who has recorded the Miracle, and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, who discourses upon it.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> is pleased to say that <hi>I am very angry that Sir Sampson has not another Name,</hi>

Love for Love, p. 74. Ed. 3<hi>d.</hi>
                  </note> But this I say, that Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> has burlesqu'd the History of <hi>Sampson,</hi> and wrested the <hi>Scripture</hi> into Smut.</p>
               <p>There are two other profane Passages Censur'd by me in the same Page: These he leaves as it were to shift for themselves, and has not as yet, made them worse by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending them: Excepting that he comes up with his old Cavil about the Word <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> which I have answer'd already.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> pretends that a Reflection on a <hi>Lord's Chaplain</hi> is no Reflection on a

Parson of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> That's somewhat strange. The <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Lords have no <hi>Chaplains</hi>; the Law does not allow it. And as for the Dissenters, there are very few Lords of their Perswasion. I desire therefore to know upon what Party the Abuse must stick? In earnest, I'm almost tired with answering these things. To strike the Air, does but make a Man's Arm ake.</p>
               <p>There is a pretty long Instance produced from the <hi>Double Dealer,</hi> to shew the Misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of the <hi>Stage</hi> towards the Clergy; these Passages he leaves to take their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; for they have nothing in them it seems,<note place="margin">p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 59.</note> which <hi>needs a Defence.</hi> This is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet way of answering; and I think, if he had made more use on't, it might have done as well.</p>
               <p>To shew the Unreasonableness of the Stage in representing the Clergy under Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Disadvantage and Contempt, I endeavour'd to vindicate the Reputation of that <hi>Order</hi> from three Topicks.

                  <hi>This Position,</hi> he says, is <hi>sophistical</hi>; and yet he is so Civil as to grant it in the next Line but one.<note place="margin">Amend. P. 61.</note> However, he makes a Stand at the Inference,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and asserts, That <hi>though the Credit of the Service rises in proportion to the Quality of the Master, yet the Credit of the Servant, does not rise in proportion to the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of the Service.</hi> Not rise in proportion to the Credit of the Service; that's strange! I thought Office and Authority had been a just ground for Regard; and that Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Charges had made Honourable Men. And if so, I suppose the Esteem of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son must improve with the Credit of the Employment. I would gladly know in what Circumstance the Dignity of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador consists? Does it not lye in his Commission and Credentials, in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and Significancy of his Character? What makes such a Person treated with greater Regard, than a <hi>Factor,</hi> or private <hi>Agent?</hi> Is it not the Honour of the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, and the Weight of the Business? Now he that executes for another, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents him by way of Authority, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt in his Service: From whence it follows, That if the Credit of the <hi>Servant</hi> rises by the Quality of the Business, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it must by consequence rise in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the Credit of the Service; for these are only different words to signify the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:54373:37"/>
same thing:<note place="margin">Amend. p. 61.</note> Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s saying, That <hi>an ill Servant both discredits his Service, and is discredited by it</hi>; is partly foreign, and partly false. To say he is discredited by it, is untrue. For 'tis the Misbehaviour, not the Office, which gives the Discredit. And then to say that an <hi>ill Servant discredits his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> is nothing to his point. For the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Suppose the Ministers of <hi>State</hi> or <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,</hi> in any Government, should fail in their Conduct: Are they presently to be insulted by the Common People, exposed in the Badges of their Character, and made the Diversion of the Town? What if a Man is an ill Servant, his Commission ought to be his protection from private Indignities. As for his Mismanaging, he must account to his Master; Equals or Inferiours, have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do to punish.<note place="margin">Amend. p. 62.</note> Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> adds, that <hi>if a Servant is punish'd by the Law, the Honour of the Service is not by that means violated.</hi> As much Law as he pleases; Let Justice have its Course, and I'm contented. But what's this to the Stage? Have they a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of Jurisdiction over the Clergy? Are they authorised to pronounce upon their Faults, and their Punishment? To give them little Behaviour, and contemptuous Usage; To make them Fools, and then treat them as such?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:54373:37"/>But now 'tis Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s turn to ask Questions:<note place="margin">Amend. p. 63.</note> He would know of me, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Man after he has received Holy Orders, is become incapable of either playing the Knave or the Fool?</hi> Why truly, considering he has the same Humane Nature with a Poet, I can't think him utterly incapable of either. And now I may have answer'd his question as civilly as he ask'd it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if a Clergy-man plays the Fool,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>he is equally with a Lay-Fool, the subject of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Contempt.</hi> Not in the same way nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Circumstances alter any Case. Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Things require different Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. There are Laws, Discipline, and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries,</hi> to take care of greater Miscarriages in the Church. And as for lesser Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, they should rather be lamented, than expos'd. The Clergy are a sort of Spiritual Parents. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s reasoning supposes it: And the Church Catechism gives them an inference of Privilege from the Fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. To banter a Relation of this kind, has neither Decency, nor Religion in't. And we know <hi>Ham</hi> got no Blessing by his Discovery. To stigmatize a solemn Character, to play the Buffoon in a Gown and Cassock, and shew the Church for a <hi>Monster,</hi> is, one would think, an odd diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in Christendom. The Heathens treated the Primitive Christians much at this rate:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:54373:38"/>
They wrapt them in Bear-skins, and then set the Dogs on them.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> urges, That by impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Behaviour the Man becomes alienated from the Priest,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>and so the Folly is exposed, not the Function.</hi> For example, if the Man be knock'd on the Head, the Priest is not a jot the worse for't. This is much like the old Distinction of <hi>Politick,</hi> and <hi>Personal Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,</hi> applied to another Case. To give this Gentleman an Answer more at large, he may please to take notice:</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> Though the Function and the Person are separable in Notion, they are joyn'd in Life and Business. 'Tis true, the Office and the Person are two Things; but yet 'tis the Person which executes the Office: This makes them share a disadvantage in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and a Censure frequently slides from the one to the other. If you make the Man a Knave, the Priest must suffer under the Imputation: And a Fool in his <hi>Person,</hi> will never be thought discreet in his Function. Upon this account Persons in Authority, whether Spiritual or Civil, ought to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileg'd from Abuse. To make the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> the <hi>subject of Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Contempt,</hi> disables their Authority, and renders their Commission insignificant. The Heathen Dramatists seem sensible of this reasoning,<note place="margin">See View, p. 122.</note> and practice accordingly.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:54373:38"/>2<hi>ly.</hi> If the Poets design was no more than to <hi>expose and reprehend Folly and Vice in general,</hi> why are not the Failings of the Clergy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in a Lay-Appearance? Why must the Satyr be pointed at the <hi>Coat,</hi> and run out into Reference and Distinction? Why must the Profession be dressed up, and the Folly keep all within the Function? Is not this plainly to confound the Order and the Miscarriage, to go off from the <hi>Man</hi> to the <hi>Priest,</hi> and render them both ridiculous?</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> Employments are oftentimes a shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Persons; and Characters a Protection from Insult: Publick Reason will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Authority to be expos'd, or the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates to be made a <hi>May-Game.</hi> To talk in Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s Language, a <hi>Lay-Fool</hi> is not always to be saluted by his Folly. This would be great rudeness in Conversation; and the Government might suffer by it. Condition is a Cover for Failings. And Authority must not be a Jest. In this case a Man should be view'd on the side of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and treated by his best Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Now if we consider the Author, and the Ends of Church Authority, we shall find it deserves a Guard, no less than that of the <hi>State.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Church-Article quoted by Mr. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greve,</hi> does him no Service. If it has any reference to the matter in hand, it makes
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:54373:39"/>
against him. The Article affirms, That <hi>Evil Ministers Act by Christ's Authority and Commission</hi>; That the <hi>Word and Sacraments are significant and effectual in their Hands</hi>; and that the Indisposition of the <hi>Agent,</hi> does not weaken the <hi>Institution.</hi> Now since even a vicious Priest represents our Saviour, since he is God's Ambassadour, and is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of the Blessings of Heaven: These Credentials, these Benefits, one would think, might guard him from Contempt, and make his Character inviolable. 'Tis true, the Article says, They <hi>may be accus'd, and being found guilty, by just Iudgment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.</hi> But what of all this? Are the <hi>Poets</hi> their Judges? And is the Stage grown <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Commons,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amend. p. 67.</note> or <hi>Westminster-Hall?</hi> Well: But the Article supposes a <hi>Distinction between the Man, and the Priest.</hi> Yes: And it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses too, that the Man ought to fare the better for this double Capacity.<note place="margin">Amend. p. 64.</note> Mr. <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greve</hi> in citing this Quotation, has mistaken the Chronology, and confounded the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> and <hi>Canons,</hi> but this I shall pass over.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> falls into a worse Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake than the former. He makes St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> affirm that the Validity of the <hi>Sacraments</hi> depends on the Probity of the Priest, and that the Article was partly <hi>established to take off the Authority of this Father.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ib. p 66.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:54373:39"/>Now to say this, is to misreport St. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> 'Tis true, this worthy Prelate believed that a Priests Authority was suspended by <hi>Heresy</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi>; but that bare Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could recall his Commission, he does no where suppose. The Case of <hi>Basilides</hi> and <hi>Martialis,</hi> if Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> had produced it, would not come up to the Point: For this Instance concerns Sacrificing to Idols; which is an Act of Apostacy: It implies a renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Christianity. From whence it will follow, that those who are not so much as Members of the Church, cannot have the Power of Church-Governours.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> seems displeas'd with that little Justice I endeavoured to do the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy; And calls the Testimonies of the best <hi>Poets,</hi>

                  <hi>Orators, Historians,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Vain Stuff.

                  <hi>Did Mr.</hi> Collier <hi>ever meet with any body Fool enough to engage him to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert that?</hi> Many a one, I can assure you, that have been either Fool or Knave enough, I can't tell which.

them.<note place="margin">See View, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ch. 3.</note> The <hi>Heathen Poets,</hi> as I prov'd at large, never serv'd their Priests so.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> urges, that <hi>Kings have been in all Ages Exposed and Punish'd on the Stage,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amend. p. 71.72.</note> 
                  <hi>yet never any King complained of the</hi> Theater <hi>or the</hi> Poets. From hence he argues, that if <hi>Kings may be exposed on the Stage</hi>; Why not Priests? To this I answer,</p>
               <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi>'s Argument supposes that <hi>Poets</hi> have the leave of <hi>Princes</hi> for this Freedom. Kings it seems are willing to be brought, and Disciplined on the Stage. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well. But does the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> desire to be represented? Does the Church give the <hi>Play-House</hi> this Permission? By no means. She Complains of the Practice, and would have it otherwise. Now what Consequence is there from Permission to Remonstrance, and from Pleasure to Aversion? The Church does not desire to be so Publick. Why should she be hal'd in, against her Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and gaz'd on like a Malefactor?</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> Stage Princes are used agreeably to their Station: The Honour of their Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shines out in their Appearance. Their very Misfortunes are Majestick, and their Ruin Glorious. They are never represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Insignificant, treated with Contempt, and Play'd the Fool with in <hi>Comedy.</hi> If they were thus used, I question not but that the <hi>Poets</hi> and <hi>Players</hi> would quickly hear on't.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:54373:40"/>3<hi>ly.</hi> If Princes were used as Ill as Priests upon the Stage, they would not suffer so much by it. Princes are well guarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Dramatick Out-rage. They have Power to Punish and to oblige. The Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of their Courts, the Pomp and Parade of their Figure, brighten their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and preserve a Regard. These Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances glitter upon the sense, and strike an awe upon the Spirits of the People. They refresh their Character, and make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. They prevent the spreading of Fiction into Life, and keep a <hi>Play-House-Abuse</hi> from being Acted in the Streets. In fine; Wealth and Power tho much short of Princes, breaks the force of Insolence, and is a Sovereign Remedy against Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. But the Clergy have no great share of these Advantages; I mean generally speaking, and with Us especially. Their Provision is often slender, their Censures relate to another World, and they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Lustre to affect the Imagination. A Condition thus unfortified, thus unorna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, lies open to Ill usage. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the Clergy are not so well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to disprove an unfair Representation. They can't so easily confute a Calumny by their Equipage, nor make their Fortune put a Lye out of Countenance. To be taken notice of, Things must shine as well as be
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54373:41"/>
solid; a Coarse out-side keeps the Richness within from being regarded. Spiritual Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, and invisible Advantage signifie lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with Ignorance, or Atheism. When a Man can scarce hold his Head above Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there needs no great Weight to sink him. Misfortune in such an Age as this, is almost a Jest of it self. A little Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fooning is sufficient to make Indigence look ridiculous; for when a Man's Coat is thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare, 'tis an easy matter to pick a hole in't.</p>

For this reason, the Apostle, speaking to private Christians, Enjoyns them in these words, <hi>Obey them that have the Rule over you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note>

for a Distinction. For I suppose a Man may be Lewd in his Practice, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Little in his Figure and Behaviour.

wise Man, but he was a Pagan, and lived too early to know any thing of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In short, either the <hi>Theatral Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances</hi> of the <hi>Cynethians</hi> were innocent, or they were not.

That the old</hi> Roman <hi>Virtue would be lost, and the Spirits of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple emasculated.</hi> This Harangue govern'd the <hi>Senate,</hi> and stopt the Progress of the <hi>Stage</hi> for that time. This Testimony St. <hi>Augustin</hi> mentions vvith Approbation. And in the next Chapter but one,<note place="margin">cap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 33.</note> He calls these <hi>Theatral Performances, animorum labem &amp; pestem,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54373:46"/>
probitatis &amp; honestatis eversionem,</hi> i. e. <hi>The Blemishes of Humane Nature, the Plague of Reason, and the Ruine of Virtue:</hi> And adds, <hi>That</hi> Scipio <hi>foreseeing these mortal consequences, hindred the building of</hi> Play-Houses. <hi>He did not think the Government could subsist upon the strength of Brick and Stone.

                  <hi>Being pensive at Home, if you go to the Theaters to drive away Fancies, it is as good Physick, as for the Ache of your Head, to knock out your Brains; or when you are Stung with a Wasp, to rub the Sore with a Nettle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The same Author is so Frank as to declare, That <hi>Ease and Idleness bring Destruction</hi>; and that <hi>Pleasure and Sport are the Devil's Baits:</hi> That <hi>honest Recreation quickens the Spirits, but Plays are venemous Arrows to the Mind.

                  <hi>Zara</hi> has another Flight very remarkable, and with that I shall conclude.

Now coming to the Prison she spies a Body without a Head, and imagining it <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min's,</hi> grows distracted upon't. And why
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:54373:50"/>
so? Was it because she was prevented, and had not the satisfaction of dispatching her Spark her self? Or was it because she had a mind to convince <hi>Osmin</hi> of the strength of her Affection by murthering him? That's somewhat odd. Was it then to shew how willing she was to dye with him? She says so; but presently rejects this reason as frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and unnecessary. For if you'll believe her, <hi>Osmin</hi> was capable of knowing her Passion, without so barbarous an Expedient.

By the way, I am sorry to find him thus Undistinguishing. This Ignorance in a <hi>Stage-Poet</hi> does not look well.

The Credit of Affectation is strangely trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, who would not take pains to be counted a Hypocrite?

In short, as things stand, Government of all kinds, requires somewhat of Figure. Appearance goes a great way in the Expediting of Affairs. Naked Reason won't always do.

For 1<hi>st.</hi> If Piety and Power are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd, and a Man must either throw up his Fortune or his <hi>Creed,</hi> the Laity will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to the same Resignation. The Inclosures of Property and Privilege must be broken down, and all Things laid in Common. But if 'tis possible for a Man to be Pious with a Penny in his Pocket, the Clergy I suppose may be so, with as little difficulty as their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Then as for <hi>Learning,</hi> Poverty, and this Advantage are inconsistent. As the World goes, there's little Knowledge to be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Money. A Man may get Honesty for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; but if he will have any Sense to't more than ordinary, he must pay for't. There are some few Exceptions to this Rule, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally speaking, it holds true. To go on. <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> is much better exercised with <hi>Revenue,</hi> than without it. 'Tis true, a Beggar may have as large a Soul as a Prince. But Will without Power, is neither so clear nor so serviceable. He that can go no farther than a good Wish, is oftentimes only kind in his Conscience, and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:54373:63"/>
a Benefactor to himself. For where the Heart is invisible, the Obligation must be so too. But Power brings secret Goodness into Light, and makes it appear unquestionable. And to come closer to the subject, I believe if the <hi>Preacher</hi> could Dine all the Poor of the <hi>Parish</hi> every <hi>Sunday,</hi> his Sermon would be more sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant. His Table would assist his Pulpit, and his Charity reinforce his Reasoning. They'd first come to him for the <hi>Loaves,</hi> and then for the <hi>Doctrine.</hi> And lastly, as for <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> I agree with the <hi>Vindicator</hi>; I think it most necessary; and that no Man can be a Christian without it. But whether I have the same Notion of this Virtue with our Author or not, I can't tell. To be humble, a Man is bound not to be full of himself, or grow stiff upon any Advantage, but give all the Glory to God. He must be fair in Conversation, not despise the least Mortal, but rather stoop to oblige those upon lower Ground. Thus far without doubt all Clergymen, and all Christians are concern'd to be Humble. But to be servile and sheepish to humour Pride, and blow up Conceit, this is quite another thing. There's neither Humility, Discretion, nor so much as Honesty, in such Management. 'Tis little Knavery, and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitical Meanness; and Church Men, of all People, should stand clear of so uncreditable an Imputation.<note place="margin">Congr.

The <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> and Mr. <hi>Congreve,</hi> are wonderfully for an humble Clergy: And so are some of the proudest Men I ever met with. If 'tis said the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54373:64"/>
Clergy are bound to be <hi>Exemplary,</hi> I willingly grant it. But Example supposes other Persons concern'd besides those who Set it. If the <hi>Clergy</hi> are to be Examples, 'tis because the <hi>

               </hi> without question are under the same Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Argument might be press'd far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but I rather chuse to leave it with the <hi>Reader.</hi> And since we are on the subject of Humility, the <hi>Vindicator</hi> and Mr. <hi>Congreve</hi> would do well to think on't. If as this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman observes, <hi>He who teaches Piety and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality to the World, is a great Benefactor to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:</hi> Then by the rule of Contraries, he who teaches Immorality, must be as great a Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance. He who makes it his business to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Vertue, and Conscience, and debauch both Practice and Principle, must needs be a Misfortune to the Age. Unless they can clear themselves of this Imputation, they ought to be wonderfully modest and unpretending. To be the Author of irreparable Mischief<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to destroy the Innocence of Life, the Securities of Government, and the Expectations of the World to come, are powerful Reasons for Humility. Those who in any measure lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Charge, can hardly bend too low, or think themselves lesser than really they are.</p>

                  <note place="margin">P. 78.</note> 'Twas a seasonable Thought, and I heartily wish it its due improvement; Such a Consequence wou'd be of great service, both to himself and the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.

               <p>I have nothing farther with the <hi>Vindicator</hi>; but before I Conclude, I shall speak to one Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection proposed by the <hi>Defender of Dramatick Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dennis.</hi> These Authors endeavour to justifie the <hi>Theater</hi> from the Silence of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> 
                  <q>The Word of God (say they) has no where condemned <hi>Plays,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Defence of <hi>Dramat. Poetry</hi> P. 40, 43, 55, 56. The Use<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fulness of the Stage, P. 138, 139. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> the <hi>Apostles</hi> who were particular in other Cases, have given the <hi>Stage</hi> no Reprimand, nor Christians any warning against it: And which is more, St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes no Difficulty in citing <hi>Menan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> a Comick <hi>Poet,</hi> which he would not have done unless he had approved both the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and his business too.</q>
This is the sum of what they offer. Now the Plea of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s citing <hi>Menander,</hi> is extreamly slender. Every foreign Sentence in <hi>Scripture</hi> is not commended by the bare mention. The Devil's Maxim of <hi>Skin for Skin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 2.4.</note> &amp;c. is set down, but not for our Imitation. I grant this Verse of <hi>Menander</hi> is Moral, and Sententious; And without doubt
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54373:69"/>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> cited it to put the Christians upon their Guard, and that they might be asham'd to fall short of the Instructions of the <hi>Heathens.</hi> But to infer that St. <hi>Paul</hi> approved all that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander</hi> had written, and that the <hi>Apostle</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended <hi>Plays</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all this from one single Line of Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is Prodigious consequence. This Latitude would justifie the <hi>Stage</hi> to purpose, and make the Lewdest Authors pass Muster. There being few Books so entirely Vitious as not to afford an inoffensive and significant period. I don't speak this with application to <hi>Menander,</hi> for as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch</hi> observes, he was with respect to <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanes,</hi> a very Modest <hi>Poet.</hi> Besides this very quotation <hi>that evil communication corrupts good Manners,</hi> disserves the purpose 'twas brought for. 'Tis a sharp Rebuke of the Licentiousness of our <hi>Stage,</hi> and a plain Discountenance of so scandalous a Diversion.</p>
               <p>To proceed with the Objection. I affirm that <hi>Plays</hi> are plainly condemned in <hi>Scripture</hi> upon two accounts. I say they are clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, tho not by express Prohibition; yet by Principle and Consequence, which is the same thing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They are condemned upon the score of <hi>Idolatry</hi>; They were parts of <hi>Pagan</hi> Worship, and under that notion unlawful to Christians. But this Reason expiring in a great measure with the <hi>Heathen</hi> Religion, I shall insist on it no farther. However it proves thus much, that the Unlawfulness of every Liberty is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Mark'd in <hi>Scripture.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 140, 142.</note> For in the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> time, Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> allows <hi>Plays</hi> were Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous

and unlawful; and yet we see the Holy <hi>Text</hi> does not declare against the <hi>Theater</hi> by Name.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Stage,</hi> (particularly the <hi>English</hi> one) is condemned in <hi>Scripture</hi> upon the score of Smut and Profaneness; upon the Account of the <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> and Indecency of such Liberties.<note place="margin">St. Mat. 5.

To pass the time of our sojourning here in fear, and abstain from all appearance of Evil.</hi> And in a word, <hi>To have no pleasure in</hi> Scandalous Practices, <hi>no fellowship with the unfruitful works of Darkness, but rather reprove them.</hi> Here's Evidence enough in all reason, these Admonitions are full against our <hi>Stage.</hi> Not one <hi>Play</hi> in forty can stand the <hi>Test</hi> of so much as one single <hi>Text.</hi> Bring the <hi>Theater</hi> but to the <hi>Bible,</hi>

                  <hi>This Citation is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely false.</hi> Right! 'Tis false in the <hi>Latin,</hi> but 'tis true in the <hi>Greek.</hi>

               <p>Besides, the <hi>Latin</hi> makes more against him. For by that the Law says,<note place="margin">Dennis, p. 86.</note> 
                  <hi>That no Man whatsoever should write any Comedys</hi>; which is a higher Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure than the other. I hope, for the future Mr. <hi>Dennis</hi> won't confide so much in a Translation; especially when it sits harder than the <hi>Original.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Remark from <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s Treatise of <hi>Poetry</hi> is another Mistake; and I think not at all to his Advantage: But to set him in his way, this Philosopher does not say that <hi>Comedy was very much discourag'd at first,</hi> nor very little neither. This point was not argued:<note place="margin">Arist. lib. de Poet. cap. 5.</note> He only affirms, <hi>That it was a great while before the</hi> Chorus <hi>was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd out by the Government.</hi>

               <p>This Gentleman appear'd early in the Cause, and has given me very little trouble, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'twould hardly be Civil not to dispatch him at the first Hearing.</p>

               <p>To this I Answer, First, That I only affirm'd the <hi>Stage</hi> was manifestly comprehended under <hi>Saecularia Spectacula:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">View, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 250.</note> And that it is so, will follow from his own Assertion. For if the <hi>Ludi Saecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares,</hi> and <hi>Saecularia Spectacula</hi> were the same, 'tis well known that <hi>Stage Plays</hi> were part of the <hi>Ludi Saeculares</hi>;<note place="margin">Rosin.

               <p>Secondly, The third Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> by me cited, can't possibly mean the <hi>Secular Plays</hi> by <hi>Saecularia Spectacula:</hi> For this Council was held <hi>anno</hi> 397. fourscore years and better after the Conversion of <hi>Constantine.</hi> Now these <hi>Ludi Sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culares</hi> were Idolatrous, both in the Practice and Institution, and never celebrated after the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire became Christian: The last time we hear of them was in the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Philip,</hi>
