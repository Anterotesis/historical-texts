         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yet leaſt opinion might deceive

the Raile about the Altar: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſtarting up, and againe vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
flinging himſelfe to the
ground, yelling, ſhriking, and
howling, as if the univerſall doom
of puniſhment for ſinne had been
laid on him onely. This and the
feare I was ſtrucken in, made mee
partaker of his unexpreſſible tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and to cry out, O Lord!
what is this? The Exorciſt a holy
Father, that was diligent about
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1672:10"/>
him, made anſwer, It was a man
poſſeſt with an evill ſpirit, and
had hardly ſpoke, but the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentour
tooke the word. The
Conjurer, ſaid hee, lyes; this is
not a Man poſſeſt by a Devill,
but a Devill poſſeſt by a Man.
Diſcourſers take heed what you
ſpeake, for in queſtions and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,
you rather bewray your
ignorance, than knowledge. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that wee Devils are not
(as I am now) in the Bodies of
<hi>Sergeants,</hi> but by conſtraint, and
againſt our wils; and therefore if
you will name mee as you ought,
you muſt ſay that I am a Devill
Sergeantiz'd, and not a <hi>Sergeant</hi>
Diaboliz'd: which you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
credit by this, becauſe all
men ſpeed better with us than
with them, ſince wee flie the
Croſſe, (fixt on the top of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1672:10"/>
Mace,) but they make uſe of it as
an inſtrument whereby to doe
miſchiefe. And though I muſt
confeſſe there is a great corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency
betweene their Offices
and ours, in that they procure
other mens hurt, as well as wee;
and as wee deſire there may bee
none but wicked and guilty men
in the World, ſo doe they alſo:
Yet theirs is with a moſt eager
greedineſſe, pricked forward
through an helliſh diſpoſition,
and an avaritious deſire of gaine;
but ours onely for company ſake.
And in this alſo they are more to
be blamed than we, becauſe their
evill turnes to the deſtruction of
their owne ſexe and kinde, which
wee abhorre. For wee are Angels
though deprived of Grace, and
had never beene converted into
Devils, had wee not ſtroven to bee
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1672:11"/>
equall with God. But <hi>Sergeants</hi>
turne <hi>Sergeants</hi> to be the vileſt of
men, and greatly delight in the
miſerable confuſion of others; ſo
that you all ſtrive in vaine to
preſent comfort to this Wretch,
ſince there is no man ſo godly,
that ſtayes not in his tallons if
he once can catch him, and they
and wee may well bee both of an
Order, were it not that they are
Devils cloathed and ſhod, but we
naked and bare-footed, (as you
are,) leading an hard life in Hell.</p>
               <p>Though we were all tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with wonder to heare theſe
Diabolicall ſpeeches, yet did
they not at all hinder the Frier
from continuing his Exorciſmes;
who hoping to ſtill the Spirit,
caſt holy Water on him: but
that was rather a motive to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
tattle. Thinke not, ſaid hee,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1672:11"/>
your bleſſing of Water can make
it available, I tell you it rather
hurts than benefits, there being
nothing that <hi>Sergeants</hi> hate
more than it. For men have ſo
often revenged themſelves in this
kinde, in heat flinging them into
Rivers, to coole their appetite:
in cold, into Privy bathes, to
warme their malice, that it is
growne abominable to them:
who cannot any way bee accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
good Chriſtians, becauſe
both their Office and Name is
derived from Moores and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
Nations that never made a
Conſcience of any thing.</p>
               <p>Wound not your ſelves by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe,
(ſaid the religious man to
the aſſembly) the Devill was ever
a lyar, and if wee ſuffer him, will
raile and murmur againſt Juſtice
her ſelfe; becauſe by correcting
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1672:12"/>
the world, and chaſtiſing vice, ſhe
ſnatches away many Soules from
him, which otherwiſe would
have been enſnared. Dotard (ſaid
the inmate) diſpute not with me,
for I know more than thou doſt;
but if thou wilt doe mee a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
indeed, baniſh mee this <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants</hi>
body: for I am a Devill of
quality, and when I returne to
Hell ſhall be ſoundly ſwaggerd at,
for haunting ſo bad a Companion.
Through the compaſſion I have of
thoſe bitter torments thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
him ſuffer, by Gods grace,
(ſaid the Divine) I will doe it,
and not for the fooliſh words
thou ſpeakeſt. Wherefore doſt
thou ſo much afflict him? Can I
doe leſſe? (anſwered he) when at
this very inſtant, his ſpirit is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
with mine, who ſhould
be the greater Devill, he or I.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:1672:12"/>
The Fraternity regarded not
his malicious anſwers, but I
whoſe feare, beganne to bee leſſe,
and inquiſitiveneſſe more, tooke
great delight to heare him prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
And turning to the reverend
man, deſired, that (if poſſible ſo
much licence might be given to a
ſtranger) he would partly hinder
the poore mans endurement, and
permit mee to demand ſome few
queſtions of the intruder; which
it might bee would not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
my ſelfe, but accrue to the
good of ſome of mine owne
Countrimen, if at any time I
ſhould make them familiar with
the paſſages. This was no ſooner
ſpoke, and condiſcended to, but
the Spirit forcing the Body to
looke upon mee, and laughing at
me, began. We have Kindred and
friends (ſaid hee) both in Court
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1672:13"/>
and City; when there are Poets,
they doe us many good offices,
by the Trade of Venery and
Macquerellage. And though their
wits can clothe their fancies in a
higher ſtraine than you doe, yet
you all, tending ro the ſame cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and embracing the ſame ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
are bound to give your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
to maintaine the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of thoſe of your Profeſſion,
whom wee ſuffer in Hell. Are
there any Poets in Hell, ſaid I? Yes
many, (replied hee,) the way is
ſo eaſie, and they doe ſo ſwarme,
that wee muſt bee faine to enlarge
their abode, and there is nothing
in the world ſo delightfull as
to ſee a Poet in the firſt year of his
freſhmanſhip there, who moſt
commonly brings letters of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
directed to our ſuperior Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
thinking to finde <hi>Charon,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1672:13"/>
Cerberus, Rhadamant, Eacus,</hi> and
<hi>Minos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what paines doe they ſuffer
(ſaid I, feeling my ſelfe galled?)
Many (replied hee) and thoſe
ſuch as are proper to the Trade.
Some are tormented in hearing
the workes of others rehearſed,
(the puniſhment alſo of Muſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans)
which they envy, yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
mend. There are ſome of a
thouſand yeares continuance in
Hell, and yet have not made an
end of reading the ſtanza's they
compoſed of incontinency.
Others that rubbe the palmes of
their hands, ſcratch their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
beate their browes, and
teare their haire, and yet cannot
reſolve whether is moſt proper,
diſaffected or unaffected, depain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
or unpainted, becauſe the
word comes from painting.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1672:14"/>
There are others, that ſeeking
out a conſonancy, as it were
blindfolded, walke raving to and
fro, biting their nailes and eating
their band-ſtrings, till they fall
into holes and pits, from whence
wee have a great deale of trouble
to plucke them out. But thoſe
that endure moſt, and are worſt
entreated are Comicke Poets,
juſtly puniſhed for making a rape
upon the honour of ſo many
Queenes, Princeſſes, and great
perſons in <hi>England,</hi> by their une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
matches of them; and in
their Playes for diſplaying ſo
many invectives againſt men of
eſteeme. With theſe of the land,
water Poets are not planted, but
becauſe they have uſed ſo many
inventions, fictions, and lyes, to
coozen the World, and get mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
are put among Proctours
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1672:14"/>
and Solicitours, as amongſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
that live by that exerciſe: for
you muſt underſtand, that as
there is great conveniency, ſo
there is very good order kept in
Hell. The other day there came
thronging to us of all ſorts; hee
that firſt enterd, was a conceited
fellow, a Drawer, one that by
deviſing patternes for waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coates,
&amp;c. got no ſmall favour;
whom when we thought to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with Projectours, wee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
that hee ſaid, beſides his
draught hee could counterfeit to
the life, therefore hee was ſetled
with Scriveners and Attournyes,
as among them that can draw
and counterfeit upon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Another called himſelfe a
Cutter; he was asked whether of
Stone or Marble? but ſaying hee
was of their kinde who cut off
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1672:15"/>
mens purſes, and at Maſques La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
ſhirts, wee put him with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractours
and evill ſpeakers, as
amongſt thoſe that rend the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of anothers good fame.
Blinde men that thought to
ſhrowd themſelves among Poets,
were thruſt among Lovers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the ſympathy. And
Vintners with Waterbearers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the mixture. Fooles were
chamberd up with Aſtrologers
and Alchymiſts. Murderers with
Phyſitians. Ill dealing Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
with <hi>Iudas.</hi> Evill Magiſtrates
and Miniſters with the bad
Thiefe. Citizens with Shufflers.
And Brokers with Jewes. And to
conclude, there is not any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
ſo well ordered as
Hell, where every one hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement
according to his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:1672:15"/>
I thinke you ſpoke of Lovers,
(ſaid I) and becauſe I am as well
ſenſible of that infirmity as of
Poetry, I would willingly know
if there bee many? Love being a
great ſpot of Oyle which ſpreads
all abroad, (added hee) thou
needeſt not doubt but Hell is
well throngd with the amorous.
There are of divers ſorts. Some
that are Lovers of themſelves,
others of their money, others of
their ſpeeches, others of their
workes, and ſome of their wives,
and of that kinde there are very
few, becauſe women are of ſuch
malignant natures, that by their
diſloyalty, imperfections, and
ſearching wits, they give every
day new ſubject to their Husbands
to repent of their conjunction
and alliance with them. All Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
are delightfull to ſee, and full
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1672:16"/>
of mirth, if there may bee ſaid
to bee any in Hell. Some you
would take for a Millaners ſhop,
they are ſo deckt with points,
knots, and ribbens, of all ſorts,
which they call favours. Others
for a periwigge makers ſtall, they
are ſo hung with bracelets, amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
and lockes of all haires and
all colours. You would take ſome
for Meſſengers to a great City,
laden with packets and Epiſtles
to and from their Miſtreſſes;
which they call Love-letters, but
we <hi>Inflamers,</hi> becauſe they ſerve
to inflame and burne the bearers.
And others for Jeſters, the poſture
of their wooing is ſo ridiculous,
who once loved, but never obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Theſe are condemned for
ſhort ſhooting, yet wonne the
game; and thoſe for kiſſes that
never betrayed. Under them, in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1672:16"/>
a dirty and ſtifling hole, carpeted
with beaſts hornes, were thoſe
that you call Cuckolds; Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that at the firſt beganne to
buſtle with us, objecting a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
injury, if they ſhould now
againe bee puniſht, that in the
world had already received diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
ſufficient: the Horne graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon their forehead, being
firſt taken from the Devils owne
brow, who in the ſhape of a man
made the firſt Cuckold. But when
wee told them that the Divell ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
wore Hornes, but that they
were derived from the Goat and
Ramme, emblems of mans libi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinouſneſſe,
and the name of
Cuckold from the Cuckoe, a bird
that having plundered the iſſue of
an innocent, maketh her hatch
her viperous brood, or elſe from
mens owne indulgence and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1672:17"/>
impudence; they became
the moſt peaceable of all our pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries,
and are armed with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
patience: for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
beene heeretofore ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and fortified in the unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
dealings of their wicked
wives, they are never angry at
any thing that is done unto them.
In which reſpect, and our owne
pity, wee have advanced them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
one of our faireſt upper lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings:
and in their Dungeon
have placed ſuch as are lovers of
age and old women, who are
ſtrongly chained; for Divels
themſelves doe not hold their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
ſafe, amongſt people whoſe
taſte is ſo depraved.</p>
               <p>But having ſatisfied your curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity,
I muſt tell you that wee Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
are much offended, in that
you mortals ſo ſlovenly beſmeare
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1672:17"/>
and disfigure us. Sometimes pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
us with clawes and tallons,
yet are wee neither. Eagles
nor Griffins. Then gluing tailes
to our poſteriours, as if wee
needed flie-flappes, or the world
ſhould miſtake us for Hernes. And
then parching on our chinnes,
wenny, and welky beards, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſe
us into Turky-cocks
and Cocks combs; yet there bee
Divels amongſt us that may well
bee taken for Scholars and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers.
But you had beſt
mend this, if you covet a good
fire when you come to viſit us.
Wee asked the other day that
Painter whom you call <hi>Michael
Angelo</hi> (though improperly)
why he preſented us in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with ſo many beaſts hooves,
deformed bodies, wry neckes,
and crabbed faces? His anſwer
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1672:18"/>
was, That having never ſeene any
of our Tribe, and not crediting
there were any, he had made that
piece after his owne fancy, and
not out of any ends of malice.
But ignorance did not excuſe his
ſinne, for hee now findes the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of that, hee would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
beleeve. We complaine alſo,
that in your familiar diſcourſe
one with another, you give us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary
preſents. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſayes
one) <hi>how this Divell Tailor hath
abuſed mee, How hee makes mee
wait, How he hath ſtolne from me;
Would hee were in Hell!</hi> You doe
us a great deale of wrong to wiſh
them there, or to make ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons;
For wee never ſuffer
them to come nigh us but with
a great deale of intreaty: becauſe
they doe already alleage the name
of inheritance, in that <hi>Cuſtome is
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1672:18"/>
a ſecond Law.</hi> And having taken
poſſeſſion of Theft, oftner kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Stuffes demanded of them,
than Sabbaths commanded; they
enter grumbling and muttering
when we doe not open the backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doore,
and thereby acknowledge
them legitimate Children. <hi>The
Divell take it and thee,</hi> ſayes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to him and thoſe things
that diſpleaſe him; keepe your
gifts at home, for of this kinde
there come more than wee fetch,
neither doe wee take all that are
given; for wee make a conſcience
of ſome things: and would not
accept of the forward Letcher
when he ſayes, <hi>I would I might be
damned to lie with ſuch a Beauty,</hi>
but that hee does enforce us. You
beſtow likewiſe on the Divell
every roguiſh Page and Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy;
but hee will have none of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1672:19"/>
them, for know (that for the moſt
part) they are more wicked than
Divels themſelves. Alſo you give
to the Divell an Italian, but the
Devill thankes you with all his
heart, yet loves not to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
An Engliſhman, but hee
will have none of their new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions.
A Spaniard, but hee that
knowes the tyranny they uſe in
making themſelves maſters of
Townes, when once they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
entrance; deteſts their
cruelty. And a Frenchman, but
the Divels ſtomacke will not ſerve
him, becauſe they are already
parboyld; and therefore intreats
you to ſend them to the Great

               <p>Here the Spirit became ſilent;
when hearing a noiſe behinde
mee, made by one who had crept
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1672:19"/>
in, and was thruſting to get fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
I turned about to ſee who
durſt bee ſo uncivill in a place ſo
ſacred. And perceived it to bee a
certaine Informer, that had been
the cauſe of the undoing of one
of my deare aſſociates. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that I might a little vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
my Friend, I againe queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the poſſeſſour. Seeing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men of divers conditions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit
your clime, Are there none
there of thoſe Horſe-leeches,
thoſe plagues to Kingdomes, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectours,
&amp;c? You are cunning,
(ſaid hee) Know you not that
theſe Vermin are the naturall
heires to damnation, and have
their patrimony aſſigned in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
darkeneſſe; yet know
alſo that wee are upon the point
to diſcard them, for they are
growne unthankfull, beginne to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1672:20"/>
ſcuffle with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
lay a Tribute upon the
wayes to Hell, but becauſe the
charge encreaſes dayly, and wee
beleeve that in proceſſe of time
the taxe will mount ſo high, that
our Agents on Earth will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to forſake their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
(a thing very prejudiciall
to our Common-wealth) wee
will from henceforth ſhut our
Gates and utterly exclude them.
In doing ſo you may be injurious,
(ſaid I) for then they will aime
at Heaven. Never feare that, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
hee) for that is a traffique
they never delighted in. But, I
pray you, on whom will they
raiſe theſe new impoſitions? If
you labour to know all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
(anſwered hee) bid
that fellow draw nigh that ſtands
there (pointing to my Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1672:20"/>
for hee is of the occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
At this the Company pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
caſt their eyes upon him,
whereat hee was ſo aſhamed, that
turning his backe, and plucking
his hat over his eyes, hee ſlunke
away, leaving the by-ſtanders
aſtoniſhed, and me revenged. And
when the tumult was appeaſed,
the Divell continuing ſaid, Is my
Champion abſent? I care not
greatly, if I ſupply his place.
Underſtand then, that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolies
they would now finde
out, and the Impoſts they would
impoſe and ſet forward are upon
jewels, rings, plate, and precious
ſtones, upon lace, handkerchers,
dreſſings, gorgets, and the nice
attire of women, upon coaches
that ſerve for no other purpoſe
but to hurry men to Tavernes,
Theaters, and the aſſignations of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1672:21"/>
love. Upon exceſſe of apparell,
feaſts, and ſtately moveables. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Play-houſes, the ſchooles of
blaſphemy and obſceneſſe. And
generally upon all other things
whatſoever, that ſerve to enhance
the pride of the world, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
our Empire; which will
become utterly deſolate, unleſſe
ſome good Magiſtrate, and our
Friend, oppoſe himſelfe againſt
them. Not ſo, (I perſiſted by way
of interruption) In this mee
thinkes they are very reaſonable,
ſeeing that the toleration of ſuch
things ſerve onely to pervert
good manners, corrupt chaſtity,
ſtirre up riot and prodigality,
and utterly ruinate modeſty and
vertue. But concerning Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
of whom thou beginneſt
to ſpeake, Can it bee poſſible that
there are any Judges in Hell? A
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1672:21"/>
fine queſtion (replied the Divell)
Friend, a wicked Judge is the
ſeed that fructifies moſt for us:
'tis a Graine from which we eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
yeare receive a thouſand Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours,
ten thouſand Proctours.
Advocates, and Lawyers; and
more than twenty thouſand Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals
and Pettifoggers; ſo that
many times when the yeares are
fruitfull in cheating and deceit,
wee have not Garners enough to
containe the fruit that comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us by the meanes of corrupt
Judges.</p>
               <p>Wilt thou then inferre that
there is no Juſtice upon Earth?
Yes, (ſaid hee) if the ſtory of
<hi>Aſtrea</hi> bee true, didſt thou ever
heare it? No, Hearken then, (ſaid
the Fiend) and I will tell it.
<hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> on a time came
together to inhabite the Earth,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1672:22"/>
but found none to entertaine
them; becauſe one (which was
<hi>Truth</hi>) was naked, and the other
ſevere. In the end after they had
wandered up and downe, like va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds
without ſhelter, <hi>Truth</hi>
was enforced to dwell with one
that was dumbe, and <hi>Juſtice</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſelfe unregarded, and that
her name was uſurped by Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants,
reſolved to returne: yet
that ſhee might leave no way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſayed,
ſhee retired from Courts,
Palaces, and Cities, and travelled
into the Countrey, where in Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
and Villages ſhee reſted a
while under the ſimplicity and
integrity of the poore inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants;
from whence <hi>Envy</hi> (that
never left to perſecute her) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
her alſo. Then went ſhe to
Gentlemens houſes; but being
never bred up to lie, when they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1672:22"/>
demanded who ſhee was, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<hi>I am Iuſtice;</hi> they drove her
from them too, ſaying, we know
not what that is. So that being ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
refuſed, ſhee fled or rather
flew up to Heaven, ſcarce leaving
behind ſo much as the trace of her
footſteps. Since when, men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring
her name, attribute that
kind of Scepter or Mace unto her,
which hath a croſſe at the top;
which although it have got the

<hi>Baſis,</hi> becauſe that many times
through the abuſe of it, it hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
better to ſteale, than the

of Theeves. For humane cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe
is growne to that height,
that all have converted the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of their mindes and ſenſes,
into inſtruments to commit theft.
The Lover, doth hee not ſteale a

Virgins honour, with her owne
conſent? The Lawyer, doth he not
ſteale his Clients goods, with his
knowledge, when hee perverts the

doth he not ſteal his Spectators
heart, when hearkning unto the

ſteale with his eyes? The Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

with his hands? The Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
with his voyce and fingers?
The Dancer, with his feet? The
Phyſician, with death? The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary,
with health and ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?
The Chirurgion, with

to all theſe, ſteales away
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1672:23"/>
both his Soule and body by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
relinquiſhment; for hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes
them with his eyes, flies
from them with his feet, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowes
them with his tongue.
And they are moſt of them ſo
wicked, that wee ſay of them, as

               <p>I wonder (ſaid I to the Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
that thou haſt not reckoned

Alas! Speake not of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

(ſaid hee) for wee are ſo peſtered,

that wee deſire not their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,

there were not ſo many in Hell,
that would bee none of the worſt

they doe nothing but invent
ſnares, labyrinths, ambuſcadoes,
and I doubt not but in time will
wage warre with us for ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

that is in them, is, that in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
they aske no toyes and

for they know wee deale not in
ſmall wares.</p>
               <p>Of what ſort have you moſt,
of beautifull or deformed? Wee

(ſaid hee) For though the faire

ſometimes happens, that by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance

us: for the moſt part of them
are all old, and die grunting like

               <p>All my demands are untwiſted,
but this; I pray you tell mee if
there bee any poore in Hell?
What doe you meane by poore
ſaid the Devill? I call him poore
that poſſeſſeth nothing. How
underſtandeſt thou that, ſaid he?
How? Wouldſt thou have him
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1672:25"/>
condemned that holds nothing
of the World, when none are
damned but ſuch as covet and
enjoy it? Thoſe men that thou
ſpeakeſt of, are not enrolled in
our bookes. And wonder not at
it, for all things are wanting to
them, yea the Divels themſelves.
You are rather Divels one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
another, than Divels are
Divels to you. For can there bee
a more notorious Divell than a
Flatterer? an envious man? a
falſe friend? a bad Companion?
an unmercifull Creditour? or a
ſonne, brother, or kinſman, that
wiſhes you dead to get your
wealth? that ſeemes to weepe
and bemoane you when you are
ſicke, and yet cares not if the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell

to the poore man, hee is not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd,

or alliance de irous of his diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
for any obſcure ends, but
hee is one that lives well, and dies
better. And there are ſome ſo
contented with this manner of
life, that they will not change
their condition with Kings; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they have liberty to goe
every where, whither they will,
in peace and warre, free from all
charges, impoſitions, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
ſervices, exempt from all
judgements, civill cenſures, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of Law, and juriſdiction,
and in their Conſciences are
wholly uncorrupted. Moreover,
they take no care for the morrow,
obſerving in that the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God. They husband
their time well, and can juſtly
value the dayes of their pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1672:26"/>
in ſetting before their eyes
that death holds in his power all
that is paſt, governes all that is
preſent, and pretends a right to
all that is to come. But there is a
proverbe, that <hi>When the Devill
preaches, the World drawes to an
end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wee may truly ſay that Gods
hand is in this, ſaid the religious
Conjurer. Thou art the Father of
lyes, yet declareſt truths, able to

The greateſt part of teares you

to forſake the world, and not out
of any repentance for your ſinnes.
And though ſin be ſometimes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing

thou ſeekeſt to delude us, and it
may be it is not the will of God,
that thou ſhouldeſt bee expelled

            <p>Dizzied with theſe Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

it was rather cauſed by ſome ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall

from outward moleſtations, and
buſied in beholding this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Comedy, to which my fancy
ſerv'd as a Stage for unuſuall
Actours.</p>
            <p>I ſaw divers Phyſitians enter,
riding on large foot-clothes,
ominous in this, that they reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Hearſes for the dead. Their
traine was broken and diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
for ſome went a foot-pace,
and others on the ſpurre. Their
faces were contracted, got more
by cuſtome than age, in often
frowning on their Patients urine,
which prognoſticated to the
Sicke, more terrour than redreſſe.
And theſe were followed by
young Practitients, who by their
frequent converſation with the
Horſes, more than with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1672:29"/>
became eaſily graduated.</p>
            <p>Apothecaries came next, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with morters, peſtles, and
doſes, whoſe out-ſide bore the
aſcribed cures, and inſide poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
Their Shops were the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
Storehouſe, and the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteds
Purgatory. Their Recipes
began with receive, but included
to take, an ounce for themſelves,
and a ſcruple for the dying man.
And all their compoſitions were
diſguiſed with ſuch ſtrange no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
as if they had beene
Sorcery: curſed inquiſitours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

            <p>Chirurgions with ſome unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe

conceited precedency; the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology
of their name ſignifying,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1672:30"/>
a Phyſitian that worketh by

with pincers, cauters, files, ſawes,
knives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and lancets; and their
cries of, cut, teare, diſmember,
burne, infuſed ſuch feare, that my
bones were conſulting how they
might ſerve as ſheathes to hide

            <p>Then Mountebankes (whoſe
papers ſpeake better than they)
who with more impudence and
leſſe skill, would cure all Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
with one Antidote, upon
which there was no great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute.
Nor of the Barbers Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
(who came next) becauſe
it either killes or heales. Theſe
were more finicall than their
forerunners, yet at proudeſt are
but ſhavers of Excrements. Their
greateſt Artillery were Cizzers,
Razers, and baſons, and ſome
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1672:30"/>
ſharpe lotions, the which were
allayed, by the delicious mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke

            <p>Seeing them followed by men

Tooth-drawers; mouth-deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and drawers on of old age:
not ſhaming to wiſh all mens
teeth upon their thread, rather
than in the place of their birth.</p>
            <p>After theſe came men of divers

all great talkers. Some were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Swimmers, by reaſon that in
ſpeaking they ſpread their armes
to and fro, as if they were ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.
Others imitatours, in that
they counterfeited the lookes and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1672:31"/>
geſtures of thoſe they ſpoke of.
And others ſowers of diſſention,
becauſe they moved their eyes
this way and that way (not ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the head) to marke by
ſtealth the actions of thoſe they
meant to betray.</p>
            <p>And laſt of all Diſſemblers, a

having got the ſecrets of men,
convert them to the Relaters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice,
and their owne mercena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
profit. Theſe were called the
extract of all the importunate,
and becauſe the poyſon of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
lies in the taile, came in the
reere as moſt poyſonous.</p>
            <p>Upon this, I beganne to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
to what uſe, this great troope
and confuſion might tend: when
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1672:31"/>
behold a certaine Apparition
drew neare, that ſeemed to bee
of the Feminine kinde, of light
gate and looſe proportion. Shee
was laden with crownes, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,
ſcepters, ſikles, ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hookes,
buskins, wooden ſhooes,
tires, miters, bonnets, embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
ſilke, skinnes, wooll<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> gold,
lead, diamonds, ſhels, pearle, and
flint. One of her eyes was ſhut,
and the other open. She was cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
in all colours, on one ſide
appearing young, and on the
other old. Now going apace, and
anon ſlowly, at one time ſeeming
afarre off, and by and by at hand
And at all times ſo inconſtant,
that I could not have leaſure to
fancy who ſhee might bee. Yet
was I not frighted, but rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to laughter, remembring an
Italian Comedy I had lately
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1672:32"/>
ſeene, in which <hi>Halequin</hi> faining
to come from the other World,
had a baggage not much diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
and therefore, after I had
ſtood a great while muſing, I ſtept
to her, and demanded who ſhee
was? I am <hi>Death,</hi> ſaid ſhee.
<hi>Death!</hi> (replied I, my heart fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
mee) and whither goe you
Miſtreſſe <hi>Death?</hi> I come to fetch
thee (ſaid ſhe). Alas! Muſt I then
die? No, but thou muſt goe alive
with mee, and make a journey
into the kingdome of the dead;
for ſince many departed have roſe
to ſee the living, it is no injuſtice
that one living ſhould deſcend to
viſit them, and that the dead bee
heard. Haſt thou not heard that I
have power to execute my ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
decrees? Diſrobe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
mee. Ha, ſighed I, in a cold
ſweat, Will you not let me weare
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1672:32"/>
my Cloathes? There is no need,
(ſaid ſhe) apparel will but hinder
you, beſides I eaſe all men of their
luggage, that they may walke
with more agility. There was no
contending, therefore I went after
her; but to tell you through what
by-wayes ſhee led mee is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
for I was tranſported be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
apprehenſion. As wee were
going, I doe not, (ſaid I) for all
this, ſee by any outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
that you are <hi>Death,</hi> becauſe
ſhe is painted without fleſh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of nothing but dry bones.
Thoſe Image-makers are fooles,
anſwered ſhee, and want inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for bones are not <hi>Death,</hi> but
the remainder of the Living.
You Mortals know her not, or
elſe ſhee would appeare in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of every one of you, and in
every ſeverall member lie depi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1672:33"/>
To die, is to finiſh life, and
to bee borne, is to beginne to die;
and the trueſt Image of <hi>Death</hi> is
a mans owne ſelfe, and not a
breathleſſe trunke or bare ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy.</p>
            <p>But I pray you, Why doe you
place Detractours, and Tell-tales,
in the <hi>Van</hi> next to your owne
perſon? becauſe (ſaid ſhee) there
are more that die by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of great ſpeakers, than by
diſeaſes, and more that are haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to ruine by the converſation
of flatterers and intermedlers,
than by Phyſicians practice:
though in the generall theſe are
my greateſt friends, and beſt
ſervants, and to this purpoſe thou
muſt underſtand, that moſt in the
world grow ſicke through exceſſe
and ſuperfluity of humours; but
die, by the meanes and diligence
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1672:33"/>
of him that adminiſters. So that
when you are asked of what Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
ſuch an one is dead, you
muſt not anſwer, Of a Feaver,
Pluriſie, Purple, or Peſtilence, but
he is dead by the hand of ſuch a
Phyſitian that hath beene well
paid, for it is requiſite that every
Trade ſhould live.</p>
            <p>As we grew thus familiar, wee
entred into a Vault, where the
dayes reflexe was betwixt light
and obſcurity. In the entry
whereof, upon one ſide I ſaw
three Statues armed and ſtirring,
of humane ſhape, yet hard to bee
diſtinguiſhed, and on the other
an hideous Monſter, that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
fought with them, one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
three, and three to one.
Knoweſt thou, ſaid <hi>Death,</hi> what
theſe are? Oh no! ſaid I, and I
truſt in God I never ſhall. And
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1672:34"/>
yet ſo it is, ſaid ſhee, that ſince
thy Nativity thou haſt never kept
other Company. Theſe are the
three capitall Enemies to the
Soule, the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and
the <hi>Divell:</hi> looke if they doe
not reſemble one another ſo
neare, that they are ſcarcely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
aſunder; ſo that if thou
entertaine but one of them, thou
maiſt bee aſſured thou haſt them
all three. An aſpiring man, thinkes
he hath all the World, and hath
got the Divell; a laſcivious man
beleeves hee hath the Fleſh, but
findes it the Divell; and ſo doe
the reſt. But what is ſhee (ſaid I)
with ſo many ſeverall faces, that
fights againſt them? Anſwer was
made, The Divell <hi>Money;</hi> who
hath bred a controverſie, uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
that the reſt have nothing
to doe where ſhe is, and that ſhee
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1672:34"/>
alone is all the three. Firſt, ſhee
grounds her diſpute with the
World, upon thoſe Proverbes
men ordinarily uſe, that <hi>There is
no other World but Money,</hi> that
<hi>Hee that hath no Money had better
be out of the World,</hi> that <hi>We baniſh
him the World from whom wee take
Money,</hi> and that <hi>All things give
place to Money.</hi> Againſt the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Enemy, ſhe ſaith, <hi>Money is
the Fleſh,</hi> witneſſe Whores and
Curtezans. And againſt the third,
ſhe makes uſe of your ſpeeches al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
that <hi>Nothing can be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that Divell Money,</hi> that <hi>Love
doth much, but Money doth all,</hi>
and that, <hi>That which Money can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe the Devill cannot effect.</hi>
Whatſoever the claime is, ſaid I,
The Devill Money needs no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutours,
ſeeing ſhe defends her
Cauſe ſo well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:1672:35"/>
Wee went forward to a place
where on one hand I perceived
Hell, and on the other Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and did heedfully conſider
Hell, becauſe it was a thing very
ſtrange. What lookeſt thou on,
ſaid <hi>Death?</hi> On Hell, ſaid I, and
methinkes by the aſpect, I have
ſeene it elſewhere. Where, (ſaid
ſhe)? I have ſeene it in the emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

               </gap>nother mans goods, in wicked
undertakings, in revenges, in the

the pride of corporations. But
as for Juſtice, I am glad to ſee it
in its purity, and had rather have
<hi>Death</hi> with Judgement, than Life
without it.</p>
            <p>At laſt wee deſcended into a
ſpacious Cave, circled in on all
ſides with very high Rampiers,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1672:35"/>
and filled with much people: and
here <hi>Death</hi> bad mee ſtay, for this
was the place of her Tribunall.
The hangings that adorned the
walles were words of <hi>Woe, alas,
griefe, ſighes, ill tidings, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi>
as certainely, beleeved, as
unregarded. Here Womens teares
were deceitfull to themſelves,
and unprevalent with others.
There ſorrow was excluded
from comfort, and cares were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vigilant, being converted into
Vermin to gnaw Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
whoſe uſurped honours made
them to ſuſpect all men. He ere
Envy had put on a mourning ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
and kept a continued faſt, it
being not in her power to hurt.
And there Ingratitude was knea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a kinde of Dough, mixt of
Pride and Ambition, of which
now ſhee framed Men, now De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1672:36"/>
All quivered with curſes and
imprecations, of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
the reaſon? one that
was by anſwered, O Deſtiny!
would you not have curſes heere,
where there are ſo many match-makers,
Lawyers, and impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours?
Doe you not know that
there is nothing more frequently
ſpoken of in your Region, than
<hi>Curſed be hee that married us, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the houre I firſt beheld thee,</hi> and
<hi>Ill h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p betide him that firſt brought
us together. Curſed bee the Lawyer
who counſelled mee to follow this
Cauſe that hath undone mee.</hi> And
in other matters, <hi>Curſt that I am,
I would I might never come into
Heaven, if I ſaid this or that;</hi> and
<hi>The Devill take mee, if ever hee
ſpake to mee of any ſuch thing.</hi> But
what is all this to the purpoſe,
ſaid I? and what have theſe to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1672:36"/>
doe with <hi>Deaths</hi> Judgement
Hall? Ignorant man! ſaid the
other, If there were not ſo many
contrivers of weddings, would
there bee ſo many dead and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
men? Is there any thing
deſtroyes ſo quickly, as the cavils
and circumventions of entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling
Lawyers? And doth there
any d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſooner, than hee that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates
himſelfe? No certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
therefore thou muſt conclude
that theſe are the principall Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of this Dominion, and of
the imperiall throne thou ſeeſt
there.</p>
            <p>At this, I lift up mine eyes,
and ſaw <hi>Death</hi> ſit in a chaire, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed
with many little <hi>Deaths,</hi>
as <hi>The Death of Love, the Death
of Hunger, the Death of Feare,</hi>
and <hi>the Death of Laughter,</hi> each
bearing a ſeverall Enſigne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1672:37"/>
               <hi>The Death of Love</hi> had very
little braines, and for Attendants
had <hi>Pyramus</hi> and <hi>Thiſbe, Hero</hi>
and <hi>Leander,</hi> with divers other
Lovers, ready to expire under her
Sickle, but by the rare miracles
of the intereſſed roſe againe.
About <hi>The Death of Hunger</hi>
were many Uſurers, who having
accumulated great wealth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
themſelves of neceſſary
meanes; letting their bodies fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
and their ſoules die, which
they had long before converted
into Gold and Silver. <hi>The Death
of Feare</hi> was richeſt, and moſt
ſtately, hemm'd in with Tyrants
and mighty men; ſuch as flie from
all, thought none purſueth, and
afford the world no good, but
this, that by their ſudden ſelfe
deſtruction through feare, ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and diſtruſt, they revenge
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1672:37"/>
themſelves the innocent, whom
they had before condemned and
ſlaine. <hi>The Death of Laughter</hi>
was the laſt, rounded with peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of quicke apprehenſion, but
late repentance, that live, as if
there were no Juſtice to feare, and
die, as if there were no mercy to
bee hoped. And theſe are they,
that when it is ſaid, Reſtore what
you have taken, anſwer, <hi>You make
me die of Laughter.</hi> Conſider that
you are old, that ſinne findes not
any thing more to conſume in
you; forſake this Woman that
you unlawfully embrace. Regard
how the Devill mockes you, who
are now no more unto him but an
improfitable booty. <hi>You make mee
die of Laughter.</hi> Aske God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe,
and turne unto him,
for you have already one foot in
the grave. <hi>You make mee die of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1672:38"/>
Laughter,</hi> I was never more jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
never more luſty. And theſe
are they that being ſicke, when
they are exhorted to rely upon
God, and order their eſtate by a
religious will, anſwer, that they
have beene many times in the
ſame caſe: but finde themſelves
in the other World, before they
can be perſwaded they are going
thither. Heere I could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
my ſelfe, from this uſe,
Lord! thou haſt given but one
life and are there ſo many <hi>Deaths?</hi>
Grant, I beſeech thee, that if I
returne againe, I may change my
condition, and beginne to live
well, that I may die lamented.</p>
            <p>I had ſcarce uttered theſe
words, but I heard the voyce cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>The Dead, the Dead, the Dead;</hi>
and inſtantly ſaw the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne
to open, and the bodies of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1672:38"/>
men and women, halfe buried in
their winding-ſheets, to ariſe;
who ranked themſelves in order,
obſerving a ſilent taciturnity.
Take each his turne, ſaid <hi>Death,</hi>
when behold one of them came
near me with ſuch fury, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to feare the baſtinado. Helliſh
worldlings, ſaid he, What would
you with mee? Why let you mee
not alone, dead, and at reſt?
What have I done unto you? I
that without offending in part,
am defamed in all, and made
guilty of thoſe things I am alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
ignorant of? And what are
you, ſaid I, whom I neither
know nor underſtand? I am, ſaid
he, the unhappy <hi>Abraham Ninny,</hi>
that have bin here many years, and
yet you doe nothing but mocke
and deride mee. When any folly
or extravagancy is committed,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1672:39"/>
Oh! 'tis an <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſay you
preſently, Did you ever heare the
like? What a <hi>Ninny-hammer</hi> hee
is growne? Why, a very foole
would not have done it? But
know, that in acting and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
follies, you your ſelves are
all <hi>Abrahams,</hi> worſe than you
ſuppoſe mee to have beene. And
for proofe, Tell me, Have I made
any ridiculous wils as you men,
by which you command others
to doe thoſe things, which you
would never doe your ſelves?
Have I rebelled againſt the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
or hoped to renew my
youth? Have I ſtrived to reforme
Nature, and conteſted with her
in colouring and poudering my
haire? Have I ſworne untruths?
Am I faithleſſe in thoſe things
which I have promiſed, as you
are dayly? Have I beene a ſlave
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1672:39"/>
to my money? or played away
my eſtate? Have I conſumed it in
banquets? or given it to Curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans?
Did I ſuffer my ſelfe to bee
maſterd by my Wife? or beleeve
that I might rely on that man,
who at my perſwaſion betraied
his friend that truſted in him?
Did I marry my ſelfe to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd
of an inconſtant Miſtreſſe?
or credit that there might bee
built any ſure foundation on the
ſlippery Wheele of Fortune?
Have I eſteemed them happy that
conſume their dayes in Princes
Courts, for the vanity of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
looke? or taken delight
in Hereticall Controverſies, to
bee accounted witty? Have I
boaſted unto people that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
mee? or beleeved in Witches
and framers of Nativities? If <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
have done no ſuch foppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1672:40"/>
of what folly can you accuſe
him? Poore <hi>Ninny!</hi> raſh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent
that you are, wherefore
doe you impute your diſorders
unto mee, that never learnt any
thing but patience; and was of
ſo innocent and naturall a life,
that it added an impoſſibility to
wrong any man.</p>
            <p>As wee were thus diſcourſing,
another that walked very grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
came to mee, and with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
eye, ſaid, Looke this
way. What is your Ladiſhip, ſaid
I, you that ſpeake ſo imperiouſly,
and preſume to bee reſpected, in a
place where all are equall? I am
(ſaid ſhe) <hi>Queene Richard,</hi> whom
if thou knoweſt not, yet thou
haſt often heard of; for you that
live are ſo devilliſh, that the dead
cannot bee excepted from your
malice. If you ſee an old wall, an
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1672:40"/>
old hat, a thread-bare cloake,
ragged coate, or a woman that
hath a treaſury of years upon her,
you ſay inſtantly, that they are as
old as <hi>Queene Richard.</hi> But you are
mad, my time was better than
yours: and to juſtifie what I ſay,
heare but your ſelves talke. Now
if a Mother thinkes to inſtruct
her Daughter in modeſty, and
ſay, Daughter, it is fitting that a
Virgin that will conſerve her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
ſhould alwayes keepe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
within the bounds of ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe,
and looke downeward:
her Daughter will arrogantly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
Mother, that was a cuſtome
in <hi>Queene Richards</hi> time. 'Tis for
men to looke upon the Earth, as
upon the matter from which they
were formed; and for women to
looke upon men, as being extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from them. If a Father ſay
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1672:41"/>
to his Sonne, Sonne, feare God,
keepe his Commandements, pray
unto him when you riſe, and
when you goe to bed; eate not
without bleſſing, and riſe not
without giving thankes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> play not,
ſweare not: hee will alleage the
ſame author, Father, that was the
faſhion in <hi>Queene Richards</hi> dayes.
So that, hee is derided that rules
himſelfe according to holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions,
and men are ſooner
knowne by their oathes than
beards.</p>
            <p>But leaving this, that you may
underſtand the dead are not all
ſo lockt up in eternall quiet, but
that their deſires have freedome
of enquiry, Is there any newes
ſtirring? How ſtands the ſtate of
Europe? The Spaniſh Fleets goe
well enough, ſaid I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of late
yeares the Hollanders beginne to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1672:41"/>
take rude tribute from them.
And the Genoes have by way of
bancke encroached ſo farre on his
Principalities, that (like Leeches)
they not onely ſtop the veines,
but draw the mines dry. Sonne,
ſaid ſhee, as long as the King of
Spaine ſhall have the Hollanders
for Enemies, the way to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
will never be free. And as for
the Genoes, they are likely to
become a ſtately Senate, (like
their City) If the Canker enter
not their magazin of ſtore, and
immoderate luſt, convert all in
Bordello. But, how goes the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of the world? There is much
to bee ſaid thereupon, ſaid I, you
have touched a ſtring that makes
a noiſe indeed: every man hath
his credit in himſelfe, every one is
eſteemed, and every one doth all
things in point of honour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:1672:42"/>
There is credit in all eſtates,
yet ſhee ſhifts places every day,
and is by this time ſeven ſtages
under ground. Thoſe that ſteale,
ſay it is to maintaine their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
and that they had rather rob
than begge. Thoſe that begge, ſay
it is to keepe their credit, and
that they had rather begge than
ſteale. Thoſe that beare falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and thoſe that murder ſay
the ſame thing. And all men call
credit that which tends moſt to
their profit, and (preſuming on
their owne worth and eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
undervalew and defame the
reſt. All is now perverted. Lying
is counted vertue, wiles and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are the chiefeſt qualities of a
Cavalier, and inſolency and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency
are the badges of genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
Heretofore the Ilanders were
men of credit, and kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1672:42"/>
in a moderation of all
things; but now there are ill
tongues abroad, that ſay, Savages
may inſtruct them, and that their
abſtinence is more for covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
than ſobriety.</p>
            <p>Counſellours and Lawyers,
How doe they thrive? As neſts of
Ants, that from one breed a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.
Juſtice that in ancient dayes
went naked, as repreſenting ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
is now ſo ſwadled with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
as if ſhe were a neſt of Spices.
And whereas heretofore we had
but one booke of Lawes, there
are now a thouſand, the cauſe of
ſo many ſquablings &amp; diviſions,
being every ones private expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If you goe to ſome Lawyers,
let your cauſe bee what it will,
they will aſſure you good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding,
and tell you, 'tis a faire
<hi>quaere,</hi> and wants nothing but ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1672:43"/>
but that at that inſtant they
are ſomething buſie, about a caſe
betweene <hi>Iohn Aſh</hi> and <hi>Iohn Okes,</hi>
ſo that they cannot minde it.
Yet if you will call ſome other
time, they will reviſe it better.
And after you have well paid
them, (for money is the ſpirit of
the worke, and the true light of
their underſtanding) you ſhall
reap nothing but protraction, and
may without difficulty inſtruct
your ſelfe the event. Happy are we
(ſaid the Queene) that are free
from ſuch diſturbances! but I
beleeve there are many good and
honeſt men amongſt them, that
may bee Antipodes to thoſe thou
deſcribeſt.</p>
            <p>Doth <hi>Venice</hi> ſtand yet? How?
Stand? Yes (ſaid I) it ſtands with
a vengeance: for that is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
that maintaines it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1672:43"/>
ſelfe, beyond all conſcience. But
if they ſhould reſtore what they
unjuſtly detaine from others,
none need to ſuſpect their pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
I muſt needs ſay it is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
State, a Citie founded in the
Water, a Treaſurie and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in the Aire, and a Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
whom many dread. But 'tis
withall, the channell and ſinke
of Monarchies, by which they
purge the filth of Peace and
Warre. The Turke ſuffers them
to moleſt Chriſtians, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
permit them to injure the
Turke, and they tolerate one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
to miſchiefe both the one
and the other; ſo that by others
diſſention, they maintaine their
owne vaſtneſſe, which will ſwell
them up, till their great ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
burſt them.</p>
            <p>But methinkes thou ſpeakeſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1672:44"/>
not of <hi>England,</hi> (ſaid the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatreſſe)
Canſt thou bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull
of thine owne Soyle?
Tis not for want of duty, replied
I, but becauſe it is too full of
ſplendour for me to comment on
without admiration. Pietie in the
Prince, Juſtice in the Magiſtrate,
Religion in the Miniſter, and
Obedience in the Subject, having
ſo abſolute glory, that not onely
her bordering Nations congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
her Peace, but all the World
ſtands gazing at her opulency,
who is the ſparkling Diamond in
the univerſall Ring. I am glad
(anſwered <hi>Queene Richard</hi>) that
goodneſſe and fidelity have ſo

will hereafter reſtraine thoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies,

hee ſeeing mee ſtare, ſaid, My art

therefore liſten, or I ſhall make
you, ſince you were brought hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to that end. Thinke you that
all that are wedded are married?
You deceive your ſelves by the
juſt halfe; know there bee many
married that live as in ſingle life,
and many of a ſingle life that live
as if they were married. And
there bee many men that marry
and die Batchelours from their

die Virgins from their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands:

but you muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
it, becauſe wee wanted you to
unriddle them; they being truer
than wee tooke them for, and of

mouth. Command therefore (ſaid
hee) that henceforth a more reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend

<q>
                  <l>Many Women ſhall become Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</l>
                  <l>And the Children that they doe beare</l>

            <p>

Can you except againſt this?
I tell you there are many married
men, that if they either would or
could make an exact ſearch, would
finde thoſe Children to bee none
of theirs, that call them Father.
A Womans belly is very ſubject
to caution; and Children being
got in obſcurity, it is very hard to
finde out the Labourers: we muſt
beleeve the depoſition of the
Wife, and many times the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
How many people doe
you thinke there will bee at the
latter day, who hold now great
rankes in the world, that will bee
conſtrained to acknowledge for
their Fathers, Pages of their
houſholds, followers, Phyſicians,
Gentlemen Uſhers, and may bee
Coachmen that have beene well

will then finde themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Poſterity, and true Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours

            <p>Having ſpoken, <hi>Erra Pater</hi> left

&amp; yet I never ſpeak nor open
my lips. The Latins call me <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
and make uſe of mee to fill
up the lines and periods in

doe mee the favour when you goe
backe, to relate that you have
ſeene <hi>Alter,</hi> cloathed in white,
who writes nothing, ſayes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
nor hath ever done any
thing; and that all that cite and

henceforth by your mediation, I
may no more bee the Ideots <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,</hi>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1672:48"/>

and accuſe him of their imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies,
who is your ſuppliant for

departed, and gave place to Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>A man (hee was) of aſpect
good enough, if hee had not had
a paire of hornes upon his head,
and made ſignes as if hee would
have beate mee; at which being
nothing daunted, Who brought
hither (ſaid I) this <hi>Signior Cornu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to?</hi>
which words were hardly ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
but behold us both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the eares, till the dead
parted us. I doe not diſallow of
the quality, ſaid he, becauſe there
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1672:48"/>
are greater men than my ſelfe that
weare the horne, but yet me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkes
the world might ſpeake
ſomething of them, and not all
of me. What have I done, that
many others have not done a
thouſand times more? The horne,
hath it found its end in mee? or
have I rebelled againſt my ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
with it? Have I enhaunc'd
the price of lanthornes, inke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hornes,
or poſthornes? and is
there not enough to make knife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handles,
and ſhooing-hornes?
Wherefore then doe your ſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drell
Poets afflict mee? And of
what doe you condemne mee,
when there was never beaſt of
my condition more peaceable?
They ſhall not leave thee yet,
ſaid I, but torment thee more,
ſuch a ſcope of matter I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
when I returne. But I will
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1672:49"/>
hinder thee, ſaid hee, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
wee fell againe to buffets.
In this agitation of ſpirit I awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and found my ſelfe in a
trembling ſweat, as weary as if
the combat had been reall. Then
calling to minde all that I had
ſeene, I converted it to my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
benefit; judging, that there
is no jeſting among the dead,
and that thoſe people, that are
out of all partiality and abuſe of
the World, are more fit to give
wholeſome Counſell than ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
advice.</p>

the forcing of his breath

the ſound thereof find obedience
in Marble, and in the dormitories
of the dead: for inſtantly all the
Earth beganne to move, and give
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1672:50"/>
place to bones, which ſought one
another. Thoſe which had beene
Generals, Captaines, Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,

out of their Sepulchres, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with courage, as if the
Trumpe had beene a ſignall to
warre. Covetous men iſſued ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
beleeving that it was for pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.
And they that had given

conceived it a ſummons to ſome

things I knew by their ſeverall

they not long ſeeke them, giving
mee therein a ſubject whereby to
admire the Power of God, in

tooke the legges or armes of their

               <p>When all the congregated

notable thing to ſee, how that
the Luxurious would not finde
their eyes, to the end that they
might not beare witneſſe againſt
them. Detractours would not
acknowledge their tongues, for
the ſame cauſe; and Theeves made
uſe of their feet, to flie from their
hands. Here I heard a Miſer aske
another (who becauſe hee was
embalmed, ſtaid for his entrals,
which were coffin'd farre off
from that place) if all that were
buried ſhould riſe againe, and if
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1672:51"/>

ſaw a troop of Cutpurſes, whofled
from their eares (which were

               <p>Theſe things I might well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
being mounted on a banke

I obeyed, and many handſome

me ill bred, and unmannerd,
for not giving more reſpect unto
them: (for in Hell alſo they have
this folly to beleeve that men
ought to reſpect them) They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
very jocond to ſee them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
of ſuch exquiſite frame,
and were not aſhamed of their
nakedneſſe. But when they knew
it was the Day of Wrath, and
their beauty beganne to accuſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1672:52"/>
them within, they put themſelves
in the way of the valley, with a
ſlow and lingring pace. One that
had beene thrice wedded, went
inventing excuſes for all her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands,
to whom ſeverally ſhe had
deeply ſworne, never to remarry:
and another ſaid, that ſhee had
forgot her night-cloathes, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that they would ſtay for her

place Phyſitians were thruſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
by Patients whom they
had diſpatched, by anticipation
of time. And in that a Judge
ſtood waſhing his hands, from
the innocent blood, that by bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery
lay upon him. Divers Divels
driving before them Vintners and
Tailours, a Lawyer peeping out
of his Tombe, asked whither
they went? and being told, to
the righteous <hi>Iudgement</hi> of God,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:1672:52"/>
to which they were all called;
he ſtrove to ſinke himſelfe deeper
into his Grave, ſaying, there is ſo
much way already made, if I
muſt deſcend lower. A Taverner
ſweating extreamly, a Devill told
him, that he did well to ſweat out
his water, for hee would burne
the better: and this was one of
thoſe, that kept a Taverne out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly,
but a Stewes within. A
bow-legged Tailour went inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
I have neither wine nor wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

more than I drinke, but why doe
they ſay I ſteale? which another
hearing told him, that hee did a

the Trade. In their walke
they met with highway robbers,

might well beare them company,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1672:53"/>
becauſe they were (<hi>a la mode</hi>) wild
Tailours. And after theſe went
Folly compaſſed on all ſides
with Poets, Muſicians, and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
and with all kindes of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
beſides, that were ignorant of
that Day, who in troopes came
to the Vale, where ſilence was
impoſed on all.</p>
               <p>The Throne was decked by
the hand of the Almighty, and
by the ſame Miracle, God was
adorned with himſelfe, with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
for the Elect, and wrath for
the Reprobate. The Sunne, Moon,
and Starres were his Footſtoole;
the winde was huſht, the waters
calme, the Earth ſtill, and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
ready to bee entranc'd for
the love ſhee bore her Children;
and all things in generall very
penſive and heavy. The Juſt were
buſied in giving thankes to God,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1672:53"/>
and praiſing his Goodneſſe, and
the Sinfull were inventing ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems,
to moderate their chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Angels witneſſed both by
their gate and phiſnomy, the care
they had to comfort and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Godly. And Divels
were ready to unfold their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations;
and leaſt that any ſhould
overſlip them, they had ſet the
tenne Commandements to keepe
the Doore, which was of that
ſtraightneſſe, that the leaneſt and
moſt mortified bodies were faine
to leave ſome part of their fleſh
behinde them, the entrance was
ſo narrow.</p>
               <p>The Examination beganne at
<hi>Adam,</hi> who was required to give
account for an Apple; which
<hi>Iudas</hi> minding, and the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hee was in, cried out, Woe
is me, what account ſhall I make,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1672:54"/>
that have ſold the Lord of Life,
and the Lambe of God? Then
paſſed the firſt Fathers, and after
the New Teſtament, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
who were all ſeated neare
the Chaire of Majeſty. And it
was a thing worthy of note to
ſee, that there was no reſpect of
perſons, but that Beggars and
Kings were mixt together, when
they went nigh the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
<hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> appeared,
and perceiving the wrath of God
(though encompaſſed with Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
<hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid, Hee that will
comply with the times, deſerves
no leſſe; and <hi>Herod,</hi> I cannot
goe into Paradiſe, for there thoſe
Innocents I ſlew will cry out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me, but why doe I chaffer?
Hel is a common Inne. A man
of a fiery looke ſtarted up, and
ſtretching out his arme, ſaid, See
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1672:54"/>
there my atteſtation of maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip!
Every one wondering, asked
the Porter who hee was? but hee
overhearing, anſwered, I am an
approved Maſter of Defence, and
theſe papers are Certificates of
my tried valour. Letting them
fall, a Devill ſtooped to gather
them up, but the Fencer was
more nimble than he, who leaped
backward, and drawing his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier,
ſaid, This Steele cannot be<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
equalled, and if you either budge
or ſpeake, I will quickly ſhew
that I am my Arts maſter. All the
Company beganne to ſmile, and
hee was commanded, ſeeing that
hee had but inſtructed an art,
which was one of the principall
cauſes of ſo many Duels and
ſlaughters, that hee ſhould goe
into Hell by a perpendicular
line: but hee anſwering, that hee
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1672:55"/>
was no Mathematician, a Divell
gave him a by-blow and caſt him
into the pit. Then came Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
and Stewards, who deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
an Advocate, a Divell an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
behold <hi>Iudas,</hi> a diſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and outcaſt Apoſtle, let him
ſpeake, for hee hath exerciſed
both profeſſions; which they
hearing, went to the other ſide,
and ſaw another Devill, that had
not hands enow to turne over
the leaves, were written againſt
them.</p>
               <p>Leave all theſe informations,
ſaid the ſtouteſt of them, and let
us compound; Ha, ha, ſaid hee,
that read the inditement, Doe
you demand compoſition? Then
'tis a ſigne your game is naught.
This they underſtanding, and
that no offers would be accepted,
tooke the way of the Fencer,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1672:55"/>
becauſe they had beene as good
men of their hands as hee, and
better. They being gone, Loe an
unfortunate paſtry Cooke, whoſe
adverſe party beganne to accuſe
him; which hee ſeeing, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by proofe, that hee had put
more kindes of meate into his
pies and paſties, than there were
beaſts in <hi>Noahs</hi> Arke (there being
neither Rats, Mice, nor Flies)
turned his backe, and leaving the
word in the Devils mouth, went
to ſee if the place were hot. Then
came Philoſophers, who made
ſyllogiſmes againſt their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And Poets, who would have
perſwaded the omnipotent, that
hee was that <hi>Iupiter</hi> whom
they had ſo often nominated
in their workes. <hi>Virgil</hi> alleaged
his <hi>Sicelides Muſae,</hi> ſaying, that it
was the figure of the Nativity:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1672:56"/>
and <hi>Orpheus</hi> as the moſt ancient
Poet, ſtood up to ſpeake for all;
but a Divell accuſing him, for
having inſtructed the way of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
love to mankinde, hee was
commanded to enter once more
into Hell, to try if hee could get
out againe; and obeying ſerved
as a Guide to his Companions.
A rich Uſurer knocked, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
asked what hee would have,
was told that the ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements
kept the Doore, and
that hee had never kept them. In
that which concernes keeping,
ſaid hee, it is impoſſible, I have
ſwerved; the firſt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt have none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
gods but me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and I think I have
obſerved it, for I have kept Gold
(the worldlings god) ſo ſecret,
that neither others nor my ſelfe
might make it the object of their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1672:56"/>
veneration. The ſecond, <hi>Thou
ſhalt not make to thy ſelfe any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Image,</hi> and I have kept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots
and wedges theſe many
yeares, that there might neither
ſtampe nor image come upon
them. The third, <hi>Thou ſhalt not
take the Name of the Lord thy
God in vaine,</hi> and I have never
ſworne in vaine, but alwayes for
ſome great intereſt. The fourth,
<hi>Remember that thou keepe holy the
Sabbath day,</hi> and I have all the
weeke long provided hiding
places for my treaſure, that on
that day it might not moleſt my
reſt. <hi>Honour thy Father and thy
Mother,</hi> I have alwayes greatly
reverenced them, in that I have
given them the preheminence,
eſpecially in all bad actions.
<hi>Thou ſhalt doe no murder,</hi> and I
did never ſcarce eate, becauſe that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1672:57"/>
to feed is to kill hunger. <hi>Thou
ſhalt not commit adultery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I never
did it, for women in that way are
not tractable without money;
but if you will let mee come in
(ſaid he, who beganne to be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with ſo many interrogatories)
let us not looſe time, for hee was
ſo great an enemy to loſſe, that
hee would husband time it ſelfe;
but ſaying this, he was led where
he deſerved. Divers Theeves fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
ſome of them ſo active,
that they ſaved themſelves in
leaping from the ladder. Lawyers
coveted the like good fortune, but
they were ſet to goe through the
eye of a needle. Scriveners denied
their name, ſaying, they were Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries,
but Proctours ſtood to
it, ſaying, they were the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of others good; but there
was no defence for either of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1672:57"/>
them. One Devill ſeeing a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
an Apothecary, a Surgeon,
and a Barber comming, gave them
thankes for moſt of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
ſen<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> thither by their meanes;
and commanded ſome of his vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals
to uſher them downe, that
they might aſſay if they could
cure the burning Feaver. Another
perceiving one to peere out of an
hole where hee had hid himſelfe,
asked what hee was? who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
an Empericke. What!
Saltinbanke, Mountebanke, and
my Friend, ſaid the Devill! It
were better for thee to bee upon
ſome ſcaffold at ſome corner of a
Street, to paſſe away the time
with idler perſons; but ſince thou
art come, thou ſhalt not want pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment:
goe thy wayes into that
quarter, and ſee if thy balſame
bee efficacious againſt ſcalding;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1672:58"/>
ſo he went on his Friends word.
The plea of Taverne-keepers was,
that they had quenched the thirſt
of many poore perſons; and of
Tailours, that they had cloathed
many; but this hindred their
diſpatch. Then Bankers deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
treaty, but their Sentence
was pronounced, and bils of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
were given them, to bee
paid out of <hi>Pluto's</hi> Coffers,
where there is no bottome. And
afterwards place was given to
Women, who approached with
pleaſing and ſmiling countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
endeavouring by thoſe
meanes to prevaile: but as ſoone
as they ſaw the horrid aſpects of
Divels, they beganne to ſhrike
out, and antedate their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
Bailiffes, Sergeants, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals,
and many more were yet
to bee judged, who being called,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1672:58"/>
ſaid they would willingly ſuffer,
without any further triall.</p>
               <p>The laſt was an Aſtrologer,
crying out, that they were miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in the calculation of yeares,
and that it yet could not bee the
Day of <hi>Iudgement;</hi> becauſe the
Heaven of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Heaven had not finiſhed
their courſe: but the Devill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buking
him, ſaid, I wonder that
among ſo many Heavens which
you have made in your life-time,
you were never ſo provident as to
erect one for your ſelfe! for
which default, you muſt now bee
tranſported into Hell, which was
accordingly executed.</p>
               <p>Upon this the <hi>Iudgement</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
the Throne was taken up,
the ſhadowes fled to their place,
the Aire was filled with milde
<hi>Zephirs,</hi> the Earth was enamel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1672:59"/>
with flowers, and the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
were cleare and tranſlucent;
and I was in my bed, more joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
than ſorrowfull, that I was
not yet dead: therefore that I
might make uſe of my Dreame, I
undertooke a conſtant reſolve, to
keepe a ſtrict watch over my

no more delayes to hope for, and

into a meddow a thouſand

in the inventions of Poets; where
looking about, I eſpied two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull
Rivers, that in their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinthian
<hi>Meanders</hi> water'd it.
The waters of the one were bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
of the other ſweet, yet they
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1672:60"/>
mingled together with ſo peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a purling murmur, that they
charmed the eares of thoſe that
heard them, and qualified affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
anxiety. Theſe in their
ſportive motion directed mee to a
goodly faire Palace, of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtructure, ſeated in the midſt
of the Field. The portals were
of Dorian worke, richly inlaid,
and on the pedeſtall, baſes, pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
corniſhes, chapters, archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traves,
frizes, and other adjuncts,
there were engraved all the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies

in letters of Gold, cut
upon blacke Marble.</p>
            <q>

               <l>Bleſt and moſt happy is this place,</l>
               <l>In ever youthfull Love;</l>
               <l>Who crownes the noble and the baſe,</l>
               <l>As their demerits move.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The diverſity of ſtones and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
delighted admirably the
ſight: the portall was ſpacious,
and the doore perpetually open,
to let thoſe freely enter whom
ſingularity brought; and the
place of Porter was allotted to a
woman, who ſeemed to be of the
nymphall race; her viſage was
celeſtiall, lineaments amiable,
and body perfectly ſtraight, ſhee
was cloathed in cloath of Gold
and Silver, glittering with pearles
and ſtones of price, and was an
enchantment to all that beheld
her, leading captive their iron
hearts in chaines of Adma<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1672:61"/>
and though ſhee was in all things
like her name <hi>Beauty,</hi> yet did ſhe
not inſult nor deny entrance to
any, if they paid for their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
a good looke; of whoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
I made uſe of and went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the firſt Court, where I found
abundance of all Sexes, but ſo
changed from their priſtine grace
that the very memory of it was
forgotten; inſtead whereof they
had put on Loves livery, dejected
eyes, yellow reſemblance, and
mournfull repreſentations.</p>
            <p>Their talke reflected not upon
the faith that is to bee kept with
friends, loyalty to maſters, nor
reſpect to blood; but their kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
were mediatours to their
owne alliance. Servants became
miſtreſſes, and miſtreſſes ſervants.
Women contracted amity with
their Husbands acquaintance, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1672:62"/>
Husbands grew intimate with
their Wives companions.</p>
            <p>On this medly of affections
did I ſtare, when I perceived a
creature not perfectly man, nor
rightly woman, but partaking of
both; who went and came
through the multitude, having
on a looſe garment, ſpotted over
with eyes and ears; which mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
and the authority ſhe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
I demanded her condition,
and what ſhe did? to which two
queſtions ſhee thus anſwered mee.
I am <hi>Jealouſie,</hi> the greateſt cauſe
of the increaſe of theſe ſicke and
mad perſons, which thou ſeeſt;
nevertheleſſe I am not engaged to
heale, but to chaſtiſe them. Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
not mee of any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,
for it is a miracle when I
ſpeake truth; becauſe I leſſen
from my ſelfe in the delivery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1672:62"/>
nothing but ſleights and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices:
but goe to that aged man
that walkes there, for hee is the
overſeer of the Palace, and (may
bee) will inſtruct you (though
ſlowly) in all that you require.</p>
            <p>I did ſo, and found him to bee
<hi>Time,</hi> of whom I intreated a
ſight of the roomes and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and that I might viſit ſome
fooles of my acquaintance, whom
I conjectured were there. He told
me hee was buſie in curing the
diſeaſed, yet notwithſtanding
ſhewed mee all things, in giving
mee liberty to walke about. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the firſt Court, I entred into
the <hi>Maidens</hi> chamber, (for
the women were ſeparated) and
theſe were kept in the ſtrongeſt
hold, where the wals were thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt,
becauſe of their vehement
and violent paſſions: here I tooke
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1672:63"/>
notice of one that lamented, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
jealous of a married woman;
and of another that was carried
with burning affection to a yong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
yet durſt not declare it. How
one writ letters full of ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
where there were more lines
daſht out than good words; and
another ſtudied with her glaſſe
how to ſmile and ſimper, and act
the fictive humours, ſhe meant to
play her Lover: that eate oat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale,
plaiſter, jeat, and ſmall
coale, to obtaine a pale colour:
and this intreated her ſervant,
that in the mornings hee would
give her a Serenade of Muſique
at her chamber window, which
implied, that hee ſhould publiſh
to all the neighbours that he was
her enamor'd; this held love
letters which ſhe let fly through
windowes, and thruſt under
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1672:63"/>
doores: and that proteſted to
her friend her heart was his, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
him not to require any
thing more; which he promis'd,
and the foole beleeved. Some
would marry, to love with more
liber<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y: and others deſired to be
with men already married, and
theſe were rank'd in the number
of incurable.</p>
            <p>Having conſidered all, I durſt
not ſtay any longer, knowing by
experience that a man runnes great
hazard among ſuch allurers: and
that hee that gettes cleareſt off,
is often condemned to ſlavery in
the bonds of marriage, which is
an engagement to repentance all
his life long, without other hope
of redemption than by Death:
for there is no order to redeeme
thoſe that are captives in the
chaines of wedlocke, as there is
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:1672:64"/>
for them that are under the hands
of the Turke. I went therefore to
the <hi>Married Women:</hi> and ſaw
many of them whom their Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
kept tied and cloiſtered up,
to hinder the execution of their
deſignes, that broke both Priſon
and chaines, and became m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dder
than before. Some fawned on
and flattered their Husbands,
when they had moſt minde to
abuſe them: and ſome ſtole their
money to pay their confederates,
yet never tooke heed to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
till the eſtate was ended:
others went to heare Sermons,
and on pilgrimages of Devotion,
but it was to get the grace and
mercy of their holy brethren,
by ſacrificing to <hi>Venus:</hi> and others
went to Baths, ſooner to pollute
than cleanſe themſelves. Such an
one recompenc'd her Husbands
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1672:64"/>
ſinnes in the ſame kinde, verify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the adage, that <hi>None take
greater delight to be revenged, than
a woman when ſhe avenges her ſelfe
on her Huſband</hi> with advantage.
Such another went to ſee a Play,
that ſhe might be ſpoken with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Acts. And this laſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
her Coach ſo well, that
ſhee was ſcarce ever out of it; of
which deſiring a reaſon, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
(ſaid ſhee) I love to bee ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
Among this honourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle
thoſe were not ſeene,
whoſe Husbands were employed
in Warre, Embaſſages, Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
or forraigne Affaires; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that they depending upon
none other in that time, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
themſelves within the
bounds of chaſtity, and as people
exorcis'd, were not reputed mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of this Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:1672:65"/>
The next partition was of
<hi>Widowes,</hi> armed with experience
and knowledge, who counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
modeſty and piety, yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered
to their deſires. One with
her right eye wept for her dead
Husband, and with her left laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to her living Friend; another
was more muffled and vailed with
paſſion than mourning, receiving
joyfully the preſent, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the abſent. And others laid
wagers, whoſe vailes and hukes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
them beſt, endeavouring to
convert that ſad attire into allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Thoſe that were old, imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
the actions of youth: and
thoſe that were more young,
made uſe of the time, that they
might not repent in their age.
There were ſome adored, and
ſome adorers, who being devout,
were loves penitents, and in that
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1672:65"/>
reſpect condemned to faſt from
meats they moſt longed after, for
the carnall have alſo their Lent.
Many outwardly laid on modeſt
colours, though inwardly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
enough: and many were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
inſolent, and having heretofore
beene Maſters, would now make
uſe of that imperious power; ſo
that the Phyſitian had much adoe
with them.</p>
            <p>All theſe infirmities proceed
onely through idleneſſe, for
where that is, luſt findes eaſie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.
There were ſome Women
who accepted more letters of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſe,
than a Banquer of <hi>Genoa</hi>
or a <hi>German</hi> Hoorder, upon cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
of their inſatiable deſires.
Some would not be ſeene by him
that was the viſitour, but by the
unexpected: and thoſe that were
moſt ſubtle, made uſe of their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1672:66"/>
Phyſicians. One ſpake to an
Aſtrologer, to caſt a figure for her
future life; and another deſired
of a Magitian ſecrets whereby
ſhe might bee beloved. And how
many did I ſee, that would have
ſeemed as ridiculous as <hi>Eſops</hi>
Crow, if their periwigs and
frontlets of haire had been pluckt
off! but, at laſt I got from them,
ſhaking my head, and went to
the mens quarter, on the other
ſide of the building.</p>
            <p>At my arrivall I obſerved, that
the <hi>Batchelours</hi> greateſt folly was
obſtinacy, for every one knew his
errours, hut would not amend.
O, that I ſaw many Gallants
brave in apparrell, that had not
ſo much as one penny! Many
Roarers that had heretofore boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
and bragg'd of Ladies fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
that would have beene very
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1672:66"/>
glad, if I had invited them to
dinner! And how many were
there that had no bread, and yet
felt the temptations of the fleſh?
Some counterfeited the amiable,
wearing perfumes and long lockes
not remembring that women take
alwayes the ſuperiority of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
upon themſelves; and others,
by their vaunts of warre would
paſſe for Duelliſts, yet forgot
that women are ever fearefull, and
quake at the ſight of a weapon;
others at midnight walked the
round about their Miſtreſſes lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings;
and others became amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
through infection, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
with them that were ſo. This
man on Sundayes went from
Church to Church, to feed his
eye with variety, and that went
from houſe to houſe to exerciſe
his wit. Some complained of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1672:67"/>
more than they ſuffered, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
endured without opening
their mouthes. Thoſe whoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
deſpiſed things beneath
them, pretended to Subjects ſo
high, that they loſt their deſire;
and thoſe that were diſtruſtfull of
their owne worth (though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
people of judgement and
underſtanding) applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
onely to meane objects.
<hi>Husbands</hi> were enchained, yet
not leſſe mad; for ſome forſooke
their Wives, and followed their
neighbours; and others tooke
for friends their Wives friends,
and for Goſſips the Mothers of
their Children.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Widowers</hi> practis'd in torments
paſt, ſearched reſt where it was to
be found, loving as ſhort a while,
and as long as they pleaſed; here
being amorous, there jealous;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:1672:67"/>
and that which I found admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in them all, was that they
confeſſed themſelves Fooles, yet
left not to be ſo. <hi>Men</hi> that were
moſt diſcreet, related their good
fortune to thoſe that publiſhed
their diſgraces; whileſt ſhallow
Dolts were commended for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy.
Some flattered the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-maid,
to get acceſſe to the
Miſtreſſe, and others ſuborn'd
the Miſtreſſe to overcome her.
Theſe had their pockets ſtuft
with amorous lines, ſealed with
ſilke, and endorſed with gold; and
had likewiſe bracelets, hat bands,
knots, and favours, whereof they
made ſurvey: and theſe were the
Husbands friends, and voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
employed themſelves to eaſe
his cares, lending him Horſes,
Coach, and money; whileſt they
hurried his Wife abroad to Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1672:68"/>
Playes, and Banquets. There
were divers Woers of Widowes,
ſome that were beloved, and ſome
not; ſome that let themſelves ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
bee taken, and ſome that
caught others. And there were
many, that made their conqueſts
with love and money, and theſe
carried often the victory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they fought with double
armes; yet ſometimes they got
the foile, and had not whereby to
reſiſt poverty.</p>
            <p>Having at leaſure ſurveyed all,
I went backe into the firſt Court;
where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Time</hi> thruſt amongſt the
Company that encreaſed dayly,
and by his induſtry recovered
ſome. <hi>Jealouſie</hi> puniſhed thoſe,
who were moſt confident in the
ſubject they lov'd. <hi>Memory</hi> rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
over old ſores, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi>
was hid in a darke hole, and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1672:68"/>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> had her eyes pluckt out.
And having contemplated the
diverſity of Diſſimulation, I ſaw
a litle wicket open, where <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi>
and <hi>Infidelity</hi> gave liberty
of eſcape to ſome few: therefore
to enjoy the preſent occaſion, I
doubled my pace, to get out with
the firſt. When my Boy came
and drew the Curtaine, telling
mee that it was broad day; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I awaked, ſomewhat dulled
at my long ſtay, yet comforted in
this, that I have found it by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and mine owne experience,
that <hi>Love is nothing but meere and
naturall folly.</hi>

of the Streets; but expoſed
my ſelfe withall to the deriſion
of the Inhabiters, and as if it

Quarrels through Scarres and

of Gluttony, gourmandizing and
drinking; and not long after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Market-place, where all

            <p>In this diſtraction I was called
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1672:70"/>
unto by an Old man, of meane
and tatterd attire, but of awfull
port, and judicious reſpect. What
are you, Good man, ſaid I? Doe
you envy my content? Let mee
alone; you Old men are alwayes
troubling the mirth of Young
people, yet would not willingly
leave pleaſures your ſelves. You
are going out of the World, and
I am but newly come into it, give
me (therefore) leave to rejoyce
and bee merry; the venerable
man (diſſembling his griefe) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to ſmile; Sonne, ſaid hee,
'tis not to hinder nor maligne
thy deſires, but through pity that
I ſtrive to with hold thee. Knoweſt
thou what the value of an houre

What have the dayes that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready

            <p>I muſt acknowledge, grave Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

theſe rents come from ſuch as
make ſhew to helpe me, and theſe

I will carry thee into the chiefe
Street, where all things are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
in open view, and ſhew thee
how it is in its <hi>Interior</hi> parts; for
thou ſeeſt nothing here, but the
ſhell and appearance. What is
that principall Streets name (ſaid
I) whither you will carry me? It
is called (ſaid hee) <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> 'tis
the Street where the World both
beginnes and ends, and very great,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:1672:72"/>
for there is not any one whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
but hath either an houſe, or

conſtant dwellers, and others ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
there being divers kindes of
Hypocrites. See you that Fellow

Sonne, now a Gentleman.
Would you take that man for a

here that appeares in its

full of lyes, in what part ſoever
you examine it. And if you note

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1672:73"/>
onely out of ſimulation: and
that of all ſinners, there is none ſo
preſumptuous as the Hypocrite;
in as much as other bad livers
ſinne onely againſt God, but hee
ſinnes againſt God, and with
God alſo, ſince hee makes him an
inſtrument of his ſinne; and for
this cauſe our Saviour, willing
to ſhew how amongſt all others
they were hatefull to him, after
hee had given many affirmative
precepts to his Diſciples, he gave
them one negative, ſaying, <hi>Bee
not ſad like Hypocrites:</hi> and as he
taught them by many Parables,
and Compariſons, what they
ſhould bee, now lights, now ſalt,
ſometimes like Gueſts, ſometimes

            <p>Upon this diſcourſe wee came

happy man, who haſt found ſo
many Friends, that accompany
not onely thy ſadneſſe, but ſeeme
to exceed it. Good Sir, conſider a
little their anguiſh. O, that there
is nothing but vanity! anſwered
hee, all that thou ſeeſt is not done
but by conſtraint, though thoſe
exterior outſides ſeeme to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay
it. Seeſt thou thoſe waxe
lights, torches, and the reſt of the
hearſe, who would not ſay but
that they light and accompany
ſomething? and that it is for
ſomething that all this funerall
pompe is made? but know, that
that which is within the coffin is
nothing, for the body was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in its life time, Death hath
leſſened that nothing, and all the
honours that are given unto it
ſerve for nothing; but this is done,
becauſe the dead have their vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1672:75"/>
and State, as well as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
There is nothing within but
Earth, not able ſo much as to
produce fruit, and more filthy to
looke on, than the dirt on which
thou treadeſt, that deſerves no
honour, and on which the ſhare
and plough have no predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
and that dolefulneſſe,
which thou thinkeſt to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in theſe Friends, is nothing
but anger and madneſſe, that
they are not ranked according to
their degree and ambition. The
Widower alſo is not ſo afflicted
for his Wives death as thou ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineſt,
but 'tis the expence that
vexes him, ſeeing hee might have
performed the ceremony with
more eaſe, and leſſe coſt. He mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
within himſelfe that ſhe hath
wrong'd him, in that ſeeing ſhee
was to die, ſhee did not die ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1672:76"/>
without putting him to
ſuch charge in Phyſicians, Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians,
and Apothecaries, who by
their bils diſpoſe his goods into
parts: hee hath buried two with
this, and takes ſuch delight in
being a Widower, that hee is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a treaty already with one,
whom hee was a wel-willer unto
during his old Wives ſickneſſe.
Thou ſhalt ſee him ſhortly riſen,
from thoſe deadly habiliments
which interre him.</p>
            <p>I was wonder-ſtrooke at theſe
ſpeeches. Ah! that the things of
this World (ſaid I) are farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
from what wee ſee them!
hereafter I will bee more reſerved
in ſpending my judgement, and
thoſe things I ſhall cleareſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
will moſt doubt of. This
buriall vaniſhed ſo ſoone from
our eyes, as if wee had not ſeene
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1672:76"/>
it, or beene likely to have made
the ſame journey; and as if the
deceaſed had not ſhewed us the
way, ſpeaking in a ſilent lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
I goe before to ſtay for
you, whileſt you keepe the reſt
company, as I have heretofore
done, with as much neglect, and
leſſe devotion.</p>
            <p>Wee were hindred from thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
on this, by a noiſe which
we heard in an houſe behinde us;
where wee were no ſooner entred
but the aſſembled beganne a lowd
cry, accompanying the ſobs and
grones of a woman, newly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Widow.</p>
            <p>Their ſorrowes were very live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(yet availed not the dead) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
minute they wrung their
hands, and ſent forth ſighes that
ſeemed to proceed from the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of their hearts. The chambers
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1672:77"/>

               </gap> Comforters ſaid,
Alas! all your teares are to no
end, and I am unable to comfort
you, being more grieved at your
ſorrow, than if it were mine
owne: another, you ought not
ſo much to macerate your ſelfe,
becauſe your husbands good life
aſſures you that hee is in bliſſe:
and another, that ſhee muſt bee
patient, and conforme her ſelfe to
the will of Heaven; which words
made her double her complaints,
and with greater vehemency to
afflict her ſelfe; ſaying, O God!
Why doe I live after the loſſe of
ſo deare and loving a Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
O! that I am unhappy in
being borne! Woe is me! Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1672:77"/>
ſhall I goe? Who is there
now that will take into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
a poore woman? a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
Widow? and helpe her in
diſtreſſe?</p>
            <p>At this pauſe, all the reſt of the
Quire, with inſtrumentall diſcord
of their noſes and handkerchers,
deafened the houſe; and then I
found, that in ſuch occaſions wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
purge by their eyes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
ſome part of their bad hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours:
notwithſtanding I could
not bridle my ſelfe from partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating
ſome part of their griefe,
and to turne towards my Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
with theſe words. Pity,
ſaid I, is very well beſtowed on a
Widow, becauſe ſhee is forſaken
of the world; the holy Scripture
cals them mutes and tongueleſſe,
for ſo the Hebrew word ſignifies;
there is none that ſpeakes for
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1672:78"/>
her, and though ſhe take ſo much
courage as to ſpeake for her ſelfe,
yet none will heare her, ſo that
that imports as much alſo as if
ſhee were dumbe. Give mee leave
therefore I pray you to commiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the like misfortune, and to
mixe my teares with theſe wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens;
and wherefore, ſaid hee?
To what purpoſe is it that thou
knoweſt many things, if thou
doſt not make a right uſe of
them? Obſerve a little and thou
ſhalt ſee, how this Widow, that
ſeemes externally to have her
body made of <hi>Hoſanna's,</hi> and her
ſoule of <hi>Allelujahs;</hi> hath a ſable
ſhrowd, but greene heart. Seeſt
thou the obſcurity of this Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and thoſe vailes that cover
their faces; theſe are to diſguiſe
their teares, which are nought
but diſſembling. Wilt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1672:78"/>
them? let them alone: they
will revell as ſoone as they ſee no
body by them, that may ſerve as
a ſubject to exerciſe their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.
And then will the Goſſips
beginne their game; Come, come,
will one ſay, bee comforted, you
have an advantage, you dreame
not of; your husband hath left
you young, and there are brave
men enow, who will ſeeke after
and make very much of you. You
know partly already the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſuch a Gentleman, I am
confident that if he once obtaine
you, he will be ſo kinde, that you
will quickly forget the dead.
Faith, if I were in your place,
ſayes another, I would not bee
long pleaſing my ſelfe; for one
loſt, there is ten found: I would
practice the counſell my partner
gives you. But I thinke you are
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1672:79"/>
much obliged to him, that viſited
you yeſterday. What ſay you? Is
hee not an handſome man? yes
truly, and loves you extreamly.
Alacke, alacke, will the Widow
then anſwer, winking with her
eyes, and drawing her lips toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Tis not time yet to ſpeake
of that, all depends on Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
and he will ordaine it ſo,
if hee finde it neceſſary; yet your
counſell is not to bee neglected.
Doſt thou marke what extreame
griefe ſhee ſuffers? her husband is
but newly dead, and ſhee already
wel-nigh married. Conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with thy ſelfe, how vaine and
unprofitable theſe exclamations
are, which thou haſt made.</p>
            <p>Hee had hardly ended, when

hurly burly of people; and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1672:79"/>
and out of breath, crying out,
<hi>Aſſiſt the Kings Officers,</hi> and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
after a Debtour that fled
from him. The Common-wealth
is much beholding to this Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and ought very well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him, ſaid I, ſeeing he thruſts
his body into ſo great hazard, to
ſave their lives and goods. See
how hee is torne and bloudy, in
having employed his ſtrength
and power for the good and reſt
of it.</p>
            <p>Soft and faire, ſaid the aged
man, if I ſtop not your courſe
you will never leave; Sonne, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
thy ſelfe that he that is fled is
one of the Sergeants friends, with
whom hee often carrous'd; who
for not having made him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of a late booty hee had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
the Marſhall in ſpight would
arreſt, and caſt into priſon; but
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1672:80"/>
after he had broke from him, and
ſoundly beat him, hee is eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
as you ſee; and had need
to have good legges, ſeeing hee
runnes againſt thoſe, that are
ſwifter than race-horſes, where
they thinke to bee well paid. But
note, that it is not the leaſt
thought of the Weale publique
that puts him on this action, but
his private particular and malice
in being made a Novice. For I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
you, that if his owne intereſt
had not excited him to it, and
that hee had not ſought after him
in way of revenge, the Thiefe is
too much his Friend, and their
combination is too great for the
Law to take place. And though
ſuch as are decayed and in debt
are their chiefeſt gaine, yet their
revenues proceed from whips, the
rope, and the gibbet. Therefore I
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1672:80"/>
wonder why the World that
hates them ſo much, doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
to forſake vice and practice
vertue, (though but for a yeare
or two) to bee aveng'd and ſtarve
them. Tis a curſed office ſince
their wages are paid by <hi>Belzebub.</hi>

            <p>Hee had ſpoken more, if hee
had not beene deterred, by the

ſo ſwelled with pride, that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to bee heavier than the foure
horſes which drew him: hee ſate
as upright as if he had been a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and was very greedy in his
lookes, but ſo diſdainfull that
every one offended him: his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
on foot were many Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies,
and in the Coach a Jeaſter
and a Flatterer, who in obſcene
jeaſts, and itching talke, paſt away
the time. Happy art thou, ſaid I,

as ſoone as I ſaw him! without

All that thou thinkeſt and ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
(ſaid my Moderatour) is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſurmiſe, yet haſt thou
truly ſaid, that the World was
made for him, ſince it is nought
but vanity and folly, with which
hee is puffed up. I beleeve if thou
dive into his retinue, thou wilt
ſee more Creditours than Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
for his food and lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
proceed onely from loane,
credit, hope, and faire promiſes:
and if the ſecrets of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
were ript, the inventions,

her lips vilified Corall; her teeth
Pearle; and her hands Jeſſamine;
and in briefe ſhe was the Epitome
of earthly beatitude: and I my
ſelfe was more inflamed with a
deſire to follow her, than any
other object I had ſeene; but at
the very firſt ſtep my Guide
ſtayed mee, yet not without my
expreſſion of diſcontent in theſe
termes: hee muſt bee infinitely
barbarous, that is inſenſible of
the delicacy of ſo excellent a
beauty, as this is: how fortunate
is he who meets with ſo favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

what unknowne pleaſures is hee

is the maſter-peece of nature, and
the haven of all deſired wiſhes.
Till this preſent, ſaid my aged

the Rivers of liquid Chryſtall

I ſaw two wayes whoſe birth
came from one place, which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated

and little, till they were paſt a

compariſon can hardly be made,
and for being but litle frequented
was ſo full of brambles, thornes,

was a mighty toile to enter or

for they were faine
to leave both their money and

ſome paſſing, but their faces were
wanne and meager, and they wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
without ever looking backe:
to ſay that one might ride upon

that queſtion, a Traveller told
me, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was faine to

At which wondering, I appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

there were no Innes nor places of

alwayes goe, (ſaid he) there is no

for this is the way of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and but few paſſe through it.
Know you not that in the race of
life, to be borne is to ſet forth, to
live to pilgrim it; that the
Inne is the world, and in going
out of it there are not many
ſteppes, to enter either into paine
or glory. Saying this he went on,
God be with you, (ſaid hee) hee
that goes in the path of Vertue,

every ſtep, and the teares which
diſtilled from his eyes (in mine

ſoftened Flints, to be more plia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

was this way made (ſaid I)? It
is very rude and laborious, and to
make it more diſtaſtfull, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that goe in it are untractable
and uncivill. This agrees not
with mine humour; therefore I
left it, and turning on the left
hand got into the other; where I
ſaw much Company, many Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants,
and many Coaches full of
humane Beauties, whoſe eyes ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to contend with the Sunne;
ſome ſinging, others laughing,
and others eating, ſo that I tooke
it to be ſome great Feſtivall. And

my ſelfe in the midſt of the rout,
amongſt Ladies, Maſques, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
Playes, Banquets, very
conſonant to mine inclination.</p>
            <p>This was not like the other
tracke, where for want of Tai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
people went naked: there
were to ſpare here as well as of
Merchants, Skinners, Millaners,
Upholſters, and all Trades be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that ſerve to advance hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
pride, as Embroiderers,
Perfumers, Sadlers, Shoomakers,
Sempſters, Periwig-makers, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berdaſhers,
&amp;c. And for Inne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1672:89"/>
and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Vintners there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not abundance: with whom
I had not long beene, when I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſome of both wayes to
change, and ſhift from one to the
other, by very ſtrait by-pathes:
at whom wee all jeaſted, but
chiefely at thoſe that went from
us, calling them Diſſemblers, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,
wretched, and the refuſe of
the world; at which ſome of
them ſtopped their eares and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by, ſome ſtaid to heare us,
others were deafened with our
cries, and others flattered with
our perſwaſions revived.</p>
            <p>I ſaw alſo another middle way,
where many went, afarre off ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to bee vertuous, but nearer
hand were of our ſide. One told
me they were Church-hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
and were but onely vailed
and diſguiſed to us, for they had
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1672:89"/>
no Maskes, nor falſe Viſards for
the Eyes eternall. They went
alone, and were held to bee leſſe
ſubtle than Moores, and more
brute than lawleſſe Barbarians:
becauſe that they are contented to
enjoy the happines of the preſent
life, not knowing any other:
but theſe that can tell what tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
and eternall life is, are ſo
accurſed, that they neither free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enjoy the preſent, nor hope
for that to come. So that the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is to good purpoſe, that <hi>They
gaine Hell with a great deale of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,</hi>
that is, with much paines
taking. Here the Rich followed
riches, and the obſtinate went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
for they would not bee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by the more adviſed, but
ranne with all their might, and
got alwayes to be firſt. Magiſtrates
drew after them all litigious Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociators.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1672:90"/>
Paſſion and Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
allured bad Judges. And Kings
trained whole Common-wealths;
neither wanted there Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
men of all ſorts, and whole
Regiments of Souldiers, who
had beene truly glorious if they
had ſet forth the Name of God
in fighting, as they had done in
ſwearing. Some generous Spirits
of the number of thoſe who
were on the right hand, ſeeing
theſe wretches carrying yet paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports,
and petitions for reward
of their ſervice, cried unto them
moved with charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as if they
had gone to ſome battle, To mee
Souldiers, to me. What mean you?
Is it an action of valour to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
this way, for feare of the
dangers that are in it? Come on
boldly, for wee are aſſured that
thoſe that fight lawfully, ſhall
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1672:90"/>
be crowned: let not vaine hopes
of reward entice you: a worthy
man ought to ſeeke for nought
but vertue, and ſhee is the reward
of her ſelfe, if you rely upon
her: turne therefore and take
part with us, and you ſhall bee
happy. The Souldiers heard very
attentively all theſe perſwaſions,
and aſhamed of reproofe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardiſe
forſooke their Station,
and hanging downe their heads
caſt themſelves into a Taverne.</p>
            <p>After this I ſaw a great Lady,
without either Coach or Litter,
on foot and alone, and ſought
out a Scrivener to record it, being
no ordinary accident, but finding
none, I verily beleeved that I was
not miſtaken; yet calling to
minde that I had heard that the
way to Paradiſe was full of croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
auſterity and repentance, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1672:91"/>
conſidering that I ſaw not any
about mee, but ſuch as diſcourſed
of wantonneſſe and delight, I
beganne to queſtion and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt;
but I was drawne from
this incertainty, by a multitude
of married men, who led their
wives by their hands, that people
might take notice of their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
nevertheles ſome of them were
their husbands faſt, ſince he dicted
himſelfe that ſhee might feed on
dainties; and others his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
ſince hee grudged his owne
apparell to maintaine her in her
Coach, and to buy toyes, gownes,
and ſuperfluous trifles for her:
by which I learnt, that a man ill
married, may boaſt that hee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes
in the perſon of his wife, all
neceſſary qualities to bee put in
the liſt of Martyrs: and ſeeing
their troubleſome life, confirmed
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1672:91"/>
my firſt faith, that I was in the
good way: but that opinion had
no long durance, becauſe I heard
a voyce behinde me crying, Make
way there for Apparatours; O
God! ſaid I, Are there Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours
here? Without doubt wee
are going to Hell; and it was
true, for at the ſame inſtant wee
were got in by a little Doore
made like a Mouſetrap, eaſie to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but impoſſible to get out.</p>
            <p>I was greatly aſtoniſhed, in that
in all the way no man remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
whither hee was going, and
yet when wee were entred, every
one agaſt beganne to looke upon
his Companion, ſaying, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible,
we are in Hell. At which
mine heart beganne to quiver,
and with teares in mine eyes, I
beganne to bewaile thoſe I had
left behinde mee in the World,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1672:92"/>
as my Kindred, Friends, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance:
but turning my face
towards the way by which wee
came, I ſaw moſt of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
whoſe arrivall did a little
comfort mee, beleeving that
they would bee ſome conſolation
in ſo ſad an abode, if perhaps I
ſhould ſtay there long.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding I purſued
my journey, and noted the Gate
to bee guarded by ſeaven Divels,
who kept account of all that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.
They asked my name and
quality, and knowing my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
let mee paſſe; but deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the throng behinde mee
the ſame queſtion, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Tailours, one of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
anſwered, What a ſtrange
thing is this? I thinke that all
the Tailours in the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,
that Hell is made for none
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1672:92"/>
but them, they come in ſuch clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
How many are there, ſaid
another Divell? There are an
hundred, ſaid the former: De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
not your ſelfe, ſaid his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
It is impoſſible if they be
Tailours there ſhould bee ſo few,
for the leaſt band that comes day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of them, is not leſſe than a
thouſand or twelve hundred, and
we have already ſo many, that we
know not where to pile them,
neither know I whether we ought
to receive them or no: the poore
Smell-feaſts were much frighted
at theſe words, beleeving they
would thruſt them out; but at laſt
they found favour and got in. I
may well ſay (thought I then)
that theſe people are very wicked,
ſince the refuſall of entrance into
Hell is ſo rigorous a threatning
to them. Hereupon behold a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1672:93"/>
of the Blacke Guard, who
ſtackt them up in a place of ſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
they being by reaſon of their
dry ſeeding accounted the wood
of Hell.</p>
            <p>From the Gate going through
a darke entry, one called mee by
my name; at which horrour
ſtrucke I turned, and perceived it
to bee a man, yet very hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the darkneſſe which was
very thicke, and the flames that
environed him. Ah, Sir! ſaid he,
Doe you not know me? I am ſuch
an one, a Bookeſeller; Is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſaid I? Yes, anſwered hee,
'tis I; Who would ever have
thought it? Hee beleeved that I
would have pitied him; but when
I had ſeene his face, I beganne to
admire the righteous judgement
of God in his juſt puniſhment,
for his Shop was a very Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1672:93"/>
of Sedition; and it was he
that ſold and vented all thoſe
wicked, ſcandalous, and ſchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
Pamphlets, againſt
Church and State Government,
which at this day runne up and
downe under the hands of male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent,
diſaffected perſons: and
ſomewhat neare him, I alſo eſpied
another, whoſe Shop had beene
no other than a Stewes of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionſneſſe,
and a Magazine of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies,
fraught with nothing more
than obſcene, ſcurrilous, prophane,
railing, &amp; popiſh Pamphlets, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the ſubverſion of all good
maners, &amp; to the encreaſe of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
vanities. After that I had
a while beheld them, I made ſhew
of adminiſtring redres unto them,
but they perceiving that I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited,
ſaid, What would you?
tis the curſednes of our condition,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1672:94"/>
that wee are not condemned for
our owne workes onely, as other
men are, but endure and ſuffer for
the workes of others; yet herein
we receive ſome ſolace, in that we
are not alone, but have Printers
our coequals, who for their owne
lucre, have been as forward as our
ſelves in theſe things; and for
ought wee ſee, ſuffer more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
than our ſelves, and that
for nothing more than for their
unjuſt and unconſcionable dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
towards us, in often prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſuch great numbers of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus
bookes to their owne abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
benefit, and our great loſſe
and detriment. More they would
have ſaid, but that a Divell with
the ſmoake of his looſe paper,
ſtopped their breath; to avoid
which fume I went on, ſaying in
my ſelfe, Alas! If there are men
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1672:94"/>
condemned for ſelling and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the evill workes of others,
what ſhall become of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and thoſe that practice
them?</p>
            <p>I paſſed on, and went into a
Cave, where I ſaw many burning
in immortall Fire. One of them
ſaid I, I never overſold, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſold but that which was
juſt, why am I thus afflicted?
When I heard him ſay he had ſold
that which was juſt, I thought
it had beene <hi>Iudas,</hi> and went nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to ſee if hee were red haird, as
wee commonly imagine: but I
found it to be a Mercer, dead not
long before. How, World-thrive
(ſaid I) are you here? he ſcorned
to anſwer, becauſe I gave him no
better Title: but one of their
Torturers (to augment their
paine) Theſe Drapers, Mercers,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1672:95"/>
Goldſmiths, and Silkemen (ſaid
hee) would alwayes ſhape their
falſe lights and waights accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their fancy, and make
their meaſures of what length
and ſhortneſſe they pleaſed, and
now they finde the gaine on't.
But if the World would be wiſe,
they would quickly banquerupt
all theſe kinde of men; for then
they would underſtand, that
Stuffes of Gold and Silver, and
Silke that Plate, Diamonds, and
Pearle, that Lace, Silke, and
Cloath, and all other things up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which they ſet unmercifull
rates, are things rather ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than neceſſary, and that theſe
are they that feed all your diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
and fooliſh expences, to
which they allure and flatter you
with a Lover called Credit, by
meanes whereof they inviſibly
ruine you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:1672:95"/>
The Divell would have ſpoke
more if I had not left him, to ſee
from whence proceeded thoſe
peales of laughter, which I heard.
They were Spirits deriding one,
who would not ſubmit becauſe
he was a Gentleman, ſhewing his
Pedigree taken from the Heralds
Office; but a Divell told him,
Gentleman (ſaid he) let your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
bee what it will, you have
not done in your life time any
other, than the works of an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
man, in ſwearing, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and haunting of Brothell-houſes,
and Tavernes; in which
reſpect, your Armes are diſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the Court of Hell. Hee
that is vertuous, is the truly No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
yet though a man were an
upſtart, (as you are) if his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were worthy imitation, wee
dare no more touch him than a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:1672:96"/>
thing ſacred. Your billetting
would not have been made here,
if you had bin better than others:
but ſince you eſteeme your ſelfe ſo
noble, you ſhall be burnt that we
may preſerve your aſhes: this
ſaid, he caſt him into a furnace.</p>
            <p>Taking the left hand, I ſaw a
number of old men, tearing their
fleſh, and lamenting bitterly, and
inquiring what they were? This
is the Incloſure, ſaid one, of thoſe
Fathers, who damne themſelves
that their Poſterity may bee rich,
and who otherwiſe are called the
ill-adviſed. Miſerable that I am!
(ſaid one of them) I never had in
all my life time ſo much as one
minutes reſt, I did not eate, ſlept
not, and went almoſt naked, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
both my body and
minde to gather ſubſtance, that I
might richly marry my Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1672:96"/>
and with great ſummes pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
them Offices and honours:
which done I died without being
ſicke, that I might diminiſh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of thoſe golden heapes, I
had gathered together; and yet
the breath was ſcarce out of my
body, but they quite forgot mee;
no teares, no monrning, and as if
they had had certaine intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of my damnation, they
neither charitably wiſh me a joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
reſurrection, nor accompliſh
that which I commanded them;
nay more, to aggravate my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
God ſuffers that I ſee them
from hence conſume and ſpend
in diſſoluteneſſe, thoſe goods for
which I have ſo impoveriſhed the
World. Tis no time now to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
ſaid a Divell, Have you
not heard being on Earth this
Proverbe, <hi>Happy is the Childs
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1672:97"/>
whoſe Father goes to the Divell?</hi>
At this the poore men multiplied
their cries, which object moved
me to ſo great compaſſion, that I
could no more behold them.</p>
            <p>But a little farther eſpying an
obſcure Dungeon, in which was
heard a great jangling and clatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of chaines; I asked what
place that was? and was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
it was the bounds of <hi>O that I
had!</hi> I underſtand you not, ſaid I,
what are they? Theſe are (ſaid
one) the Ideots of the World,
who gave themſelves over to
vice, to their inſenſible damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and now remembring what
they ſhould have done, and
did not; to defend themſelves
from the paines they ſuffer, they
continually cry, <hi>O that I had</hi>
confeſſed my ſinnes to the Lord!
<hi>O that I had repented! O that I
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:1672:97"/>
had</hi> gone to Church! <hi>O that I
had</hi> ſerved God! <hi>O that I had</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved
the poore! <hi>O that I had</hi>
refrained my tongue, and many
other exclamations like unto
theſe.</p>
            <p>After theſe late Repentants, I
met others farre worſe, who were
in a baſeCourt full of much naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;
and wondered to heare the
title that belonged to them, which
was as a Divell told mee, God is
mercifull, and will <hi>forgive.</hi> How
can that bee, ſaid I, that mercy
ſhould condemne, ſince that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
is an action of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice?
You talke like a Divell.
And you ſaid the Divell, like a
Foole, ſince you know not that
halfe of thoſe that are here are
adjudged by Gods mercy. But,
to make you underſtand the Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Conſider how many Sinners
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:1672:98"/>
there are, who when they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed
of their evill doings,
leave not for all that to continue
and increaſe them more and more,
in anſwering to their Reprovers,
<hi>God is mercifull, hee regards not ſo
ſmall a thing, his mercy is ſo great:</hi>
and thus whileſt they hope in
God, perſevering in their wicked
wayes, wee never diſtruſt them.
After your reckoning, (ſaid I)
none may rely on the Mercy of
God. You are dull, ſaid hee, you
muſt truſt in it, 'tis that that
helpes forward good deſires, and
rewards good actions, but it is
denied to thoſe that are obſtinate
in their wicked wayes, for it is to
play with Grace, to beleeve that
it ſerves to cover guilt, and to
thinke that a man may receive
it juſt when hee hath need of it
without ever endeavoring to get
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1672:98"/>
it. Gods mercy is infinite for his
Saints and repentant Sinners,
who ſtruggle to become worthy;
and thoſe that have the greateſt
ſhare, are ſuch as are moſt fearfull;
but hee that knowes how great it
is, makes himſelfe unworthy the
effects, when he turnes it into the
liberty of evill doing, and not
into ſpirituall profit.</p>
            <p>Can it be (ſaid I overwhelmed
with marvell) that ſo good a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſhould proceed from the
mouth of ſo miſchievous a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour?
Which ſpoken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Divell
ſhewed mee a flaming partition,
wherein (as one of the Tortured
told me) were thoſe that were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with ſuddaine deaths. You
lye, (in reverence bee it ſpoken to
the Gentleman that heares mee)
ſaid the Fiend, no man dies ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly.
Death uſes no ſurprize.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1672:99"/>
There wants never warning. How
is it that you complaine of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuddenly, when ſince your
very birth, ſince you beganne the
courſe of your life, Death was
alwayes with you? What is more
ordinarily ſeene in the World
than dying and buriall? What is
ſpoken of more in the Pulpit?
or read of more in good Bookes,
than the frailty of life, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of Death? Firſt of all the
body, growes it not every day
nearer and nearer to its Tombe?
Cloathes, weare they not? Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
decay they not? Your owne
Diſeaſes, and thoſe of others,
knocke they not at all houres at
the Gates of your Soules, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
them that they muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge?
Sleepe, repreſents it not
to the life the death of living
man? and life, is it not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1672:99"/>
by the death of beaſts?
And for all this, you are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent,
as to ſay that you dyed
ſuddenly. No, no, change lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
ſay hereafter that you are
unbeleevers, dead, without ever
thinking that you ſhould dye;
and learne beſides, that Death
takes as ſoone the youngeſt ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
as the agedſt decrepite; and
according to what they have
done, be it good or ill, ſhe proves
either a Mother or a Stepdame.</p>
            <p>He ſhewed me alſo a vaſt Caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
ſavouring of many oily
ſents, wherein were preſerved
Apothecaries, Comfit-makers,
Chirurgions, Diſtillers, Barbers,
and Mountebankes, with many
more, for feare of rottenneſſe,
ſaying, theſe are the true Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,
and not <hi>Geber, Ruspicella,</hi>
with the reſt; becauſe they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1672:100"/>
writ of what metals Gold
might bee made, but made it not;
or if they did, none ever ſince
could penetrate into the depth of
their ſecrets. But theſe, out of
puddle water, ſtickes, Flies, dung,
Vipers, Toads, ſimples, ſugar and
excrements, can make Gold, of
better ſubſtance than all thoſe
could, that ever medled in the
art, becauſe that theirs is ready
coined for uſe. In which reſpect
wee are carefull to preſerve them,
leaſt our treaſure ſhould decreaſe.</p>
            <p>Hereupon another Divell made
ſignes that I ſhould come unto
him without noiſe; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
done, hee ſet mee againſt an
open caſement, ſaying, looke in
there, and ſee the ordinary exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of fowle Women. I did as I
was commanded, and beheld a
very great number, ſome whereof
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1672:100"/>
were putting blacke patches on
their faces; others pluckt up the
haire on their eyebrowes, and
others that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had none made uſe of
blacke Lead, ſome put on fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops
of counterfeit haire, ſome
placed Ivory teeth in their
gummes, in ſtead of thoſe of Ebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
which were fallen out. This
eate Ambergreece Comfits to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
her breath, and thoſe held
boxes of painting, with which
they daubed their faces, and by
this meanes became infinitely ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
without being either Starres
or Sunnes. Well, ſaid the Divell,
would you have beleeved that
Women had been ſo inventive and
ingenious to perdition? I knew
not what to anſwer, but turned
away, and ſaw a man ſitting on a
Chaire all alone, without either
fire, ice, Divell, or racke about
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1672:101"/>
him; who nevertheleſſe cried out
with the fearfulleſt cries that ever
I yet heard; his heart t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ickled

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt, and gnawed
his armes, in ſo furious a manner,
that I thought he had been mad;
O Lord! ſaid I, with what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire
is this poore man tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
no body to my thinking
doth him any harme; Friend,
my Friend, What Fury bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
you? For what doe you
complaine being here alone, free
from all manner of Torture.
Alas! ſaid hee, with a terrible
voice, I feele in my ſelfe all the
pangs of Hell together. You ſee
not the Hangmen that are linkt
to my Soule; you ſee them not
(ſaid hee, reiterating his cry, and
turning about as diſtracted) but
hee ſees them, whoſe ſevere and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1672:101"/>
implacable Juſtice can meaſure
offences, with torments without
meaſure. O Memory! thou art to
mee a cruell Divell! memory of
the good I might have done, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of thoſe wholeſome coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
I have deſpiſed, and the evils
I have committed, Ah! that thou
doſt afflict me! And to heape up
my misfortunes, when thou lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
me, my Reaſon beginnes her
courſe, and the imagination of
that glory I might have had, and
that others poſſeſſe, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
bought it ſo deare, as I have
done the paines I ſuffer! O under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding!
What cruelty doſt

               </gap> uſe towards mee, in ſetting
before me Heaven and Paradiſe, ſo
full of beauty, joy, content, and
delight, and yet drowneſt mee
more and more in deſpaire!
Some releaſe I pray thee. And
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1672:102"/>
thou my Will, Is it poſſible that
thou reſuſeſt to make a truce for
one poore moment? You that
are a Pilgrim of the other World,
who aske what torments mee?
Know they are the three powers
of my Soule, converted into invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
flames, and into three Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners,
who without hand or
Element, burne and teare my En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals.
And if by chance they
ceaſe to wracke mee, the Worme
of Conſcience gnawes my Soule,
as the perpetuall food of inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hunger. Ending this word, he
caſt forth a deepe groane, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
from me; Mortail, ſaid he,
Conſider that thoſe of the
World, who were illuminated
with the Goſpell, and endowed
with celeſtiall Graces, and have
not employed them to their
owne Salvation, carry their Hell
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1672:102"/>
in themſelves, and are tormented
with the like miſery as I am.
This ſaid, hee beganne his firſt
worke: and I departed very pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,
apprehending in my ſelfe,
that that man muſt needs have
heavy crimes upon his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
But the Divell ſeeing mee
ſad, whiſpered in mine eare that
it was an Atheiſt, who neither
beleeved in God nor the Divell.
O that an underſtanding man is
really accurſed (replied I) when
he cannot tell how to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of that Talent, which God
hath given him!</p>
            <p>Not farre off, I ſaw abundance
of People, drawing a fiery Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot
through a burning Lake,
with rings thruſt through their
tongues, to which the harneſſe
was faſtened; and a Divell going
before them with this Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1672:103"/>
               <hi>This is the puniſhment of
ſwearers, ſlanderers, and lyers.</hi> In
the Waggon were eaſie beleevers;
and in a roome whoſe proſpect
looked upon them were beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Women, tormented in quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Witches; at which mine
heart melted, but a Divell came
to comfort mee, ſaying, Doe you
not remember the evill they have
done you? Have you not often
found by experience, that they
uſe a certaine kinde of Magicke
that deſtroyes; therefore their
paine is agreeable to it.</p>
            <p>I followed my devilliſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductour,
and ſaw <hi>Judas</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied

               </hi>
ſeemed to bee well pleaſed with
them, who related the exploits
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1672:103"/>
they had done in his imitation.
Going nearer, I ſaw that their
torment was like that of <hi>Titius,</hi>
on whoſe entrals a Vultur ſtill
gnawed, for their Conſciences
were their greateſt Tormentours.
I could not ſuppreſſe the deſire I
had to ſpeake, perjured, diſloyall,
traitour, villaine above all exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(ſaid I) how durſt thou bee ſo
vile, as to ſell thy Maſter, thy
Lord, and thy God? Why, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<hi>Judas,</hi> doe you complaine
of that? You ſhould rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
than condemne mee, ſince
you receive ſo great a benefit
thereby. Tis for mee to bewaile
that am excluded from the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of ſo great a good, as I
have put into your hands. But
thinke not that I am <hi>Iudas</hi> alone,
Know that ſince the Lords Death
there have beene and are worſe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1672:104"/>
than I, more wicked, and more
unthankfull, witneſſe Heretickes,
and Schiſmatickes. For if I did
once ſell my Maſter, I was in part
cauſe of the Redemption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde;
but they in ſelling him,
you, and themſelves, have loſt all
the World. And others, who are
not content to ſell him onely, but
they ſcourge, and crucifie him,
more ignominiouſly than the
Jewes, in their wicked lives. And
though I know that repentance
now availes mee not, yet I would
have you on earth to looke into
yourſelves before you cenſure me;
ſince I was the firſt Steward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for ſale, and not for bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,
as is the uſe and practice of
all my fellowes.</p>
            <p>I would heare no more, but
making way, ſaw a great bulke of
building which ſeemed like ſome
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1672:104"/>
inchanted Caſtle; in which were
many Venereous Divels toſſing
Whores and Thieves from ſcal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
oyle into frozen ice, to heate
and coole their appetite. One of
the Females ſtepping to the thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold,
where I and my Guide
ſtood, Gentlemen (ſaid ſhee) I
pray you tell us whether this bee
juſtice to condemne People both
for giving and taking? A Thiefe
is condemned becauſe hee takes
from another, and an Whore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhee gives. For my part, I
maintaine that there is no inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
in us; for if it be juſtice for
every one to give of his owne,
and that we doe no other, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are we damned? Wee found
her queſtion too difficult to bee
derided, and therefore ſent her
to Lawyers and Counſellours,
who were not farre from her:
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:1672:105"/>
but remembring that I had heard
her ſpeake of Thieves, I asked
where Seriveners were, becauſe as
I came, I overtook none by the
way: I beleeve, ſaid my Divell,
that you met not any. Why? Are
they then allſaved? No, ſaid he,
but they come neither on foot
nor horſebacke, but flying on
wings a million in a flocke; in
reſpect of which lightneſſe, they
are tormented in an upper Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>I paſt by, and not farre from
thence went unto a place, in
which many Soules were ſhut up,
ſome whereof were very ſilent,
and others clamorous. One told
me it was the empalement of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
at which I was ſomething
grieved, ſeeing that Death doth
not kill the ſighes with the body.
Some talked of their paſſions,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1672:105"/>
and endured a torment of loving
diſtruſt, and others attributed their
loſſe to their deſires and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
wherof the force of the one,
and, the colours of the other, did
preſent pictures to bee a thouſand
times fairer than perſons and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
The moſt part-of them
were diſquieted and moleſted
with a torture called <hi>I thought.</hi>
(as a Divell <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>old me) and asking
what that was? Hee ſmiling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
'tis a torment agreeable to
their offence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for when Lovers
ſee themſelves deceived in their
hopes, either in the purſuit or
poſſeſſion of their Miſtreſſes,
they ſay alwayes, <hi>I thought</hi> that
ſhee did love mee, <hi>I thought</hi> ſhee
would have beene the raiſing of
my fortune, <hi>I thought</hi> that ſhee
would have been faithfull to me;
ſo that the cauſe of their <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:1672:106"/>
proceeds not from any other
thing but <hi>I thought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next to Lovers were Poets,
who endured the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe their paſſions were
not much different. Theſe men
are of very jeaſting humours,
(ſaid the Divell) for whileſt that
others mourne and bewaile their
ſins, they ſing theirs, and publiſh
them every where. For if they
have but once laine with a <hi>Cloris,
Phillis, Silviae,</hi> or <hi>Melita,</hi> by the
meanes of one ſong they will
walke her through a kingdome
dockt like a Chimiſticall God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe.
They will give her golden
haire, a Chryſtall forehead, eyes
of Emralds or Diamonds, teeth
of Pearle, lippes of Purple and
Rubies, with words of Muske
and Amber: and yet for all theſe
riches of which they are ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:1672:106"/>
they cannot get credit for
a meane ſute among Brokers, a
courſe ſhirt among Sempſters, nor
a crackt beaver at the ſecond
hand.</p>
            <p>Fearing too long a ſtay, I went
on to ſee the devout Impertinents,
who make prayers and requeſts
to God full of abſurd extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies.
O that they gave teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of much griefe! Their
tongues were chained in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
ſilence, and their bodies
made crooked and bending to the
Earth, condemned to heare for
ever the fearfull cries of a whea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
Divell, who thus reproved
them. You brazen-fac't abuſers
of Prayer, and the long ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of GOD, preſumptuous,
who dare treat with the Divine
Majeſty, with leſſe reſpect than
you would doe with a Merchant
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1672:107"/>
with whom you traffique: how
many times have you made theſe
execrable petitions? Lord, take
my Father out of this World,
that I may enjoy his goods. Let
my Brother die within few dayes
that I may ſucceed him in digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Grant that I may finde a
Mine of Gold at my feet. That I
may bee fortunate in play. That
my Sonne and Daughter may be
richly married. That the King
may caſt his favour upon me. And
adde unto theſe raſh demands;
Doe this Lord, and I promiſe to
give money towards the marriage
of Orphants, to build Almeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes,
and relieve Hoſpitals.
What blindneſſe! to promiſe gifts
to him, from whom you deſire
riches, and to whom all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long?
What arrogancy! to require
of God in quality of favors thoſe
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1672:107"/>
things, which he gives ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for puniſhments and chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and although you doe
obtaine, yet you never performe
your promiſes. How many prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations
have you made to God,
his members, and his ſervice, when
you were in the abyſſe of raging
and tempeſtuous neceſſity, on
land, at ſea, in ſickneſſe, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire,
of which you have held
no reckoning when you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
your wiſhes. But you were
never other than Hypocrites and
deceivers. Your oathes and vowes
were never made through devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but neceſſity. Did you ever
aske of God your Soules reſt? the
increaſe of Grace, his favours,
and inſpirations? No verily, and
I beleeve you were altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the worth of theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
riches, thinking too much
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:1672:108"/>
on temporall; and knew not that
the moſt pleaſing ſacrifices and
oblations to GOD, were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Conſcience, humility of
ſpirit, and ſervent love and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Hee takes delight that men
ſhould be mindefull of him, that
he may multiply his benefits, but
they never remember him, but
when they feele affliction, and
that is the reaſon God ſends them
calamities, to maintaine their
zeale. Unjuſt demanders! Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
now how little thoſe things
you have deſired, and God given,
have ſtaid with you: and how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull
they have bin, (though
you have ever cheriſht them)
ſince they have not accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
you to your laſt end. Conſider
that your Children and Kindred
doe ſo little remember what
goods you have left them, that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1672:108"/>
they employ not one penny to
pious uſes, yet they are excuſable,
in that ſeeing that you did none
in your life time, they know you
cannot take pleaſure in them
though performed after your
death: and beſides that you are
in a place which they truſt never
to deſerve. Some of theſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men would have anſwered,
but the muzzles that lockt up
their ſpeech would not permit
them.</p>
            <p>Thence I went into a great
Hall, ſmelling abundantly of
Sulphur; wherein were <hi>Alchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi>
whom Divels examined
with much trouble, for they
could not underſtand their gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge:
their talke was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of metallicke Subſtances,
which they named after the ſeven
Planets, as Gold the Sunne, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1672:109"/>
the Moone, Braſſe <hi>Iupiter,</hi>
Tinne <hi>Venus,</hi> &amp;c. They were all
charged with furnaces, cruſibles,
coales, bellowes, argall, minerals,
dungs, mans bloud, and alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicke
powders; ſome calcined,
others waſht <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here they purified,
there ſeparated, made firme that
which was volatile, rarified and
converted into fume, that
which was firme: in another
place they tranſmuted formes,
and fixed <hi>Mercury;</hi> then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
reſolved the viſcous matter,
exiled the ſubtle part, and fire
corruptible, when they came to
the coppell all exhaled in vapour:
ſome diſputed whether the fire
was to be made of Beech or Maple?
whether or no the fire of <hi>Raimun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
Lullius</hi> was to bee underſtood
of lime, or of the effective light of
heat, and not the effective heat of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1672:109"/>
fire? Others with <hi>Hermes</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne,
gave the principle to the
great worke. Others looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the blacke become white, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
to ſee it red. And whileſt
that the proportion of nature
with nature, did contend and
aide it ſelfe; whileſt that the reſt
of their blinde Oracles did waite
the reduction of the firſt matter;
in lieu of converting dung into
haire, and humane bloud, ingots,
and wedges of Gold; they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
fine Gold into fine ordure,
became fooles, beggars, and falſe
Coiners: how often did I heare
them ſay, <hi>The Dead Father is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen,
kill him once more!</hi> How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
did I ſee buſied to explain theſe
words, ſo often repeated by al Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt
authours, <hi>God be praiſed, who
ſuffers that out of the vileſt thing
in the world, ſo excellent and rich
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1672:110"/>
a matter ſhould bee made!</hi> Some
ſaid they had found the ſenſe,
and that if the Philoſophers
Stone was to be made of the vileſt
thing in the World, it was to bee
made of publike Strumpets, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there is nothing ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in Nature, as to proſtitute
ones body to all commers; upon
this opinion they went to boile
and diſtill them; but a Divell
came, ſaying, Gentlemen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
will you know aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
what is the vileſt thing in the
World? It is <hi>Alchimiſts,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
deſiring to make the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
Stone, following the
method wee heard you talke on;
wee will put you into the fire to
make an experimentall proofe.
As hee ſaid, ſo twas done, and the
poore mad Chimiſts burned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
with their owne wils, ſo
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1672:110"/>
great a deſire they had to ſee the
Elixir:</p>
            <p>Not farre off from theſe, I ſaw
a great ſociety of Aſtrologers,
and ſuperſtitious men. One of
them who was a Fortune-teller,
looked upon the hands of all the
condemned, ſaying, it is very eaſie
to know by the Mount of <hi>Saturne,</hi>
that you were to bee damned;
and as eaſily to bee diſtinguiſhed
by this girdle of <hi>Venus,</hi> that you
are all lechers. Another who was
encompaſt with Spheres, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
the Starres, riſing up
cried out, O God! What misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
If my Mother had but been
delivered of mee one halfe houre
ſooner, I had beene ſaved; for at
that inſtant <hi>Saturne</hi> changed
aſpect, and <hi>Mars</hi> lodged in the
houſe of life. Another ſaid to the
Divels that tormented him, that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1672:111"/>
they were beſt to bee aſſured that
he was dead, for his part he would
not beleeve it, becauſe he had <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>
for aſcendant, and <hi>Venus</hi> in
the houſe of life, not having any
evill aſpect; which ſignified that
hee ſhould live, an hundred and
one yeares, two moneths, ſixe
dayes, foure houres, and three
minutes. And another reduced his
Science into certaine heads, to
divine of things to come, and
know things paſt; yet could not
gueſſe at the time that was now
preſent, nor of his owne and his
Companies damnation. Beſides
theſe there were many Magicians,
Negromancers, Sorcereſſes, and
Inchanters in the ſame ſtation;
and many places of expectation
void, which were ſaid to be kept
for certaine great men, who added
faith to theſe devilliſh. Diſciples.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:1672:111"/>
At laſt I beganne to bee very
weary, and looked about to ſee if
I could finde any place to get
out; which ſtriving to doe, I was
(before I was aware) in a long
Gallery, in which was <hi>Lucifer</hi>
Prince of Hell, environed with
his whole Court compoſed of he
and ſhe Divels; for there are Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males
as well as Males: but fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to faile in reſpect and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
his horrible countenance alſo
frighting mee, I ſtaid at the entry
thereof; when the Uſher of the
Chamber came and told me, that
being a Stranger, his Prince had
commanded him to bring me in,
and ſhew mee all the rarities. I
thanked him for the honour his
Maſter did me and for the paines
hee tooke himſelfe; and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,
beganne to conſider
how the place was better ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1672:112"/>
than thoſe are of our greateſt
Lords and Potentates, though
the moſt curious in the World:
for they have nought but dead
Statues, or painted pictures,
dumbe, inſenſible, immoveable;
but here all the perſons were ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
with breathing and life:
and which was moſt rare, were
of no baſe condition. None but
Emperours and Kings, ſome <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman,</hi>
ſome Roman, ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
beſides many Queenes,
Princes, and Princeſſes, who
would binde mee to too long a
deſcription in nomination. But
for as much as I was not able any
longer to endure the aire of this
hot Climate, I intreated the
Fiend to ſhew mee which way
I might get out. Yes, ſaid he, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me. And then he ſhewed mee
a paſſage, through which I got
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1672:112"/>
into the ſame Vale I mentioned
at the beginning of this wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
diſcourſe; trembling and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
both together, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating
on the divers puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
many were tormented
with, who perhaps had leſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
them than I my ſelfe;
which made me undertake a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
purpoſe, to live for the time
to come in ſuch ſort, that I may
avoid feeling the reality and
truth of thoſe torments, which I
beheld now onely in viſion. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
thee Reader to make thy

that thou maiſt need no further
