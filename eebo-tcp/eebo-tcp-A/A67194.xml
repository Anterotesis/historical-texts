            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>From the whole Verse, there are some of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Rabbins have been curious in observations, (for they were strangely given that way, as appeares by all their writings) some of their conceits were thus:</p>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which is as much, in number, as M. with us. That because in this Verse it is six times exprest, that is, once in six of the words: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> (<hi>hash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamajim</hi>) only wants it, that therefore this world is to continue from the creation 6000 years, And some since have called the seventh of the thousands, the eternall rest, and therefore consealed; in the mystery of <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is not found.</p>
               <p>And a second observation is from the number of these seven words, that they hold forth unto us the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven dayes in the week, in six of which God created the world, and we are appointed to labour, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth which is the Heavens, doth signifie the day of rest.</p>
               <p>But leaving the Rabbins to their curiosities, I will conclude at this time, with this undeniable truth: <hi>That in beginning, God, who is Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity, created the heavens, and the Earth in the first forme thereof, of nothing; and this Heaven and Earth thus first made was the world, though not yet set in perfect order, but afterward beautified by the Ornaments of the six daies work.</hi>

                  <item>1 I will begin with <hi>Austin,</hi> he thought it was a <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall,</hi> and no naturall, or corporeall <hi>light</hi>; but that cannot be, because it did distinguish day and night.</item>
                  <item>2 <hi>Catharinus,</hi> and others, conceived it to be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect light of the <hi>Sun,</hi> now made this first day, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed againe the fourth day; but that is directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Text of the Scripture in verse 16. where it is expresly said, <hi>That God made the Sun, as also the Moon and Stars.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3 <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> and so <hi>Theodoret</hi> say, that it was such a <hi>bright cloud,</hi> that no mortall nature could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to look upon it whilst it was whole, and that therefore it was afterwards dispersed into severall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Sun, Moon, and Stars: But that is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable; for then the most absolute glory of the whole Creation should have lost its perfection, before man was created.</item>
                  <item>4 <hi>Damascene</hi> supposed, that this light proceeded from the <hi>element of fire</hi>; but that cannot be, for the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of fire was not (as yet) created.</item>

                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:107491:15"/>5 <hi>Basil,</hi> and others, hold it to be a <hi>light without a subject,</hi> afterwards fastened to the body of the Sun: Indeed if it had beene <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>(or) a body of light,</hi> that appears a clear mistake.</item>
                  <item>6 <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi> relates this light to be the <hi>Sun,</hi> but as yet imperfect, and afterwards beautified, and finished. If he had onely said it had been such a light, and not called it the <hi>Sun,</hi> his relation had been more probable.</item>
                  <item>7 <hi>Beda, Lyranus,</hi> the <hi>Master of sentences,</hi> and others, alleadge it to be a <hi>bright lightsome cloud,</hi> which was carried about by a circular motion, and gave light to the world, and indeed this is something to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: But,</item>
                  <item>8 Others, together with those quoted by <hi>Piscator,</hi> say, that this light was <hi>a little cloud that had a glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering light in it,</hi> brought out of those waters, where the Spirit of God moved, and that by the power of the Almighty, it was caused to move with a circular motion about the masse of waters, and Chaos; and this seems to be most probable, and agreeing with the whole History.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And yet some goe a step further, and say, that this little light was afterwards translated into the body of the Sun, on the fourth day when it was created; but that is an extream curiosity.</p>
