         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

an <hi>arming sword,</hi> not of War, but of Justice, to cut off Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
and Idolatry on the one side, and Profanenesse and
Sacriledge on the other: Heretiques with one edge, and
Schismatiques with the other. For as in the beginning of
the Reformation, so now in the endeavoured perfection
thereof, the mortall enemie of our immortall soules sets on
work all sorts of Heretiques and Schismatiques to hinder, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe,
and (if it were possible) destroy this <hi>excellent work.</hi>
The Heretiques he employeth to <hi>pervert</hi> the Catholique
doctrine, the Schismatiques to <hi>subvert</hi> the Apostolike disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Church: the Heretiques endeavour to shake the
foundations, the Schismatiques to make breaches in the
walls: the Heretiques to rot the maine timber, the Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiques
to pull in sunder the rafters of this sacred stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</p>
            <p>Now of all Heretiques and Schismatiques the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist
in three regards ought to be most carefully looked unto,
and severely punished, if not utterly exterminated and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
out of the Church and Kingdome.</p>
            <p>First, In regard of their affinity with many other damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Heretiques, both Ancient and Later; for they are <hi>allyed</hi>
unto, and may <hi>claime kindred with,</hi> 1. The <hi>Millenarians</hi> in
the first Age, proclaiming Christs Temporal Kingdome up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
earth for a thousand yeares, before the day of Judgment.
2. With the <hi>Marcionites</hi> in the second Age, who denyed the
substance of Christs humane body <hi>made of a woman.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 4.</note> 3. The
<hi>Catharists</hi> or <hi>Novatians</hi> in the third Age, who denyed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and restitution to the Church thereupon, to those that
fell in time of persecution. 4. With the <hi>Donatists</hi> in the
fourth Age, who re-baptized all those that had received
Baptisme before in the Catholique Church. Lastly, with
<pb facs="tcp:60443:4"/>
a rabble of Heretiques in the latter Ages, namely, the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolici,</hi>
the <hi>Adamites,</hi> the <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> the <hi>Psycopannychists,</hi> the
<hi>Polygamists,</hi> the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> the <hi>Arminians,</hi> and the <hi>Brownists;</hi> of
all which and their Errours, I have set downe a particular
Catalogue, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. As it was said of <hi>Caius Caesar, In uno Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sare
multi Marii;</hi> and as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith of the Familie of the <hi>Bruti,</hi>
that it had in it <hi>multorum insitam at<expan>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> illuminatam virtutem:</hi> so
in one Anabaptist you have many Heretiques, and in this one
Sect as it were one stock, many erroneous and schismaticall
positions, and practices ingraffed, and as it were <hi>inoculated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, in regard of their audacious attempts upon
Church and State, and their insolent acts committed in the
face of the Sun, and in the eye of the high Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Whereas other depravers of the Doctrine, or distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Peace of the Church, whether Papists, Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
or Arminians, who in the later times have braved it
and <hi>set up their top and top-gallant,</hi> yet since <hi>Argus</hi> with his
hundred eyes hath pryed into every corner of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and severall roomes in the great Ship of the Church,
have <hi>bestowed</hi> themselves <hi>under the hatches,</hi> and layne close
in obscurity: these with the forwardest of the Brownists
strut in the <hi>upper deck,</hi> and discover themselves with open
face, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and upbraid the State with their merit in
hazarding their estate and persons in this present War, and
boast with swelling words of vanity that they expect some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more then a toleration.<note place="margin">See The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritane, p. 75, 76. that the Parl. will stop all proceedings against them, and for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture provide that as well particular and private congregations as publike, may have publike prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; that all Statures against the Separatists be reviewed, and repealed; that the Presse may be free for any man that writes nothing scandalous or dangerous to the State; that this Parliament prove themselves loving Fathers to all sorts of good men, bearing respect unto all, and so inviting an equall assistance and affection from all.</note> They preach, and print, and
practise their Hereticall impieties openly; they hold their

Conscience (maintained by Master</hi> Calvin, Beza, Cotton, <hi>and
the Ministers of the New English Churches) is guilty of all the
blood of the soules crying for vengeance under the Altar:</hi> Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
a Tractate of Divorce, in which the bonds of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
are let loose to inordinate lust, and putting away wives
for many other causes besides that which our Saviour only
approveth, namely, in case of Adultery. Witnesse a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet
newly come forth, intituled, <hi>Mans Mortality,</hi> in which
the soule is cast into an Endymion sleep, from the houre of
death to the day of Judgement. Witnesse a bold Libell of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb facs="tcp:60443:5"/>
to hundreds, and to some at the doore of the house of
Commons, called <hi>The Vindication of the Royall Commission of
King Iesus,</hi> wherein the brazen fac'd Author blusheth not
to brand all the Reformed Churches, and the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
world at this day, which christen their children, &amp; sign
them with the seale of the Covenant, with the odious name
of an <hi>Antichristian faction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, In regard of the peculiar malignity this heresie
hath to Magistracie; other heresies are stricken by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
this strikes at Authority it selfe, undermineth the <hi>powers
that are ordained of God,</hi> and endeavoureth to wrest the sword
out of the Magistrates hand, to whom God hath given it for
the cutting off of all heresie, and impiety; and if this Sect
prevaile, we shall have no Monarchie in the State, nor Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie
in the Church, but an Anarchie in both. It grieveth
a Religious eye to see other vermine corrupting other Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers
of Paradise, as our <hi>sweet Violets,</hi> and <hi>fragrant Roses,</hi> and
<hi>fairest Lillies,</hi> and <hi>various Iulyflowers,</hi> and <hi>blushing Emmenies,</hi>
and <hi>beautifull Tulips:</hi> but most of all to see this heresie, like
a venemous serpent, lying at the root of the <hi>Crown-Imperiall,</hi>
which if it be not killed, will so poyson it, that the leaves
will fall off by degrees, and the <hi>stalke</hi> it selfe shortly <hi>wither.</hi>
We read in the Prophecie of <hi>Zacharie</hi> of two staves, the
<hi>staffe of beauty,</hi> and <hi>the staffe of bonds,</hi> which supported the
State and Church of Israel. By the <hi>staffe of beauty</hi> or <hi>comli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,</hi>
the Lawes of every Kingdome and Common-wealth
may be understood, which beare up the State, and preserve
decent order and comlinesse among men; By the <hi>staffe of
bonds</hi> the covenants and oathes whereby the members are
firmly <hi>tyed</hi> to their head, and one to another. If the <hi>staffe of
beauty</hi> be broken, there will be a down-fall of all good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and government: if the <hi>staffe of bonds</hi> be broken, all things
will be at a <hi>loose end.</hi> Me thinks I see these two staves shining
<pb facs="tcp:60443:6"/>
in the <hi>golden Maces</hi> borne before you; the <hi>staffe of beauty</hi> in
that borne before the House of Commons, in which the
<hi>Legislative power</hi> and the <hi>beautifull order</hi> of the severall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
of this Kingdome are conspicuous; the <hi>staffe of bonds</hi>
in that which is carryed before the House of Peers, in which
the <hi>power of Iudicature,</hi> even to <hi>bonds</hi> and death, principally
resideth. Now because these heretiques alone professedly
teach the exautorating all Christian Magistrates,<note place="margin">

all Books, and helps of mine owne Notes and Collections lately ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

I confesse to my griefe it doth, but what will you have me doe,
<hi>Situ &amp; otio torpescere?</hi> Such a rest would be most restlesse and
tedious; The lesse I doe, the more I must needs suffer; and the more
I doe, the lesse I suffer. And beleeve me, Sir, it is not an ambition
to be seene in the <hi>Presse,</hi> but a desire for the time to forget my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable
<hi>pressures,</hi> which hath now set me on worke. As when we
<pb facs="tcp:60443:8"/>
have the world at will, and can give our Mind her vagaries at
pleasure, to fixe or thoughts on any certaine subject, is a kind of
<hi>incarceration of the spirit;</hi> so when our Estate is <hi>sequestred,</hi>
and our person <hi>confined,</hi> and no theame is given us daily to enlarge
upon, but the valuing of our unvaluable losses, and the present sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
of our importunate wants, to divert our minds from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
upon our deplorate estate, and forcibly confining our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to a more pleasant subject, is a great ease and kind of liberty
to immured thoughts.</p>
            <p>But this is not all, for as S. <hi>Jerome</hi> thought wheresoever he
was, whatsoever he did, he heard the sound of the last Trumpet,
and the summons of the Archangel, <hi>Surgite mortui, &amp; venite ad

            <p>What wilt thou say of Infants that neither experimentally know the
grace of Baptisme, nor the losse by want thereof? Shall we baptize them?
Yes, by all meanes, if there be any danger; For it were better that they
should be sanctified, though they be not sensible thereof, then to goe out of
this world without the seal and badge of their initiation into Christianity.</p>

            <head>A true Relation of what passed at a
meeting in Southwark, between D. Featley,
and a company of Anabaptists, <date>October
17. 1642.</date>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the Company were placed, and Dr. <hi>Featley</hi>
had made a short ejaculatory Prayer to GOD,
to give a blessing to the meeting, a Scotchman
began thus.</p>
            <p>M. Doctor,<note place="margin">Scotch-man.</note> we come to dispute with you at this time,
not for contention sake, but to receive satisfaction: wee hold that the
Baptisme of Infants cannot be proved lawfull by the Testimony of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or by Apostolicall tradition; if you therefore can prove the same ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, we shall willingly submit unto you.</p>
            <p>Are you then Anabaptists? I am deceived in my expectation,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note>
I thought that the ending of this meeting had bin to have reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with you about other matters, and that my taske would have
beene to have justified our Communion-Booke, and the lawfulnesse
and necessity of comming to the Church, which I am ready to
doe. Anabaptisme (which I perceive is the poynt you hold) is an
heresie long since condemned both by the Greeke and Latine
Church, and I could have wished also that you had brought schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
with you, who knew how to dispute, which I conceive you doe
not, so farre as I guesse by your habit, and am informed concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
your professions: for there are but two wayes of disputing,
First by Authority,
Secondly by reason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:60443:12"/>
First by Authority, if you will dispute in Divinity, you must be
able to produce the Scriptures in the Originall Languages,</p>
            <p>For no Translation is simply authenticall, or the undoubted word of
God.</p>
            <p>In the undoubted word of God there can be no Error.</p>
            <p>But in Translations there may be, and are errors.</p>
            <p>The Bible Translated therefore is not the undoubted word of God,
but so farre onely as it agreeth with the Original, which (as I am infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
none of you understand.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if you will dispute by Reason, you must conclude
syllogistically in mood and figure, which I take to be out of your
Element. However, sith you have so earnestly desired this meeting,
and have propounded a Question to me I little expected: before I
answer yours, I will propound a Question or two to you concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the blessed Trinity, that I may know whether you are well
instructed in the principles of Catechisme, who yet are so well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
of your selves, that you take upon you to teach others.</p>
            <p>This, M. Doctor,<note place="margin">Scotch-man.</note> is <hi>nihil ad Rhombum,</hi> we would know of your whether
the Baptism of Children can be proved lawful (as we said before) as it is
practised among you.</p>
            <p>Whereas you say this my question is not <hi>ad Rhombum,</hi> you mistake
the matter.<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> For it is <hi>ad Rhombum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Section 1.</note> if you know what the Phrase
meaneth.<note place="margin">Two Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity propounded.</note> Is not the form of Baptisme this? <hi>I Baptize thee in the name
of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost?</hi> therfore my questions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Trinity appertain to the Doctrine of Baptisme. Before
therefore I answer you concerning the persons fit to be Baptized,
whether men and women onely in riper years, or children also: to
try your skill, I will propound an argument to each of you out of
Scripture, concerning the blessed Trinity.</p>
            <p>And first, (turning to the <hi>Scotchman</hi>)</p>
            <p>Doe you believe, saith hee, that each of the three persons is
God? how then doth Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 3. say that the Father is the
<hi>onely</hi> true God?</p>
            <p>2. After turning to the other.</p>
            <p>Doe you believe that the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father,

there is no mention at all of proceeding from the Son, but the

his Father, as the true God, to all false Gods.</p>
            <p>I doe not urge the word <hi>true,</hi>
               <note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> for that indeed is spoken in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to false Gods, but the word <hi>only,</hi> and thus I frame the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p>If God the Father be the <hi>only</hi> true God, then the holy
Ghost is not God.</p>
            <p>But God the Father is the onely true God;</p>

the onely true God, in respect of Essence;<note place="margin">The vente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Scotch-man was so slunnied with this blow, that he gave in, and spake no m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I come not here to dispute, but to receive satisfaction of some doubts, which
if you can resolve me in, I shal submit. Now for the place you alledge out of
S. <hi>John,</hi> I conceive it may be thus answered: Christ spake this as man,
and his meaning is that his Father is only God, and no Creature is so.</p>
            <p>It is very true, that <hi>only</hi> excludes all creatures; but whereas you
say that these words are spoken by Christ,<note place="margin">D Featley.</note> as man onely, it cannot
stand with the Text; for it is added, <hi>and whom thou hast sent, Iesus
Christ.</hi> Christ saith it is life Eternall to know the Father to be the
onely true God, and whom he hath sent, Jesus Christ; but it is not
life Eternall to know Christ onely as man, but as true God and
man, and so a perfect Mediator: neither is Christ said only the Son
of God, in respect of his temporall generation, as man; but also in
respect of his eternal generation as he is the second person in Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
this answer therefore of yours is not sufficient nor pertinent.</p>
            <p>M. Doctor,<note place="margin">Sir John Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thall.</note> the company is not satisfied with their Answers, I pray, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve

            <p>I will, as soone as they have propounded their objections; for, I

how unfit these men are to take upon them the office of Teachers,

Now let them propound what questions they please.</p>
            <p>What is the nature of a visible Church?<note place="margin">Cufin.</note> what is the matter and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Your Question is, <hi>Quid constituit visibilem Ecclesiam,</hi> what makes a

            <p>Yes.</p>
            <p>I answer, according to the Scriptures and the joynt consent of
of all protestant Churches in the world,<note place="margin">D Featley.</note> French, Dutch, &amp;c.
in the harmony of confessions,<note place="margin">Cufin.</note> that the sincere preaching of the

                  </gap>
               </note> and the due administration of the Sacraments, constitutes or
makes a true visible Church. The Papists make many notes of the
Church,<note place="margin">Of the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a true Church,</note> as antiquity, universality, succession, miracles, and diverse
other: but the reformed Churches make but two onely, namely
those above mentioned.</p>
            <p>What is a true particular visible church?<note place="margin">Cufin.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A particular companie of men,<note place="margin">D Featley.</note> professing the christian faith,
knowne by the two marks above mentioned, the sincere preaching
of the word, and the due administration of the Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Is the church of <hi>England</hi> such a church?<note place="margin">Cufin.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is so.<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note>
            </p>
            <p>How prove you that?<note place="margin">Cufin.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">D. Feateley.</note> I answer, I need not to prove it, but you are to disprove it.
For as <hi>Hooker</hi> teacheth, in his Ecclesiasticall Politie, they who are
in possession are not bound to prove their right, but they who goe
about to thrust them out are to disprove their right, aud bring a
better title for themselves.</p>
            <p>Secondly, yet to give you further satisfaction, thus I prove the
church of <hi>England</hi> to be such a church.</p>
            <p>Every church in which the word of God is sincerely preached,<note place="margin">Section 3.</note> &amp;
the sacraments lawfully and rightly administred,<note place="margin">That the church of England is a true Church.</note> is such a church.</p>
            <p>But in the church of <hi>England</hi> the word is sincerely preached, and
the sacraments lawfully administred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> the church of <hi>England</hi> is such a church.</p>
            <p>I denie that in the church of <hi>England</hi> the word is sincerely preached,<note place="margin">Cufin.</note> or
the sacraments rightly administred.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60443:13"/>
I have here two things to prove.</p>
            <p>1. That the doctrine of the church of <hi>England</hi> is agreeable to
Gods word.</p>
            <p>2. The sacraments are rightly administred in it.</p>
            <p>First, the doctrine of the church of <hi>England</hi> is contained in the
39 Articles.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the due administration of the sacraments in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-book.
But both the one &amp; the other are agreeable to Gods
word.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> the preaching of the word and administration of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
in the church of <hi>England</hi> are agreeable to Gods word.</p>
            <p>I denie that the 39 Articles and the book of common-prayer are agreeable to
Gods word.<note place="margin">Cufin.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. I wil prove that the book of Articles is agreeable to Gods word.</p>
            <p>In the book of Articles, the first which concerneth the blessed
Trinity, the 2. 3. 4. which concern the incarnation of Christ Jesus his
death and resurrection, the 5. which concerneth the holy Ghost, the
6. the perfection of scriptures, and the 18. following, which impugn
popery, are agreeable to Gods word; and you cannot name any
one of the rest which is not agreeable; therefore they are all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable.
If you know any one that is not agreeable, instance in it,
and I will presently shew how it is agreeable to scripture.</p>
            <p>For the 39 Articles,<note place="margin">Cufin.</note> I know not what they are, I never saw them that I
remember.</p>
            <p>Then for ought you know they are all conformable to scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note>
at least you can except against none of them. Now for the
book of common-prayer, it consists partly of Psalms, Epistls, and
Gospels, partly of Prayers, and the form and manner of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of the sacraments. But the former are taken out of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the latter are agreeable to it. What doe you except against
it?</p>
            <p>I except against your administration of Baptism, it is not rightly admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
in your church;<note place="margin">Cufin.</note> for you baptize children, and that is not agreeable to
Gods word:<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note> if you say it is,<note place="margin">Section 4.</note> how doe you prove it by scriptures?</p>
            <p>This D. F. undertook to prove out of scriptures,<note place="margin">That the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell men to come to church, and serve God there according to his word.</note> but before he
alledged any text of scripture for it, another Anabaptist interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
            <p>You say your church is a true church; that cannot be: for the true church
compells none to come to church, or punishes him for his conscience, as the
church of <hi>England</hi> doth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:60443:14"/>
               <hi>Iosiah</hi> was supream governour of the true church in <hi>Iudah</hi>
and <hi>Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> but <hi>Iosiah</hi> compelled all <hi>Israel</hi> to come to the house
of God and worship him there, 2 <hi>Chron. 34. 33. So Iosiah took
away all the abominations out of all the countries that appertained to
the children of Israel, and compelled all that were found in Israel to serve
the Lord their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> men may be compelled by the civill magistrate to the
true worship of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Josiah</hi> compelled them to come to <hi>Jerusalem;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note> but that law is not now in
force.</p>
            <p>There is a three-fold law of God delivered by <hi>Moses.</hi>
               <note place="margin">D. Featley.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. Ceremoniall. 2. Judiciall. and 3. Morall. The ceremoniall
and judiciall are not now in force; but the morall is, and <hi>Iosiah</hi> did
this by the command of the morall law. For the text saith not
that he compelled them to come to <hi>Ierusalem, but to serve the Lord
their God,</hi> which is a dutie required by the morall law, and the law
of nature. For though the place of Gods Service and the manner
be changed, yet the substantiall worship of God still remains, and
princes are now as much bound to compell their subjects to the
true worship of God, as <hi>Iosiah</hi> was. And moreover it is to be noted,
that <hi>Iosiah</hi> did this by vertue of a covenant, which he made before
the Lord, <hi>to walk after the Lord, and keep his commandements, with all
his heart and all his soul, 2 Chro.</hi> 34. 31. And the spirit of God sendeth
this testimony after him, 2 <hi>King. 23. 15. Like unto him there was no
King before him, that turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his
soul, and with all his might,<note place="margin">Here this third Anabaptist was blank't, and, to save his credit, starts up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doubt.</note> according to the law of Moses;</hi> which words
have an apparent reference to that first and great commandement,
<hi>Deut. 6. 5. thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy might,</hi> which law is morall and perpetuall, as
all grant.</p>
            <p>Prove that any ought to be compelled by the gospel.<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That which <hi>Iosiah</hi> did agreeably to the morall law,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> bindeth us
under the gospel; for Christ in the gospel both repeateth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth
this commandement of <hi>loving the Lord, with all our heart, and
all our soul, calling it the first and great commandement,</hi> Mat. 22. 37. 38.
Therefore our princes are as much bound, as <hi>Iosiah</hi> was, to compell
their subjects to serve the true God. Yet farther to give you satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
I will prove that it is agreeable to the new law to compell
men to come to church, and hear Gods word and receive the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60443:14"/>
sacraments, for this Christ teacheth in the parable recorded by
S. <hi>Luke</hi> chap. 14. 23. <hi>Of a King who made a great supper, and bade many
guests, and when they made excuses, he said to his servant, g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
and hedges, and compell them to come in, that my house may be full.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this nothing being answered, D. <hi>Featley</hi> proceeded in his
argument. Besides this command in the parable, thus I prove, that
you ought to come to our churches; the Apostle commandeth,
<hi>Rom. 13. 1. Let every soul be subject to the higher powers,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.
<hi>Obey them that have the over-sight of you, and submit your selvs, for they
watch for your souls,</hi> &amp;c. To which, if we adde those places in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
2. 2. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. 14. An undeniable argument may be framed,
to convince your conscience, after this manner.</p>
            <p>All lawfull superiours, either temporall or spirituall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
lawfull things, are to be obeyed.</p>
            <p>But your lawfull superiours in church and common-wealth,
require you to come to our church, which I proved to be a true
church of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> you ought to obey them, and you sin against God by
your disobedience to lawfull authority, if you come not.</p>
            <p>The word of God doth not command us to come to your <hi>steeple-houses,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note>
the King hath nothing to doe to command us in that kind.</p>
            <p>The King hath power to command you in all things that are
lawfull,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> and not repugnant to Gods word: (indeed if he should
command any thing against Gods word, you ought rather to
obey God than man, by the example of the Apostle in the
<hi>Acts</hi> 4. 19.)</p>
            <p>But it is a thing lawfull and no way repugnant to Gods
word, but most agreeable thereunto to come to our <hi>steeple-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
(as you call them) where the servants of God assemble on
the Lords day and other times,<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note> to worship <hi>him in spirit and truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> the King hath power to command you to come to our
church.<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The King makes an Idoll of the church,<note place="margin">Here the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist yeeldeth the buckler, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate ought to be obeyed, when he commandeth men to hear Gods word in the church,</note> where doth Christ command us to
come to it?</p>
            <p>Where he commandeth us to hear the word preached; for, in
our church the word of God is preached, and therefore there we
ought to hear it.</p>
            <p>I am not so averse, but if one of our society should preach in <hi>Olaves,</hi> or
<hi>Mary Overis</hi> church, I would hear them, I would come where the church is
gathered, for therein I obey Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60443:15"/>
Then you will hear none but one'of your society,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> as if your societie
were the true church,<note place="margin">This was the plea of the old Donatists.</note> and none of the true church but those of
your society. I have proved already, that we have a true church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, but you have none.</p>
            <p>For where there are no lawfull pastors,<note place="margin">Section 5.</note> nor flocks, there is
not a true church.<note place="margin">That the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist shave no Church.</note> But amongst you there are not lawfull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
nor flocks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> no true church.</p>
            <p>We have amongst us lawfull Pastours.<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note>

            <p>There are no lawfull Pastors but those who are sent,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> Ro. 10.

            </p>
            <p>It seems you will willingly fall upon no other point but this
of Anabaptism,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> which heresy was condemned neer fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

a word, saying,<note place="margin">Section 6.</note>

            <p>If it were but a thousand, it is long enough, being condemned
by the whole Christian Church,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> 
               <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sir, that is neither here nor there, you know what the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi>
said, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Cufin.</note> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that at

            <p>You are mistaken in your chronology, for there were not 2000

            <p>We desire to have it proved by scripture.<note place="margin">Scotch-man.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Our proofs out of scripture are of two sorts;<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> some probable,
some necessarie.</p>
            <p>First probable; as where it is said in the <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 33. that the
<hi>Apostle baptized the Gaoler, with all that belonged</hi> to him and <hi>Lydia,
and her houshold,</hi> Acts. 16. 15. and 1 Cor. 1. 16. that <hi>he baptized the
houshold of Stephanas,</hi> and in a whole houshold in all probabilitie
there were some children.</p>
            <p>I cannot tell that; let's hear your necessary proofe out of Gods word.<note place="margin">Scotch-man.</note>
            </p>

of children,<note place="margin">Scotch-man.</note> that there was of old for the circumcising of them.
For there is an expresse command for circumcising of children; but there
is none for the baptizing of any but those who can hear the word preached,
<hi>Mat. 28. Go teach and baptize.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. That which circumcision was in the old law to the Jews,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> that
is baptisme now to us, the sacrament of entrance into the church;
for so St. <hi>Austine</hi> and all sound divines hold, that our sacrament of
baptisme answereth theirs of circumcision, as the sacrament of the
Lords supper doth their Paschall Lamb.</p>
            <p>2. Circumcision was instituted, as appears, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. to be <hi>a
seal of the righteousnesse of faith.</hi> But for the same end also was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
instituted, to be a seal of the covenant of grace, and the
free remission of our sins by faith. And though children in the old
law before eight dayes had not actuall faith, nor could make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
thereof, yet they received the sacrament thereof. Therefore
by the same reason children under the gospel, though they have
not actuall faith, nor can make profession thereof, yet may and

                  <hi>Featley.</hi>
               </note> first, I will alledge you the text of scripture, and then
frame my argument from it; the place of scripture is, <hi>Ioh. 3. 5.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a man he born of water, and of the
spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> My argument from
this place for the baptizing of infants is this:</p>
            <p>If none can enter into the kingdom of God, but those that
are born of water and the spirit; that is, those that are baptized
with water, and regenerated by the spirit, then is there a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of baptizing children, or else they cannot enter into the
kingdom of God; (that is, ordinarily) for we must not tye
God to outward means.</p>
            <p>But the former is true.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> the latter.</p>
            <p>By this your reason it would follow that all that are baptized are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>cotch-man.</note>
and none regenerated but those who are baptized; what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
then of those who dye without baptisme?</p>
            <p>I conceive the same of them as of those among the Jews who
dyed before they were circumcised;<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> we leave them to the mercy of
God, conceiving charitably of their salvation, because the children
of the faithfull are comprised in the covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. and <hi>Acts.</hi>
2. 39. and the Apostle saith, <hi>They are holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 14. All that I
will conclude from this place, is, that no children enter into the
kingdom of heaven by the ordinary way chalked out by Christ but
those who are baptized; or, which comes all to one, that the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of baptisme ought to be administred to children, as the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
means of their salvation.</p>
            <p>This text speaks not of children, but of men;<note place="margin">Cufin.</note> children are not

            <p>I will prove unto you M. Doctor, that neither you, nor such men as

preaching,<note place="margin">Infra &amp; articl 2. argum. 8.</note> as are appoynted by us.</p>
            <p>How prove you that?<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Those who are ordained ministers by ungodly men,<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note> ought not to
preach. But you, and others as you are, be ordained by ungodly
men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo,</hi> you ought not to preach.</p>
            <p>I denie both your propositions.<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> First, because although we should
suppose the bishops, who ordained ministers, to be ungodly men,
yet if they were themselves lawfully ordained, and had power of
imposition of hands, the ministers ordained by them, may and
ought to discharge their function. <hi>Iudas</hi> the Apostle, and <hi>Nicholas</hi>
the deacon, were ungodly men; yet the ministeriall acts they did,
either in preaching the word, or administring the sacraments, were
never accounted void. Secondly, I denie that our bishops were
ungodly men.</p>
            <q>
               <l>They that persecute good men are ungodly men.<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note>
               </l>
               <l>But all your bishops persecute good men.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the bishops are ungodly men.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60443:17"/>
I answer: first,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> some of our bishops never persecuted any man; as
namely, the Arch-bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and bishop <hi>Potter.</hi> Secondly,
though some of our bishops by their places, as they were high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners,
punished some men by Mulcts, imprisonments, or other
censures; yet they persecuted no godly man, but executed justice
upon delinquents: namely, factious schismaticks that disobey the
Kings ecclesiasticall laws, and disturb the peace of the church.</p>
            <p>Yea,<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note> but they are good men whom your bishops persecute, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
except the bishop of <hi>Armagh;</hi> for when I was called in question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the high commission, the Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> sate there, and by si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
gave consent.</p>
            <p>The Primate of <hi>Ireland</hi> was never a Judge in our high commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> as it is well known: sometimes he might sit with
the rest, but he had no power to give sentence in the high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
in <hi>England;</hi> and if I might know truly for what cause you
were brought into the high commission, I doubt not but to prove
the sentence given against you to be just; for you are one who
come not to church, nor will hear our preachers, but only some of
your own sect, and those no better then meer Lay-men.</p>
            <p>We do no read of any such distinction in the word of God,<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note> as Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Clergy-men,<note place="margin">SECT. 7.</note> these are popish distinctions;<note place="margin">Of the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Clergy &amp; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks.</note> the word. Lay is not

            <p>No more is the word Trinity, nor sacrament, nor many others
read in scripture,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> yet the sense of them is there, and so is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of Clergy and Laitie;<note place="margin">And that none may exercise the function of a minister of the Gospel, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a speciall calling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto</note> for God commandeth that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

other then the Clergy, and the common people then the Laity.</p>
            <p>Their Priest-hood was not the same with yours.</p>
            <p>It was the same for substance, but not for ceremony and manner
of worship; their Priest-hood was typicall, ours evangelicall; they
by the figures of the ceremoniall law fore-shewed Christ to come,<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note>
we preach that Christ is come.<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Can you prove any such distinctions in the new testament?<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We can:<note place="margin">D. Featley,</note> for we read in the new testament of pastours and flocks;
they who feed with the word, are the Clergy; and the flocks who
are fed, are the Laity. All are not pastours or teachers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 29.
<hi>Are all Apostles? are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> That is, all are
not so.</p>
            <p>Deacons preached, they were Lay-men,<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note> therefore may Lay-men

            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60443:17"/>
The Deacons were not meer Lay-men,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> but men full of the holy
Ghost, and of wisedom, upon whom the Apostles layd their hands,
<hi>Acts</hi> 6. 6. Prove that any preached who had not imposition of
hands.</p>
            <p>Here that Anabaptist failing, <hi>Cufin</hi> undertook it, saying;</p>
            <p>In the 8. of the <hi>Acts</hi> we read plainly,<note place="margin">Cufin.</note> that, after that great persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the church at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> they were all scattered abroad through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the regions of <hi>Judea,</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> except the Apostles; and that
they who were scattered abroad went every where, preached the gospel;
and that God gave a blessing to their preaching, it is plain, <hi>Acts 11. 19.
Again,</hi> (Peter <hi>saith) 1 Pet. 4. 10. As every man hath received the
spirit, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards
of the manifold grace of Christ.</hi> If God have given us a talent, it is
our duty to improve it.</p>
            <p>They that were scattered and preached the gospel,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> were such as
the Apostles had layd hands on, and sent to preach, and among
them <hi>Philip</hi> the Deacon there mentioned. For the text of S. <hi>Peter;</hi>
he speaketh not there of publike preaching, and administring the
sacraments, which appertaineth only to pastours by their speciall
function; but of edifying one another, and teaching and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
in private,<note place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 11.</note> according to the precept of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Colos. 3. 16.
<hi>Let the word of God dwell richly among you, in all wisedom, teaching
and admonishing one another:</hi> this was no publike preaching, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
the word, but godly conference in private houses with
those whom they met, such as every godly master of a family u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
in his house, instructing his children and servants the best
that he can, telling them their duty out of Gods word. It is true,
in time of persecution we read of one <hi>Frumentius</hi> a Lay-man, who
in his travailes converted some to the christian faith, confirming
the truth of christian religion by scriptures.</p>
            <p>That is all we desire to do, as <hi>Frumentius</hi> did.</p>
            <p>That was no preaching publikely by vertue of a pastorall fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,<note place="margin">Cufin.</note>
or expounding scriptures,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> but holy conference and exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
such as that of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla.</hi> And the historian addeth,
after the church had notice how God blessed <hi>Frumentius</hi> his labours,
in turning many heathen to christinity; the bishops sent mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
unto them, to confirm them and administer the sacraments
unto them; and himself also received holy orders, to accomplish
that work which he had so happily begun.</p>

reasons especially.</p>
            <p>First, none ought to take upon them the office of pastour, or

and all gain-sayers: but your lay and unlettered men are
not able to convince Hereticks, and stop the mouths of gayn-savers,
because they can alledge no scripture but that which is translated into
their mother-tongue, in which there may be and are some errours:
for, though the Scriptures be the infallible word of God, yet the
translators were men subject to errour, and they sometimes mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took.</p>

            <p>Very fine doctrine; if God reveal not to us the meaning of the
scripture,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> is not the letter of the text scripture? By this reason, the
greatest part of the Revelation, and other difficult texts of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
should not be scripture, because God hath not revealed to us
the meaning of them.</p>
            <p>Here one that stood by demanded of the Anabaptist; how
prove you the bible to be Gods word?</p>
            <p>By experience. For, whatsoever is written in the word of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to passe,<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note> concerning Christ and Anti-christ; experience is the best
doctor that teacheth us.</p>
            <p>This reason alone will not prove the bible to be Gods word;<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> for
<hi>Moses</hi> saith, <hi>If a false prophet shall arise, and fore-tell any thing, and it
come to passe,</hi> Deut. 13. 2. <hi>thou shalt not hearken to the words of that
prophet, for the Lord thy God proveth you;</hi> it is true, that argument
with others makes a good proof.</p>
            <p>There is no false prophet in the scripture, the pen-men thereof were
all true prophets,<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note> and spake from the mouth of God.</p>
            <p>I grant you, they did; yet by this argument alone you cannot
convince an Atheist,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> or a Mahumetan: for in <hi>Mahomets Alc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ron</hi> it
is said, that <hi>Mahomet</hi> was a true prophet, and that the Angel spake
to him from God; you see to what a miserable plunge you are put, if
you have no more knowledge then meerly the translation of the
English bible.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the event of prophesies you speak of, how prove
you the event of them? For the events of the latter prophesies are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60443:19"/>
not set down in scripture; as namely, of the destruction of the
temple, and the dispersion of the Jews into all nations.</p>
            <p>Travellers can testifie the truth of that.<note place="margin">Anabaptist.</note> Besides, some here, I doubt
not, can witnesse.</p>
            <p>I believe it;<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> but these travellers their report, and the testimonie
of those witnesse you speak of, are no ground of our christian
faith; you see therefore that you are still to seek, and not able to
convince any Jew, Pagan, or Mahumetan, out of your translated
bible without other helps of learning, which you want.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note> I prove that none of your Lay-men, who have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
holy orders, may take upon them the sacred office of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the word, and administring the sacraments. The office of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
is a holy office, which none may meddle with but those who
have a lawfull calling thereunto. To which purpose I alledged di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
texts out of the new testament before: whereunto I will adde
the fearfull judgments of God in the old testament, which fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Lay-men who medled with the priests office. As first, the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that fell upon <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> Numb. 16. 3:
<hi>Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation is holy, every one
of them, and the Lord is amongst them: wherefore then lift ye up your
selvs above the congregation of the Lord? v. 28. And Moses said, if
these men diethe common death of all men, or if they be visited after
the visitation of all men, the Lord hath not sent me.</hi> v. 31. <hi>And assoon
as he had made an end of speaking all these words, the ground clave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder
that was under them,</hi> v. 32. <hi>And the earth opened her mouth,
and swallowed them up with their families, and all the men that were
with Corah, and all their goods.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Uzza,</hi> who put forth his
hand to stay the Arke, 2 <hi>Sam. 6. 6. 7. And when they came to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chons
threshing floor, Uzza put his hand to the Arke of God, and held it,
for the oxen did shake it.</hi> v. 7. <hi>And the Lord was very wroth with Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,
and God smote him in the same place for his fault, and there he dyed
by the Arke of God.</hi> Thirdly, upon <hi>Uzziah,</hi> who, for taking upon
him to offer incense which belonged to the priests office, was stric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with a Leprosie that clave to him till his death, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 18.
19. 20. 21. <hi>And they withstood Uzziah the King, and said unto him,
it pertaineth not to thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the Lord, but to
the priests, the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated for to offer incense:
go forth of the Sanctuarie, for thou hast transgressed, and thou shalt have
no honour of the Lord God. Then Uzziah was wroth, and had incense in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60443:19"/>
his hand to burn it; and while he was wroth with the priests,
the Leprosie rose up in his fore-head, before the priests, in the house of the
Lord, besides the incense Altar. And when Azariah the chief priest
with all the priests looked upon him, behold, he was Leprous in his fore-head,
and they caused him hastily to depart thence, and he was even
compelled to go out, because the Lord had smitten him. And Uzziah the
King was a Leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt as a Leper in a
house apart, because he was cut off from the house of the Lord.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
upon husband-men and heards-men, that took upon them to
prophesie, <hi>Zach. 13. 4. 5. 6. And in that day shall the prophets be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed,
every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied; then they shall
wear a rough garment no more to deceive. But he shall say, I am no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:
I am a husband-man; for men taught me to be an herds-man from
my youth up.</hi> So you artificers may be ashamed of your prophesying,

Anabaptists went away discontented, the fourth seemed in part satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
&amp; desired a second meeting; but the next day, conferring with
the rest of that sect, he altered his resolution; and neither he, nor any

            </p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Additions to the former Conference.</head>
               <p>IN the conference above mentioned, <hi>D. F.</hi> promised to prove the
baptisme of children: 1. By scripture. 2. By consent of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
church. And 3. by evident reason. And the arguments drawn
from the first head he prosecuted, but was not permitted at that time
to urge the arguments drawn from the second and third heads: yet,
because they were desired by some persons of note, it was thought
fit they should be added to the former.</p>
               <p>Next to the arguments drawn from expresse testimony of scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for the baptisme,<note place="margin">D. Featley.</note> of children, we have a most forcible argument
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60443:20"/>
drawn from the consent of the universall church,<note place="margin">The consent of the catholike Christian church for the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</note> testified by their
constant practise of admitting children to baptisme, even from the
Apostles dayes unto this present. This argument, if it be well weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is of very great moment, and may convince the conscience of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ingenuous Christian. For no Christian doubteth, but that the
Apostles were inspired by the holy Ghost, and Christ promised his
spirit to lead his church into all truth; which promise he hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
made good in such sort, that it cannot be proved that ever
the whole church of Christ unversally erred; it is true, particular
churches have erred, and may erre, and generall councels, which the
schools tearm the representative church, are subject to error, and
have sometimes decreed heresie and false-hood for truth; but the
formall church as they speak, that is, all the assemblies of Christians
in the world cannot be impeached with error at any time: whence
I thus frame my argument.</p>
               <p>That which the Apostles in their dayes began, and the whole
christian church scattered over the face of the whole earth hath
continued in all ages, and all countries where christianity hath
been, and is professed, cannot be an erroneous practise.</p>
               <p>But the catholike christian church, in all places and ages, even
from the Apostles times, hath admitted the children of faithfull
parents to holy baptisme.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo</hi> the practise of christening children cannot be erroneous
or unwarrantable, as the Anabaptists teach.</p>
               <p>The major or first proposition is already sufficiently proved; the
minor or second proposition is proved by the testimony of <hi>Origen</hi>
for the Greek church, and S. <hi>Austin</hi> for the Latine, and the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
stories in all ages. <hi>Origen,</hi> in his Commentarie upon the sixt
chapter of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> having alledged the words of the
prophet <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 51. 5. <hi>I was born in iniquity, and in sin hath my
mother conceived me;</hi> addeth, <hi>proper hoc ecclesia ab Apostolis tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem
accepit parvulis dare baptismum (for this reason,</hi> namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all are conceived in sin) <hi>the church hath received a tradition
from the Apostles to administer baptisme to little infants.</hi> And St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,
l.</hi> 10. de genesi ad literam, c. 23. <hi>Consuetudo matris ecclesie in
baptizandis parvulis non spernenda est, nec omnino credenda esset nisi
Apostolica esset traditio; the custome of our mother the church, in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
infants, is no way to be sleighted or rejected; neither were it at all
to be beleeved if it were not an Apostolicall tradition.</hi> As for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60443:21"/>
continuance of it, the hystorie of all ages of the church confirms it;
neither can there be brought an instance in any Christian church in
the world that denyed baptisme to children, til this sect arose in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
since the reformation began there, in the dayes of <hi>Henry</hi> the
eight.</p>
               <p>After the testimonies of scriptures, and the practise of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
church, we have a third proof drawn from evidence of Reason;
against which, if it be excepted that the eye of reason in matter of
faith is but dim; and therefore, that such arguments are no way
convincing: I answer, that it is true, that such arguments drawn
from reason, as have no other ground but philosophicall axioms,
or sensible experiments are of little force in matter of faith, which
is above reason; but such reasons as have ground and foundation
in scripture, and are firmly built upon those foundations, are of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great force, and such are those I purpose to alledge.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Arguments drawn from reason for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bristening children.</note> where the disease is, there ought the remedy to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>But the disease, to wit, originall sin is in children, as well as
men. For, <hi>all have sinned in Adam,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. and <hi>are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
the children of wrath,</hi> Ephesi. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the remedy which is baptisme, ought to be applied to
children as well as men.</p>
               <p>Secondly, those who are comprised within the covenant of
grace, ought to be admitted into the church by baptisme. For
to them appertain both the promises of the new testament and
the seal thereof, which is baptisme.</p>
               <p>But the children of the faithfull are comprised within the
covenant of grace, <hi>Gen. 17. 7. I will establish my covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
me and thee, and thy seed after thee, for an everlasting cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, children ought to be admitted into the church by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, no means of salvation ought to be denyed to the
children of the faithfull, whereof they are capable.</p>
               <p>But baptisme is an outward means of salvation, whereof
children are capable under the gospel, as well as the children of
the Jews were capable of circumcision under the law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> baptisme ought not to be denied to children.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, all those who receive the thing signified by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60443:21"/>
ought to receive the outward sign. It is the argument of
St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 10. 47. <hi>Can any man forbid water that these
should not be baptized, which have received the holy Ghost as well
as we?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the children of the faithfull receive the thing signified by
baptisme; to wit, regeneration and remission of sins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> they ought to receive the sign; to wit, the baptisme of
water.</p>
               <p>The proposition or major is proved alreadie; the assumption or
minor is thus proved; Christ <hi>bad children come to him, and he
blessed them; (and said) of such is the kingdom of God,</hi> Mar. 10. 16.
and that <hi>their Angels continually behold his Fathers face in heaven,</hi>
Mat. 18. 10. and unlesse the Anabaptists will grant that children are
regenerated, and receive remission of sins, they must needs hold that
all children are damned, which is a most uncharitable and damnable
assertion.</p>

               <head>The ANABAPTISTS Objection.</head>
               <p>Yea, but the Anabaptists object, <hi>Mat. 28. 18. Go teach all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
baptizing them.</hi> Whence they would infer that none are to be
baptized but those to whom the gospel hath before bin preached; &amp;
consequently, that children ought not to be baptized before they
can hear and understand the gospel preached to them.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="answer">
               <head>ANSWER.</head>
               <p>1. The setting preaching before baptizing doth no more
prove that preaching must alwaies go before baptisme, then the
naming repentance before faith, (<hi>Mar. 1. 15. Repent, and beleeve
the gospel</hi>) proves, that repentance goeth alwayes before faith,
which the Anabaptists themselves hold not.</p>
               <p>2. Christ setteth in that place preaching before baptizing for
two reasons, neither of which make any thing against the baptisme
of children. The first is, because it is the more principall act of the
ministeriall function, for it is preaching which through the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the holy Spirit begetteth faith, which the sacraments only
confirme; preaching draweth the instrument as it were of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
between God and us, whereunto the sacrament is set as
a seal. Secondly, because Christ there speaketh of converting whole
nations to the Christian faith, in which alwayes the preaching of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60443:22"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  </gap>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:60443:23"/>
the word goeth before the administration of the sacraments. For,
first men beleeve, and after are admitted to baptisme, but after
the parents are converted, their children being comprised within
the covenant are admitted to baptisme; and whensoever any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyte
is to be made, this course is likewise to be taken, they must
professe their faith before they be received into the church by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme:
but the case is different in children, they have neither the
use of reason to apprehend the gospel preached unto them, nor use
of their tongue to professe their faith, and God requireth no more
of them then he hath given them; the like course God himself
took in the old law, before any men of riper years were circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
the commandement of God was declared, and his covenant
made known unto them, but children were circumcised the eight
day before they were capable of any preaching unto them, or such
declaration.</p>
               <p>Nothing remaineth, but that the two objections concerning the
doctrine of the Trinitie in the beginning propounded by <hi>D. F.</hi> for
no other end, but to try how well verst these ring-leaders of the
Anabaptists were in the more necessary points of catechisme; he
answered:</p>
               <p>The first was framed out of <hi>Ioh. 17. 3. This is life eternall, to
know thee to be the only true God, and whom thou hast sent, Iesus Christ.</hi>
If the Father be the <hi>only</hi> true God, how is the Son or the holy
Ghost very God? Hereunto the Anabaptists gave two answers;
the first, blaspemous, the second, unsufficient and impertinent, as
appears in the beginning of the conference. The true answer is,
that Christ, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. prayeth to God, and not to any of the three
Persons particularly; for though he useth the word <hi>Father,</hi> v. 1.
yet <hi>Father</hi> is not there taken for the first Person in Trinity, but as
a common attribute of the deity, as it is also taken, <hi>Mat. 6. 9. Our
Father,</hi> v. 14. <hi>your heavenly Father,</hi> Gal. 1. 4. <hi>God and our Father.</hi>
Jam. 1. 27. <hi>Before God and the Father.</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 17. <hi>If you call him
Father, who judgeth without respect of persons:</hi> So then, the meaning
is, O God, Father of heaven and earth, <hi>This is life eternall, to know
thee to be the only true God, and whom thou hast sent, Iesus Christ.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to which interpretation, this text is parallel to that of the
Apostle, <hi>one God, and one Mediator betwixt God and man; the man,
Christ Iesus,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5.</p>
               <p>The second objection was out of <hi>Ioh. 15. 26. The spirit of truth
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60443:23"/>
which proceedeth from the Father.</hi> If the spirit proceed from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
only, how do we say in the Nicen creed, and that other of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius,</hi>
and in the Letany, <hi>which proceedeth from the Father and
the Son?</hi> To this none of the Anabaptists gave any answer at all,
yet the answer is very easie; for the spirit is said to proceed from
the Father in the place above alledged, because he proceedeth from
the Father originally, not because he proceedeth from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
only, for he is elsewhere called the <hi>spirit of the Son,</hi> as well as
of the Father, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 6. And in this very text, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 26. it is
said, <hi>the spirit whom I will send you from the Father;</hi> which sheweth
that the holy Spirit hath a dependance from both. To whom, three
Persons and one only true God, be ascribed all glory, honour,
power, and dominion, for evermore.</p>

these are not so many distinct and severall sorts of Anabaptists.
For some of these differ only in respect of their doctors or teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and not of their doctrines, as the Muncerians, Hutites, &amp; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonists;
others were hereticks, more ancient then the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second broached theirs about the year, 380. which was this;
<hi>That none were rightly baptised, but those that held with</hi> Donatus, <hi>and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60443:24"/>
consequently, that all other, who had received baptisme in the catholike

               </p>
               <p>The third broached theirs in the year 1525. which was this; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

very plausible pretences for it; namely, that hereticks were mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants,

and that therefore they had no power by their baptisme to admit

church; which, as he affirmeth, received hereticks upon their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
&amp; recantation of their heresies, without re-baptizing them.
But St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> a famous bishop in <hi>Africa</hi> in those dayes, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
a glorious Martyr, took Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> to task, refelled his
argument drawn from unwritten tradition by scripture, and in a
provinciall Synod held at <hi>Carthage,</hi> whereof he was president,
<hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 258. with the joynt suffrages of 87. bishops, condemns
the sentence of the Roman Synod, and determines the flat contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorie
thereunto; namely, that the baptisme administred by he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks

ought to be brought again to the font, and be christened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new,

And truely <hi>Erasmus,</hi> in his Preface to his Edition of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>
affirmeth it to be an <hi>even lay</hi> between both opinions; and that
though the church in latter ages took part with <hi>Stephen,</hi> yet that

the Trinity, and maintained the true form of baptisme; and all
those, who were baptized by these latter sort of hereticks, the
church held their baptisme good, and therefore did not re-baptize
them when they received them into the church, but only enjoyned
them publikely to renounce their errours: but those who had been
baptized by the former sort of hereticks, in regard their baptisme
was indeed no baptisme, the church appoynted, agreeably unto this
decree of the Synod of <hi>Nice,</hi> that they should not be admitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a new baptisme.</p>
               <p>For the second sort of <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> they were far worse then the
former; for they made a separation from the catholike Christian
church, holding that none were members thereof, but those that
held with <hi>Donatus,</hi> all other they accounted no Christians; and
therefore, if any were converted, or rather perverted to their here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
they christened them again. The former sort of <hi>Anabaptists</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60443:25"/>
were accounted only erroneous and schismaticall, but not heretical;
but these were stigmatized for heretiks also, and that deservedly,
for confining the church of Christ only to <hi>Africa,</hi> and their sect
there: they consequently denied a main article of the Creed, (<hi>viz.)
Credo sanctam ecclesiam catholicam,</hi> I beleeve the holy catholike
church, and the communion of saints. Yet with these hereticks and
schismaticks, our <hi>Iacobites, Brownists,</hi> and <hi>Barrowsts,</hi> symbolize;
for, as the <hi>Donatists</hi> refused communion with the catholike church,
in regard of some scandalls they observed in it, so do these separate
from the true church of <hi>England</hi> in regard of some abuses, and, as
they tearm them, popish corruptions in it. As they excluded all
from hope of salvation, who were not of their pure precise sect, so
these go not much behind them in their uncharitable censures of
all those who are not of their fraternitie; and as St. <hi>Austine</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
of the <hi>Donatists,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ep. 50. altaria lignea frege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</note> that wheresoever they bore sway, they brake
down the communion tables (which he there metaphorically tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth

just cause to complain of the like out-rages committed by some of
the Zelots of that strain, though some of them of late have not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped
the heavy judgment of God for it.</p>
               <p>For the third sort of <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> they have sunk deeper in the

not only nullifie all baptisme, administred either by Romish
priests, or orthodox Protestants, but condemn baptizing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
simply, which neither the first nor the second sort of <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
did; for both the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donatists,</hi> yea, and <hi>Pelagians</hi>

that election is upon fore-seen faith and repentance; that God

dyed indifferently for all; that a true beleever, who is in the state
of grace, may fall away totally and finally.</p>

That there ought to be a paritie in the church; that the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                        <p>But we answer, First, an example of Christ, or his Apostles
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60443:31"/>
without a precept doth not necessarily binde the Church, as may
be proved by many instances; for Christ washed his disciples feet
before his supper, and he administred it at night, and to twelve
men onely, and no women: yet we are not bound so to do. In
the Apostles dayes widows were maintained to serve the Church
at the publike charge, yet we are not bound to have such. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
the first Christians sold their possessions, and goods, and
parted them to all men, and lived together, and had all things
common, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 44. yet are not we obliged so to do.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, The reason is not alike: at the beginning Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
had no Churches, nor Fonts in them, and therefore they
were constrained to Baptize in such places where were store of
waters:<note place="margin">John 3. 23. <hi>Iohn</hi> Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in <hi>Aenon</hi> neer to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> because there was much water there.</note> besides, the climat of <hi>Iudea</hi> is far better then ours, and
men in riper yeers that were converted to the Christian Faith
were Baptized in great multitudes, and they might without any
danger go into the Rivers, and be Baptized after such a manner:
but now the Gospel having been long planted in these parts, we
have seldome any Baptized but children, who cannot without
danger to their health be Dipt and plunged over head and ears
in the Font, or Rivers, especially if they be infirm children, and
the season very cold, and the air sharp and piercing.</p>
                        <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Obj. 3.</note> They urge the custome of many ancient Churches, in
which a three-fold Dipping was used: and if they Dipt those that
were Baptized three times, it should seem they thought Dipping
very necessary.</p>
                        <p>But we answere,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> First, that what those Ancients did, they had
no precept for it: and if they follow some of the Ancients in
<hi>Dipping</hi> the Baptized, why do they not follow the example of all
the ancient Churches in Christening children?</p>

(they speak of) did it for this end, To expresse the three Persons,
which may as well be done by thrice sprinkling, or washing the
Baptized, as well as thrice <hi>Dipping.</hi> But the truth is, that neither
is requisite, because the Trinity is sufficiently expressed in the very
form of Baptisme, when the Minister saith, <hi>I Baptize thee in the
Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost.</hi>

non-age cannot be taught, yet they may be <hi>made Christs disciples</hi>
by being admitted into his school, their parents giving their
names to Christ, both for themselves and their families. And, in
Christs precept, teaching doth not goe before, but follow Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing,

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Though children in their infancy are not capable
of teaching, or instruction, because therein they must be active
both by apprehending what is delivered to them, and assenting
to the truth thereof: yet are they capable of Baptisme, wherein
they are meerly passive, being washed in the Name of the Trinity,
prayed for, and blessed and received into Christs congregation:
this may fitly be illustrated by Circumcision, which by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God was to be administred to children at the eighth
day, though then they were no way capable of teaching or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
in the Spirituall meaning of that outward signe made
in their flesh: and our Argument drawn from the analogie of
Baptisme and Circumcision, may be truly called, in regard of the
Anabaptists,<note place="margin">Of which see <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>pons asinorum,</hi> a bridge, which these asses could never
passe over; for to this day they could never, not hereafter will be
able to yeeld a reason why the children of the faithfull under the
Gospel are not as capable of Baptisme, as they under the Law of
Circumcision. If they alleadge that these cannot be taught being
but sucklings; neither could they. If they alleadge, that these
know not what is done unto them, nor have any sense at all of
the Sacrament; neither had they, save that they felt the pain of
the knife, as these do the coldnesse of the water, and often shed
tears at their Christening, as the others did at their Circumcising.
If it be further said, That they were of the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the flesh, it may be truly rejoyned, that these are of the
seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to promise, and his children as he is
the father of the faithfull, and so they have the better title of
the two.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, It is no way safe to defer Baptisme till riper yeers, for
by this means millions of children might go out of this world
without the ordinary means of their salvation, which were an
unsufferable, if not a damnable abuse: for though we like not of
that rigid opinion of the schools ascribed to S. <hi>Augustine,</hi> who in
that regard was stiled <hi>durus pater infantum,</hi> that children dying
unbaptized, are necessarily damned; yet we must take heed of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
to the other extream in denying Baptisme to be the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
means of salvation for them, and thereby slighting our

will he punish the child for that which it is no way guiltie of;
yet Gods ordinance ties us, and the parents and governours are
guiltie of a hainous crime before God, who, in contempt of Christs

their childrens baptisme, and thereby deprive them of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

whether male or female, young or old; <hi>that</hi> (saith he) <hi>which

                  <p>Secondly, this regeneration by water Christ speaketh of is to take

to them as well as men. That children are <hi>died</hi> as it were in the

many pregnant texts of holy scripture; as namely, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 5.

                  <p>Lastly, if there were any children in the families, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle

<hi>I baptized also the houshold of Stephanas,</hi> except the sucklings

                  <p>First, in this their answer, either by command they understand
an expresse command, and in particular; or a generall and implicite;
if they mean an expresse command and in particular; such an one is
not requisite, as themselvs (will they, nill they) must needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse:
for, they can produce no expresse and particular commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
either for the baptizing of women, or administring the
Lords Supper to them, or for sanctifying and keeping holy the
eight day from the Creation, or first day of the week, called now
the Christian Sabbath; nor for re-baptizing any that were baptized
in their infancie, which yet the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> generally practise, and
from thence take their names. If they understand a generall and
implicite command; such an one we produced before for the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of children in the prosecution of the first argument, and shall
many other in the arguments ensuing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, where the reason and equitie of law remains, there
the law is still in force, at least for substance, though not for every
circumstance. But the reason and equitie of the law of circumcising
children still remaineth: for nothing can be alledged why children
then should be by circumcision admitted to the church, &amp; not now
as well by baptisme, <hi>hic aqua adversariis semper haeret.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if the children of Christian parents should be excluded
from baptisme, they should be in a worse condition then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of the Jews were under the law; for they, by receiving the

Christ and his church: this promise therefore must necessarily be
understood of his children according to promise, among which
all true beleevers and their children are to be reckoned; and if they
are comprised within the covenant, why should they not receive
the seal of their initiation and admittance thereunto, which was
circumcision, but now is baptisme every way corresponding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?

to their own tenets they are sacraments: and if children were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers

and likewise in Philosophie, that the voice may have an echo by
the repercussion of the aire, but that the echo hath no echo: so

them whom he blessed? If he be the Saviour of young as well as

which is to perswade the Christian husband not to forsake his

where by sanctification the Apostle cannot understand legitimation.
For faith in the husband doth not legitimate the wife, that is, make

                        <p>First,<note place="margin">Obj. 1.</note> they argue from the Scripture negatively, thus: the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
of children hath no warrant in Gods Word; for we find
there no command for it, no example of it, no promise to it: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is to be rejected as an humane invention, and condemned
also as an addition to the Scripture.</p>
                        <p>But we answer,<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> that by the like argument they might prove
that no woman ought to be admitted to the sacrament of the Lords
Supper; for there is no command for womens participation of the
sacrament, nor example of it, nor promise to it in Scripture.<note n="*" place="margin">If they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that <gap reason="foreign">

they answer, that women are comprised under the name of beleevers,
so are children under the name of whole housholds and families,
which are reported in holy Scripture to have been baptized: if
they say further, that by a like reason women are to be admitted to
the sacrament, as men, because Christ dyed as well for them as men,
and they are as wel incorporated into Christs mysticall body as men:
we rejoin in like manner for the same reason that children were
circumcised under the law, they ought to be baptized under the
Gospell. For sith they are comprised in the covenant, why should
not they as well receive the seal thereof set to it in the new law, as
well as the children of the Jews received the seal set thereunto by
the old?</p>

in that great charter <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. 19. 20. saith, <hi>Go teach all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

they would infer that none ought to be baptized but such who are

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60443:39"/>
consequently, that no children ought to be baptized, because they
are not capable of teaching.</p>
                        <p>That the placing the word <hi>teaching</hi> before <hi>baptizing</hi> in that text<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note>

                        <p>Thirdly, they mis-translate the words; for Christ saith, not, <hi>go <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

an faith, and the conversion of whole nations, in which alwayes
the preaching of the word goeth before the administration of the
sacrament. First men are taught to repent of their sins, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
the Articles of the Christian faith, and after they have made
confession of the one, and profession of the other, then they are to
be received into the church by baptisme. This course was taken by
the Apostles in the beginning, and must at this day be taken by
those who are sent into <hi>Turkie,</hi> or the East and West-<hi>Indies,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
<hi>Pagans,</hi> or <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> or unbeleeving <hi>Iews</hi> to the Gospell.
They are to baptize none before they have taught them the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60443:40"/>
of Christian religion; but after the Gospell is planted, and the
parents are beleever<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, and received into the church by baptisme,
their children are first to be baptized, and afterwards taught so
soon as they are capable of teaching.</p>
                        <p>They argue from examples after this manner;<note place="margin">Obj. 3.</note> such are to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
who with the <hi>Iews</hi> in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> Mat. 3. 6. <hi>confesse their sins;</hi> who
with the Proselytes <hi>Act. 2. 41. gladly receive the word;</hi> who with the
<hi>Samaritans</hi> Act. 8. 6. <hi>give heed to the word preached;</hi> who with those
of <hi>Cornelius</hi> familie <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 44. receive the holy Ghost by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the word; who, with <hi>Lydia, have their hearts opened to attend
the things that are spoken by the Apostles,</hi> Act. 16. 14. who with the
Gaoler, <hi>hear the word preached,</hi> and seek after the means of salvation,
<hi>Act.</hi> 16. 30. But children can neither confesse their sins, nor attend
to the word preached, nor actually beleeve nor desire baptisme:
they therefore ought not to be baptized.</p>
                        <p>But we answer,<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> all that can solidly be concluded from these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
is but this in the affirmative; all such who were so qualified
as these were, <hi>viz.</hi> hearers of the Gospell, penitent sinners, and true
beleevers, unfainedly desiring the means of their salvation, ought
to be admitted into the church by baptisme, which we freely grant;
but they cannot conclude from these examples negatively, that
none other ought to be Christened. No more, then it will follow,
that those of <hi>Cornelius</hi> his family received the gift of the holy
Ghost, and spake with divers tongues before they were baptized
with water; therefore none but such who have received such gifts
of the holy Ghost may and ought to be baptized. To confesse sins,
and actually professe faith, makes a man more capable of baptisme:
yet dumb men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who can do neither, if they have a good testmonie
of their life and conversation, and by signs make it appear they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly
desire the sacraments, may receive them.</p>
                        <p>
                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if there be any force at all in an argument drawn from
examples affirmatively, it must be from examples in the like kind;
as from men to men, &amp; from children to children, not from women
to men, or from men to children, or from children to men. For it
will not follow, women in the Apostles times were covered in the
church, therefore men ought to be so: or men may speak in the
church, therefore women may: or children are usually fed with
milk and not strong meat, therefore men in ripers years ought to
use such dyet: no more will it follow, men in riper years, who are
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60443:40"/>
capable of instruction ought to hear the word, to give their assent
thereunto, and enter into a strict covenant with God, to lead a new
life before they have accesse to the Font. Therefore the like duties
are required of children, who have not yet the use of reason, nor
knowledge of good or evill. By this reason they might starve chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
because the law is, <hi>he that will not labour let him not eat.</hi> It
holds in men, but no way in children, who are not able to labour
in any calling by reason of the infirmitie of their joynts, and want
of reason and understanding.</p>
                        <p>Baptisme is a seal of the righteousnesse of faith,<note place="margin">Obj. 4.</note> therefore it
ought to be administred only to beleevers; else we set a seal to a
blank. But children are no beleevers, nor can be while they are
such, because they cannot understand the word nor give assent
thereunto. <hi>Ergo,</hi> children ought not to be baptized.</p>
                        <p>But we answer, that unbeleevers or not beleevers may be either
taken for,<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> first, such as when they hear the word of God, reject it,
or secondly, such who neither have means to hear it, nor desire it;
such unbeleevers are to be excluded from baptisme. For to give
baptisme to such, were worse then to set a <hi>seal to a blank,</hi> it were to
<hi>give holy things to dogs,</hi> and <hi>cast pearl before swine.</hi> Or thirdly, for
such who are born within the precincts of the church, and care is
taken that they shall be taught the principles of faith, as soon as
they are capable thereof. These, though they cannot give yet an
actuall consent to the mysteries of faith, are not to be rearmed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,
or unbeleevers positively, but negatively only; and we ought
in charitie to beleeve, that they will actually beleeve as soon as
they shall have use of reason, and God by his spirit shall open their
hearts to attend to the word preached: to unbeleevers in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sense, as circumcision, the seal of the righteousnesse of faith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the law was given, so may baptisme though not in token of
their present, yet of their future faith.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the children of the faithfull parents whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

                           <hi>ab absurdo,</hi> indeed absurdly after this manner;
<hi>signum frustra datur non intelligenti,</hi> it is a vain and absurd thing to
administer the sacrament to such as know not what it means; as it
is to no purpose to present a beautifull picture to a blind man, or
sound a silver trumpet in a deaf mans eare, or minister physick to
a dead bodie. But children know not what the sacrament means;
when the cold water is powred on them they are offended with it,
and expresse their dislike with crying and tears; therefore it is vain
to christen children.</p>
                        <p>But we answer;<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> in this objection the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> Gyant-like
fight with God. For if there be any force in this argument at all, it
will be as available to overthrow the circumcising of children in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
in the old law by God himselfe, as their baptisme in the
new. For the children among the <hi>Iews</hi> under the law, who were
circumcised the eighth day, knew no more what circumcision
meant, then ours do what baptisme; only they felt the pain of the
knife, as these do the coldnesse of the water, yet were they circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
by Gods expresse command. Will they say that Christ utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
many parables, and wrought many signs and wonders before
his disciples and other of the <hi>Iews</hi> in vain, because at the present
they understood them not, though afterwards they understood
them, and made singular use of them? In like manner dare
they affirm that Christ did in vain lay his hands upon chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
and blessed them, because children knew not what it meant?
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60443:41"/>
or that ministers in vain baptize them, because at that time they
know not what it signifieth, or why it is done?</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it is not in vain to offer to any that which may doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
them good, whether they be sensible of it or no: Physick is mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
to children, naturall fooles, and mad men, to cure them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
in the case they are they have no knowledge what good it
may doe them. A man that is in a swoon hath strong water pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
down his throat, even when he is past sense, and it fetcheth
him again: so though children perceive not what they receive,
yet the sacrament may be and is soveraign unto them for their
soules health.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, though children for the present understand not why <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
they are baptized, and what is undertaken for them, and what fruit
they reap by baptisme, yet order is taken by the Church, that as
soon as they come to yeares of discretion and actuall use of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
they shall understand and be perfectly instructed in this my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie;
and that which is done to them in their infancie, after they
have notice of it will be altogether as beneficiall unto them, as
if they had known it at the time when the sacrament was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred
unto them.</p>
                        <p>They argue from the effects of baptisme;<note place="margin">Obj. 6.</note> baptisme is the <hi>laver
of regeneration,</hi> the <hi>burying of the old man,</hi> the <hi>putting on of Christ,</hi>
the <hi>putting away the filth of the flesh,</hi> with <hi>a confident demanding of
a good conscience.</hi> But children are not regenerated nor renewed
in their mind, nor have buried the old man, nor have put on the
new, nor can confidently demand with a good conscience out of
a certain perswasion of faith: therefore they ought not to be
baptized.</p>
                        <p>But we answer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> the texts of scripture upon which they ground
their argument, namely, <hi>Coloss. 2. 11, 12. Tit. 3. 5. Heb.</hi> 10. 22.
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. contain in them high commendations of baptisme,
but no prohibitions of administring it to children: for all these
effects the Spirit of God produceth in all the elect that are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,
but not all at an instant, but by degrees, as we grow in faith
and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour: they are begun
at our baptisme, but perfected afterwards, unlesse the partie imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
die after baptisme, when no doubt God supplyeth that by
the extraordinarie work of his Spirit; which riper years with the
ordinarie means of faith would have brought forth, if God had
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60443:42"/>
spared them life. Children are regenerated by the impression of
Gods image in their soul, which in processe of time shineth most
bright in them by supernaturall light in the understanding, and
puritie in the heart, and conformitie in their lives to the law of
God: they are also purged from the guilt of their sinnes, and
Christs righteousnesse is imputed unto them, though they have
no sense or feeling thereof till God worketh powerfully upon
their hearts by the preaching of the word, and they apprehend
Christs merits by an actuall faith. As a flower in the winter lyes
hid under ground in the root, which at the spring shooteth forth
the leaves thereof; so in children that are baptized there remaines
that <hi>root</hi> of sanctifying grace in their hearts, which in riper yeares
<hi>putteth forth the leaves</hi> thereof by a holy profession, and <hi>bringeth
forth fruit</hi> by a godly conversation.</p>
                        <p>They argue <hi>à pari;</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Object. 7.</note> if the sacrament of baptisme be to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred

                        <p>But we answer,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that the inference is not good: for though both

it will not follow, that because a punie or novice may or ought
to be admitted to the lowest form in the school of Christ, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he may and ought to be set in the highest: the Lords sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
is strong meat, and not milk, and therefore no fit meat for
sucklings.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the sacrament of the Lords supper was instituted
for the commemoration of Christs death;<note place="margin">

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, before the receiving the Lords Supper every one is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to examine himselfe, which children cannot do. But before
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60443:42"/>
baptisme there is no such examination required. Though if
any in riper years be converted to the Christian faith, it is most re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
that he be examined by the minister who baptiseth him, and
that he be able to give a good account of his faith: but every one
who is fit to be baptized is not presently to be addmitted to the
Lords Table without precedent preparation, and a more strict exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of himself, both concerning his growth in faith, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie
of repentance, and unfained charitie, with an earnest desire
of that heavenly repast.</p>
                        <p>They argue from Christs example,<note place="margin">Obj. 8.</note> who was not baptized till he
was thirtie years of age.</p>
                        <p>But we answer,<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> that Christs example alone without a precept
doth not bind us. For Christ neither instituted nor administred the
holy Supper till the day before his death, and then he both admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
and received it after Supper, and that with his Apostles only:
yet we are not bound, either to defer our receiving to the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our death, or to administer the <hi>Eucharist</hi> after Supper, or to
participate only with such a number, and those Priests or Ministers
of the Gospell.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Christ in his infancie was circumcised, circumcision <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
then being in force; neither was baptisme then instituted, but now
circumcision is abrogated, and baptisme succeeds in the place
thereof.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, though Christ were not baptized in his infancie for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
reasons above alledged, yet was he baptized (if I may so speak) in
<hi>the infancie of baptisme it self.</hi> For, as soon as <hi>Iohn</hi> began to baptize,
Christ came unto him, and required baptisme of him. When the
fulnesse of time was come, in which God had appoynted to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
him to the world, and appoynt him our teacher by a voice from
heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, hear him.</hi>
According to whose example we ought not to defer our baptisme;
but, upon the first opportunitie offered unto us, receive that seal of
our new-birth in Christ and admission into his church.</p>
                        <p>I conclude the answer to this argument with an observation of
<note n="*" place="margin">L. de exord. Anabapt. p. 340 Christus simul circumcisus &amp; baptizatus est, nempe dominus amborum popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum, ideo &amp; sacramenta amborum as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpsit.</note> 
                           <hi>Gastius;</hi> that Christ, because he was Lord both of the people in
the old testament and of them in the new, therefore he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the sacraments of both, and was both circumcised in his

forms, and in all of them not the weight of one solid reason;
the summe &amp; effect of his whole book is contained in the title-page,
wherein he affirmeth, that the christening of children doth <hi>universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppose the commission granted by king Iesus,</hi> Mat. 28. 19. 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.
15. 16. and that <hi>paedobaptisme</hi> is a <hi>popish tradition,</hi> brought into the
church by <hi>Innocentius the third;</hi> upon these two <hi>notes</hi> he <hi>runs in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
through his whole book. The first hath no colour of probabilitie,
and the latter is a grosse &amp; ignorant untruth; if the baptisme of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
<hi>oppose the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission granted by Christ,</hi> Mat. 28. either it opposeth
it in words or in sense: not in words, for there is no mention at all of
children in either of those texts, much lesse any prohibition of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
them, neither doth it oppose it in sense. For the meaning of
our Saviour there apparently is; that his Apostles and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60443:43"/>
should go and convert all Nations, and plant Christian
churches in them: first, teaching them the Gospel and principles
of Christian Religion, and after administring the sacraments unto
them; which they have done accordingly: first, teaching the parents
and baptizing them, and after their children into their faith. But
the objection from these texts is fully answered, and retorted in the
end of the conference and in the solution of the first argument
brought by the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in this section. And therefore I come
briefly to examine his second <hi>assertion</hi> or rather <hi>aspersion</hi> of the
whole Christian world in these words in the frontis-peece of his
book, <hi>Against the anti-christian faction of pope</hi> Innocentius <hi>the</hi> third
<hi>and all his favourites, that enacted by a decree, that the baptisme of
the infants of beleevers should su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ceed circumcision.</hi> These words ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
contain this proposition, that the christening children is the
practise of an Anti-christian faction, which was brought first into
the church by the decree of Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the <hi>third.</hi> Of which
enunciation, I may say as <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth of the Chameleon, <hi>quot co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lores,
tot dolores;</hi> or rather, <hi>quot dicta, tot maledicta;</hi> so many words
as there are, so many grosse errors and scandalous reproaches. For
the baptizing infants is not the practise of a faction, nor a part, but
of the whole, not Anti-christian, but truely Christian church.
Neither was it introduced by <hi>Innocentius</hi> the <hi>third,</hi> but is of far
more ancient date, and was derived even from the times of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
themselvs.</p>
                        <p>First, it is well known that the Greek and Latine churches, or the
Eastern or Western were the <hi>membra dividentia</hi> of the whole
church; and that the christening of infants was approved of and
practised by the Greek church is evident by the testimonies of
<hi>Gregorie Nazianzen, orat. 40. in bap. Origen hom.</hi> 8. upon <hi>Leviti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi>
and 14. of <hi>Luke:</hi> and that it was likewise approved and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Latine church is clearly collected from <hi>Ambrose, lib. de
Abrahamo Patriarcha, Ieron. cont. Pelag. l. 3. Augustin. l. 10. de
Gen. ad lit. c. 23. Cyp. ep. 59. ad Fidum.</hi> Now if the Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
churches were Anti-christian, where were there any Christians
in the world?</p>
                        <p>Secondly. Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, as it is well known to all
the learned, lived in the twelfth age of the Church, and flourished
about the year 1215, in which year he called the great Councell at
<hi>Lateran.</hi> Before him <hi>Gregorie</hi> the great (whom M. <hi>Cornwell</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60443:44"/>
alledgeth, <hi>page</hi> 11. out of M. <hi>Fox</hi> in his book of <hi>Martyrs</hi>)
about the year of our Lord 599. above six hundred yeares before
<hi>Innocentius</hi> the third resolved <hi>Austine</hi> the Monk that in case of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
infants might be baptized as soon as they were born: and
two hundred yeares before <hi>Gregorie,</hi> S. <hi>Austine</hi> wrote a treatise
<hi>de baptismo parvulorum,</hi> and for the lawfulnesse thereof, in his 28
epistle, and in his third book <hi>de pec. mer. &amp; remiss.</hi> and by occasion
elsewhere also alledgeth a testimonie out of S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
who wrote in the year of our Lord 250. nay, which is most
considerable, <hi>Origen</hi> in his Comment upon the epistle to the
<hi>Romans, c. 6. l.</hi> 5. (quoted by M. <hi>Cornwell</hi> himself, <hi>p.</hi> 10.) affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
in expresse tearms, that the church from the Apostles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a tradition to baptize children: whence I thus frame
my argument.</p>
                        <p>All Christians ought to hold the traditions which have been
taught them by the Apostles, either by word or epistle,
2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
                        <p>But the baptizing of children is a tradition received from
the Apostles, as <hi>Origen</hi> affirmeth, <hi>loc. sup. cit. &amp; Austine, l.</hi> 10.
<hi>de Gen. ad lit. c. 23. &amp; de bap. cont. Donatis. l.</hi> 4.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Ergo,</hi> the baptizing of children ought to be retained in the
Christian church.</p>
                        <p>Thus M. <hi>Cornwell</hi> hath <hi>spun</hi> a fair <hi>thred,</hi> of which a strong <hi>cord</hi>
may be made to <hi>strangle</hi> his own assertion.</p>
                        <p>Yea, but M. <hi>Cornwell</hi> chargeth all ministers deeply to answer
this his negative demonstration, saying, <q>O that the learned
<hi>English</hi> ministerie would informe me, lest my bloud like <hi>Abels</hi>
crie aloud from heaven for vengeance, for not satisfying a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
conscience: how shall I admit or consent to the admittance
of the infant of a beleever to be made a visible member of a
particular congregation of Christs body, and baptized, before
it be able to make confession of its faith and repentance, lest I
consent to separate what God hath joyned together?</q>

                  <p>This argument is so far from a demonstration, that it is not so
much as a topicall syllogism, but meerly sophisticall; therin any
who hath ever saluted the University, and hath bin initiated in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,
may observe a double fallacy.</p>
                  <p>The first is <hi>fallacia homonymiae</hi> in the premises.</p>
                  <p>The second is <hi>ignoratio elenchi</hi> in the conclusion.</p>
                  <p>First, the <hi>homonymia</hi> or ambiguity is in the tearm (<hi>joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>)
for the meaning may be either that faith and baptism are <hi>joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together in praecepto,</hi> in Christs precept, and that no man denieth:
all that are commanded to be baptized, are required to believe, and
all that believe, to be baptized, or <hi>joyned together in subjecto,</hi> that
is to say, all who are baptized have true faith, and that none have
true faith but such as are baptized; in this sense it is apparantly
false, and none of the texts alledged prove it, for the thiefe on the
crosse had faith, yet not the baptism we speak of; as also the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
whom S. <hi>Ambrose</hi> so highly extolleth in his funerall, and
many thousands besides; again, <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata, and all
other, who after they came to years renounced their baptisme
and Christian profession, had baptisme, yet no true faith; which,
as M. <hi>Cornwell</hi> himself will confesse, cannot be lost totally or
finally.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in the former syllogisme there is <hi>ignorantio elenchi,</hi>
he concludes not the point in question, they who most stand for
the baptizing of children will not have faith and baptisme severed:
for they baptize children into their fathers faith, and take sureties
that when they come to yeares of discretion they shall make good
the profession of the Christian faith which was made by others at
the font in their name, and for them: nay, so farre are they from
excluding faith from infants that are baptized, that they beleeve
that all the children of the faithfull, who are comprised in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with their fathers and are ordained to eternall life, at the
very time of their baptisme receive some hidden grace of the
Spirit, and the seeds of faith and holinesse, which afterwards beare
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60443:45"/>
fruit in some sooner, in some later. Neither is this any paradox
or new opinion: for S. <hi>Ierome advers. Lucifer.</hi> and <hi>Austin ep.</hi> 57.
<hi>ad Dard.</hi> and <hi>Zanchius de tribus Elohim</hi> affirm, <q>that the holy
Spirit moveth upon the waters of baptisme, and that as the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in <hi>Genesis</hi> 1. 2. rested upon the waters, <hi>incubabat aquis,</hi> that
he might cherish and prepare them for the producing of living
creatures; so the holy Ghost resteth upon the waters of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
and sits <hi>as is were abroad</hi> upon them, and blesseth them,
and thereby doth cherish the regenerate and animate the elect.</q>

here the mysticall ablution takes away. And again, Christ was
made a man of our nature, that we might be made partakers
of his divine nature; the birth or originall which he took in
the Virgins womb he hath put in the font of baptisme; he
hath given that to the water which he gave to his mother; by

of their persons, but the <hi>confutation</hi> of their errors, two whereof
<hi>A. R.</hi> undertaketh strenuously to defend.</p>
            <p>The first is the necessitie of dipping in baptisme: <hi>dipping</hi> (saith
he) in his title-page <hi>is baptizing;</hi> and <hi>baptizing dipping:</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 8.
<hi>the institution of Christ requireth that the whole man be dipped all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in water.</hi> This he endeavoureth to prove out of <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 8. and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60443:46"/>
               <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 26. and Plutarch l. de superstitione, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and <hi>Act. 11. 16. c. 8. 38. 39. Philip and the Eunuch went
down both into the water,</hi> and <hi>Mat. 3. 16. Christ went with Iohn into
the water, p.</hi> 11. and <hi>Col. 2. 12. buried with him in baptisme,</hi> and
<hi>Rom. 6. 4. 5. were buried with him by baptisme into his death.</hi> Now
<hi>let any man</hi> (saith he) that is <hi>not quite fallen out of his reason judge
whether washing or sprinkling the face with water, or dipping the whole
man into water, doth answer all these texts of scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, this is a weak and childish fallacie. For, <hi>ex particulari
non est syllogizari,</hi> no man in his right wits will conclude a generall
from a particular, as he doth here. Some men that were baptized
went into the river, therefore all that be baptized must do so! The
word <hi>baptizo</hi> sometimes signifieth to dip,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> therefore it alwayes signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
so! Although in the places alledged the preposition <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifieth
not <hi>in,</hi> but <hi>with;</hi> as the words immediatly following, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
make it plain, and therefore both the <hi>Geneva</hi> and the last tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation
render the words, not, <hi>I have baptized you in water, but he
will baptize you in the holy Ghost;</hi> but, <hi>I have baptized you with water,
and he will baptize you with the holy Ghost.</hi> And in the 19. of the
<hi>Rev. 21. ver.</hi> it is in the originall <gap reason="foreign">

that is word for word, they were slain in the sword, yet must it be
translated they were <hi>slain with the sword,</hi> not in the sword. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
I grant, that Christ and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> were baptized in
the river, and that such baptisme of men, especially in the hotter
climates, hath been, is, and may lawfully be used: yet there is no
proof at all of dipping or plunging, but only washing in the river.
But the question is, whether no other baptizing is lawfull; or
whether dipping in rivers be so necessarie to baptisme, that none are
accounted baptized but those who are dipt after such a manner;
this we say is false, neither do any of the texts alledged prove it.
It is true, dipping is a kind of baptizing, but all baptizing is not
dipping.<note place="margin">Mar. 3. 111 Act. 1. 5. Act. 2. 3. Mar. 7. 1. 1 Cor. 10. Mar. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dipt into it: tables and beds are said in the originall to be <hi>baptized;</hi>
that is, washed, yet not dipt. The <hi>Israelites</hi> in the wildernesse were
<hi>baptized with the cloud,</hi> yet not dipt into it: the children of <hi>Zebedee</hi>
were to be <hi>baptized with the baptisme of blood</hi> wherewith our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
was baptized,</hi> yet neither he nor they were dipt into blood.
Lastly, all the fathers speak of the baptisme of tears wherewith all
penitents are washed, yet there is no dipping in such a baptisme.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60443:47"/>
As for the representation of the death and resurrection, that is not
properly the inward grace signified by baptisme, but the washing
the soul in the laver of regeneration, and cleansing us from our sins.
However, in the manner of baptisme, as it is administred in the
church of <hi>England,</hi> there is a resemblance of death and the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
For, though the child he not alwayes dipped into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(as the rubrick prescribeth, save only in case of necessitie)
which would be dangerous in cold weather, especially if the
child be weak and sickly: yet the Minister dippeth his hand into the
water, and plucketh it out when he baptizeth the infant.</p>
            <p>The second error of the <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> which <hi>A. R.</hi> strenuously
propugneth, is their decrying down <hi>paedo baptisme,</hi> and with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Christs lambs from being bathed in the sacred Font. This
foul error, or rather heresie (for it is condemned for such both by
the primitive and the reformed churches) he endeavoureth to
blanch in part, if not to quite clear from all aspersion, and justifie
by four arguments which I will propound in his own words, that
he may not say, <hi>I shoot his arrows without their heads:</hi> the first I

               </p>
               <p>This argument stands as it were upon two legs, and both of
them are lame; the one is, that nothing may be done in the worship
of God without expresse command in Scripture. This is an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
and erroneous assertion. For first, there is no expresse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in Scripture for beleeving and acknowledging <hi>in terminis</hi>
three Persons in the unitie of the deitie; and yet <hi>Athanasius</hi> faith in
his <hi>Creed,</hi> that whosoever beleeveth not, and <hi>worshipeth not the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60443:47"/>
there is no expresse command in Scripture to confesse the holy
Ghost, to proceed from the Father and the Son, <hi>tanquam</hi> distinctis
personis: yet it is not only an article of religion in the church of
<hi>England,</hi> but also set down in the confession of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
printed. Thirdly, there is no expresse precept for the abrogating
of the Jewish sabbath, and religious observing the Christian: yet
no <hi>Anabaptists</hi> hold themselvs bound to keep holy the Saturday or
Jewish sabbath; neither have they yet (to my knowledge) op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned
the observation of the Lords day. Fourthly, there is no
expresse precept in Scripture for womens receiving the sacrament
of the Lords Supper. For though the word <gap reason="foreign">

sectaries upon record, no not the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> themselvs exclude
women from the holy Communion. Fifthly, there is no expresse
precept for re-baptizing those who in their infancie were baptized
by a lawfull minister, according to the form prescribed by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Son; and of the holy Ghost;</hi>

either immediatly or mediatly, either in particular or in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
either in plain or direct tearms, or in the true sense of the
text: so, I grant, all the four former orthodox tenets may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

               <p>The other leg also upon which his argument standeth is as lame
as the former. For the baptisme of infants no way over-throws or
prevents the baptizing of any disciples or beleevers instructed in
the mysteries of salvation, of whom the texts alledged are meant;
but there-baptizing of such who were before baptized in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie
(which re-baptizing is no where commanded in Scriptures:)
and as, if all nations were converted to the Christian faith, there
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60443:48"/>
needed no more conversion, so, if all were admitted to the church
by baptisme in their infancie, they should need no other admission
by re-baptizing them; but there will be alwayes some to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted

                  <p>This argument is fallacious and childish, called in the schools
<hi>fallacia accidentis,</hi> as when a Sophister argueth on this wise, <hi>If thou
didst eat that which thou boughtest in the market, thou didst eat raw flesh;
but thou confessest thou didst eat what thou bought'st, therefore by thine
own confession thou didst eat raw flesh.</hi> The argument is captious and
fallacious, wherein the Sophister subtily argueth from the subject
to the accident, from the substance to the circumstance: it is true,
he ate what he bought in substance or kind, were it flesh or fish, but
not in what qualitie or condition he bought it; for he bought it
raw, he are it rost or boyl'd: in like manner M. <hi>Bradbourn</hi> fallaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
argued before the High Commission for the observation of
the Saturday or Jewish sabbath. What the <hi>Iews</hi> were commanded
in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ourth commandement, that we Christians are bound to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
But the <hi>Iews</hi> were commanded to keep holy the seventh
day from the Creation; therefore we Christians are bound to keep
that day. In this syllogisme, as the former, there is <hi>fallacia acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi>
For the Sophister (as I noted before) argueth from the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to the circumstance, from the same day <hi>specie,</hi> to the same
day <hi>numero</hi> in the week. It is true, we Christians are bound by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of that command to appoynt a certain day for the publike ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of God, and no lesse then one in seven, or a seventh day every
week: yet are we not bound precisely to keep that seventh day, <hi>viz.</hi>
from the Creation; which they did. The <hi>Quartodecimani</hi> used a like
Sophisme; if our Easter succeed the Jewish passe-over, then we
ought to keep the fourteenth day precisely as the <hi>Iews</hi> do. But our
Christian Easter doth succeed the Jewish passe-over, therefore
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60443:48"/>
Christians ought to keep their feast of Easter precisely on the
fourth day of the month, whether it fell on the first day of the
week or not. In like manner <hi>A. R.</hi> argueth, <hi>If baptisme succeed
circumcision, then all children ought to be baptized on the eighth day:</hi>
this will not follow, no more then that children ought to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
in the same part where they were circumcised. The answer is
very easie, the one sacrament is to succeed the other in substance,
but not in each circumstance; their circumcision was expressely
confined to the males and to the eighth day, so is not baptisme.
Only it will follow, that because circumcision was administred to
the infant as soon as it was capable thereof, or could receive the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
without danger; therefore children ought to be baptized
as soon as conveniently they may. And this is agreeable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
of S. <hi>Cypr.</hi> 1400. years ago in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Fidus,</hi> and of
a Councell held at <hi>Africk</hi> in his dayes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The third argument I find <hi>p.</hi> 25. None may be warrantably

                  <p>Though the sinews of this Argument have been cut before, and
the texts alledged answered, yet for the further satisfaction
of the reader I further adde.</p>
                  <p>First, that none are required to manifest and declare their faith
before baptisme but such who have been taught, and have use both
of reason and speech. For the rule of the schools, <hi>nemo tenetur ad
impossibile,</hi> holdeth in all sacramentall acts as well as others: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can they hence infer, that children therefore ought not to be
baptized, because they can make no declaration of their faith; no
more then it will follow, that children ought not to eat because
they cannot labour for their living. For though the Apostles rule be
generall,<note place="margin">2 Thess. 3. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Let him not eat that will not labour:</hi> yet all agree it must
be understood of such as are able to labour; so likewise all the texts
of Scripture which require confession of faith must be understood of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60443:49"/>
such who have the use of reason, and of the tongue wherewith
they may confesse.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, children make profession of their faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
both at their baptisme by their sureties; and if they live to
years of discretion in their own persons.</p>

                  <q>The last argument I find <hi>p.</hi> 30. The administration of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
which over-throws the vese nature of the covenant of
grace, and whole Gospell of Christ, is Anti-christian and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable.
But the administration of baptisme upon infants doth
so, because it stands upon the ground and interest which they
have in the covenat (by naturall generation only, or by the meer
profession of faith in the parents or sureties) without faith in
their own persons, whereby faith is made void and the promise
(which is the Gospell and object of faith) is also made of none
effect, and so the preaching thereof becomes uselesse and vain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,

               </p>
               <p>

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>Here is thunder without lightning, thundering in the conclusion;
the baptisme of infants is anti-christian &amp; abominable: but no light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in the premises, no proof at all that the christening children o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthroweth
the nature of the covenant of grace &amp; the whole Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
of Christ. For that which is built upon the covenant of grace,
to wit, <hi>I will be thy God, and the God of thy seed,</hi> and is nothing else
but the setling to the seal of the covenant of grace upon pre-sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of faith present or future in the person of him that is
baptized, can be no over-throwing of that covenant, but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
and establishing it rather. If we taught that children were
heirs of the covenant by the law, then, as the Apostle teacheth us,
<hi>we should make faith void, and the promise of none effect.</hi> But now,
sith we teach, that <hi>Abraham,</hi> the father of the faithfull, and all his
seed are heirs of the kingdom of heaven, not through the law, but
through the righteousnesse of faith: we confirm the covenant of
faith, and in the christening of children accomplish the promise,
<hi>Act. 2. 39. The promise is to you and your children, and to those that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60443:49"/>
are afar off, and to as many as the Lord shall call</hi> by the ministerie of
the Gospell into his church. Yea, (but saith he) the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of baptisme upon infants stands upon the ground and interest
which they have in the covenant by naturall generation only, or by
the meer profession of faith in their parents, and sureties without
faith in their persons. This is a false charge, we teach no such
thing, but that children have interest in the covenant by vertue of
Gods promise above mentioned, and not without faith in their
own persons as [without] may signifie the exclusion of faith,
though without actuall profession of faith in their own persons,
which at the present they cannot do, but as soon as they come to
the use of reason and years of discretion they actually do it, and
thereby make the promise made for them by their sureties
effectuall.</p>

                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 2.</note> Christ christened none, neither men nor children, as Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth us, but his disciples only. If therefore an argument
drawn from his example negatively were of any force, it would
conclude as well against baptizing men in riper yeares as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
for certain it is, Christ baptized neither the one nor the
other.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, these children were not brought to Christ that he
should baptize them, but that he should touch them, and that he
did; for he layd his hands upon them, and blessed them, and his
blessing them was as effectuall to their salvation as if he had chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened
them: for Christs grace dependeth not upon the vertue
of the sacrament, but contrarily, the vertue of the sacrament upon
his grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, when Christ said, <hi>to such belongeth the kingdome of God,</hi>
he necessarily included children, whom he propounds as patterns
to men; and his meaning is, <hi>to children, and to such as are so quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
as children, belongeth the kingdome of God.</hi> If he meant other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
his reason had been of no force, <hi>suffer children to come unto
me, and forbid them not,</hi> because to men in riper yeares (that are
humble and innocent like infants) <hi>belongeth the kingdome of God.</hi>
What is the innocencie or humilitie of men in riper yeares that
can make profession of their faith to children? Or what are they
advantaged thereby, that for this qualification in them infants and
sucklings should be brought to Christ? The coherent sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
must needs be this, <hi>Bring little children to me, for to them,</hi> and
such as are like them, <hi>belongeth the kingdome of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they who have their agents in heaven, certainly belong
to that kingdome; but the children of the elect have their agents
in heaven:<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of my father which is in heaven.</hi> The children of the godly must
either belong to the kingdome of God or the kingdome of Satan;
and when they die, either goe to life eternall, or into everlasting
torments: there is no third place after this life; either to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
they must, or hell: if to heaven as belonging to the kingdome
of God, why is the gate of entrance into it lockt up against them
here? if to hell, then all the children of the faithfull that die before
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60443:50"/>
they can make actuall profession of their faith, even those sweet
babes which suffered in Christs quarrell, and were butchered by
<hi>Herod,</hi> whose feast the Church hath celebrated for 1300 yeares at

                  <p>Secondly, whereas they who stand for the baptizing of children,

                  <p>Secondly, in the word <hi>seed</hi> used in <hi>Genesis</hi> and <hi>Esay</hi> children
are necessarily implyed; not only because all the posteritie of the
faithfull that live in riper years were children, but because millions
of them dye in their infancie before they come to mans estate;
and dare any exclude them all out of the covenant?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by seed in <hi>Genesis</hi> it may be demonstrated that infants &amp;
sucklings were necessarily understood as well as men in riper years;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60443:51"/>
for infants by Gods command received the seal of the covenant,

                  <p>Fourthly, though in the second of the <hi>Acts</hi> there is mention

we insist upon <hi>v.</hi> 39. is not meant of those extraordinarie

few in comparison, and that in the plantation of the Gospell, and
for a few years or at most ages after, whereas the promise which
the Prophet here speaketh of was to be accomplished in all. <hi>To you</hi>
(saith S. <hi>Peter) is the promise made, and to your children, and to all that

that passage of the Apostle 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. is much insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
(<hi>For the unbeleeving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving

but now are they holy</hi>) &amp; that for verie good reason. For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
argument concludes, that some holinesse redounds to the
children by the unbeleeving wives cohabition with her husband,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60443:52"/>
being a beleever; or of the unbeleeving husband with a wife that
is a Christian. Now the question is, whether inward <hi>holinesse</hi> or
outward, that which some call <hi>federall holinesse,</hi> the Apostle cannot
mean inward holinesse; for the beleefe of the father or mother
cannot infuse or produce such holinesse in the infant: and if the
Apostle speak of this outward or federall holinesse, and his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, that the unbeleeving wife is so farre sanctified to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
as to bring forth a holy seed to him, that is, children be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the common-wealth of <hi>Israel,</hi> and having a title to

                  <p>Secondly, if the Apostle meant no more by holinesse but le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimation,
he had no way resolved the <hi>Corinthiant</hi> scruple, which
was, whether according to the law of God, and the example of
the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Ezra,</hi> they were not to put away their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60443:52"/>
unbeleeving wives and children: the Apostle answereth no, because
their children begotten &amp; born by them should be no bastards,<note place="margin">Such marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were then forbidden, yet were they marriages and not nullities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note>
as they expound the word holy. This answer could give them no
satisfaction at all, for the children that were born or begotten by
the <hi>Iews,</hi> who had married strange wives in the days of <hi>Ezra</hi>
were not bastards, being born in wedlock, yet they were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to put them away and their mothers.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that cannot be the meaning of the Apostle which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
untruth, for the Apostle wrote inspired by the Spirit of truth;
but it is not true, that all those children are unclean, that is, as they
interpret, bastards, that come of unbeleeving parents: for
though either or both the parents were infidels, yet, if the children
were begotten &amp; born in lawfull wedlock, they were no bastards; &amp;
noman doubteth but there may be lawful wedlock between infidels.
For marriage is <hi>de jure naturae,</hi> and adulterie among the heathen
was a crime; but if the heathen marriages were no marriages,
then there could be no adulterie among them, for adulterie is the
defiling of the marriage bed.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the main scope of the Apostle in this place was to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the beleevers among the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to cohabit with their
wives that were willing to live with them, though they were yet
unbleevers: not only because they might conceive good hope of
their conversion by their loving and Christian conversation with
them, but because thereby their children should acquire some <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</hi>
But if the children of beleeving parents should not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the communion of Saints, and congregation of the
faithfull by baptisme, their children should gain nothing by their
fathers or mothers faith, but rather lose. For if they remained
still in their Judaisme, not beleeving in Christ: yet their children
were to receive the outward seal of the covenant, to wit, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,
whereby they were reckoned among Gods people, and had
such outward federall holinesse as that sacrament might give them.
Sith therefore this glosse of the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> no way agreeth with
the scope and intention of the Apostle, nor with the truth it selfe:
it remaineth that we admit of that interpretation which the best
of the ancient and latter Expositors give of the text; to wit,
(the unbeleeving husband is so far sanctified by the faith of the
wife, and the unbeleeving wife by the faith of her husband) that
their children thereby are entitled to the covenant of grace;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60443:53"/>
and therefore the Ministers of God have a good ground and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to administer baptisme unto them, which is the seal of their
entrance into that covenant.</p>

                     <p>What God appointed in the old testament, as appertaining

                     <p>But set forms of blessing, thanks-giving, and prayer, were

The assumption or <hi>minor</hi> proposition is confirmed by the expresse

                  <head>ANABAP. ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>The forms mentioned in holy Scripture were composed by those that
were prophets, and immediatly inspired by the holy Ghost, such are not
the composers of our liturgies; and therefore the argument will not
follow from the one to the other.</p>

                  <head>REPLY.</head>
                  <p>First, the question is not now, whether we ought to use no form
but such as is immediately inspired by the holy Ghost, but whether
set or stinted formes, either inspired or not inspired, may or ought
to be used in the church: that they may, we prove by Gods own
command, which must not be restrained to prayers immediately
inspired, and dictated by the holy Ghost; for then none should
pray but Prophets: and by that reason as none that are not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
inspired might use set forms of prayers, so neither concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
or <hi>extempore</hi> prayers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, though none now pray by immediate inspiration, yet
we have now <hi>the spirit of supplication,</hi> and we pray by the assistance
of the holy Spirit; and if our prayers in matter and form are
agreeable to Gods word, they are acceptable unto him: and they
cannot be unacceptable unto him <hi>hoc nomine,</hi> for that they are
delivered in set formes, because God himself was the first au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of them, and hath left them in scripture for our direction
and imitation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:60443:54"/>
Thirdly, in our <hi>Liturgies</hi> a great part of the formes of prayer
and thanksgiving used by us are formes composed by prophets
immediately inspired by the holy Ghost, as namely, the <hi>Lords
Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Magnificat,</hi> the <hi>Benedictus, Nunc
dimittis;</hi> and the close of all our prayers, <hi>The grace of our Lord
Iesus Christ,</hi> &amp;c. Why then doe they not at the least joyn with us
in rehearsing these set formes? If these may be rehearsed without
quenching or restraining the Spirit, why may not others also
framed according to these patterns?</p>
                  <div type="argument">
                     <head>ARGUMENT II.</head>
                     <p>
                        <q>Whatsoever the prophets and saints of God practised in</q>
the substantiall worship of God under the law, may and ought

                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> their practice may and ought to be a president for us.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>major</hi> or first proposition needs no proof, because the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of Gods worship is the same under the Law and under the

they did or spake as they were moved by the holy Ghost, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.
21. The assumption or <hi>minor</hi> is abundantly proved by manifold al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations
out of the old Testament, as namely, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10. 35, 36.
<hi>And it came to passe, when the Ark set forwards, that Moses said,
rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered, and let them that
hate thee flee before thee; and when it rested, he said, Returne, O
Lord, unto the many thousands of Israel:</hi> and 1 <hi>Chron. 25. 6, 7. All
these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the
Lord, with Cymbals, Psalterie, and Harps for the service of the house of
God, according to the Kings order to Asaph, Ieduthun, and Heman: so
the number of them with their brethren that were instructed in the songs
of the Lord was</hi> 288. And 2 <hi>Chron. 29. 30. Moreover, Hezekiah the
king and the princes commanded the Levites to sing prayses to the

were sung in order as the priests went up those fifteen steps. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we may adde a passage out of the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Chronicle; <hi>Postea

and prayers which were ever used with their sacrifices, for before every
of their severall sacrifices they had their severall songs still used in those
times of peace; all which accurately written were transmitted to the
subsequent generations from the time of the Legat MOSES untill this
day by the ministerie of the high Priest.</hi> Long after <hi>Moses,</hi> in the
dayes of <hi>Ezra,</hi> set forms of prayer were prescribed and used in the
Synagogue of the <hi>Iews,</hi> whereof <hi>Maimonides</hi> yeelds this reason;

                  <p>It cannot be denied, that in the time of the old Testament set and
stinted forms were used, but the case is different with us; for under the
Gospel we have more light of knowledge and many speciall gifts of the
Spirit which they had not: they were in their non-age, and as children
used these forms like <hi>festra's,</hi> which they that can read perfectly cast
away; or as those that learn to swim make use of bladders, which they

other errours that crept into that Church: but they are so farre

their Sermon or after with this prayer, conceive that it ought
not only to beset before us as a pattern when we pray, but also to be
used as a prayer. Neither are the reasons to the contrarie of any
weight: for though it be Scripture, that doth not conclude it to be
no prayer. For the prayers of <hi>Moses, Hannah, Deborah, Solomon,
David,</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> are set down in holy Scriptures, and are part of
the inspired oracles of God, yet they cease not to be prayers; and
though in the Lords Prayer all the particular wants of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are not expressed,<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>William Perk.</hi> upon the Lords Prayer, <hi>pag.</hi> 34<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are expressed, to which the other may be with great facilitie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by our selvs, and referred to the proper heads in the Lords
Prayer.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>hos suo jugulamus gladio,</hi> we may give them a wound
with their own <hi>dudgeon dagger,</hi> for if they grant it to be the pattern
of all Prayers, it followeth that it, is the perfectest of all prayers;
and certainly if we may use prayers of our own, which are more
imperfect, much more may we use this which is a most absolute
and perfect one. If a Scrivener set a most perfect copie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
comprise in certain sentences not only all the letters of the
Alphabet, but all the combinations and conjunctions of them, none
doubteth but that the schollers may both write other sentences ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that pattern, and in the first place write those verie sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
in the copie, &amp; endeavour to come as near as they can to the
originall. Such is the Lords Prayer, a perfect copie to write by,
comprising in it all things needfull for a Christian to pray for:
first therefore we are to write it, and then to write after it, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
our writing by it; and though we speak with the tongue of
men and Angells, yet certainly our prayers cannot be so acceptable
to God as when we tender them unto him in his Sons own words.
For this end saith that blessed <hi>Martyr</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi>

                     <p>What the Christian church hath generally practised in all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and places in the worship of God, ought not to be thought
as erroneous or swerving from the rule of Gods word.</p>
                     <p>But the Christian church generally in all ages, and in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
hath made use of publike, set, and sanctified forms of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as appeareth by the Liturgies yet extant, whereof some
bear the names of the Apostles, as S. <hi>Iames</hi> and S. <hi>Peter;</hi> some
of the Greek fathers, as that of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and S. <hi>Basil;</hi>
some of the Latine fathers, as <hi>Ambrose, Gregorie,</hi> and
<hi>Isidore,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ergo,</hi> set forms of prayers are not erroneous, or swerving

and universalitie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that these Liturgies are Apochryphall: and though in lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
times the use of Liturgies came in, yet the purer and more ancient
times used no such <hi>crutches</hi> to support their lame devotion; for <hi>Justine

                  <p>First,<note place="margin">As I have shewed else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>lib. cui titulus,</hi> Romes Ruine.</note> the <hi>Papists</hi> pretend to antiquitie, and make their brags of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versalitie;
but in truth they have neither. An argument drawn
from a shadow of truth vanisheth like a shadow, but an argument
drawn from a true bodie is substantiall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the strength of the argument lieth not in bare anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,
and the universalitie of this practice, (for we know many
errors are ancient, and some abuses verie far spreading,) but in the
nature and condition of the Catholike Christian church, to whom
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60443:57"/>
Christ hath promised his <hi>perpetuall presence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 20.</note> and the <hi>guidance of his

church, taken formally for the whole companie of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,<note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note>
hath ever been kept by vertue of Christs promise from
falling into any dangerous errour, especially for any long
time.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Because they except against the Liturgies found in the
writings of the ancient fathers; in which, though I grant there
are some prints of noveltie, yet there are foot-steps also of true
antiquitie: I will wave them for the present, and by other good
testimonies prove the constant and perpetuall use of Service, or
Common-Prayer-Books.</p>
                  <p>To begin with the first age, from the ascension of our Lord to
a hundred years,<note place="margin">Pres. Liturg.

                     <hi>Victorius Sciaticus Maronita,</hi> in his preface to
those three Liturgies he put forth, saith, that the <hi>Bishops, both of
the Eastern and Western churches made some alteration upon good
ground</hi> in those Liturgies <hi>which they received from the Apostlei.</hi>
If this mans credit cannot carrie so great a cause; yet certainly
<hi>Hegesippus</hi> his testimonie, a most ancient writer, bordering upon
the Apostles time, ought not to be slighted, who writeth of
S. <hi>Iames,</hi> chosen Bishop of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> by the Apostles themselvs, that
in regard of a form of Service, or Common-Prayer-Book made
by him for the use of the church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he was stiled <hi>Iacobus
Liturgus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the second age, <hi>Iustine Martyr,</hi> in his second apologie,
which he wrote to <hi>Antoninus</hi> the Emperour, acquainteth us with

consisting of many excellent treatises against the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
divers passages out of the Common-Prayer then used by
the church to convince those hereticks of the noveltie, as well as
falshood of their tenets. For notwithstanding that the <hi>Pelagians</hi>
were furnished with many testimonies of the ancient Doctors, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
of the Greek church, <hi>qui ante exortum Pelagium securius lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuti

freedome of mans free will by nature</hi> (in opposition to the <hi>Manichees,</hi>
who taught a fatall necessitie of sinning) then could well stand with
the free grace of Christ accurately defended by S. <hi>Austine</hi> and his
scholars; yet this learned and zealous father, being most expert in
the prayers appoynted to be read in the ancientest Christian chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
out of them exceedingly confounded these upstart hereticks,
and proved a full consent of antiquitie for those Orthodox tenets
he propugned against all the enemies of Christs free and saving
grace: and truly at this day a man may more certainly gather out
of the Book of Common-Prayer, and specially the Collects used
in our Liturgie, what is the judgement of the church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

of Prayer in generall.
OBJECT. 1.</head>
               <head type="sub">No worship devised by man is acceptable to God:
Set forms of prayer are a worship devised by man;
Ergo, set forms of prayer are not acceptable to God.</head>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>First, a worship of God devised by man may be taken in a
double sense, either for a worship wholly devised by man, without
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60443:60"/>
any precept or president in scripture; and such a worship is not
agreeable unto God, but condemned in his word, under the name
of <hi>will-worship:</hi> or for a worship in substance, prescribed by God,
but in some circumstance, manner, or help thereunto devised or
composed by man; and such may be and is acceptable unto God:
as for example, reading scripture is a religious act prescribed by
God, yet the translation of the originall into the mother-tongue,
divisions of the text into chapters and verses, diverse readings, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlinearie
glosses, together with the contents, and fitting them to
the times and seasons, are from man. Preaching is a worship of
God, yet the choyse of such a text, dividing it into parts, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the parts in such a method, raysing doctrines, and applying Uses
from them, are from man, or acts wherein the Preacher maketh
use of his invention, art, and judgement. Catechizing is a dutie
enjoyned by God; yet to use such a form of words or method in
Catechizing by questions and answers, as also the dividing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme
into 52. Sections, answerable to the Sundayes in the year,
as we see in <hi>Calvins</hi> and other Catechismes, is a device and inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of man. In like manner, prayer is a dutie enjoyned by God,
and a part of his substantiall worship, but the set forms are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
by man, yet according to generall rules prescribed in
scripture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, not only prayer it self, but even set forms of prayer
have both precept and example in Gods word, as I proved hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and therefore are not to be accounted a meer humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
although therein mans wit and invention be made
use of.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this argument may be retorted upon the <hi>Anabaptists.</hi>
Forms of prayers upon premeditation, which Preachers use before
their sermons, are as well a worship of mans devising, as the set
forms devised and framed by the governours of the church. But
premeditated or studied prayers made by way of preface before
sermons, are acceptable to God, and allowed by the <hi>Anabaptists</hi>
themselves; <hi>Ergo</hi> set forms of prayer cannot be disallowed.</p>

               <p>None who useth a set form of prayer prayeth by the Spirit.
Every good Christian ought to pray by the Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15.
<hi>Ergo,</hi> no good Christian may use set forms of prayer.</p>

                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>First, the Apostle in the place alledged speaketh of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
gift of the Spirit, as appeareth by the verse immediately
going before: <hi>If I pray in a strange tongue, my spirit prayeth but my
understanding is without fruit.</hi> Now, sith those extraordinarie gifts
of the Spirit are ceased, Christians are not now bound to prophesie,
or <hi>pray by the Spirit,</hi> in the Apostles sense. This text therefore is
impertinently alledged, and maketh nothing against set forms of
prayers now in use in the church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the phrase to pray by <hi>the Spirit,</hi> as it is used by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
may admit of a double meaning; either to pray by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
inspiration of the Spirit, as the Prophets and Apostles, and all
the pen-men of the holy Ghost spake and wrote; and in this sense,
they who use set forms of prayer devised by men, pray not by the
Spirit, as neither doe they who pray <hi>ex tempore;</hi> for then they could
not be out, which they are often, nor commit any errour in their
prayers, which they doe very many; nay, then their prayers should
be of equall authoritie with the <hi>Psalmes,</hi> &amp; other prayers set down in
scripture given by divine inspiration: or by this phrase they mean
to pray by the assistance of the Spirit; and in this sense, they who
use premeditated and penned prayers more pray by the Spirit then
they who use <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayers, conceived and brought forth at the
same instant; for the Spirit assisteth the former both in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditation
and their present deliverie, but the latter only in their
sudden expressions: and I would fain know of them, why they who
preach studied and penned sermons preach by the Spirit, and that
far more accurately, learnedly, judiciously, and powerfully then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
and yet, in their judgements, they who utter studied and
penned prayers pray not by the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this objection may also be retorted by the Apostles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample;
we are as well to sing by the Spirit as to pray by the Spirit,
for so are his expresse words; <hi>I will pray with the Spirit, I will pray
with understanding also; I will sing with the Spirit, I will sing with
understanding also.</hi> But a man may sing by the Spirit, and yet sing
<hi>prick-song</hi> and a written or printed dittie in meeter; for such are the
<hi>Psalmes</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> which they themselves sing: therefore <hi>a man
may pray by the Spirit,</hi> and yet use a set form, and rehearse a penned
or printed prayer.</p>

               <head>OBJECT. III.</head>
               <p>It is not lawfull to confine the spirit, for that is a kind of
quenching it, forbidden by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 19.</p>
               <p>But the prescribing and using set forms of prayers is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
or stinting the spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> the prescribing or using set forms of prayer is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>First, if the governours of the Church should simplie and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
forbid all suddainly conceived, or <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayers in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
or private, they should offend in some degree, and be guiltie
of the breach of that precept of the Apostle. For to stifle all sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
motions of the Spirit, and prohibit all piou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ejaculations is in
some sense <hi>to quench the Spirit.</hi> But albeit they command a set
form of Liturgie to be read in the church, yet they condemn not
the use of conceived or premeditated prayers by preachers in
their Sermons, nor by private Christians in their closets, but leave
them to their Christian libertie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I demand of them, when they object against the use
of set forms of prayer, that they confine the spirit, what Spirit they
mean? the Spirit of God, or their own spirit, the spirit of man?
If the Spirit of God, their objection contains in it blasphemie; for
the Spirit of God cannot be confined by us, whether we pray with
premeditation or without, use a set form or not: the Spirit of God
worketh in both as he pleaseth, both by enlightning the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and warming our affections, and powerfully assisting both in
the conceiving and deliverie of prayer. If they mean their own
spirit, or the spirit of him that prayeth in the congregation, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the minister or preacher. I answer, this is most necessarie that
his spirit for the time be confined, and his intention tied to that
prayer he readeth or saith by heart; neither is this forbidden by the
Apostle, nor is it any quenching of the spirit; but rather a kindling
it. For in uttering zealous prayers with a fixt intention and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout
affection we feel our <hi>hearts burn within us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this objection may also be retorted; if a preacher may not
use a set form of prayer, because the spirit in him is thereby confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
neither may he deliver a conceived or <hi>ex tempore</hi> prayer in the
audience of the people, because by it the spirit in them is confined,
though the prayer of the preacher be no set form to him, but meer
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60443:62"/>
voluntarie and extemporarie yet is it a set form to the hearers: and
their spirit, if they will not suffer their mind to wander, is tied and
confined to it so long as it lasteth, being an home or two according
to the length of our late fast prayers; in which regard none more
confine the spirit in men then these our upstart <hi>Enhusiasts.</hi>

               <head>OBJECT. IV.</head>
               <p>Prayers of the Pastor or Minister ought to be fitted to the
severall occasions of the faithfull.</p>
               <p>Set forms of prayer cannot be so fitted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> they ought not to be used in churches.</p>
               <p>First, this is ignorantly objected by such, who never read either
our books of Common-Prayers or other helps to private devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for in them there are not only generall prayers, fit for all men
to use at all times, but also speciall, applied to severall estates and
conditions of men, for men in sicknesse and in health, in time of
war or in peace, and the like.</p>
               <p>Secondly, these severall occasions they speak of are either such
as concern more in the congregation, or some one only in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
if they concern more, and the preacher be acquainted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
he may either chuse a penned prayer fitting for them, or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
upon premeditation make one; if they concern one only, such
are not fit to be mentioned in publike prayers, but the Pastor is to
repair to them, and applie a salve in private to their peculiar
sore.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this objection may also be retorted: if all things which
we need to pray for upon any occasion whatsoever be contained in
one short set form of prayer, much more may they be in many of
greater length. But all things we need to pray for are comprised<note place="margin">Ang. ep. 121. c. 11.

               <head>OBJECT. V.</head>
               <p>Reading a prayer is no more praying then reading a
prophesie is prophesying, or reading a Sermon is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But where a set form of Liturgie is used, the minister only
readeth certain prayers and collects.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ergo,</hi> he prayeth not, nor is his ministerie therein Divine
Service.</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>First, bare reading a prayer simplie, without any more then lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labour,
is not praying; but reading a religious prayer with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
intention, and affection, is praying and godly devotion.
For what is prayer but a lifting up of the heart to God, with a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
faith and fervant affection, out of a quick sense of our wants,<note place="margin">The definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of prayer.</note>
and calling upon him for such things as are agreeable to his will?
This, whether it be done within book or without book, with
our own words, or borrowed from another, it matter not at
all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the reason holdeth not from praying to prophesying
and preaching; for prophesie is an extraordinarie gift of the holy
Ghost, and preaching a speciall facultie acquired by many years
studie, now especially since the extraordinarie gifts of the Spirit
are ceased; but prayer is a common dutie of all Christians: and
therefore though it will not follow; such a man readeth a prophesie,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> he is a prophet; or readeth written or printed Sermons,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> he is a preacher. Yet we may rightly conclude, such a one
readeth godly prayers constantly, after a religious manner, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he is an humble orator, and petitioner to his heavenly Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie;
for <hi>Christ said to his Apostles, when you pray, say, Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
&amp;c.</hi> Saying therefore, or rehearsing a set form is pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this objection may be thus retorted; if reading the
law in the synagogue be preaching it in the language of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost, then reading holy and heavenly prayers of the church is
praying: but the text saith expressely, that reading the law is
preaching, <hi>Act. 15. 21. Moses of old hath in everie Citie them that
preach him, seeing he is read in the synagogue everie Sabbath day.
Ergo,</hi> reading prayers is praying.</p>

                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:60443:63"/>
The <hi>Anabaptists</hi> having thus disgorged their poyson against set
forms of prayer in generall; the <hi>Brownists, who ingender with them,</hi>
thus spit their venome against the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>

               <div type="answer">
                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>But this exception is weak and false: First, weak; for if all
things in the service of God, wherein mans invention, skill and art
is exercised, are to be rejected and abandoned, what will become of
the partition of the <hi>Bible</hi> into chapters and verses, the translating
it into the mother-tongue, putting <hi>Psalms</hi> into meeter, and setting
tunes to them, <hi>Catechismes,</hi> confessions of faith, forms of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
sacraments, nay, conceived as well as read prayers, and all
commentaries, homilies, and sermons; for all these have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Art, and are the issue of our meditation, invention, and
contemplation? We must therefore of necessitie distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the doctrine and the method of a sermon, the matter and
the form of a prayer, the substance and circumstance of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
in the former there is no place for mans art, wit, or invention;
in the latter there hath been alwayes, and must be. Secondly, it is
false; for the booke of Common-prayer consisteth of, first, confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of sinnes, and of faith; secondly, lessons out of the old and new
Testament; thirdly, thanksgivings or blessings generall and speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;
fourthly, <hi>Psalmes</hi> read and sung; fifthly, prayers for our selves
and for others: but for all these we have precept and president in
scripture, namely, for confession of sinnes, <hi>Psal. 32. 5. I said I will
confesse my transgrlssions to the Lord. Prov. 28. 13. He that covereth
his sinnes shall not prosper, but who so confesseth them and forsaketh them
shall have mercie. Dan. 9. 20. While I was praying and confessing my
sinne and the sinnes of my people. Ezra 10. 1. 11. Now when Ezra
had prayed and confessed, weeping and casting himself down before
God. 11. Now therefore make confession unto the Lord God of your
fathers. Math. 3. 6. And were baptized of him in Iordan, confessing
their sinnes.</hi> For confession of faith, <hi>Math. 10. 32. whosoever shall
confesse me before men, him will I confesse before my father which is in

heaven. Rom. 10. 10. With the heart man beleeveth unto righteousnesse,
and with the mouth confession is made to salvation. 1 Pet. 3. 15. Be
readie alwayes to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason
of the hope that is in you.</hi> For lessons to be read out of the old and
new Testament, <hi>Deut. 31. 11. Thou shalt read this law before all
Israel in their hearing. Esay 34. 16. Seek ye out of the book of the
Lord, and read. Luke 4. 16. He went into the synagogue on the
Sabbath day, and stood up for to read. Acts 13. 15. After the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the Law and the Prophets. Acts 15. 21. Moses being read in
the synagogue every Sabbath day. 1 Tim. 4. 13. Give attendance to
reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</hi> For thanksgivings, <hi>Neh. 11. 17.
And Mattaniah the sonne of Asaph was the principall to begin the
thanksgiving in prayer. Psal. 26. 7. That I may publish with the voyce
of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy woundrous works. Psal. 50. 14. Offer
unto God thanksgiving. Phil. 4. 6. In every thing by prayer and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
with thanksgiving, let your request be made known unto God.
Ephes. 5. 20. Give thanks alwayes. 1 Thess. 5. 18. In every thing give
thanks. For Psalmes</hi> read and sung, <hi>Psal. 95. 1. O come let us sing
unto the Lord. 1 Chron. 16. 9. Sing Psalmes unto him. Ephes. 5. 19.
Speaking to your selves in Psalmes and Hymnes and spirituall songs.
Iam. 5. 13. Is any merry? let him sing Psalmes. Rev. 15. 3. And they

selves and others, 1 <hi>Kings 8. 28, 29, 30, 38. Have respect unto the
prayer of thy servant. Math. 21. 13. My house shall be called the
house of prayer. Luke 18. 10. Two men went up into the Temple to
pray. Acts 3. 1. Peter and Iohn went up together into the Temple at
the houre of prayer. 1 Thess. 5. 17. Pray without ceasing. 1 Tim. 2. 1.

               <head>ANSWER.</head>
               <p>But this exception is first insufficient, secondly ignorant. For if
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60443:64"/>
the prayers in our Service-book are holy and pithie, if agreeable
to the pattern of all prayer, and favour of true pietie and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
(which they cannot denie they doe) what skils it out of what
book they were culled? The <hi>Iews</hi> borrowed jewels of the <hi>Egyptians</hi>

               <p>Secondly, this exception is guiltie of as much ignorance as

                  <hi>of</hi> if they could, they might have discerned the prayers
in our Church-book to be farre more ancient then the <hi>Roman
Missall.</hi> The Bishops and learned Doctors, who in the dayes
of <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt compiled the Service-book at <hi>Windsor,</hi> had
farre more ancient <hi>Liturgies</hi> in their eye then the <hi>Roman Missall</hi>
or <hi>Breviarie;</hi> they drew not water out of that impure channell,
but out of a clearer fountain. There are the same <hi>Epistles</hi> and
<hi>Gospels</hi> in our book and theirs, but they were not taken out of
theirs, but out of the Canonicall books of the old and new
Testament: there are the same <hi>Psalmes</hi> and <hi>Hymnes,</hi> but they
were not taken out of their <hi>Psalter,</hi> but out of <hi>Davids</hi> and
Saint <hi>Luke:</hi> there are many of the same Collects and Orisons,
but they are not taken out of their <hi>Breviarie,</hi> but out of the
<hi>Liturgies</hi> of Saint <hi>Basil,</hi> Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi>
and other more ancient, attributed to the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if in regard of that little which may seem to be
translated out of the <hi>Missall</hi> into our English Service-book,
it might be tearmed, as <hi>Spalatensis</hi> (when he was present at
the Service in <hi>Canterburie</hi> church, called it (<hi>Breviarium optime

prayers for the dead, all <hi>Dirige's</hi> and <hi>Trentals,</hi> and whatsoever
was not warrantable by holy scripture; and, retaining the

               <p>Thirdly, they except at three Popish absolutious, as they
tearme them; the first, in the beginning of the Service after
the publique confession; the second, before the Communion;
the third, in the visitation of the sick.</p>
               <p>But this exception hath in it more strength of passion then rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
for none of these absolutions are absolute, but conditionall;
nor in the name, or by the authoritie of the Minister, but of
Christ.</p>
               <p>The first is nothing but a declaration of Gods mercie, who
freely pardoneth the penitent; and of the Ministers dutie to
declare and pronounce this absolution and remission to the
people.</p>
               <p>The second is a prayer of the Minister to God to have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
upon the Communicants, to pardon and deliver them from
all their sinnes, and to confirme and strengthen them in all
goodnesse.</p>
               <p>The third is the execution of that Ministeriall power

Epistles</hi> and <hi>Gospels</hi> in a corrupt translation, in which there
are many grosse errours: as <hi>Psal, 105. 28. And they were not

And <hi>Galat. 4. 25. Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth

               </p>
               <p>But this exception is of little importance, and may soon be
philipp't away.</p>
               <p>For first, if no translation way be read in the church but
that which is free from all errour, then none at all ought to be
read, for there is none in which there are not some mistakes, more
or lesse: with this <hi>ferula</hi> therefore they rap themselves over the
thumbs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, those sores on which they fasten their nail have their
salves; they may see them, if they please, in <hi>Hooker, Fisher,</hi> and
many others, who have cleared those very passages.</p>
               <p>Lastly, neither is the Minister, nor are the people tyed to that
translation in the common-prayer-book; but they may, if they
please, in stead thereof read the <hi>Psalmes, Epistles</hi> and <hi>Gospels,</hi>
according to the last and best translation: neither were they to

any errour at all in it, which concerneth faith or manners; and

               <p>But this exception is vain, not the repetitions: for,</p>
               <p>First, that is not vain which serves to a holy end and purpose,
the more to stirre up our affections, or imprint such prayers
deeper in our memories; as the reflecting of the sunne-beams
is not in vain which encreaseth the heat thereof, and the striking
again and again upon the same nail is not in vain, because it dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
it in deeper, and more fasteneth it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the holy scripture warranteth such repetitions: for
in the 136. <hi>Psalme</hi> these words, <hi>for his mercie endureth for ever,</hi>
are 27. times repeated in the old translation, but 26. accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

that prayer, <hi>Father, let this cup passe from me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 44.</note> three
times.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is no prayer appointed to be often repeated
save the Lords prayer, which Christ himself twice delivered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
severall occasions; and not only the church of <hi>England,</hi> but
all churches in their <hi>Liturgies</hi> have thought fit to rehearse of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:
for, it is as the salt which seasoneth all our spirituall
sacrifices, as the amber which sweeteneth all our dishes, as
the <hi>Elixar</hi> which turneth all our <hi>leaden conceptions into pure
gold.</hi> In the confession of our sinnes we are defective, as also in
the profession of our faith, and in our prayers for our selvs and
others, and in our forms of consecration of the sacrament: and
therefore in all these places of the Service-book the Lords prayer
is added to supply the defects thereof.</p>

<hi>flame of devotion.</hi>

               <p>But this exception is neither true nor just.</p>
               <p>First, not true; for the prayers appoynted by the church to be
read at solemn fasts, as likewise the prayers <hi>for the whole estate of
Christs church,</hi> and the Morning and Evening prayers <hi>for private
Families,</hi> and for sundrie other purposes printed after the <hi>Psames;</hi>
are of as large a size as any used in any reformed chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is not just; our prayers are thereby no way dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraged,
for the shortest of them come nearer to the pattern of
perfect prayer drawn by our Saviour, then their longest. In all the
Bible there is no example of any verie long prayer: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,<note place="margin">Eccles. 5. 2.</note>

then prayers; neither can they for so great a space of time hold
their attention to the Preacher; neither can their memorie carrie

not a prayer for the dead, but for the living, that God would not

The preposition <hi>By</hi> hath many significations; sometimes it is the

                  <hi>but especially to those of the houshold of faith;</hi>
so we are likewise to pray for all men, because there is no man so
wicked and in so damnable a condition to whom God (for ought
we know) may not give repentance unto life; and we are indebted
unto Gods mercie and restraining grace, that we run not into the

               <p>And as for <hi>women labouring with child,</hi> we pray nothing for them,

                  <p>1. It is true, that the former delinquents were guilty of other
crimes. For as Angels often appeare single, but Devils by legions;
so eminent vertues are for the most part single and rare in men, but
enourmous vices are seldome alone. Yet this no way dulleth the point
of the argument: For the Text is expresse, that the particular punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
above mentioned were laid upon them for those illegall acts
done by them, to the wrong and prejudice of the Sacerdotall function.
For what saith the Text? <hi>Corah and his company said to Moses and
Aaron, You take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy,
every one of them.</hi> Ver. 18. <hi>They took very man his censer, and put fire
on them:</hi> and that hereby they encroached upon the Priests office, it is
evident by <hi>Moses</hi> reproofe, <hi>ver. 9, 10. Is it a small thing that God hath
appointed you to stand before the congregation to minister unto them,</hi> and
<hi>he hath brought thee neere unto him,</hi> and <hi>seek ye the Priesthood also?</hi>
Likewise it is said of <hi>Vzza,</hi> that <hi>he put his hand to the Ark of God,</hi> and
<hi>that therefore the Lord was wroth with him, and smote him in the same
place.</hi> And for <hi>Vzziah,</hi> the case is yet clearer, for the Priests with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
him, and said unto him, 2 <hi>Chron. 26. 18, 19. It pertaineth not
unto thee, Vzziah, to burne incense to the Lord, but to the Priests, the
sonnes of Aaron:</hi> yet <hi>Vzziah</hi> will be medling with the censer, and be
burning incense contrary to the Law, and thereby he incensed the
wrath of God against himselfe, and <hi>immediately the leprosie rose up in

Altar.</hi>

                  <p>Though this assertion of the Anabaptists as they maintaine it, hath a
glosse and varnish put upon it of piety, prudence and justice; of piety,
in preventing all occasion both of false and vaine oathes; of prudence,
in not insnaring our selves; of justice, in not concurring actively to our
own prejudice or wrong: yet upon due examination it will appear to
be repugnant to all three; to piety, by robbing God of a part of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall
worship, to wit, a holy kind of invocation; to prudence, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furnishing
our selves sometimes of our best defence, which is to cleare
our innocency by oath; to justice, by depriving all Courts of justice of
this soveraigne evidence of truth, and all humane society both of the
surest tye of fidelity, and the readiest meanes to end all strife and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie.
For the farther manifestation whereof I am to cleare three
points, 1. That oathes may lawfully be taken by Christians, 2. That
some oathes may be lawfully exacted of them, and imposed upon
them. 3. That oathes may be lawfully urged and exacted not only in
civill, but in criminall causes, such as are commonly tearmed oathes
<hi>ex officio,</hi> when a man is required to answer upon oath concerning
some crime or fault objected to him, or articled against him. Some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it to be lawfull to take any oath, others allow of oathes freely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
but not imposed: a third sort dislike not all oathes imposed, but
only except against oathes <hi>ex officio.</hi> These three questions hang as
it were upon one string. For if no oath may bee lawfully taken, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
none may be lawfully imposed, and if oathes may not be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
least of all the oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> whereby we hazard and endanger
our lives, liberties, limbes or estate if we confesse, but our soules if we
deny upon oath, what is truly laid to our charge. Againe on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60443:73"/>
if the oath <hi>ex officio</hi> in some cases may be lawfully imposed, then
other oathes may be imposed with much lesse difficulty; and if oathes
may be lawfully imposed, certainly they may be lawfully taken. Yet
must these questions of necessity be handled apart, for the satisfaction
of scrupulous consciences, who first must be perswaded of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of taking an oath in generall, before they will suffer an oath to be
imposed upon them: and secondly, that the Magistrate hath a lawfull
power to exact oathes, before they will take such and such a kind of
oath required of them.</p>
                  <p>To lay the foundation therefore firme, before wee build any thing
thereupon. First I prove the lawfulnesse of taking oathes, the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

                  <p>1. The same God is Law-giver both to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and Christians,
and the same truth shineth in the law, and in the Gospell, only with
this difference: in the law it shined through a tiffany or vaile of rites,
and ceremonies: but in the Gospell as it were with open face. The
vaile is now taken away, whereof religious swearing by the name of
God was no part. For an oath containeth not a resemblance of Christ,
but a worship of God. It is no type or sign of grace, but seale of truth,
the sense whereof is meer morall, the law of it naturall, the use perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
the worship performed in it to God is essentiall. When we call
God to witnesse a hidden truth, in the sincerity of our intentions, wee
agnize his Soveraigne greatnesse. For every oath is by a greater, <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 16. we professe his all-seeing wisdome, we invocate his revenging
justice, which are not rituall, but substantiall parts of worship. In
which regard in the texts of the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> above alleadged,
swearing is joyned with the feare of God, and cleaving to him; both
duties of the first table, required by the eternall and morall law of God.</p>
                  <p>2. As we have warrant for swearing in the old Testament, so also
in the new; for Christ himselfe was made our Priest by oath. Heb. 7.
21. <hi>Those Priests were made without an oath, but this with an oath, by
him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not repent, thou art a
Priest &amp;c. By so much was Iesus made a surety of a better Testament.</hi>
God his using an oath for confirmation of Christ his Priesthood war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranteth
the custome of giving, and taking an oath at the Inauguration
of Emperours, Coronation of Kings, Consecration of Bishops, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Ministers, and generally the admission of any person of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
into any place of trust, or command, or weighty charge, in Church
or Common-wealth. God himselfe using this kind of confirmation,
confirmeth this kind and use of an oath. Neither are promissary oathes
only approved by the Gospell, to bind our faith, and assure loyalty and
fidelity, but also assertory, to cleare doubtfull truth, and end litigious
suites; Heb. 6. 16. <hi>For men verily sweare by the greater, and an oath
for confirmation is to them an end of all strife, even Christ himselfe who
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60443:74"/>
is</hi> AMEN, <hi>the faithfull witnesse, and in whom all the promises of God
are yea and</hi> AMEN, often corroborateth his divine Essayes and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

which is virtually, if not formally, an oath according to the strict defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition

creature, was no taking Gods name in vain, because in such oaths Gods
name was not used. This practice of theirs our Saviour condemnes, and
refutes their errour, <hi>Mat. 5. 34. Sweare not at all, neither by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,

of divine worship, to sweare by any creature is to ascribe a deity unto
it, and to commit idolatry. And if the originall be read without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma

evident that Christ in these words forbids not the act of swearing, but
the unlawfull form. But because in some ancient copies there is a colon

                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Obj. 2.</note> the Anabaptists dispute thus, Whatsoever commeth of
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60443:76"/>
evill is sinfull, but all oathes come from evill. (For Christ himselfe
<hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 37. Saith, <hi>Let your communication be yea, yea, nay, nay: for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever

                     <p>But we answer,<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> First, that the Proposition is not currant. All that
commeth from evill, or is occasioned by evill, is not sinfull. For, <hi>Ex
malis moribus bonae nascuntur leges.</hi> The best lawes were enacted upon
ill occasions, and very corrupt manners of men: apparell at the first
came from evill, <hi>viz.</hi> shame for sin, and singular Antidotes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
were found by occasion of venemous humours, and maladies
of the body: yet are they good and wholesome: so, though giving and
taking oathes came at the first from evill, namely the want of charity,
or fidelity in men, yet it doth not follow that oathes are evill or sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
in themselves.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The assumption is not true of all oathes, but of vaine, rash, or false
oathes; or customary swearing, at every other word in an ordinary
communication, these come from evill, (<hi>i.</hi>) the Devill, or from an ill
habit, or a bad conscience.</p>
                     <p>The Anabaptists argue thus,<note place="margin">Obj. 3.</note> Those things that are future, are not in
our power, therefore in swearing to doe such or such things, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
such or such Covenants, is to expose our selves to the danger of
Perjury.</p>
                     <p>But we answer.</p>

all promises, as well as oathes; nay it would impeach our vow
in Baptisme, to forsake the Devill and all his works, and to fight under
Christs Banner, &amp;c. For those things are not in our power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in those and all other promissory oathes, there is a condition tacite,
or expressed, <hi>Si Deus voluerit,</hi> as farre as God shall enable us, or So
help me God, or God being my helper.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In all such oathes by which we binde our selves to performe any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
act, we sweare not simply to make good the event, which often is
not in our power, but we engage our wills and utmost endeavours,
neither are we guilty of perjury, if we would, and could not, but if we
could and would not keep truth, and be as good as our words.</p>
                     <p>If the heathen have been more carefull to refraine the violation of
the name of God by frequent and usuall swearing then we,<note place="margin">Obj. 4.</note> they shall

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60443:76"/>
them were put to his oath, they accounted him a confessed lyer, and
such an one who had lost his reputation among honest men. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in

their faith with men, will make no scruple of conscience to forsweare
themselves by their Gods: An honest mans word is as good as his oath,

                     <p>All these examples of the heathen may bee alleadged to good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,

oathes by no allowance, who turn Christs meritorious sufferings in all

shall give account at the day of judgment of every idle word, much
more of execrable oathes: but it will not follow, we may not sweare
lightly or rashly to the great dishonour of God, and scandall of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

him to witnesse in matters of greatest moment, whereby we agnize his

                     <p>The second difficulty concerning oathes, is, whether they may bee
imposed. I answer briefly, they may, both by supreame and inferiour
Magistrates, deriving their authority from him; this I prove, First, by
cleare testimony of Scripture: Secondly, by the examples of holy and
religious men, who have both administred, and taken such oathes:

inward, as to adhere to God; to love him, to beleive in him, and

such like acts of Religion cannot be enforced. Secondly outward, as
comming to Church, receiving the Sacrament, and making confession

and bade many guests, and when they had made their severall excuses, said
to his servant, Goe to the high waies and hedges, and compell them to come

the taking of an oath, which though in all leagues, and covenants, and
holy vowes, it ought to be free; yet in diverse cases for the manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of truth in legall proceedings, and setting a period to otherwise

                     <p>As it is the prerogative of God to search the heart,<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> so also to bind the
conscience immediately, and directly: the lawes, ordinances, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of men, may work upon the outward man, but they cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the conscience directly and immediately, or by themselves; but so
farre only as they may be included in the generall command of God,
which is to obey those that are set over us in such things, as are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
to his will. Whence it is, that the Apostle pressing the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of obedience to higher powers, saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 5. that <hi>wee must

                     <p>None ought to be put to their oath who are like to forsweare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,

that it is very likely, for hope of reward, or to save their lives, limbes,
liberty, or estate; they will streigne a veine in their heart, and take a

                     <p>If a man be defamed for a prophane person,<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> or common swearer,
and much more if he have been convicted of perjury, he ought not to
be put to his oath; lest where before <hi>he dasht,</hi> he may the second time
<hi>make shipwrack of his faith, and a good conscience.</hi> But the rule of the
law is, <hi>Supponitur esse bonus, qui non probatur esse malus; He is suppa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

Though the Magistrate in some cases for the publick good exact an <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
oath of many men who forswear themselves, yet is not the Magistrate
any way author of, or accessary to their perjury. For he requireth them
to swear truly, not falsely; and for ought that he knoweth, they may as
well cleare themselves, as condemne themselves upon their oath; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth there appeare unto him any cause, or just suspition, that the
party to be sworne, is like to take a false oath; for if there doe, both in
conscience and in discretion, he will be shie of administring an oath to
such a person, in such a case.</p>
                     <p>The third difficulty concerning oathes is, whether the oath <hi>ex offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio,</hi>
be lawfull; that is, whether a Magistrate Ecclesiasticall or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
may require and exact an oath of a man, which in duty hee is
bound to take, in a case which concernes himselfe; and may tend to his
owne prejudice, and dammage. As in <hi>Ninus</hi> his victories, every for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
conquest, was <hi>gradus futurae victoriae, a degree and step to a latter;</hi>
so it falleth out in the determination of the difficulty concerning oaths:
the resolution of the former question, is a step and furtherance to the
latter. For if oathes be lawfull, the Magistrate may enjoyne them by
his authority; and if he may impose any oath, especially the oath <hi>ex
officio:</hi> without which, the ordinary proceedings, as well in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
Courts as temporall, will be stopt; and all speedy course of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
hindred: and although what hath been formerly alleadged in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
of the imposition of oathes, might suffice to resolve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of men, not forestalled with prejudicated opinions: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
this kind of oath hath been of late cryed down with much vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency,

                     <head>ARGUMENT I.</head>
                     <p>Every oath which may be taken in truth, judgement, and
righteousnesse, is lawfull; such is the oath <hi>ex officio.

                     <p>The Proposition is the Prophet <hi>Ieremies,</hi> the assumption is thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
according to each part of it. First it may be taken <hi>in truth,</hi> neither
is it required otherwise to be taken; the Tenour of it being, <q>There
are Articles in Court against you, or questions to be demanded of you;
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60443:79"/>
you shall answer the truth, and the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth; so farre as you know, and by law you are bound, so help you
God.</q> Secondly, it may be taken in <hi>judgement,</hi> for before wee are
required to give answer to any particular, the Articles are distinctly
read unto us, and we may deliberately and judicially shape our answer
thereunto at the present, if we perfectly remember every circumstance,
and find no scruple in the interrogatory: or we may crave farther time
to bethink our selves, to give a fuller answer. Thirdly, it may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in <hi>righteousnesse:</hi> for if we be innocent by our oaths, we shall acquit
our selvs, and if guilty, we shall give way to justice to proceed: and as it
is a righteous thing to acquit an innocent,<note place="margin">Jos. 7. 19.</note> so also to detect a Malefactor,
in which regard <hi>Iosuah</hi> perswadeth <hi>Achan</hi> to <hi>glorifie God by confession
of his sinne.</hi>

<hi>Matth. 26. 63. 64. the high Priest said unto him, I adjure

                  <p>If it had been either unlawfull for the high Priest to require Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

                  <p>This argument is not brought to prove the necessity of taking an
oath now in those very cases, as namely of jealousie, loan, and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
of strange wives, but the lawfulnesse of demanding, and taking
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60443:80"/>
an oath in causes criminall in generall.</p>
                  <p>All these instances come home to the point in question, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
holdeth strong <hi>à comparatus</hi> after this manner. No sufficient
reason can be alleadged, why oathes may not bee imposed and taken
as well by Christians under the Gospell, as by Jewes under the Law in
causes criminall, reflecting upon themselves: but oathes were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
demanded and taken by the Jewes in causes criminall, therefore
they may be so by Christians. That such oathes were by Gods law
injoyned to the Jewes, appeareth first in case of Ioane or trust, <hi>Exod.</hi>
22. 10, 11. If a <hi>man deliver to his neighbour an Asse, an Oxe, or a
Sheep, or any beast to keep; and it die, or be hurt, or driven away, no man

hath not put his hands to his neighbours goods; and the owner of it shall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
thereof, and he shall not make it good: but if it bee stolne from him,
he shall make restitution unto the owner thereof.</hi> In the case of jealousie,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 19. And <hi>the Priests shall set the woman before the Lord, and
uncover the womans head, and put the offering of memoriall in her hands;
which is the jealousie offering: and the Priest shall have in his hand the
bitter water, that causeth the curse; and the Priest shall charge her by an
oath, and say to the woman, if no man hath lyen with thee, and if thou
hast not gone aside to uncleannesse with another, instead of thy husband,
be thou free from this bitter water, which causeth the curse, &amp;c.</hi> In the
case of trespasse, 1. <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 31. If <hi>any man trespasse against his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,

In case of prohibited marriages, <hi>Ezra 10. 5. 11. Then arose</hi> Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,
<hi>and made the chiefe</hi> Priests, <hi>the</hi> Levites, <hi>and all</hi> Israel <hi>to sweare; that
they would put away their strange wives of the people of the land: and they
sware. And</hi> Ezra <hi>stood up, and said unto them, ye have transgressed, and
have taken strange wives, to increase the trespasse of</hi> Israel. <hi>Now
therefore make confession unto the Lord God of your fathers, and doe his
pleasure; and separate your selves from the people of the land, and from
the strange wives.</hi> It is true, these cases are not everyway paralel to ours,
for our Priests have no <hi>receipt</hi> at this day, to make the <hi>water of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;</hi>
nor are we prohibited to marry with forreyners, so wee <hi>marry in

For though the cases in particular bee very different, yet they
agree in this generall; that oathes have been lawfully urged and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
of men, touching matters dammageable, criminall and penall to
themselves: and if oathes may be lawfully imposed and taken in this
kind, to satisfie the humour of a jealous husband, or still the clamour
of a private person wronged, how much more is it equall and just, that
this be done upon the judges office, who is no way privately interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

are faulty, either by denying they forsweare themselves,
or by confessing the matter of fact, they consequently
condemne themselves: nay which is very considerable,
they who are the greatest oppugners of our Ecclesiasticall
Courts, and greatest sticklers for the discipline of <hi>Geneva,</hi>
are forced to make use of the oath <hi>ex officio</hi> themselves.

Heb. 6. 16. But this oath <hi>ex officio,</hi> is not ministred to make an end of
any Litigious suite, but rather to begin it, and set it on foot; for as soone
as Articles are put in against a man, before any pleading of the cause

                  <p>There are two sorts of oathes,<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> promissory of things to come, asserto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of things past. In promissory, there is no respect at all had to
compose any difference, or controversie, but to assure loyalty or fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
in assertory oathes, one end is ending strifes, but not the only end;
neither doth the Apostle imply, that every controversy may be decided
and ended by a single mans taking his oath. For this oath may be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and the contrary thereunto deposed by others; and sometimes
evidence of fact controls his oath: but the meaning is, that in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Though this oath be given in the beginning of a suit, to lay a firme

to the <hi>Quaestio Iuris;</hi> and the pleading it, and more maturely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding
it: and so this oath tendeth to the sooner ending of strife.</p>
                  <p>Either the crimes objected against any man are manifest,<note place="margin">Obj. 4.</note> or hidden:
if they bee open and manifest, there needs no oath <hi>ex officio</hi> to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
them, but witnesses only are to be produced, which in such cases
cannot be wanting: and if they be hidden and secret, then the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles

shall every man have praise of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apostle speaketh not in that place against any judiciall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note>
but against private, rash, and uncharitable judging of our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and taking his words in the worst part, without any just ground;

            <head type="sub">Concerning the office of the Civill Magistrate.</head>
            <p>THere remain many other errours of the Anabaptists, some blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous,
as the denying the incarnation of Christ from the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the blessed Virgin; some impure and lascivious,<note place="margin">See a Booke lately printed called Mons mortality.</note> as maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the plurality of wives: some drowzie and sottish, as the casting of
the soule into an Endymion sleep, untill the day of judgement. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these absurd positions are not at this day generally owned by
our Anabaptists, the last errour which I intend to encounter at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
is, that pernicious assertion of theirs, concerning the exauctora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all Civill Magistrates, whereby they dull the edge, or wring out
of their hands the sword of justice. Other of their errours fight against
the Church, but this against the State: others agaisnt piety, but this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Politie:<note place="margin">Cic. l. 2. de nat. deorum.</note> yet as <hi>Velleius</hi> in <hi>Tully</hi> goeth about, by reason, to prove
that nothing is more hurtfull to man then the gift of reason; so this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
against policie is most politickly devised by them: for there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but two censures which any need to fear, the Ecclesiasticall and the
Civill: and they regarding not the Ecclesiasticall, because they are out
of the pale of the Church; if they could keep themselves out of the
reach and stroake of the Civill sword, all were cock-sure with them;
they might every where securely both vent their errours, and practise
their villanies. This is the true reason why they so vehemently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that the coercive power of the Magistrate can no way consist
with the perfection of Christianity. Now although the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
be ordained of God for the suppression of all vice and heresie:
yet above all other, he ought to have an eye to this; for this hath a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
antipathy to Magistracie. The Magistrate shall beare his sword
in vaine indeed, if he let other heresies grow: but if this thrive in any
Kingdome, State, or Common-wealth, he shall not beare his sword
at all. There is that contrariety and repugnancie between this heresie
and that calling, that if Magistracie doe not speedily root out this he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
this heresie will extirpate all Magistracie; for thus much it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth
in formall tearmes.</p>

                  <p>There is no Paradox so absurd, saith the Oratour, which meets not
with some Patron among the learned, and I may adde farther, which
hath not some varnish of reason, yea and glosse also of Scripture put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

so the Civill Magistrates beare up the pillars of the earth, and
support the frame of all government: yet the Anabaptists bid them
Battaile, and furnish themselves with weapons against their calling
out of Scripture. First they wrest to their wicked purpose the words
of our Saviour, <hi>Iohn 18. 36. My Kingdome is not of this world. Ergo,</hi>
say they, no Christian ought to raigne as a King, or rule as a Governour
in this world.<note place="margin">Obj. 1.</note>

                  <p>But we answer, that the inference is unsound,<note place="margin">Sol. 1.</note> themselves being
Judges; for as he here professeth, that hee had no Kingdome here, so
elsewere that he had no house, or possessions; <hi>The Foxes,</hi> saith he, <hi>have
dens, and the Birds have nests, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60443:88"/>
lay his head:</hi> Yet the Anabaptists will not allow it for a good infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;
<hi>Ergo,</hi> no good Christian may hold house or lands. If then they
will have Kings to quit their Earthly Crownes, and Scepters, because
our Saviour had none such here, let them give a good example, and
first quit all their houses, goods, and lands; and follow Christ naked.</p>
                  <p>The meaning of our Saviours words is, that though indeed hee bee a
King, yet his Kingdome is not a Temporall Kingdome, in which hee
swayeth a Temporall sword, but a Spirituall Kingdome, whereby hee
ruleth the hearts of the faithfull: or that he is a King; and hath both his
<hi>Throne</hi> and his <hi>Guard,</hi> his <hi>Throne</hi> of glory, and his <hi>Guard</hi> of Angels:
but this his Kingdome is an heavenly, not an earthly Kingdome.
Notwithstanding, it will not hence follow, that earthly Kings and
Princes hold not their Crownes from him. For <hi>Solomon</hi> and Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> affirme the contrary, <hi>Solomon</hi> speaking in the person of Christ
saith,<note place="margin">Prov. 8. 15, 16. Apoc. 19. 16.</note>

Kingdom and a Spirituall are <hi>diversa,</hi> not <hi>adversa;</hi> diverse and distinct,
not adverse and contrary one to the other: Christ in a different capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
hath right to both; as God, hee administreth all Temporall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
by Kings and Princes appointed by him; and his Spirituall
Kingdome by Bishops, Pastors, and Ministers of the Gospell: Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
certain it is, that he warranteth and approveth of the authority of
Secular Kings, and Magistrates; for he commandeth <hi>all men to pay unto

from Temporall Rule and Dominion, You my Apostles shall

                        </hi>
                     </note> Dominatum. <hi>So</hi> Calvin:
<hi>Christs purpose here, was to distinguish between the office of an Apostle,
and a Prince;</hi> for this his speech was occasioned by a strife that fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the Apostles, which of them was the greatest in Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
to take away this strife, he admonisheth them, that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is spirituall; and that it consisteth not in worldly Pomp, Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or Dominion.</p>
                  <p>2. That in these words Christ forbids not simply all rule and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
but the ambitious affecting and tyrannicall exercising it, and they
prove this to be the meaning. 1. From the adjunct <hi>Gentiles,</hi> he saith not
simply, Kings exercise Lordship over them, but <hi>Kings of the Gentiles; but
you shall not doe so,</hi> that is, you shall not rule one over another, after the
manner of heathens. 2. From the preposition, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

so likewise <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (the word used in the originall) signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to abuse the Magistrates power, and to rule tyrannically. 3. By the
consequence, <hi>but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger;
and he that is chiefe, as he that doth serve:</hi> which words evidently imply
an imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rity among Christians, but such as may stand with Christian
humilitie, and mutuall service one to another. 4. By the comparison,
verse 28. <hi>As you have me for an example,</hi> whom though you <hi>justly call
Lord and master, for so I am, yet I am among you as he that serveth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Obj. 3.</note> As before they wrested our Saviours speech; so now in a
third place, they doe his practice; the same mind, say they, ought to be
in all Christians as was in Christ himselfe: but he refused a Kingdome,
when it was offered him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 15. Therefore no Christians ought
to accept of the office of a King, or civill Magistrate.</p>
                  <p>The sinewes of this argument, as the former, are weak,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> for there
were speciall reasons for which Christ refused to be made a King,
which concerne not Christians: for first hee was the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
whose Kingdome was not to be temporall, but spirituall, as you heard
in the solution to the first objection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The country of <hi>Iudea</hi> was at this time reduced into the
condition of a province under the Romane Empire, neither had the
people any power to chuse them a King: if then Christ had yeelded to
their motion, he should have been the Authour of a tumult and sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the State, and brought a great scandall and oblequie upon the
Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Christ when he came into the world, tooke upon him the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60443:89"/>
forme of a servant, and the chiefe end of his comming was to <hi>beare
our infirmities, and carry our sorrowes, to receive the chastisement of
our peace, and to lay downe his life for our ransome:</hi> which ignominious
death and sufferings would not well consort with the Majestie of a
pussiant temporall King. And how will it follow that because by
Christs example, no Christian ought to suffer himselfe to be made a
King by a popular tumult, that therefore no Christian may accept of a
Crowne in an elective Kingdome, if it be lawfully offered unto him,
or in a successive, if it be his right by descent?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Obj. 4.</note> They work upon Christs refusall to interpose in a quarrell
betweene two brothers about their patrimony, that which Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
(say they) no Christian ought to undertake: But Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
the office of a Judge, or arbitratour in a litigious suit like to
grow among brethren, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 13, 14. Therefore no Christian may
take the like office upon him.</p>
                  <p>But shallow as they are,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> they reach not the depth of our Saviours
reason, why he refused to be umpire or arbitratour in that controversie,
belonging to the Law, concerning right of inheritance; which was not
because he simply disliked such an imployment, as inconsistent with
Christian perfection, for among the eight beatitudes he alloweth one
<hi>to peace makers,</hi> Mat. 5. 9. and Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who wrote by his spirit,
warranteth and commendeth this worke of Christian charitie, to
compose differences among brethren, and prevent law suits, 1. Cor. 6. 2.
<hi>Dare any of you having a matter against another, goe to law before the
unjust, and not before the Saints? doe ye not know the Saints shall judge the
world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge
the smallest matters?</hi> But because he had no calling thereunto, <hi>who,</hi>
saith he, <hi>made me a judge or a divider over you?</hi> Though it had beene a
good worke in it selfe to set a period to a vexatious suit amongst bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
yet Christ was not sent to that end: and if he had embraced
businesse of this nature, as when he began to cure men miraculously, all
the sicke were brought to him, both farre and neere: so if like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Solomon,</hi> he had sate upon the Bench of Justice, to sentence causes
and determine mens right; he should never have wanted worke, all
men would have chosen such an Arbitratour, and all perplexed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled
suits would have been referred to his comprimize, and hereby
he would have been much hindred in his holy progresses to preach the
Gospel in all places, and much of his precious time would have been
taken up in judicature, and sacrilegiously robbed from the Church and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60443:89"/>
more holy employments for the good of souls. The instructions we are
to gather from Christs refusall to intermeddle with busines of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are, first, to walke within the duties of our calling, not to sit upon
the Bench without a Commission: the eye must not doe the office of
the hand, nor the hand of the foot: but every member his own work.
It is one thing to be a preacher of the Gospel, and another to be a Judge:
and though it be a good and charitable worke to cleare mens titles to
their Lands upon earth; yet it is better to <hi>cleare their title to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven.</hi> We must not therefore intermit, or neglect the duties
of our sacred Function for any civill whatsoever: nor upon any fair and
plausible pretence, ingage our selves in such businesses which may any
way stop, or hinder us in the course of our Ministery.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">Obj. 2.</note> They cast some of that <hi>dust in our eyes,</hi> on which our Saviour
<hi>wrote with his finger, Ioh.</hi> 8. 6. When the woman taken in adultery
was brought before him, the punishment (say they) of adultery is
as necessary as of any other crime: yet Christ would not inflict it,
nor pronounce sentence against the woman shamefully taken in
that grosse act of uncleannesse: therefore Christians ought not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
Civill punishments, or make use of the materiall sword, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themselves with the spirituall of excommunication, to cut off ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors
from the Church therewith.</p>
                  <p>But they weigh not the circumstances of the Text;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> the <hi>Scribes</hi>
and <hi>Pharisees</hi> intended not the execution of justice upon the woman,
but came a birding to catch our Saviour in a snare, which they laid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner: Will he judge this woman fit to be stoned according
to the Law, or not? it he will not judge her, we have a just quarrell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him for derogating from the Law of <hi>Moses:</hi> if he judge her fit
to suffer death, and condemne her to be stoned, wee shall have just
cause to question him, by what authority hee assumes to himselfe the
office of a Judge; Christ discerning the snare, thus breakes it in sunder,
<hi>He that is without sinne among you</hi> (saith he) <hi>let him first cast a stone at
her.</hi> Which is as if he should have said, The matter of fact is evident,
the woman is guilty, and the law is as cleare, <hi>shee ought to be stone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>:</hi>
but who are you who demand the rigour of the Law to be executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her? are you free from this foule aspersion? are you innocent from
this great offence? look into the book of your owne conscience, or if
not, read what you see here written in the dust. Thus touching on
their sore, they shrinke, and withdraw themselves away one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the woman is left alone with our Saviour, whom he dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60443:90"/>
with a gracious admonition, <hi>Goe and sinne no more, vers.</hi> 11. What
will the Anabaptist conclude from hence? that because Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
not this woman to death according to Law, that therefore
no Christian may inflict corporall punishment for adultery? by the
same reason they might inferre against themselves and their owne pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises,
that because Christ severed not this woman from the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that therefore no Minister of God, or spirituall Magistrate, may
excommunicate for adultery, or the like crimes.</p>
                  <p>That which we are from this example of our Saviour to learne for
our instruction, is, first, That Christ <hi>came not to destroy, but to save;</hi>
not to punish, but to forgive sinne, not to bereave any of their Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
life, but to purchase for all true believers, and penitent sinners, a
Spirituall and Eternall life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that all they who are overtaken with any sinne or crime
punishable by the Law, ought not to prosecute the extremity against
others, who stick in the same mud with themselves. The snuffers
which were to mend the lights in the Sanctuary, by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
were to be made of pure gold; to teach us, that they who take
upon them to accuse and censure others, ought themselves to be most
free from blame; especially in the same kind of transgression: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
they are like to heare <hi>Physitian cure thy selfe,</hi> or out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.
21. <hi>Thou which teachest another, teachest thou not thy selfe? thou which
preachest a man should not steale, dost thou steale? thou which saist a man
should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery?</hi> or as we have it,
<hi>Ioh. 8. 7. He that is without sinne, ltt him cast the first stone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that the Ministers of the Gospell by the example of our
blessed Saviour, when sinners are brought before them, confounded
with shame in themselves, and so strangled with their inward guilt,
that they are not able to speak a word in their own defence, or for their
excuse, ought to have compassion on them, and upon their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and humiliation send them away with some comfort aad godly
admonitions, as our Saviour doth here: <hi>Hath none condemned thee?
neither doe I: goe, and sinne no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Obj. 8.</note> they argue very weakly, <hi>ab authoritate negativè,</hi> after this
manner: We read in holy Scripture of no Christians that ever sate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the throne of Majesty, or Bench of Justice, neither in the age of the
Apostles, nor in the prime and best times doe we heare of any Civill
Magistrate exercising any authority in the Church: therefore Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ought to exercise no such authority, nor execute any such office.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:60443:90"/>
But this argument, like snow, when the weather growes warme,<note place="margin">Sol.</note>
dissolves of it selfe: For, 1. As we read in the New Testament of no
Christian Kings, Judges, Sheriffes, or other Officers attending on
Courts of justice: so neither doe wee read of any that taught the
Tongues, Arts, or Sciences, or trades in foraine parts, or exercised
any kind of Manufactures now in use: yet no man doubteth but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred did so, and questionlesse Ministers of justice, are as necessary
in every City and Towne Corporate, as Merchants or Artizens. This
argument therefore <hi>ab anthoritate negativè,</hi> may justly bee answered
negatively: If there were no Christian Magistrates, they could not bee
recorded in Scriptures; but it will not follow, none are mentioned or
recorded in Scripture, <hi>Ergo,</hi> there were none.</p>
                  <p>2. Though the story of <hi>Abgarus</hi> King of <hi>Edessa</hi> his conversion to
the Christian faith may be Apocryphall, yet the story of the Eunuch
related <hi>Acts 8. 27. A man of great authority under</hi> Candace <hi>Queene
of</hi> Ethopia is Canonicall, and <hi>Nicodemus a Ruler among the Iewes,</hi> and
<hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea the Senatour,</hi> and <hi>Theophilus,</hi> to whom Saint <hi>Luke</hi>
intitles his Gospell, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> the <hi>Centurion,</hi> and <hi>Publius the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of Melita,</hi> and <hi>Sergius Paulus the Proconsull,</hi> and <hi>Erastus the
Chamberlaine,</hi> and <hi>some of Neroes family,</hi> whose names are registred
in the book of life, make good the observation of the Apostle, <hi>that
though not many Noble men, not many mighty men, not many in great
place or authority;</hi> yet some such were called even in the Apostles
time, which are sufficient to rebate the edge of this argument.</p>
                  <p>3. Admit that there were few or no Converts in the Apostles
dayes, who held the place, or executed the office of Magistrates: yet
(that which is sufficient to prove the lawfulnesse and necessity of that
calling) Christ himselfe both acknowledged and submitted unto the
authority of <hi>Pilat,</hi> and paid tribute to <hi>Caesar;</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> appeales
to <hi>Augustus,</hi> and complaines to <hi>Lysias</hi> of a conspiracy against him,
and was rescued by him.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, though the Christian Church at the beginning was <hi>cast out</hi>
as it were <hi>starke naked, and lay in the open field weltring in her owne
blood, and no eye pitied her;</hi> yet in processe of time the predictions of
the Prophets were accomplished, <hi>She had Kings to be her nursing Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and Queenes to be her nursing Mothers,</hi> and all sorts of Civill
Magistrates, both supreame and subordinate, to be her Gardians, and
Protectours. And as the earth in <hi>Italy</hi> never bare so great a burthen
on it, nor yeilded so plentifull a crop, as when it was turned up <hi>laure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ato

                  <p>The <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> conceived the Celestiall Spheres to bee like

                     <p>The Kings Majesty hath the chief power in this Realm of <hi>England,</hi>
and other his Dominions; unto whom the chiefe government of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
of this Realm, whether they be Ecclesiasticall or Civill, in all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
doth appertain, and is not, nor ought to be subject to any forrain ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.
The Lawes of the Realm may punish Christian men with
death, for heinous and grievous offences.</p>
                     <p>The summe of all is, the Civill Magistrate is a divine ordinance, and
his chiefe care is, or ought to be Religion; for the defence and vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof God hath put a sword in his hand, to cut off the distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Peace, as well in the Church as the Common-wealth: and
because he is the Minister of God for our wealth and safety, his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is to be obeyed by all sorts of men for conscience sake, and not to be
resisted upon paine of damnation,</p>
                     <p>And now Christian Reader, thou hast heard a Harmony, listen not to
discords; thou hast heard a consort of silver Trumpets, hearken not to a
single oat-pipe, or the harsh sound of Rams hornes; thou hast heard
the suffrages of all the learned Divines in the Reformed Churches;
regard not the votes of a few illiterate Mechanicks, much lesse the
fancie and dreames of fanaticall Enthusiasts; who because they are <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomolaes</hi>
themselves, would not by their good will there should bee
any Rules: because they are wandring Starres, they would have none
fixt; because they are dissolute, they would have no bonds of Lawes;
because they are Schismaticks, and Non-conformists, they would have
no Discipline in the Church; because they are dunces, and ignorant
both of Tongues and Arts, they would have no learning, nor Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities:
Lastly, because they walke inordinately, they would have no
coercive power in the Magistrate to restraine them. There was never
more cause then now to take heed what thou hearest, <hi>and to try the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
whether they are of God or no; for there is not one only <hi>lying spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
as in the dayes of <hi>Ahab,</hi> but many lying spirits in the mouthes of
Prophets; not only <hi>Romish Priests</hi> and <hi>Iesuits,</hi> who endeavour to seduce
thee to spirituall thraldome, idolatry and superstition, but also diverse
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60443:94"/>
sorts of schismaticall Teachers, who intice thee to carnall liberty, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanenesse,
sacriledge, and faction. When I first heard of the manner
of taking Apes in the <hi>Indies,</hi> I could scarce forbeare laughter; but now
seeing dayly men of worth and parts, caught after the same manner by
our new Sectaries, I can hardly refrain tears. The maner of taking those
beasts is thus described: he that goes about to catch Apes in those parts
of <hi>America,</hi> which abound with them, brings a Bason with fair water,
and therein paddles with his hands, and washeth his face in sight of
the Apes; and then steps aside for a while: the Ape seeing the coast
cleare, steales to the Bason, and seeing his face in the water, is much
delighted therewith; and in imitation of the man, dabbles with his
feet in the cleare water, and washes his face, and wipes his eyes; and
after this, he lyes in wait for him, fetches away the Bason, powres out
the faire water, and fills it againe with water mingled with bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime;
and puts the Bason in the place where it stood before: the Ape
returning to the Bason and suspecting nothing, puts his feet in the bird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime,
and with that foul &amp; mingled water washes his face, and wipes
his eyes; which are thereby so dazled, &amp; the eye-lids closed up, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares
he is easily caught. In like manner, these late Proselytes,
who invade many empty Pulpits in the City and Suburbs, at the first in
their Sermons set before thee as it were a Bason of the pure water of
life, wherin thou maist see thy face, &amp; wash away the spots of thy soul;
but after they have got thy liking and good opinion, &amp; confide in thee,
then they mingle bird-lime with the water of life: the birdlime of
Socinianisme, of Libertinisme, or Antinominianisme, Brownisme, and
Anabaptisme: wherewith, after they have put out or closed the
eyes of thy judgement, they lead thee whither they lift, and make a
prey of thee. <hi>Praemonitus praemunitus,</hi> I have forewarned thee, bee
thou forearmed against them, and the Lord give thee a right judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in all things, <hi>Gastius de exord. Anabap. p. 495. Quia Anabaptistae
à veritate avertunt aures, idea Deus mittit illis Doctores, non qui lingua
medica sanarent ulcera ipsorum, sed qui pruritum ac scabiem affectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
ipsorum commodè scalperent.</hi> Because the Anabaptists turn away
their eares from the truth, God sendeth them teachers according to
their desire; not such as with their wholesome tongues and doctrine
heale their sores, but with their nailes scratch gently the itch of their
carnall lusts and affections.</p>

because they say they cannot be assured of the truth of their faith, and
repentance; by which reason they should forbid or forbear the christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of men in riper yeares also, forasmuch as these teachers can be no
way assured of the sincerity of their Scholars faith, and true purpose of
amendment of life. For though they professe the one, and promise the
other; yet they may do it in hypocrisie, and for worldly ends. Or if
they will say we ought to beleive their profession and promise for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
why then ought we not as well to beleive their profession and
promise for their Children, when the Fathers or God-fathers under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
for them at the Font?</p>
               <p>Secondly, they preach the doctrine of mortification of the flesh, and
crucifying the lusts thereof; and yet withall they maintaine plurality
of wives, and adulterous and incestuous copulations, under the title of
spirituall marriages, with those of their own Sect.</p>
               <q>Conjugium<note n="h" place="margin">Virg. Aen. 4.</note> vocat, hoc praetexit nomine culpam.</q>
               <p>Thirdly, they allow of no set formes of prayer, or studied Sermons; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
such as they conceive, who use them, <hi>pray not by the Spirit:</hi> yet
themselves in their Assemblies make use of set hymnes, and Psalmes,
which notwithstanding they make us beleive they <hi>sing by the Spirit,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the example of the Apostle:<note place="margin">Cor. 14. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>I will pray with the spirit, and will
pray with understanding also, I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing
with understanding also.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, they cry up the doctrine of the crosse, and boast much of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60443:96"/>
their suffering for righteousnesse sake: yet where they get any strength
and can make head, they <hi>resist the powers ordained of God,</hi> and make
war against their lawfull superiours, as we may soe in <hi>Sleiden, Gastius,</hi>
and <hi>Guy-de-bres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, They inveigh against covetousnesse, and to extirpate that <hi>root
of all evill,</hi> teach men to renounce all proprietie in their goods, and
to <hi>have all things in common:</hi> Yet they rob Monasteries, plunder
townes, and villages, rifle houses, and turne the wicked, as they tearm
them, out of their possessions, and hold them themselves; and when
they are upbraided with this their rapine, they alleadge that text for
themselves, <hi>The meek shall possesse the earth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 5.</note> presuming themselves to be
those meeke ones, though we shall prove them hereafter to be a most
cruell and bloody sect.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, They teach that the office of a civill Magistrate cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
with Christian perfection, yet they themselves in Munster and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
had a <hi>Consul,</hi> and <hi>Senatours,</hi> and a <hi>Headsman</hi> of their own, yea,
and a King also, <hi>Iohn Leiden</hi> the Tayler, who <hi>stitched up a Kingdome</hi>
in one yeer, and <hi>ravelled it out</hi> the next.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, They strip themselves stark naked, not onely when they
flocke in great multitudes, men and women together, to their <hi>Iordans</hi>
to be dipt; but also upon other occasions, when the season permits:
and when they are questioned for it, they shelter this their shamelesse
act, with the proverb, <hi>Veritas nuda est,</hi> the <hi>truth is naked,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
no <hi>vail, masque,</hi> or guise; which reason if it were good, would
hinder them from holding private Conventicles as they do, and when
there is processe out against them, running into corners to hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
for as the proverb is, <hi>Veritas nuda est,</hi> Truth is naked, which
warranteth them, as they conceive, to throw off their clothes: so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
there is a like proverb, <hi>Veritas non quaerit angulos, truth seekes no
corners,</hi> nor innocencie starting holes, yet they doe.</p>
               <p>Lastly, in their Confession printed this yeer, they finde themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved
with the name of Anabaptist, saying, <hi>they are falstly so called:</hi> yet
it is well knowne they all of them either rebaptize or are rebaptized,
and consequently are properly <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> actively or passively. But
as <hi>Corvinus</hi> in his elder age so quite lost his memory, that he forgot
his owne name: so these are so ignorant, that they know not their own
proper name. If these disclaime second Baptisme, they are none of the
sect: if they practise it, how can they truely say that they are falsly
called Anabaptist? If Anabaptists be <hi>their nicke name,</hi> what is their
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60443:97"/>
right name, whereby they may be distinguished from mother Christians
Catholike or Hereticks? They have hitherto been known in generall
by no other names then of Anabaptists, or Catabaptists, and <hi>never
a barrell better herring.</hi> And Anabaptist <hi>deprives</hi> children of Baptisme,
and a Catabaptist <hi>depraves</hi> Baptisme. A Catabaptist may sometimes
be no Anabaptist, such as was <hi>Leo Copronymus,</hi> who defiled the Font
at his Baptisme, yet was he not Christened againe: but every Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist
is necessarily a <hi>Catabaptist;</hi> for the iteration of that Sacrament
is an abuse and pollution thereof.</p>

                  <hi>Thomas Muncer</hi> was most famous in
the Anabaptists chronicle, who when the people that were discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with their Magistrates, and encouraged by their hereticall teachers
to rebell in <hi>Franconia,</hi> drew themselves into the body of an Armie,
this <hi>Muncer</hi> marched not in the place (assigned for false prophets)
in <hi>the taile,</hi> but in the <hi>head,</hi> and there made an oration to the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<q>Advance brave spirits, ride on with your honour, and your right
hand shall teach you terrible things. For God hath revealed to me,
that the day shall be yours, he promised me, he who cannot lie, nor
deceive, assured me, that he will fight for you; let not the Princes
Artillery terrifie you, for this robe of mine shall receive, and dead all
the bullets shot at you: look up to the sky, see you not there a rainbow
in the clouds, the colours whereof we beare in our Streamers and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,

               </p>
               <p>But the even answered not expectation: the <hi>bow</hi> in the clouds did
them no service at all in their warre, neither did their prophet <hi>Muncer
his robe</hi> serve as a target of steele to repell, and dead all the bullets shot
against them; but as soone as ever this army of the Bores, and that other
of the Princes were engaged, the people were miserably slaughtered
with <hi>Veni Creator spiritus,</hi> in their mouths; expecting that God should
fight for them from heaven, according to <hi>Muncers</hi> promise. Of <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi>
and <hi>Melchior Hofman,</hi> see before <hi>Sect.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Muncer</hi> and his chiefe associates; and <hi>Phifer,</hi> who deluded the
people as much with dreames, as <hi>Muncer</hi> with visions; had acted their
parts: <hi>Iohn Becold</hi> commonly known by the name of <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leiden,</hi>
and <hi>Iohn Tuscoverer</hi> came upon the stage, and they so well acquitted
themselves in the persons they took upon them, that the one gained the
reputation of a Prophet, the other the title, and (for a time) the power
of a King. First <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Leiden</hi> in a fanaticall fury (pretending a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall
spirit) puts off his cloathes, and runs naked through the City
of <hi>Munster,</hi> crying, The <hi>King of</hi> Sion <hi>is come, the King of</hi> Sion <hi>is come:</hi>
Then returning home falls into a deep sleep, dreames for three dayes
together, and as soon as he awaked faines himselfe speechlesse, and by
signes demands Paper and Inke, and sets down twelve men, most of
them mean tradesmen, to bee governours of the City of <hi>Munster:</hi>

neither cleanse their conscience from the guilt, nor their reputation
from the staine of carnall impurity. For though they tolerate not
Stewes as the Pope doth, yet they allow of plurality of wives, and
most uncleane practices under the name of spirituall marriages, nay
some of them have not blushed to affirme that none of their Sect can
commit adultery: because <hi>adulterium,</hi> according to the Etymologie

instild this doctrine into the weaker Sex, but two maids at <hi>Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi>
immediately after their second Baptisme, made ship-wrack of
their virginity; and a third dashing at the same rock, and being called
in question by the Magistrate for her incontinency, professed that shee
out of her pure conscience did it; that is, playd the Whore. <hi>For the
Ring-leaders of our Sect told me, said she, that it was the will of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Father, that I should deny none the debt of Spirituall matrimony;

though he pretended to never so much holinesse, yet was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by a souldier in the night to steale from his wives bed, and truckle

the marriage, he fell into that Propheticall sleep I spake of before,
and after he had dreamed three dayes and three nights together, proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
his dreame for a divine Oracle; that no man was tyed to one wife:
after which his Proclamation, all his Subjects ran to the handsomest
women in the City, striving who should bee served first; and some
with a forme of spirituall contract, some without it, so blasted the
fairest flowers in all <hi>Munster,</hi> that there was not a maid of fourteene

               <p>Of the like staine, though not altogether of the same straine, were
the two false Prophets discovered in <hi>London, 1642. Richard Farnham,</hi>

his fifteene wives (for so many he had) somewhat more conscientious
then the rest, said that she thought God was not well pleased with
their feasting, and rioting in the palace, when the people pined for
hunger in their houses, and many dyed famished in the streets; the King
being told of it, brought her to the market place with other of his
wives, &amp; making her kneel down, there cut off her head, &amp; commanded
his other wives to sing and give praises for it to the heavenly Father. It
will be here said that our Anabaptists in England were never arraigned,
or condemned for any such crimes, and that they seem to be a sillie and
harmelesse people: yet let us take heed how we suffer the egges of the
cockatrice to remain amongst us; for when they be hatched there will
break out of them most venemous serpents. The Lyon when he is

hath her proper seat in the middle between superstition in the excesse,
and profanenesse in the defect: and of the two extreames profanenesse
is the worse, because it is neare neighbour to atheisme, which plucks
up all Religion by the root, out of the heart. <hi>Religio</hi> is so called <hi>à



Religando,</hi> because it bindeth the soule to God with the girdle of
veritie: this golden belt of veritie, superstition ties too hard, and
strait, prophanenesse too wide and loose. A superstitious man feareth
God in such sort as he ought not, a prophane person feareth him not as
he ought: the superstitious attribute that worship to God, which he
requireth not, the prophane yeild him not that worship he requireth:
superstition <hi>attireth</hi> Religion over gorgeously, prophanenesse strips her

here with a heart of Adamant, and brow of brasse will be

hearted Christians:<note place="margin">Ingerunt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum verba ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis ut virus falsitatis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troeat.</note> upon whom through false suggestions, the hand

<hi>Epicures;</hi> and <hi>Psychopannychists;</hi> and to this purpose they have published
this confession of their Faith, subscribed by fifteen persons in the name
of seven Churches in London.</p>
            <p>Of which I may truely say as Saint <hi>Hilarie</hi> doth of that of the
<hi>Arrians, they offer to the unlearned their faire cup full of venome, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing
the brim with the honey of sweet and holy words, they thrust
in store of true positions, that together with them they may juggle in
the venome of their falshood:</hi> they cover a little ratsbane in a great
quantity of sugar that it may not be discerned. For among the fifty
three Articles of their confession, there are not above six but may passe
with a faire construction: and in those six none of the foulest and most
odious positions wherewith that Sect is aspersed are expressed. What
then? are all that have imployed their tongue and pen against them
heretofore no better then calumniators and false accusers of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?
nothing lesse; for besides the testimonies of <hi>Melancthon, Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger,
Sleiden, Gastius, Pontanus, Guidebres,</hi> &amp; others who lived among
them, by the harmonie of all the Protestant Churches confessions it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that the masters of our Anabaptists &amp; Ring-leaders of that sect in
<hi>Switzerland, Suevia, Franconia, Munster, Saxonie,</hi> and the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
held such erroneous tenets as are above mentioned; and if their
Scholars in England have learned no such doctrines from them, it is
because they are <hi>punies</hi> in their School, and have not taken any <hi>Lesson</hi> in
<hi>the upper forms;</hi> they have but sipt of the cup I spake before of, the
divell holds them but by the heel only as <hi>Thetis</hi> did <hi>Achilles</hi> when
she dipt him in the sea.</p>
            <p>We read in <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> of certain creatures about the shores of
<hi>Nilus</hi> not fully formed, and in a Stone-cutters shop we see here the
head of a man, there all the upper parts carved, in a third place the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
statue: so it seems to me that these Anabaptists are but <hi>in fieri</hi> (as
the Schooles speak) not <hi>in facto esse;</hi> like the fish and Serpents in the
mud of <hi>Nilus,</hi> not fully shaped: like a statue in the Stone-cutters
shop, not finished: they are Anabaptists but in part, not in whole. Be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60443:105"/>
it so, for I desire to make them rather better, then worse then they are.
I will therefore lay nothing to them but that they owne, nor bring any
other evidence against them, then this their confession. In which I
except,</p>
            <p>First, against those words in the thirty one Article, <hi>Whatsoever the
Saints any of them doe possesse or enjoy of God in this life, is by Faith.</hi>
This passage savours ranke of that errour or heresie (call it which you
please) imputed to <hi>Armacanus,</hi> who is said to have taught that the
right of all possessions and goods or temporall blessings is founded in
grace, not in nature; and that we hold them by no legall tenure, but
Evangelicall promises: and true it is that none but the faithfull <hi>hold in
capite,</hi> nor have any but true beleevers, <hi>a comfortable and sanctified use
of the creatures, and a spirituall title</hi> to them; but yet it cannot be denied
that they may have, and many have actually a legall title to them, and
civill interest in them even before they are in Christ, or adopted into his
family by actuall Faith: for if it were otherwise, <hi>Esau</hi> should have had
no right to mount <hi>Seir,</hi> nor <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to <hi>Tyre,</hi> which yet
the text saith God bestowed upon them: nay if this position may take
place, no childe shall have any right to his fathers inheritance, nor
Prince newly borne to his Crowne: which is not only an absurd, but
a very dangerous and seditious assertion. None of the foure great
<hi>Monarchs</hi> of the world represented in <hi>Daniels</hi> vision, for ought can be
proved, were true beleevers, though some of them did some outward
acts of pietie, and afforded some reall courtesies to the people of God:
yet of these Kingdomes the Prophet speaking, saith,<note place="margin">Dan. 4. 25. 32.</note> that <hi>the most High
ruleth in them, and giveth them to whomsoever he will,</hi> and Saint <hi>Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
is bold to say, that the same God who set the Crowne upon <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi>
the Christians head, gave the Empire of the world to <hi>Iulian</hi>
the <hi>Apostata:</hi> Nay Christ himselfe paid tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that he had a right to the tribute money,<note place="margin">Mat. 22. 21.</note> saying, <hi>Render unto Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar
the things that are Caesars:</hi> Yet that <hi>Caesar</hi> he spake of was <hi>Tiberius,</hi>
an enemy to all godlinesse, and a kind of monster among men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, I except against those words in the 38. Article</hi> that the
due maintenance of the officers aforesaid should be the free, and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
communication of the Church, and not by constraint to be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
from the people by aforced Law.</p>
            <p>These words may carry a double sense: if their meaning be that all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
Christians ought freely to contribute to the maintenance of the
ministery, &amp; should not need any law to inforce them: we embrace their
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60443:106"/>
good affection to the Church, and Churchmen; but if their meaning be,
that the maintenance ought to depend upon the voluntary contribution
of their parishioners, and that in case the flock should deny their Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds
either part of their milke or fleece, that the Pastours should have
no assistance of Law to recover them: this their opinion is most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
and sacrilegious, and directly repugnant to the Law of God,
which assigneth tithes for the maintenance of the Priests; and that
Law of God in the old Testament is not abrogated in the new, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

tithing mint and cummin, saith,<note place="margin">Luke. 11. 42.</note> 
               <hi>those things ye ought to do, and not
leave these things undone:</hi> and the Apostle proveth that the ministers of
the Gospel ought to live of the Gospel,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 9 10. For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law of Moses, thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the oxe that tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out the corne: doth God take care of oxen? or saith he, is it altogether for our sakes? no doubt this is written, that he that ploweth should plow in hope, and he that thresheth in hope shall be partaker of his hope.</note> both by the Law of God, and
by the Law of nature, vers. 7. <hi>Who goeth a warfare on his own charge?

a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</hi> and vers. 13. <hi>Doe
ye not know that those that minister about holy things live of the things of
the Temple, and they that wait at the Altar, be partakers with the
Altar? even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the
Gospel should live of the Gospel.</hi> He saith not God permitteth or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
of it, but ordaineth and commandeth it. And lest these two
strings should not be strong enough, to keepe the bow still bent, he

               <hi>let him that is taught
in the word communicate to him that teacheth in all good things.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
when we read that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> gave tithes, I demand by
what Law, whether by the Law of nature, or the Leviticall or Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall?
not by vertue of the Leviticall, for that Law was not then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
and by that Law <hi>Levi</hi> was to receive, not pay tithes. Yet <hi>Levi</hi>
himselfe in <hi>Abraham</hi> paid tithes to <hi>Melchisedech:</hi> if they paid it by
the Law of nature, that bindeth all men: if by the Evangelicall Law, it
bindeth all Christians to pay their tithes towards the maintenance of
<hi>Melchisedechs Priesthood which endureth for ever.</hi> And Saint <hi>Austine</hi>
fearfully upon this ground threatneth all those who refuse willingly
to pay their tithes, that God would reduce them to a tithe, and blast
all the nine parts of their estate.<note place="margin">Serm. <hi>de temp.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 18. 19.</note> I except against the thirty ninth Article, viz. that baptisme is
<q>an ordinance of the new Testament,<note place="margin">Mark 16. 16.</note> given by Christ to be dispensed
only upon persons professing Faith,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 37. 38. et. 8. 36. 37. 38. et. 18. 8.</note> or that are disciples, or taught,
who upon a profession of Faith ought to be baptized.</q> Here they lispe
not, but speak out plaine their Anabaptisticall doctrine: whereby they
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60443:106"/>
exclude all the children of the faithfull from the sacrament of entrance
into the Church, and the only outward meanes of their salvation in
that state: but the best of their proofes fall short, the word <hi>only</hi> which <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
can prove this their assertion is not found in any of the texts alledged
in the margent, nor can the sense of it be collected from thence. For
though it is most true and evident in the letter of those texts, that all
Nations that are to be converted, and all men in them of yeers of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that have been taught the principles of Religion, ought to make
profession of their Faith before they are baptized, as all that came to
mens estate among the Jews or proselytes, ought both to know, and to
give their assent to the covenant, before they received the seal thereof,
to wit, circumcision: yet no such thing was or could be required of
children, who notwithstanding were circumcised the eight day: so
by the judgement of all the Christian Churches in the world, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of beleevers, who are comprised in the letter of the covenant,
may receive the seal thereof, to wit, baptisme, though they cannot make
profession of their Faith by themselves, for the present, but others
make it for them, and in their stead: the affirmative is true, that all
that make profession of their Faith, and testifie their unfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
are to be baptized: but the negative is most false, that none are
to be baptized who have not before made such profession of their Faith,
when by reason of their infancie they are not capable to be taught. But
this hereticall assertion is at large resu'ed by manifold Arguments
drawne from Scripture, Fathers and reason, and all their cavils and
evasions exploded, Article 2. to which I refer the Reader.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I except against the fortieth Article, viz. The way and
<q>manner of dispensing of this Ordinance, the Scripture holds out to be
dipping or plunging the whole body under water; it being a signe,
must answer the things signified, which are these, 1. The washing
of the whole soul in the blood of Christ: 2. That interest the Saints
have in the death, buriall, and resurrection of Christ: 3. Together
with a confirmation of our Faith, that as certainly as the body is
buried under water, and riseth again, so certainly shall the bodies of
the Saints be raised by the power of Christ in the day of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to reigne with Christ.</q> This Article is wholly sowred with
the new leaven of Anabaptisme, I say the <hi>new leaven,</hi> for it cannot be
proved that any of the ancient Anabaptists maintained any such po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
there being three wayes of baptizing, either by dipping, or
washing, or sprinkling, to which the Scripture alludeth in sundry
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60443:107"/>
places: the Sacrament is rightly administred by any of the three, and
whatsoever is here alleadged for dipping, we approve of so far as it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
not the other two. Dipping may be, and hath been used in some
places, <hi>trina immersio,</hi> a threefold dipping; but there is no necessity of
it: it is not essentiall to Baptisme, neither doe the Texts in the margent
conclude any such thing. It is true, <hi>Iohn</hi> baptized Christ in <hi>Iordan,</hi> and
<hi>Philip</hi> baptized the Eunuch in the river: but the Text saith not that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Eunuch, or Christ himselfe, or any baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> or his
Disciples, or any of Christs Disciples, were <hi>dipped, plunged,</hi> or <hi>dowsed</hi>
over head and eares, as this Article implyeth, and our Anabaptists
now practise.</p>
            <p>Againe, the bare example of Christ and his Apostles without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
doth not bind the Church, and precept there is none for dipping;
it is certaine Christ and his Apostles celebrated the Communion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Supper, and in unleavened bread; and with such a gesture as was
then in use among the Jewes: yet because there is no precept in the
Gospell for these things, no Christian Church at this day precisely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth
those circumstances, and therefore <hi>dato &amp; non concesso,</hi> that
Christ and Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> or their Disciples, used dipping in Baptisme; it
will not follow that we ought to baptize in the like and no other
manner. Besides it ought to be noted, that in the beginning, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
had no Churches, nor Fonts in them; and there being many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds,
nay thousands, often to be baptized together: there was a kind
of necessity that this Sacrament should be administred in rivers, or such
places where were store of waters, <hi>as there were in Enon neare</hi> Salem,
<hi>where</hi> John <hi>baptized.</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 3. 22.</note> But now the Church hath better provided, there
being Christian Oratories every where, and Fonts in them most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
for this purpose; whereunto I shall need to adde here no more,
having fully handled this point both <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Fiftly, I except against the 41. Article, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>The persons designed
by Christ to dispence this ordinance, the Scripture hold forth to be
a preaching Disciple, it being no where tyed to a particular Church,

needs be? if all be Pastours, where are their flocks? if all be tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
where are their Scolars? a preaching Disciple sounds as harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a Scholar Master, or a Lecturing hearer; it is true, we grant that all
who have received gifts from God, ought to make use of them for the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60443:107"/>
benefit of others, and if any abound in knowledge, hee ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate

this necessary duty of imploying our talent, whatsoever
it be to our Masters best advantage, none may take upon him the cure
of soules without Commission; nor divide the word, and dispence

except hee bee called as was</hi> Aaron: none may open and shut the

neither a calling without gifts, nor gifts without a calling, makes

               <hi>Luther</hi> advised the Senate to demand of him what cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
he had to doe such things he did, and if he should avouch God for
the Author of his calling, then they should require of him to prove
that his calling from God by some eminent signe; for that whensoever
it pleaseth God to change the ordinary course, and to call any man to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
office extraordinarily; he declares that his good will and pleasure by
some evident signe. If the calling of the Anabaptisticall teachers bee
be ordinary, let them demonstrate it by Scripture; if extraordinary,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60443:108"/>
let them prove it by miracle. For the prophecy they spake of, let them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
declare what kind of Prophecying they mean, and whom they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
Prophets: for prophecying is taken in a double sense in holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
sometimes according to the propriety of the Greek derivation, for
the prediction of things future: sometimes in a larger sense, for revealing
the mysteries of God, &amp; expounding his Oracles either co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning things
past, present, or to come; and this two manner of wayes, either with
study and upon premeditation, with the help of Arts and Tongues,
and by consulting the best Commentaries both ancient and latter, or
without any study or premeditation, by immediate revelation or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration.
Prophecy in the first sense is an extraordinary calling; in the
last an extraordinary gift; in the middle acception an ordinary Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall
duty. And if that custome which Arch-Bishop <hi>Grindall</hi> would
have introduced into the Church in the dayes of <hi>Q. Elizabeth,</hi> and is in
use at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and among some other reformed Churches, were put in
practise in England, and a certaine number of learned and able Pastours
met at some set times, and having before notice of the Texts to be
handled, should every one in their order deliver their severall interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
observations, and applications thereof, (which they call Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecying)
we should exceedingly approve of it; and questionles, thereby

for rude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and illiterate Mechanicks, without calling, without knowledge
of Arts, or Tongues, upon a Scripture read in the Congregation to give
their suddain judgements, and interpretations thereof, as is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

If they could now doe as the Primitive <hi>Corinthians</hi> could, not onely
pray by the spirit, but sing by the spirit: if upon the first proposall of

of the Spirit, together with the glisning of the fiery tongues,

tongues, that they cannot speak correctly and coherently in one: if
they are so wide of the sense of the place they expound, that their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphrases
are often without sense: if they utter old broken notes taken
from none of the best Sermons, for new revelations: if they furbish up
ancient heresies that have layne long in the dark, for Christian Armour
of Light: if in their interpretations they not only contradict the
Scriptures but themselves: and in stead of a musicall consent we hear
nothing but vain janglings: if their prophecyings for the time past
have bin no better, and none can prophecie or promise better of them
for the time to come, though they pretend never so much to the spirit,
