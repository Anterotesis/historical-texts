            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To prevent Mistake, and remove Misrepresentation in the Matters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, these are sincerely to Testifie and Declare, That,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> We sincerely own, profess and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess Jesus to be the Christ, even the same Jesus Christ who was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in <hi>Judaea, Matth. 2.</hi> suffered Death upon the Cross without the Gates of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:41162:3"/>
quickned and raised again by the Power of God, and ascended into Heaven and Glory, according to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> We give Witness only to this Christ, as being the very Christ, the only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God and confess both his Coming in the Flesh and in the Spirit, according to holy Scripture-Testimony.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> Though this Christ the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God, took Flesh and came of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Flesh, and suffered death in the Flesh; yet his Flesh (or Body prepared for him) did not see Corruption; it did not corrupt, but was raised again from the dead; consequently did not perish, nor is his Body of a perishing Nature, but a glorified Body, like unto which, we believe, our's shall be changed and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shioned, <hi>Phil. 3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, namely, the holy Doctrine and divine Precepts therein, were first given by divine Inspiration (as we have confessed unto Authority) and in no wise to be contemn'd, but seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously read, believed and fulfilled, as the
<pb facs="tcp:41162:3"/>
Spirit of the Lord giveth Vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Ability, being the Life of the Scripture, and without which the meer Letter and all Preaching therefrom in Man's Will is dead and ineffectual.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>V.</hi> The Protestant Religion considered in the primitive Purity of it (in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to Popery) and all sincere Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, who desire a clear and thorow Reformation from all Idolatry and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, we have a tender Respect to them, and sincerely desire, that the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and the Gospel Ministry, true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, Prayer, Obedience of Faith and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity in its purity may be promoted, grow and increase in Spirit, Life and Power among Christians.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>VI.</hi> The divine Precepts and Doctrine contain'd in the holy Scriptures, we must needs believe to be <hi>Holy and Blessed,</hi> not only because they proceed from the holy Spirit, but also because they require Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Righteousness in Life and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, under the several Dispensations of God to Mankind.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>VII.</hi> We own no such <hi>Saying,</hi> as that the <hi>holy Doctrine or divine Precepts,
<pb facs="tcp:41162:4"/>
of Scripture is either Dust, Death or the Serpents Meat,</hi> but truly profitable to us by the Assistance of God's Holy Spirit given to us; although the false Prophets Preaching was but compared to the Chaff (or Husk) when they stole even the words of the true, <hi>Jer. 23.</hi> And Men of corrupt minds, by perverting the holy Scriptures, and Preaching in their earthly Wisdom from the <hi>Letter</hi> and not from the Spirit of Christ, do bring Darkness and Death over many; and also strengthen the hands of evil Doers, that they may not forsake their Sins, whereby the Serpent, the Enemy of the Soul, is gratified, and many led captivate at his will, when indulg'd and sooth'd up in their sins by such literal and lifeless Preachers, as pervert the holy Scriptures to ther own and others Destruction.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <hi>VIII.</hi> The promised <hi>Messiah,</hi> of whom the holy Prophets give witness, is the very Christ of God, even that Jesus Christ who was born of the Virgin, who in the fulness of time came in the Flesh, and was made like unto us in all things, sin only excepted, as the Scripture testifies.

            <p>BY the way 'tis to be noted, That in this mock Tryal and Court of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, presumptuously Erected and Feigned by <hi>Fr. Bugg.</hi> He makes himself both <hi>Judge, Accuser, Witness</hi> and <hi>Jury,</hi> and also forges the Quakers Answers (without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the least Notice of our own proper Answers to his Objections in our Books, only impertinently cites three or four Lines out of <hi>G. W.</hi>'s <hi>Charitable Essay</hi> for his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>p.</hi> 7. Though in none of these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances cited against us, can we find those words as charged by him, <hi>viz. That the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41162:10"/>
Quakers say, The Holy Scripture is Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Dust, Death and Killeth,</hi> &amp;c. or that they <hi>deny Jesus</hi> to be <hi>The Christ, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis evident, That <hi>F. B.</hi> is not able to make Replication or Answer to our single sheet, Intituled, <hi>A Charitable Essay.</hi> Nor to clear himself from the Arguments and Inversions upon him therein, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his feigned Creed and false Charges against the Quakers, but gives the greatest part of that Sheet (and the most substantial Matters that are in it to clear us) the <hi>go by</hi>; so it remains against him unrefuted.</p>
            <p>His pretended Evidence, <hi>That we deny Christ Jesus,</hi> &amp;c. and that we cannot call <hi>Him</hi> Christ, is from <hi>Isaac Pennington</hi>'s Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions to Professors, wherein he calls the <hi>Body or Flesh</hi> (which the Son of God took upon him) the <hi>Vail, &amp;c.</hi> And what then? Does this prove we deny Christ Jesus, that was born of the Virgin? Did not the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle say, he <hi>consecrated a new and living way through the Vail, that is to say, his Flesh? Heb.</hi> 10.20. Did the Apostle herein deny Jesus to be Christ? No sure.</p>
            <p>But what if <hi>I. P.</hi> said, he could not call the <hi>bodily Garment</hi> or <hi>Vail Christ</hi>? (that is) the <hi>entire Christ</hi>; or the <hi>Body</hi> (which was prepared for him) <hi>chiefly,</hi> and <hi>in the first place, Christ</hi>; as he Explains his own
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:41162:11"/>
words. Does this deny <hi>Him</hi> (the Son of God) to be <hi>Christ</hi>? Surely no. Is the masculine [<hi>Him</hi>] properly relative to the Neuter [<hi>Body</hi>] distinct from the Soul? I do not think that to be proper (or Grammatical) Sence. The word [<hi>It</hi>] is relative to <hi>Body,</hi> but [<hi>Him</hi>] to our Lord Jesus Christ himself. For <hi>Joseph</hi> went unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> and asked the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Jesus,</hi> and took <hi>It</hi> down, and wrapped <hi>It</hi> in a Linnen Cloath and laid <hi>It</hi> in a Tomb, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.52, 53. Which is also called <hi>the Body of the Lord Jesus, Chap.</hi> 24.3. Yet the entire Messiah or Christ of God, is not to be divided in Body or Soul. And <hi>Isaac Pennington</hi> did not say he could not call <hi>Him</hi> Christ, who was both God and Man, <hi>Immannuel</hi> and the Man Christ Jesus the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> His Charge; That the Quakers believe and say, They cannot call <hi>Him</hi> Christ that was born of the Virgin. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find these words either as believed or said by the Quakers in any of <hi>Bugg</hi>'s Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, either out of <hi>Is. Pennington</hi>'s Questions, or any other; and therefore I desire him in his next, to shew me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, where the <hi>Quakers say they cannot call Him Christ, that was born of the Virgin,</hi> &amp;c. if he can, I can as expresly deny that saying; for I have told him
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41162:11"/>
the contrary in my <hi>Charitable Essay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I cannot find (nor believe) that the Quakers call <hi>Geo. Fox the Branch, the Star, the Sun of Righteousness.</hi> In the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance quoted by <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> p. 34. I find not <hi>G. Fox</hi> mentioned in that Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but instead thereof <hi>F. Bugg</hi> questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it in the Margin thus; <hi>viz. Pray who do you account this Branch, if not</hi> G. Fox? <hi>I say, who else did you assign these Titles to? Was it to</hi> G, FOX, <hi>or the Light in him? Pray distinguish in your next.</hi> Thus he now <hi>questions</hi> that which before he has possitively <hi>charged</hi> over and over. Thus instead of Proof, he meerly beggs the Question, and so whirles about begging Questions; and not only so, but (like an unjust Judge) has condemn'd us as <hi>perjur'd Persons, yea, even a pack of false Witnesses and perjur'd Persons</hi> for denying his Charge, p. 33. And this is not all, but he has condemn'd us to the <hi>Pillory</hi> too with his ridiculous Figure thereof, in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Bereans</hi> (as before) But now, upon Tryal and Enquiry, he is fain to question Matters of Fact, after his Condemnation and such his Execution. Thus preposterous is this unjust Judge in his arbitrary Proceedings, and scandalous Treatment against us. And his Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the Quakers <hi>giving Witness to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41162:12"/>
G. Fox Instead</hi> of Christ follows not from such his begging Questions, his lame De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and false <hi>Evidence</hi>; and we are sure it's contrary to our Faith and Testimony— For our Blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, of whom the Holy Scriptures Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, who is the <hi>Branch,</hi> the <hi>Morning Star,</hi> the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and hath spiritually risen both in the <hi>North, South, East</hi> and <hi>West</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and other Parts, even in the Hearts and Souls of many Thousands, and <hi>G. F.</hi> and many others on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Servants and Ministers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s other consequence, <hi>That they</hi> (i. e. Quakers) <hi>put the</hi> North <hi>of</hi> England <hi>for the Town of</hi> Bethlehem. 'Tis also a notorious falshood deduced from his other falshoods, which is but adding one Lie to another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I neither do believe, nor can find, that the Quakers say, <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Body,</hi> either <hi>was,</hi> or <hi>is, of an earthy perishing Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (as <hi>F. B.</hi> hath frequently charged it upon <hi>Isaac Pennington,</hi> and consequently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Quakers Ministers, for his sake, but that the Flesh and Blood of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (and as 'tis in us) is of an Earthly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Nature, whereas Christs Flesh saw no Corruption, it did not Corrupt; <note n="*" rend="inter">
                  <hi>Psa.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Act.</hi> 2.31 and 13.37.</note> And therefore it were a very great Ignorance
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41162:12"/>
and Absurdity for any to say, that his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy (which is chang'd and glorified) <hi>is</hi> of an Earthy and perishing Nature, he being Ascended into Glory. This is answer'd in our <hi>Charitable Essay,</hi> p. 4. and Unrefu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>F. B.</hi> And I still charge it upon him as a Lie, that the Quakers <hi>say</hi> Christ's Body, either was, or now is, of a <hi>perishing Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I do not find in <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi> and <hi>Quotations,</hi> nor yet in any of our Friends Books, that the <hi>Quakers say, The Holy Scripture is either Carnal, Dust, Death, or killeth,</hi> &amp;c. (These are not our Words, he wrongs us in Fact) but that the <hi>Letter killeth,</hi> and is <hi>dead.</hi> And did not the Holy Apostle say, <hi>The Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life?</hi> And did he not <hi>speak of the Ministration of Death Written?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6, 7. Yet he did not contemn, but own the Holy Scriptures, as able to make the Man of God Wise unto Salvation <hi>through Faith in Christ,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.15, 16. In the Book Cited by <hi>F. B. News out of the North,</hi> p. 14. the Words he chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly picks out, and Objects, are, <hi>viz. Their Gospel is dust</hi> [it's not the Gospel] <hi>Mathew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John, which is the Letter</hi> [not their Doctrine, but the meer Letter or Writing.] The Words should rather be thus Transposed, <hi>viz. Their Gospel is dust,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41162:13"/>
who put the Letter (or four Books of Mathew, Mark, Luke and John) for the Gospel,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out distinction. Such also have put the <hi>Letter</hi> or Writings for the <hi>Light,</hi> and the <hi>Letter</hi> for the <hi>Word,</hi> and for the <hi>Gospel,</hi> yea for <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> consequently for Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some clapping hands upon the Book, saying, <hi>This Book</hi> is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the <hi>Gospel,</hi> you must have <hi>Eternal Life</hi> here, such Life-less Preachers we have often met withal.</p>
            <p>Though it's not my place Litterally to excuse these Expressions as laid down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet I cannot take this Instance for any real Proof or clear Evidence of matter of Fact as charged, <hi>viz. That the</hi> Quakers <hi>say, the Holy Scripture is Carnal Dust, Death,</hi> &amp;c. as he chargeth Us; yet if <hi>F. B.</hi> can fairly prove that any of Us have expresly said, or said <hi>That the Gospel-Doctrine contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the four Books of Mathew, Mark, Luke and John is Dust, or but the Letter that killeth.</hi> We do, and shall positively disown it: This I fairly proffer him: However, the said Author's intention and meaning ought justly and charitably to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and compared with some other passages in the said Treatise which I take to be thus, <hi>viz. by Their Gospel is Dust,</hi> i. e. the false Ministers Preaching their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings and immaginations on Scripture for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41162:13"/>
Gospel, and by <hi>Matthew, Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Luke</hi> and <hi>John</hi> being <hi>the Letter,</hi> as not meant either of those holy Men or their Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Doctrine, but to the meer Letter or Writing in the four Books abstractly consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as in Paper and Ink; and false Ministers dead Preaching and Commenting thereupon, without the Spirit, Life or Power of Christ Jesus; like as the false Prophets, who though they stole the true Prophets Words, yet their Preaching was compared but to the <hi>Chaff</hi> (or <hi>Husk, &amp;c.) Jer.</hi> 23.28, 30. Accordingly the same Treatise before quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Reflects on these Hipocrites, <q>Proud, Covetous and Idolatrous Priests, who Preach their own Words, Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Conceivings, painting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the Words of the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles; and teach People, <hi>They shall never overcome their Sins in this Life,</hi> calling such Preaching the Gospel.</q> This is <hi>their</hi> Gospel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended before (<hi>News out of the North,</hi> p. 12, 13, 14.) yet falsely pretend <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to be <hi>their</hi> Gospel.</p>
            <p>There are many substantial living Truths and divine Openings declared and testified in that Treatise, which no doubt proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a Divine Motion. And suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing some accidental Mistakes and Mistrans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41162:14"/>
of Words, and Defects in Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar and Syntax (in the manner of word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) have happened, either in Printing, Transcribing or otherwise, is it just to charge our Principle, or the Author's Intention, therewith.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures themselves have not been wholly free from vain Carpers and Caviller; our Adversary when he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared positively, <hi>That he is not endued with that Spirit the Holy Apostles bad, and that his Reasons against us must needs be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective.</hi> Yet now we must take <hi>his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> that <hi>he has it not by way of Eminency</hi> as they had, <hi>Apol. p.</hi> 2. Yet pretends the <hi>Assistance of God's holy Spirit, p.</hi> 46. Now let's but have the same Liberty to construe our Friends Words as he takes here for his own, and we shall make them look far better then he does, no doubt.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>G. F</hi>'s. respect to the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> I further add, That 'tis well known, it was his frequent and publick Testimony; and in his Books also, <q>That Holy Men of God gave them forth from the holy Spirit; and that they spake and prophesied as they were moved by the Holy Ghost; and that the Scriptures were thus given forth to be Read, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and Fulfilled.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41162:14"/>To return, though it be improper to say, the four <hi>Evangelists</hi> are but the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, because they were holy Men who Preached the Gospel; and their Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Declarations contain evangelical and lasting Truths as declared; yet the four Books, as made up of Paper and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Characters, will decay, wear out and turn to Dust, as many good Bibles have done; as in my <hi>Just Enquiry</hi> is more fully answered, with due respect to the holy Scriptures; <hi>to wit,</hi> the Holy Doctrines and divine Precepts thereof (and to the Books also) as <hi>F. Bugg</hi> also confesses, <hi>viz. G. W.</hi> says, <hi>Though he does not ascribe Holiness to the Paper and Ink or dead Characters; no more do I, nor do I know any body does; but</hi> (says <hi>George) to the holy Doctrine, and blessed Precepts therein contained. which therefore are called holy Scriptures: Very well; here we agree, if</hi> G.

            <p>[Thus far <hi>F.

How now <hi>F. B.</hi> where art thou now with thy Charge and Condemnation of <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Pillory</hi> upon us? Thou hast fairly given
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:41162:15"/>
away thy Cause, and discharged us whom thou hadst unjustly Condemned. Thy Charge is now more remote from Proof than ever it seemed: Therefore I challenge thee to prove that we <hi>say, The holy Scripture,</hi> namely, the holy Doctrine and blessed Precepts, are either <hi>Carnal, Dust, Death, Killing, &amp;c.</hi> We still deny thy Charge herein as false and slanderous, considering the Nature and Import of it, and thou dost but clamour and foam out thy own Shame, in crying out of <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and such a notorious Lye, as the very Heathens would abhor</hi>; and all this for our denying thy notorious Lye, in charging us with <hi>saying</hi> that which we never said nor believed, <hi>viz. That the holy Scripture, namely, the holy Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is Carnal, Dust,</hi> &amp;c. And thy pretended Ten Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to prove thy other false Charge, <hi>That we do not believe the Doctrine and Precepts contained in the Bible, are Holy and Blessed:</hi> They are so shallow and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Reiterations, and begging the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, (as also clamorous) that they are not worth answering, the substance being already answered.</p>
            <p>Only to thy first pretended Reason: There is no proof, that by <hi>the Letter</hi> any of our Friends cited, meant the Doctrine and divine Precepts contained in the Bible,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:41162:15"/>
nor that the Ministers of the <hi>Letter only</hi> were true living Ministers of the <hi>Word</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> or of <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> who is the Word of God. Though some Priests in the <hi>North,</hi> in and before the Year 1653, when those Books, <hi>News out of the North,</hi> and <hi>Saul's Errand, &amp;c.</hi> were Printed, were so ignorant, as to call the <hi>Bible,</hi> namely, the Books made up of Paper, and Ink, and literal Characters, the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi>: Wherein they were oppos'd, Christ being the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel</hi> the <hi>Power of God</hi> which endures for ever, which the Books and Letters or Characters cannot.</p>
            <p>Of his charging these Quakers who <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend plainly to own the Precepts and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Bible to be Holy and Blessed</hi>; yet, that in other Books they <hi>say, 'Tis Dust and Death, the Serpents meat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that to preach out of them, is Conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Apol. Introd. p.</hi> 18. I want still plain Proof of Matter of Fact herein, that we, who are <hi>these Quakers</hi> (so called) say, <hi>The holy and blessed Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is Dust, Death,</hi> &amp;c. Let him produce plain Proof that we say so, or else be ashamed of this his horrid reiterated Slander.</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>Is. Pennington</hi> did in his <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,</hi> take it for granted, that the Names and Titles Jesus and Christ, <hi>chiefly</hi> and in

Is this such a great Error of the Quakers? And must they be Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41162:16"/>
for <hi>Perjury</hi> and unto the <hi>Pillory</hi> for testifying against <hi>F.

O what sad Envy and Confusion is this, poor dark Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slider run into! Who also grants, <hi>That there needed not many Arguments to prove, what he never denyed</hi>; whereas the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were to prove both, that Jesus Christ was before he took the Body of Flesh, and that the names chiefly and in the <hi>first place</hi> belonged to him that took the Body, yet the Body not denied them, <hi>Charitable Essay,</hi> p. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But further, he inveighs against <hi>Isaac Pennington,</hi> viz. <hi>Isaac Pennington</hi>'s Words are, <hi>He took the Flesh and Blood of our Nature, which is of a perishing Nature: Now if he took ours, and ours be of a perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nature,</hi> Ergo, <hi>his was perishing, or it was not of our's, so that</hi> G. W<hi>'s Evasion will not do.</hi> Ibid. p 4.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> by his kind of Logick, has run himself into the same Snare and Error (as he deems it) which he has unduly charged <hi>Isaac Pennington</hi> withal, namely, That if Christ took upon him the Flesh and Blood of our Natures, and our's be Perishing, <hi>Ergo,</hi> his was <hi>perishing</hi>; but he took our's, he cannot deny, he took part of the same Flesh and Blood the Children had, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41162:17"/>
14. Then by <hi>F. B's.</hi> own, <hi>Ergo,</hi> his must needs be of a <hi>perishing Nature,</hi> unless he will whirl about, and unsay what he has said, namely, that it was not of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which Christ took upon him: And then he must deny him to be of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Flesh.</p>
            <p>But I deny <hi>F. B's</hi> Argument in this case, as neither very good Logick, nor true in its self; I deny his <hi>Ergo:</hi> Though the Flesh of our Nature be perishing, as in us, yet it was not <hi>perishing</hi> as assumed by <hi>him (Christ,</hi>) his Flesh, his Body, which he took upon him, saw no corruption, it did not Corrupt; consequently was not perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, much less <hi>is</hi> it now, his Body being changed into a Heavenly, Spiritual and Glorified State; and therefore called, his <hi>Glorious Body,</hi> like unto which our low bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy shall be changed and fashioned, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21.</p>
            <p>The Premises considered, we do solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in the holy fear of God, both te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie against <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s precedent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>That because Christ took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the flesh and blood of our Nature. therefore his was perishing.</hi> 2. Also against his false Affirmation and Testimony against us, <hi>p.</hi> 25. viz. <hi>And thereupon I do affirm and testifie, and charge it upon them in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, Angels and Men, that they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:41162:17"/>
disown and deny Jesus Christ, whom God hath ordained to be Salvation to the ends of the Earth, and a propitiatory, Sacrifice for the Sins of the whole World to be CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[Thus far <hi>F. B.</hi>] But this we utterly deny, and sincerely testifie against, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominably false and presumptuous, as well as Anti-Christian in it self.</p>
            <p>And to his saying, the names <hi>Jesus</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> are given to the <hi>Mediator,</hi> &amp;c. [True, but what follows?] <hi>Therefore,</hi> quoth F.

            <p>And yet he has confessed, it was the Son of God that took the Body, <hi>p.</hi> 4. What confusion and Self-contradiction does the Man blindly run into?

false Witnesses and Perjur'd Persons:</hi> And saith, <hi>Surely</hi> Simon Magus <hi>never exceeded these Impostors,</hi> Act. 8. (Introd. p. 11.15.18.47.) Thus his great Outrage and Impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Malice appears.</p>
            <p>And like a furious Incendiary, to blow up the Fire of Contention and Persecution again, and to incense the Government and Magistrates against us; he does not only call us <hi>New Rome, Rome</hi>'s <hi>Sister,</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us with the <hi>Papists,</hi> as coming, <hi>not one jot behind them, but harmonising with them</hi> (Ep.

How much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling an Incendiary and Seditious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath our Apostate Adversary appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in these Invectives against a peaceable People fearing God, and by his Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence recogniz'd by the Government as <hi>Protestants</hi> also? Though this Incendiary will needs have us Papists. But pray does he therein befriend the Protestant interest, or Government either?</p>
            <p>By thus magnifying or falsly Greatening the <hi>Popish</hi> Interest, as in (and by) a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

who are wholly averse to Popery: Let the wisest in Heart, and impartial Judge, the Nature and tendency of this Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries work of Division and Discord, and whether it will excuse him therein to shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and shroud himself in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to assume the Testimonies of Protestant Martyrs and Authors for his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Authority. Also he might have been so discreet, as not to question, nor upbraid us about, <hi>paying Ten Pounds,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>towards carrying on a Vigorous War against the French King, because scrupling to pay</hi> 2<hi>d. or</hi> 4<hi>d. towards the Militia-Arms, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing us with deluding the World</hi> (p. 65. and 49.) He might in prudence have considered, how far this may affect the Government, under which we live, and Charitably have excused those, who conscientiously scrupling active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to raise or bear Arms, yet in a sense, quietly pay the penalty by patiently suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing distress.

               <hi>F. Bugg</hi> thus grosly reflects upon us, <hi>viz. The more shame for you to be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41162:22"/>
so deceitful, to give in a Testimony so contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to your belief,</hi> p. 40. further, <hi>That this we pretended to the Parliament to serve a Turn,</hi> p. 24.</p>
            <p>Pray observe the horrid Envy and Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of this <hi>Incendiary</hi> herein, and not only the reproach he casts upon us, but what reflection upon the Civil Government? as if the same were deceived and cheated by us, and thereupon granted us our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

O thou Backslider and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man, the Lord rebuke thy envious Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thy deadly Hatred and Outrage! And he will signally rebuke thee, I doubt not.</p>
            <p>And moreover, thou <hi>F. B.</hi> hast no great cause to boast, nor thy Priests to glory in thy <hi>Conversion</hi> to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> from the People called Quakers, with whom thou wast conversant for twenty five Years (as thou pretendest,) if such thy Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was a <hi>being Sold into Aegypt,</hi> as thou hast granted in thy Pamphlet, Stiled, <hi>The Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers detected,</hi> p. 8. by thy applying to thy self <hi>Joseph</hi>'s words, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.20. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 45.5. on which thou sayest, thou canst say as <hi>Joseph</hi> did to his Brethren, <hi>viz.

meant it unto good. Now, therefore be not grieved, nor angry with your selves, that you Sold me hither.</hi> Didst not think this Applicable to thy Condition? If thou didst, then where art thou now, but in <hi>Aegypt?</hi> But we Sold thee not thither; thou art gone down into <hi>Aegypt</hi> for help, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore art not a <hi>Joseph,</hi> who trusted in, and feared the living God. And <hi>woe is to them, that go down into</hi> Aegypt <hi>for help!</hi> Art not thou rather like <hi>Judas,</hi> turn'd to the <hi>Priests</hi> to betray and persecute the Innocent, and to gratifie them that hate us, with thy refuge of Lies and Calumnies? Even against Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent People, unto whose Principle, Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, Doctrine, Ministry, Faith, Love, Unity, Spiritual Testimony (and as being the Church of Christ Jesus) Thou hast made large and solemn Confession, both some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before thou quite left us (in thy Book <hi>De Christina Libertate,</hi> Printed 1682 <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 24, 25, 26, 27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) as also in thy said <hi>Quakers Detected,</hi> Printed in the Year 1686. about two Years after thy Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Church of <hi>England</hi>; wherein thou hast given large Testimony to the Truth of our Principle, and high Commendations of the People called Quakers, their Doctrine and Ministry, as in the beginning, even as being a <hi>Dispensation of the Love of God, sent as a Visitation to Mankind</hi>; together with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:41162:23"/>
their <hi>Christian Society, love unfeigned, and blessed Estate for many Years,</hi> and how <hi>God blessed their Meetings with the comfortable Enjoyments of his Presence</hi>; as may be seen more at large in the said <hi>Quakers Detected.</hi> Insomuch, that thy Self-condemned Back-sliding, Apostacy and Envy against God's People, and Heritage is the more apparent in thy now exclaiming against us for <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Errors, pernicious Principles, Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Heresies, Impostures,</hi> and saying, thou <hi>wast more than</hi> 25 <hi>Years a Member of their Society</hi> (meaning the Quakers) <hi>being carried away with their Dissimulation,</hi> see Title Page of thy <hi>New</hi> Rome <hi>Arraigned</hi>; thus self condemn'd, and self-contradictory thou art.</p>
            <p>And I cannot rationally Perceive; how <hi>F.

            <p n="1">1. As to <hi>Isaac Archer</hi>'s Approbation, <hi>F. B.</hi> saith, he recites only an <hi>Abridgment</hi> thereof, <hi>viz. I do own the substance of this Book, as a defence of those Eternal Truths,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41162:23"/>
by which I hope for Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. But why did not <hi>F. Bugg</hi> recite the whole? Was he so tied up to brevity in this concern, that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his Teacher no more room in a Book of ten or eleven Sheets? But it was very warily done of <hi>Isaac Archer</hi> to own the <hi>substance</hi> of <hi>F. B</hi>'s Book, that is so much of it, as he esteems to be in <hi>defence of those Eternal Truths, by which he hopes to be Saved</hi>; that is, so much of it, as is Scriptural, in behalf of Jesus Christ. But this will not Excuse nor Warrant those circumstantial passages of <hi>F. B</hi>'s, in his Book, which consists of Perversions, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery and false Accusions, and of his Errors justly Inverted upon him, in my <hi>Charitable Essay.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. That <hi>Divine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (so called) who gave his Approbation of <hi>F.

Why does not he appear, and make proof of <hi>F. B</hi>'s malicious confused Work against the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers? He may be ashamed of such his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, if any such pretended Divine did give such Approbation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And if <hi>F. B.</hi> has Letters by him of the same Import, both from <hi>Conforming</hi> and <hi>Non-Conforming</hi> Ministers, what are

            <p>As to <hi>Bugg</hi>'s comparing the People called Quakers, with the <hi>Papists,</hi> as he has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently done, he has fairly contradicted himself therein, by quoting <hi>W.

And what follows, but, <hi>Therefore the People called Quakers are no Papists,</hi> according to <hi>F. B</hi>'s way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; concluding all by one. But many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of our Friends, have sincerely testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied against Popery, Superstition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, both in the root and branch, and for the Protestant Religion, considered in the purity of it; and therefore free from excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Idolatry, as falsly charged on <hi>their</hi> Teachers, in his third charge, <hi>p.</hi> 23.44. which hath been refuted, both in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answers to this false Accuser, as also in our Answer to the <hi>Athenians</hi> (so called) and more particularly in my <hi>Just Inquiry</hi> into the <hi>Libeller</hi>'s <hi>abuse</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 17. to <hi>p.</hi> 30. concerning the pretended Letters of <hi>John Audland</hi> and <hi>Jos.

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41162:30"/>
enlightened them, was sufficient, if obeyed, to lead to Salvation; and that it was the work of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ, to turn the Peoples minds from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; affirming, that this Light was a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Teacher, Leader, and Guide to every Believer, without the help of outward Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, Forms, Orders, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Men; upon these and the like Notions, I became persuaded to make Trial of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; and when I came to see and observe their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

appears on the other side.</hi>] <q>Here was the moving Cause of our Love to God, and one towards another: Even the <hi>inward</hi> Testimony, or Manifestation of his Spirit; which God in his infinite Love hath given us to Profit withal; pursuant to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Promises to our Fathers by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; saying, I will give him for a Light to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and to be my Salvation to the ends of the Earth: I will give him for a Commander and a Leader to my People <hi>Israel.</hi> And as we came to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this Report, and to experience the fulfilling of these Promises; and to be Witnesses of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41162:33"/>
the virtue of his blessed Appearance; so we declare to others, that they might also believe, and have Fellowship with us therein. [<hi>I never understood that</hi> F.

That in all these foregoing, ample and solemn Confessions and Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thou hast given of the Christian Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, Society and Conversation of the said People, and their Ministry (both before and after thou forsook them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the Priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) Thou wast either <hi>Sincere</hi> or <hi>Insincere</hi> therein. To be <hi>Insincere</hi> therein, I suppose thou wilt not charge thy self: If <hi>Sincere,</hi> then thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity was <hi>Insincere</hi> and <hi>Hypocritical,</hi> and Self-condemned; it being thy own and our professed Principle and Testimony in the beginning, and for these many Years, when thou wast conversant among us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy own Confessions made in the Year 1684 and 1686, before and since thy conformity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thy new Pretence, <hi>Thou art not now of the same mind thou wast in, in</hi> 1686, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us in the beginning, and that thou hadst then a charitable Opinion, and better Thoughts of us, with respect to our begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning than now thou hast; and that thou wast in an Error, mistaken, &amp;c.</hi> As in thy <hi>New Rome Vnmasked,</hi> p. 12, 13, 16. Then thy
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41162:36"/>
good and charitable Thoughts of us, our Ministry, Doctrine and Society (respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting our beginning and for many Years) continued until <hi>Anno</hi> 1986, until near two Years after thy conformity. Wherefore thy turning to the Priests and Church of <hi>England</hi> in 1684. proceeded not from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conviction of Conscience, nor from the Spirit of Christ, but self-condemned Hypocrisie and Temporising: For in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the Quakers were in a clear Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the National Priests, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the same is continued by all of them who are sincere and faithful to their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. And that thou knewest, when thou suffered among them for Meeting and Nonconformity, then thou hadst a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony against all Mercenary Priests, against Tythes and their Persecutions, Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Wast thou mistaken therein all that Time? and mistaken in thy Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony for the Light of Christ and our Ministry and Doctrine (as in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) both before and since thy confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity? If so, then why dost thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract thy mistaken Books in that Case? And then who will credit thy Scribling? It seems thou knewest not thy pretended mistake, till some Years after thou hadst turned about and conformed, which if so, it was therefore in a blind Obedience:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:41162:37"/>
Didst thou go blindfold to Church? (so called) Such slim Shifts and mean Subter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuges will not cover or acquit thee from Self-condemnation; nor thy telling us, <hi>Thou art not of the same mind thou wert in in</hi> 1686, <hi>concerning us in the beginning, p.</hi> 12. [Thou art very mutable then, no doubt thy Thoughts grow worse and worse, and thy Charity very cold,] and why so? Why are thy Thoughts grown of late so bad of us? Thou sayest <hi>thou hast of late examined our ancient Errors, and observed the Consequences of them. New</hi> Rome <hi>unmask'd,</hi> p. 12. that is, when we were a true Church, and Christ our Head and Law-giver, found in Doctrine, and Christian in Conversation, Love and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, according to thy own Confessions in 1682. before thou went out to the Parish Church (so call'd) and in 1686. after thou so went out and conformed thereunto. It seems then, thou knewest no such preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Errors in 1686. two Years after thy Revolt and Conformity; then 'twas not Error in Doctrine that was the cause of thy deserting us, and turning to the Priests; what then was it, <hi>outward Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, Forms, Orders, Decrees of Men, Laws, Canons, Ecclesiastical,</hi> &amp;c. as thou pretendest, <hi>Qua. Detect.</hi> p. 3.4.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:41162:37"/>Thou cannot be sincere in any such Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, unless thou hadst conformed to a Church, that hath no Order nor Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; Canons or Rules in it; and where's that Church that will own its self to be without Order or Discipline in it?</p>
            <p>Thy comparing thy Case with Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s and the <hi>Protestant Martyrs,</hi> p. 13, 14. appears more thy Ambition, then Pertinent or Sincere. If Bishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> said, <hi>in the Beginning the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>thought pure and sound Doctrine,</hi> but did he say he was mistaken, and in Error in so saying? No, he own'd her as such; <hi>But after the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>fell into that new unsound Doctrine of Transubstantiation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He disowned Her.</hi> He could be no self-condemn'd Apostate therein, whilst he neither diserted the pure sound Doctrine nor conformed contrary to his own Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony thereunto, (as thou hast done) Thou in Words, hast owned and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of a Church and People, (<hi>i. e.</hi> call'd Quakers) as once pure and sound in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Conversation, both before and since thou left them, and joyn'd to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Opposition to that Church and People; and now to excuse thy whirling about and base temporizing, pretendest thou wast <hi>mistaken,</hi> even in such thy so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Commendation. Thus uncertain
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41162:38"/>
Unstable, Self-contradictory, and self-condemn'd thou art both ways; <hi>Insincere</hi> and <hi>Self condemn'd,</hi> in acting contrary to the Principle, Profession and Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Church and People, whilest high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended by thy Self; and thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearest <hi>a Self Condemned Temporizer,</hi> in retracting <hi>that Commendation,</hi> as an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Mistake; <hi>Self Condemned,</hi> in now pretending thou hast <hi>of Late, examin'd and observ'd our ancient Errors</hi> (as thou callest them.) Being some Passages in some ancient Books, writ by some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Persons, even when we were a Church pure and sound in Doctrine and Conversation, in thy own account, (and as still we are.) That <hi>God Blessed Vs, and our Meetings,</hi> according to thy late Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, as thou hast unfairly snapt and carpt at some Passages or Words out of <hi>G. F.</hi>'s <hi>Great Mystery,</hi> Printed in 1569. <hi>Isaac Pennington</hi>'s <hi>Question to Professors.</hi> Some of <hi>Edward Burrough</hi>'s Books, with more old Books, many Years ago printed, being writ within the compass of those many Years, wherein thou had'st such sweet Conversation, and Divine Blessing among us, long before thou left us, we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thee therein; therefore the Fallacy and Deceit of thy now pretence of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Errors, will not excuse thy Back-sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:41162:38"/>
nor absolve thee from <hi>Self-Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> in thy acting against Light and Conviction, which will pursue thee. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, thou yet confessest <hi>a party of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Quakers, who hold what's sound, and that though they dissent from the establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Religion, yet they hold the true Faith for Substance. New Rome unmask'd,</hi> p. 68. and yet actest contrary to the Faith, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and Practice of those Dissenting Christian Quakers, in thy going to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Churches (or rather Steeple-Houses) wherein they do not follow thee, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy own Confession, thou art gone or sold into <hi>Egypt,</hi> as in thy Qua. detected, p. 8. In applying <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Words to thy Self; Namely, <hi>that thou canst say as</hi> Joseph <hi>did to his Brethren,</hi> Gen. 45.5. <hi>Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with your Selves, that you sold me hither,</hi> though very greatly misapplyed, for we did not sell thee into <hi>Egypt,</hi> but (to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Cross and shun suffering for it,) thou wentest down voluntarily thither for help, which woe is to them that do, and doe thou remember it. Nor is thy Case like that of <hi>Joseph</hi>; for he confest, as that God had a hand in sending him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before his Brethren, for their Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, but thou art gone down into <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> to Revile, Reproach, and Rail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41162:39"/>
thy Brethren, as if thou wouldst incense <hi>Egyptians</hi> against them, even the very Mob or Rabble to destroy them if thou couldst, with thy <hi>Pillory</hi> and <hi>Cage,</hi> &amp;c. to excuse and cover thy wilfull Revolt and Back-sliding, and to extenuate thy Judgment, and Self Condemnation; but the Lord will find thee out, and thou shalt know that thine own Wickedness shall correct thee, and thy Back-sliding shall reprove thee, and the Witness of God will pursue thee to thy Anguish.</p>
            <p>And further to give a summary Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of thy <hi>Self-Condemnation</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postacy,</hi> and where thou art. Thou cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest <hi>Conformity the monstrous Womb, de chr. Lib.</hi> p. 81. and confessest that <hi>Conformity is a Monster, conceiv'd by the great Whore Mystery Babylon,</hi> p. 83. Yet in Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to thy Self, art since confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and consequently joyn'd to a <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> if <hi>Conformity</hi> be it, though thou mightest better have distinguished <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus thou art <hi>Conformed</hi> to shun <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi> thus confused and into <hi>Babylon</hi> thou art run, and in the Cage of unclean and hateful Birds left among whom thou hast unjustly pretended to Cage and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:41162:39"/>Thou hast not only in contempt writ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Conformity,</hi> outward <hi>Prescriptions, Forms, Orders, Decrees</hi> of Men, <hi>Canons, Rules, Laws, Impositions,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>i. e.</hi> in Church-Government and Discipline) in thy several Pamphlets, as <hi>Q. detected, B. Rams, one Blow,</hi> &amp;c. but hast charged us with <hi>Apostacy</hi> therein, and turned from us on that Pretence. Yet in contradiction to thy self, art conformed to a Church and Ministry, which have all these (<hi>i. e.</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Prescriptions, Forms, Orders, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Men, Canons, Rules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) in Church-Government and Discipline, whilst thou canst prove no unjust or unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Canons, Rules, Laws or Methods in our Church, either in Government or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline.</p>
            <p>Thy now Pretence of <hi>false Doctrine, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, Heresie</hi> and <hi>Imposture</hi> against us, is a new Pretence lately taken up for a Cloak to thy Back-sliding and Temporizing, and contrary to thy own Confession as before cited, and therefore no just Pretence, nor true Excuse for thy deserting (or going out from) us, and turning to the Priests. Our Principle, Ministry and Doctrine were true, when thou wast amongst us, when thou left us, and since thou left us; (the same considered as from us Beginning accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy own Confession) and therefore
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41162:40"/>
thou appearest a self-condemn'd Hipocrite. 1<hi>st.</hi> In conforming contrary to thy own Testimony against Conformity to outward Canons, Prescriptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>And mayst thou not justly expect that a certain fearful looking for of Judgment and fiery Indignation, which shall devour Truths Adversaries will surprize and seize upon thee? And I wish all others concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may take timely Warning by thy Fall and Misery.</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>THere are yet two Things remarkable to manifest what Perfection of Malice and Impudence this our persecuting Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> is arrived unto:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> His dedicating his scandalous Book, (hereby answered) unto <hi>Henry Goldwell</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> 
               <hi>A Justice of Peace, and A Member of the House of Commons,</hi> with this Complement, <hi>viz. I have been the bolder, Honoured Sir, to present you with the ensuing Discourse, in hopes of your favourable Construction of my weak Endeavours, and that under your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage they may appear, &amp;c.</hi> Now I am perswaded from some late Discourse which I, and some others of our Friends, had with the said <hi>H. Goldwell</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> that he is a Person so rational, that he must needs justly resent <hi>Bugg</hi>'s boldness herein, as no small Reflection upon him and his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to be thus rendred a <hi>Patronizer</hi> of such a wicked, scandalous and abusive Book, as that of <hi>Bugg</hi>'s is, against a peaceable People, fearing God. But to do the said <hi>H. Godwell</hi> Justice and Right in this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; When three of us shewed him the Injury <hi>Bugg</hi> had done him therein, he signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to us, That he was not made privy to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:41162:41"/>
his Dedication, for he knew not of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came forth; and had shewed his dislike thereof. What a Shame and Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency was it then in <hi>Bugg,</hi> so publickly in Print to <hi>hope for his Patronage,</hi> to make a Person in his Station suspected, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging this our implacable persecuting Adversary, in such his scurrilous and most calumnious Book; hoping that not only this Account may be some reprehension to the said <hi>Bugg</hi>'s presumptuous Insolency: But also, that the said <hi>Justice Goldwell</hi> will farther (in point of Justice) reprehend him, for Imposing such a Dedication upon him for his <hi>Patronage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is farther remarkable, how the said <hi>Bugg,</hi> to vent his inveterate Malice, had the Impudence to deliver an envious, perverse and lying Phamphlet of his own, against the <hi>People called Quakers,</hi> to the Members of the House of Commons, the 16th Instant, [stiled, <hi>Something in Answer to the Allegations of the Quakers, in their printed Case presented to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> Decemb, 1693,] on purpose to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate the said People, and to interrupt and gainsay their <hi>Conscientious Case</hi> for their <hi>not Swearing, &amp;c.</hi> before presented as he saith: Whereby <hi>Bugg</hi> did not only shew himself a busie-body in other Mens Matters,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:41162:41"/>
but also in the very height of deadly Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. Therein falsly accusing the said Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 1. With <hi>Contempt of Scripture and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denances</hi> (without exception.) 2. With <hi>Contempt of the Publick Ministry</hi> (without exception also.) 3. With <hi>Denying Jesus of Nazareth.</hi> 4. With <hi>Contempt of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi>; as if he eagerly thirsted for Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution again for our utter Ruine. Some of his Instances to prove, that <hi>the Quakers deny Jesus of Nazareth,</hi> are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. William Smith<hi>'s asserting something of God in Man, for him to wait to know.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Our knowing Christ the foundation in us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Our believing that Christ in us doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede the Father on our behalf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Edw. Burrough<hi>'s confessing, the very Christ of God to be in us, and that we dare not deny him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Answer formerly given by <hi>James Naylor; viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If I cannot witness Christ nearer than Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, I shall have no Benefit by him; but I own no other Christ but that</hi> (i. e. <hi>Christ) who witnessed a good Confession before</hi> Pilate, <hi>which Christ I witness suffering in me now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These are some of his Instances to prove, that <hi>the Quakers deny Jesus of</hi> Nazareth. Wherefore, according to <hi>F. Bugg</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin (since he turned from the Quakers to the Church of <hi>England</hi>) the ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:41162:42"/>
and Apostolical Doctrin and Confession of <hi>Jesus Christ in you, except ye be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,</hi> and <hi>Christ in you, the hope of Glory, and the Spirit of the Son, as sent into your Hearts, crying Abba Father, and making intercession,</hi> &amp;c. This all (with <hi>Bugg</hi>) is a <hi>denying Jesus of Nazareth.</hi> Oh! horrible Antichristianism and Apostacy. The Lord preserve all honest simple Hearts, from such gross darkness of <hi>Envy</hi> and <hi>Apostacy,</hi> against which I propose, 1. That Christ's being in Glory and Majesty in the Heavens, does not wholly exclude him out of the Souls of his People. 2. That Jesus Christ, who is in his own Glory and Majesty in the Heavens, yet is spiritually in the Hearts of his true Followers, in his Church and San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary, and Minister thereof. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.1, 2.</p>
