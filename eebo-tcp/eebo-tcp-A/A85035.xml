            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

we ſpeak of, called the <hi>plague of leproſie,</hi>
is not what proceeded from natural cauſes

but was immediately inflicted by
Gods hand, <hi>dedecus medicinae,</hi> and a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
if not peculiar diſeaſe to the <hi>Jews,</hi>
not finding in the <hi>Acts,</hi> that the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi>
when preaching to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> out of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine,</hi>
cured any of that diſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I will not ſtir a ſtep farther before I
raiſe one obſervation. <hi>Great is gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that we Engliſh men generally, live now
in the happy ignorance of the heigth of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie.</hi>
I ſay <hi>generally,</hi> a Leper is a rarity, ſome
few in <hi>Cornwell</hi> cauſed, as Phyſitians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from the frequent eating of fiſh new
taken out of the ſea, I ſay <hi>new:</hi> I confeſs
there is <hi>Lazars</hi> Bath, but though the Bath
be there, thanks be to God, but few Lepers.
Indeed ſome hundred years ago, when the
holy war was continued by the Engliſh,
our intercourſe with eaſtern people in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi>
made the leproſie here epidemical,
and <hi>Hugh Orwell</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> dyed
thereof <hi>Anno</hi> 1085. But with the end of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114641:5"/>
that War ended the leproſie of <hi>England,</hi>
as to the generallity and malignity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
Every ſcab, or ſcurf, or ſcale, obſerving
Tydes in the body, is not preſently the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie,
but know, as the <hi>Jews</hi> had a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
we have not, ſo we have a diſeaſe the
<hi>Jews</hi> had not: excuſe me for naming it,
you may eaſily conceive what I would
willingly conceal, it is the laſt rod that
God made therewith to whip wantonneſs,
and which he handſelled on the <hi>French</hi> at
<hi>Naples</hi> two thouſand miles from this place.
How came this malady to climb and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
over the high aſpiring Alpes? when
got into <hi>France? England</hi> being an Iſland
ſecured from the diſeaſes of the continent
how came it to ſwim over into <hi>England,</hi>
did wicked Forreigners bring it hither, or
wanton Engliſh fetch it thence? how ever
it was ſo, it is, and is a diſeaſe ſo much
worſe than leproſice, as ſin is worſe than
ſuffering, tranſgreſſion worſe than affliction.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Now ſhall we make a brief para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:114641:6"/>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Why was not this power rather
committed to a corporation of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as
being too great a charge to be truſted in
one perſon? why were not a veſtry of Lay-Elders
admitted as Aſſiſtants herein.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Prieſt</hi> herein was a Type of
<hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was to be but one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Individual
Perſon, and therefore a ſingle <hi>Prieſt</hi> alone
was employed therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shall look on him.</hi> But what if he were
blind as in the caſe of <hi>Eli? 1 Sam.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Commisſion of trying</hi> was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the High <hi>Prieſts</hi> or one of his Sons,
as it is <hi>verſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the 2. who in ſuch a caſe was
to officiate for his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Look.</hi> Herein 2. things conteined, the
inſpection of the eye, and the circumſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the judgement. For the latter the
<hi>Prieſt</hi> might not proceed on his own Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
principles, but was confined to Gods
directions preſcribed unto him; and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
he diſcovered it by 3. ſignes 1. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
by the ſubſidency or the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the malady when it intrenched it
ſelf in pits and holes made in the fleſh.
2. Diffuſion, when the malignity thereof
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114641:6"/>
contained not it ſelf to the firſt place, but
dilated it ſelf over the body. 3. Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loration,
when the hair therein was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
white, arguing the debility of nature,
white commonly a colour of innocence,
now of infection; commonly the livery of
chearfulneſs, now of ſadneſs; a black white,
ſable and ſorrowfull.</p>
            <p>Now whereas the <hi>Priest</hi> was to look on
the Party truſting no other evidence than
his own eyes, we learn mens cenſures muſt
not go on <hi>heare-ſays</hi> but be grounded on

               <hi>Pronounce.</hi> That is poſitively and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly;
he was not to mutter his ſentence,

            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion.</hi> How came it to paſs that the

Armour againſt an infection. One in his
calling is armed, out of his calling is naked;
at leaſt laſily following his calling, his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
like <hi>Ahabs,</hi> is not cloſe joynted, and
he left woundable in the internal chinks:
with what confidence do we ſee Brick-lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
Carpenters, Plummers <hi>&amp;c.</hi> clambering
up high pinnacles, and walking in narrow
places, where our feet cannot ſtand theirs
will run; double the cauſe thereof, a lawfull
calling &amp; long cuſtome which hath inured
them thereunto. Thus ſearchers are not
ſo ſoon infected with the plague. I confeſs
the plague is reſembled to fire, ſave that it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114641:7"/>
burneth green wood ſooner than dry, and
young people more ſubject to be tainted
than old; however this is not the main
reaſon why ſuch ſearchers eſcape, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in their vocation.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters under the goſpel have
not the like calling, and therefore not the
like warrant to approach infectious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
And we may remember the ſtory of
Mr. <hi>Stafford</hi> (Divinity Profeſſour in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>)
who to convert Sir <hi>Henry</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer
(the ſtory in Mr. <hi>Fox</hi>) loſt his own
life. Come we now to the ſecond part, the
<hi>condemnation</hi> and pronounce him unclean,
<hi>him,</hi> be he friend or foe, high or low, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
partial reſpecting of perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doctrine.</hi> Gods miniſters ought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
fear or favour to perform their office,
neither to be frighted nor flattered. It is
obſerved that <hi>Moſes</hi> firſt hanſelled this
Law on his Siſter <hi>Myriam, Numb.</hi> 12. 15.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we finde it ſerved by Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
on their Soveraign in the caſe of <hi>King
Uzziah,</hi> 2 Chron. 26. 20.</p>
            <p>Obſerve herein the <hi>Prieſt</hi> thruſted him out

ſeeing the high <hi>Prieſt</hi> did it in obedience to
an higher <hi>Kings</hi> command, yea <hi>Uzziah</hi>
ſenſible of his ſin, ſaith the Text, haſted out
himſelf. Gods ſervants left to themſelves
may fall into ſin, but when it is diſcovered
unto them, as they run into it, if poſſible
they would fly out of it.</p>
            <p>Doctrine. <hi>Sad and ſorrowfull the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a ſequeſtred Leper.</hi> Indeed ſome of us
have been ſequeſtred, and bleſſed be God
we have born our yoke in our youth, hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that more freedom is reſerved for our
old age, but our ſequeſtration is not to
be named with that of a leper, whoſe ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
conſiſteth in four particulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, they were debarred the acceſs to
the place of Gods publick worſhip, and
might not approach the Temple, nor be
preſent at their ſacrifices, nor partake of
the Paſsover.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they were debarred from the
embraces of their neareſt relations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they could not expect cure
but by miracle. Heavens hand, which laid
it on, could onely take it off: nor was a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114641:8"/>
capable of the benefit of the pool of
<hi>Betheſda,</hi> not but that undoubtedly cured
if caſt firſt into it, but becauſe thoſe por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<hi>John</hi> 5. 3. Contained onely the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,
blinde, halt, withered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion.</hi> Whether lepers were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into the ſociety.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, dying lepers they were not
buried with other people. Thus <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi>
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 23. <hi>Was buried with his Fathers
in the field belonging to the Kings, for they
ſaid he was a Leper,</hi> in the ſuburbs of
the place of ſepulture.</p>
            <p>This ſerveth for a ſufficient warrant to
juſtifie this City in a practiſe which ſome
do behold as over rigid and ſevere, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſhutting up of infected perſons at
the beginning of the plague; ſome would
have the ſick and the ſound to go promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly
together, as they do at <hi>Grand
Cairo</hi> in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Indeed if they be poor
to ſhut them up in their houſes and to
ſhut up relief from them is murder, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
if well conſidering, they have no cauſe
of juſt offence who ſo are ſhut up from
publick ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:114641:9"/>
Here give me leave to take an occaſion
to raiſe the gratitude of this City to God.
He that with <hi>Jeſs</hi> paſſeth for an old man
in <hi>London,</hi> cannot remember it ſo long
without the plague, this City was never
more populous, ſurely there being more
hives there are as many Bees: dayly increaſe
of houſes argues no decreaſe of Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds.
Secondly, never more filth, the
kennels and ſtreets are not kept more clean
than before. Thirdly, never more ſinfull, as
much pride as ever though removed from
thoſe whoſe births ſtill may, and whoſe
ſtate did once countenance gallantry to
ſuch who growing great will grow gaudy
in an inſtant.</p>
            <p>Gracious Gods goodneſs, who ſent <hi>Chriſt</hi>
in the fleſh to cure both our corporal and
ſpiritual leproſie: I ſhall confine this dayes
Sermon according to promiſe, onely to
corporal leproſie: Herein obſerve the firſt
particularized miracle, having the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
thereof related in the firſt goſpel
which our Saviour did, was on a leper <hi>Mat.</hi>
8. 2. <hi>And he gave him in charge to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the Prieſt, and to offer the gift which</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:114641:9"/>
Moſes <hi>cammanded for a teſtimony unto
them.</hi> A teſtimony not ſo much to teſtifie
that the party was not palliately but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
cured, but for a teſtimony to the
<hi>Prieſt</hi> to evidence to them, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was
come in the fleſh, the expected <hi>Mesſia,</hi> as
appeared by his miracles, and had they
not been willingly and willfully blind,
barring and bolting their eyes againſt the
beams of truth, they could not but be
ſenſible that the <hi>Saviour of mankind</hi> was
come. Surely the ſacrifice for the cleanſing
the Lepers <hi>Levit.</hi> 14. 4. formerly ſeldom
uſed, when God, thrifty of his miracles, was
pleaſed now and then to drop down one
from <hi>Heaven,</hi> began now to be ſo ordinary
with the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that it could not but mind
them that the <hi>Mesſiah</hi> was come.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Chriſt</hi> cured more lepers at
once than of any other diſeaſe; <hi>Chriſt</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
two blinde men together, <hi>Math.</hi> 9. 27.
two men poſſeſſed with Divels, <hi>Math.</hi> 8. 28.
whilſt he healed a whole ſociety of Lepers
(poor people being parted from all others,
it was ſome comfort to them to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
together) <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 12. ten at a time,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114641:10"/>
on that ſad token that nine of them proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
unthankfull.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in the <hi>Commiſsion</hi> to the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples,
Math.</hi> 20. 8. <hi>Heal the ſick,</hi> it follows,
<hi>cleanſe the Lepers.</hi> The <hi>curing</hi> of that <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady</hi>
alone (with the <hi>caſting out of Divels</hi>)
are expreſſed in <hi>particular words,</hi> all the
reſt in <hi>general terms.</hi> Either to ſhew that
more than ordinary power was requiſite
for the healing thereof, or that <hi>leproſie-cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
was their proper and peculiar maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
to evidence to all, that they were ſent
by him whoſe calling was to cure the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie
of our ſouls.</p>
            <p n="1">1. COme we now to handle theſe
words <hi>Analogically</hi> conceiving
them of ſufficient latitude, to give us juſt
occaſion to enter on the enquiry, whether
<hi>Gods Miniſters</hi> under the <hi>goſpel</hi> have a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>commiſsion</hi> to examin, and exclude
Perſons from the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> But firſt let
me acquaint the <hi>Audience</hi> with the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of my intentions herein.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There was a ſect of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which were none of the four

               <hi>Elemental ſects</hi> of <hi>ſtoicks, Peripateticks, Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demicks</hi>
&amp; <hi>Epicures.</hi> Theſe would be bound
to no one opinion that any of the other
maintained; only they would be left at large
to <hi>pick</hi> &amp; <hi>choſe</hi> what they conceived ſound
and ſolid in any of their opinions, refuſing
the reſt what they eſteemed otherwiſe. In a
word, theſe <hi>Eclectici</hi> were the <hi>Quint-eſſence</hi>
of the former four <hi>Sects</hi> of <hi>Philoſophers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. I intend in like manner to be a
<hi>Chooſer</hi> in this point. (Grand the difference
betwixt a <hi>Chooſer,</hi> and a <hi>Seeker</hi> of our age,
the former is <hi>poſitive,</hi> the latter <hi>ſceptical,</hi>
hovering over all, ſetling on nothing) I
know no reaſon that we are bound to take
one and all in any perſwaſion. Three great
Intereſts may be named in <hi>England,</hi> one
that was the <hi>Prelatical,</hi> one that is the
<hi>Presbyterian,</hi> one that would be the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant.</hi>
I ſhall embrace what I find in
any of their practiſes commendable, and
conſonant to <hi>Gods word,</hi> making uſe of my
<hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> to leave the reſt which in
my <hi>weak judgement</hi> may ſeem ſubject to
juſt exception.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Propoſition, <hi>there is no pregnant</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:114641:11"/>
               <hi>place of Scripture which expreſly impower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Miniſters of the goſpel with authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Examination and Excluſion from the
Sacrament:</hi> I have looked for it in the
place where I was moſt likely to finde it,
namely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> at
large condemneth the abuſes at the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in their <hi>Church.</hi> Here I expected the
<hi>Corinthian Miniſters</hi> ſhould have been
checkt for keeping no <hi>ſtricter guard</hi> about
<hi>Gods Table,</hi> and that the main fault of this
prophaneneſs ſhould be charged on their
negligence. What ſaid <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abner</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. 16. When he fetcht the <hi>Spear</hi>
and <hi>Cruſe of water,</hi> from the head of <hi>ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Saul? Ye are worthy to die, becauſe you
have not kept your maſter, the Lords anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
ſuch a ſharp reproof I expected from
S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>miniſters</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> for
being no more vigilant (as being Gods <hi>life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard</hi>)
in ſecuring the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>bloud</hi> of
<hi>Chriſt</hi> from <hi>unworthy Communicants.</hi> But
not the leaſt check to them, onely a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
exhortation to others to examin
themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Propoſition <hi>there are ſome places of</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:114641:11"/>
               <hi>Scripture which by proportion and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
do more than probably inſinuate ſuch
a power in the Miniſter.</hi> Firſt for examining
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. <hi>Obey them that have the rule
over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they
watch for your ſouls, as they that muſt give
account that they may do it with joy, and not
with grief, for that is unprofitable for you.</hi>
God foreſeeing that in after-ages the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter</hi>
in a <hi>Church</hi> might be but <hi>One,</hi> the
<hi>Pariſhioners</hi> many, <hi>he</hi> perchance <hi>poor, they
rich, he</hi> poſſibly <hi>young, they grave,</hi> and <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi>
ſaw there would be an humour of
oppoſition in them to ſubmit to their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtour,</hi>
and therefore thought it neceſſary
to leave this command on record. Now the
beſt <hi>Auditour</hi> cannot give an account of
them whoſe receipts and expences he hath
not examined, and therefore by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
it may be collected that they may
and muſt try the conditions and abilities
of their people, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 21. <hi>Be thou dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to know the ſtate of thy Flocks, and look
well to thy heards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Secondly, for <hi>Excluding,</hi> where
be it premiſed, that if an <hi>Examining power</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:114641:12"/>
can be demonſtrated in the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> a
power of Excluſion doth by neceſſary and
undeniable conſequence follow thereupon:
For the <hi>Miniſters Examination</hi> would be
altogether uſeleſs, if ſuch, who thereby ſhall
be detected unfitting or unworthy may in
defiance of the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> intrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>Communicants</hi> to the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
If therefore the <hi>Miniſters Examination</hi> be
as a <hi>weapon</hi> without an edge, and be onely
to make a noiſe without any further power,
it would render him ridiculous to <hi>Prophane
perſons,</hi> and expoſe his <hi>pains</hi> and <hi>profesſion</hi>
to contempt. Surely therefore, his <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
is ſeconded and attended with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to <hi>admit</hi> and <hi>exclude</hi> from the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi>
as he findeth perſons fit or unfit
for the ſame.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Of places importing an</hi> Excluding

And Jehojada ſet the Porters at the gates

            <p>To theſe add the words of my <hi>Text,
And the Prieſt ſhall look on him;</hi> There is
<hi>Examination,</hi> and <hi>pronounce him unclean,</hi>
there is <hi>Excluſion.</hi> Yet let not too much
improvement be made of thoſe words, leſt
they ſtretch ſo far as to break. If the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
be applied in all particulars, the
<hi>High Prieſt</hi> alone, being impowered with
this authoritie, will advance the <hi>Hierarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
power</hi> farther than ſuch as make uſe
of this place will well approve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> You have out of ignorance or
envie, concealed one of the moſt effectual
<hi>Scriptures</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> inſtructing
<hi>Miniſters</hi> with an <hi>Examining power</hi> of all
in the <hi>Flock,</hi> namely, 1. Pet. 3. 15. <hi>Be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
always to give an anſwer to every one
that asketh you a reaſon of the hope of that
is in you with meekneſs and fear.</hi> It ſeems
you are <hi>willingly ignorant</hi> (to uſe the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know many behold it as the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114641:13"/>
               <hi>Champion of their cauſe,</hi> and have uſed it to
order their <hi>refractorie Pariſhioners</hi> into <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.</hi>
For my own part I look on it
as nothing to the purpoſe. It is better to
fight naked, than with bad <hi>Armour.</hi> For
the rags of a bad <hi>Corcelet,</hi> make a deeper
wound, and worſe to be healed than the
bullet it ſelf. None ſuch foes to a cauſe as
ſuch friends who will defend it, <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentis

<hi>when men ſuffer for righteouſneſs

Beſides, the command being general, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
are as much obliged thereby to give
an anſwer to their Pariſhioners, if asking
them as Pariſhioners, are bound to give an

men being oppreſſed above their ſtrength,

forth into <hi>mad extravagancies.</hi> Now ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
formerly ſhewed how Mad-men are
to be prohibited the <hi>Communion,</hi> quod ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:114641:15"/>
               <hi>more ſo. Oppreſſors</hi> ſure ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.
But alas! in all ages ſuch their power,
that if pleaſed, they will command their

the Miniſters oppoſition, God alone being
able to puniſh their <hi>preſumption</hi> therein.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the ſin muſt be notorious, <hi>quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad

taken thereof, to the <hi>publick ſcandal</hi> of the
<hi>Congregation.</hi> If it be done in a corner
known to few, no pregnant proof nor pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
appearance thereof, the admiſſion of
ſuch an offender, is ſo far from being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
to the Church, that the excluſion of
him, will rather be ſcandalous: But where
notice of the fault is arrived at many, and
the noyſe thereof at more, amounting to a
conſiderable part of the Congregation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in qualitie or number, there lyeth a
juſt prohibition againſt the receiving of
ſuch an offender.</p>
            <p>When therefore the <hi>drunkard</hi> ſhall hold
his <hi>quaffing-cup</hi> in the one hand, and yet
deſire to take the <hi>Chalice</hi> in the other, when

deſire the <hi>bloud of Chriſt</hi> to be tendered

when any <hi>offender</hi> with the <hi>Adultereſs</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>This libertie was allowed the Miniſters

               <hi>Rubrick. And if any of thoſe be an open and

having knowledge thereof, ſhall call him, and
advertiſe him in any wiſe not to preſume to

            <p>Now becauſe onely ſins notorious, <hi>quo

            </p>
            <p>Propoſ. 6. <hi>Young people,</hi> be they never

And although it apears not in the Text
that ſuch <hi>catechiſing</hi> of him was done by
the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> yet it is eaſie to prove out of
<hi>primitive antiquitie,</hi> that <hi>Catechumeni</hi> was
a degree of young <hi>Chriſtians Candidates</hi>
for the <hi>ſacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here it were to be wiſhed, that <hi>Miniſters</hi>
queſtions in this caſe might be confined, if
not to <hi>ſacramental,</hi> yet to <hi>ſoul-concernment.</hi>
They are not to come to the people as the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114641:16"/>
               <hi>Queen of Sheba</hi> did to <hi>Solomon,</hi> to urge
them with hard queſtions, 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 9. 1.
nor to propound <hi>riddles</hi> to them as did
<hi>Sampſon</hi> to his thirtie <hi>Companions,</hi> Judges
14. 32. but onely to demand of them ſuch
eſſential points of <hi>Religion,</hi> the not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or ill holding whereof, maimeth the
<hi>vitals</hi> of the <hi>ſoul</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſpeak it upon the complaint of thoſe
(whoſe report with me is above exception)
how many difficult, yet frivolous queſtions
have been propounded unto them; as what
God did before he created the world?
Where the ſoul of <hi>Lazarus</hi> was in the three
days interval, whileſt his bodie lay in the
<hi>grave?</hi> A queſtion which he who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
it, I believe was as ignorant of, as
the partie to whom it was propounded.</p>
            <p>Others have been too <hi>ſtern,</hi> and <hi>moroſe</hi>
in not accepting true and pertinent anſwers,
if not coming up to the very top of what
was demanded. Thus when one was ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what God was, the partie no leſs mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly
than truly replyed, <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> to
whom the <hi>Miniſter</hi> returned, and ſo is the

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:114641:17"/>
               <hi>ſpirit</hi> which rather deſerved encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

And if they can be challenged, they
fall under our former exception.</p>
            <p>This laſt Propoſition is grounded on
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114641:17"/>
that <hi>Foundation</hi> which few of the <hi>Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
partie uſe to denie, namely, that they,

have it; and are rather finally improved
than impared therein, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 92. 14. <hi>They
ſhall ſtill bring forth fruit, they ſhall be fat

charitably to preſume (nothing appearing

move a progreſſive, not a retrograde
motion in pietie: eſpecially if he conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>I ſay ſuch are not <hi>of neceſsitie</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examined
by the <hi>Miniſter.</hi> Indeed, if out

I commend their <hi>meekneſs,</hi> and account it
an <hi>acceptable offering</hi> in the eyes of God.
However their act ought not to be <hi>obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie</hi>

               <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. To confute ſuch who are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiſs
in adminiſtering the <hi>ſacrament,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114641:18"/>
no more than the general profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Chriſtianitie, a reverend poſture of
the bodie, &amp; a hand reached out to receive,
to qualifie one for a <hi>Communicant.</hi> Theſe
make the <hi>Lords table</hi> a Pandocheon, an
<hi>Inne</hi> to entertain all, &amp; <hi>Chriſt</hi> to keep <hi>open
houſe</hi> at the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> and yet we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
a great difference between the places
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> preaching, and adminiſtering the
<hi>ſacrament.</hi> He preached often <hi>ſub dio, in
the open air</hi> where nothing confined <hi>his
voice</hi> but <hi>his voice,</hi> as extending <hi>audible</hi> (at
leaſt <hi>intelligible</hi>) no farther. Thus <hi>Matth.</hi>
5. 1. <hi>He went up into a mountain and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
Matth. 13. 2. <hi>He went into a Ship and
ſate, and the whole multitude stood on the
ſhore.</hi> But when he adminiſtered the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
to ſome ſelect perſons, then he made
choice <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>of an upper chamber
trimmed and prepared, purpoſely made readie
for them,</hi> of far leſs latitude, and receipt as
capable, onely of the company intended
preſent at that exerciſe. To ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſiveneſs
of the <hi>Word</hi> to all that pleaſe
to hear the ſame, the <hi>contractedneſs</hi> of the
<hi>Communion,</hi> confined onely to ſuch as in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114641:18"/>
ſome meaſure are fitted for the receiving
thereof.</p>
            <p>The maintainers of this Opinion of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous
Communions,</hi> proceed upon a <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
error.</hi> Firſt, on the example of <hi>Judas,</hi>
one of the worſt of men, yet not thought
bad enough by <hi>Christ</hi> himſelf to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>the ſacrament.</hi> Here they take that for
decided which is diſputed, that for conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
which is controverted, <hi>adhuc ſub Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
lis eſt,</hi> it hangeth as yet on the file, and
the number and worth of ancient <hi>Writers</hi>
on the negative, are almoſt even with thoſe
which affirm his receiving. But ſuppoſe he
did receive the <hi>ſacrament,</hi> (which in my
particular opinion I do believe) it maketh
nothing for the advantage of thoſe which
urge it in this behalf.</p>
            <p>For, Firſt, <hi>Judas</hi> was compleatly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for a <hi>Communicant,</hi> firſt with <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi>
whereof he had too much, except he
had uſed it better, whoſe <hi>eminent parts</hi>
were like unto thoſe <hi>torches</hi> and <hi>lanthorns</hi>
abuſed by him to apprehend and betray
our <hi>Saviour.</hi> Secondly, with ſuch <hi>ſeeming
holineſs,</hi> that none of his <hi>Fellow-diſciples</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:114641:19"/>
could deteſt, or did ſuſpect him for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs:
Elſe needleſs had the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
been of <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> John 13. 25.
<hi>Lord who is it?</hi> had he not carried it ſo
cunningly that no common jealouſie cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
on him as a <hi>Traitor in intention.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. Chriſt</hi> as <hi>God</hi> knew <hi>Judas</hi> to be
an <hi>Hipocrite</hi> and a <hi>Devil,</hi> and yet he would
not denie him the <hi>ſacrament,</hi> to ſhew, that
the worſt and wickedeſt of men may be
admitted thereunto.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Indeed as God he knew it, but it
is queſtionable whether he communicated
this knowledge to his humanitie, and if ſo,
yet might not be pleaſed to take notice
thereof at the inſtant of Inſtituting the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi>
Becauſe therein <hi>Chriſt</hi> would do
nothing but what ſhould be precedential to
poſteritie to imitate: as intending that
meer men ſhould afterwards follow him in
the <hi>Miniſterie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second falſe principle that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons</hi>
of <hi>Promiſcuous ſacraments</hi> proceed
upon is this, that the <hi>Lords ſupper</hi> is as well
a <hi>converting,</hi> as a <hi>confirming Ordinance,</hi>
from whom (till we be better informed) we
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114641:19"/>
muſt be forced to diſſent. Here, far be it
from us to minorate or leſſen the efficacie
and operativeneſs of the meaneſt of Gods
<hi>Ordinances,</hi> and on the other ſide, we muſt
be wary, leſt we extend their power too far,
to the endangering of peoples ſouls.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Word of God</hi> is the onely ordinarie
means of <hi>converſion</hi> known unto us. This
<hi>pearl,</hi> though caſt before <hi>ſwine,</hi> may turn
the ſwine into the ſheep, and by Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
alter and better their propertie. Nor
is any other previous qualification requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by an Auditor of Gods word, but meer
hearing the ſame, which may put life into
thoſe who were dead in treſpaſſes, in ſins.
But Food and Phyſick (for ſuch is the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>)
if not given to ſuch who have life
to take and digeſt them, is altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.
The firſt muſt have faith &amp; repentance
who expect to reap any benefit thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> The <hi>ſacrament</hi> is alſo a <hi>convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
means,</hi> becauſe in the adminiſtration
thereof, many excellent paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are intermingled. Formerly, when the
<hi>Liturgie</hi> was in full practice, ſeveral Texts
of moſt ſignal comfort were interwoven
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114641:20"/>
by the <hi>Miniſter</hi> in his <hi>preparative addreſſes</hi>
thereunto, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 28. <hi>Come unto me all
that travel,</hi> &amp;c. John 3. 16. <hi>So God loved
the world,</hi> &amp;c. 1. Tim. 1. 15. <hi>This is a true
ſaying, and worthy,</hi> &amp;c. 1. John 2. 1, 2. <hi>If
any man ſin, we have an advocate with the
Father,</hi> &amp;c. Now theſe paſſages of Gods
word (which ever hath a converting vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
virtue in it) may on a ſudden ſurpriſe
the ſoul of a notorious ſinner preſent at the
Sacrament, &amp; effectually work an amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in him. And although, ſince the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> the reading of thoſe
numerical places be disuſed, yet one may
confidently preſume, that no <hi>Miniſter</hi> of
the <hi>Presbyterian perſwaſion,</hi> doth or can ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
adminiſter the Sacrament, but in
his prayers before and after the ſame he
inſerteth ſelect Scriptures to that purpoſe.
wherefore the receiving of the Sacrament,
if not in it ſelf, by neceſſarie conſequence,
as attended with Scripture (in the due cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
thereof) is a converting Ordinance,
and therefore an uſurpation to forbid any,
the worſt of men admittance thereunto.</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>The Word of God</hi> looſeth the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:114641:20"/>
               <hi>power</hi> thereof, when uſed <hi>againſt
the word of God;</hi> I mean, when applyed
contrarie to thoſe directions, which the
<hi>Scripture</hi> commendeth unto us. For every
Communicant is commanded to examin
himſelf, and to diſcern the Lords bodie,
and to eat the ſame worthily. Duties
which meer unconverted perſons, in the
ſtate of nature, are utterly unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.
Theſe things are not to be wrought
there, but brought thither. Indeed the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi>
will multiplie, but not make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
but not create grace in the hearts
of <hi>Receivers.</hi> Such therefore, who come
not qualified for <hi>Communicants,</hi> cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
converting from the <hi>ſacrament,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they break the Word of God in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
there. As for thoſe excellent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of Scripture, uſed by <hi>Ministers</hi> offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
in the <hi>ſacrament,</hi> it is to be feared
they will rather turn the ſavour of death
unto death, and give Satan a larger power
over thoſe unconverted perſons which
preſs to thoſe myſteries.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But I know that <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>learning</hi>

            <p>This premiſed (to prevent perſonal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions

not ſo neceſſarie for the <hi>growth of grace</hi> as
heretofore was generally <hi>preached</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.
Lay-people</hi> (which <hi>phraſe</hi> I uſe not
for any fondneſs I have thereunto, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
generally uſed and underſtood) ſeeing
<hi>Conſcientious Miniſters</hi> debar their people
thoſe <hi>holy Myſteries,</hi> meerly for a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
matter, begin to thin, that <hi>receiving</hi>
is but a matter of indifferencie, which may
or may not be uſed without great gain or
loſs to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:114641:22"/>
Secondly, it hath made <hi>ſacraments</hi> to be
long disuſed in ſome places, to the great
grief of many <hi>godly perons.</hi> I could never
read that paſſage <hi>Acts</hi> 27. 33. but with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration.
<hi>This day,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, is the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
day which ye have tarried and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
faſting, having taken nothing.</hi> Strange
that life could conſiſt with ſo long abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie.
I confeſs, men in the <hi>Southern
parts</hi> have not ſo <hi>active ſtomachs,</hi> as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
&amp; extenuated with heat. I confeſs
alſo, that having, as one may ſay, a <hi>ſurfet of
ſorrow,</hi> they had no mind to meat; as little
joying to feed themſelves as to feed <hi>fiſhes;</hi>
expecting dayly to be drowned. Yet all
things put together, we cannot underſtand
their <hi>fourteen days faſting</hi> otherwiſe, but
that in ſuch a term they made no <hi>ſet and
ſtanding meals.</hi> They did not comfortably
enjoy themſelves at any <hi>juſt refection;</hi> but
fed <hi>privately</hi> and curſorily as their occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
would give them leave, without any
delight, meerly for the maintenance of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>But behold a <hi>greater wonder,</hi> for ten
years, I dare bodly ſay, ſome <hi>Pariſhes</hi> in
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114641:23"/>
this <hi>Citie</hi> have faſted from the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
I will not excuſe the peeviſhneſs of ſuch
people, who on the <hi>punctilio</hi> of <hi>reexamina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
deprive themſelves of ſo great a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
But that the guilt may fall the lighter
on either, let it even be parted betwixt
both <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>People</hi> as faultie herein. I
know not what hard ſhift ſuch people have
made (perchance privately in their houſes,
ro elſe in other Pariſhes) to be <hi>clandeſtine
comunicants,</hi> as I may term them, what <hi>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-meals</hi>
they have made I know not, ſure
I am they have not ſat down at Gods
board in their own <hi>Pariſh</hi> for many years, a
wonder indeed if well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered. However,
this is moſt injurious, if the <hi>Drones</hi> will not
feed, that the <hi>Bees</hi> ſhould be famiſhed.
<hi>That be far from you my Brethren to do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner, to starve the righteous with
the wicked, and that the righteous ſhould be
as the wicked, that be far from you.</hi> What
if ſuch the <hi>fault worthy ſtubbornneſs</hi> of
ſome as not to ſubmit themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examination,
muſt Communions be wholy
neglected? and humble people, who on any
terms are willing to receive the Sacrament,
be debarred the benefit thereof?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:114641:23"/>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Should <hi>ſacraments</hi> be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred,
and any <hi>profane perſon</hi> preſs in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
there preſence would infect all the
reſt how good ſoever, contracting <hi>guilt</hi> to
themſelves from the companie of thoſe
unworthy <hi>perſons</hi> with whom they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate?
Better therefore is a <hi>total ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi>
in ſuch a caſe, than a <hi>ſinfull receiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Poſition is moſt falſe, that
<hi>mixt Communions</hi> do infect. For when firſt
our aforeſaid cautions have been obſerved,
if in defiance of the <hi>Miniſters</hi> care and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> an unworthy
perſon ſhall chance, either cunningly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate,
or violently to intrude himſelf, his
guilt is on his own head, and he alone an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Surely the man at the <hi>Marriage-feaſt,</hi>
Matth. 22. 12. <hi>wanting the Wedding-gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
had many in the ſame <hi>meſs</hi> (for

               </gap>, the Table was <hi>furniſhed</hi> with

yet none of theſe were taken to task, or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114641:24"/>
called to account, but he alone who came
thither unqualified, as wanting a habit ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie
at ſuch entertainments.</p>
            <p>And here let me be your <hi>Remembrancer</hi>
of an <hi>humble meditation,</hi> ſeaſonable for ſuch
who maitain that <hi>mixt communions</hi> convey
contagion to all <hi>receivers.</hi> It were no leſs
<hi>pious</hi> than <hi>profitable</hi> for the beſt of them to
be <hi>jealous</hi> over themſelves with a <hi>godly
jealouſie,</hi> and to fear leſt their own badneſs
ſhould derive infection to their <hi>Fellow-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants.</hi>
Surely S. <hi>Paul</hi> in holy humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
ſaid of himſelf, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>Christ
came to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief.</hi>
Contrarie to which, there thoughts are
wholy taken up with ſuſpicions of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
from others.</p>
            <p>The third miſchief which the <hi>disuſing of
ſacraments</hi> hath done, is that thereby our
<hi>Adverſaries</hi> of the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a great advantage. This is a true <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime,
A lean Communion maketh a fat
Maſs;</hi> and many are fallen off to <hi>Papiſtrie</hi>
on this occaſion. Let none ſay, we will
eaſily convert them with <hi>penal ſtatutes,</hi> or
elſe the more <hi>Papiſts</hi> the more <hi>payments</hi> to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114641:24"/>
the preſent neceſſities of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi>
Surely ſuch a thought never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into the breaſt of any <hi>Godly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our:</hi>
and the <hi>Goſpel</hi> teacheth us other <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,</hi>
to prevent all occaſions of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
falling from the <hi>True Faith,</hi> and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into <hi>erroneous opinions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To draw to a concluſion, My humble
motion to the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> is, that for a time
they would be pleaſed to forbear the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
any ſo far to re-examination, as upon
refuſal thereof, to prohibit them the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It is hard to ſay whether your
<hi>counſel</hi> ſavoureth more of <hi>carnallitie,</hi> or
<hi>cowardiſe.</hi> Surely <hi>St. Paul</hi> was of a more
<hi>zealous temper,</hi> who <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 5. <hi>gave place
by ſubjection, no not an hour to ſuch</hi> who
would have brought their <hi>Chriſtian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi>
into <hi>bondage.</hi> Such <hi>time-ſerving</hi> as you
commend unto us, what is it but the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating
of the ſcepter of Chriſt to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of man?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> No evil may be done that the
greateſt good may come from it. But
ſome good may be forborn to be done
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114641:25"/>
when, in all <hi>Chriſtian prudence,</hi> thereby a
<hi>greater good</hi> is probable to be promoted.
It had been abſolutely evil in <hi>St. Paul</hi> to
tolerate ſuch <hi>betrayers of the Chriſtian pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges</hi>
a minute or moment, ſo far forth
as in convenient time and place, not to
oppoſe their machinations. But it is <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
wiſdom</hi> for a time to ſuſpend the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of ſuch <hi>practices,</hi> which may be
<hi>lawfull</hi> and <hi>laudable</hi> in themſelves, when
foreſeeing they will neceſſarily attract a
greater danger. This was done even by our
Saviour himſelf, who perceiving the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
carnallitie in his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> reſpited the
delivering of ſome difficult <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and
the preſſing of ſome hard precepts untill
they were arrived at more perfection; <hi>John</hi>
16. 12. <hi>I have yet many things to ſay unto
you, but you cannot bear them now.</hi> Where
the people cannot bear, there the Miniſters
muſt forbear, and patiently wait a fitter
opportunitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Let us of the <hi>Presbyterie</hi> begin
as we will hold. It is given to all autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
to leſſen by the continuance of time:
If we abate ought of our power at firſt,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114641:25"/>
the encroaching of people upon us will

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Objection ſavoureth of the

            <p>I reſume therefore my former motion,
and re-inforce it to the conſideration of
ſuch concerned therein, with the following
motives. Firſt, Men ought not to be buſie
to enjoyn theſe things as neceſſarie duties,
though fitting and convenient, for which
they have no expreſs <hi>commiſsion</hi> in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
What <hi>Proteſtant</hi> will denie the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediencie

became <hi>carnificina,</hi> the <hi>rack and torture of</hi>

but when the ſame was urged with
much violence, what clamours were raiſed
againſt ſuch <hi>practices,</hi> under the norion of

            </p>
            <p>Beſides, <hi>Baptiſm</hi> hath the primitive pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
and the conſtant uſe of the ages.
Whereas the enjoyning of ſuch, who once
have received, to be re-examined, is a <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of yeſterday</hi> in moſt <hi>Proteſtant Churches.</hi>
Herein I appeal to the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch
Congregations</hi> in <hi>London</hi> (branches con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to their <hi>reſpective roots</hi> in <hi>forreign
parts</hi>) whether ſtrangers coming unto them
with a <hi>Teſtimonial,</hi> that once they have
been admitted, are not received for <hi>Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
without any further inquirie or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p>Indeed, if every particular Member, and
ſo by conſequence every <hi>Pariſh</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
ſhould be ſubject to a new examination on
every removeal of an <hi>old,</hi> and election of
a new <hi>Miniſter,</hi> ſome <hi>Pariſhes</hi> would never
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114641:27"/>
be out of examination. What ſaith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
Prov. 28. 2. <hi>For the tranſgreſsions of
a land, many are the Princes thereof.</hi> Not
meaning <hi>all abreaſt</hi> at once (which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
is both true in it ſelf, and a
trouble to the people) but many ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
ſinfull people make <hi>ſhort-liv'd</hi> Princes.
Many, not in <hi>ranck</hi> but in <hi>file,</hi> one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
I will not ſay the <hi>bad Pariſhioners</hi>
make many <hi>Paſtours</hi> in the place, but be
the reproof parted betwixt both (that ſo
it may fall the lighter and be the better
born.) What betwixt the faults of the one
and the other, many have been the <hi>Avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances</hi>
of <hi>Incumbents,</hi> and ſubſtituting of
new ones in their room in a ſhort time, ſo
that if communicants were of neceſſitie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examinable
on every alteration, ſome Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
would be in a perpetual <hi>Probaſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erſhip,</hi>
and conſtant <hi>Candidate-ſhip</hi> for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</p>
            <p>Not to ſay but that in ſome <hi>Pariſhes</hi>
(large in extent and numerous in people)
were <hi>monthly communions</hi> obſerved (which
formerly was the commendable practice,
and ſtill is the juſt deſire of many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters)
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114641:27"/>
it would be the conſtant work of the
Miniſter, to do nothing elſe but examin
his people, the which would engroſs &amp; take
up his whole time. And then, if all his care
be examining, where is his praying, his
preaching, his ſtudying, his viſiting the
ſick, and his other performances?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Excluding the Communion
for refuſing re-examination, is a ſeveritie
unreaſonable at this time. We read of King
<hi>Amaziah,</hi> 2. Chron. 25. 3. <hi>Now it came
to paſs, when the kingdom was eſtabliſhed to
him, that he ſlew his ſervants that had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the King his Father.</hi> Why did <hi>Amazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
ſo long connive at <hi>murther</hi> the worſt of
ſins? <hi>Treaſon</hi> the worſt of <hi>Murders,</hi> and
<hi>Treaſon</hi> againſt his <hi>own Father,</hi> the worſt of
<hi>Treaſons,</hi> as to ſuffer the <hi>Actors</hi> thereof ſo
long to enjoy their lives? A ſatisfactorie
reaſon is rendered; he was not as yet faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
on his <hi>Throne.</hi> To ſtrike fiercely with
ones hands before he ſtandeth firmly on
his feet, is the readie way for one to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
himſelf. People muſt, till they are
well ſettled themſelves, and well rooted &amp;
riveted in their power, be cautious of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114641:28"/>
any, and may juſtly ſuſpend the
puniſhing of what is faultie till a fitter
oportunitie.</p>
            <p>And now to commend unto you a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<hi>expedient,</hi> which may in ſome ſort mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate
the rigor of proceedings. Firſt know
it is one thing <hi>Magiſterially</hi> and <hi>Imperiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
to thruſt people from the <hi>ſacrament,</hi> and
another thing to requeſt and intreat them
as they tender their own good, to abſtain
from the receiving thereof. Both meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in the ſame end, effect the ſame
thing, though embracing ſeveral ways in
order thereunto. The firſt way being
rough, rugged, full of displeaſure and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſte;
the ſecond ſoft, ſmooth, more eaſie
both for <hi>Paſtor</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to the meekneſs of the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi>
in the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Let this later way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be uſed by you, when you ſee juſt
cauſe to ſeclude a <hi>Pariſhioner</hi> from recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of the <hi>ſacrament</hi> for ſuſpected or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
inſufficiencie, when <hi>ingenuitie</hi> and
hope of amendment is legible in him. As</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Titus Veſpaſian</hi> (for the
ſweetneſs of his nature, ſtiled the <hi>delight of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114641:28"/>
mankind</hi>) the <hi>neminem demiſit triſtem,</hi> he
never ſent any <hi>ſuitors</hi> ſad away from him.
Yet it muſt certainly be preſumed, that he
denied many their deſires, it being uſual at
<hi>Court,</hi> that there be ſeveral <hi>Petitioners</hi> for
the ſame <hi>Office,</hi> which onely one can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
but then that <hi>Emperour</hi> had the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
ſo to qualifie his denials with good
language, that he made them but one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
from a <hi>grant.</hi> Sometimes he would
convince ſuch Suitors in their judgements,
that they requeſted that which was not in
his preſent power to grant. Sometimes he
ſhewed them, that their deſires were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
unto themſelves, at leaſtwiſe, that
they were unfit and improper to receive
them. Sometimes he would promiſe them
the next preferment far better and fitter
for them. In a word, without any falſhood
or flatterie (as beneath the <hi>Majeſtie</hi> of a
<hi>Prince</hi>) his ſoft, ſupple, and complying
nature ſo applied it ſelf to all dispoſitions,
that people contentedly, yea, thankfully &amp;
chearfully departed from him with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials.</p>
            <p>God hath given you ſuch <hi>ſinews</hi> of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:114641:29"/>
and ſuch <hi>colours</hi> of <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> &amp; ſuch
perſwaſive tongues, if pleaſed to improve
them, that except you meet with <hi>unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

            <p>
               <hi>Neighbour, with</hi> Joſeph, <hi>I would be a

I am jealous over you with a godlie jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie,

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114641:29"/>

my power, if ſo diſpoſed, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
you forbearance, but what ſaith <hi>St.
Paul,</hi> Philemon 8. Wherefore though I
might be ſo much bold in Chriſt to enjoyn
thee, the which is convenient, yet for loves

this counſel, and no other by-reſpect.</p>

that an ingenious nature will be affected
therewith, and cannot take juſt exception
thereat.</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>expedient</hi> I recommend is
this, even to practice our <hi>Saviour</hi> his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 17. <hi>Neither do men put new

the wine runneth out, and the bottles periſh:
but they put new wine into new bottles, and

            </p>
            <p>I apply it thus, put <hi>old wine into old bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi>
your <hi>ancient Communicants</hi> which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114641:30"/>
have frequently received of your

to the ancient cuſtom of receiving, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them without any ſcruple (except ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludible
according to the premiſes, for
ſome notorious ſin) charitably preſuming
(nothing appearing to the contrary) that
they are improved in ſufficiencie for the

            <p>Now <hi>put new wine into new bottles.</hi> Such
<hi>novices,</hi> which never before received, and
remember not the <hi>old Temple.</hi> I mean
the former <hi>diſcipline</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> under
<hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi> whoſe maturitie to receive
bears date onely from the beginning of our
differences. Let them on Gods bleſſing be
ſolemnly tried and examined before they
be admitted unto the receiving of the <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here by your leave and favour, I
humbly conceive, that the<note n="*" place="margin">Anno Dom 1645. die lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae Oct. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Ordinance</hi> of
<hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> (if ſeriouſly peruſed
according to the genuine and natural ſence
of the words, ſpeaks onely <hi>de admittendis,</hi>
and not <hi>de admiſsis,</hi> and impowereth <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>
onely to the Examination of ſuch
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114641:30"/>
who received it not before, who ought
now more ſtrictly to be examined in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
than ever before: for the <hi>Church of
Rome</hi> erroneouſly advanced Confirmation
to ſuch a height, as to make it a <hi>ſacrament.</hi>
The <hi>Church of England</hi> under Epiſcopacie
retained it ſo far as an ancient and uſefull
cuſtom, appropriating the exerciſe thereof
to <hi>Biſhops</hi> alone. The <hi>preſent diſcipline</hi> hath
utterly aboliſhed both <hi>Biſhop</hi> and the uſe
of Confirmation. However, ſomething
analogical thereunto may and muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.
The Primitive Chriſtians being
wiſe in the appointing, though after-ages
were ſuperſtitious in the abuſing thereof,
and the more <hi>confirmation</hi> is neglected, the
more ought a ſerious examination of youth
in this kind be continued and practiſed.</p>
            <p>In a word, there is a way to examin
people, committed to the care of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters,</hi>
which may be done without any
dangerous noyſe, and without the leaſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition
of pragmaticalneſs, and yet to the
great glorie of God, quiet of the Miniſter,
and edification of the Church. This exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
conſiſteth not in ſummoning peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114641:31"/>
before them, and ſounding them with
Queſtion and Anſwer, but in the ſolid and
faithfull preaching the ſincere Word of
God, which carrieth a <hi>ſecret ſearching power</hi>
along therein, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>For the word of
God is quick, and powerfull, and ſharper than
any two-edged ſword, piercing even to the
dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of
the joynts and marrow, and is a diſcerner of
the thoughts, and intents of the heart.</hi> Thus
by <hi>prophecying</hi> (that is by preaching of
Gods Word) 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>If there come
in one that believeth not, or one unlearned,
he is convinced of all, he is judged of all: &amp;
thus are the ſecrets of his heart made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
and ſo falling down on his face, he will
worſhip God, and report that God is in you of
a truth.</hi> I ſay, let us take off for a time
from the other, and more practice this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
as leaſt ſubject to exception.
Trie it but for a time, and you ſhall ſee
what ſucceſs it will find, and fright unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
perſons from the Sacrament, with a
more awfull reverence than your actual ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
them for not ſubmitting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to re-examination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:114641:31"/>
To conclude, I may compare the firſt
high acting of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> to men running
in a race. It is impoſſible for a <hi>Racer</hi> to
ſtop juſt at the <hi>mark:</hi> he muſt either over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run
it, or elſe can never come at it. But
when paſt the <hi>mark,</hi> (neceſſarily transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his own fierceneſs beyond the
ſame) he will return to it again, to ſhew
that that place and no further was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
end of his endeavours.</p>
            <p>Whileſt you conteſted with <hi>Epiſcopacie,</hi>
your <hi>Corrival,</hi> and were ſeven years ſince
in the height and heat of your contention,
therewith much may be pleaded for your
<hi>paſsion,</hi> if it transported you in ſome acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
beyond the juſt <hi>ſtandard</hi> and <hi>proportion</hi>
of your judgements.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing now it hath pleaſed God that
you have run your Adverſarie quite out of
diſtance, and have attained that you ſtrove
for, it will be no ſhame, nay it will be your
honor to abate and remit of your former
eagerneſs, and coolly and calmly to return
to the place which you over-ſhot in the
Paroxciſm of that conteſt. This is the
humble adviſe and deſire of him who hath
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114641:32"/>
no private ends therein; but the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Gods glorie, and the good of his
Church. Amen.</p>

            <p>THis Chapter preſents us with four
principal remarkables.</p>
            <p>The ſolemn ſeparation of <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Barnabas</hi> for the <hi>Ministerie,</hi> five pious
perſons are mentioned, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. all in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
likelihood, equally probable for the
employment. <hi>Barnabas, Simeon, Lucius,
Mahanaem,</hi> and <hi>Saul;</hi> of theſe God leaves
the three middlemoſt, takes the firſt and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114641:33"/>
the laſt; <hi>even ſo Father becauſe it pleaſeth
thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then have we the three firſt adventures
of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> in there <hi>Miniſterie,</hi>
whereof the firſt proved proſperous, the
ſecond with the <hi>Jews</hi> at <hi>Antioch</hi> had ſad
ſucceſs, the third with the <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the
ſame place came off with comfort. We <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi>
muſt not be elated with good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
but fear the worſt, nor dejected with
bad, but hope the better.</p>
            <p>In their firſt adventure they confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Elimas</hi> the <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> converted

his next voyage ends ſadly, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully
with <hi>Blaſphemie</hi> and <hi>Perſecution</hi>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114641:33"/>
in my Text; <hi>and after the reading
of the Law and the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The words contain a principal part of
the <hi>Jewiſh Liturgie,</hi> or if that displeaſe,
their <hi>Directorie,</hi> wherein their ſolemn <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-ſervice</hi>
is plainly preſented unto us. I
confeſs, there is no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of prayer an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
part of Gods worſhip among them,
(my houſe ſhall be called the houſe of
prayer) which is omitted in the <hi>Text,</hi> not

<hi>St. Luke</hi> haſteneth with all conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
ſpeed to the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> part, as leading
the neareſt way to the matter in hand.
Some perſons account this verſe their <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-piece,</hi>
hoping hence by their cunning
<hi>Chymiſtrie,</hi> to extract a <hi>Licence general</hi> for
all men to preach; though the words well
underſtood, are ſo far from their building
any advantage thereon, that they batter
down both their <hi>opinions</hi> and <hi>practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We will firſt clear the ſame from the
incumbrances of all difficulties, and then
extract natural and profitable obſervations
from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Law and the Prophets</hi>] Law taken large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114641:34"/>
conteineth all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> &amp; <hi>Prophets</hi>
taken largely, compriſe all the <hi>Law,</hi> 2. Pet.
1. 20. <hi>No Propheſie of Scripture is of private
interpretation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea <hi>Moſes,</hi> the <hi>Prophet Paramount</hi> was
the <hi>penner</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> Deut. 34. 10. And
there <hi>aroſe not a Prophet ſince in Iſrael like
unto Moſes whom the Lord knew face to face.</hi>
But when the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed,
ſo as to devide the <hi>old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
betwixt them, as <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 20. <hi>they
have Moſes and the Prophets:</hi> then by <hi>Law</hi>
is meant the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> or <hi>five books of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
by <hi>Prophets</hi> all the reſt of the <hi>old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
not onely ſuch parts as foretel what
was to come, but alſo which <hi>hiſtorically</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
what was paſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rabbins</hi> tell us, that the <hi>five books
of Moſes</hi> were divided into fiftie three <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſoth</hi>
or <hi>Diviſions</hi> (each whereof contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one hundred thirtie ſix verſes) and one
of them was read every Sabbath-day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
at the firſt <hi>Sabbath</hi> after the feaſt
of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> if any ſay, there being but
fiftie two <hi>Sabbaths</hi> in the year, what did
they with the odd <hi>Peraſoth,</hi> or <hi>Diviſion?</hi> I
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114641:34"/>
can give no certain account, ſave that it is
probable they doubled their <hi>office</hi> the laſt
<hi>Sabbath,</hi> hemming it, as I may ſay, at the
cloſe and concluſion thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Masters of the Synagogue.</hi>] why plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral?
what ſaith <hi>St. James, be not many Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
Anſw.</hi> By <hi>Maſters</hi> are meant the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Rulers</hi> thereof, which as the <hi>Rabbins</hi>
do teach, were ſubordinate one to another.</p>
            <p>Here it will be worth our pains to make
enquirie into the <hi>name, firſt founding,</hi> and
uſe of the <hi>Synagogues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Synagogue, ſignifieth a Meeting-place
where many are aſſembled together. The
firſt and laſt mention of them in the <hi>old
Teſtament,</hi> is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 8. <hi>they have burnt up
all the ſynagogues of God in the land.</hi> Now
if this Pſalm had had any large Title, we
might have conjectured at the time when
<hi>ſynagogues</hi> were firſt founded. But nothing
appears in the front thereof more than, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchil</hi>
to <hi>Aſaph.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, if this <hi>Aſaph</hi> was the ſame with
him who was contemporarie with <hi>David,</hi>
1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 2. whoſe ſons were deſigned
for <hi>ſolemn ſingers,</hi> this would advance the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114641:35"/>
ſenioritie of <hi>ſynagogues</hi> as extant in <hi>Davids</hi>
time: But much weight muſt not be laid
on ſo ſlender a proof for fear of failing.
Seeing <hi>Aſaph</hi> there may be taken, not for
his perſon, but for his poſteritie, ſome
hundred years after; the reſult of all is this,
uncertain but ancient is the <hi>Original</hi> of <hi>ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues,</hi>
as before the <hi>Captivitie of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>
No poſitive place of <hi>Scripture</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enjoyneth their <hi>foundation,</hi> onely for
the neceſſarie eaſe of <hi>People</hi> who could not
repair to the <hi>Temple</hi> and return back to
their own homes on a <hi>Sabbath-day.</hi> Theſe
may be ſaid to be <hi>jure Divino ſecundario,</hi>
by <hi>Divine right</hi> once removed, namely
collected from the Scriptures by neceſſarie
conſequence, and were conſtantly graced
with our Saviours companie therein. Theſe
<hi>ſynagogues</hi> ſerved for a double intent, as our
<hi>Churches</hi> for <hi>Devotion,</hi> and as <hi>Schools</hi> or
<hi>Academies</hi> for <hi>Diſputation.</hi> Act. 17. 17.
<hi>Therefore diſputed he in the ſynagogues with
the Jews.</hi> So that the <hi>ſynagogue</hi> may be
preſented in its <hi>lively Pourtracture,</hi> like to
the <hi>Builders of the walls of Jeruſalem,</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.
4. 17. <hi>holding a Trowel, to build it, in</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:114641:35"/>
               <hi>one hand, and a Weapon, to defend it, in the
other.</hi> Semblablie the <hi>ſynagogues</hi> were both
for <hi>edification</hi> of <hi>people</hi> in <hi>knowledge,</hi> and
for <hi>controverſial defending</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi>
therein by <hi>Polemical Learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sent unto them, ſaying,</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It ſeems it was faſhionable in
that age, that any who would might preach
in the <hi>ſynagogues,</hi> onely with a courteous
call of the <hi>Maſters</hi> thereof; ſo that the <hi>Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit</hi>
lay open to all <hi>comers</hi> and <hi>goers,</hi> &amp; not
(as ſome now endeavour) encloſed by, yea
engroſed a <hi>particular profeſsion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In anſwer hereunto we will firſt clear the
Title which both <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> had
to preach the Word.</p>
            <p>Firſt for <hi>Barnabas,</hi> his firſt title was, by
his <hi>extraction,</hi> being a <hi>Levite,</hi> Act. 14. 36.
to whom it belonged by their Profeſſion to
teach the <hi>people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, he had an <hi>extraordinarie call</hi>
from God in the ſecond verſe of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter:
beſides, at this time a <hi>civil invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
from the <hi>Maſters</hi> of the <hi>ſynagogue.</hi> Thus
his three-fold cable cannot be broken, nor
any unlawfull invading of the <hi>Miniſterial
office</hi> be charged upon him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:114641:36"/>
Thirdly, St. <hi>Pauls Commiſsion</hi> to preach,
doth appear both by his <hi>abilitie</hi> and <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie</hi>
for the ſame. His <hi>abilitie,</hi> Act. 22.
3. <hi>Brought up at the feet of Gamaliel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> We confeſs his <hi>abilitie,</hi> but denie
his <hi>authoritie;</hi> for firſt he was no <hi>Levite,</hi>
but of the <hi>Tribe of Benjamin,</hi> to whom the
expounding of the <hi>Law</hi> was never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
Secondly, he was one of a <hi>manual</hi>
and <hi>Mechanical trade,</hi> Act. 18. 3. <hi>A Tent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All is confeſt, but let the <hi>unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Reader</hi> conſider firſt, that <hi>Paul</hi> was a
<hi>Phariſee,</hi> the ſon of a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> Act. 23. 6.
Seaſonably let him alſo weigh the words
of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Matth. 23. 2, 3. <hi>The ſcribes
and Phariſees ſit in Moſes chair: all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whatſoever they bid you obſerve, that
obſerve and do: but do not after their works,
for they ſay and do not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, the <hi>Lay-phariſees,</hi> as I may term
them, ſit not in <hi>Moſes chair</hi> in one capacity,
becauſe being of other <hi>Tribes,</hi> they might
not <hi>offer ſacrifice, officiate at the Altar, and
attend at the Temple,</hi> but onely as <hi>Profeſſors</hi>
of the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Doctors,</hi> they might read
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114641:36"/>
publick Lectures to their Auditors.
Thirdly, let them conſider that Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
as aforeſaid, were of double uſe,
and ſerved for an Academie as well as a
Congregation. All which laid together, it
will plainly appear, that <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical
capacitie,</hi> had ſufficient authoritie to
teach in the <hi>ſynagogue.</hi> Not to ſpeak of his
<hi>calling</hi> of <hi>Callings,</hi> his extraordinarie and
immediate Commiſſion from God, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing
him to the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Grant the <hi>abilitie</hi> and <hi>autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi>
of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to preach, yet
both were utterly unknown to the <hi>Maſters</hi>
of the <hi>Jewiſh ſynagogue</hi> in <hi>Antioch,</hi> who
beheld them as neither more nor leſs than
meer ſtrangers, caſually coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt we will premiſe the anſwer
of <hi>Carthuſianus a learned Papist,</hi> and juſtly
diſſent from the former part thereof. <hi>Ex
habitu cenſuerunt eſſe pios</hi> &amp; <hi>Religioſos.</hi> They
eſteemed them, ſaith he, to be pious and
religious men by their habit.</p>
            <p>To this I agree negatively thus far, that
nothing of vanitie or lightneſs appeared in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114641:37"/>
there clothes to ſpeak them idle or fooliſh
perſons, but otherwiſe I diſſent, that the
form or faſhion of their clothes differed
from other <hi>people.</hi> Surely what would hide
and heat, cover and keep warm, ſerved
their turns. The Cloak, no doubt, which
<hi>Paul</hi> left at <hi>Troas,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13. differed
not in ſhape from other mens. For then in
the time of perſecution to be diſtinguiſhed
by their habit from others, what was it but
to give a mark of discoverie to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
malice, yea, to give them aim to level
the more ſteadily at them. And yet I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
not, but that it is fitting, that in times of
Peace <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſhould be diſtinguiſhed
from ordinarie men by the gravitie of their
garments. And the <hi>Ancient Church-Canons</hi>
on that kind, were grounded on juſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
            <p>We anſwer, It is more than probable,
that the fame of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> came
to <hi>Antioch</hi> before their perſons came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
There being dayly intercourſe by Sea
betwixt <hi>Paphos,</hi> a <hi>famous Port</hi> in <hi>Cyprus,</hi>
and this <hi>Antioch.</hi> The ſmiting <hi>Elimas the
Sorcerer</hi> blind, and converting of <hi>Sergius
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114641:37"/>
Paulus,</hi> could not but make a ſtrange and
ſudden impreſſion on the neighbouring
places.</p>
            <p>Secondly, their grave demeanour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
behaviour in the Synagogues atta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
the eyes of all people to behold them
and beholding, to read in them more than
common and ordinarie perſons. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved
not themſelves in <hi>Gods houſe</hi> during
the exerciſe of Gods ordinance, like ſome
<hi>ſpiritual Clowns</hi> now adays, whoſe unreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
deportment bewrays their ignorance;
but ſo decently they demeaned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
that they ſtruck the <hi>beholders</hi> into a
reverent opinion of their perſons, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
at their profeſſions to be <hi>Preachers
of Gods Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, had the <hi>Maſters</hi> of the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue</hi>
been miſtaken herein, had <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas</hi> been otherwiſe than they appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and were apprehended to be [<hi>viz.</hi> no
more than common men unimpowered
with a <hi>Commiſsion</hi>] to preach. Surely the
<hi>Rulers</hi> preſumed on their <hi>modestie</hi> and <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie,</hi>
that they would decline the proffer,
ſeeing in that Age, none adventured to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114641:38"/>
teach without lawfull authoritie, as largely,
God willing, ſhall be proved hereafter.
Mean time let us proceed to the Collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſome natural obſervations from the
words, <hi>After the reading of the Law and the
Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 1. <hi>It is good reaſon, that Gods word
in the Church ſhould have precedency of mens
meditations.</hi> For Gods word is all gold,
(and prized above it by <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 19.
10.) the beſt mens meditations but ſilver
and guilt, and that ſilver having much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
therein, which debaſeth the metal,
though it maketh it to work the better to
mens underſtandings, rendering the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
puritie of Gods word more eaſie and
intelligible when expounded, explained,
and applied by the pains and endeavours
of <hi>Miniſters.</hi> Wherefore as the <hi>Maſter of
the Feaſt,</hi> John 2. would have the beſt wine
brought firſt, and then what was worſe. So
fit it is that the <hi>virgin attentions</hi> of the
people in the Church, ſhould firſt be fed
with the pure and ſincere word of God, as
it is in the Text, and afterwards their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
may be entertained with leſs daintie
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114641:38"/>
diet, the ſermons and ſtudies of their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 2. <hi>It was an ancient cuſtome in the
Church, that Gods word was publickly read
therein.</hi> And here let us endeavour to
raiſe the juſt reputation of the word pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
read; ſome conceive, that the <hi>Word
preached,</hi> is as much holyer than the <hi>Word
read,</hi> as the <hi>Pulpit</hi> is higher than the <hi>Desk.</hi>
Yea ſuch will ſay, <hi>my ſelf,</hi> or <hi>ſon,</hi> or <hi>ſervant</hi>
can read a Chapter as well at home, as any
the moſt <hi>accompliſhed Miniſter</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
But let ſuch know, that he which doth not
honor all, doth not honor any of <hi>Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,</hi>
&amp; it is juſt with God, that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Word ſhould prove uneffectual
to ſuch as ſlight and neglect the reading
thereof.</p>
            <p>Doct. 3. <hi>Bleſſed be the goodneſs of God,
who hath bettered the Bill of fare of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
by allowing our ſouls a ſecond Courſe of
the New Teſtament.</hi> And properly may the
<hi>New Teſtament</hi> be termed a <hi>ſecond courſe,</hi>
which commonly hath diſhes fewer than
the firſt, for there quantitie, finer for the
qualitie of the meat; and here far be it from
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114641:39"/>
me to make compariſons (which are odious
in themſelves, and ſo much the more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
the more eminent the perſons or
things are that be compared) betwixt the
<hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> in holy
zeal, by claſhing the firſt Table againſt the
ſecond, brake both: ſo ſome prophanely
&amp; deſpightfully abuſe <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
about preeminence betwixt them.
But acknowledging them both beſt in this
reſpect, as to us, the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> excels
as far as a bleſſing performed is better
than a bleſſing promiſed, and a <hi>Saviour</hi>
tendered in poſſeſſion, more comfort than
in reverſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Rulers of the Synagogue.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> 4. <hi>No conſiderable ſocietie can long
comfortably ſubſiſt without ſome government
to order the ſame.</hi> Ten are but a few men,
yet <hi>Moſes,</hi> by the <hi>Counſel</hi> of <hi>wiſe Jethro</hi> his
<hi>Father in Law,</hi> Exod. 18. 25. <hi>made Rulers
of tens.</hi> Better is a <hi>Tyranny</hi> than an <hi>Anarchie:</hi>
for where every man doth what is good in
his own eyes, where there is equalitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all, there will be equitie but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
few men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:114641:39"/>
Doct. 5. <hi>It is lawfull for Miniſters to
make uſe of the help of others, not onely in
their ſickneſs and neceſſarie abſence, but alſo
when their own perſons are preſent.</hi> Firſt,
becauſe we muſt as well <hi>mend our nets,</hi> as
always <hi>catch fiſhes;</hi> as well ſtudie for new
ſupply, as always <hi>preach.</hi> And ſeeing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath given us as well two ears as a
tongue, we muſt as attentively liſten to the
parts and pains of others, as contentedly
utter our own <hi>meditations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, ſuch varietie will not onely be
pleaſant but profitable to our <hi>people In the
mouth of two or three witneſſes let every truth
be eſtabliſhed.</hi> When the People ſhall hear
the ſame matter in a different manner, one
truth [<hi>Salvation by Gods mercies alone and
Chriſts merits</hi>] dreſſed in ſeveral motives
and methods, and expreſſions. <hi>The nails
will be driven the faster by many Maſters of
the Aſſembly;</hi> and though it be faultie for
itching ears to heap up <hi>Teachers</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
yet ſometimes ſuch <hi>exchange of
Preachers,</hi> increaſe the <hi>edification of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 6. <hi>They may have courteſie and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilitie</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:114641:40"/>
               <hi>in them, who notwithſtanding may be
devoid of grace and true ſinceritie.</hi> Theſe
<hi>Maſters of the Synagogue</hi> began very man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly,
proffer <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie
of the place, but all ended at laſt in
<hi>blaſphemie</hi> and <hi>perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doct. 7. <hi>None are to preach but ſuch who
are lawfully called thereunto.</hi> The <hi>Rulers</hi> of
the <hi>Synagogue</hi> gave a licence to <hi>Paul</hi> and
<hi>Barnabas,</hi> who intrude not without their
leave and deſire. How many now a days
in deſpight of the <hi>Rulers</hi> of the <hi>Synagogues,</hi>
the undoubted <hi>Patron,</hi> the <hi>lawfull Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent,</hi>
the <hi>Guardians</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
choſen, ſtorm the <hi>Pulpit</hi> by their meer
violence, without any other <hi>Call</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion</hi>
thereunto.</p>
            <p>Be it firſt premiſed, that we proteſt our
<hi>Integritie</hi> not to invade the due <hi>Right</hi> of
any <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> with <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 14. 23.
<hi>We will not take a ſhoo-latchet which is none
of our own.</hi> To which purpoſe we lay down
the following Rules, allowing as much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
as may be to all <hi>Gods ſervants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Parents</hi> &amp; <hi>Maſters</hi> of <hi>Families,</hi> may
and muſt privately teach their own <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:114641:40"/>
and <hi>Servants.</hi> Teach them, and thou
ſhalt be taught; Inſtruct them, and God
will inſtruct thee; never had <hi>Abram,</hi> in all
probabilitie, ſo ſoon known Gods intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to deſtroy <hi>Sodom;</hi> but becauſe <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.
19. <hi>he would command his children to keep
the Law of God.</hi> Even <hi>Mothers</hi> ought to do
this, who have a legiſlative power over
their <hi>Sons,</hi> Prov. 1. 8. <hi>Forſake not the law
of thy Mother.</hi> It is remarkable, that great
grace which God did to a <hi>Mother,</hi> that her
private precepts, (namely <hi>Bathſheba</hi> to her
<hi>Son Lemuel</hi>) Prov. 31. were afterward
made <hi>Canonical Scripture</hi> for Gods whole
<hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet let me adviſe <hi>Parents,</hi> when modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
undertaking in their own houſes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
Scripture, not to make <hi>fountain,</hi> but
<hi>Ciſtern expoſitions</hi> thereof. <hi>viz.</hi> not to be
the <hi>inventers,</hi> but the <hi>declarers;</hi> not the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſers,</hi>
but the <hi>remembrancers</hi> of <hi>inter preta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Children and ſervants, I have heard
ſuch a godly Preacher, or have read in ſuch
a learned comment thus to expound this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of Scripture.</hi> But if he ſhould adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of himſelf to tender unto them an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:114641:41"/>
let it be done with an humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
and ſubmiſſion to the better
judgements of thoſe, whoſe proper profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
it is to expound the ſame. Hoever, he
may more ſafely deal in <hi>Application</hi> than
in <hi>Explication</hi> of <hi>Gods word,</hi> the general
<hi>precepts, promiſes,</hi> and <hi>threatenings,</hi> whereof,
he may effectually applly to himſelf and
thoſe of his <hi>familie</hi> under his inſpection.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Judges</hi> on the <hi>Bench</hi> may and
muſt in their charges teach the Countie
there aſſembled, inſerting Scripture in their
diſcourſes, ſuch the correſpondencie, and
mutual good intelligence between the
Laws of God and Man, that they return
and receive ſtrength and luſtre each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
This made <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> to couple
Judges and Prieſts together in the viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his people, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. verſ. 7. <hi>alſo
in the third of his reigne he ſent to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
even to Benhail, and to Obadiah.</hi> verſ. 8.
<hi>And with them he ſent Levites, even She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiah,</hi>
&amp;c. verſ. 9. <hi>And they taught in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
&amp;c. The one the Law of the Land, the
other the Law of the Lord; which excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Medley made a cordial compoſition
thus put together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:114641:41"/>
Thirdly, <hi>Profeſſors</hi> in the <hi>Univerſitie,</hi> as
the <hi>Doctors of the Chair,</hi> may, in a <hi>contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſial
way,</hi> preach to young <hi>Students</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them. Such <hi>Doctors in Divinitie</hi> are
generally in <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> but if (which is
rare) one unordained be preferred to the
place, he may uſe <hi>Polemical preaching,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
himſelf to the <hi>Schools,</hi> the proper
centre thereof.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Generals</hi> in the <hi>Field,</hi> before
and after the <hi>fight,</hi> may make <hi>Orations</hi> or
Sermons if you pleaſe, to encourage the
<hi>ſouldiers.</hi> I confeſs, as cuſtom hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
the word <hi>Bible,</hi> (ſignifying in it ſelf
any Book) to the Word of God, ſo hath
it appropriated <hi>ſermons</hi> (which importeth
any ſpeech) to thoſe made by a <hi>Preacher</hi>
in the <hi>Pulpit:</hi> Otherwiſe thoſe may paſs
for <hi>ſermons</hi> which <hi>Generals</hi> utter in the <hi>field</hi>
as <hi>Joab, Abiah, Jehoſaphat.</hi> And becauſe
all true valour is founded in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God in <hi>Christ,</hi> ſuch <hi>Generals</hi> may
and muſt, to raiſe the reſolution of their
ſouldiers: by inſerting and interpoſing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
of Scripture, animating them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on God the juſt maintainer of a right
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114641:42"/>
cauſe. Thus Queen <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> in 88. at <hi>Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
Camp,</hi> inſpirited her ſouldiers with her
Chriſtian exhortation.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, all Chriſtians ought mutually
to teach and inſtruct one another. In this
caſe every <hi>place</hi> is a <hi>Church, day</hi> a <hi>Sabbath,
occaſion</hi> a <hi>Text, perſon</hi> a <hi>Preacher.</hi> Rom. 15.
14. <hi>Admoniſh one another,</hi> Col. 3. 16. <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
one another in Pſalms and Hymns,</hi>
Theſſ. 4. 18. <hi>Comfort one another with theſe
words,</hi> Jude 11. <hi>Edifie one another even as
alſo ye do,</hi> Heb. 3. 13. <hi>Exhorting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
To this end are <hi>talents</hi> beſtowed on
men that they ſhould ſtirr up the <hi>gifts of
grace</hi> which are in them. Thus <hi>Priſcilla,</hi>
though a woman, inſtructed <hi>Apollos.</hi> But
here we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>mutuall</hi>
and <hi>Miniſterial teaching.</hi> In the former
the <hi>Romans</hi> may be ſaid to teach <hi>St. Paul,</hi>
as well as <hi>St. Paul</hi> the <hi>Romans. I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
with you by the mutual faith both of
you and me,</hi> Rom. 1. 12. whilſt <hi>Miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
teaching</hi> belongeth onely to ſuch, who
are ſolemnely called thereunto.</p>
            <p>Take two <hi>Criteria</hi> or diſtinguiſhing
marks, betwixt <hi>mutual</hi> and <hi>Miniſterial</hi>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:114641:42"/>
teaching. The former is compatible with
another <hi>vocation,</hi> either <hi>liberal</hi> or <hi>mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
according to the condition of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
Yea which is more, not onely it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to have another calling, but in ſome
caſes for ſome men, ſinfull to be without it;
S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 10. If any would
not work, neither ſhould he eate. This
<hi>mutual teaching</hi> of others will not excuſe
peoples idleneſs, nor can they plead for
themſelves, this <hi>mutual labour in love</hi> ſhall
exempt them from other <hi>manual work;</hi>
becauſe by it ſelf it amounts not to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
profeſſion, as being the entire body
of a calling, which is onely a part and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
member of all mens duty, as they
are <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> But <hi>publick preaching</hi> is to
poſſeſs the whole man as the higheſt of
employments, wherein he may uſe all his
pains and endeavours.</p>
            <p>Secondly, no <hi>Salary</hi> or <hi>reward</hi> is due to
<hi>mutual teaching</hi> (ſave the inward bleſſing
which God bountifully will beſtow on
ſuch as labour therein) ſo that the <hi>Teacher</hi>
may demand it of due, it being an injury
in the party taught to detain the ſame.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114641:43"/>
Such <hi>Teachers</hi> muſt know themſelves ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
ſatisfied by the good, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
unto them by reflection, having
their graces heightned and intended by
their inſtruction: Beſides the party taught
reſtoreth oft times inſtruction unto him;
and ſo there is nothing due in the recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of courteſies, but the obligation
cancelled on both ſide. But <hi>to miniſterial
preaching</hi> wages is due by Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>The labourer is worthy of his hire,</hi>
becauſe ſequeſtring his ſoul from other
works to attend that buſineſs alone, God
hath ordered it, 1 Cor. <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 14. <hi>that thoſe
that preach the Goſpel ſhall live of the
Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have we given, or rather God hath
given, and we have declared, how Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
un-ordained may teach Gods word
in a <hi>Domeſtical,</hi> in a <hi>mutual,</hi> in a <hi>military,</hi>
in a <hi>Judicial,</hi> in an <hi>Academical</hi> capacity,
ſhame light on that <hi>ſteward</hi> who is nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly
where his <hi>maſter</hi> commands him
to be bountifull, had we denyed <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
this liberty, we had wronged them
much, our ſelves more, God moſt. But
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114641:43"/>
now let me ſay unto them in the words of
the <hi>maſter of the Houſhould,</hi> Matth. 20 the
14. <hi>Tolle quod tuum eſt, &amp; abi, Take what
is thine and go thy way.</hi> Be contented with
what hath been allotted unto you, which
hath been fairly meaſured out and with
all poſſible advantage. Gripe and graſpe
not after more, leaſt you looſe the bleſſing
and benefit of what you have, which hath
now brought us to the following Doctrine
as chiefly intended in this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Come we now to the main Doctrine
which is this, <hi>none may ordinarily execute
the office of Preacher, except lawfully call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereunto, I ſay ordinarily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For much may and muſt be indulged to
<hi>Lay-men</hi> in <hi>abſolute neceſsity,</hi> if they adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to exerciſe the <hi>miniſterial function.</hi> I
ſay <hi>abſolute neceſſity;</hi> Here firſt I exclude
all <hi>conditional neceſsity</hi> which is but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of conveniency. Such <hi>Saul</hi> might
have pleaded for himſelf, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 9.
<hi>When preſuming to ſacrifice to prevent the
peoples ſcattering.</hi> But when the neceſſity
is invincible and unavoydable, God may
ſeem to diſpenſe as in <hi>Davids</hi> eating the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114641:44"/>
               <hi>ſhew-bread</hi> properly belonging to <hi>Priests</hi>
alone. Otherwiſe men muſt not firſt make
<hi>neceſsities,</hi> and then make uſe of thoſe <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsities</hi>
to excuſe their <hi>extraordinary
practices.</hi> For inſtance, ſuppoſe ſome out
of fullenneſs and pride, conceiving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
too good to converſe with <hi>conmmon
Chriſtians,</hi> ſhould ſeparate themſelves (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

place from all <hi>ſociety.</hi> It were preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for one of them to adventure on the
<hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>ministery.</hi> But put caſe ſome
number of people (none of them ever or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained

            <p>
               <hi>Except they be lawfully called thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A lawfull calling is partly internal,
partly external, the Internal part thereof
conſiſteth in two things.</p>

               </gap> mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

            <p>Secondly, in having ſome competent
ability to diſcharge that <hi>Office,</hi> I ſay com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent:
For for theſe things who are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient?
It is a Burthen too heavy for the
back of an Angel; Some skill in <hi>Greek,</hi> and
<hi>Hebrew</hi> that he may competently recover
the Scripture in the <hi>Original.</hi> Some skill
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:114641:45"/>
in Logick to analize the Scripture aright.
For although the words of the Apoſtle,
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Rightly dividing the word of
truth,</hi> be principally intended, <hi>Theological</hi>
diviſions (giving comfort to whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
terrour to whom terrour belongs) yet
even <hi>Logicall</hi> dividing is neceſſary for the
clear parcelling and expounding the word.
Some skill not in <hi>vain</hi> but <hi>full Philoſophy</hi>
to underſtand the <hi>Metaphors</hi> of <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Know here, great the difference of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in ſeveral ages. In <hi>time of general ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
a leſſer degree of knowledge</hi> muſt
be admitted: Sad the times in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when by her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties</hi>
injunctions, the <hi>Clergy</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
to read the <hi>Chapters</hi> over once
or twice by themſelves; that ſo they might
be the better enabled to read them diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the <hi>Congregation.</hi> Bleſſed be God,
we have an alteration to the better, and
lately there hath been plenty of able men,
were their parts but ſufficiently ſanctified;
which hath brought me to the third part
of the <hi>Internal Call</hi> viz. <hi>Inward Holineſs</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is mainly material as rendred for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114641:45"/>
a reaſon of the extraordinary ſucceſs of
the <hi>ministery</hi> of <hi>Barnabas,</hi> Acts 11. <hi>Why
much people were added to the Lord,</hi> by his
preaching. <hi>For he was a good man, and
full of the Holy Christ and of faith,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I deny not but it may be poſſible
even for a wicked miniſter, <hi>virtute officij</hi>
by virtue of his office to convert others
to God. But far betterit is when done
<hi>officio virtutis,</hi> by the office and efficacy
of his virtues, as the Inſtrumental cauſe
thereof. True it is <hi>Daniel</hi> 12. 3. <hi>They that
turn many to righteouſneſs ſhall be as the
ſtars for ever and ever,</hi> but what went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the ſame verſe; <hi>and they that be
wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament.</hi>
And what ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> Prov. 9.
22. <hi>If thou be wiſe thou ſhalt be wiſe for
thy ſelf, chiefly</hi> labouring to make <hi>his own
calling and election ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>External call</hi> conſiſts, firſt, in the
approbation of ſuch in the Church, which
have power and place to examine them.
For know, all men by nature have <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicean
humour</hi> in their ſouls, ready to ſay,
<hi>I am rich, and have need of nothing, when</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:114641:46"/>
               <hi>indeed they are poor and have need of all
things.</hi> I have <hi>gifts,</hi> I have <hi>graces</hi> fit to
make a <hi>miniſter,</hi> will <hi>ſwelling emptineſs</hi>
ſay, when <hi>modeſt abilility</hi> is often ſilent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now let another praiſe thee, and not thy
own mouth.</hi> Let guilty droſs decline the
<hi>Touch-ſtone;</hi> good gold rejoyceth when
brought thereunto, <hi>But let theſe alſo firſt
be proved.</hi> A great Emphaſis is couched
in <hi>alſo,</hi> how good ſoever they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported:
let their <hi>honeſty</hi> and <hi>ability</hi> both
of them be firſt examined, wherein eminent
holineſs may make the leſs knowledge to
paſs currant, but no knowledge how great
ſoever can qualifie profaneſs for the <hi>Office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all theſe will not do the deed to
make a <hi>Lawfull miniſter,</hi> ſtill <hi>one thing,</hi>
and but <hi>one thing</hi> is wanting, and that is
<hi>ordination,</hi> Acts 14. B. <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. the <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity</hi>
whereof with the <hi>Ceremony</hi> uſed
thereat are ſet forth in <hi>ſcripture.</hi> This done
after the <hi>Internal,</hi> and <hi>External call</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated
by <hi>Approbation</hi> and, <hi>Ordination,</hi>
let one ſo qualified preach the word, be
inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, reprove,
rebuke, exhort, with all long-ſuffering and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114641:46"/>
               <hi>Doctrine, The Lord proſper the work of his
hands, yea, the Lord proſper his handy work,
we have wiſhed him good ſucceſs in the name
of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come we now to reſume our main <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi>
which is this. <hi>None may ordinarily
execute the Office of a Preacher, except law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
called thereunto.</hi> This firſt, appears
by the <hi>Legall Prieſthood</hi> appropriated to
the <hi>Sons of Levi,</hi> and two <hi>eminent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
one to <hi>Forraigners</hi> uſurping the
ſame, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> a private man, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> a <hi>King,</hi>
to ſhew, that neither high nor low may
be excuſed therein. <hi>Uzzah</hi> to the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,
Uzziah</hi> to the <hi>Temple.</hi> To ſhew that
whether the <hi>Church</hi> be in motion, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluctuating
and tottering condition, or
<hi>Temple-like</hi> in a ſtanding and ſetled eſtate,
none can be defended: <hi>Uzzah</hi> out of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
miſtaking meaning well: <hi>Uzziah</hi> out
of mere pride of heart lifting up himſelf,
to ſhew, that God will not hold them guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
be their intentions good or bad, <hi>Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah</hi>
favoured, (at leaſtwiſe not oppoſed)
by the beholders, and pitied by <hi>David</hi>
himſelf. <hi>Uzziah</hi> reſiſted by the <hi>Prieſts,</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:114641:47"/>
to ſhew, that whether men do or do not
miſlike ſuch intruſion, it is unlawfull in
it ſelf. <hi>Uzzah</hi> inſtanly ſmitten with death,
<hi>Uzziah</hi> with a long and lingering ſickneſs
parted from publick ſociety, to ſhew that
divine juſtice goeth not always the ſame
path; and the ſame place in puniſhing <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here it is not unworthy our notice,
that though <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made <hi>Prieſts</hi> of
the meaneſt of the people (without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to the <hi>Tribe of Levi</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 31.
never giving his negative voice for any
mans worthineſs, but whoſoever would
might be a <hi>Prieſt.</hi> Yet even thoſe <hi>Prieſts,</hi>
did not officiate till the Ceremony of a
mock-conſecration was paſſed upon them,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. 9. <hi>With the ſacrifice of a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock
and ſeven Rams:</hi> Well did that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Politician</hi> know, that except ſome ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
was uſed to ſeparate his <hi>Prieſts,</hi> as
mean as they were, from common people,
his prophane Religion would quickly be
contemned and confounded.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This may be proved by the
<hi>ſolemn calling</hi> and <hi>Commiſsion</hi> of <hi>Chriſts
Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:114641:47"/>
Their <hi>Calling</hi> conſiſted in, <hi>Come hither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Commiſsion</hi> conſiſted in, <hi>Go therefore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Calling,</hi> Mark 3. 13. <hi>And he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
up into a mountain and calleth unto him
whom he would, and they came unto him.</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (whence our <hi>Engliſh Call</hi>) it
was not <hi>who would come,</hi> but <hi>whom he
called, Chriſt</hi> invites all to <hi>ſalvation. Come
unto me all ye that are heavy laden,</hi> onely
ſome to the <hi>miniſterial Function.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It was <hi>Moſes</hi> his wiſh <hi>Num.</hi> 11.
27. <hi>Would God that all the Lords people
were Prophets;</hi> what he deſired is now
done, what then wiſhed is now wrought:
then prayed for, now performed. The
<hi>Pulpit</hi> (or <hi>Prophecying</hi>) according to <hi>Moſes</hi>
his wiſh is now open to all, and ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the <hi>envious ſpirit</hi> of <hi>Joſhua</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
thereat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> It followeth not that thoſe things
either <hi>ſhould be,</hi> or which every good man
in holy zeal doth deſire. I will not inſtance
in the wiſh of <hi>Daniel, O King live for ever,</hi>
leaſt any ſay, that was but a <hi>Court-comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>Romans</hi> 10. <hi>Brethren
my hearts deſire for Iſrael is, that they may</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:114641:48"/>
               <hi>be ſaved.</hi> Iſrael indefinitely, that is <hi>Iſrael</hi>
univerſally, though it neither could nor
would be ſo, as contrary to the will and
pleaſure of God in that particular: Thus
The Expreſſions of <hi>Moſes</hi> was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
extravagancie of his pious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
but not the exact Standard by
adaequation, whereunto the lawfullneſs of
all mens Propheſying ſhould be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>The ſecond part of their Commiſſion
conſiſts in <hi>Go therefore.</hi> I confeſs the
<hi>Apostles,</hi> when firſt ſent to preach, <hi>Matth.</hi>
10. 5. Had but a limited or confined <hi>Go,
ago,</hi> which began with, go not, <hi>go not in
the way of the Gentiles, but go rather to the
lost ſheep of</hi> Iſrael. But after <hi>Chriſt</hi> his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
their Commiſſion was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<hi>go ye therefore and teach all nations—and
lo I am with you always even to the
end of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men and Brethren let me freely ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you af the Apoſtles, that they are both dead
and buried, and their ſepulchers</hi> (though
uuknown, are amongſt us unto this day,
<hi>Chriſt</hi> therefore promiſing to be with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:114641:48"/>
them to the end of the world, therein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
intendeth their poſterity and lawfull
ſucceſſours. And this is the Chartar from
whence we <hi>miniſters,</hi> lawfully ordained,
juſtly derive our Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>A Third argument might be fetched
from the practice of the primitive Church,
wherein preaching was onely practiſed
by ſuch as were lawfully ordained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
which may be cleared by authority
out of the <hi>Fathers.</hi> But I purpoſely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
this reaſon remembring how <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>
ſerved the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> when faſtened
<hi>Judges</hi> 16. 14. <hi>by his locks with a pin:</hi> For
<hi>he went away with the pin of the beam;</hi>
Thus when we think to have our <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries</hi>
in this point ſafe and faſt, when by
an argument fetcht from <hi>Church-practiſe</hi>
we ſtake them down to the <hi>Primitive times,</hi>
away they carry pin and all by ſlighting
and contemning ſuch ancient practiſes, as
no ways concluding them to conform
thereunto.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, this appeareth by ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15. <hi>How ſhall</hi>
they preach except they be ſent. <hi>Now ſhall</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:114641:49"/>
               <hi>they preach.</hi> That is profitably to others,
comfortably to themſelves, with an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
of <hi>Divine Direction, Protection,
Benediction.</hi> It is ſaid in the fore-going
words, <hi>how ſhall they hear without a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
to ſhew that it is equally impoſſible
for men <hi>to hear without a preacher,</hi> as to
<hi>preach lawfully</hi> without <hi>ſending.</hi> Let ſuch,
who pretend to preach without a <hi>call,</hi> try
if they can <hi>hear without a preacher.</hi> This
they will never preſume to do, as knowing
that they ſhall quickly be confuted by the
reſt in the room, which can hear nothing
where nothing is ſpoken, though they
have as quick ears as any others.</p>
            <p>Secondly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 17. <hi>If the whole
body were an eye, where were the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
Prophets</hi> we know are termed <hi>Seers,</hi>
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 9. Now where all the body is
<hi>ſight,</hi> that may be truly termed not a <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
miſtical</hi> but <hi>monstrous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here I lay this down for a poſition
of undoubted truth, that although ſome
not called to be <hi>miniſters</hi> are often ſaid
in Scripture to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>inſtruct;</hi> yet none
are ſaid to <hi>preach,</hi> but ſuch who have a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114641:49"/>
               <hi>publick calling</hi> thereunto, take it in the
verbe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to preach,</hi> or in the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

               </gap>, <hi>preaching,</hi> or in

<hi>preacher,</hi> in all theſe the word is onely predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
of ſuch, who had a <hi>ſolemne vocation,</hi>
and were entered into the <hi>miniſtery;</hi> I ſay
again the aforeſaid word <hi>preaching</hi> with
its <hi>derivatives,</hi> being uſed more than ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventie
times in the <hi>new Teſtament</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
confined either to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or to his
<hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or to his <hi>Diſciples,</hi> or to the <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi>
or to ſome publick perſons, making
the ſame their <hi>proper functions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Abate me onely two places, one <hi>Mark</hi>
1. 45. Whereof the man cleanſed of the
<hi>Leproſie</hi> it is ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>The other <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 36. of the dumb

               </gap>.
But here the diſtinction of our
<hi>Tranſlatours</hi> is commendable; who no
doubt obſerving the conſtant tenour of
<hi>Scripture</hi> (the beſt way to expound words
therein) and finding the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
generally to men of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114641:50"/>
profeſſion have rendered the word
here not to <hi>preach</hi> but to <hi>publiſh,</hi> Mark
1. 45. <hi>But he went out and began to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
it much;</hi> Mark 7. 36. <hi>So much the
more a great deal they publiſh it.</hi> So that
without any exception at all the rule notes
univerſally true in our tranſlation through
the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that <hi>preaching</hi> is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
attributed to publick perſons appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the ſame.</p>
            <p>Uſe. <hi>To confute ſuch who maintain, that
men gifted, though not called, may preach.</hi>
But let us examine what manner of gifts
they pretend.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſome gifts are ſuch as may be
ſaid eminently to contain a <hi>calling</hi> in them
namely ſuch, which—preſently and
perfectly are beſtowed upon men, If a
mean man utterly unlettered ſhall in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
be furniſhed with <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were (not gaining them
by degrees with <hi>ſtudy</hi> and <hi>induſtry</hi>) ſuch
a one would ſtartle, us if challenging <hi>ipſo
facto</hi> to be a <hi>miniſter,</hi> becauſe miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
enabled for the ſame. And yet we
may obſerve, that God to keep order and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:114641:50"/>
regulariry in his <hi>Church</hi> ſolemnly ſent ſuch,
who were thus immediately qualified to
the <hi>Churches</hi> approbation. <hi>Witneſs Paul</hi>
and <hi>Barnabas;</hi> who notwithſtanding their
rich endowments were in this Chapter ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
ſeparated verſe 3 with the faſting
and prayer of the Church, with their hands
layed on them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore I ſay again ſhould ſuch a
perſon appear, <hi>commencing per ſaltum,</hi>
compleate in all <hi>ſciences,</hi> and <hi>languages,</hi> ſo
that all the tongues, which departed from
<hi>Babel</hi> in a <hi>confuſion,</hi> ſhould meet in his
mouth in a <hi>method,</hi> it would give aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to others, that theſe his gifts <hi>came
down from the Father</hi> of lights, if willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſubmitting himſelf to the <hi>examination,</hi>
and <hi>ordination</hi> of ſuch to whom it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
doth belong. Otherwiſe if amongſt
all other gifts; the eſſential grace of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
be wanting, it will render the reſt
ſuſpected from what fountain they do
proceed.</p>
            <p>But let us ſurvey what gifts thoſe are,
which generally are moſt boaſted of by
<hi>oppoſers</hi> in this point. God is my witneſs,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114641:51"/>
I ſpeak it without bitterneſs or any Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall
reflection. Are they not for the moſt
part ſuch as may be reduced to boldneſs,
confidence, memory, and volubility of
tongue. Might they not truely ſay of many
of their Sermons what the <hi>Son</hi> of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
ſaid of their <hi>Axe</hi> 2 Kings 6. 5. <hi>Alas
its borrowed,</hi> venting chiefly the notes and
endeavours of others.</p>
            <p>But grant their <hi>gifts</hi> never ſo <hi>great, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
ſo <hi>good, parts</hi> ſo <hi>perfect, endowments</hi>
ſo <hi>excellent,</hi> yet meer <hi>gifting</hi> without <hi>call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
makes not a <hi>lawfull Preacher.</hi> This
appears by <hi>Chriſts practice,</hi> Luke 4. 26.
where we read it was his cuſtom to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Synagogues</hi> every <hi>Sabbath day.</hi> All
this time <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>admirably gifted,</hi> and
<hi>endowed</hi> with <hi>Gods ſpirit.</hi> The <hi>miniſter</hi> of
<hi>Nazareth</hi> might ſay to our <hi>Saviour</hi> more
truly than <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt: I have need
to come to thee, and comeſt thou to me.</hi> He
was able to teach his <hi>Teachers,</hi> yet all this
while he was ſilent, tooke not on him the
<hi>Office of a Preacher,</hi> and why, becauſe as
yet he had not received his <hi>Commiſſion</hi>
from God for that <hi>Office,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114641:51"/>
till he was paſt thirty years of age, he
was contented probably to follow his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
calling</hi> of a <hi>Carpenter, Mark</hi> 6. 3. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly)
to conceal himſelf in a private
condition, For it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 27.
<hi>From that time Jeſus began to preach, and
to ſay, repent, for the Kingdom of heaven
is at hand,</hi> that is, from the time that <hi>John</hi>
the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> was ſhut up in <hi>Priſon.</hi> For fit
it was that the <hi>day-ſtar</hi> ſhould ſet before
the <hi>Sun</hi> did ariſe; Abating therefore one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that Eſſay which he made <hi>Luke</hi> 2. When
he <hi>Diſputed with the D<hi rend="sup">r•.</hi> in the Temple,</hi> he
adventured not on any publick perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of preaching, as well knowing, that
his exquiſite accompliſhments would not
bear him out therein, except ſolemnly
called thereunto.</p>
            <p>Remarkeable alſo is his anſwer to
the <hi>Phariſees</hi> queſtion, demanding of
him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 23. as he was teaching,
<hi>by what authority doſt thou theſe things,
and who gave thee this authority;</hi> which
plainly ſheweth, that the <hi>Pulpit</hi> in that age
did not lye open in common, to any who
would ſtock the ſame, but was ſequeſtred
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114641:52"/>
to ſelect perſons approved for the place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Yea, our <hi>Saviour,</hi> doth not deny he had
authority, but denies to tell them what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
he had tacitely; confeſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
obnoxious to juſt cenſure, if being a
mere private man without <hi>Commiſsion</hi>
either <hi>ordinary,</hi> or <hi>extraordinary</hi> (ſuch his
licenſe <hi>ad praedicandum</hi>) he had wounded
that <hi>profeſsion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If a <hi>maſter</hi> may teach his <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
he may preach in the <hi>Church.</hi> For what
is a <hi>Family</hi> but a <hi>ſmall Church,</hi> or a <hi>Church</hi>
but a <hi>great Family.</hi> The place makes no,
difference in the <hi>Duty,</hi> nor doth the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of people alter the nature of the <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe.</hi>
Beſides it is poſſible that ſome <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Family,</hi> may have more people in it
than ſome <hi>narrow Pariſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer. The latter is confeſt, but the
main is this; His <hi>calling</hi> extends onely to
his <hi>Family,</hi> exceeding which compaſs his
voice (how ſtentorious ſoever) is affectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dumb, as to any <hi>converting operation,</hi>
be cauſe deſerting his <hi>vocation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet of ſuch gifted men, who without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
preſume to preach, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerve
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114641:52"/>
two ranks or kinds, firſt thoſe who
hold another calling (as I may ſay) in
<hi>commendum</hi> with preaching, and diſcharge
both employments. Secondly, ſuch who
quit &amp; forſake their former calling, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
themſelves wholy to preach the Word:</p>
            <p>To the former of theſe, I commend the
words of the Diſciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 2. <hi>It is
not reaſon that we ſhould leave the word of
God and ſerve Tables.</hi> which tendereth two
remarkeables to our conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> would not be <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralliſts
in profeſſions,</hi> nor retain two <hi>callings</hi>
at the ſame time, and yet <hi>ſerving of Tables</hi>
in that ſence [that is, overſeeing the poor]
was more compatible with <hi>preaching</hi> than
any other employment, as being in its own
nature of a <hi>charitable constitution,</hi> and an
<hi>office</hi> afterwards uſed in the <hi>Church</hi> as an
entrance of <hi>Probationers</hi> into the <hi>miniſtery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> refuſal to be
double-called at once proceeded from one
or both of theſe reaſons. Either becauſe
they accounted it too heavy a taske for
one perſon, though they were moſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly
accompliſhed, in which reſpect
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114641:53"/>
the ability, and activity of their parts
might have as much <hi>ubiquitarineſs,</hi> as mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
man can pretend to, to be preſent at
once in diſtant employments. Or elſe their
recuſancy was cauſed from an apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it was diſgracefull <hi>unequally to yoke</hi>
the preaching of <hi>Gods word</hi> with any other
vocation, and beneath the dignity thereof
to couple it with a <hi>ſerving of Tables.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly we ſee they were reſolved, as to
let go the meaner, ſo to retain the moſt
noble and neceſſary function of preaching,
whence moſt glory redoundeth to God,
and profit to his people.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>How then can men now adays of mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
parts and endowments diſcharge that,
which the</hi> Apoſtles <hi>did decline</hi> Preach; the
Word, <hi>&amp;</hi> ſerve a Ship, Preach the Word, <hi>and</hi>
ſerve a Shop, Preach the Word, <hi>and</hi> ſerve
the Loomes, Preach the Word, <hi>and</hi> ſerve the
Laſt, <hi>retaining either</hi> manual <hi>or</hi> military
employment <hi>with the ſame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It is lawfull for men to practice
a <hi>mechanick calling</hi> in conjunction with
their preaching, warranted by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, building at the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114641:53"/>
ſame time the <hi>Tents of men,</hi> and the <hi>Temple
of God.</hi> Yea, he ſaith himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 34.
<hi>yea, you your ſelves know; that theſe hands
have miniſtred unto my neceſsities, and again</hi>
1 Corinth. 4. 12. <hi>and labour working with
our own hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>Extraordinary accidents</hi> are not
to be drawn into <hi>ordinary practice.</hi> The
Apoſtle did not this commonly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly,
but for a ſhort time, at a very pinch,
out of a holy deſign, namely to ſtarve the
<hi>falſe Prophets</hi> amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
and therefore this his act ought not to be
precedential to others, who are to apply
themſelves totally to the <hi>ministery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others there are which wholly deſert
their former <hi>vocation,</hi> and betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
totally to the <hi>preaching of the
word.</hi> To the ſerious thoughts of ſuch I
offer the words of St. <hi>Peter</hi> 14. 15. <hi>But
let none of you ſuffer as a Murderer, or as a
Thief, or as an evil Doer, or as a buſie body
in other mens matters.</hi> See what a <hi>crew</hi>
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath choſen out, as onely fit
to keep company with <hi>buſie bodies;</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>buſie-bodyneſs</hi> is an hainous offence of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114641:54"/>
greater guilt than men generally do know,
or will acknowledge. <hi>Noſcitur è ſocio,</hi> dark
men are expounded by their companions.
The great offence therein appeareth by
ſuch with whom the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth aſſociate
them; And what greater <hi>buſie-body,</hi> than he
who invadeth the <hi>Hardeſt,</hi> and <hi>Higheſt,</hi> and
<hi>Holieſt</hi> of profeſſions, never ordained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
contrary to the <hi>Councel</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
of Chorinth. 7. 24. <hi>Brethren let every one
wherein he is called, therein abide with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here with all reſervation of due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
and deſerved honour to men of
<hi>military profeſsion;</hi> I humbly conceive that
it may be plainly proved out of Scripture,
that <hi>Souldiery</hi> and <hi>Miniſtery</hi> were ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
callings, that they met not in one
and the ſame profeſſion. For the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
being to prove the equity and right of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi>
maintenance, fetcheth an argument,
of <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. From the wages juſtly due
unto <hi>Souldiers. Who goeth to Warfare at
any time on his own charges,</hi> and thence
concludeth <hi>verſe</hi> 14. <hi>Even ſo hath the Lord
ordained, that they which preach the Goſpel,
ſhould live of the Goſpel.</hi> Which words, if
peruſed with unpartial eyes, they ſet up
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114641:54"/>
a partition betwixt the two <hi>callings</hi> as not
then concurring in the ſame perſons.</p>
            <p>And here take notice of a ſtrange and
incredible alteration within this laſt ten
years in <hi>England,</hi> that either men are
ſuddenly grown more able than before
or elſe the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> is become more eaſie
than in former ages. Some ten years
ſince when thoſe of the <hi>Clergy</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the <hi>Commiſsion of the peace,</hi> this
principall reaſon is rendered in the Act,
why <hi>miniſters</hi> ſhould not be admitted <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of the Peace,</hi> becauſe <hi>preaching of the
word</hi> is enough <hi>to take up the</hi> whole man,
ſo that they muſt be wanting to the calling
of their <hi>miniſteriall function,</hi> if attending
at the ſame time another employment.</p>
            <p>And yet ſee now on a ſuddain, ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themſelves able ſufficiently to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
a <hi>manual trade</hi> all the <hi>weeke,</hi> and alſo
qualified for preaching on the <hi>Lords
day</hi> after. I ſay again, either men in our
age are mounted on a ſuddain to be more
dextrous and knowing, or the miniſtery is
ſtooped to be more facile and obvious, or
(which I fear is the trueſt) men are grown
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114641:55"/>
more daring impudent and prophane than
in the days of our <hi>Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh let ſuch remember what is written
in the <hi>Prophetical Epiſtle</hi> of St. <hi>Jude</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
laſt and next to the <hi>Revelation,</hi> as
containing the prediction of ſuch things
as ſhould happen in the <hi>Church</hi> towards
the end of the world <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. <hi>and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the gain-ſaying of Korah.</hi> What
<hi>gain-ſaying</hi> this was we all know, <hi>Num.</hi>
16. 4. partly conſiſting in challenging
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to take too much upon
them, partly in preſuming to perform the
<hi>High Priests office.</hi> Their <hi>periſhing</hi> alſo is
notoriouſly known, <hi>the earth ſwallowing
them up,</hi> and this excellent note deſerveth
our beſt heed in it (becauſe ſtragling out
of the body of that Hiſtory) <hi>Num.</hi> 26. 11.
<hi>notwithſtanding the Children of</hi> Korah
<hi>dyed not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God in like manner, no doubt, may and
will out of pity preſerve the <hi>Children of
Korah,</hi> ſuch ſeduced perſons, whoſe ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
is practiſed on by the ſubtility of
others; but oh let thoſe look to it who are
<hi>Ringleaders</hi> herein, that Gods juſtice may
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114641:55"/>
be no looſer in the main, he will take off
from the children and lay load on the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
Pardon well meaning perſons impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
on by others, and ſeverely cenſure their
Conductours, if not ſeaſonably compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>And here I requeſt the unpartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſeriouſly to peruſe the following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fox</hi> 2 Tom pag. 278</note>
being the words of Mr. <hi>Bilney</hi> at the
ſtake, as he ſtood ready to ſeal the truth
with his blood. Having made a brief repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of the <hi>Articles of his faith,</hi> coming to
theſe words; <hi>I believe</hi> the Catholick
Church, pauſed awhile &amp; then proceeded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good people, I muſt here confeſs to have
offended the Church, in preaching once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the prohibition of the ſame, at a poor
Cure belonging to Trinity Hall in Cambridge,
where I was Fellow, earnestly intreated
thereunto by the Curate, and other good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Pariſh; ſhewing, that they had no
ſermon there of long time before, and ſo in
my conſcience moved,</hi> I <hi>did make a poor col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to them, and thereby ran into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience
of certain authority in the Church,
by whom I was prohibited: Howbeit I truſt</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:114641:56"/>
               <hi>at the general day, charity that moved me
to this Act, ſhall bear me out at the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſeat
of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many things herein are conſiderable.
Firſt, <hi>Bilney</hi> at this time was a <hi>Maſter of
Arts</hi> at leaſt, and able to diſcharge the
place. Secondly, being <hi>Fellow</hi> of that <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
which was <hi>Patron</hi> to the <hi>Church;</hi> he
had ſome obligation in conſcience to ſee
the place provided for: Thirdly, invited
by the <hi>Curate</hi> and the <hi>Pariſh,</hi> it ſeemeth
to amount to a ſufficient calling; Laſtly, the
long want of the Word in that place, might
make him compaſſionate their condition.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this <hi>four-fold-cable</hi> to
<hi>draw on Bilney</hi> to this <hi>performance,</hi> he ſaith,
he did it but once, he made not a common
and conſtant practice thereof, Secondly,
he did not pleaſe or delight himſelf in the
memory of what he had done, nor maketh
he mention thereof in a <hi>rejoycing,</hi> much
leſs in a <hi>bragging manner;</hi> but onely by
way of neceſſary excuſe, as ſomewhat
troubled at the deed done, but hoping (as
well he might) that God beholding the
act, as qualified with the aforeſaid circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:114641:56"/>
and proceeding from a pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
would acquit him from any guilt
therein.</p>
            <p>Let ſuch lay this to their hearts, who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the tithe of <hi>Bilney</hi> his ability, undeſired
by the <hi>Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>place,</hi> (yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
againſt his will) do not with <hi>Bilney
but once,</hi> but make an uſual practice and
common cuſtom to preach againſt the
<hi>prohibition of the Church,</hi> whoſe <hi>ancient
Canons</hi> have ordered it, that none except
<hi>Probationers</hi> by way of <hi>Trial,</hi> may preach
the word. It is to be feared that many
who run before <hi>Bilney</hi> into the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> will
ſcarce halt after him to follow him to the
<hi>ſtake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However let us Miniſters, make a ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
in our own ſouls, what may be the
reaſon that we are fallen into ſuch diſgrace.
So that God in his juſtice hath permitted
our function (formerly fenced about from
common feet with an awfull reverence)
now for any to enter upon it, Pſal. 80. 12.
<hi>Why haſt thou broken down our hedges:</hi> haſt
broken them, that is, haſt permitted others
to break them. Sure ſomething is in it
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114641:57"/>
more than we miniſters generally take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, that God hath expoſed us and our
calling to contempt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tully</hi> in his firſt <hi>Oration</hi> againſt <hi>Catilin,</hi>
being himſelf then <hi>Conſul</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

(ſpeaking of <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> and himſelf)
we Generals are wanting in our places.</p>
            <p>In like manner we may ſay, <hi>nos ſacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,

32. <hi>begins to cut us ſhort,</hi> pareth us in our
Profeſſion, abateth us in our honour, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth
us in our dignity. Let us ſearch
out the cauſe diligently, and having found
it, zealouſly endeavour to remove it, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
if we honour God, he will honour us,
but if we proceed in our ſins, he will
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114641:57"/>
proceed to pour more ſhame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
upon us, till our calling, whoſe repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
begins daily to leſſen, become at laſt
(though to the confuſion of ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
it) a very ſhame and reproach.</p>
            <p>And now I truſt that none can take juſt
exception at what I have freely, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpleen or malice ſpoken of the blame worthy
practices of ſuch, who intrude
themſelves into our Profeſſion, having un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
reproved even my ſelf and thoſe
of my own function: and thus my ſword
having equally cut on both ſides; I now
put it up into the ſheath, never to be drawn
in this place or quarrel again.</p>

Such a Petition need never doubt of

            </p>
            <p>2. A reaſon to edge and enforce the

the <hi>Baptist, as</hi> John <hi>alſo taught his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
            </p>

of him, that he was more than a Prophet;
that he was the ſecond</hi> Elias, <hi>and none great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

Now he had Diſciples as you have, and it

            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:114641:60"/>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> How often is this When to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
and what rules can you give us by
what number we ſhould regulate our quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian
Devotions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, I will tell you how often I
finde a <hi>Saint</hi> and <hi>ſervant of God</hi> in <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
to pray; but on this condition, that
you will promiſe not to be frighted with
the prodigious number of his dayly devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The <hi>party</hi> is <hi>David,</hi> who ſaith thus
of himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 164. <hi>Seven times a
day do I praiſe thee.</hi> Admirable, how could
<hi>David</hi> ſpare ſo much time from his <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi>
and <hi>publick employments;</hi> not to ſpeak
of his <hi>Family affairs,</hi> having <hi>ſix Wives,</hi>
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 5. ten <hi>Concubines</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 26.
and more Children by them, which muſt
needs perplex him with much Domeſtical
buſineſs. <hi>David</hi> was a <hi>mortal King,</hi> and
needs muſt be employed in multiplicity
of matters. Now to ſend diſpatches to
that <hi>Foreign Agent,</hi> read the received In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
from him, give audience to this
Embaſſadour, ſend Orders to that General,
Inſtructions to that Commander, be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the Council, hear Petitions, judge
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114641:60"/>
cauſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt needs engroſs much time,
yet <hi>David</hi> in all this term of buſineſs
found a conſtant vacation, wherein he
might perform ſeven times his dayly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions.
And though ſeven may here ſeem
a certain for an uncertain number, yet
probable it is, <hi>David</hi> rather exceeded, than
fell ſhort of the ſame.</p>
            <p>One asked a <hi>Phyloſopher,</hi> what was the
beſt time for a man to eat in, to whom he
ingeniouſly replyed, <hi>A rich man may eat
when he pleaſe, a poor man when he can,</hi> his
witty anſwer may afford us this grave ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;
Be thou poor, or be thou rich,
pray thou both when thou wilt and when
thou canſt, as often as thou haſt either ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,
or conveniency; I will not ſtint
thee to Canonicall hours, but embrace all
opportunities that are rendered unto thee,
to expreſs thy ſervice to God in thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But it ſeems we are obliged to
conſtant praying, as the <hi>Euchites</hi> did in the
<hi>Primitive Church,</hi> ſeeing the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith,
1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>pray continually, or pray with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ceaſing,</hi> and if ſo, if all our performance
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114641:61"/>
be praying, how ſhall we attend our callings
and concionably diſcharge our other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt in Scripture-language, that
is ſaid to be done continually which is done
every morning, and every night, <hi>Exodus</hi>
29. 38. <hi>Now this is that which thou ſhalt
offer upon the Altar, two Lambs of the firſt
year day by day continually;</hi> and this was
conſtantly called <hi>Juge-ſarificium</hi> or the
continual ſacrifice, <hi>Numbers</hi> 28. 3. and
the 6. 10. <hi>Ezra</hi> 3. 5. In proportion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
whoſoever conſtantly prayeth morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and evening, though following his
calling, and attending his own occaſions
all the intermediate time, may be ſaid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> precept, to <hi>pray
continually or without ceaſing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, by <hi>praying continually or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ceaſing,</hi> is meant, <hi>Endeavours ſo to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
thy ſoul, as always to be in a praying ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie,
though not actually praying, yet be not
put paſt an abilitie to diſcharge that Duty.</hi>
Such therefore who are ſo diſcompoſed
with ſin or ſinfull paſſion, that they are
rendered thereby utterly impotent to pray,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114641:61"/>
ſin againſt the command of the <hi>Apoſtle.</hi>
Otherwiſe it is no breach thereof to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their prayers and ceaſe ſometimes
from the ſame, it being ſaid of our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi>
himſelf in the <hi>verſe</hi> before our Text,
<hi>As he was praying in a certain place when
he ceaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Uſe.</hi> Muſt we finde a ſet time to pray?
ſerveth this to confute ſuch who can afford
a <hi>When</hi> to <hi>Eat,</hi> and a <hi>When</hi> to <hi>Drink,</hi> a
<hi>When</hi> to <hi>Sleep,</hi> a <hi>When</hi> to <hi>Talk,</hi> and a <hi>When</hi>
to <hi>Walke;</hi> and a <hi>When</hi> to <hi>Work,</hi> and a <hi>When</hi>
to <hi>Play:</hi> but cannot finde out a <hi>When</hi> to
<hi>Pray</hi> according to our <hi>Saviour</hi> his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
When ye pray.</hi> Yet God, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 1.
hath made a time for all things, ſave that
which man doth at all times, I mean ſin.
How many are there <hi>that pinch on Gods
ſide,</hi> and as the croud of People, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 45.
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
throng thee, and preſs thee; ſo world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men, to make room for their temporal
affairs, thruſt, throng, contract, yea ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
do wholy juſtle out and omit their
dayly Devotions.</p>
            <p>Come we now to the perſon, <hi>ye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:114641:62"/>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Were not <hi>Chriſts Diſciples</hi> able
to pray before this time? Sure I am, they
were able to caſt out Devils. For it is ſaid
in the foregoing Chapter <hi>verſe</hi> 17. <hi>And
the ſeventy returned again with joy, ſaying,
Lord, even the Devils are ſubject unto us
through thy name.</hi> Now to caſt out Devils
is a harder thing than to pray, becauſe
ſome Devils are of ſo ſullen and ſurly a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 17. 21. That they go not out
<hi>but by prayer and faſting;</hi> Being thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
impowered with ability to caſt out
Divels, ſurely the greater did include the
leſſer, and it is wonder they ſhould now
deſire a Direction to pray. Say not that
<hi>Chriſt</hi> made a reſumption of that power
which once he beſtowed upon them, and
after their return from preaching depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them of them; ſeeing, <hi>Romans</hi> 11. 29.
<hi>the gifts of God are without repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Some anſwer this by pleading a
Metatheſis or transpoſition in the Hiſtory
of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> ſetting down that firſt which
was laſt done, a figure very frequent in the
Old Teſtament. But this is, though the
beſt of ſhifts yet the worſt of anſwers, laſt
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114641:62"/>
to be tried, and leaſt to be truſted, ſaving
in ſuch caſes as ſeem to be capable of no
other ſolution. No need of this refuge at
this time, and therefore we decline the
ſame.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it is anſwered, that it is a
greater argument of Gods favour to us,
and our ſincerity to him, if we can power
forth unto him an acceptable prayer, then
if enabled to diſpoſſeſs Devils. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
by the <hi>Plea</hi> of the Reprobate to
<hi>Chriſt</hi> at the laſt judgement, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22.
<hi>Many will ſay unto me in that day, Lord,
Lord, have we not propheſied in thy Name,
and in thy Name have caſt out Devils, and
in thy Name have done many wonderfull
works?</hi> Nor doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> confute what they
alleadge as falſe, but reject it as in ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
<hi>Verily I ſay unto you, I know you not.</hi>
Thus ſuch miraculous endowments are
compatible with damnation: whileſt the
<hi>Spirit of ſupplication</hi> (enabling us to pray
acceptably to God) is none of thoſe gifts
beſtowed upon the <hi>Sons of Ketura,</hi> but ſuch
as are conferred on <hi>Iſaacs</hi> alone, given one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to us Sons, Saints, and ſervants of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:114641:63"/>
Thirdly, and chiefly I anſwer, certainly
the ſeveral <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Diſciples</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
their particular prayers; and as I
may term them, <hi>perſonal Devotions.</hi> Peter
<hi>no doubt</hi> had his, <hi>and Andrew</hi> his, <hi>James</hi>
and <hi>John</hi> their particular forms of <hi>Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</hi>
But now they deſired that <hi>Chriſt,</hi>
would gratifie them with ſuch a general
prayer, unto which they might all joyntly
concur with their <hi>Amen</hi> thereunto, and all
their ſeveral Devotions unite, and center
themſelves therein.</p>
            <p>They alſo deſired ſuch a prayer, as they
might tranſmit as an <hi>Heir-Loom</hi> to all
poſterity, and intail it on the <hi>Church</hi> to be
uſed ſucceſſively by all generations. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I hearken to the <hi>Diſciples</hi> requeſting
our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as to the mouth of all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians:</hi>
For they ſpeak as the <hi>Speakers</hi> or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutours,</hi>
for the <hi>Church</hi> in all ages deſiring
this boon to be beſtowed upon them.</p>
            <p>Here is worthy our obſervation, that
our <hi>Saviour</hi> had once formerly delivered
the ſame prayer both for the manner and
matter thereof, and yet how again at his
<hi>Diſciples</hi> requeſt, recommendeth the ſame
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114641:63"/>
(ſome inconſiderable differences abated)
unto the practice of his <hi>Diſciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For whoſoever ſhall compare this <hi>prayer</hi>
delivered by <hi>our Saviour,</hi> Matth. 6. 9. with
this made by him, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 2. Will finde
them not to be paralell places (as many
in the Goſpels) preſenting one and the ſelf
ſame matter, but two different ſtories
as will appear by the following circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
            <p>1. That was made on a mountain when
multitudes of people were gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to hear it; This compoſed in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
place when <hi>Christ</hi> was ſolitary with
his <hi>Diſciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That was freely tendered by our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>
unſought, unſued to, to all his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory;
This granted at the inſtance and
requeſt of his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to them alone.</p>
            <p>3. That was inſerted, &amp; incorporated in
the very body &amp; bowels of a moſt heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſermon. This not in preaching, but after
praying when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ceaſed from the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now might not the <hi>Diſciples</hi> have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured
hereat, might they not have ſaid,
Maſter, we expected you would have fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:114641:64"/>
us ſo far (as being your <hi>ſervants in
Ordinary</hi>) as for your ſakes to have compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
&amp; compiled a ſpick and ſpan new pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which we your <hi>Diſciples</hi> might have
uſed as a <hi>memorial</hi> of our <hi>Master.</hi> Whereas
this prayer is an old one, we heard the ſame
for all the eſſentials thereof, a twelve
month ſince in that ſermon you made on
the expoſition of the law, hence we obſerve;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>One good prayer well compoſed, the more
uſed the more acceptable to heaven;</hi> think
not, like <hi>laviſh Courtiers,</hi> our prayers ſhall
be more welcome, if always appearing in
a new ſuite, a new dreſs of language and
expreſſion.</p>
            <p>But as the good Houſe-holder, brought
out of his Treaſury <hi>things new &amp; old</hi> (onely
<hi>new,</hi> had been too <hi>prodigal,</hi> onely <hi>old</hi> had
been too <hi>penurious</hi>) ſo preſent thou to
God, new affections with thy old expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
a new degree of faith, repentance,
charity, and never fear the entertainment
of thy prayer in heaven, though it be an
old one, and the ſelf-ſame which formerly
and frequently hath been offered up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Say,</hi> Doctrine; <hi>It is not enough for men</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:114641:64"/>
               <hi>to make mentall prayers but ſometimes they
ought orally to expreſs the ſame.</hi> Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the very ſpeaking of the words doth
raiſe and rouze people from drouſineſs,
which otherwiſe may aſſault them. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
no Chriſtian ought Hypocritically to
delight in hearing the <hi>Eccho</hi> or reverbera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his own voice, yet ſometimes the
ſame may ſerve to give him the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word,
and to ſhake off that lazineſs which
too often attendeth our Devotions. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
prayers ſpoken are good for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to others, to ſhew that we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed
of Gods ſervice, but that our
tongue dare openly avouch what our heart
doth inwardly onceive. Thirdly, it is good
for the edification of others, who may ſo
far be partakers of our prayers, as to joyn
with us in them, and to be comforted by
them. A prayer concealed may have as
much heat, but a prayer expreſſed hath
more light therein, it doth ſhine before
men, and make them glorifie our Father
which is in heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 Samuel. 1. 13. <hi>Onely
moved her lips, and her voice was not heard;</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:114641:65"/>
embracing a middle way betwixt <hi>Mental</hi>
and <hi>Oral prayer,</hi> which can ſeem beſt of all
as participating of the perfections of both.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ. Hannah</hi> herein ſtands ſole and
ſingle by her ſelf. It is ſufficient that ſhe
confeſſeth her ſelf to be of a troubled and
ſorrowfull ſpirit, an excuſe for all her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
if one ſerious ſcrutiny appearing not
ſo compoſed, and therefore not to be
drawn into Precedent for others imitation.</p>
            <p>Come we now to anſwer thoſe <hi>Cavils,</hi>
which this age hath deviſed againſt the
<hi>Lords prayer;</hi> a ſubject not unneceſſary in
our days. Indeed when one had made a
large diſcourſe in the praiſe of <hi>Hercules,</hi>
and expected great commendation for the
ſame, his <hi>Audience</hi> onely anſwered his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation:
with this queſtion, <hi>quis unquam
vituperavit Herculem, whoſoever ſpake in
the diſparagement of Hercules.</hi> Intimating
thus much, that his pains might very well
be ſpared in a needleſs ſubject, all the world
acknowledging the worth and valour of
<hi>Hercules.</hi> The ſame will be ſaid of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
part of my <hi>ſermon, ut quid haec per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditios,
what needeth this wast</hi> of words and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:114641:65"/>
time, were ever any ſo impious, ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
as to doubt, much leſs deny the
divine inſpiration and dayly neceſſary and
profitable uſe of the <hi>Lords prayer?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thirdly, I believe it is almoſt
<hi>unprecedented</hi> in former ages, which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a conſtant reverence and eſteem
thereof, as the <hi>Lords prayer,</hi> and <hi>Lord of
prayers;</hi> But alas! we are fallen into ſuch
an impudent age, wherein many begin to
ſlight it, of whom I will ſay no more than
this, <hi>If they begin to think meanly of Gods
prayer, what cauſe hath God to think baſely
of theirs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I remember what <hi>John the
Baptiſt</hi> ſaid to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Matth. 3. 14.
<hi>I have need to be baptized of thee, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
thou to me.</hi> In humble alluſion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
I may ſay, my prayers have need to
come to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to mediate and intercede
to God for them, and to preſent them with
his merits to the <hi>Throne of grace:</hi> And now
<hi>his prayer comes to me,</hi> ſo the <hi>all diſpoſing
providence</hi> of God hath ordered the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that in the proſecution of my <hi>Text,</hi> I
muſt be a weak <hi>Advocate</hi> in the defence
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:114641:66"/>
thereof. The beſt is, it mattereth not who
is the <hi>Pleader</hi> when God is the <hi>Clyent,</hi> and
what is wanting in my weakneſs and
worthleſneſs, will be abundantly ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the might and merit of the ſubject
which I undertake.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is objected that it is a <hi>ſet form of
prayer,</hi> and therefore doth <hi>pinnion</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
the wings of the <hi>Dove,</hi> which ought
to be at liberty and freedom, to make
choice of his own expreſſion of it ſelf. It
is ſaid, Rom. 8. 26. <hi>The ſpirit it ſelf maketh
interceſsion for us with groans which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be uttered.</hi> It is therefore preſumption
in man to make himſelf <hi>Gods Interpreter,</hi>
and to dictate thoſe words whereby his
<hi>Spirit</hi> is to impart and communicate it ſelf
to the <hi>Throne of grace;</hi> It was charged on
the <hi>Rebellious Iſraelites,</hi> Pſal. 8. 41. That
<hi>they limited the holy one of Iſrael;</hi> no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is their practice, who offer to ſcore
out both the path &amp; pace to Gods Spirit
in prayer by pre-deſigning the <hi>Numericall
words,</hi> which are to be uſed thereby. Gods
ſervants are ſaid to be <hi>led by the ſpirit,</hi> Ro.
8. 14. And ſo alſo if ye be <hi>led by the ſpirit,</hi>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:114641:66"/>
Galatians 5. 18. But this is <hi>leading the
ſpirit,</hi> when men will guide their <hi>Conduct-our</hi>
and draw up a <hi>ſet form</hi> whereby the
ſame ſhall be directed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That ſet forms are no reſtrainings of
the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> in us, appeareth by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, Matth. 26. 44.
<hi>And went away again, and prayed the third
time ſaying the ſame words,</hi> namely the ſame
words which he uttered the ſecond time,
viz. <hi>O my Father, if this cup may not paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from me except I drink it, thy will be
done.</hi> See we here, he who made the tongue
to ſpeak, who was the <hi>frauder,</hi> and <hi>confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of all languages, who needed not by
premeditation to <hi>preſs words</hi> for his ſervice
ſeeing millions of <hi>volunteeres</hi> proffered
themſelves to be uſed by him. See I ſay,
him pleaſed notwithſtanding to reſume the
ſame individual terms which he had utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before.</p>
            <p>Secondly, next to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who may
be preſumed moſt able to pray then, the
<hi>High Prieſt Aaron,</hi> and his two <hi>inſpired
Sons Eleazer</hi> and <hi>Phineas?</hi> Yet God in their
publick bleſſings, left them not to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114641:67"/>
of their own expreſſions, <hi>Num.</hi> 6. 23.
<hi>Speak unto Aaron and unto his Sons, ſaying,
on this wiſe ye ſhall bleſs the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
ſaying unto them, the Lord bleſs thee,
and keep thee, the Lord make his face ſhine
upon thee, and be gracious unto thee, the
Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and
give thee peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs they were not confined to theſe
words on all ennergencies and occaſions,
having the latitude allowed them, that in
the <hi>Temple</hi> they might varie from this form
according to their own diſcretions. Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
the bleſſing of <hi>Eli</hi> to <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
1. 17. <hi>Go in peace, and the God of Iſrael
grant thee thy Petition, which thou haſt
asked of him;</hi> But otherwiſe God had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
them not to decede from this form:
and as <hi>Moſes</hi> was to make all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the pattern in the <hi>Mount, Heb.</hi> 8.
5. So no doubt the Prieſts conformed
themſelves in their prayer to every <hi>word,
ſyllable,</hi> and <hi>etter,</hi> of Gods preſcription,
neither detracting thence, nor adding
thereunto.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Miniſters conceived prayer</hi>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:114641:67"/>
under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> is a ſtinted and preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditated
one, to ſuch people, his <hi>Auditours,</hi>
who ay <hi>Amen</hi> thereunto: Their fancies,
and which is more, their <hi>hearts</hi> do or ſhould
go along with the <hi>Ministers</hi> words, ſo
that he boundeth their meditations, <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhall they come, and no further.</hi> If any
ſay, that notwithſtanding this Obligation
to the words of the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> they may
make their own <hi>Salleys</hi> and <hi>excurſions</hi> by
Gods ſpirit in their hearts, to enlarge
themſelves, and as it were to <hi>comment</hi> in
their <hi>ſighs</hi> and <hi>groans</hi> on the Text of the
prayers of their <hi>Miniſters,</hi> it is ſaid, that no
leſs liberty is allowed them in all preme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate
forms of prayer, where on the plain
ſong of the ſet words, the devotion of their
hearts may deſcant to their own ſpiritual
contentment.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, none will deny, but <hi>Songs</hi> and
<hi>Hymns</hi> are prayers of thanksgiving, both
thoſe which <hi>David</hi> made in the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and thoſe that were uſed by <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
in the <hi>Primitive times,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 19.
<hi>Speaking to your ſelves in Hymns and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
ſongs,</hi> Coloſ. 3. 26. <hi>Admoniſhing one</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:114641:68"/>
               <hi>another in Pſalms, and Hymns, and ſpiritual
ſongs;</hi> Now ſurely ſuch <hi>Ditties</hi> would be
bad, and <hi>Notes</hi> worſe, and the Harmonie
rather ridiculous to move laughter than
melodious to raiſe Devotions, if the ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
thereof were not predirected to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
words and ſyllables of what they ſung
and chanted in the Church.</p>
            <p>Excellent was the expreſſion of <hi>Doctor
Preſton</hi> in point of preaching, and is apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
equally to prayer. <hi>He would have a
Minister take ſuch pains in ſtudying his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
as if he relyed not only on Gods asſiſtance;
but when he cometh to preach the ſame, ſo
wholly to caſt himſelf on divine aſisſtance, as
if he relyed not at all on his own ſtudies.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
whereto, a Chriſtian ſoul may
compile and compoſe his prayer, as truſting
nothing to the Spirit, and yet in the minute
of the utterance thereof to God, ſo quit
and renounce all efficacie of premeditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as conſiſting onely in the concurrence
of Gods Spirit helping his infirmities.</p>
            <p>Yea, allow the <hi>Minister</hi> able ſtrongly to
<hi>go alone</hi> by himſelf without leaning on the
<hi>Leage</hi> of any premeditate prayer to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114641:68"/>
him, yet ſurely he may not onely law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
but laudably degrade himſelf for
the edification of others to uſe a <hi>ſet form of
prayer.</hi> We know how <hi>Jacob,</hi> able to walk
faſt himſelf, confined his feet to the pace
of the <hi>Children and Ewes big with young,
Gen.</hi> 33. 13. he would not over-drive them.
Semblably, a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> endowed by God
with the gift of extempore prayer, may
without any ſhame to himſelf, and great
profit to others, go on <hi>pedetentim</hi> in a
<hi>ſet form,</hi> ſo to bring up the rear of his moſt
lagging <hi>Auditours</hi> to go along with him,
the more knowingly from the beginning,
and cloſe their <hi>Amen</hi> with him the more
chearfully in the end of his prayer.</p>
            <p>2. Cavil. It is not a prayer of it ſelf, but
onely a pattern, or draught by which other
prayers are to be made, &amp; therfore S. <hi>Mat.</hi>
ſaith; <hi>After this manner therefore pray ye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is both a pattern for prayer, and a
prayer in it ſelf to all purpoſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.
The <hi>Standard-Buſhel,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
is chained up in the Market place, is
not onely a <hi>Buſhel</hi> to meaſure <hi>Buſhels</hi> by,
(all which ought to be adequate to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
thereof) but alſo a <hi>Buſhel</hi> to meaſure
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114641:69"/>
grain by, <hi>it may chance of Wheat, or of ſome
other grain:</hi> ſo this of our Saviour his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing,
is nevertheleſs a compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
prayer in it ſelf, although alſo it be a
Model, Type, or Copy, according to which
for the eſſentials we ought to conform all
our ſupplications.</p>
            <p>Third Cavil. I ſhould be aſhamed to
ſet down as ſo weak and ſimple, ſave that
ſome in our dayes, who pretend to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
put it in not onely to ſwell a number;
but lay much ſtreſs on the ſtrength there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
namely, that <hi>Chriſt made it in his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority,</hi>
before he was arrived at his full
perfection.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, as the folly of God is obſerved
by the Apoſtle wiſer than the wiſdom of
man, and the weakneſs of God ſtronger
then the ſtrength of man: ſo may I ſay,
that the <hi>minority</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was more than
the <hi>majority,</hi> his <hi>nonage</hi> than the <hi>full age,</hi>
his <hi>youth</hi> than the <hi>maturity</hi> of mankind. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<hi>Chriſt</hi> was, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 21. <hi>about thirty
years of age</hi> when he was baptiſed, the prime
conceived of mans life, after which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
they impair rather than improve.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114641:69"/>
Yea, beſides the Original ſtock of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
brought into the World at his birth,
he had already received a grand acceſſion
of the holy Spirit at his baptiſm.</p>
            <p>Fourth Cavil. There is nothing <hi>of a
Saviour</hi> in this prayer. It is but a <hi>legal Old
Teſtament prayer,</hi> whereas we are to ask all
things <hi>in the name of Jeſus,</hi> no mention
thereof herein. As therefore ſome <hi>Jews</hi>
have a diminitive opinion of the <hi>book of
Eſther,</hi> becauſe the word <hi>Jehova</hi> is not to
be found in all the extent thereof, on the
ſame account we may juſtly ground an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluation
of this prayer, wherein the
name of Jeſus doth not appear, which alone
is ſo of the <hi>Quorum</hi> in all ſupplications,
that without it they cannot be preſumed
acceptable in the <hi>Court of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The <hi>name of Jeſus,</hi> though not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally,
yet virtually and effectually is to
be found in this prayer. One cannot ſtir a
ſtep therein, but in the very Porch of this
prayer, and at the very Threſhold of this
Porch he meets with <hi>Jeſus a Saviour,</hi> in
thoſe words <hi>our Father.</hi> For fain would I
know who wrought, and brought this great
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114641:70"/>
and good alteration that God is beheld by
us under ſo comfortable a notion. How
came in the <hi>Kindred,</hi> whence ſprang this
our filial relation. Man at his laſt parting
with God, when expulſed <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> left him
his <hi>adverſary,</hi> his <hi>enemy,</hi> his <hi>enraged Judge,</hi>
whileſt he himſelf was looked on as an <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor</hi>
and <hi>Malefactour.</hi> Whereas now all
things are become new. Such who parted
in anger, meet in love, of <hi>Foes</hi> are become
<hi>Friends;</hi> Yea, <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Sons. Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now none effected this change ſave <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt</hi> by his mercifull Mediation. Is
not the hand of our Savour clean through
this prayer? Wherefore as ſome <hi>Phyſicians</hi>
give not in their receipts the bulk and maſs
of Herbs and Drugs, but onely their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
or their infuſions, which, though not ſo
great in quantity, are eaſier in the taking,
and ſtronger in the working: ſo in this
prayer, though neither the name of <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
Meſſiah, or Chriſt, is therein uſed, yet the
powerfull influence of both, and ſoveraign
effect is obvious to every judicious eye,
cauſing our confident and familiar addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114641:70"/>
to God, under the relation of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Fifth Cavil. The prayer is too ſhort, it
is not comprehenſive enough of all mens
neceſſities, which ought to be repreſented
therein. It is too narrow as not adequate
to the emergencies of all occaſions. The
<hi>Merchant</hi> wanteth a clauſe therein for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous
Gales to drive his Ship to a ſafe
Haven and gainfull market. The <hi>Souldier</hi>
wants a clauſe to cover his head from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and crown it with victory in the <hi>day of
battel.</hi> The <hi>Husband man</hi> diſcovereth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
becauſe no expreſs therein for ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
weather. The <hi>unmarried</hi> want a Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for loving <hi>Husbands</hi> &amp; dutifull <hi>Wives,</hi>
and the <hi>married</hi> for the continuance of the
goodneſs, or amendment of the badneſs of
thoſe to whom they are coupled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt in general. Whereas ſome
finde fault with the ſhortneſs of the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
know, length of prayer is made a crime
in Scripture, but never the brevity thereof
charged on any as a guilt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 14.
<hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
for you devour Widows houſes, and for</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:114641:71"/>
               <hi>a pretence make long prayers.</hi> Neither <hi>length</hi>
nor ſhortneſs is any whit conſiderable to
the acceptableneſs thereof, but the <hi>thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
of a prayer, when it is not empty and
hollow within, but well filled with Faith in
the heart and middle thereof.</p>
            <p>One bought a <hi>Map</hi> of the whole world,
and being himſelf an <hi>Athenian,</hi> Cavilled at
the <hi>Map</hi> as imperfect and defective, meerly
becauſe his own houſe in <hi>Athens</hi> was not
preſented therein. Whereas the whole
draught being not above a yard ſquare, it
fell to the proportion of all <hi>Europe</hi> not to
be a full foot. All <hi>Greece</hi> not to be a full
ſpan, <hi>Attica</hi> to be but a little ſpot, and
<hi>Athens</hi> to be a very ſpeck therein, ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
was it that his inviſible houſe
ſhould appear. As his cauſeleſs Cavil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
him ignorant in Geography, ſo
their exception diſcovereth their weakneſs
in Divinity, who expect a prayer to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularize
every mans neceſſities. What was
ſaid by the way of Hyperbole of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
that if all things which he did and
ſpake were written, the World were not
able to contain them, may it not be literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:114641:71"/>
ſpoken here, <hi>the World,</hi> that is, none of
the men therein could contain ſo volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
a prayer, deſcending to the <hi>minutes</hi>
of all mens wiſhes and wants. No memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſo tenacious as to retain it, no voice ſo
ſtrong as to pronounce it.</p>
            <p>Now although the particulars of every
mans wants, neither are nor can be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in this, or any other prayer; Yet here
we find their total ſum caſt up and couched
under general terms. For when it is ſaid,
<hi>give us this day our daily bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein the <hi>Souldier</hi> is remembred, who
prayeth for all things neceſſary for his
condition, when, ſaying, <hi>give us this day
our daily bread.</hi> Except it be ſo, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
guilty to himſelf that he is rather a
<hi>plunderer</hi> than a <hi>fighter,</hi> more maintaining
his livelyhood by violence than valour, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine
than conqueſt, he conceiveth himſelf
excluded, who cannot truly call it <hi>our daily
bread,</hi> as conſcious it is none of <hi>his,</hi> but
ſnatch'd from the true owners thereof.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Husband-man</hi> in this Petition pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for all things, which may tend and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the ſeaſonable fruits of the earth:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:114641:72"/>
A ſnowy <hi>January,</hi> froſty <hi>February,</hi> dry
<hi>March,</hi> ſhowry <hi>April,</hi> cold and windy <hi>May,</hi>
moiſt and fair <hi>June,</hi> hot and dry <hi>July,</hi> fair
and ſunny <hi>Auguſt,</hi> &amp;c. For how eaſily can
God deſtroy in one unſeaſonable <hi>Moneth</hi> in
<hi>Harveſt,</hi> what the concurrence of many
foregoing Moneths hath hopefully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</p>
            <p>In a word, let not the ſhortneſs of this
prayer (which being conſiſtent with ſo
much clearneſs is a principal honour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
be charged upon it for a defect. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
how it was intended for old folk who
were <hi>paſt their memories,</hi> for young Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
who as yet are not come to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,
for ſimple folk who never had, nor
will have memories.</p>
            <p>Laſt Cavil. This Prayer hath notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
been abuſed by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> to <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,</hi>
and therefore the more ſurely to
avoid offence, the uſe thereof may ſafely
be waved and declined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is confeſſed, that this moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Prayer hath been unworthily abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the <hi>Romiſh Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, by locking it up in the Latine
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:114641:72"/>
tongue, whereof the generalitie of their
<hi>Layetie</hi> is ignorant, praying, as S. <hi>Peter</hi>
ſpake at <hi>Chriſt</hi> his <hi>transfiguration,</hi> Luke 9.
33. <hi>Not knowing what they ſaid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe it hath been abuſed
in <hi>Spels</hi> and <hi>Exorciſms,</hi> to the great disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
of God, and advantage of <hi>Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe wronged with need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and impertinent repetitions of their
<hi>Beads,</hi> till their tenth <hi>bead</hi> become a <hi>Decu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi>
and the ſame ten times told over, a
<hi>Centurion</hi> in their mumbled and multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Devotions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is it worth our obſervation, that
the <hi>Lords prayer</hi> is abuſed by that very ſin,
for the rectifying and reforming whereof,
it was originally by our Saviour inſtituted
and intended. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 7. <hi>But when you
pray, uſe not vain repetitions as the Heathen
do, for they think they ſhall be heard for
their much ſpeaking.</hi> Now to repreſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
and prevent future <hi>tautologies,</hi> was
one principal end for which this prayer
was appointed. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
therefore pray.</hi> Therefore, that is that
you may not run on the rock of frivolous
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:114641:73"/>
repetitions, uſe this prayer ſo free from
<hi>Battologies,</hi> that excepting ſome neceſſarie
Pronouns of <hi>Our</hi> and <hi>Us,</hi> the ſame word
recurreth not twice in the whole extent
thereof.</p>
            <p>Yet ſee, I ſay, how the <hi>Papiſts</hi> abuſe the
ſame by repetitions. Doth it not argue a
very foul ſtomack, when the <hi>Phyſick</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to correct and remove the <hi>vicious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>
is turned againſt the true nature
thereof to increaſe the diseaſe of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi>
and how doth it ſpeak the maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the Popiſh practice, abuſing this
prayer to end with repetitions, deſigned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally
to prevent that ill cuſtome.</p>
            <p>However, though it cannot be denyed,
that the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have ſhamefully abuſed
this prayer, it followeth not, but that
Chriſtians may retain the true uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
They muſt <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> purge away Popiſh
ſuperſtitions from the ſame, but may not
on that pretence <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> utterly take it away
and expel it out of their publick or private
devotions.</p>
            <p>Firſt <hi>Uſe.</hi> It ſerveth to confute thoſe,
who over-eſteem the <hi>Lords prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:114641:73"/>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> Is this poſſible, are men capable
of exceſs in this kinde of giving too much
reverence or reſpect to this prayer, or any
other part and portion of Gods word.
Surely if it be an errrour, it is one on the
right hand, rather to be pitied and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
than publickly reproved.</p>
            <p>I confeſs an utter impoſſibility of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
any part if Gods word, but men
may be immoderate &amp; unadviſed in their
undiſcreet manifeſting &amp; declaring of their
eſteem of the <hi>Lords prayer,</hi> who in ſome
ſenſe may be ſaid to over-value it, though
in fine, and effect it doth prove an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuation
thereof.</p>
            <p>Such therefore are faultie in undiſcreet
expreſſion of their reſpect to the Lords
Prayer, who confine all perſons, at all
times to that alone, not allowing them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
to make uſe of other forms, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſhall require. Where we may obſerve,
That the Apoſtles of Chriſt in the <hi>Acts,</hi>
and elſewhere, on the emergencies of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
matters which called for their prayers,
expreſſed themſelves in other language,
accommodated to the occaſion, and waved
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:114641:74"/>
theſe very words of our Saviours preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,
as too general, and not coming up
cloſe enough to their urgent neceſſities.
Wherefore, though we will not ſay of the
Lords Prayer, <hi>none but it,</hi> I may ſay as
<hi>David</hi> did of <hi>Goliah's</hi> ſword, <hi>None is like
unto it.</hi> Though it be not to be uſed <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively</hi>
to ſhut out all other, yet is it <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently</hi>
to be preferred before the reſt.</p>
            <p>I will add one thing more, What me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals
ſoever the ring of thy devotions be
made of, the Lords Prayer is a good <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
to cloſe and conclude with, of what
wood ſoever the <hi>ſhaft of the darts</hi> of thy
prayers doth conſiſt, the Lords Prayer is
the beſt <hi>ſharp Pile to pierce heaven,</hi> and to
be put on at the end of thy own devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Greater is the folly of ſuch people, who
in a manner Idolatrize to the very words
and ſyllables of the Lords Prayer, as if
men were ſo ſtrictly tied up thereunto, as
not to recede one tittle from the ſame.
Whereas we may perceive ſome ſmall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the two forms preſented in
S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi>'s Goſpel. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:114641:74"/>
of one, and tranſpoſition of two or
three words, not to add, that the Doxolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie
inſerted in the one is omitted in the
other, as if purpoſely done to confute and
diſcompoſe the ſuperſtition of ſuch who
ſtick in ſuch ſyllabical curioſities.</p>
            <p>Truly I am afraid, if ſome might have
had their wills, Chriſtian libertie might
have been much prejudiced by the obtruſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this prayer alone upon their practice,
and dare boldly ſay, that ſome mens too
much crying up of the neceſſitie of this
prayer at all times hath occaſioned others
out of their <hi>ſpirit of oppoſition,</hi> a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchief
which mortal frailtie is much ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
(eſpecially in <hi>controvertial days,</hi> and
in the frowardneſs of the aged world) too
much to ſlight, neglect, and under-value
the ſame.</p>
            <p>For where the former humour of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing
this prayer hath infected their
<hi>hundreds,</hi> the latter of under-eſteeming the
ſame hath infected their <hi>thouſands;</hi> who in
their uncivil, not to ſay profane expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
have vented much contempt of this
holy &amp; heavenly prayer &amp; pattern thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:114641:75"/>
And here let me ſafely expreſs what I
fear may be the true cauſe thereof, and let
ſuch, who are faulty therein make a ſcruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
in their own conſciences, whether I ſpeak
not too much truth in this point. Are they
not out of charity with the Lords Prayer,
becauſe there is ſo much charity in the
Lords Prayer? There is one Petition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
which if they leave out <hi>they make the
Prayer lame, and if they put it in they make
themſelves liars.</hi> Namely, <hi>and forgive us
our treſpaſſes as we forgive them that treſpaſs
againſt us;</hi> doth not their revengefull and
vindicative hearts harbour ſo much ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
againſt their adverſaries, that they are
loath to forgive them, and deſire forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
from God, on the condition that they
forgive others? now, though I will not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively
affirm the ſame, yet becauſe it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
with it a great probability, Miniſters
may be jealous of their people with a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
jealouſie, as they may be jealous over

To conclude, Parents of Children, and
eſpecially Mothers, may take notice, that
their little ones in ſaying the Lords Prayer
are generally out at this Petition. And
forgive us our Treſpaſſes as we forgive
them that Treſpaſs againſt us. Not one
little Child of ten ſayeth it a right, and in
the right place; ſome paſs over and wholy
omit it, ſome tranſpoſe it, very few truly
pronounce it, whereof this the reaſon, Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
once and again in this Petition, is as
bad as a <hi>Shiboleth</hi> to try the liſping tongue
of a Child, there being a conflux of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Conſonants, &amp; ſome <hi>hard ſounded</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
ſo that it poſeth all the <hi>offices of ſpeech</hi>
in a Childs mouth diſtinctly to utter the
ſame.</p>
            <p>Let not Parents be angry with their
Children for not ſpeaking it, but with
themſelves for not practicing it, they beat
their Children for not ſaying it, God may
juſtly beat them for not doing it. I confeſs
ſuch forgiveneſs <hi>goeth againſt fleſh and
bloud,</hi> but fleſh and bloud ſhall never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the Kingdom of Heaven, we muſt
be acted with higher principles, if we
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:114641:76"/>
hope to come thither, whither the mercie
of God bring us through the merits of
<hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> Amen.</p>
